THIS COLLECTION OF PAPERS contains documentary accounts of several of Crowley's major magical workings. They deal--explicitly or tacitly-with the attainment of high degrees and grades in both the o. T. o. and the A:. A: .. Crowley considered Liber 418, The Vision and the Voice to be second in importance only to The Book of the Law. It docu-ments Crowley's initiation as a Master of the Temple (Magister Templi 8°=3\"), with a foreshadowing of his initiation to the grade of Magus. This edition presents his extensive technical commentary-an important work that has been unavailable in a reliable edition for nearly fifty years. It is published here with new material taken from the original manuscript notebooks of the working, the original typescript of its commentary, and anno-tated copies of its first edition in The Equinox 1(5) (1911). Many notes and illustrations have not appeared in print before. \" The Ab-ul-Diz Working\" led to the writing of Book 4. The A:.A:. requires that each Exempt Adept 7°=4° publish an orig-inal thesis on the universe. While Crowley claimed to have satis-fied this in his previous incarnation as the French author Eliphas Levi, he clearly confirmed his right to this grade by producing his brilliant original thesis on mankind and the universe, Book 4. \"Liber 415, The Paris Working\" served to confirm Crowley's innovative magical theories about the traditional teachings of the O.T.O., in which he was fully initiated in 1912. It is a hybrid ix"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"x THE EQUINOX paper or fiber, as its magical techniques pertain to both the grade of Adeptus Major in A:.A:., and the IXO and XIO of O.T.O.; for this reason it belongs in the canonical literature of both Orders, whose systems, though distinct and independent, closely intersect at this grade and these degrees in matters of magical technique. This 1914 working, and the earlier \"Bartzabel Working\" of 1910, show Crowley at the height of his powers as a full Major Adept 6°=5° A:.A: .. The Vision and the Voice and \"The Paris Working\" are both in A:.A:. Class AB, designating a combination of revealed and scholarly material. Also, both were fruit of Crowley's relation-ship with his early A:.A:. student, the poet Victor Benjamin Neuburg (Frater Omnia Vincam or Lampada Tradam). Neuburg also participated in the ritual work connected with \"Liber 325, The Bartzabel Working\" of 1910 E. v., published here for the first time. Another important working is also given its first publication, \"Liber 60, The Ab-ul-Diz Working.\" 1 This working, conducted in 1911 E. v. by Crowley with Mary Desti (Soror Virakam), led to the writing of Book 4. The Vision and the Voice is a primary scriptural source for the theogony of the Supernal Triad of the Crowned and Conquering Child, Chaos, and Babalon. Crowley taught that these, with their associated doctrines, were central to the work of the A:.A:. in the New JEon of Horus. He therefore adopted them as the essential religious theogony of its allied order, the O.T.O., in \"Liber XV\" (the Gnostic Catholic Mass) and else-where. Liber 418 should be studied in connection with two other Holy Books, \"Liber Liberi vel Lapidis Lazuli sub figura VII,\" received two years before Liber 418, and \"Liber Cheth vel Vallum Abiegni sub figura CLVI,\" received two years after Liber 418. Crowley's dramatic poem Liber 242, Aha! is another important account of the Master of the Temple. As the best introductions to the history and import of these workings are Crowley'S own accounts in his Confessions, these have been excerpted and adapted to introduce each working.2 I These works have been given numerical titles and placed in A:.A:. Class C for their first formal publication in this number. 2 The typescript was used; an unabridged edition is in preparation."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Editor's Introduction xi The papers published here are generally much more advanced than those published in The Equinox IV ( 1), Commentaries on the Holy Books and Other Papers. Crowley's commentary to Liber 418 assumes a much higher degree of familiarity with magical and Qabalistic technical terminology on the part of the reader. Due to limitations of space, this edition makes the same assumption, with this editor's annotations kept to a useful minimum. Tables giving Qabalistic and Enochian attributions, and numerous new illustrative figures, have been provided. The editorial work on Liber 418 was complicated by the wealth of source material. Sources and editorial procedures are discussed in the Editorial Notes at the end of the book. The listing of Works Cited gives bibliographic information for books and papers cited in the text; works cited in footnotes are by Crowley, unless noted otherwise. The Index is not exhaus-tive, but includes works cited, proper names, and technical terms with a particular bearing on the subjects of the papers. I wish to thank the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas at Austin, for making available note-books and papers relating to Liber 418, the \"Holy Hymns to the Great Gods of Heaven,\" \"The Bartzabel Working,\" and the diary entry for May, 1910.

Caitlin Aliciane assisted with copyreading during the rather arduous reverse proofreading of the text of Liber 418 against the manu-script notebooks. Clay Holden checked the proofs for accuracy in connection with technical Enochian questions, and provided his Enochian font and accurate artwork for the Sevenfold Table and the Sigillum Dei lEmeth. J. D. Laurence created the new artwork for the Alphabet of Arrows, the Vision of the Arrow, and the 30 lEthyrs on the Tree of Life. John Bowie of Moondog Design created the new artwork for the circles and triangles in Liber 418 and Liber 325, and the map for the Algerian diary. Robin D. Matthews read the proofs of the main text.

As my chela, I took Frater Omnia Vincam, a Neophyte of the A:.A:. dis-guised as Victor Neuburg.2 We merely wanted to rough it a bit in a new and interesting corner of the planet of which we were par-asites. We hastily bought a few provisions, took the tram to Arba, and after lunch started south, with no particular objective beyond filling our lungs with pure air and renewing the austere rapture of sleeping on the ground and watching the stars, serenely silent above us, till the face of Sleep, kissing our eyes, hid them from us in her heavy and holy hair. On the 21st we reached Aumale,3 after two nights in the open and one at a hovel that may have looked so tired on account of its Sisyphean strug-gle to pretend to be an hotel. 1 [Adapted from The Confessions of Aleister Crowley, typescript; here-inafter cited as Confessions.] 2 [Lat., \"I will conquer all,\" a motto of Victor Benjamin Neuburg (1883-1940), who became a Zelator 2°=9° A:.A:. and a VIC O.T.O.

Perhaps I happened to have in my rucksack one of my earliest magical notebooks,l where I had copied with infinite patience the Nineteen Calls or Keys obtained by Sir Edward Kelly from certain angels and written from his dictation by Queen Elizabeth's astrologer with whom he was working.2 The sixth book of their magical workings was translated by Casaubon, and is one of the very few genuine and interesting works on Magic of any period.3 Much of their work still defies explanation, though I and Frater Semper Paratus, an Adeptus Major of A:.A:., have spent much time and research upon it and cleared up many obscure points.4 The fact which stamps this working as sincere is this: over one hundred squares filled with letters were obtained-in a man-ner which no one has quite understood. Dee would have one or more of these tables (as a rule 49 x 49), some full, others lettered only on alternate squares, before him on a writing table. Kelly would sit at what they called the Holy Table, and gaze into a \"Shew-stone\" which, with some of the talismans on the table, may be seen in the British Museum. Kelly would see an angel in the Shew-stone, who would point with a rod to letters on one of these charts in succession. Kelly would report-\"He points to column 6, rank 31,\" and so on, apparently not mentioning the letter, which Dee found and wrote down from the \"table\" before him. This seems to imply that Kelly did not know what words would be formed. If he did, we must assume that he knew the position of each of the 2,401 letters in each of the tables, which 1 [This notebook is now at the Charles Deering McCormick Library, Special Collections, Northwestern University.] 2 [Elizabeth I's astrologer John Dee (1527-1608) was a central figure in Elizabethan England; his influence reached far beyond his esoteric pursuits. See Peter J. French, John Dee (1972).] 3 [Me ric Casaubon, A True and Faithful Relation of what Passed for Many Yeers between Dr. John Dee ... and some Spirits (1659), here-after cited as Casaubon; see Works Cited.] 4 Uames Thomas Windram (1877-1939) was also Mercurius xo, the head of the South African O.T.O. He was to have helped Crowley to complete \"Liber 84 vel Chanokh\" but never did so; his transcripts of Dee-Kelly material survive.]"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Liber 418 .t. The Vision and the Voice .t. Introduction 7 seems a somewhat surprising accomplishment. When the angel had finished, the message was rewritten backwards. (It had been dictated backwards as being too dangerous to communicate forwards-each word being in its nature so powerful that its direct communication would have evoked forces which were not wanted at that time.) These Keys or Calls being rewritten backwards, there appeared conjurations in a language which they called \"Eno-chian\" or Angelic. It is not a jargon; it has a grammar and syn-tax of its own. It is very much more sonorous, stately and impressive than even Greek or Sanskrit, and the English transla-tion, though in places difficult to understand, contains passages of a sustained sublimity that Shakespeare, Milton and the Bible do not surpass. To condemn Kelly as a cheating charlatan-the accepted view-is simply stupid. If he invented Enochian, and composed this superb prose, he was at worst a Chatterton with fifty times that poet's ingenuity and five hundred times his poeti-cal genius. 1 Can the Wings of the Wind understand your voices of Wonder? 0 You! the second of the First! whom the burning flames have framed in the depth of my Jaws! Whom 1 have prepared as cups for a wedding, or as the flowers in their beauty for the chamber of Righteousness! Stronger are your feet than the barren stone; and mightier are your voices than the manifold winds! For you are become a building such as is not, save in the Mind of the All-Powerful. -Second Key2 I prefer to judge Kelly from this rather than from stale scan-dal of people to whom any Magician, as such, smelt of sulphur. If, on the other hand, Kelly did not write this, he may of course have been a common ignorant scoundrel, one of whose abnor-malities was a faculty for seeing and hearing sublimities, just as a burglar or business man might be able to describe St. Paul's Cathedral far better than the Dean. 1 [The English poet Thomas Chatterton (1752-1770) was an inspira-tion to the English Romantic poets who viewed him as an unjustly neglected genius; he took his life by poison at age seventeen.] 2 [See \"Liber 84 vel Chanokh,\" Part II, The Equinox 1(8), p. 104.]"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"8 THE EQUINOX There are nineteen of these Keys: the first two conjuring the element called Spirit; the next sixteen invoke the Four Elements, each subdivided into four; the nineteenth, by changing two names, may be used to invoke anyone of what are called the thirty \"1Ethyrs\" or \"Aires.\" What these are is difficult to say. In one place we are told that they are \"Dominion extending in ever widening circles without and beyond the Watchtowers of the Universe,\" these Watchtowers composing a cube of infinite mag-nitude. Elsewhere, we find that the names of the angels which govern them are contained in the Watchtowers themselves; but (most disconcerting disenchantment!) they are identified with various countries of the earth, Styria, Illyria, etc., as if \"aire\" simply meant clime. I have always maintained the first definition. I suspected Kelly of finding Dee unsupportable at times, with his piety, pedantry, credulity, respectability, and lack of humour. I could understand that he broke out and made fun of the old man by spouting nonsense. The genuineness of these Keys, altogether apart from any crit-ical observation, is guaranteed by the fact that anyone with the smallest capacity for Magick finds that they work. Prove The Cenci to have been forged by Hogg, and conclude that Hogg was therefore a knave, well; but do not try to argue that Hogg, not being a poet, The Cenci must be drivel. 1 I had used these Keys a great deal, and always with excellent effect. In Mexico I thought I would discover for myself what the 1Ethyrs really were, by invoking them in turn by means of the nineteenth Key,2 and skrying in the Spirit vision, judge their nature by what I saw and heard. I investigated the first two Keys on November 14 and 17, 1900.3 \"The Vision and the Voice\" was mysterious and terrific in character. What I saw was not beyond my previous experience, 1 [Percy Bysshe Shelley, The Cenci: A Tragedy in Five Acts (1819). Thomas Jefferson Hogg (1792-1862) was Shelley's friend and biogra-pher; they were sent down from Oxford for collaborating on a pseud-onymous burlesque. The Cenci is not typical of Shelley's work, but he (not Hogg) is credited with its authorship by most authorities.] 2 [See page 27.] 3 [See The Temple of Solomon the King, The Equinox 1(3), p. 269.]"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Liher 418 1-The Vision and the Voice 1-Introduction 9 but what I heard was as unintelligible to me as Blake to a Bap-tist. I was encouraged by the evident importance of these results, but I found that I could no more force myself to go on to the twenty-eighth JEthyr than I could have thrown myself from a cliff. I accepted the rebuff; but, while dismissing the matter from my mind, managed to preserve the record throughout my wan-derings. I had not thought of continuing this work for nearly nine years; but at Aumale a hand suddenly smote its lightning into my heart, and I knew that now, that very day, I must take up The Vision and the Voice from the point where I had laid it down. We accordingly bought a number of notebooks, and after din-ner I invoked the twenty-eighth JEthyr by means of the nine-teenth Key. \"The Vision and the Voice,\" when we came to compare it with those of the twenty-ninth and thirtieth JEthyrs, exhibits the same peculiarities of subject and style. This is true also of the twenty-seventh JEthyr, and so to the twenty-fourth, yet there is a continuous advance towards coherence, both in each JEthyr itself and as regards its neighbour. The subject shows progressive solemnity and sublimity, as well as tendency to fit in with those conceptions of the Cosmos, those mystic laws of Nature, and those ideas of transcendental Truth which had been already foreshadowed in The Book of the Law and the more exalted of my trances. The deduction is not that my individuality was influencing the character of the Vision more and more as I got, so to speak, into my stride, for the interpretation of my Algerian Work made clear the meaning of the utterly obscure oracles obtained in Mexico. It became evident indeed that what stopped me in 1900 was simply that my Grade did not entitle me to go further than the twenty-ninth. I was, in fact, told that only a Master of the Temple can penetrate beyond a certain point. Of course anyone might use the Key for any JEthyr he chose, but he would either get no vision at all or expose himself to deception, and that probably of the deadly dangerous kind.

It is composed partly of sham pride prompted by self-love and self-doubt; partly by the insane impulse which the extremity of fear excites. There are plenty of V.C.'s2 who won the Cross, not \"for valour,\" but for lack of self-control over their crisis of cowardice. Discipline automatically made running away impossible; the only way out was to rush forward and do what-ever their innate instinct suggested. I know two v.c.'s myself who have no memory whatever of the act that won them the Cross. Similar psychology often makes young Magicians forget that to dare must be backed by to will and to know, all three being ruled by to keep silence. Which last means many things, but most of all so to control oneself that every act is done noise-lessly; all disturbance means clumsiness or blundering. The sol-dier may happen not to be hit, as he carries his wounded comrade through the barrage, but there is no luck in Magick. We work in a fluid world, where every movement is compensated at once. Light, sound, and electricity may be shut out, and so the effects of human thought, speech and action may divert or delay their action. But Magick, like gravitation, knows no obstacle. It is true that one can lift a fallen flower from the floor and keep it on a table; but the forces are at work all the time, and the action has been completely compensated by the redistribution of the stresses on every material object in the whole universe, by the shifting of the centre of gravity of the Cosmos, as my muscles sway from one state of equilibrium to another, and the flower exerts its energies from the mahogany instead of the carpet. Presumption in Magick is, therefore, sure to be punished-swiftly and justly. The error is one of the worst because it 1 [The Chaldcean Oracles of Zoroaster, § 183, ed. Westcott.

They puff up the pride of the fool still further; they flatter every foible, exhort him to acts of the most ridiculous kind, induce him to talk the most raving rubbish, and teach him to think himself the greatest man in the world-nay, not a man, but a god. He scores every fiasco as a success, takes every trifle as a token either of his sacrosanct sovereignty, or of the malice of hell whose hounds have been mustered to martyr him. His megalomania swings from maniacal exaltation to melancholia, with delusions of persecution. I have seen several cases of exactly this kind caused by so seemingly trivial a mistake as carelessness in consecrating the Circle for an evocation of an inferior Spirit; claiming a Grade in the Order without having made sure of having passed every test perfectly at every point; presuming to instruct a Probationer in his work before becoming a Neophyte; omitting essential points of Ritual as troublesome formalities; or even making excuses for error of the kind by which a man persuades himself that his faults are really due to the excess of his merits. I remember one man who attributed his failure to perform iisana properly to his exceptional physical energy. His body, said he, was endowed with such force that he must be meant to move it-it was all very well for ordinary men to try to sit still, but for him it was clearly an unnatural notion. Five years later, he told me he had become the strongest man on the planet, and begged me to empty my revolver at his chest if I didn't mind the bullets rebounding and breaking my windows. I spared my windows; besides, I hate to clean my revolver. He then offered to take me downstairs and watch him shoulder a motor car and run down the road with it. I told him that I knew he could do it, and wouldn't insult him by asking for proof. He went away, prancing and purring.

(He was himself one of seven survivors of fifty-odd men who went to Serbia to fight typhus.) He said that my mind possessed more analytical power and acumen than anyone he had ever known. (He was intimately associated with Einstein, and had spent many hours in talking over and working out his equations with him.) I could only look down and wonder if I was not wearing yellow stockings, and cross garters! I consider myself worth a place in the Museum of at least most provincial towns as a coward. What courage I have comes partly from shame at being so timid and sensitive. There are times when I cannot force myself to face a commonplace com-mercial person on perfectly routine business. I have funked keep-ing an appointment with a girl, both when I wanted her badly and when I didn't care the toss of a coin, either for fear that she might snub or insult me, or else that I might hurt her feelings or insult her by failure to persuade her that I was the ideal man. I have turned back from a climb that I know I could do with one hand tied behind me. I have backed away with apologetic amia-bility from a fat, bullying blackguard that I could have (and should have) admonished with a hook to the jaw.

Introduction I 5 This digression has been permissible because of its pertinence to my Algerian initiation. I may now resume the narrative. My method of obtaining \"the Vision and the Voice\" was as follows: I had with me a great golden topaz (set in a Calvary cross of six squares, made of wood, painted vermilion) engraved with a Greek cross of five squares charged with the Rose of forty-nine petals. I held this, as a rule, in my hand. After choosing a spot where I was not likely to be disturbed, I would take this stone and recite the Enochian Key, and, after satisfying myself that the invoked forces were actually present, made the topaz playa part not unlike that of the looking-glass in the case of Alice.1 I had learned not to trouble myself to travel to any desired place in the astral body. I realized that Space was not a thing in itself, merely a convenient category (one of many such) by reference to which we can distinguish objects from each other. When I say I was in any IEthyr, I simply mean in the state char-acteristic of, and peculiar to, its nature. My senses would thus receive the subtle impressions which I had trained them to record, so becoming cognizant of the phenomena of those worlds as ordinary men are of this. I would describe what I saw and repeat what I heard, and Frater O.V. would write down my words and incidentally observe any phenomena which struck him as peculiar. (For instance: I would at times pass into a deep trance so that many minutes might elapse between two succes-sive sentences.) Such observations may be contemptuously dismissed as imag-inary; but having already shown that all knowledge is equally an illusion, the thought is no inhibition. Yet there are different degrees of falsity, and critical methods which are valid within their capacity. Thus we trust our experience of perspective to correct the crude statement of our eyesight that the furthest house in a suburban street is smaller than the nearest. We may also verify our visions in various ways. They may also verify our visions in various ways. They must be coherent and consistent with themselves; they must not contradict the conclusions of other experiences whose warrants are identical; and before we t [Lewis Carroll, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland; see Works Cited.]"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"16 THE EQUINOX admit that they possess any value, they must increase our knowl-edge in such ways as would convince us in ordinary life that our interlocutor was an individual other than ourselves, and his information verifiably such as we could not have gained other-wise. It may seem as if such conditions could never be fulfilled, but it is quite easy to formulate them, and such visions as these under discussion are full of internal evidence of their authenticity. Let me give one example. The Angel of the twenty-seventh .lEthyr said: \"The word of the .lEon is MAKHASHANAH.\" I immediately discredited him; because I knew that the word of the .lEon was, on the contrary, ABRAHADABRA. Inquiry by the Holy Qabalah then showed me that the two words had the same numerical value, 418. The apparent blunder was thus an abso-lute proof that the Angel was right. Had he told me that the word was ABRAHADABRA, I should have thought nothing of it, arguing that my imagination might have put the words in his mouth. Let me illustrate the strength of such proof by material anal-ogy. Suppose I receive a telegram, signed Jobson (my lawyer), \"Your house has been burnt down.\" If I already know this from the caretaker, Jobson is merely confirming a known fact of which he and many others may be aware. The telegram might have been forged. Equally, if I have not heard from other sources, or if I have heard, on the contrary, that all is well, the telegram carries no conviction; it establishes a prima facie case for inquiry: no more. But if such inquiry confirms the telegram, it becomes prob-able that Jobson really dispatched it, though not with complete certainty; short of seeing him personally, the genuineness of the message is only a presumption. 1 Suppose, however, that I read \"London is burnt down. Job-son.\" The statement is incredible as it stands. Jobson and I, how-ever, have a secret understanding known to nobody else that any proper name in our communications shall stand for something else, discoverable by taking a = 1, b = 2, and so on, thus giving a number whose meaning is to be found in a code, in which each item of my estate represents a number. He has never used the 1 [See Book Four (Parts I-IV), rev. ed., appendix III.]"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Liber 418 1-The Vision and the Voice 1-Introduction 17 word \"London\" before. I add it up, refer to the code, and learn that London must mean my house. Now, whether I have already heard the news or no, and even if investigation proves the infor-mation to be false, I may at least feel sure that Jobson himself, and nobody else, was the author. If, in addition, it proves true, I may be sure that on this point his knowledge exceeds my own. Suppose, then, that the telegram proceeds to inform me of a number of other matters which I have no immediate means of verifying, I shall nevertheless be justified in assuming their authenticity and acting on the advice in just the measure of my confidence in Jobson's integrity and ability. Such is one of the simplest methods of criticizing the data afforded by visions. An isolated case need not convince one com-pletely, and it would be ridiculous to argue from a single test, however striking, that all communications purporting to come from the same source must be genuine and authoritative. It is the cumulative effect of repeated tests over a period of years that gives confidence. Incidentally, one acquires by experience the fac-ulty of knowing by instinct whether any given sight or sound is genuine; just as one learns to recognize the style of a writer or painter so that the most plausible imitations fail to deceive, hard as it may be to say in so many words what strikes one as suspicious. Now, The Book of the Law guarantees itself by so closely woven a web of internal evidence of every kind, from Qabalistic and mathematical proofs, and those depending on future events and similar facts, undeniably beyond human power to predict or to produce, that it is unique. The thirty JEthyrs being, however, only second in importance, though very far away, to that Book, the Lords of Vision were at pains to supply internal evidence, more than amply sufficient, that the revelations therein contained may be regarded as reliable. No doubt the proof appears stronger to me than to anyone else, because I alone know exactly what happened; also because many passages refer to matters personal to myself, so that only I can fully appreciate the dovetailings. Just so a man can never prove to another the greatness of Shelley as fully as he feels it himself, since his certainty partly depends on the secret and incommunicable relations of the poet with his own individual idiosyncrasies."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"18 THE EQUINOX I admit that my visions can never mean to other men as much as they do to me. I do not regret this. All I ask is that my results should convince seekers after Truth that there is beyond doubt something worthwhile seeking, attainable by methods more or less like mine. I do not want to father a flock, to be the fetish of fools and fanatics, or the founder of a faith whose followers are content to echo my opinions. I want each man to cut his own way through the jungle. We walked steadily to Bou-Saada, invoking the JEthyrs one by one, at convenient times and places, or when the Spirit moved me. As a rule, we did one JEthyr every day. We reached Bou-Saada on November 30th; on December 8th we started through the desert for Biskra, which we reached on December 16th, complet-ing the work on the 19th.1 Our adventures will be told later on. By the time I reached Bou-Saada and came to the twentieth JEthyr, I began to understand that these visions were, so to speak, cosmopolitan. They brought all systems of magical doctrine into harmonious relation. The symbolism of Asiatic cults; the ideas of the Qabalists, Jewish and Greek; the Arcana of the Gnostics; the Pagan Pantheon, from Mithras to Mars; the mysteries of Ancient Egypt; the initiations of Eleusis; Scandinavian Saga; Celtic and Druidical ritual; Mexican and Polynesian traditions; the Mysti-cism of Molinos no less than that of Islam, fell into their proper places without the slightest tendency to quarrel. The whole of the past JEon appeared in perspective, and each element thereof sur-rendered its sovereignty to Horus, the Crowned and Conquering Child, the Lord of the JEon announced in The Book of the Law. These visions thus crystallized in dramatic form the theoreti-cal conclusion which my studies of comparative religion had led me to adumbrate. The complexity of the whole vast subject resolved itself into shining simplicity. I saw with my own eyes, and heard with my own ears, the Truth in terms of Time. I understood directly that the formula of Osiris necessarily assumed all sorts of apparently incompatible forms as it was 1 [Crowley later came to realize that this date was an error in the MS notebook, as the 2nd lEthyr was completed on November 20th.

I saw also that Horus might reconcile all religions, it being possible now to bring all countries to agree on a few fundamental principles. Science had practically driven prejudice into the dark. Faith was little more than a shibboleth which no longer influ-enced opinion or action. I saw my way to combine a few simple incontrovertible scientific principles into a Law which would allow the loftiest aspirations to seek satisfaction in spiritual spheres, the religious instincts to realize their sublimity through ritual, and to assist the scientific mind to see that even the most materialistic conception of the Cosmos was ultimately mystical, that though mind might be merely a function of matter, yet that matter might equally well be represented as a manifestation of mind. The sequel will show how I fared in this ambitious adventure. Besides this, I became subtly aware that this Work was more than the impersonal exploration which I had meant to make. I felt that a hand was holding my heart, that a breath was whis-pering words in a strange tongue whose accents were yet both awful in themselves and like enchantments encompassing my essence with an energy mighty to work on my will in some inscrutable way. I began to feel-well, not exactly frightened; it was the subtle trembling of a maiden before the bridegroom. My ardour increased with every vision, and every vision became intenser and more intimate. I fortified myself by magical prac-tices. Two or three times I had found it difficult to get into the iEthyr; there were bars which I understood as not to be passed by the profane. The progressive sublimity and solemnity made me tremble lest I should not be worthy to behold the mysteries that lay in the future. So I consecrated myself by reciting this chapter of the Qur'an: Qui: Huw-AlIiihu a/:1ad; AlIiihu $amad; lam yalid wa lam yulad; wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan a/:1ad.1 a thousand and one times a day during the march, prostrating myself after each repetition.

My spiritual part had nothing to fear from the interference of my fagged-out physical frame, or the garrulence of the mind which I had flogged into dumb duty. In the nineteenth lEthyr appeared an Angel who revealed her-self as appointed to lead me personally through the initiation appointed. At the time I hardly understood this. I could not imagine that my personal progress could have any connection with what I still supposed to be purely objective phenomena; but in the eighteenth lEthyr the Angel thereof prepared me ceremoni-ally for the ceremony. In the seventeenth, the full magical mean-ing of equilibrium was made clear to me. \"Motion about a point is iniquity,\" \"Breath is iniquity\" and \"Torsion is iniquity.\" I understood that every disturbance (which makes manifestation possible) implies deviation from perfection. It is for this reason that my individuality (which distinguishes me from all other beings) involves the idea of injustice. Therefore, to penetrate beyond the Abyss, where iniquity cannot exist, my personal self-hood must be annihilated. The sixteenth lEthyr showed me how this might be done. My being must be dissolved in that of the infinite. This was symbolized by the destruction of the Demi-urgus, he being the creator of diversity. He being destroyed, I was shown an image of my true Self; and that Self vanishes, absorbed in a virgin. This told me that the climax of my love of the infinite was identification therewith. In the fifteenth lEthyr, the vision definitely took form as a cer-emony of initiation. I was examined by an assembly of adepts, and my right to the Grades of the Second Order admitted. I was then allowed to be entitled to the Grade of a Babe of the Abyss and a Master of the Temple. They continued the examination, and refused to accept me as a Magus.

And still I go on, struggling with the blackness. Now there is an earthquake. The veil is torn into thousands of pieces that go flying away in a whirling wind. And there is an all-glorious Angel before me, standing in the sign of Apophis and Typhon. On his Forehead is a star, but all about him is darkness, and the crying of beasts.

Therein will I appear, and reveal unto thee the mystery of VTA.1 For the Mystery thereof is great and terrible. And it shall not be spoken in sight of the sun.2 I must explain that we had climbed Daleh Addin, a mountain in the desert, as enjoined by the Angel during the previous night.3 I now withdrew from the iEthyr and prepared to return to the city. Suddenly came the command to perform a magical ceremony on the summit. We accordingly took loose rocks and built a great circle, inscribed with the words of power; and in the midst we erected an altar and there I sacrificed myself. The fire of the all-seeing sun smote down upon the altar, consuming utterly every particle of my personality. I am obliged to write in hiero-glyph of this matter, because it concerns things of which it is unlawful to speak openly under penalty of the most dreadful punishment; but I may say that the essence of the matter was that I had hitherto clung to certain conceptions of conduct which, while perfectly proper from the standpoint of my human nature, were impertinent to initiation.4 I could not cross the Abyss till I had torn them out of my heart.

I knew, of course, that my point-of-view was mere personal prejudice, and had trained myself to snub it by acting against the impulse; but there still were some things which I could not use in Magick, methods of working that seemed incompatible with my aspirations. At last, at this crisis, I obeyed my Angel. I made the act which I most feared and abhorred as detestable to my Holy Guardian Angel the very means of invoking Him. I made the most bestial blasphemy my holiest hymn. I forced the most infamous idea that I could imag-ine to interpret my most infinitely exalted intuition of Truth. 1 I remember nothing of my return to Bou-Saada. There was an animal in the wilderness, but it was not I. All things had become alike; all impressions were indistinguishable. I only remember finding myself on my bed, as if coming out of some catastrophe which had blotted out in utter blackness every trace of memory. As I came to myself, I found myself changed. I knew who I was and all the events of my life; but I no longer made myself the centre of their sphere, or their sphere the standard by which I measured the universe. It was a repetition of my experience of 1905, but far more actual. I did not merely admit that I did not exist, and that all my ideas were illusions, inane and insane. I felt these facts as facts. It was the difference between book-knowledge and experience. It seemed incredible that I should ever have fan-cied that I or anything else had any bearing on each other. All things were alike as shadows sweeping across the still surface of a lake-their images had no meaning for the water, no power to stir its silence. At ten minutes to ten I returned to the .tEthyr. I was instantly blotted in blackness. Mine Angel whispered the secret words whereby one partakes of the Mysteries of the Masters of the Temple. Presently my eyes beheld (what first seemed shapes of 1 [In the commentary to Liber 418 Crowley cites the XIO O.T.O.

Introduction 23 rocks) the Masters, veiled in motionless majesty, shrouded in silence. Each one was exactly like the other. Then the Angel bade me understand whereto my aspiration led: all powers, all ecsta-sies, ended in this-I understood. He then told me that now my name was Nemo, seated among the other silent shapes in the City of the Pyramids under the Night of Pan; those other parts of me that I had left forever below the Abyss must serve as a vehicle for the energies which had been created by my act. My mind and body, deprived of the Ego which they had hitherto obeyed, were now free to manifest according to their nature in the world, to devote themselves to aid mankind in its evolution. In my case I was to be cast out into the Sphere of Jupiter. My mortal part was to help humanity by Jupiterian work, such as governing, teach-ing, creating, exhorting men to aspire to become nobler, holier, worthier, kinglier, kindlier, and more generous. Finally, \"Fifty are the gates of understanding and one hun-dred and six are the seasons thereof, and the name of everyone of them is Death.\" I took this to mean that Aleister Crowley would die at the end of this time. The event has shown that it referred to my attainment of the Grade of Magus, for this took place at the exact moment here predicted. The thirteenth iEthyr explains the work which a Master of the Temple must do. He is hidden under the earth, and tends his garden. These gardens are of many kinds, but in every case he treats the roots of the flowers in various ways. Each flower gives birth to a maiden, save one, of which cometh a man-child who shall be Nemo after him. Nemo must not seek to know which flower this is. He must tend his garden with absolute impartiality. The twelfth iEthyr describes the City of the Pyramids, whose Queen is called BABALON, the Scarlet Woman, in whose hand is a Cup filled with the blood of the saints. Her ecstasy is nourished by the desires which the Masters of the Temple have poured from their hearts for Her sake. In this symbolism are many mys-teri~s concealed. One is that if a single drop of blood be withheld from Her Cup it putrefies the being below the Abyss, and vitiates the whole course of the Adept's career.

Now being bidden to cross it consciously, I asked the Angel, \"Is there not one appointed as a warden?\" I meant my Holy Guardian Angel, for whose Knowledge and Conversation I had abandoned all. The answer: \" Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani.\" 1 I knew that even my holiest, mine inmost self, might not protect me from the grim abominations of the Abyss.

There we made a Circle to protect the scribe, and a Triangle wherein the Abyss might manifest sensibly. We killed three pigeons, one at each Angle, that their blood might be a basis whereon the forces of Evil might build themselves bodies. The name of the Dweller in the Abyss is Choronzon, but he is not really an individual. The Abyss is empty of being; it is filled with all possible forms, each equally inane, each therefore evil in the only true sense of the word-that is, meaningless but malig-nant, insofar as it craves to become real. These forms swirl sense-lessly into haphazard heaps like dust devils, and each such chance2 aggregation asserts itself to be an individual, and shrieks, \"I am I!\" though aware all the time that its elements have no true bond; so that the slightest disturbance dissipates the delusion just as a horseman, meeting a dust devil, brings it in showers of sand to the earth. Choronzon appeared in many physical forms to Omnia Vin-cam, while I abode apart in my magical robe with its hood drawn over my face. He took the form of myself, of a woman whom Neuburg loved, of a serpent with a human head, etc. He could not utter the word of the Abyss, because there is no word; its voice is the insane babble of a multitude of senseless ejacula-1 [Grk., \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" See Mark 15:34 and Psalm 22:1.] 2 lThe TS has \"change,\" a probable corruption.]"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Liber 418 '\" The Vision and the Voice .t. Introduction 25 tions; yet each form spake and acted as if aping its model. His main object was to induce O.V. to leave the Circle, or to break into it; so as to obsess him, to live in his life. O.V. had many nar-row escapes, and once Choronzon made a long speech at a great pace to keep O.v. so busy writing it down that he would not notice that sand was being thrown from the Triangle so as to obliterate the Circle. The torrent of obscene blasphemy was beyond his power to keep up, concentration being impossible. It became an incoherent series of cries; then suddenly, perhaps catching the idea from O.V.'s mind, the demon began to recite \"Tom 0' Bedlam.\" There was now a gap in the Circle; and Choronzon, in the form of a naked savage, dashed through and attacked O.V. He flung him to the earth, and tried to tear out his throat with his froth-covered fangs. O.V. invoked the names of God, and struck at Choronzon with the Magical Dagger. The demon was cowed by this courageous conduct, and writhed back into the Triangle. O.V. then repaired the Circle; Choronzon resumed his ravings, but could not continue. He changed once more into the form of the woman whom O.V. loved, and exercised every seduction. O.V. stuck to his guns, and the dialogue took other forms. He tried to shake O.V.'s faith in himself, his respect for me, his belief in the reality of Magick, and so on. At last all the energy latent in the blood of the pigeons was exhausted by the successive phantoms, so that it was no longer able to give form to the forces evoked. The Triangle was empty. During all this time I had astrally identified myself with Choronzon, so that I experienced each anguish, each rage, each despair, each insane outburst. My ordeal ended as the last form faded; so, knowing that all was over, I wrote the Holy Name of BABALON in the sand with my Magical Ring, and arose from my trance. We lit a great fire to purify the place, and destroyed the Circle and Triangle. The work had lasted over two hours, and we were both utterly exhausted, physically and in every other way. I hardly know how we ever got back to Bou-Saada. Not till the evening of the following day did I feel strong enough to invoke the ninth JEthyr. A surprise was waiting for me. The nineteenth Key contains the text of the original curse on"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"26 THE EQUINOX creation. Each phrase formulates some calamity. I had always shuddered at its horror as I recited it. But now, the Abyss being crossed, and all its horror faced and mastered, the words of the Key suddenly thrilled with a meaning that I had never suspected. Each curse concealed a blessing. I understood that sorrow had no substance; that only my ignorance and lack of intelligence had made me imagine the existence of evil. As soon as I had destroyed my personality, as soon as I had expelled my Ego, the universe which to it was indeed a frightful and fatal force, fraught with every form of fear, was so only in relation to this idea \"I\"; so long as \"I am I,\" all else must seem hostile. Now that there was no longer any \"I\" to suffer, all these ideas which had inflicted suffering became innocent. I could praise the perfec-tion of every part; I could wonder and worship the whole. This attainment absolutely altered my outlook. Of course, I did not at once enter into full enjoyment. The habit of misunderstanding everything had to be broken, bit by bit. I had to explore every possibility, and transmute each base metal in turn into gold. It was years before I got into the habit of falling in love at first sight with everything that came my way. The ninth JEthyr shows this transformation symbolically. The Universe is represented as a maiden, all innocence, adorned with all perfection. The remaining JEthyrs partly complete the experience proper to the grade which I had attained, and partly shadow forth, in strangely obscure and formidable forms, the mysteries of the higher grades, or rather the guards to them. As I advanced, it became more and more difficult to obtain the vision. In the sec-ond JEthyr, for example, begun on the morning of December 18th, the work had to be broken off and the invocation repeated. Yet again I found the strain unsupportable, had to break off, and go to the hot baths of Hammam Salahine; and I continued, immersed to the neck in the hot sulphur spring. The water some-how soothed my nerves, enabling me to experience the JEthyr without physical collapse. Even so, I could not get to the end, and only did so after more than two days' concentrated conse-cration of myself."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Call or Key of the Thirty /Ethyrs [TH E 19TH KEY] MADARIATZA das perifa LIL,l cahisa micaolazoda saanire caosago od fifisa balzodizodarasa Iaida.

It is to be remarked that the last three rethyrs3 have ten angels attributed to them,4 and they therefore represent the ten Sephiroth. Yet these ten form but one, a Malkuth-pendant to the next three,5 and so on, each set being, as it were, absorbed in the higher.6 The last set consists, therefore, of the first three rethyrs with the remaining twenty-seven as their Malkuth. And the letters of the first three rethyrs are the key-sigils of the most exalted interpretation of the Sephiroth. I is therefore Kether; L, Chokmah and Binah; A, Chesed; N, Geburah; R, Tiphareth; z, Netzach; N, Hod; 0, Yesod. The geomantic correspondences of the Enochian alphabet form a sublime commentary.7 Note that the total angels of the rethyrs are 91, the numeration of Amen. 1 This note, written before invoking the 28th Aire, represents a crude and imperfect view. It is retained so as to show how very inadequate was the Understanding of the Seer; therefore, the immense superior-ity of the communicating Intelligences, and Their separate individual conscIOusness. 2 Query: November?

And now, after so long a while, the Angel3 lifts me, and takes me from the room,4 and sets me in a little chambers where is another Angel like a fair youth in shining garments, who makes me partake of the sacraments; bread, that is labour; and fire, that is wit; and a rose, that is sin; and wine, that is death.6 And all about us is a great company of angels in many-coloured robes, rose and spring-green, and sky-blue, and pale gold, and silver, and lilac, solemnly chanting without words. It is music wonderful beyond all that can be thought. 1 This quotation is from \"Liber VII\" 1:40. (This Book describes in detail the whole Attainment of the Grade of Magister Templi.) It had been given to the Seer, years previously; but he had not understood it, even with his Neschamah, as a coherent entity. Nor does he even yet (An. XXI, 0 in ®) understand it with his Ruach. Incidentally the full meaning of this Book 418, as a connected account of his Initia-tion, is only now becoming clear to him in the process of writing this Commentary upon it. For N . o. X., see note above, 20th Aire. Observe that although the Exempt Adept, or the Babe of the Abyss, is com-pletely baffled by the circumstances, and in no wise understands the situation, his Chiah, the Magician in him, acts with sublime confi-dence and correctness. 2 The quotation, accepting annihilation, instantly destroys the myriad of insane images which hastened to occupy the vacuum created by the leap of the Exempt Adept into the Abyss. Had he faltered, he would have become-against his will-a \"Black Brother.\" But this being involuntary, he would not have attempted to maintain his coherence, as the Black Brothers do. He would, therefore, have been destroyed at once; that is, to outward appearances, he would have become a demented babbler. Spiritists present this phenomenon, on a much lower plane, and in a diluted form; though with them, as with the average Theosophist, there is usually a certain degree of obses-sion by pet phantoms-a \" Chinese Guide,\" or \"Koot Hoomi,\" or what not-to lend a species of semi-organized structure to the legions of disconnected ideas that throng their disintegrated gray matter."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Liber 418 & The Vision and the Voice & 18th /Ethyr 113 3 [from page opposite.] (No Angel has been mentioned. The Seer was lost to being.) In this preliminary-and so to say, symbolic-crossing of the Abyss, His Holy Guardian Angel comes to the rescue of the Aspirant. Contrast the unspeakable Terror of the actual Crossing, when that Angel Himself abandons the Seer (see 11th Aire, the last paragraph). Exactly how the Angel dealt with the Seer in this 20 minutes of earthly time is impossible to say; for he has no memory soever-nor had he even at the time-of what took place. We may, however, deduce from that fact that the Communion took place in a sphere beyond even Neschamah. It may well have been a Quintessence of Union sufficiently intimate to have identified the Seer with his Angel so perfectly as to have given him the right to make the passage fully, in every sense; and to have ensured his safety on the way. For the Angel cometh forth from above the Abyss, and dwelleth of right in the Bosom of the Great Mother. But the Angel deals not with the lit-tle pile of dust in the City of the Pyramids (see 14th JEthyr), but with the Star that is cast forth to give light to the Earth. 4 This pyramid, where is the Pastos, is the Chamber of Annihilation. The Pastos contains the Essence of the Aspirant, and is in a Chamber containing the Essence of the Universe. This is all ready to be burnt up in the Energy of Aspiration to the Creative Annihilation, the Ruby Pyramid or Phallus. Finally, this Pyramid is within a Cone, a figure combining the straight line and the circle (Rose and Cross in their purest form) representing the new Universe into which the old is to be transmuted. It is established, like all types of Universe, upon the Four Elements (divided into 72) which are the conditions of manifested Existence. (The elements are not only \" material\"; they include categories like \"Time,\" \"Space,\" and \"Causality.\") 5 This is the Birth-Chamber, where the Magister Templi awakes from the Oblivion of the Abyss. 6 These sacraments furnish him with the material for his new Life. Bread (9 ) is labour, the nourishment of his being. Fire is the percep-tion of clear understanding (Neschamah). The Rose (8 ) is Sin, the restriction which prevents him from being dissolved in pure light (Kether), for his Oath as a Master of the Temple is to deny himself the enjoyment of that privilege, for the sake of the Love that he bears to Mankind; wherefore is that Sin fragrant with the scent of Love. Finally, Wine (\\7 ) is Death, the Ecstasy of transmuting all things into Joy by the Sacrament of Creative Love."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"114 THE EQUINOX And now we go out of the chamber; 1 on the right is a pylon, and the right figure is Isis, and the left figure Nephthys, and they are folding their wings over, and supporting Ra.2 I wanted to go back to the King's Chamber.3 The Angel pushed me away, saying: \"Thou shalt see these visions from afar off, but thou shalt not partake of them save in the manner prescribed.

But the original combination of samkhiiras (tendencies-the elements of the Character of the Man) is void of the Ego. Ahamkiira (the ego-making faculty) has been assimilated. The samkhiiras are, however, still linked by the karma of the Adept; for they had to be most strongly knit by him that he might be able to concentrate their whole Energies upon the Great Work of abandoning in a single gesture \"all that he has, and all that he is.\" They accordingly hold together: his Will has been accomplished, and he is free from them; but they depend upon the Elements which composed that true Will, which, since he has suc-ceeded, can only be the Sublime Passion for Mankind to help it to \"conquer Space, and lastly climb / The walls of Time, / And by the golden path the great have trod / Reach up to God.\" [Crowley, \"Astrology,\" from Songs of the Spirit (1898), in Collected Works, vol. I, p. 54.] A phenomenon of this nature thus appears \"as a morn-ing star, or as an evening star, to give light to them that sit in dark-ness, and in the shadow of death.\" [An apparent paraphrase of the 14th JEthyr, p. 142.] This is then the man himself, save that his sep-arate individuality is no longer present; it is replaced by this single passion to rescue Mankind. 3 The Seer's first impulse was to proceed with the Work on which he had been engaged when the Dissolution of his Being took place. 4 As stated in a previous Aire, these higher visions are not to be obtained by the methods applicable to less exalted spheres.

Several times did the Scribe threaten to put a curse upon the demon; but ever, before he uttered the words of the curse, did the demon obey him. For himself, he knoweth not the words of the curse. Also is it meet to record in this place that the Scribe several times whistled in a Magical manner, which never before had he attempted, and the demon was apparently much discomfited thereat. Now knoweth the Scribe that he was wrong in holding much converse with the demon; for Choronzon, in the confusion and chaos of his thought, is much terrified by silence. And by silence can he be brought to obey. For cunningly doth he talk of many things, going from subject to subject, and thus he misleadeth the unwary into argument with him. And though Choronzon be easily beaten in argument, yet, by disturbing the attention of him who would command him, doth he gain the victory. For Choronzon feareth of all things concentration and silence: he therefore who would command him should will in silence: thus is he brought to obey. This the Scribe knoweth; for that since the obtaining of the Accursed Tenth JEthyr, he hath held converse with Choronzon. And unexpectedly did he obtain the information he sought after having long refused to answer the demon's speeches. Choronzon is dispersion; 1 and such is his fear of concentration that he will obey rather than be subjected to it, or even behold it in another. The account of the further dealings of Choronzon with the Scribe will be found in the Record of Omnia Vincam.2 1 [The MS has \"distraction. \"] 2 [Not believed extant.]"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"172 THE EQUINOX ~Li1 THE CRY OF THE 9TH iETHYR, WHICH IS CALLED ZIP I (THE TERRIBLE CURSE that is the Call of the Thirty iEthyrs sounds like a song of ecstasy and triumph; every phrase in it has a secret meaning of blessing.)

His only warning had been the intuitive feeling that the Call was really a Rejoicing at the Opening of the 9th Aire. And he had thought this merely subjective, due to the Relief of having passed through the Abyss.

The body of the Seer is rested in a waking sleep that is deeper than sleep, and his mind is still; he seems like a well in the desert, shaded by windless palms. 1 The Seer was only too well aware that, considering the dire straits to which He was put to obtain the Second Aire, He was surely incapa-ble of penetrating the First. In fact, only a full Magus could pierce the Second properly, and for the First none but an Ipsissimus would be competent. This apprehension was in fact justified.

The idea of general 'rites' developed during this summer from the casual rituals adopted during the Anhalonium [mescaline] experiment.

Here was a startling innovation in tradition.2 I wrote, moreover, a ritual on entirely new principles. I retained the Qabalistic names and for-mulre, but wrote most of the invocation in poetry. The idea was to work up the magical enthusiasm through the exhilaration induced by music. I obtained a great deal of valuable knowledge from the spirit, but the most interesting item was this: Marston, remembering his official duty, asked: \"Will nation rise up against nation?\", fol-lowed by more detailed inquiries on receiving an affirmative answer. We thus learnt that within five years from that date there would be two wars; the storm centre of the first would be Tur-key, and that of the second would be Germany, and the result would be the destruction of these two nations. I only remem-bered this after reaching New York at the end of 1914.

INTRODUCTIONI THE AUTUMN [of 1911 E.V.] had a new experience in store for me. The current of my life was once more to be sud-denly turned; and as usual, this critical change came about as the result of a series of casual chances. I was caught in a web, some of whose strands had been woven as early as 1902. That fertile passage through Paris on my return from Chogo Ri, which had already born so much fruit in my life, had still some seed-which now came to harvest. I have mentioned2 Nina Olivier, whom I loved so well and sang so passionately. In my sunlight she had blossomed into La Dame de Montparno, the Queen of the Quarter. But I have not mentioned an obscure prig whom I will call Monet-Knott,3 whom I had met through my fiancee, the \"Star\" to Nina's \"Garter.\" This brainless and conceited youth had become accompanist to the greatest dancer of her generation. Let me call her Lavinia King.4 She, first and never equalled, had understood and demonstrated the Art of dancing as a complete language of the affections of the mind 1 [Adapted from Crowley's account of this working in his Confessions, typescript; see also the abridged ed., chap. 70.] 2 [Elsewhere in his Confessions.] 3 [Hener Skene, who appears as Monet-Knott in Moonchild (1929).] 4 [Isadora Duncan, who appears as Lavinia King, ibid.] 289"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"290 THE EQUINOX and heart. Knott and Nina [ ... ] had contracted a liaison. I met Knott for the second time [and] I saw a fair amount of him in the next few weeks; so that, running across him in London on Octo-ber 11th, he took me after supper to the Savoy to meet Miss King.1 A boisterous party was in progress. The dancer's lifelong friend, whom I will call by the name she afterwards adopted, Soror Virakam, was celebrating her birthday. This lady, a mag-nificent specimen of mingled Irish and Italian blood, possessed a most powerful personality and a terrific magnetism which instantly attracted my own. I forgot everything. I sat on the floor like a Chinese God, exchanging electricity with her. After some weeks' preliminary skirmishing, we joined battle along the whole front; that is to say, I crossed to Paris, where she had a flat, and carried her off to Switzerland to spend the winter skating. Arrived at Interlaken, we found that Murren was not open, so we went on to St. Moritz, breaking the journey at Zurich. This town is so hideous and depressing that we felt that our only chance of living through the night was to get superbly drunk, which we did ... (Let me emphasize that this wild adventure had not the remot-est connection with Magick. Virakam was utterly ignorant of the subject. She had hardly so much as a smattering of Christian Sci-ence. She had never attended a seance, or played Planchette.) ... Lassati sed non satiati2 by midnight. I expected to sleep, but was aroused by Virakam being apparently seized with a violent attack of hysteria, in which she poured forth a frantic torrent of senseless hallucination. I was irritated and tried to calm her. But she insisted that her experience was real; that she bore an impor-tant message to me from some invisible individual. Such nonsense increased my irritation. But-after about an hour of it-my jaw fell with astonishment. I became suddenly aware of a coherence in her ravings, and further that they were couched in my own lan-guage of symbols. My attention being thus awakened, I listened to what she was saying. A few minutes convinced me that she was 1 This incident and its sequel are described in The Net, Chapter One.

Let me briefly explain the grounds for this belief. I have already set forth, in connection with the Cairo Working, some of the safeguards which I habitually employ. Virakam's vision con-tained elements perfectly familiar to me. This was clear proof that the man in her vision, whom she called Ab-ul-Diz, was acquainted with my system of hieroglyphics, literal and numerical, and also with some incidents in my magical career. Virakam herself cer-tainly knew nothing of any of these. Ab-ul-Diz told us to call him a week later, when he would give further information. We arrived at St. Moritz and engaged a suite in the Palace Hotel. My first surprise was to find that I had brought with me exactly those Magical Weapons which were suitable for the work proposed, and no others. But a yet more startling circumstance was to come. For the purposes of the Cairo Working, Ouarda and I had brought two abbai; one, scarlet, for me; one, blue, for her. I had brought mine to St. Moritz; the other was of course in the possession of Ouarda. Imagine my amazement when Virakam produced from her trunk a blue abbai so like Ouarda's that the only differences were minute details of the gold embroidery! The suggestion was that the Secret Chiefs, having chosen Ouarda as Their messenger, could not use anyone else until she had become irrevocably disqualified by insanity. Not till now could her place be taken by another; and that Virakam should possess a duplicate of her Magical Robe seemed a strong argument that she had been consecrated by Them to take the place of her unhappy predecessor. She was very unsatisfactory as a clairvoyant; she resented these precautions. She was a quick-tempered and impulsive woman, always eager to act with reckless enthusiasm. My cold scepticism no doubt prevented her from doing her best. Ab-ul-Diz himself constantly demanded that I should show \"faith\" and warned me that I was wrecking my chances by my attitude. I prevailed upon him,. however, to give adequate proof of his existence and his claim to speak with authority. The main purport of his message was to instruct me to write a book on my system of Mysticism and Magick, to be called Book Four, and told me that by means of this book, I should prevail against public neglect. I saw no objection to writing such a book; on quite rational grounds, it"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"292 THE EQUINOX was a proper course of action. I therefore agreed to do so. But Ab-ul-Diz was determined to dictate the conditions in which the book should be written; and this was a difficult matter. He wanted. us to travel to an appropriate place. On this point I was not wholly sat-isfied with the result of my cross-examination. I know now that I was much to blame throughout. I was not honest either with him, myself, or Virakam. I allowed material considerations to influence me, and I clung-oh triple fooll-to my sentimental obligations towards Laylah.1 We finally decided to do what he asked, though part of my objection was founded on his refusal to give us absolutely definite instructions. However, we crossed the Passes in a sleigh to Chia-venna, whence we took the train to Milan. In this city we had a final conversation with Ab-ul-Diz. I had exhausted his patience, as he mine, and he told us that he would not visit us any more. He gave us his final instructions. We were to go to Rome and beyond Rome, though he refused to name the exact spot. We were to take a villa and there write Book Four.2 I asked him how we might rec-ognize the right villa. I forget what answer he gave through her, but for the first time he flashed a message directly into my own consciousness. \"You will recognize it beyond the possibility of doubt or error,\" he told me. With this, a picture carne into my mind of a hillside on which were a house and garden marked by two tall Persian Nuts. 1 [See Liber 418, note 7, p. 145 infra.

Introduction 293 The next day we went on to Rome. Owing to my own Ananias-like attempt to \"keep back part of the price,\" 1 my relations with Virakam had become strained. We reached Naples after two or three quarrelsome days in Rome and began house-hunting. 1 imagined that we should find dozens of suitable places to choose from, but we spent day after day scouring the city and suburbs in an automobile, without finding a single place to let that corre-sponded in the smallest degree with our ideas. Virakam's brat-a most god-forsaken lout-was to join us for the Christmas holidays, and on the day he was due to arrive we motored out as a forlorn hope to Posilippo before meeting him at the station at four o'clock or thereabouts. But the previous night Virakam had a dream in which she saw the desired villa with absolute clearness. (I had been careful to say nothing to her about the Persian Nuts, so as to have a weapon against her in case she insisted that such and such a place was the one intended.) After a fruitless search we turned our automobile towards Naples, along the crest of Posilippo. At one point there is a small side lane scarcely negotiable by motor, and indeed hardly percep-tible, as it branches from the main road so as to form an acute-angled \"Y\" with the foot towards Naples. But Virakam sprang excitedly to her feet, and told the chauffeur to drive down it. 1 was astonished, she being hysterically anxious to meet the train, and our time being already almost too short. But she swore pas-sionately that the villa was down that lane. The road became con-stantly rougher and narrower. After some time, it came out on the open slope; a low stone parapet on the left protecting it. Again she sprang to her feet. \"There,\" she cried, pointing with her fin-ger, \"is the villa I saw in my dream!\" 1 looked. No villa was visi-ble. I said so. She had to agree; yet stuck to her point that she saw it. I subsequently returned to that spot and found that a short sec-tion of wall, perhaps fifteen feet of narrow edge of masonry, is just perceptible through a gap in the vegetation. We drove on; we came to a tiny piazza, on one side of which was a church. \"That is the square and the church,\" she exclaimed, \"that I saw in my dream!\" 1 [Acts 5:2.]"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"294 THE EQUINOX We drove on. The lane became narrower, rougher, and steeper. Little more than a hundred yards ahead it was completely \"up,\" blocked with heaps of broken stone. The chauffeur protested that he would be able neither to turn the car nor to back it up to the square. Virakam, in a violent rage, insisted on proceeding. I shrugged my shoulders. I had got accustomed to these typhoons. We drove on a few yards. Then the chauffeur made up his mind to revolt and stopped the car. On the left was a wide open gate through which we could see a gang of workmen engaged in pretending to repair a ramshackle villa. Virakam called the fore-man and asked in broken Italian if the place was to let. He told her no; it was under repair. With crazy confidence she dragged him within and forced him to show her over the house. I sat in resigned disgust, not deigning to follow. Then my eyes suddenly saw down the garden, two trees close together. I stooped. Their tops appeared. They were Persian Nuts! The stupid coincidence angered me, and yet some irresistible instinct compelled me to take out my notebook and pencil and jot down the name written over the gate-Villa Caldarazzo. Idly, I added up the letters 6 + 10 + 30 + 30 + 1 and 20 + 1 + 30 + 4 + 1 + 200 + 1 + 7 + 7 + 70. Their sum struck me like a bullet in my brain. It was 418, the number of the Magical Formula of the JEon, a numerical hiero-glyph of the Great Work. Ab-ul-Diz had made no mistake. My recognition of the right place was not to depend on a mere matter of trees, which might be found almost anywhere. Recognition beyond all possibility of doubt was what he promised. He had been as good as his word. I was entirely overwhelmed. I jumped out of the car and ran up to the house. I found Virakam in the main room. The instant I entered I understood that it was entirely suited for a temple. The walls were decorated with crude frescoes which somehow sug-gested the exact atmosphere proper to the Work. The very shape of the room seemed somehow significant. Further, it seemed as if it were filled with a peculiar emanation. This impression must not be dismissed as sheer fancy. Few men but are sufficiently sensitive to distinguish the spiritual aura of certain buildings. It is impossi-ble not to feel reverence in certain cathedrals and temples.

Introduction 295 their own; some depress, some cheer; some disgust, others strike chill to the heart. Virakam of course was entirely certain that this was the villa for us. Against this was the positive statement of the people in charge that it was not to be let. We refused to accept this asser-tion. We took the name and address of the owner, dug him out, and found him willing to give us immediate possession at a small rent. We went in on the following day, and settled down almost at once to consecrate the Temple and begin the book. The idea was as follows. I was to dictate, Virakam to tran-scribe, and if at any point there appeared the slightest obscurity-obscurity from the point of view of the entirely ignorant and not particularly intelligent reader; in a word, the average lower-class man in the street-I was to recast my thoughts in plainer lan-guage. By this means we hoped to write a book well within the compass of the understanding of even the simplest-minded seeker after spiritual enlightenment. The programme was cut short. The secret contest between the Will of Virakam and my own broke into open hostility. A serious quarrelled to her dashing off to Paris. She repented almost before she arrived, and telegraphed me to rejoin her, which I did, and we went together to London. There, however, an intrigue resulted in her hastily marrying a Turkish adventurer who proceeded to beat her, and, a little later, to desert her. 1 Her hysteria became chronic and uncontrollable; she took to furious bouts of drinking which culminated in delirium tremens. The partial failure of our partnership was to some extent, without doubt, my own fault. I was not wholehearted, and I refused to live by faith rather than by sight. I cannot reproach myself for this; for that, I have no excuse. I may nevertheless express a doubt as to whether full success was in any case possi-ble. Her own masterless passions could hardly have allowed her to pass unscathed through the ordeals which are always imposed upon those who undertake tasks of this importance. 1 [This was Veli Bey, who appears in Moonchild (1929) as Abdul Bey.]"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"LIBER LX The Ab-ul-Diz Working PROLOGUEI AN ACCOUNT OF A COMMUNICATION made to Frater Perdurabo in 1904 l/I-X2 through the seer Ouarda is to be found in The Equinox 1(7).3 This Ouarda, disobedient unto her high calling, suffered in detail those things prophesied of her, and the final catastrophe, or an equivalent even more terrible, occurred on the 27th of Septem-ber, 1911 l/I-X.

He returned to the Savoy Hotel on the 29th, somewhat dis-turbed in his mind by the silence with which his letters to her had been treated, but, meeting her, forgave her, and passed several hours in her company, the parting being dictated by her being obliged to take the 11 o'clock train to Paris on the morning of the 30th. He rejoined her at lunchtime on the 14th of November at her flat in Paris, took her to Montparnasse on the night of the 18th, and left Paris with her for Switzerland on the evening of the 19th. The night of the 21st was spent at the National Hotel, Zurich. At about midnight she was in a state of excitement, exhaus-tion, and hysteria so fierce and terrible as to be almost alarming to Fra. P. I must mention that he had hitherto regarded her only as a voluptuous and passionate woman of the world, or perhaps in part as a fellow-artist; no thought of her use in his occult work had ever crossed his mind. However, the state described, one little removed from that of an amorous but infuriated lioness, suddenly and without warning gave place to a profound calm hardly distinguishable from pro-phetic trance, and she began to describe what she was \"seeing.\" Fra. P.'s old sceptical attitude had in no wise been weakened by the lapse of years; he attached no importance to, or interest (save artistic interest) in, what he regarded as a morbid phenome-non due to over-excitement of Bacchus and Eros, and he cannot particularize the order of the events now to be related, although he wrote them down an hour later when they assumed an occult importance. The lady had I think on the previous day (the 20th) \"seen\" in a dream the \"head of the 5 White Brothers\" who told her that \"it was all right.\" This person now again appeared to her.

On his finger was a ring; under a transparent \"glass\" top it had a white feather or \"bird.\" Subse-quently she described this as the feather of a \"bird of Paradise,\" or something similar. His first counsel to the seer was \"to make herself perfectly pas-sive\" in order that he might communicate freely. He then said that the 5 White Brethren were \"turning red\" and \"here is a book to be given to Fra. p.l The name of the book is Aba, and its number IV.\" It was the correspondence of name and number that made Fra. P. think there might be something in the communication.2 In the room seen was also a black-headed \"Turk\" or \"Egyp-tian\" wearing a tarbush and a red sash; his name is \"Jezel\"3 (?) and he has one hand covered with crocodile skin. He is hunting this book; but (said the Ancient) Fra. P. will get it. There was a lot, too, about the Book VII; curious in view of the fact that the words (\"[Liber] VII\" V:46) \"only by passive love shall he avail\" had sprung up in P.'s mind when she mentioned the old man's first command. P. then began to \"challenge\" the old man. The seer was not seeing clearly, and was terribly afraid of the whole business. He gave his name as (?) Ab-ul-Diz. P. asked \"What about 78?\" and he replied that he was 78.4 1 She did not know Fra. P. as such. This is not a \"test.\" 2 ABA = ~Cl~ = 4. 3 Jezel = \"i' = 57; Veli = \",~, = 57. This suggests a possible identity between the Turk in the vision and the actual Turk who ultimately spoilt the work, Veli Bey; but I do not like the spelling, and Soror Virakam, on meeting Veli Bey's father, Elias Pasha, recognized him immediately as Jezel.

I shut off my hearing in the way I have learnt to do; but after some five minutes' babbling she pierced my defenses by some remark concerning an egg under a palm tree. This aroused me instantly, for the last instruction given to myself and Soror Virakam [in \"The Ab-ul-Diz Working\"] was to go to the desert and look for just that thing. I saw then a kind of continuity between those visions and these. It was as if the intelligence communicating were taking up the story at the point at which it had been dropped. Of course, it might have been a mere coincidence. But that point could be easily settled by cross-examina-tion. I began to ask questions. The Camel said that someone, whom she called 'the Wizard,' wished to communicate with me. I am not a spiritualist who accepts any message as of divine origin.

INTRODUCTIONI DURING THE AUTUMN [of 1913 E.V.] and until the solstice I went on with my regular work as usual, but with a subconscious awareness that my future lay in other fields; something was sure to happen to change the whole current of my life. Subtly enough, this change came about by diverting me from the public action to which I had so long been bound by the sheer necessity of producing The Equinox on definite dates. I began to pay more attention to my own personal progress. It must here be explained that my innate diffidence forbade me to aspire to the Grade of Magus in any full sense. Such beings appear only in every two thousand years or so. I knew too well my own limitations. It is true that I had been used as a Magus in the Cairo Working; that is, I had been chosen to utter the Word of a New lEon. But I did not regard this as being my Word. I felt myself ridiculously unworthy of the position assigned to me in The Book of the Law itself. When therefore I proposed to devote myself to my own initiation, I meant no more than this: that I would try to perfect myself in the understanding and powers proper to a Master of the Temple. 1 [This introduction has been adapted from the typescript of Crowley's Confessions; see also the abridged ed., pp. 719-723.] 347"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"348 THE EQUINOX At the end of 1913, I found myself in Paris with a Zelator of the Order, Frater L.T.1 I had been working on the theory of the magical method of the O.T.O., and we decided to test my conclu-sions by a series of invocations.2 We began work on the first day of the year, and continued without interruption for six weeks. We invoked the gods Mer-cury and Jupiter, and obtained many astonishing results of many kinds, ranging from spiritual illumination to physical phenom-ena. As an example of actual intellectual illumination, [see] the very impressive identification of the Christ of the Gospels with Mercury.3 This came as a complete surprise, we having till then considered him as an entirely Solar symbol connected especially with Dionysus, Mithras and Osiris. Our occasional failures produced results as striking and instructive as our successes. For instance, having made an error in invoking Mercury, and thus having created a current of force contrary to his nature, we observed that events of a Mercurial character, no matter how normal, failed to occur. For one thing, all communications with the outer world were completely cut off for some time. It had been arranged that I should receive a daily report from London from my secretary. None arrived for five days; and that although nothing had gone wrong in London. No explanation was ever forthcoming. This is one of the many inci-dents tending to similar conclusions, all explicable only on the theory that the natural energy which is normally present, and is necessary to the occurrence of certain types of event, had some-how been inhibited. 1 [For Victor Neuburg see note 2 to p. 5.

We per-formed in all sixteen operations to invoke this force. It seemed at first as if our work actually increased the normal inertia. Jupite-rian phenomena which we had every right to expect simply failed to happen. Even in the matter of banqueting, which we were supposed to do lavishly in his honour, the opposition became overwhelming. Hungry as we might be, we seemed unable to force ourselves to eat even a light meal. Quite suddenly the invis-ible barrier broke down, and Jupiterian phenomena of the most unexpected kind simply rained on us. To mention one incident only: a Brother who had always been desperately poor suddenly came into a fortune, and insisted on contributing £500 to the use of the Order. I must mention one incident of the Paris Working as being of general interest, outside technical Magick. During the operation I had a bad attack of influenza, which settled down to very severe bronchitis. I was visited one evening by an old friend of mine and her young man, who very kindly and sensibly suggested that I should find relief if I smoked a few pipes of opium.1 They accordingly brought the apparatus from their apartment and we began.2 My bronchitis vanished; I went off to sleep, my guests retiring without waking me. In my sleep I dreamt; and when I woke the dream remained absolutely perfect in my conscious-ness, down to the minutest details. It was a story, a subtle expo-sure of English stupidity, set in a frame of the craziest and most fantastically gorgeous workmanship. III as I was, I jumped out of bed and wrote down the story offhand. I called it The Strate-gem.3 No doubt it was inspired by Jupiter, for it was the first short story that I had ever written that was accepted at once. 1 Uane Cheron and Walter Duranty; see p. 353, note 1, and p. 365, note 1.] 2 Opium, by the way, is sacred to Jupiter, and to Chesed, Mercy, as being sovereign against pain, and· also as enabling the soul to free itself from its gross integument and realize its majesty. 3 [First published as \"The Stratagem\" in The English Review for June 1914, and later reprinted in The Stratagem and Other Stories (1929).

All sorts of strangers planted themselves on him and he entertained them. In my own case, I became that type of Jupi-ter which we connect with the idea of prosperity, authority, and amativeness. I received numerous occult dignities; I seemed to have plenty of money without quite knowing how it happened; and I found myself exercising an almost uncanny attraction upon every woman that came into my circle of acquaintance. To me, however, as a student of nature, the one important result of this work was the proof of the efficacy of the magical method employed. Henceforth, I made it my principal study, kept a detailed record of my researches, and began to discover the rational explanation of its operation and the conditions of success. More important yet, in the deepest sense, was a feature of the result which I failed to observe at the time, and even for some years after. In veiled language are hints, unmistakable as soon as detected, that I was destined to attain the Grade of Magus, and that I was even then, by means of the Working itself, being pre-pared for the Initiation thereto.

The subtitle of the book is BIA, which is said to mean \"force.» Every drop of semen which Hermes sheds is a world.

All worlds are excreta; they represent wasted semen. Therefore all is blasphemy. This explains why man made god in his own image. The feminine side of Ma is Pan, which explains why Pan is a devil. The only way to be really born is by annihilation-to be born into Chaos, where Pan is the Saviour. I may say no more because the process is secret. With regard to Genesis: when Adami died, Heva became mas-culine, in order to escape the temptations of the serpent; but she failed. Her failure cut the serpent in two; hence the Caduceus: because if there were only one serpent, Hermes could not be the messenger of the Gods. It is the quality of this serpent business that gives him power to travel. This again is blasphemy; but law-ful, because the law of the Jews is founded upon it. It is the Fixed Mercury, of which the physical form of this god is made. This Fixed Mercury is the result of the mind. 1 [As later dialogue indicates, O.S.V. takes over the narrative at some point during this passage, but there is no indication in the TSS.] 2 [Grk., \"strength,\" \"force,\" \"might.\"]"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"Liber 415 ~ The Paris Working ~ Opus III 363 Semen itself is mercury, the river of life flowing throughout the generations.

Those are reconciled in Mercury, who is wisdom. I am making a silent prayer to the God, and thanksgiving. You can get magic force from either women or men; but to use the former is more dangerous to the career of the magician, and there is the danger of impregnation, which, however, can be guarded against in the obvious way. In order to get this God more perfectly, a cock should be slain in his honour, and the blood drunk, as a sacrament. The throat of the cock should be cut over the great image that is upon the altar; the image should be placed in a vessel so as to catch the blood. He should be invoked on eight consecutive nights, beginning with a Wednesday. He says we should feed in greater abundance; he will protect us. There is a gate to knock down between us and mastery of the Universe, and Frater L.T. has a fault, which is introspection. The point is that he is a man of thought, rather than of action. O.S.V. has also faults; his chief fault is contradic-tion. Whenever he gets into a state of hopelessness he may renew his strength by this rite; and this will be good for always. 1 The nature of this God is to go blindly ahead. The semen that he sheds is Kether, and not his own. He is only responsible for ejecting it, and he cares nothing what may come to it. He despises intensely all these correspondences, identifications, and the like. He despises intelligence, for he is the supreme wisdom, so fully in accord with destiny that interpretation is beneath him. If we need pure magical force, he is to be invoked. He says that tomorrow night we are to ask questions by Geomancy, without doing any rite. We are to invoke Juppiter on Monday. Had it not been that we first invoked him, we could not invoke Juppiter successfully. We shall probably have to invoke Juppiter for four nights t P.S.

O.S.V. was at one time a consecrated prostitute in the Temple of the Sun at Agrigentum.2 This Temple had a \"long square\" (2 x 1) outer court. In the upper square was a square Temple-with facade and pillars. O.S.v., whose name was at that time Asteris (or something similar), used to sit on the steps and receive sacrifices. I think the name was Astarte, but am afraid of having been rational. 3 The great sacrifice of Spring was to cut open a bull, and lay a virgin in the hot carcass, there to be violated by the High Priest. She was finally choked in the bull's blood (in orgasmo). Within the Temple was a circular domed shrine about 40 feet across.4 The priestesses used to carry their offerings to the Altar of Incense in the East, while the blood of the victims went to a big font in the West.5 The secret of the Temple was the midnight Sun. Globes of fire used to gather on the font, and from the other altar, and begin to revolve in the shrine. They would coalesce and then become one, which stood sin-gle and unmoving all night, only fading with dawn. Astarte sur-prised the secret, and penetrated into the shrine at the midnight sacrifice and adoration of this globe.

This death was extreme pleasure. The body was thrown out upon the court at the foot of the Temple steps, and made tabu, so that it might be \"devoured by the Sun.\" She had incurred this incarnation as the result of various mis-demeanors in Greece about a hundred years before. Her incarna-tions had always been at short intervals. It appears that in the beginning most people cannot bear frequent incarnations, and need long restorative periods of rest and peace. But superior spir-its take a great oath, and get on faster. They suffer more in pro-portion. You can recognize them by sensitiveness, which is sometimes in the painful or morbid degree. This is the case when the Great Work has been forgotten for an incarnation, or part of it; the idea is to impress the fact of the oath upon the sufferer. Astarte in her Grecian avatar had been a rather worldly priest. Her childhood was one of great misery. She had been taken by pirates and ill-treated-she came from Leghorn or its neighbour-hood. A shipwreck left her on the coast of Sicily. People found her, and finding her an expert prostitute (she was now fourteen), put her in a brothel. She hated the life. At a spring festival she was lucky enough to attract a young priest who took her, put her through a year's purification, and added her to the Temple staff. But she only saw a dull routine, though applying herself to advancement in her profession by the skill of her embraces. However, by the age of 20 or thereabouts she \"got religion,\" and began to act con amore.1 From this time she was rather the terror of the Temple. She used to do strange things, excesses, record-breaking acts, and so on. In fact she was a little mad; she had a touch of the Sun, as it were. However, she got the name of being inspired now and then, and was used in some of the public cere-monies. She made a young priest fall madly in love with her on one such occasion, and they violated their vows by carnal copu-lation of an irreligious character. In this way she made him tell her the secret of the Temple; she then killed him the same night, so that he should never betray the fact that he had betrayed the Mysteries. 1 [Ital., \" with love, enthusiastically.\" ]"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"tiber 415 ,to The Paris Working ,to Opus XlI 383 She was a slim, lean, nervous girl with a long face, a Roman nose, rather full lips, very strong from constant exercise, a habit of wriggling as if consumed by an inward itch, abundant and very wiry black hair which she sometimes dyed, very strong and very sharp and white and regular teeth, deep violet eyes, very wide apart, and set obliquely like Chinese eyes.

Half-measures were pun-ished by having their testicles removed by a special instrument on the principle of a candle-snuffer, but with a regular cup instead of a guard.

Liber 418 first appeared without commentary in The Equinox 1(5) (1911) as a bound-in special supplement. It was first published with its commentary in 1952 by Thelema Publishing Company in Hampton, New Jersey, edited by Crowley'S longtime colleague and spiritual succes-sor Karl J. Germer; see Works Cited. Germer worked from the 1930 TS (source 4 in the listing given below), but incorporated additional notes (from source 3) that had been hand-copied into the TS by Gerald J. Yorke. The Germer edition has not been relied upon as this new edition is, as was Germer's, based on primary sources. Some materials used for this edition were unavailable to Germer. A 1972 edition, edited by Israel Regardie, was issued by the Sangreal Foundation in Dallas with later re-prints. While Dr. Regardie performed an exemplary job of preparing the 1930 TS under Crowley'S supervision, his 1972 edition suffered from ed-itorial inaccuracies, and has not been used as a source for the present edition. The primary sources for this new edition are: (1) The holograph M S s: (a) the original MS of .lEthyrs 30 and 29, written in Mexico in 1900, with the quaint title \"A Booke contayninge Sundry & Divers Matters Human & Divine,\" as well as its final title \"The Vision and the Voice.\" (b) six notebooks of French manufacture (probably purchased in Algeria) containing the text of .lEthyrs 28-1 in the hand of Vic-tor Neuburg with additions, diagrams and corrections by Crowley (divided as follows: I: 28-19, II: 18-13, III:12-9, IV:8-5, V:4-2, VI: 1).

(4) Gerald Yorke's copy of the 1911 Equinox edition, with transcrip-tions of Crowley's marginal annotations from source (2) as well as his notes from a second annotated copy. (5) The typescript of Liber 418 and its commentary prepared by Crowley's secretary Israel Regardie in 1930. The sole surviving copy has no corrections by Crowley, but is unusually accurate for a typescript of a Crowley work, with only one known typographical error. This TS in-cludes figures and diagrams which are given their first publication here, as well as the \"Synopsis,\" which first appeared in the 1952 edition. The materials in (1) are at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas at Austin; (3) through (5) are in the Yorke Collection, Warburg Institute, University of London. There are other primary sources known to exist, or to have once ex-isted through old citations, but which were not directly consulted for this edition. Some of these additional sources may be identical, as a few citations are vague. These are: (a) Crowley's \"white and gold 'private copy'\" of Liber 418, which he cites in a note to the 28th 1Ethyr. This is probably a de-luxe copy of The Equinox 1(5). Yorke's transcriptions of annota-tions from such a copy survive in an annotated set of The Equinox, War burg Institute. (b) the \"Cefalu set,\" which Crowley cites in a note to the 28th 1Ethyr. This is probably a reference to a second set of The Equinox into which his annotations had been copied at Cefalu in the early 1920s; the 1952 edition adds a note \" ? by Estai,\" i.e. Jane Wolfe. (c) the MS of the first half of the commentary. This was found among Crowley's papers at his death, examined by Gerald Yorke, and sent to Karl Germer.

The typescript was prepared in 1930; the list of the Aires, synopsis, and the Call of the 30 .lEthyrs with translation were added, but the essay and historical account was not. Instead, Israel Regardie wrote a brief intro-duction that was a slight paraphrase of Crowley's Confessions. For the present edition, Crowley's own account from the Confessions serves as the introduction; this was taken from the original typescript, and re-stores three important paragraphs omitted by John Symonds and Ken-neth Grant in their 1969 abridged edition, one of which has great importance to a full understanding of Crowley's and Neuburg's magical work during the writing of Liber 418. Some of Crowley's marginal comments were not incorporated into the 1930 TS of the commentary. These were copied into the typescript by Gerald Yorke, and many of these were included by Germer in the 1952 first edition. In the present edition these are given in angled brackets < >. A few give useful variant readings that help explain nearby com-mentaries; others date from after the writing of the commentary, as shQwn by Crowley's note that \"there is an extensive commentary in typescript of this book, which can be dug out with a supreme effort and a whole lot of luck.\" Some of these notes may have been intentional omissions by Crowley.

Textual Corrections by Crowley. These corrections have been made si-lently in the text; most are from his holograph annotations (source 3), with one each from the MS (source 1) and the 1930 TS (source 5), as cited: 28th IEthyr: \"characters carved\" > \"characters, carved.\"(l). 10th IEthyr: \"misleadeth the wary\" > \"misleadeth the unwary\" (3). 10th IEthyr: \"he he himself,\" > \"he himself\" (5). 5th-4th IEthyr (transitional passage): \"pierced thee\" > \"pierced me\" (3). 2nd IEthyr: \"his word\" > \"this word\" (3). 2nd IEthyr: \"understandeth\" > \"understand\" (3). Editorial Procedures. The Equinox 1(5) text is the first edition of Liber 418 without the commentary, probably edited by Crowley and Neuburg with Equinox editor ].F.c. Fuller, whose name and address are in the front of the MS notebooks. Fuller drew the artwork for publication. This has been taken as the standard, with departures from this text noted here or in the footnotes. Neuburg's editorial habits differed from Crow-ley's, particularly with respect to English transliterations of foreign terms and names. Names such as Shiva, Pthah, etc., have been conformed to modern transliteration standards, as have Sanskrit technical terms. Quoted passages from other papers have conformed to their sources; with Class A quotations of the Holy Books, punctuation that is not a part of the source text has been left outside the quotes. Several IEthyr names had literal or transcription errors in Liber 418. These have been corrected with explanations and authorities given in footnotes to the IEthyrs concerned. The transliterations of IEthyr names have been made consistent with \"Liber 84 vel Chanokh\" and Dr. John Dee's usage in the Cotton M S S appendix, with the v used instead of u. The Algerian place-names are given in their modern forms. Liber 418 is in A:.A:. Class AB, not Class A. Class AS is a special \"mixed\" literary classification denoting a mixture of revealed material with that of \" ordinary scholarship.\" The custom of verbatim publication of Class A material was not followed in every instance, as the M S shows that the Class A and B material is practically inseparable; all of the text was edited by Crowley before publication.

The \"Synopsis,\" from the 1930 TS, was first published in the 1952 edition. Gerald Yorke later copied additional notes into the TS, taken from a MS notebook that was in the possession of the New York book and manuscript dealer Philip Kaplan, c. 1958; the present location of this notebook is unknown. Yorke notes that \"they were in A.C.'s hand, but the page was scratched out.\" In the present edition these notes are given in angled brackets < >, and the \"Synopsis\" is given in tabular format with the earlier \"Comment on the Nature of the IEthyrs.\" The MS of this \"Comment\" (source l(c) above) has variant capitalization from The Equinox version, adopted in some cases for consistency.

Minor errors in the Enochian transliteration have been corrected for publication in this new edition. Liber 325 The Bartzabel Working For its first publication in this number of The Equinox, this paper has been formally titled \"Liber 325\" (the numeration of the name Bartza-bel), and placed in A:.A:. Class C. The ritual that forms its basis, \"An Evocation of Bartzabel the Spirit of Mars,\" was published in The Equi-nox 1(9) (1913), p. 117. The MS of the ritual is preserved in a notebook at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, the University of Texas at Austin. This notebook includes the spirit's responses to the questions of the Charge. Bartzabel's replies were written in extreme haste, at dictation speed; the hand is not that of Crowley or Neuburg, but is possibly that of Leila Waddell. For publication, abbreviations have been expanded and missing punctuation supplied; doubtful readings are given in brackets. The ritual has been made to conform to the M S in or-der to reproduce faithfully its original performance. Some ritual instruc-tions and several diagrams only appear in the MS; there are also instances of variant wording. Some diagrams illustrating practical details have been taken from Crowley's sources, as cited. The opening titling, summary and Latin phrase are not in the MS; other material not in MS, but in The Equinox, is noted. The Equinox version had two misreadings of the MS (\"grey\" for \"fiery\" and \"enclose\" for \"unloose\").

Section headings that do not appear in The Equinox have been added for clarity. Crowley's brief account of this working in his Confessions has been added as an introduction. Liber 60 The Ab-ul-Diz Working For its first publication in this number of The Equinox, this paper has been formally titled \"Liber 60\" (a numeration of the name Ab-ul-Diz), and placed in A:.A:. Class C. This paper survives in a TS believed to date from c. 1918 that was sent to Gerald J. Yorke by Charles Stansfeld Jones in 1949; the original MS is presumed lost. This typescript was ap-parently later borrowed by John Symonds, presumably for his biography of Aleister Crowley, The Great Beast (1951). John Symonds and Kenneth Grant planned to include this paper in The Paris and Amalantrah Work-ings, announced by 93 Publishing in 1974 but never issued. This TS is now in the O.T. O . Archives. Many entries in this typescript-particularly the responses of Ab-ul-Diz-are extremely cryptic. These have been reproduced as faithfully as possible. Some parenthetical remarks have been moved to footnotes, and explanatory glosses in parentheses have been italicized for clarity. Crowley's account of this working in his Confessions has been added as an introduction. For clarity, each daily session of the working has been given a subhead for this edition. Figures missing in the typescript have been provided for publication wherever possible. Liber 415 The Paris Working \"The Paris Working\" is an unusual paper in that it is integral to the cur-ricula of both A:.A:. and O.T.O. The original MS of this working is be-lieved lost. The paper as published here was taken from four surviving sources: (1) A T S of the main working and the\" Esoteric Record,\" prepared by John Symonds and Kenneth Grant for the abortive 93 Publishing edition of The Paris and Amalantrah Workings (ibid.); this TS is now in the O.T.O. Archives. This typescript lacks the \"Grimorium Sanctissimum\" and \"The Holy Hymns to the Great Gods of Heaven.\" This TS is gener-ally unreliable by comparison with (2) and (3). (2) A modern transcript of a TS at the Warburg Institute, University of London; the Warburg TS has been missing from that collection since"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"Editorial Notes 429 at least 1986 E. v. The transcript was prepared c. 1980 for Marcelo Motta (Frater <Il). This typescript lacks the \"Summary,\" \"Grimorium Sanctissimum,\" and \"The Holy Hymns to the Great Gods of Heaven.\" It is the most accurate surviving source for the main working. (3) An original TS of the \"Esoteric Record,\" \"Summary,\" \"Grimori-urn Sanctissimum,\" and \"The Holy Hymns to the Great Gods of Heav-en\" at the George Arents Research Library, Syracuse University. This TS includes two versions of the \"Summary\" of differing lengths; the longer version is included here. The Syracuse TS is believed to have once be-longed to Leah Hirsig (Soror Alostrael), and probably dates from c. 1915. (4) A MS notebook dating from c. 1913-1915 in which Crowley composed many of \"The Holy Hymns to the Great Gods of Heaven.\" This notebook was the source of most of Crowley's English versions of these hymns. The Latin readings, and the order of the hymns, differ in this MS from those given in the later Syracuse TS. Formerly the property of Jeanne Robert Foster (Soror Hilarion), this notebook is now at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas at Austin. The discussion of Christ as Mercury was also checked against Crow-ley's Confessions and The Book of Thoth, where it is quoted at length. The \"Grimorium Sanctissimum\" appears in a slightly different form in Book rv, Part III (Magick in Theory and Practice) (1929), Appendix VI. As this paper is integral to \"The Paris Working,\" the Syracuse TS has been followed. The \"Ritual Ordained for Public Service,\" given in full in a note, has been taken from the M s at the George Arents Research Library, Syracuse University. The workings are not consistently dated, so dates have been provided in the text where necessary. The \"Esoteric Record\"--originally a sepa-rate document-has been interpolated into the main text of the Work-ings for continuity. The TSS of the main workings give each as \"The First Working,\" etc., while Crowley's citation style is \"Opus I,\" etc.; both forms are employed in the headings for this edition. This paper is described in its titling as \"Document C in the account of the progress of NEMO to TO MErA ElHPION .\" At this writing, only this paper, and a portion of \"Liber 73, The Urn\" (designated as Document F), have been identified as pertaining to this series. Crowley's account of this working in his Confessions has been added as an introduction. As the original M S is lost, it has been impossible to supply figures and illustrations referred to in the text."},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"430 THE EQUINOX Appendix I Algerian Diary, 1909 E.

Templi Orientis, the Order of Oriental Templars, or Order of the Temple of the East. The O.T.O. is dedicated to securing the Liberty of the Individual, and his or her advancement in Light, Wisdom, Understanding, Knowledge, and Power. This is accomplished through Beauty, Courage, and Wit, on the Foundation of Universal Brotherhood. The O.T.O. is in sympathy with the traditional ideals of Freema-sonry, and was the first of the Old JEon orders to accept The Book of the Law. Many aspirants to the Great Work have a genuine need for information, guidance, fellowship, or the opportunity to assist their fellow aspirants and serve humanity. Such aspirants will find welcome in O.T.O. The structure of the O.T.O., like that of Freemasonry and the ancient mystery schools, is based on a graded series of initia-tions, or Degrees. In these Degrees, the O.T.O. seeks to instruct the individual by allegory and symbol in the profound mysteries of Existence, and thereby to assist each to discover his or her own true Nature. Every man and woman of full age, free, and of good report, has an indefeasible right to the introductory Degrees of the O.T.O. The O.T.O. also includes the Gnostic Catholic Church (Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica), whose central public and private rite is \"Liber xv,\" the Gnostic Mass. The O.T.O. has active branches around the world, and issues numerous periodicals in many languages. In addition to the official O.T.O. instructions and the celebration of the Gnostic Mass, many national and regional O.T.O. Lodges, Oases and Camps offer classes and study programs to their members.

Liber 418, The Vision and the Voice is the record of Aleister Crowley's exploration of the 30 JEthyrs of the Enochian system of magick developed by the Elizabethan magicians Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelly. Crowley obtained these visions in Mexico in 1900, and in Algeria in 1909. They are the source of many key spiritual doctrines of Thelema, particularly concerning the theogony of the All-Father Chaos and the goddess Babalon. They give an account of the tran-scendence of the Ego by crossing the Abyss, and the attainment of the grade of Master of the Temple. This new edition adds previously unpublished material, including new explana. tory diagrams, illustrations designed by Crowley, and the actual Algerian diary record. Unlike other available editions of The Vision and the Voice, this volume includes Crowley's extensive and illuminating commentary. This collection features several works that complement The Vision and the Voice, giving details of Crowley's other advanced initiations and magical workings. Liber 325, The Bartzabel Working, gives ritual instructions for the evocation of the Spirit of Mars, and includes the first publication of the actual record of the group ritual evocation of this spirit conducted by Crowley in 1910. Liber 60, The Ab-ul-Diz Working, gives an account of the astral communications with an Adept named Ab-ul-Diz in 1911 that led to the writing of Crowley's Book 4. Liber 415, The Paris Working, is the record of a series of sex-magical workings conducted in 1914, designed to restore the worship of several of the gods of pagan antiquity. It includes The Holy Hymns to the Great Gods of Heaven. This book collects the diaries of Aleister Crowley for 1909-1914 into one volume. ISBN I 780877"}]
