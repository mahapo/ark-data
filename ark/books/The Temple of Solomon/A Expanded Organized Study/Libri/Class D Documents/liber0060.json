Thecurrent of my life was once more to be suddenly turned; and as usual, thiscritical change came about as the result of a series of casual chances. I wascaught in a web, some of whose strands had been woven as early as 1902.That fertile passage trough Paris on my return from Chogo Ri, which hadalready born so much fruit in my life, had still some seed—which now cameto harvest.I have mentioned Nina Olivier, whom I loved so well and sans sopassionately. In my sunlight she had blossomed into La Dame deMontparno, the Queen of the Quarter. But I have not mentioned an obscureprig whom I will call Monet-Knott, whom I had met though my fiancee, the\"Star\" to Nina's \"Garter.\" This brainless and conceited youth had becomeaccompanist to the greatest dancer of her generation. Let me call herLavinia King. She, first and never equalled, had understood anddemonstrated the Art of dancing as a complete language of affections of themind and heart. Knott and Nina [...] had contracted a liaison. I met Knottfor the second time [and] I saw a fair amount of him in the next fewweeks; so that, running across him in London on october 11th, he took meafter supper to the Savoy to meet Miss King.A boisterous party was in progress. The dancer's lifelong friend, whom Iwill call by the name she afterwards adopted, Soror Virakam, wascelebrating her birthday. This lady, a magnificent specimen of mingledIrish and Italian blood, posessed most powerful personality and a terrificmagnetism which instantly attracted my own. I forgot everything. I sat onthe floor like a Chinese God, exchanging electricity with her.After some weeks' preliminary skirmishing, we joined battle along thewhole front; that is to say, I crossed to Paris, where she had a flat, andcarried her off to Switzerland to spend the winter skating. Arrived at"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Interlaken, we found that Murren was not open, so we went on to St.Moritz, breaking the journey at Zurich. This town is so hideous anddepressing that we felt that our only chance of living through the night wasto get superbly drunk, which we did...(Let me emphasize that this wild adventure had not the remotestconnection with Magick. Virakam was utterly ignorant of the subject. Shehad hardly so much as a smattering of Christian Science. She had neveratteneded a seance, or played Planchette.)...Lasatti sed non satiati by midnight. I expected to sleep, but wasaroused by Virakam being apparently seized by a violent attack of hysteria,in which she poured forth a frantic torrent of senseless hallucination. I wasirritated and tried to calm her. But she insisted that her experience was real;that she bore and important message to me from some invisible individual.Such nonsense increased my irritation. But—after about an hour of it—myjaw fell with astonishment. I became suddenly aware of a coherence in herravings, and further that they were couched in my own language ofsymbols. My attention being thus awakened, I listened to what she wassaying. A few minutes convinced me that she was actually incommunication with some intelligence who had a message for me.Let me briefly explain the grounds for this belief. I have already setforth, in connection with the Cairo working, some of the safeguards which Ihabitually employ. Virakam's vision contained elements perfectly familiarto me. This was clear proof that the man in her vision, whom she calledAb-ul-Diz, was acquainted with my system of hieroglyphics, literal andnumerical, and also with some incidents in my magical career. Virakamherself certainly knew nothing of any of these. Ab-ul-Diz told us to callhim a week later, when he would give further information. We arrived at StMoritz and engaged a suite in the Palace Hotel.My first surprise was to find that I had brought with me exactly thoseMagical Weapons which were suitable for the work proposed and noothers. But a yet more startling circumstance was to come. For the purposesof the Cairo working, Ouarda and I had brought two abbai; one, scarlet, forme; one, blue, for her. I had brought mine to St Moritz; the other was ofcourse in the possession of Ouarda. Imagine my amazement when Virakamproduced from her trunk a blue abbai so like Ouarda's that the onlydifferences were minute details of gold embroidery! The suggestion wasthat the Secret Chiefs, having chosen Ouarda as their messenger, could notuse anyone else until she had become irrevocably disqualified by insanity.Not till now could her place be taken by another; and that Virakam should"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"possess a duplicate of her Magical Robe seemed a strong argument that shehad been consecrated by them to take the place of her unhappy predecessor.She was very unsatisfactory as a clairvoyant; she resented theseprecautions. She was a quick-tempered and impulsive woman, alwayseager to act with reckless enthusiasm. My cold scepticism no doubtprevented her from doing her best. Ab-ul-Diz himself constantly demandedthat I should show \"faith\" and warned me that I was wrecking my chancesby my attitude. I prevailed upon him, however, to give adequate proof ofhis existence and his claim to speak with authority. The main purport of hismessage was to instruct me to write a book on my system of mysticism andMagick, to be called Book Four, and told me that by means of this book, Ishould prevail against public neglect. It saw no objection to writing such abook; on quite rational grounds, it was a proper course of action, I thereforeagreed to do so. But Ab-ul-Diz was determined to dictate the conditions inwhich the book should be written; and this was a difficult matter. Hewanted us to travel to an appropriate place. On this point I was not whollysatisfied with the result of my cross-examination. I know now that I wasmuch to blame throughout. I was not honest either with him, myself orVirakam. I allowed material considerations to influence me, and I clung—oh triple fool!—to my sentimental obligations towards Laylah.We finally decided to do what he asked, though part of my objectionwas founded on his refusal to give us absolutely definite instructions.However, we crossed the passes in a sleigh to Chiavenna, whence we tookthe train to Milan. In this city we had a final conversation with Ab-ul-Diz. Ihad exhausted his patience, as he mine, and he told us that he would notvisit us any more. He gave us his final instructions. We were to go to Romeand beyond Rome, though he refused to name the exact spot. We were totake a villa and there write Book Four. I asked him how we mightrecognize the right villa. I forget what answer he gave through her, but forthe first time he flashed a message directly into my own consciousness.\"You will recognize it beyond the possibility of doubt or error,\" he told me.With this, a picture came into my mind of a hillside on which were a houseand garden marked by two tall Persian nuts.The next day we went on to Rome. Owing to my own Ananias-likeattempt to \"keep back part of the price\", my relations with Virakam hadbecome strained. We reached Naples after two or three quarrelsome days inRome and began house-hunting. I imagined that we should find dozens ofsuitable places to choose from, but we spend day after day scouring the cityand suburbs in an automobile, without finding a single place to let thatcorresponded in the smallest degree with our ideas."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Virakam's brat—a most god-forsaken lout—was to join us for theChristmas holidays, and on the day he was due to arrive we motored out asa forlorn hope to Posilippo before meeting him at the station at four o'clockor thereabouts. But the previous night Virakam had a dream in which shesaw the desired villa with absolute clearness. (I had been careful to saynothing to her about the Persian nuts, so as to have a weapon against her incase she insisted that such and such a place was the one intended.)After a fruitless search we turned our automobile towards Naples, alongthe crest of Posilippo. At one point there is a small side lane scarcelynegotiable by motor, and indeed hardly perceptible, as it branches from themain road so as to form an acute-angled \"Y\" with the foot towards Naples.But Virakam sprang excitedly to her feet and told the chauffeur to drivedown it. I was astonished, she being hysterically anxious to meet the train,and our time being already almost too short. But she swore passionatelythat the villa was down that lane. The road became constantly rougher andnarrower. After some time, it came out on the open slope; a low stoneparapet on the left protecting it. Again she sprang to her feet. “There”, shecried, pointing with her finger, “is the villa I saw in my dream!” I looked.No villa was visible. I said so. She had to agree; yet stuck to her point thatshe saw it. I subsequently returned to that spot and found that a shortsection of wall, perhaps fifteen feet of narrow edge of masonry, is justperceptible through a gap in the vegetation. We drove on; we came to a tiny piazza, on one side of which was achurch. “That is the square and the church”, she exclaimed, “that I saw inmy dream!”We drove on. The lane became narrower, rougher and steeper. Littlemore than a hundred yards ahead it was completely “up”, blocked withheaps of broken stone. The chauffeur protested that he would be ableneither to turn the car nor to back it up to the square. Virakam, in a violentrage, insisted on proceeding. I shrugged my shoulders. I had gotaccustomed to these typhoons.We drove on a few yards. Then the chauffeur made up his mind torevolt and stopped the car. On the left was a wide open gate through whichwe could see a gang of workmen engaged in pretending to repair aramshackle villa. Virakam called the foreman and asked in broken Italian ifthe place was to let. He told her no; it was under repair. With crazyconfidence she dragged him within and forced him to show her over thehouse. I sat in resigned disgust, not deigning to follow. Then my eyessuddenly saw down the garden, two trees close together. I stooped. Their"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"tops appeared. They were Persian nuts! The stupid coincidence angered me,and yet some irresistible instinct compelled me to take out my notebookand pencil and jot down the name written over the gate—Villa Caldarazzo.Idly, I added up the letters 6 + 10 + 30 + 30 + 1 and 20 + 1 + 30 + 4 + 1 +200 + 1 + 7 + 7 + 70. Their sum struck me like a bullet in my brain. It was418, the number of the Magical Formula of the Aeon, a numericalhieroglyph of the Great Work! Ab-ul-Diz had made no mistake. Myrecognition of the right place was not to depend on a mere matter of trees,which might be found almost anywhere. Recognition beyond all possibilityof doubt was what he promised. He had been as good as his word.I was entirely overwhelmed. I jumped out of the car and ran up to thehouse. I found Virakam in the main room. The instant I entered Iunderstood that it was entirely suited for a Temple. The walls weredecorated with crude frescoes which somehow suggested the exactatmosphere proper to the Work. The very shape of the room seemedsomehow significant. Further, it seemed as if it were filled with a peculiaremanation. This impression must not be dismissed as sheer fancy. Few menbut are sufficiently sensitive to distinguish the spiritual aura of certainbuildings. It is impossible not to feel reverence in certain cathedrals andtemples. The most ordinary dwelling-houses often possess an atmosphereof their own; some depress, some cheer; some disgust, others strike chill tothe heart.Virakam of course was entirely certain that this was the villa for us.Against this was the positive statement of the people in charge that it wasnot to be let. We refused to accept this assertion. We took the name andaddress of the owner, dug him out, and found him willing to give usimmediate possession at a small rent. We went in on the following day andsettled down almost at once to consecrate the Temple and begin the book.The idea was a follows. I was to dictate; Virakam to transcribe, and if atany point there appeared the slightest obscurity—obscurity from the point ofview of the entirely ignorant and not particularly intelligent reader; in aword, the average lower-class man in the street—I was to recast mythoughts in plainer language. By this means we hoped to write a book wellwithin the compass of the understanding of even the simplest- mindedseeker after spiritual enlightenment.Part One of Book Four expounds the principles and practice ofmysticism in simple scientific terms stripped of all sectarian accretion,superstitious enthusiasms or other extraneous matter. It proved completelysuccessful in this sense."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Part Two deals with the principles and practice of Magick. I explainedthe real meaning and modus operandi of all the apparatus and technique ofMagick. Here, however, I partially failed. I was stupid enough to assumethat my readers were already acquainted with the chief classics of Magick. Iconsequently described each Weapon, explained it and gave instructions forits use, without making it clear why it should be necessary at all. Part Twois therefore an wholly admirable treatise only for one who has alreadymastered the groundwork and gained some experience of the practice of theart.The number 4 being the formula of the book, it was of course to consistof four parts. I carried out this idea by expressing the nature of the Tetrad,not only by the name and plan of the book, but by issuing it in the shape ofa square 4 inches by 4, and pricing each part as a function of 4. Part Onewas published at 4 groats, Part Two at 4 tanners, Part Three was to cost 3\"Lloyd George groats\" (at this time the demagogue was offering theworkman ninepence for fourpence, by means of an insurance swindleintended to enslave him more completely than ever). Part Four, 4 shillings.Part Three was to deal with the practice of Magick, and Part Four, of TheBook of the Law with its history and the Comment; the volume, in factindicated in the Book itself, chapter III, verse 39.The programme was cut short. The secret contest between the will ofVirakam and my own broke into open hostility. A serious quarrel led to herdashing off to Paris. She repented almost before she arrived andtelegraphed me to rejoin her, which I did, and we went together to London.There, however, an intrigue resulted in her hastily marrying a Turkishadventurer who proceeded to beat her and, a little later, to desert her. Herhysteria became chronic and uncontrollable; she took to furious bouts ofdrinking which culminated in delirium tremens.The partial failure of our partnership was to some extent, without doubt,my own fault. I was not whole-hearted and I refused to live by faith ratherthan by sight. I cannot reproach myself for this; for that, I have no excuse. Imay nevertheless express a doubt as to whether full success was in any casepossible. Her own masterless passions could hardly have allowed her topass unscathed through the ordeals which are always imposed upon thosewho undertake tasks of this importance."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"LIBER LXThe Ab-ul-Diz WorkingAn ACCOUNT of a Communication made to Fra.

P. was of course ignorant at the time;but he was in wise ignorant of the profound and occult emotion caused bythe meeting, an emotion which was not peculiar to himself alone.On the 13th he took tea with the lady, and returning after dinner, did notleave the suite until he had expressed (however unworthily) the nature ofhis feelings. On the 14th he dined with her, and after partakingsubsequently of chocolate and rolls, left for the North of England.He returned to the Savoy Hotel on the 29th, somewhat disturbed in hismind by the silence with which his letters to her had been treated, but,meeting her, forgave her, and passed several hours in her company, theparting being dictated by her being obliged to take the 11 o'clock train toParis, on the morning of the 30th.He rejoined at lunchtime on the 14th of November at her flat in Paris,took her to Montparnasse on the night of the 18th and left Paris with her forSwitzerland on the evening of the 19th.The night of the 21st was spent at the National Hotel, Zurich.At about midnight she was in a state of excitement, exhaustion, andhysteria so fierce and terrible as to be almost alarming to Fra. P. I mustmention that he had hitherto regarded her only as a voluptuous and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"passionate woman of the world, or perhaps in part as a fellow-artist; nothought of her use in his occult work had ever crossed his mind.However, the state described, one little removed from that of anamorous but infuriated lioness, suddenly and without warning gave place toa profound calm hardly distinguishable from prophetic trance, and shebegan to describe what she was “seeing”.Fra. P.'s old sceptical attitude had in no wise been weakened by thelapse of years; he attached no importance to, or interest (save artisticinterest) in, what he regarded as a morbid phenomenon due to over-excitement of Bacchus and Eros, and he cannot particularize the order ofthe events now to be related, although he wrote them down an hour laterwhen they assumed an occult importance.The lady had, I think, on the previous day (the 20th) “seen” in a dreamthe “head of the 5 White Brothers” who told her that “it was all right.”This person now again appeared to her. He was an old man with a longwhite beard; in his hand he held a wand, and on his breast was a large“claw”. On his finger was a ring; under a transparent “glass” top it had awhite feather or “bird”. Subsequently she described this as the feather of a“bird of Paradise”, or something similar.His first counsel to the seer was “to make herself perfectly passive” inorder that he might communicate freely.She then said that the 5 White Brethren were “turning red” and “Here isa book to be given to Fra. P.1 The name of the book is Aba, and its numberIV.” It was the correspondence of the name and number that made Fra. P.think there might be something in the communication.2In the room seen was also a black-headed “Turk” or “Egyptian” wearinga tarbush and a red sash; his name is “Jezel”3 (?) and he has one handcovered with crocodile skin. He is hunting this book; but (said the Ancient)Fra. P. will get it.There was a lot, too, about the Book VII; curious in view of the fact thatthe words (“[Liber] VII.” V:46) “only by passive love shall he avail” hadsprung up in P.'s mind when she mentioned the old man's first command.P. then began to “challenge” the old man.The seer was not seeing clearly, and was terribly afraid of the wholebusiness.He gave his name as (?) Ab-ul-Diz.1 She did not know Fra. P. as such. This is not a “test”.2 ABA =  = 43 Jezel =  = 5; Veli =  = 57. This suggests a possible identity between the“Turk” in the vision and the actual Turk who ultimately spoilt the work, Veli Bey;but I do not like the spelling, and Soror Virakam, on meeting Veli Bey's father,Elias Pasha, recognized him immediately as Jezel."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"P. asked “What about 78?” and he replied that he was 78.1P. asked “What is 65?”'2 He said that P. was 65 and his age 1400.3At some point or other he gave his symbol: IV 1400 78 1. “Water springproceeding hence.”I gave the P[ass] W[ord] of the Equinox (Κ[ραροτα]) at which hefrowned.P. considered, and considers, these attempts at identification as entirelyunsatisfactory.He promised to come and “make all clear” after 7 days at ll P.M., P.being told to invoke “as before.”4 It is curious that this new revelationshould have come at the moment when “Liber Legis” was ready to bepublished;5 and the proofs of the Horus invocation arrived on the verymorning of the day when the invocation is to be made. P. will test this asfollows: he will begin invoking by the “Bornless One” and if the seer getsnothing from this, and then does get something from \"Horus\", then——good.At St. Moritz P. had the following documents:1. θελημα2.
