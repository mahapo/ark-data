Then is light married with light, and the child oftheir love is that other darkness, wherein they abide that have lost name and form. Therefore did I kindle him that had notunderstanding, and in the Book of the Law did I write the secrets of truth that are like unto a star and a snake and a sword.00. And unto him that understandeth at last do I deliver the secrets of truth in such wise that the least of the little childrenof the light may run to the knees of the mother and be brought to understand.0. And thus shall he do who will attain unto the mystery of the knowledge and conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel:1. First, let him prepare a chamber, of which the walls and the roof shall be white, and the floor shall be covered with acarpet of black squares and white, and the border thereof shall be blue and gold.2. And if it be in a town, the room shall have no window, and if it be in the country, then it is better if the window be in theroof. Or, if it be possible, let this invocation be performed in a temple prepared for the ritual of passing through the Tuat.3. From the roof he shall hang a lamp, wherein is a red glass, to burn olive oil. And this lamp shall he cleanse and makeready after the prayer of sunset, and beneath the lamp shall be an altar, foursquare, and the height shall be thrice half of thebreadth or double the breadth.4. And upon the altar shall be a censer, hemispherical, supported upon three legs, of silver, and within it an hemisphere ofcopper, and upon the top a grating of gilded silver, and thereupon shall he burn incense made of four parts of olibanum andtwo parts of stacte, and one part of lignum aloes, or of cedar, or of sandal. And this is enough.5. And he shall also keep ready in a flask of crystal within the altar, holy anointing oil made of myrrh and cinnamon andgalangal.6. And even if he be of higher rank than a Probationer, he shall yet wear the robe of the Probationer, for the star of flameshoweth forth Ra Hoor Khuit openly upon the breast, and secretly the blue triangle that descendeth is Nuit, and the redtriangle that ascendeth is Hadit. And I am the golden Tau in the midst of their marriage. Also, if he choose, he mayinstead wear a close-fitting robe of shot silk, purple and green, and upon it a cloak without sleeves, of bright blue, coveredwith golden sequins, and scarlet within.7. And he shall make himself a wand of almond wood or of hazel cut by his own hands at dawn at the Equinox, or at theSolstice, or on the day of Corpus Christi, or on one of the feast-days that are appointed in the Book of the Law.8. And he shall engrave with his own hand upon a plate of gold the Holy Sevenfold Table, or the Holy Twelvefold Table,or some particular device. And it shall be foursquare within a circle, and the circle shall be winged, and he shall attach itabout his forehead by a ribbon of blue silk.9. Moreover, he shall wear a fillet of laurel or rose or ivy or rue, and every day, after the prayer of sunrise, he shall burn itin the fire of the censer.10. Now he shall pray thrice daily, about sunset, and at midnight, and at sunrise. And if he be able, he shall pray also fourtimes between sunrise and sunset.11. The prayer shall last for the space of an hour, at the least, and he shall seek ever to extend it, and to inflame himself inpraying. Thus shall he invoke his Holy Guardian Angel for eleven weeks, and in any case he shall pray seven times dailyduring the last week of the eleven weeks."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"12. And during all this time he shall have composed an invocation suitable, with such wisdom and understanding as maybe given him from the Crown, and this shall he write in letters of gold upon the top of the altar.13. For the top of the altar shall be of white wood, well polished, and in the centre thereof he shall have placed a triangle ofoak-wood, painted with scarlet, and upon this triangle the three legs of the censer shall stand.14. Moreover, he shall copy his invocation upon a sheet of pure white vellum, with Indian ink, and he shall illuminate itaccording to his fancy and imagination, that shall be informed by beauty.15. And on the first day of the twelfth week he shall enter the chamber at sunrise, and he shall make his prayer, having firstburnt the conjuration that he had made upon the vellum in the fire of the lamp.16. Then, at his prayer, shall the chamber be filled with a light insufferable for splendour, and a perfume intolerable forsweetness. And his Holy Guardian Angel shall appear unto him, yea, his Holy Guardian Angel shall appear unto him, sothat he shall be rapt away into the Mystery of Holiness.17. All that day shall he remain in the enjoyment of the knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.18. And for three days after he shall remain from sunrise unto sunset in the temple, and he shall obey the counsel that hisAngel shall have given unto him, and he shall suffer those things that are appointed.19. And for ten days thereafter shall he withdraw himself as shall have been taught unto him from the fullness of thatcommunion, for he must harmonize the world that is within with the world that is without.20. And at the end of the ninety-one days he shall return into the world, and there shall he perform that work to which theAngel shall have appointed him.21. And more than this it is not necessary to say, for his Angel shall have entreated him kindly, and showed him in whatmanner he may be most perfectly invoked. And unto him that hath this Master there is nothing else that he needeth, solong as he continue in the knowledge and conversation of the Angel, so that he shall come at last into the City of thePyramids.22. Lo! two and twenty are the paths of the Tree, but one is the Serpent of Wisdom; ten are the ineffable emanations, butone is the Flaming Sword.Behold! There is an end to life and death, an end to the thrusting forth and the withdrawing of the breath.Yea, the House of the Father is a mighty tomb, and in it he hath buried everything whereof ye know."}]
