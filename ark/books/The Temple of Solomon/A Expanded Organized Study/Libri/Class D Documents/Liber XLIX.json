[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Liber XLIX Shi Yi Chien Being an account of the divine perfection illustrated by the seven-fold permutation of the Dyad. The symbol system of solid and broken lines that comprise the Yi Jing was created before the more complicated symbols that carry the Chinese language. There are 64 Hexagrams, 128 Trigrams and the 384 lines to carry information correlated to what may be called the Aethyric formation of the Universe. The educational work contained herein focuses on building a body of light from the Aethyr and then applying this knowledge to the Magnum Opus. Commanding the Aethyr is essential in the work of transmuting consciousness. For once we have formulated the Body of Light and the Aethyr, we may then apply the Hexagrams and especially the Trigrams (as suggested by the triadic nature of the cadeucus; also the two strands of DNA and their dynamic relation with RNA) in a scientific manner. The Hexagrams especially are also correlated to the paths of The Qabalistic Tree Of Life and the Holy Tarot. The comparison with genome coding is uncanny. Theme Hexagram - 49th I Ching Hexagram, Ger Each I Ching Hexagram has an attribution in the Daoist system like the letters of the Hebrew alphabet are attributed to the Tree-of-Life. The 49th Hexagram Ger is not particularly more significant than the other Hexagrams. It‟s value is synchronistic for the Thelemic Qabalah as it is the number of Babalon (7 x 7). It‟s title more aptly describes the nature of the Aeon of Horus as nothing short of a spiritual revolution whose aim is to bring humanity to that spiritual consciousness that will usher in the Aeon of Aquarius. We begin this process through a conscious intention take on the Great Work. Herein the 49th Hexagram, Ger has been designated with the title of Spiritual Revolution. The Chinese character we enunciate as Ger in ancient times included the meaning of molting. We could use the example of the molting of a lizard‟s skin as it grows. A lizard discards its old skin or patterns as it grows. The two Trigrams that compose the 49th Hexagram are Fire and Water, the former suggesting the nature of the Aeon of Horus and the latter suggesting the Aethyr (i.e. the waters separated in Genesis). There gematric value of 340, reduces to 7. Shin-Mem spell the Hebrew word that translates as „The Name,‟ suggesting the Logos. The Construction Of The Tai Chi And 64 Hexagrams In Taoist alchemy the Wu Chi (void) births the Tai Chi (manifested universe). All is in the Tao. The movements of the Tai Chi are correlated to the changing lines of the 64 I Ching Hexagrams. Each Hexagram has six lines. The lines are either solid Yang lines, broken Ying lines or usually a combination of the two. Yang and Ying symbolize the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"polarity in the Tao. Each Hexagram is made of two Trigrams, composed of three lines. A close study of the Trigrams and the Hexagrams will reveal basic images, such as fire boiling water as in Ger the 49th Hexagram. This description is quite apt in revealing the nature of the Aeon of Horus. It is the adjustment1 period that is correcting the interference of the Black Brothers in the Aeon of Pisces as we prepare for the Aeon of Aquarius. The Universe could be defined as a limitless Aethyric ocean varying in vibration, collectively revealing the essence of the Monad. Astro-physics has shown us the totality of this as it has connected with the ancient Astrology and what is now known as the Starry Gnosis. In terms of holographic theory, the evolutionary process of the Universe is showing the intelligent design of the Monad. The Holy Qabalah shows lines of causality stretching back to the beginning of this universe and beyond, into an endless synergistic system. Consciousness is an evolutionary development. A sub-section of this is the law of tempering. Consciousness is tempered or refined through countervailing antiquated vibratory patterns with ones of a higher frequency. The slower ones are tempered and gradually replaced by their higher octave. This becomes more apparent as we study the outer and more recently discovered planets. Uranus becomes the higher arc of Mercury as Neptune becomes the higher arc of Venus, and Pluto, the higher arc of Mars. Another sub section of this is the Law of Meditation. It states that consciousness is upgraded by restructuring sub-consciousness by means of active meditations. Spiritual correctness is a moral law of integrity. Once one engages the karma of Oaths connected with the Great Work, and is active in conscious evolutionary development one gradually transmutes the nature of one‟s separateness by discovering our Aethyric interconnectedness. We are seen as one in the light of the Monad, validating the formula given in AL I.45: The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none! People are integrative parts of larger and larger segments of the Monad. We could begin with the atoms that form the cells within our bodies. Then move on to the larger whole of the web of life on earth that we are a part of. Earth is an integral part of this solar system. Our solar system is part of this galaxy, which is a living cell in the universal body of the Monad.   1 The Adjustment Atu has Venus attributed, and so again, risking a little bit of a stretch, we have a recursion of 7 on a Sephirotic level.

It seems to me as though Vedic divination and Tai Shuan Ching are based on the Triality aspect of the 256-dimensional Cl(8) Clifford algebra of IFA, while I Ching is based on the 64-dimensional Cl(6) Clifford subalgebra of the Cl(8) of IFA. When the 8 trigrams are combined in pairs according to the Fu Xi Earlier Heaven Ho Tu arrangement to make 64 hexagrams of the I Ching, you get a very symmetrical I Ching pattern Although the Earlier Heaven arrangement of the 8 trigrams does not exactly correspond to the binary number sequence from 0 through 7 (it is 0,1,2,3,7,6,5,4 instead of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7), the Earlier Heaven arrangement of the 64 hexagrams does correspond to the binary number sequence from 0 through 63. According to two 13 February 2001 articles in The New York Times by Nicholas Wade: \"... Dr. J. Craig Venter and colleagues at Celera Genomics report in ...[ Science 291 (16 February 2001) 1304-1351 ]... that they have identified 26,588 human genes for sure, with another 12,731 candidate genes. ... Celera's rival, the publicly funded consortium of academic centers, has come to a similar conclusion. Its report in ...[ Nature 409 (15 February 2001) 860-921, where they say \"... Genes (or at least their coding regions) comprise only a tiny fraction of human DNA, but they represent the major biological function of the genome and the main focus of interest by biologists. ....\" ]... pegs the probable number of human genes at 30,000 to 40,000. Because the current gene-finding methods tend to overpredict, each side prefers the lower end of its range, and 30,000 seems to be the new favorite estimate. ... Most of the repetitive DNA sequences in the 75 percent of the genome that is essentially junk ceased to accumulate millions of years ago, but a few of sequences are still active and may do some good. The chromosomes"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"themselves have a rich archaeology. Large blocks of genes seem to have been extensively copied from one human chromosome to another, beckoning genetic archaeologists to figure out the order in which the copying occurred and thus to reconstruct the history of the animal genome. As the modest number of human genes became apparent, biologists in both teams were forced to think how to account for the greater complexity of people, given that they seem to possess only 50 percent more genes than the roundworm. It is not foolish pride to suppose there is something more to Homo sapiens than Caenorhabditis elegans. The roundworm is a little tube of a creature with a body of 959 cells, of which 302 are neurons in what passes for its brain. Humans have 100 trillion cells in their body, including 100 billion brain cells. Several explanations are emerging for how to generate extra complexity other than by adding more genes. One is the general idea of combinatorial complexity - with just a few extra proteins one could make a much larger number of different combinations between them. ... The two teams' first scanning of the genome suggests ... ways in which humans have become more complex than worms. One comes from analysis of what are called protein domains. Proteins, the working parts of the cell, are often multipurpose tools, with each role being performed by a different section or domain of the protein. Many protein domains are very ancient. Comparing the domains of proteins made by the roundworm, the fruit fly and people, the consortium reports that only 7 percent of the protein domains found in people were absent from worm and fly, suggesting that \"few new protein domains have been invented in the vertebrate lineage.\" But these domains have been mixed and matched in the vertebrate line to create more complex proteins. ... Evolution has devised another ingenious way of increasing complexity, which is to divide a gene into several different segments and use them in different combinations to make different proteins. The protein-coding segments of a gene are known as exons and the DNA in between as introns. The initial transcript of a gene is processed by a delicate piece of cellular machinery known as a spliceosome, which strips out all the introns and joins the exons together. Sometimes, perhaps because of signals from the introns that have yet to be identified, certain exons are skipped, and a different protein is made. The ability to make different proteins from the same gene is known as alternative splicing. The consortium's biologists say that alternative splicing is more common in human cells than in the fly or worm and that the full set of human proteins could be five times as large as the worm's. Another possible source of extra complexity is that human proteins have sugars and other chemical groups attached to them after synthesis."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"There's a different explanation of human complexity, which is simply that the new low-ball figure of human genes derived by Celera and consortium is a gross undercount. Dr. William Haseltine, president of Human Genome Sciences, has long maintained that there are 120,000 or so human genes. ... Dr. Haseltine ... remains unshaken in his estimate of 100,000 to 120,000 genes. He said last week that his company had captured and sequenced 90,000 full-length genes, from which all alternative splice forms and other usual sources of confusion have been removed. He has made and tested the proteins from 10,000 of these genes. The consortium and Celera have both arrived at the same low number because both are using the same faulty methods, in his view. ... Dr. Haseltine notes that the gene-finding methods used by the two teams depend in part on looking for genes like those already known, a procedure that may well miss radically different types of genes. His own method, capturing the genes produced by variety of human cell types, is one that Dr. Venter says in his paper is the ultimate method of counting human genes. ... Dr. Eric S. Lander of the Whitehead Institute last week challenged Dr. Haseltine to make public all the genes he had found in a 1 percent region of the genome and let others assess his claim. ... Dr. Haseltine said yesterday that he was contemplating the best way to respond and that he was \"planning to do so in one form or another, in the open literature.\" Turning from genes to chromosomes, one of the most interesting discoveries in this week's papers concerns segmental duplications, or the copying of whole blocks of genes from one chromosome to the other. These block transfers are so extensive that they seem to have been a major evolutionary factor in the genome's present size and architecture. They may arise because of a protective mechanism in which the cell reinserts broken-off fragments of DNA back into the chromosomes. In Celera's genome article, Dr. Venter presents a table showing how often blocks of similar genes in the same order can be found throughout the genome. Chromosome 19 seems the biggest borrower, or maybe lender, with blocks of genes shared with 16 other chromosomes. ... Segmental duplication is an important source of innovation because the copied block of genes is free to develop new functions. ... Celera ordered the world's most powerful civilian computer to calculate how to assemble its 27 million 500-base pair fragments into an entire genome. Its rival, the public consortium of academic centers, felt no need for a massive computer and assembly program because its genome decoding strategy didn't require one. But a computational biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, whose supervisor had been asked to help identify genes, realized the genome had to be assembled before gene identification could begin. In four weeks Jim Kent wrote an assembly program that put the consortium's jumble of DNA fragments into coherent order. It was this assembled sequence on which most of the consortium's genome analysis is based. Mr. Kent also wrote a browser, a program that aligns the known genes and other interpretive"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"information in tracks above the actual genome sequence. Anyone wanting to take a tour of the human genome, with Mr. Kent's browser as their guide, can do so at genome.ucsc.edu. ... One of the most intriguing hints that new biology may be discovered in the genome comes from an initial survey of the mouse genome, which Celera said this week it had assembled. Laying the mouse genome sequence over the human sequence is extremely revealing because most of the DNA has diverged in the 100 million years since mouse and man last shared a common ancestor. The DNA regions that are similar between the two species are those important enough to have been conserved. At a stroke, almost all the genes fall out as noticeably similar. So too do many of the control regions of DNA that precede the genes. And Dr. Craig Venter, president of Celera, has now stated that there is a third category of similar DNA regions, which are not genes but are too extensive to be control regions. No one yet knows what the mystery regions are doing. ...\". According to a 21 January 2003 article in The New York Times by Andrew Pollack: \"... RNA and DNA are strings of chemical units called bases that embody the genetic code. The bases are represented by the letters A, C, G and either T in DNA or U in RNA. The C base always binds to G. A binds only to T or U. So a single strand of DNA or RNA can bind to another strand that has the complementary bases. Under what is known as the central dogma of genetics, genes, which are the recipes for making proteins, are part of the DNA of the chromosomes. When a protein is to be made, the DNA is copied onto a corresponding piece of single-stranded RNA, known as messenger RNA, that delivers the recipe to the cell's protein-making machinery. Proteins make up most of a cell and perform most of its functions, including turning genes on and off. But new evidence suggests that some RNA is not merely the intermediary between DNA and protein, but the end product. Some huge stretches of DNA that do not contain protein-coding genes and have been considered \"junk\" actually hold the code for some of this RNA. ... ... in addition to the DNA's containing the recipes for proteins, a lot more DNA was being copied into RNA. The recently deciphered mouse genome was found to have about twice as much in common with the human genome as could be accounted for by protein-coding genes. ...

Mammalian cells, confronted with long double-strand RNA, basically destroy themselves as a defense against pathogens. But two years ago scientists at the Max Planck Institute found that short double-strand RNA, again about 21 to 23 bases, would not set off the self-destructive response but would silence the corresponding gene. ...\". According to a 7 July 2001 BBC article by Helen Briggs: \"... Two rival teams that cracked the human genome may have underestimated the number of human genes, according to a new computer analysis. Scientists in the United States claim humans are built from 66,000 genes, nearly twice as many as the current consensus. ... a ... team, based at Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, has reanalysed the raw data, using a supercomputer, and come up with a higher estimate for the number of human genes. \"We ended up with a higher estimated number of genes than the other two teams because we compared 13"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"different gene databases to the DNA sequences in the draft genome produced by the Human Genome Project,\" said Bo Yuan of Ohio State University. ... The discrepancy seems to arise from the process used to analyse human genetic data. ...

Buried within these coded instructions are the genes - 'sentences' which hold the instructions for the proteins of which human tissue is made. The genes occupy only about a hundredth of the length of the huge string of DNA, broken up into the 46 chromosomes in every cell. To fish out the genes, which are hidden among the long continuous string of letters, scientists rely on genetic databases. ... The Ohio State University team says Celera's genome map, and particularly, the Human Genome Project map relied mainly on two databases to locate the genes. They used these two databases plus 11 others. \"We used more experimental evidence in assembling our map, and that suggests that there are probably between 65,000 and 75,000 transcriptional units,\" said Dr Yuan. A transcriptional unit is a length of DNA that shows strong evidence of being a gene but which requires future verification. This is where the dispute arises. \"Some researchers are unsettled by the certainty with which the Human Genome Consortium is presenting its lower gene count,\" said Fred Wright of Ohio State University. \"In my view, the final number of genes - when it is known - will lie somewhere between their high of 40,000 and our value of 70,000.\" ... Arguments over how many genes it takes to build a human being look set to continue. A gene sweepstake set up by scientists attending the Cold Spring Harbor Genome Meetings in the United States is still taking entries. To date, there have been 165 bets, ranging from 27,462 to 153,478 human genes. So far, the money is on 61,710. ...\".

In that connection, the hexacode H6 is related to Golay codes and the Leech lattice. The hexacode H6 can be used to construct quantum-error-correcting codes that are based on GF(4), and an RNA code is based on 4 nucleotides UGAC, taken 3 at a time.

"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Katya Walter has shown that the representation of the DNA code by Fu Xi's Ho Tu arrangement of the I Ching is not superficial. The 55 points of the Ho Tu diagram can be divided into 27 SouthEast points and 28 NorthWest points, if the central point is put into the NorthWest part. The G-C base pair has 15 ring atoms and 12 other atoms, just as the SouthEast part has 15 even points and 12 odd points. The T-A base pair has 15 ring atoms and 13 other atoms, just as the NouthWest part has 15 even points and 13 odd points. If the central point is allowed to remain central, and represent a U(1) propagator phase, then both the SouthEast and NorthWest parts have 15 even points and 12 odd points, so that they represent the 15 generators of the Spin(6) that gives conformal gravity and the Higgs mechanism and the 12 generators of the SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) standard model, that is, all the gauge bosons of the D4-D5-E6-E7-E8 VoDou Physics model spacetime. Note that, to represent physical structures such as the DNA code and the D4-D5-E6-E7 model gauge bosons, the proper axis for the Ho Tu diagram is NorthEast-SouthWest, which is different from the North-South axis used to represent abstract Yin-Yang binary math structure. Such a diagonal axis will be used in the Lo Shu diagram, which is more oriented to representations of physical structures, as opposed to abstract structures. China's third emperor Huang Di started the present Chinese calendar on 10 February 2697 BC.

The NorthEast-SouthWest axis is Earth-Earth-Earth, SouthEast and East are Wood, NorthWest and West are Metal, and South is Fire and North is Water. Although the Lo Shu is not very symmetrical with respect to abstract Yin-Yang binary structure, the Lo Shu diagram does have the interesting mathematical structure of a Magic Square: "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" In addition to Square tilings of the plane, there are Hexagonal tilings.

Perhaps because of its lack of abstract Yin-Yang binary symmetry, the Later Heaven Lo Shu arrangement of the 8 trigrams did not lead Yu to make a corresponding arrangement of the 64 hexagrams. It was not until about 3,100 years ago that Wen-wang (father of the founder of the Zhou dynasty) made a Lo Shu arrangement of the 64 hexagrams. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Since Wen-wang's son Wu-wang named him (posthumously) as the first emperor of the Zhou dynasty, Wen-wang is known as King Wen, and his arrangement of the 64 hexagrams often called the King Wen arrangement. King Wen created his arrangement while imprisoned by the Shang emperor. It was not an arrangement to describe abstract principles, but to describe his life and how it could be useful in overthrowing the corrupt Shang emperor and setting up a better government. The 64 King Wen hexagrams are arranged in 32 dual pairs. For 28 of the pairs, one is the other turned upside down. 8 hexagrams are the same turned upside down, so they make up 4 pairs of opposites. The 28 upside-down symmetric pairs have a similar symmetry to the 28-dimensional antisymmetric real 8x8 matrices that represent Spin(0,8) of the D4-D5-E6-E7 physics model. King Wen's arrangement is designed for life in our physical world, beginning with pure Yang, forward moving Heaven, and ending with a hexagram described by two characters that mean \"not yet across (a river)\", so that its ending is really also a beginning, just as in real life. Perhaps that is why the King Wen arrangement is the one most often seen in present-day I Ching books. Another son of King Wen was the Duke of Zhou, the brother of King Wu (Wu-wang). When King Wen wrote about the 64 hexagrams, he wrote for each entire hexagram a Judgment. The Duke of Zhou wrote a poetic text,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"the Line Text, for each hexagram Judgment. Each poem line corresponds to a hexagram line, and each whole poem goes with the Chinese characters for each hexagram Judgment. Much later commentaries, such as the Ten Wings, have been added to the present-day I Ching books. My opinion about such later commentaries is the same as that of Rosemary and Kerson Huang: \"The poetic aspect of the I Ching, however, has been obscured by the Ten Wings. How can you enjoy poetry if every line is followed by government regulations on how to read it?\" The King Wen I Ching sequence was used by Terence McKenna to construct his Timewave model of history. Of course, it is possible to make other arrangements of the 8 trigrams and 64 hexagrams of the I Ching than the Fu Xi and King Wen arrangements. The 8 trigrams can be arranged in 8! = 40,320 different orders. As well as ordering the 8 trigrams differently, you can pick subsets of the 8 trigrams. That can also be done in many ways: there are 2^8 = 256 subsets of the 8 trigrams. The number of subsets of the 8 trigrams is the dimension of the Cl(0,8) Clifford algebra that is used in the D4-D5-E6-E7 physics model and is related to ordering the 8 trigrams by the Clifford sequence corresponding to the binary numbers from 0 through 7 You can arrange the 64 hexagrams in 64! (about 1.27 x 10^89) different orders. As well as ordering the 64 hexagrams differently, you can pick subsets of the 64 hexagrams. That can also be done in many ways: there are 2^64 (about 1.844 x 10^19) subsets of the 64 hexagrams. The number of subsets of the 64 hexagrams is useful in estimating the Planck mass. If you want more possibilities, consider the (2^64)! possible orderings of all 2^64 subsets of the 64 hexagrams. If you want still more, consider the possible orderings within each of the 2^64 subsets of the 64 hexagrams.

A natural ordering of the 64 hexagrams is the I Ching lattice of Billy Culver in which the 64 hexagrams are in groups of 4 + 16 + (12+12) + 16 + 4 = 4 + 16 + 24 + 16 + 4 = 64 This can be seen as a 4-fold expansion of the 1 4 6 4 1 level of the Su Meru triangle.

A version of the Tai Hsuan Ching was written by Yang Hsiung, who lived from about 53 BC to about 18 AD. As the I Ching is based on hexagrams of binary lines, for a total of 2x2x2x2x2x2 = 8x8 = 64 hexagrams, the Tai Hsuan Ching is based on tetragrams of ternary lines, for a total of 3x3x3x3 = 9x9 = 81 tetragrams. It seems to me as though Vedic divination and Tai Shuan Ching are based on the Triality aspect of the 256-dimensional Cl(8) Clifford algebra of IFA, while I Ching is based on the 64-dimensional Cl(6) Clifford subalgebra of the Cl(8) of IFA.

The Tai Hsuan Ching may be at least as old as the King Wen arrangement of the I Ching, since such tetragrams have been found on Shang and Zhou dynasty oracle bones. To construct the Tai Hsuan Ching, start with the 3x3 I Ching Magic Square | | 4 | 9 | 2 _____|_____|_____ | | 3 | 5 | 7 _____|_____|_____ | | 8 | 1 | 6 | | whose central number, 5, is also central in the sequence 1,2,3,4, 5, 6,7,8,9 which sequence corresponds to the octonions 1,i,j,k, 0, E,I,J,K whose total number for each line is 15, the dimension of the largest Hopf fibration and the dimension of the imaginary sedenions. If you take into account the direction in which you add each of the 8 ways, and add all directed ways together you get a total of 16x15 = 240 which is the number of vertices of a Witting polytope. The total of all 9 numbers is 45, the dimension of the D5 Lie algebra Spin(10) that is used in the D4-D5-E6-E7 physics model in which the D4 Spin(8) subgroup of Spin(10) corresponds to 28 bivector gauge bosons and the 16-dimensional homogeneous space Spin(10) / Spin(8)xU(1) corresponds to an 8-dimensional complex domain whose Shilov boundary is RP1 x S7 corresponding to an 8-dimensional spacetime. Notice that the 3x3 Magic Square gives the gauge bosons and the spacetime of the D4-D5-E6-E7 physics model but does not contain the spinor fermions. The 3 generations of spinor fermions corresond to a Lie Algebra Magic Square. The Tai Hsuan Ching construction will give us the spinor fermions, and therefore corresponds to the complete D4-D5-E6-E7 physics model.

In the Chinese Equinox, Motta claims the document has been identified and will be eventually published. This never came to be. But in Ray Eales „Red Equinox,‟ this document is found, which is a perfect resemblance to what is described. Though we in our lineage make claim to some profound restorations, Motta has the distinction of being the first to do this work."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Concerning the Coins of the Ge Yuan On the Autumnal Equinox of 1980 e.v., in the span of a day and an evening, Marcelo Motta took to a concentrated effort to respond to a call of inspiration from what seems by the account of his students, a state of Samadhi. He quietly took to his private room and secluded himself off from his housemates, not leaving his room for any reason. When he emerged from this work, he had with him the Map of the “Coins of the Ge Yuan.” He had reconciled the trigrams of Fu Xi with the Qabalistic Tree-of-Life utilizing Frater Perdurabo's attributions. This can certainly be seen as an illuminated addition to the Sepher Sephiroth and a method of divination equilibrating the ancient Chinese wisdom of the Yi Jing. As well, this provides for as a wonderful addition to the Thelemic Qabala. It is suggested that one make coins from the diagrams provided and shuffle the coins, tossing them forward in a manner of ones own device. Then lay these upon a diagram of the Tree and begin your divination. Motta suggested the one would then be working in the method of the Yellow, White and Black Schools of the Great White Brotherhood. Certainly, Crowley‟s equilibration of the Yi Jing with the Tarot demonstrates the White and Yellow schools. More than likely the fact that the trigrams were made into coins is the reason for Motta suggesting the Black school, but no correlation for any of these three schools is found in any notes of Motta‟s known to be extant."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"MAP OF THE COINS: Editorial Note The Dyad is represented on the Tree-of-Life as being composed of the seven Sephiroth below the Abyss. In this, Motta‟s restoration, we are provided with forty coins. Crowley remarks that there would be 128 figures that as the Grand Master Baphomet, he would “invent” in this projected work. 128 is twice 64, the number of Hexagrams in the Yi Jing. And so it may simply be that Crowley abandoned the production of Liber XLIX in deference to his translation of the Yi Jing.3 But Motta‟s work here, represents a valuable contribution to the science of Thelema. For this reason, it is presented by the A.M.H.R.   3 We also find this note in the Red Flame archives of the Cornelius lineage: SHIH YI, A Critical and Mnemonic Paraphrase of the Yi King being The Equinox Volume III No.7, by Ko Yuen (Aleister Crowley) Monthelema, H.Parsons Smith, Oceanside, CA, HB, 1971 Note: The original manuscript, or versions of the mnemonic verses of the Yi King (known as the Shih Yi), are located under a different entry.
