There remains therefore (to pursue the imagery) of the adept“nothing but a little pile of dust.” In a subsequent vision the Grade of Magus is foreshadowed; and thefigure is that this dust is burnt into “a white ash,” which ash is preserved in an Urn. It is difficult to conveythe appropriateness of this symbolism, but the general idea is that the earthly or receptive part of the Masteris destroyed. That which remains 1 [This description is by Crowley, from “The Official Instructions of A§A§,” Book 4,Parts I–IV, rev. ed., Appendix I, §4, p. 467.]2 [CITE.]3 [Adapted from Crowley’s Confessions, abridged ed., pp. 795–797.]ILiber LXXIIIThe Urn"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The Diary of a Magus12 The Equinoxhas passed through fire; and is therefore, in a sense, of the nature of fire. The Urn is engraved with a wordor symbol expressive of the nature of the being whose ash is therein. The Magus is thus, of course, not aperson in any ordinary sense; he represents a certain nature or idea. To put it otherwise, we may say, theMagus is a word. He is the Logos of the Æon which he brings to pass.1The above is obscure. I perceived and deplore the fact. The idea may be more intelligible, examined in thelight of history.Gautama Buddha was a Magus. His word was Anatta; that is, the whole of his system, whichrevolutionized the thought of Asia, may be considered as based upon and consecrated in that one word,which is his denial of the existence of the Atman or “soul” of Hindu philosophy.Later, Mohammed also partially overturned an age by uttering his word, Allah. But to us, practically, themost important case of the kind is that connected with such “gods” as Dionysus, Osiris, Baldur, Marsyas,Adonis, Jesus, and other deifications of the unknown Magus concerned. The old pagan worship of theMother­idea was superseded by the word IAO or its equivalents, which asserted the formula of the DyingGod, and made the Male, dying to himself in the act of love, the engineer of the continued life of the race.This revolution cut at the root of all previous custom. Matriarchy vanished; self­sacrifice became thecardinal virtue, and so through infinite ramifications.This idea of accomplishing the Great Work by a voluntary death was bound up with the belief that the sundied, and was reborn with the hours and the seasons. Astronomy having exploded this fiction, mankindwas ready to gain a further comprehension of its own parallel case.My own word, Thelema, supplies a new and scientifically sound basis for ethics. Self­sacrifice is aromantic folly; death does not end life; it is a temporary phase of life as night and winter are of terrestrialactivity. Many other conceptions are implied in this word, Thelema. In particular, each individual isconceived as the 1 Cf. Rabelais: the final secret is in the bottle inscribed trinc.Liber 73 % The Urn 5 Introduction 13centre of his own universe, his essential nature determining his relations with similar beings and his propercourse of action. It is obvious that these ideas are revolutionary. Yet to oppose them is to blasphemescience. Already, in a thousand ways, the principles involved have replaced those of the Dying God. Littleremains but to accept Thelema consciously as a statement of law, so that any given problem may be solvedby applying it to each case.The man Crowley had been chosen to enunciate this Law, that is, to exercise the essential function of aMagus. But he had yet to understand it, a task which involved the crossing of the Abyss, already described;and further, to identify his will with the Law, so that his personality might act as the focus of its energy.Before he could be that pure will whose name is that word, he had to be purged by fire of all competing"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"volitions; and this was done by those who had chosen him during this part of his life, which I am about torecord.He had indeed got rid of his sense of the personal self, yet his force was discharging itself dispersedlythrough all sorts of channels appropriate to the various elements in his nature. It was necessary to constrainevery particle of his energy to move in one sole direction. (The physical analogy of a gas whose electronsare polarized and one not so organized is not so bad.)It must now be explained how he was able to understand what was happening to him in this initiation—hislife from 1914 to 1919. The Grade of Magus is traditionally connected with the idea of the number 2; malecreative energy, wisdom and the expression of a single idea in terms of duality. It transmits the idea of thedivine unity to its feminine counterpart, the understanding, somewhat as a man transmits the essence of hisracial character to his wife so that he perceives his inmost nature, itself unintelligible to him directly, byobserving the flowering of that essence in his son. The Hebrew title of the idea embodying thesecharacteristics is Chokmah, whose numerical value is 73. This fact appears arbitrary and irrelevant; but itforms part of the symbolic language in which the præterhuman intelligences who control the initiatecommunicate with him. Thus, my adventures in America seemed a series of stupidities for a long time.Nothing I did produced the 14 The Equinoxexpected results. I found myself suddenly switched from one episode to another so irrationally that I beganto feel that I had somehow got into a world where causality did not obtain. The mystery only became clearwhen analysis disclosed that the events which threw me about in this manner occurred at almost exactintervals of 73 days, or of some multiple or sub­multiple thereof.I understood from this that 73 terrestrial days made up a single day of initiation.11 [The chronology of the Chokmah­days is roughly as follows; italicized dates are confirmed in Crowley’s writings:I.

In this I succeeded so well that towards the end I became ableto predict the sort of thing that would happen to me beforehand, which helped me to meet circumstancesintelligently and make the fullest and most appropriate use of them.One further point with regard to this initiation must be mentioned, though it sounds so fantastic even tomyself that I can scarcely smother a smile. In the ancient ceremonies of the Egyptians the candidate wasconfronted or guided on his journey by priests wearing the masks of various animals, the traditionalcharacter of each serving to indicate the function of its wearer. Quaint as it sounds, I found myselfdiscovering an almost stupefying physical resemblance to divers symbolic animals in those individualswhose influence on me, during their appointed period, was paramount.11 [These “Officers” (portraits of many of whom appear as Figs. XXX–XXX, facing p.

There was some girl there with whom I wanted to be alone, but I can’t remember who,how, or why?)In any case, I found myself on a grassy hill, which was the west side of the Butte Montmartre, and also aUniversity, and I had to walk round to the south side to get to 56th St. where you lived. For I wished tomake a last effort to see you. But I only decided this because I went to sleep “for a moment” on the grassand waking found it was 9:30 a.m. (I wondered why it was so light.

A spark sprang tothe middle joint of the middle finger of my left hand.From this I conclude:1. The Masters still need me; the Initiation is real. Cf. the fall with my horse on the Burma­China frontier in1905.2. I have repeatedly thought that death must be the issue of this initiation. This is then wrong.It seems to me as if this Initiation were taking place “elsewhere,” i.e., not in my consciousness at all. It isobviously too big for my human consciousness; yet its results must work down through that.I will write down my woe, that maybe it be thereby alleviated.... There is nothing in me that corresponds at all to the grade.There is utter impotence on all planes. This has persisted through the whole period, save for short spells,when I have been more or less normal. But always I slip back into the state for which I find idiocy anadequate and even euphemistic term. I do not in the least fail to understand the grade; I am simply unable toact. It is no good making up my mind to do anything material; for I have no means. But this would vanish ifI could make up my mind. I am as it were inhibited from everything. I am tempted for example to crucify atoad, or copulate with a duck, sheep, or goat, or set a house on fire or murder someone with the idea—aperfectly good magical idea, of course—that some supreme violation of all the laws of my being wouldbreak my karma, or dissolve the spell that seems to bind me.

But I have reconquered general good health and high spirits—ten very vigorous IX° and XI°operations in 12 days!—I have overcome the financial trouble to some purpose; and this without destroyingthe conviction of my approaching change. My diagnosis may be be wrong; in any case I have had theordeal. Yet I am quite cheerfully making plans for the “future” which will probably never arrive.By the way, the “Brown Girl” has materialized exactly as seen in my vision of last year,1 and the Tarot cardof this Equinox.Anna Catherine Miller is her name and we are living together in a room on Central Park West, where wecan see nothing but trees!Glory to the Otz Chiim,2 in whose boughs the Wonder Bird, the Swan Paramahansa, makes his nest.3Sept. 3.

This is an argument for auras. It is lovethat opens the gates of the heavens, will that shuts those of the hells. I got this as a flash of cosmic memory.As a rational corollary, I got: Love is the power to say “yes”; will the power to say “no.” Cheap epigramleading to heresy; beware!My 9°=2á consciousness is now quite fixed in the depths.There is a point in evolution where all the different lines of argument run together with a rush I wasidentifying the eye of a potato with the Eye of Horus, when all the other eyes joined in the dance!

This seems a good joke, with a Christmassy flavour, so I laugh. Then Ithink of those who don’t see the joke, like the poor little boys who have no turkey, so I get a maudlinsadness. this is all one idea and might be called the Pickwick­complex!“One stops taking ether not from fear, but because one reaches one’s limit. This is distressing, but shouldnot be. One has done one’s own Great work; it is for one’s Holy Guardian Angel to do His.

Sol in Libra.A very elaborate operation in which as the result of a most profound psychology I obtained the Word “Dowhat thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” Objections that it is not a single word, etc., are quitenugatory. I object to recasting it as Qelhma, for instance. I cannot possibly explain the series of exclusionswhich I have devised for obtaining the supreme Consciousness and Will; but it doth suffice.1 [Anna Catherine Miller, whom Crowley called the Dog.]2 [CITE QUOTE.]Liber 73 % The Urn 5 1917–1918 e.v. 67The Qelhma divination1 is “VII” VI:14: “There are deep secrets in these songs. to enjoy song he must bethe bird.”Sept. 27.I’ve been ill—liver chill and cold, etc. Every phenomenon is a Change; all Change is interesting as such;therefore the Universe is Joy.
