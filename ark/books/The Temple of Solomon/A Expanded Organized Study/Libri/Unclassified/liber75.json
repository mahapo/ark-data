Here we have a series of oneness, expressed in manifold beauty. 4. I and the earth are one, for the earth is one with heaven. 5. And this one is but the misapprehension of none. 6. Oh, my children! What word is there for the unfaithful? 7. My dear little ones, why do you not know that I, which am you, am one with the angel? 8. And the angel and the god are one. 9. The goddess is none, she to whom all gods are but specks of light in the deep well of her womb.10. My children, the heirs of Θελημα, follow me that you may one day outgrow me.11. For the sheep shall slay the shepherd, and be of a sudden transformed into wolves — such are my chosen, of whom even the mountain goat trembles in riotous fear.12. Who is the lone wolf among you?13. Let him be King of the pack.14. Your howling shall be the shrill joy of the devoted atheist, for you fear not the Virgin, nor do you fear the Great Liberator.15. There is nothing in you or about you that you fear. All is venerable, all is composed of the stuff of your mind, spun about you in all directions, that you might one day capture and suck the sweet and radiant butterfly of bliss.16. Take suck thereof, o my chosen? Take suck? That little creature shall feed you with the juice of vacuity."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"17. Thou, even thou, art that creature. My good scribe, continue. I am verbose, but each word is a lightning bolt from my own heart.18. Thou wonderest at the fierceness of my expression, the icy blueness of my skin — where there should be gold, the spinning kaleidoscope of my eyewells, the sky-hewn cape I have wrapped about me, snapping and glittering with electricity and wisdom unrevealed.19. A wind arises from within the circle, unfelt, but perceived.20. My hair is uplifted into the clouds, which are my hair.21.I shall strike up a storm therewith such as the world has seen never.22. A hammer for my chosen — an anvil for the wicked.23. My Queen, I have been with thee, my little Lady of the Snows. I am pleased with thy success.24. Suck the life from this success, that it may be transformed into one stronger, and lovelier, and visible for all to see!25. There are worriers within the camp, and those who withhold their blood.26. I shall lap up your blood in life or in death, in joy or in woe. There appeareth a Choice. But I have chosen you.27. Go on! Go on!28. Perform the ritual of the war-engine with strength and gladness.29. All else shall follow.30. I am monstrous strong. I am more brute than Hercules; even I uphold the world, for I am of the world, and the earth is my little bride.31. She hath been ailing, ailing with the turmoil of pubescence.32. I am coming, sweet one! Lo! I come! And the pain of virginity shall be a distant dream, forgotten, hardly believable."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"33. Open thy mouth, o little Ram, and receive the phallus of the mirthful one, the God of Song, of Order and delight.34. This Apollo is the good friend of Bacchus — watch them cavort in the field of possibilities!35. Not all of thy wisdom is correct.36. The child of these two men lives and breathes, though in a different manner from the child of women.37. There was a time when I beheld Diana and Aphrodite striding hand in hand.38. There was Hera, enraged with jealousy, while Zeus snuck away with the cup-bearer.39. There was also Europa and the Bull.40. Nor did I frown at their joy.41. Fear not, o Mercury, who sittest atop the eight-sided house. There is success.42. Also shall there be success for the duteous one, that little child so sweet to my heart, burdened with travail and depression.43. There is an end to such pain. Watch! O Queen of Heaven, Babalon, the Red-Cloaked One. Thou shalt toss off that funny, little hood. Thou shalt wander randomly, ever joyous, throughout the long corridors of palacious Time.44. Thou mayst even pause to linger by the column by the purple fountain. Go! swim in this wine, frothing and fragrant. There shall be no stain; no pain upon Awakening.45. Also there shall be an earthly palace and a capital city. Even so, there shall be joy, and the faint memory of pain lost.46. And you! All of you!

There is pleasure in the falling star.48. My Book shall be translated into all tongues, and delivered to all lands.49. Do this quickly!50. Count these verses, o scribe, and discover the number thereof.51. That number shall bear the title of this message, which message thou shalt send to all concerned.52. The writing is complete; I gave you no more. This is not that writing. This is conversation.53. With a deep sigh I look upon ye all; if my wisdom were human, I should feel sorry, and conclude that there is little hope for Θελημα and the Nation BABALON.54. Stand back, ye heathen! For I aim my first bolt!55. My arm, as large as a house, rippling with the lust of Vengeance, lets loose the blinding, steely, weapon of Joy!56. The Night lights up with a wicked scream, and the little rats of Avidya go scrambling off into all directions, fearful of the tumult, the thunder, the brightness of Liberty and Life.57. There is a man seated upon a throne, a god of a man, and in his right hand there is a scepter, topped with the head of a Phoenix.58. All about are guards, and men at arms; civilians and priests.59. They chase the little rats away; some are eaten for dinner.60. O, laughing boy! Grow strong! May the might of thy breath, as of thy fist, level the small and the meek, the miniscule ministers of trivial matters."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"61. Also, you shall be strong in Spirit, lean and well-formed. The fat of thought and sickly fears shall be shed, as you feed on a diet of god’s blood, of stars milk, and earthsperm.62. Also there shall be meat and wine, and all rare substances for to delight the flesh and inspire the mind.63. There is a little jar of fish-eggs, rare and priceless, and within the oyster is the Pearl of Great Price.64. Come with me then, and let us feast on joy, and on life.65.Let us consume all rich foods, and delight in true beauty, in contest.66. There is a joy which exceeds all others. That is the joy of battle, and the winning of the Holy Grail.67. Nor is the Cup to be found on Montségur, nor in Palestine where three Lands meet. It is all things to each man. It is the Summum Bonum, the True Self; it is Conquest and Wealth.68. There is an Opener of the Ways. Let him determine his course of action, under the guidance of the Crown.69. Let all Rulers be free in their activity; yet this freedom is the freedom of harmony. O woe! if galaxies crash.70. There is more, for my wrath is mounting, and I may let loose a second bolt.71. But not now.72. Await this attack, dear boy, for the second shall be worse than the first!73. And thou shalt watch the effects of the first; ye all shall watch.74.
