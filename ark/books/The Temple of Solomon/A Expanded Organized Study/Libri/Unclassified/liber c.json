The Gnostics & the Manichaeans sought to preserve it in their secret assemblies or Agapai as they had received it from the greatest of the Magi of Egypt; nor were the Ophites ignorant of this mystery, nor the men that did worship unto Mithras. Moreover, the secret is hidden in the fable of Samson; and almost revealed in the apologues of the Gospel of John. This was the inmost secret of the Knights of the Temple, & the Brethren of the Rosie Cross concealed it in their College of the Holy Ghost; but the first had it under the form of the serpent, & the second of the dove; as it is written: \"Nor let the fools mistake love; for there are love and love. There is the dove, and there is the serpent. Choose ye well! He, my prophet, hath chosen, knowing the law of the fortress, and the great mystery of the House of God.\" AL I:57 From them & from their successors the Hermetic Brothers of Light have we received this secret; moreover hath it been clarified by the genius of our Lord Therion, and the guidance of Him who gave us the Book of the Law.

Is it not written that ye are the temples of the Living God? Know ye not that every man and every woman is a star?

They conquer by subtlety or by strength; they have right to the Tree of Life and Knowledge; but either way, they must enter in through the Gate into the City. For without are dogs & sorcerers & whoremongers & murderers & idolaters & whosoever loveth & maketh a lie. So said He that was the root & offspring of David, & the Bright & Morning Star.

DE ALCHYMISTIS Our illuminated brethren the Alchymists, being wise with the wisdom of God, & cunning with the cunning of men, did apply themselves more especially to physical magick, to the finding of the Medicine of Metals & the Philosopher’s Stone, the Tinctures White & Red, & the Elixir of Life. For (said they) with wealth cometh leisure, & with health energy, & with long life an extension of time; all these will we devote to the performance of the Great Work.

DE NOMINE DEI I beseech you to understand, very illustrious Dames & Sir Knights, very perfectly"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"illuminated Sisters & Brethren, that this secret dependeth first & last upon the One most High. He is not One whom minds can easily apprehend; & although our hearts dissolve in love, that sufficeth not for us to attain to Him, for He abideth as the Sun of the soul, that reflecteth Him indeed, but normally absorbeth Him not. Now He is the Father that createth, the Word that transmitteth & the Spirit that receiveth, as also the Spirit proceeding from the Father is the Essence that uniteth the Father to the son; & this Mystery was concealed in many sacred names that have been revealed to you, very illustrious Dames & Sir Knights & very perfectly illuminated Sisters & Brethren of our Ancient Order. Learn therefore now this, the third motto of our Supreme Council, that it signifieth. DEUS EST HOMO, that is GOD IS MAN. That which meaneth that AS ABOVE, SO BELOW; AS WITHOUT, SO WITHIN. There is no part of man that is not GOD; & there is no part of GOD that hath not its counterpart in man. Now learn also this, that GOD is never to be known entirely by mind; for all mind knoweth is but mind’s creation, and mind was created by He. Thou knowest Him in the proportion that thou art He. Now, there are Three that bear witness in Heaven: the Father (Kether), the Word (Chokmah) and the Spirit (Binah); & these three are One (Daath, or Ra-Hoor-Khu). And there are Three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit (Babalon), the Water, & the Blood; & these three are One. In that trinity IAO, I is the Father, A the Spirit, O the Word; and in this trinity A is the Spirit, M the Water, SH the Blood; and together these sum 358, MshICh, the Messiah that Christians called their Lord & Savior Jesus Christ, that in his fabled death gave up the Spirit, the Water & the Blood, as is written in the Gospel of John. Hence to Christians this name Jesus Christ symbolized the Alpha & Omega, the union of GOD & man. Herein another Trinity: GOD, GOD-man, man. And to this GOD-man our ancient brethren gave many other names. And though this name of Jesus Christ was universally blasphemed by Christians, yet this name was acknowledged by the true Brothers of the Rosie Cross; & what was written of Him in the Evangels & the Epistles & the Apocalypse was true, if it be interpreted in light by the adepts of the Stone. For this GOD-man is in truth ourselves: we are both GOD & men. Yet the Testament of that perception, being betrayed & given to the multitude, was profaned; verily as in it is written, Cast not your pearls before swine, lest they turn again & rend you! Therefore for their betrayal of their own truths were the Christians shunned by the Adepts, and persecuted the Adepts, for two thousand years."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" See then to it, very illustrious Dame or Sir Knight, that by no fault of thine be this our truth profaned: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. DE ARCANO FRATRUM AMUSSIS Now, of Him we learn that the Image of our Lord is the Sun, Father, Creator, Preserver & Destroyer, One, Exalted, Perfect, Giver of Life & Death, Vice-gerent and Vice-regent of Heaven, who in this Aeon is called Heru-ra-ha. And upon Earth is His representative the Son, the Sacred Eidolon within the Ark of the covenant, the Rod wherein Prometheus brought down Fire from Heaven. The Christians worshiped Him as Christ and feared Him as Satan, ill understanding His Nature; for that He is sacred & secret beyond all that are or may be. And He is 666. Either Image or Son of the All-Father seemed to undergo Death & Resurrection; & the outer symbols are in this sense cognate; & the Feasts of one & the other have been celebrated throughout all recorded time by the Outer of all faiths. And the vulgar, ignorant of the Inner meaning, mingled the two worships in the last Aeon, appointing the times of the one & the seasons of the other, the observances of the Son & the ordinances of the Father in the same ritual; wherefore have minds been darkened and understandings confounded. Thus at Easter was the Crucifixion or Copulation, & nine months later was the Birth of the Child, which lived 33 years, being a generation of mankind in those unhealthy days, & was crucified. Yet was this commingled with the descent of the Sun (so-seemed) below the Equator & His apparent resurrection, & again with His illusory daily agony as the Earth turneth in Her dance. Now then our Brethren, having the true keys of all religions, namely that all cults typify either the Mysteries of Lingam & Yoni or of Sol, Luna, & Terra, can for themselves interpret all rites, create new faiths & new feasts, ruling the world in justice & righteousness under the Law of Thelema. For this is the Arcanumof the Hierophants of old, that in this cult of the Sun in Heaven & of the Phallus on Earth all men can unite, for that these mysteries are reasonable & true, and no man can deny them, provided that names be not confused with the things they stand for. This is that which is written: \"Peace on Earth, Good will towards men!\" And this is the true & final secret of Phremasonry; this Sun, is it not the Great Architect of the Universe, the Father of the System, the Eidolon of the Macrocosm? And this Phallus, is it not the Great Architect of this other Universe of Man, the Father of the Race, the Eidolon of the Microcosm? Is not this that Truth, which is established in the mouth of two witnesses? Wherefore be ye vigilant, preserving that Kingdom of God which is within you from defilement, chaste unto your Lord that is Light, Life, Love & Liberty indeed. Also remember well that in all this instruction no word is wasted & that by deep & continuous study of the text may ye enlighten your souls. Now then at last are ye worthy to rule & govern the Rite in the Law of Righteousness & Truth; giving Light, Life, Liberty & Love to all who come forth keen and proud, royal and lofty, no matter of what age or faith or sex or race or worldly reputation, and solicit it of you."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" DE SANCTISSIMA TRINITATE The Most Holy Trinity, One & Indivisible, is hidden: By our Aryan brethren in the trigram AUM.

And herein is the reason thereof: every man is not a complete image of God in due proportion; & every woman is not a complete image of God in due proportion. Consider these words attentively, & understand what they say not. Our brethren in China, to confirm a bargain, break the stick on which it is written, each party keeping half, so that only on the fitting together of the two halves can the covenant be complete. So also is the Kingdom of Heaven. So also is this instruction. Unless the other half be in thy mind, thou wilt not understand. This then is the Covenant of the Creator, dividing that he may unite. In the Gospels of our brethren the Christians the Lord Jesus Christ is born of a woman called Mary and followed by a whore called Mary who becomes a vowed Virgin of the same name. These three also are one. So also is it written in the Book of the Law: For he is ever a sun, and she a moon. But to him is the winged secret flame, and to her the stooping starlight. In our Lord THERION is the Great Work accomplished. (Copy here Liber XXXVI.)

Study then the complete symbol; & howsoever thou mayest change, He changeth not. Go thou from the abyss to the abyss! Thou shalt find Him also Naught & always Many and always One & always ALL. Now, the complete symbol, as hath been said, is triune; yet often have the wise & holy men of old glyphed it as Two-in-One, leaving the third invisible. Such glyphs are the Point within the Circle, the Lingham-Yoni, the Rose & Cross, the divided Circle of the Chinese, the Cross within the Circle or the Diamond, the Spire & Nave of a Church, the triple & elevenfold cross in the invisible Diamond which a member of our Supreme Council prefixed to his signature, & many another. And of these symbols every one showeth forth the Work, the uniting in rapture of the divided.

And the Son is One, in the likeness of the Father, yet in his nature double, being God-Man. And in this Aeon is He known in Heaven (the Supernals) as Heru-ra-ha, and below the Abyss as THERION. And the Spirit is None and Two, and herein is Mystery: for She is not begotten but proceeding, and is in all and of all, the seed of which the Father & the Son are in very truth but vehicles & guardians. And above the Abyss is She known as NV and Binah, and below the Abyss as the Word and BABALON. For the Son is the Word, but the Word is the Spirit, & as the wind He-She goeth as it listeth Him-Her, to impregnate the worlds. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Yea, as the Son is double, so is the Spirit double; for He-She is both male & female. Isn’t the Dove the bird of Venus? Yet our ancient brother Marcus Valerius Martialis, that was Grand Orator of the Roman Empire in days of old hath hidden the Sacred Phallus in this image. He is the Mother, he is the Womb, He is the Sperm that fertilized the ovum; nay, but He is that fertilized & self-living thing which is nor sperm nor ovum, but their marriage, the Perfect Tincture, the Medicine of Metals, the Philosophical Stone, the Universal Medicine, the Elixir of Life. And in Its highest form is it known as the milk of the stars. He is that Dove that returning to the Ark of Noah bore a branch of olive; He is the Eagle of Jupiter, He is the Swan of Brahma; and in Her function of Guardian of the Abyss, He is also that mighty Devil CHORONZON, unto whom there is restriction in the Name of BABALON. From this omnipresence in form and ubiquity in function there hath sprung in minds confused by names or repressed by dogma or derived from unhealthy flesh much misapprehension of woman. For they understand not that although man is the transmitter of the Life of God, woman is the warden and keeper; indeed, as is written by our Lord THERION Himself in His Book of Wisdom or Folly, the Father is but the Alternator of the phases of the Mother. Is not Nu the hiding of Hadit? Is not Had the Manifestation of Nuit? Thus do they blaspheme who say woman hath no place in the Temple, or office in the Mass; led by the unhealth of their conditioning and upbringing, or the dis-ease of their bodies, they deny the Trinity Nuit-Hadit-Heru-ra-ha, restrict woman, froth folly, worship the ancient moon-god, resisting change and the New Aeon. Is not the word of Sin but Restriction? So saith the Lord of the Aeon: \"Let the woman be girt with a sword before me!\" Aye, for she is the equal counterpart of man. Moreover, the Holy Spirit is the Unity in the Trinity; for the Father & the Son are indeed the guardians of the Quintessence; but they are not the Quintessence itself. And this is of the Godhead; but on Earth it is the Son that combineth Father & Spirit, as it were Man & Woman, and therefore God & Man. Nor is this Mystery to be understanded of them that are not practised & perfect in this Means of Grace that is herein declared unto ye, O very dear & very illustrious & very illuminating Sisters & Brethren! Yet beware to forget that on the plane of flesh you must deal with men & women as it were with Sun & Moon. Therefore let men speak not of Nuit in Heaven a One, but as None; and on earth let them speak not of her at all, since the Spirit is continuous. This is also that which is written concerning the confusion of the space-marks in AL I 52 and concerning the Scarlet Woman in AL III 43-45. DE UNA SUBSTANTIA God in Spirit & Truth is One; & One also is God in Flesh & Illusion. O Sisters & Brethren! O Illuminating, O Illustrious Dames & Sir Knights, hold ths firmly as ye grip the sword-hilt in the hour of peril!

As God’s Essence abideth in Himself, so also with the Essence of man. Yet, not being himself wholly, but part of himself, this Essence is not wholly in him. It is found in perfection only without himself, & he can only attain it by virtue of the Sacrament of the Eucharist. DE CENA SUPREMA Quote John IV, 13-16, 31-32. John VI 27 & 48-58. John VII 38 I Corinthians X 1-4, 16-17, XI 23-30. The sacrament is administered under two kinds, Bread & Wine. Bread is solid, white, the fruit of the earth, the sustenance of man, the Body of Christ, the white Tincture. Wine is liquid, red, the fruit of the vine, the cordial of man, the Blood of Christ, the red Tincture. This divided sacrament is mortal; the Great Work is not accomplished therein. The life resideth not in flesh or in blood; & though it be the body & blood of God, it is not God; for God slain is not God re-arisen. Therefore, very Illustrious Dames & Sir Knights & my perfectly Illuminating Sisters & Brethren, I charge ye earnestly to understand that this sacrament of death availeth little. Ye must partake of the life of our Lord THERION in His function as the Risen Christ, Vice-Regent of Heru-ra-ha in this the Day of Vengeance of Hoor-Ra; & the Substance of the Sacrament will be the Elixir of Life itself. It will be One & not Two, neither male nor female, neither solid nor liquid. It will contain all possibilities, & without it no possibility could be. It is the Fire of Prometheus in the well-tended Lamp of Vesta; it is the Kneph of the Priests of Memphis, the disk of the Sun in the arms of Kephra; & the Serpent entwined about the Egg. Ask of our brethren the Alchemists, & of the Adepts of the Rosy Cross. The first answer: It is nothing but the Lion with his coagulated blood, & the gluten of the White Eagle; it is the Ocean wherein both Sun & Moon have bathed. The others: It is the dew upon the Rose that hath concealed the Cross. Ask of the Ancients: they reply that the oldest of the Gods is Saturn.

Third, be thou clothed in that One Vestment many-coloured which was bestowed upon thee at thine initiation. Now then, entering the privy chapel, do thou bestow at least one hour in adoration at the altar, exalting thyself in love toward God, & extolling God is strophe & antistrophe. Then do thou perform the Sacrifice of the Mass. The Elixir being then prepared solemnly & in silence, do thou consume it utterly. And in all this thou shalt direct thy whole will unwaveringly to the particular purpose of the Operation. Otherwise, have faith in God, that God may apportion its virtue to thy needs. This is the noblest way, & yet most dangerous; for thereby thou riskest profanation, eating & drinking damnation to thyself."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Be thou of good cheer, & strong in courage, no matter what may befall.

Remember also this, that to obtain the utmost from this Work thou needest experience & well-guided practice. Even as if thou sowest seeds in ignorance of seasons & of climates & of soils, some only may germinate, while the wise husbandman will reap all in perfect harvest, so do thou reflect that the Eucharist is of such nature that some result will follow, for the Grace of God cannot ever be balked, but may occasionally manifest itself in its other form, as God’s Wrath. And thus shalt thou be led to the Chapel of Abominations. Is it not written: fear not to undergo the curses? And, further: Fear not at all? And further: Behold where thine Angel hath led thee? Do thou then eat of the ripe or the unripe fruit without fear. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect. And those who would shun hate, and pain, and filth, and ugliness from their Vision of the Universe remain always little as it is written: They feel little; what is, is balanced by weak joys; but ye are my chosen ones. It is in the Chapel of Abominations, and none other, that thou shalt attain to the Sacrament of the Grail. Ask not then to have this Cup taken from thee! It is thy will, and none other, that hath led thee. This is not the will of all men. Where thou shalt eat & drink damnation to thyself, another shall see the palms of brilliance flower upon the island. So mote it be! Strive ever to more! Bacchus grew old, and was Silenus; Pan was ever Pan, for ever and ever more throughout the aeons. Therefore it is written: O Lord God! Let the haven be cast down by the fury of the storm!

CONTRA SEGNITATEM (A reproof delivered unto the Knights of the Temple by their Grand Master of the Order in their Church at Cambridge.) Sir Knights, Brethren & Comrades, recall the Vows of your Obedience. How is then that ye are ever dailying with dame or jousting with squire? By the eight pillars that support this holy house, it is not well, Sir Knights! Now ye know soothfast that our Law is Joy, that by virtue we deny not manhood, but in this ye err, that in your sport ye look not beyond to the Mighty Work of the vow. Is not this the essence of the Proof? The Substance of the Ordeal? Whether therefore ye foin or joust (as one of the Fathers of the Christians wrote in his Epistle), do all to the glory of God. Even at the moment when the device of the Demon grinneth at its strongest, play the man, aspire fervently toward the Word of our Lord THERION, considering the image of Jesus Christ, his crucifixion between two thieves (is not the lance that pierced Him in my charge?) & giving up the ghost unto the Father either by action or by passion. Say we not: \"thou hast no right but to do thy will?\" And in olden times: \"Accendat in noblis Dominem ignem sui amoris et flamman aeternae caritatis\"? That is to say: God’s purity in my body; & this is the Descending & Indwelling of the Holy Ghost. Nay, verily, Deus est Homo, Deus est in homine. Homo est Deus, quem creavit Elohim. Male & female are those therefore, as are these. Thus in this ye do well, & in this ill, for that ye arrest aspiration, ye suffocate & expire even at the moment when elsehow the Threshhold would be trodden & the Shrine unveiled. Behold, the spirit of the Lord is upon me & I prophesy! Unless ye repent, then will I the Lord root out your Order from its place. I the Lord will laugh at your calamity; I will mock where your fear cometh. Ye shall be the scorn of evil men, & your reproach shall be in the mouths of women.

And this is called the Hermetic Paradox; he that hath ears to hear, let him hear. There is no one Magick Art that leadeth into life, another that abutteth upon Death. And the first ultimateth; & the second returneth into itself. To reverse the whirlings of matter is occasionally as necessary as to work with them. Therefore is that last rite also perfect, a true rite of the Highest, but too exalted for the vulgar. In its profanation it cometh forth from the demon, & is manifested in all uncleanliness, even as it is written: Demon est Deus inversus. Yet were this to happen, even then do not fear. Fear not at all; but learn from your errors. Practice it only with those who have exchanged with you the true tokens & Word of Brotherhood. For if two mount one horse, and argue over where it should go, it were better to go on foot, or to ride alone. Albeit limited, & unable to proceed from life to life, it is the highest of all Means of Grace from our Lady, for it giveth true proportion and perspective of thy path, as it is written by our Lord THERION Himself concerning the letter H in His Book of Wisdom or Folly, Chapters 82 and 87; and in its other form it will exalt the Soul of Man, & whoso mastereth it is found worthy to rule. Of this our Lord also speaketh in his book Aleph, in Chapters 173, 174, 175 and 176. This was the secret of the strength of our Grand Master Caius Julius Caesar; of our Brother Richard Wagner that was Grand Organist in Bavaria; & of many others. It is the way of subtlety and of the serpent, as the other is of strength and the dove. Awake, my Lords, be vigilant; for they that seek to devour you are about this subtle gate. For they would climb to the Father (Chokmah) through the Path of the Son (Vau), eschewing the Horror of the Abyss and the bed of the Mother (Binah); and thus, fearing Death, they bow their necks to Her in servitude, worshiping the false moon (Mary). And they ever try to come in through the window when thou wouldst receive them at the door. Yet even these would reach the City of the Pyramids, were they but to come through the Door (Daleth); but they are wrapped in their false price, and blinded to their own misery. Of them it is that was written: There are purse-proud, penniless ones, that stand at the door of the tavern and revile the guests. Thus they worship the ancient Moon-God, the God Sin, whose word is Restriction; and they revile and fear Woman and seek to destroy Her. And thus they become Her slaves rather than Her Lord. But of all this let no more be here written; for this is the Book of the Pathway that leadeth unto Life. DE LEGE Love is the law, love under will. Is not AGAPE of one numeration with Thelema?
