The dispersion of the original secret wisdom having led to confusion, it was determined bythe Chiefs of all these Orders to recombine and centralize their activities, even as white light,divided in a prism, may be recomposed.It embodies the whole of the secret knowledge of all Oriental Orders; and its chiefs areinitiates of the highest rank, and recognized as such by all capable of such recognition inevery country in the world.In more remote times, the constituent originating assemblies of the O.T.O. included such menas:FohiHippolytusLaotzeMerlinSiddarthaArthurKrishnaTiturelTahutiAmfortasAnkh­f­n­khonsuPercivaleHeraklesMoshehOrpheusOdysseusVergiliusMohammedCatullusHermesMartialisPanApollonius TyanaeusDanteSimon MagusCarolus MagnusManesWilliam of SchyrenBasilidesFrederick of HohenstaufenValentinusRoger BaconBardesanesJacobus Burgundus MolensisKing WuKo HsuenChristian RosenkreutzOsirisUlrich von HuttenMelchizedekParacelsusKhemMichael MaierMenthuJakob BoehmeJohannes Dee"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Francis BaconSir Edward KellyAndreaThos.

The Order is international, and has existing branches in every civilized country of theworld.4. The aims of the O.T.O. can only be understood fully by its highest initiates; but it may besaid openly that it teaches Hermetic Science or Occult Knowledge, the Pure and HolyMagick of Light, the Secrets of Mystic attainment, Yoga of all forms, Gnana Yoga, RajaYoga, Bhakta Yoga and Hatha Yoga, and all other branches of the secret Wisdom of theAncients.In its bosom repose the Great Mysteries; its brain has resolved all the problems of philosophyand of life.It possesses the secret of the Stone of the Wise, of the Elixir of Immortality, and of theUniversal Medicine."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Moreover, it possesses a Secret capable of realizing the world­old dream of the Brotherhoodof Man.It also possesses in every important centre of poÿulation a hidden Retreat (Collegium adSpiritum Sanctum) where members may conceal themselves in order to pursue the GreatWork without hindrance.These houses are secret fortresses of Truth, Light, Power and Love, and their position is onlydisclosed under an oath of secrecy to those entitled to make use of them.They are also temples of true worship, specially consecrated by Nature to bring out of a manall that is best in him.5. The authority of the O.T.O. is concentrated in the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the Order), orFrater Superior. The name of the person occupying this office is never disclosed except to hisimmediate representatives.6. The Authority of the O.H.O. in all English­speaking countries is delegated by charter tothe Most Holy, Most Illustrious, Most Illuminated, and Most Puissant Baphomet X° RexSummus Sanctissimus 33°, 90°, 96°, Past Grand Master of the United States of America,Grand Master of Ireland, Iona, and All the Britains, Grand Master of the Knights of the HolyGhost, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Order of the Temple, Most Wise Sovereign ofthe Order of the Rosy Cross, Grand Zerubbabel of the Order of the Holy Royal Arch ofEnoch, etc. etc. etc., National Grand Master General ad vitam of the O.T.O.7. The National Grand Master General ad vitam is assisted by two principal officers, theGrand Treasurer General and the Grand Secretary General.There are many other officers, but they do not concern those to whom the present manifestois addressed.8. The whole of the Knowledge dispersed among the bodies mentioned in paragraph 2 hasbeen sifted and concentrated in the following degrees.OÿMinervalI°M.II°M. .III°M.∙.P.∙.M.∙.IV°Companion of the Holy Royal Arch of Enoch.Prince of Jerusalem.Knight of the East and of the West.Sovereign Prince of Rose Croix.

Every man and woman that is of full age, free, and of good report, has an indefeasible rightto the III°.Beyond this, admission is only granted by invitation from the governing body concerned.The O.T.O., although an Academia Masonica, is not a Masonic Body so far as the 'secrets'are concerned in the sense in which that expression is usually understood; and therefore in noway conflicts with, or infringes the just privileges of, the United Grand Lodge of England, orany Grand Lodge in America or elsewhere which is recognized by it.10. Application for admission to the Order may be made personally at headquarters, betweenthe hours of Ten A.M. and Twelve Noon on week­days, or by letter to the Grand SecretaryGeneral. In the former case, applicants should be provided with the Twenty Dollars entitlingthem to the Third Degree; in the latter, it should be enclosed with the application.The First Annual Subscription is payable on taking the Third Degree; if this is taken afterJune 30 in any year, only half the amount is due.Subscriptions of old members are due on January 1, but the Brother is considered in goodstanding, and he does not lose his rights, if it is paid by March 1. Should he fail to dischargehis obligation by this date, he ceases ipso facto to be a member of the Order, but may bereinstated on paying arrears and Five Dollars extra. If his lapse extend to the next yearfollowing, he can only be reinstated under special conditions, and by the express consent inwriting of the National Grand Master General ad vitam.11.

Besides the free certificate of membership, special diplomas for framing are granted to allmembers at a uniform price of Ten Dollars. Special diplomas of the IX°, Twenty­five Dollars.13. The privileges of members of the O.T.O. are very numerous. These are the principal:1. They have not only access to, but instruction in, the whole body of hidden knowledgepreserved in the Sanctuary from the beginning of its manifestation.In the lower grades the final secrets are hinted and conveyed in symbol, beneath veil,and through sacrament.In this way the intelligence of the initiate is called into play, so that he who well usesthe knowledge of the lower grades may be selected for invitation to the higher, whereall things are declared openly.2. They become partakers of the current of Universal Life in Liberty, Beauty, Harmony,and Love which flames within the heart of the O.T.O., and the Light of that augustfraternity insensibly illuminates them ever more and more as they approach its centralSun.3. They meet those persons most complemental to their own natures, and find unexpectedhelp and brotherhood in the whole world wherever they may travel.4. They obtain the right to sojourn in the secret houses of the O.T.O., permanently or fora greater or lesser period of the year according to their rank in the Order; or, in the caseof those of the Fifth and lower degrees, are candidates for invitation to these houses.5. The Knowledge of the Preparation and Use of the Universal Medicine is restricted tomembers of the IX°; but it may be administered to members of the VIII° and VII° inspecial circumstances by favour of the National Grand Masters General, and even inparticular emergency to members of lower degrees.6. In the V° all members are pledged to bring immediate and perfect relief to all distress ofmind, body, or estate, in which they may find any of their fellows of that degree. In thehigher degrees the Bonds of Fraternity are still further strengthened. The Order thusaffords a perfect system of insurance against every misfortune or accident of life.7. Members of the IX° become part proprietors of the Estates and Goods of the Order, sothat the attainment of this degree implies a return with interest of the fees andsubscriptions paid.8. The Order gives practical assistance in life to worthy members of even its lowerdegrees, so that, even if originally poor, they become well able to afford thecomparatively high fees of the VII°, VIII°, and IX°. On exaltation to the IV° eachCompanion may file an account of his circumstances, and state in what direction herequires help.14. In selecting members for advancement, attention is paid to their devotion to the Order, totheir intelligence in apprehending the nature of its teaching, to their zeal in spreading theprinciples of the Order so far as they themselves understand them, though always with the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"discretion inseparable from the due guarding of the secrets, and to all those qualities ofcourage, honour, and virtue without which man is not worthy of that name.15. The O.H.O. is only known to members of the VIII° and IX°.The National Grand Master General ad vitam is not approachable as such by any person whohas not reached the VI°.All communications should be addressed to the Grand Secretary General, and all chequesdrawn in favour of the Grand Treasurer General.Issued by Order,L.
