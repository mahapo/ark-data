The object of this course of reading is to familiarize the student with all that has beensaid by the Great Masters in every time and country. He should make a criticalexamination of them; not so much with the idea of discovering where truth lies, for hecannot do this except by virtue of his own spiritual experience, but rather to discover theessential harmony in those varied works. He should be on his guard against partisanshipwith a favourite author. He should familiarize himself thoroughly with the method ofmental equilibrium, endeavouring to contradict any statement soever, although it maybe apparently axiomatic. The general object of this course, besides that already stated, is to assure soundeducation in occult matters, so that when spiritual illumination comes it may find awell-built temple. Where the mind is strongly biased towards any special theory, theresult of an illumination is often to inflame that portion of the mind which is thusoverdeveloped, with the result that the aspirant, instead of becoming an Adept, becomesa bigot and fanatic.
