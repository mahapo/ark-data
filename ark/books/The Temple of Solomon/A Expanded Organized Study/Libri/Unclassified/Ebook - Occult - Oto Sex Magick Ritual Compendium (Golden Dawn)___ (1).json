This is a list of works which I consider useful to a greater or lesser extent in studying the O.T.O. material. Generally the original edition, and the current edition (if one exists) or most recent reprint are cited. The bibliography of the works of Aleister Crowley is not humanly possible if one includes pirate and small press editions, which proliferated in the 1970s and 1980s. For works which have remained in print continuously or semi-continuously to the present, the date given is that of the first printing of the currently available edition. A few of the following are seriously rare and fetch high prices on the second-hand market when they do appear for sale. Abraham ben Simeon of Worms (attrib.; trans. & ed.

"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"On the Supreme Secret of the OTO Warning There is a reason that this information is \"secret.\" The techniques described in here are considered by some to be very powerful, and if attempted without some knowledge and common sense, a person could quickly find himself on the losing end of Natural Selection. I suggest spending about a decade reading the information available and practicing some of the rituals in those texts daily. Remember, something that is extremely powerful when used correctly is also extremely powerful when used by idiots. Think of the atomic bomb before you consider practicing this technique. There are several good books available that contain more information, such as Ecstasy Through Tantra. Read, and practice simple things before jumping in head first. Chastity The first step to performing the ritual is to be chaste. This is not the typical version of chastity, but one slightly augmented. Using techniques available in Liber Jugorum, the aspirant must cease all thoughts about sex. This has the effect of making the act sacrosanct. Preparation This mainly involves creating a ritual atmosphere. The robe should be worn, and the priestess or priest (whomever you are working with) should invoke, or have invoked within him/her, the desired god. For practical reasons, this should default to Nuit, Hadit, or Ra-Hoor-Kuit. Typically a male would have his priestess invoke Nuit. Once the ritual space is prepared, the magician should enter the temple/room and pay homage to the god. This involves such acts that would normally constitute forplay. Liber Stellae Rubae describes acts involving drugs and vanilla forms of sado-masochism. I don't suggest the former, as it introduces uncontrollable factors, especially in the works of a beginner. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Sex Just what it says. Have sex with the god, uniting in bliss. When finished, having taken at least an hour, imbibe the mixture of fluids that results. \"For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all.\" - CCXX I:29-30 The Trick If only it were that simple. Actually, it is. However, the magician must keep his mind toward his goal, often with a sigil. It sounds easy enough, but a strong will is needed to focus during orgasm. An Alternative Before imbibing the liquid, it is also useful to consecrate a prepared sigil with some of the fluid. This is then burned and forgotten, another trick from Liber Jugorum. This step is not always necessary. Why it's not a secret This practice has existed, give or take the imbibing part, for centuries. As a matter of fact, it is described in a book by Mosheh Idel where he talks about the Kabbalist aspiring to the divine. Therefore, I see no harm in presenting the minimal amount of material here on this page. \"It is well known to the masters of Kabbalah that human thought stems from the intellectual soul, which descends from above. And human thought has the ability to strip itself [of alien things] and to ascend and arrive at the place of its source. Then it unites with the supernal entity, whence it comes and it [the thought] and it [its source] becomes one entity. . . . Our ancient sages stated that when the husband copulates with his wife, and his thought unites with the supernal entities, that very thought draws teh supernal light downward, and it [the light] dwells upon that very drop [of semen] upon which he directs his intention and thinks upon . . . that this very drop is permanently linked with the brilliant light . . . as the thought on it [the drop] was linked to the supernal entities, and it draws the brilliant light downward.\" -Kabbalah: New Perspectives, Moshe Idel (a quote on page 52) "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"How to make it stronger This ritual definately benefits from the ability to raise what is known as Kundalini. All the chakrum of the participants should be activated, allowing the crown chakra to blossom. Needless to say, this has the effect of increasing the potency of the ritual. It must be understood, however, that the magick is said to be effective without this bit. Just the act of sex itself contains some potency, and don't be fooled by the simple nature of this information. Is this Thelemic? The answer to this question must be a resounding, No. Information contained in the Book of the Law and the Book of Lies insinuates that Thelemic sex magick involves a different sex act. In laymen's terms it is called the \"69.\" There is no claim by the OTO that the form of sex magick practiced by the advanced members is a Thelemic form, only that the order itself espouses Thelemic ideals. Therefore, there is no contradiction. Following are some quotes that elucidate the nature of Thelemic sex magick. I have not commented upon them since I believe them to be fairly lucid. I have, however, italicized those parts which the reader should take special care in examining.

Any occasion requiring interpretation, elaboration or innovation shall be biased toward the physical safety of the candidate. When an initiation ritual appears to call for a potentially dangerous situation, the ritual shall be followed as written, but with sufficient and attentive concern for physical safety.” The following criteria were suggested to assist Initiators in assuring the safety of their candidates and to provide a uniform standard for the development of local safety policies. I. Temple furniture A) The Well. The Well shall be no smaller than three and a half feet in each dimension. If your Well is smaller than this, build a new one. The interior of the Well shall be smooth, with no projecting bolts, nails or fixtures, and shall contain no foreign objects, such as bottles or cups, while the candidate is entering, within or leaving the Well. The water in the Well shall be no less than 24 inches deep in the II°, and shall have a minimum of 10 inches of clear air space at the top in the I° Some candidates (and some of the larger Wells) may require a steady footstool or movable steps to facilitate ingress and egress. The candidate must never be shoved, stuffed or otherwise forced into the Well. A good technique in the II° is to have the candidate stand on a relatively high (but stable) footstool so that his or her centre of gravity is positioned above the edge of the Well. Do what you can to minimize the overall effort of getting the candidate into the Well. It should be done quickly and smoothly, with a minimum of motion and a minimum of splash.

Disinfection may be accomplished by draining the Well, sponging its interior surfaces with a dilute solution of chlorine bleach, then drying it thoroughly. Caution: never mix bleach with other cleaning products, especially products that contain ammonia; the mixture can generate highly toxic fumes. B. The Hoodwink and Ties. Candidates shall not be moved up or down stairs while bound. In taking blindfolded candidates up or down stairs, the escorting officer shall always be below the candidate, to catch the candidate in case of a slip. This officer must be strong enough to catch a falling candidate. Candidates shall not be spun around, rough-housed, yelled at or otherwise hazed or disoriented while they are bound and blindfolded. C. The Noose. The I° noose, along with the grip applied to the candidate’s throat during the I° oath, shall not be applied in such a way as to restrict the candidate’s breathing or circulation. The throat grip shall be performed using firm, but gentle, pressure with one hand. All other methods of applying this grip are prohibited. The noose shall be made in such a way that the candidate can loosen it by him/herself if necessary. D. The Dagger and Swords. All daggers and swords used in O.T.O. rituals shall be ceremonial, that is, they shall have dull edges and slightly blunted points. When a dagger is held to a candidate’s throat, it shall not be pointed directly at the Candidate’s throat, but slightly off to the side; such that injury will be avoided if the candidate should stumble forward. Daggers and swords shall not be used to actually threaten anybody, including candidates, strangers, fellow temple officers, neighbours, police, etc.. E. The Floor. Sponges or old towels shall be on hand in the I° and II° rituals to keep the floor dry enough to prevent slippage. Keep travelled areas clear, especially for blindfolded candidates. F. Weights. The III° weights should be assembled on some sort of harness which transfers most of the weight to the hips or legs. Avoid overstressing the shoulders and back. Backpacks with hip belts, weight belts designed for scuba diving, and velcro-fastened wrist and ankle weights may be useful. Some of the weights may be attached by wide straps to the candidate’s legs and allowed to drag behind the candidate. Under no circumstances are weights to be attached such that they are supported by"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"the head or neck. Under no circumstances are weights to be attached directly to the candidate with cords or straps less than one inch wide. Not all candidates can safely carry the full 156 pounds. Use your best judgement to decide what the actual load will be. An officer should be ready to assist by removing some of the weights if the candidate shows signs of excessive stress at any time during the ceremony. Take care unloading the weights as well as loading them; watch the candidate’s toes. F. The Bitter Draught. The use of locally illegal substances is prohibited. G. The Scourge. Don’t get overly realistic. Stay away from the Candidate’s face, and try not to induce any effects which would last more than a few hours. H. The Stones. If real stones are used, do not throw them; a firm, but gentle, tap will do. I. Fire Extinguisher. A fully charged fire extinguisher of the proper type shall be easily accessible in all O.T.O. rituals where candles and other open flames are present. Officers shall be informed of its location and briefed on how to use it prior to commencement of the ceremony. II. Officers The officers in an O.T.O. ritual must be alert and capable of acting rationally and quickly in an emergency. Therefore, officers shall take extreme care that these abilities are not impeded before or during a ritual. Officers shall not participate in initiation rituals while intoxicated. III. Candidates Ask each candidate about any health problems, chronic or otherwise. A quick review of their application forms may assist in this. Some candidates may require special care during their initiation; for instance, diabetics and hypo-glycemics should have access to some food of their own choosing. Candidates who wear glasses or contact lenses should remove them prior to a II° ceremony. Recovering alcoholics may require special consideration in the II° and III°. Some candidates may be physically unfit to participate in some initiation ceremonies. If the Initiator judges this to be the case, it is the Initiator’s duty to defer the initiation of such a candidate. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Factors which may cause a candidate to be physically unfit for initiation include, but are not limited to: extreme obesity, severe hypertension, a serious illness or injury that is not fully healed, pregnancy, chronic back problems, chronic respiratory problems, chronic heart problems, haemophilia, and epilepsy. None of the above factors necessarily demand deferral of the candidate’s initiation, there may be mitigating circumstances. IV. Weather Conditions In cold weather, candidates in I° and II° initiations must be dried off promptly after leaving the Well. V. First Aid It is wise to have a commercial first aid kit available to treat minor cuts and scrapes. For more major injuries, administer first aid only if you absolutely know what you are doing. If you don’t know what you are doing, call the paramedics or the hospital. Have the phone number handy. Chartered Initiators are encouraged to take formal first aid training. First aid training programs are often available at colleges, junior colleges, and community centres. VI. Closing Remarks Obviously, these criteria are incomplete. Simply following the instructions above to the letter will not guarantee the safety of your Candidates, or relieve you of the responsibility to ensure their safety. Use your brain, and take a little extra time at each initiation to think about safety. Notes for Music in the Man of Earth Degrees The following notes are intended as suggestions and guidelines to initiators in the Man of Earth series with regard to musical performance in these ceremonies. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law It has been understood from primitive times that music in ritual can be of a tool of tremendous power. Appropriate places have been indicated by Baphomet in the Man of Earth rituals for the use of Music, but unfortunately, Baphomet gave no indications of appropriate music. It"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"therefore becomes my privilege to make a few suggestions about the implementation of Music in these rituals. It is to be understood that every centre of initiation in the Order will be differently endowed in respect to musical talent; therefore, no one musical practice can possibly be suited to everybody. That being said, it is my first recommendation that whenever possible, music that is created within the ritual is preferable to recorded music. Nevertheless, there will certainly be cases where recorded music is a matter of practical necessity. It goes without saying in such cases that the sound equipment should be the best available, and the tapes should be carefully cued so that they will cause the least distraction possible in the ritual. The list of suggestions presented here is by no means exhaustive, and initiators using recorded music may have selections which they favour over these; in such cases, I would be pleased to hear of these, and to consider them for future revisions of this list. For I°, I recommend the following pieces in cases where a recording is necessary: Gustav Holst: “Neptune” from The Planets Ralph Vaughan Williams: Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis W. A. Mozart: Great Mass in c minor, “Et incarnatus est” Music is not as necessary in II° as in I° or III°, but could certainly be a useful adjunct to the other festivities of the “siesta of noon”. (Care must obviously be taken that music does -not prevent the Candidate from hearing everything that is going on!) Possible choices for music in the II° include: Leos Janacek: Sinfonietta Gustav holst: “Jupiter” From The Planets Bela Bartok: Concerto for Orchestra, Finale For III°, appropriate musical choices of great beauty are numerous. Here are a few suggestions: W. A. Mozart: Mauerisches Trauermusik Paul Hindemith: Trauermusik Richard Strauss: Tod und Verklarung, opening section (before Allegro) Mahler: Symphony #2, First Movement (Coda) Samuel Barber: Adagio for Strings The last piece mentioned is, in the opinion of this writer, one of the most eloquent musical -representations of the Trance of Sorrow ever conceived."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"In III° particularly, it is desirable to select an excerpt which can be heard in its entirety. In light of the appendix on safety in these rituals, that involves both careful timings of the excerpts selected, and nearly clairvoyant estimation of the physical stamina of the candidate. Needless to say, the safety of the candidate must always come first. Now to the issue of live music in these rituals: it is my earnest desire to see the development of a living tradition of musical chant associated with these rituals. The chant-tunes which I am enclosing here are an experimental step towards such a tradition. Naturally, the use of these pieces is not obligatory, but trying then is highly recommended. So is feedback to me about how they worked for you. Both of these chants may be sung as rounds (the roman numerals indicate entrances) and should, where possible, also involve one or more voices carrying the drone (the “Aum” pitch at the beginning). ABIDE WITH ME The above chant should obviously have a heavier, more mournful rhythm than that of the I° This melody is based upon the “Dies irae” section of the Gregorian Requiem Mass (the. Mass for the Dead). it is probably more closely associated with the idea of death than any single phrase in musical history. In learning these chants, it is suggested that at least one session be devoted to rehearsal. The text itself should be thoroughly memorized, and the tune sung in unison several times before attempting any part singing. Pay close attention to the unusual scale patterns used in each chant; it maybe that a piano or guitar playing the melody the first few times will be very helpful. As the cantors become more fluent with the material, it is to be hoped that a trance state is the natural outcome of time devoted to this musical practice; when this occurs, it may be confidently expected to repeat itself during the ritual proper. Love is the law, love under will.
