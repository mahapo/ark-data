We are most of us aware that cabinet ministers, bishops, and dons resembleeach other in the important particular that all are still schoolboys, andtheir differences but the superficial one produced by greasing, soaping, andwithering them respectively; so that it will meet with instant generalapproval if I open this paper by the remark that Christianity, as long as itflourished, was content to assimilate Paganism, never attacking it until itsown life had been sapped by the insidious heresies of Pall. Time passed by, and they bullied Manes and Cerinthus; history repeateditself until it almost knew itself by heart; finally, at the present day,some hireling parasites of the decaying faith -- at once the origin and theproduct of that decay -- endeavour to take advantage of the \"Greek movement\"or the \"Neo-pagan revival\" in the vain hope of diverting the public attentionfrom the phalanx of Rationalism -- traitorously admitted by Luther, and nowsitting crowned and inexpugnable in the very citadel of the faith -- to theirown dishonest lie that Paganism was a faith whose motto was \"Carpediem,\"<<\"Gather ye roses!\" is the masterpiece of a Christian clergyman. --A.C.>> and those methods were drink, Dance, and Studio Murder.<<A perculiarlygross case of psychopathic crime which occurred in 1906.>> Why is Procopiuscleaner than Petronius? Even a Julian could confute this sort of thing; butare we to rest for ever in negation? No; a Robinson minimus ipse will turn,and it is quite time that science was given a chance to measure itselfagainst bulk. I shall not be content with giving Christian apologists thelie direct, but proceed to convict them of the very materialism against whichthey froth. In a word, {220A} to-day Christianity is the irreligion of thematerialist, or if your like, the sensualist; while in Paganism, we may findthe expression of that ever-haunting love -- nay, necessity! -- of the Beyondwhich tortures and beautifies those of us who are poets. GR:pi-alpha-nu-tau-alpha kappa-alpha-theta-alpha-rho-alpha tau-omicron-iota-sigma kappa-alpha-theta-alpha-rho-omicron-iota-sigma -- and, while thereis no logical break between the apparently chaste dogma of the Virgin Birthand the horrible grossness of R. P. Sanchez in his \"De Matrimonio,\" Lib. ii.Cap. xxi., \"Utium Virgo Maria semen emiserit in copulatione cum SpirituSancto,\" so long as we understand an historical Incarnation: theaccomplishment of that half of the Magnum Opus which is glyphed in the mystic"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"aphorism \"Solve!\" enables an Adept of that standing to see nothing but puresymbol and holy counsel in the no grosser legends of the Greeks. This is nota matter of choice: reason forbids us to take the Swan-lover in its literalsilliness and obscenity; but, on the other hand, the Bishops will not allowus to attach a pure interpretation to the precisely similar story of theDove.<<Recently, a certain rash doctor publicly expressed his doubts whetherany Bishop of the twentieth century was so filthy-minded a fool. They were,however, soon dispelled by telegrams from a considerable section of theentire Bench, couched in emphatic language.>> So far am I, indeed, from attacking Christian symbolism as such, that I amquite prepared to admit that it is, although or rather because it is thelowest, the best. Most others, especially Hinduism and Buddhism, losethemselves in metaphysical speculations only proper to those who are alreadyAdepts. The Rosicrucian busies himself with the Next Step, for himself and hispupils; he is no more concerned to discuss Nibbana than a schoolmaster to\"settle the doctrine of the enclithic GR:Delta-eta\" in the mind of a childwho is painfully grappling with the declension of GR:Nu-epsilon-alpha-nu-iota-alpha-sigma. We can read even orthodox {220B} Christian writers withbenefit (such is the revivifying force of our Elixir) by seeking the essencein the First Matter of the Work; and we could commend many of them, notablySt. Ignatius and even the rationalising Mansel and Newman, if they would onlyconcentrate upon spiritual truth, instead of insisting on the truth ofthings, material and therefore immaterial, which only need the touch of ascholar's wand to crumble into the base dust from which their bloodstainedtowers arose. Whoso has been crucified with Christ can but laugh when it is proved thatChrist was never crucified. The historian understands nothing of what wemean, either by Christ or by crucifixion, and is thus totally incompetent tocriticise our position. On the other hand, we are of course equally ill-placed to convert him; but then we do not wish to do so; certainly not \"qua\"historian. We leave him alone. Whoso hath ears to hear, let him hear! andthe first and last ordeals and rewards of the Adept are comprised in themaxim \"Keep silence!\" There should be no possible point of contact between the Church and theworld: Paul began the ruin of Christianity, but Constantine completed it.The Church which begins to exteriorise is already lost. To control theethics of the state is to adopt the ethics of the state: and the first dutyof the state will be to expel the rival god Religion. In such a cycle we inEngland seem to be now revolving, and the new forced freedom of the Church isupon us. If only the destruction is sufficiently complete, if only all England willturn Atheist, we may perhaps be able to find some Christians here and there.As long as \"church\" means either a building, an assembly, or even has anymeaning at all of a kind to be intelligible to the ordinary man, so long isChrist rejected, and the Pharisee supreme."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Now the materialism which has always {221A} been the curse of Christianitywas no doubt partly due to the fact that the early disciples were poor men.You cannot bribe a rich man with loaves and fishes: only the overfed longfrom the Simple Life. True, Christ bought the world by the promise of Fastsand Martyrdoms, glutted as it was by its surfeit of Augustan glories; but thepoor were in a vast majority, and snatched greedily at all the grosspleasures and profits of which the educated and wealthy were sick even untodeath. Further, the asceticism of surfeit is a false passion, and only lastsuntil a healthy hunger is attained; so that the change was an entirecorruption, without redeeming aspect. Had there been five righteous men inRome, a Cato, a Brutus, a Curtius, a Scipio, and a Julian, nothing would haveoccurred; but there was only the last, and he too late. No doubt Maximus,his teacher, was too holy an Adept to mingle in the affairs of the world; oneindeed, perhaps, about to pass over to a higher sphere of action: suchspeculation is idle and impertinent; but the world was ruined, as neverbefore since the fabled destruction of Atlantis, and I trust that I shalltake my readers with me when I affirm so proud a belief in the might of theheart whose integrity is unassailable, clean of all crime, that I lay it downas a positive dictum that only by the decay in the mental and moral virilityof Rome and not otherwise, was it possible for the slavish greed and anarchyof the Faith of Paul to gain a foothold. This faith was no new current ofyouth, sweeping away decadence: it was a force of the slime: a force with nosingle salutary germ of progress inherent herein. Even Mohammedanism, sooften accused of materialism, did produce, at once, and in consequence, arevival of learning, a crowd of algebraists, astronomers, philosophers, whosenames are still to be revered: but within the fold, from the death of Christto the Renaissance -- a purely pagan movement -- we hear no more {221B} ofart, literature, or philosophy.<<Such philosophy as does exist is entirelyvicious, taking its axioms no more from observed fact, but from \"Scripture\"or from Aristotle. Barring such isolated pagans as M. Aurelius Antoninus,and the neo-Platonists, those glorious decadents* of paganism. * Decadence marks the period when the adepts, nearing their earthlyperfection, become true adepts, not mere men of genius. They disappear,harvested by heaven: and perfect darkness (apparent death) ensues until theyouthful forerunners of the next crop begin to shoot in the form of artists.Diagramatically: T H E I N V I S I B L E .  . .---------------------------------..-------.-------------------------.------. : T H E V I S I B L E . : : S .:^: S . : : T .:|: T . : : : P .:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"|: P . : : : E .:S: E . : : : D .:p: D . : : : A .

There is surely a positive side to all this; we agree that Pagans musthave been more spiritual than their successors, if only because themselvesopenly scoffed at their mythology without in the least abandoning the devoutperformance of its rites, while the Christian clung to irrelevant historicalfalsehood as if it were true and important. But it is justifiable -- nay,urgent -- to inquire how and why? Which having discovered, we are bound toproceed with the problem: \"Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?\"receive the answer: \"By taking heed thereto according {222A} to thy word,\"and interpret \"thy word\" as \"The Works of Aleister Crowley.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" But this is to anticipate; let us answer the first question by returningto our phrase \"The Church that exteriorises is already lost.\" On thathypothesis, the decay of Paganism was accomplished by the very outward andvisible sign of its inward and spiritual grace, the raising of massivetemples to the Gods in a style and manner to which history seeks in vain aparallel. Security is mortals' chiefest enemy; so also the perfection ofbalanced strength which enabled Hwang-sze to force his enemies to build theGreat Wall was the mark of the imminent decay of his dynasty and race --truly a terrible \"Writing on the Wall.\" An end to the days of the NineSages; an end to the wisdoms of Lao Tan on his dun cow; an end to the makingof classics of history and of odes and of ethics, to the Shu King and theShih King, and the Li-Ki, {222B} and the mysterious glories of the holy YiKing itself! Civilisation, decadence, and the slime. Still the Great Wallkeeps the Barbarians from China: it is the wall that the Church of Christ setup against science and philosophy, and even to-day its ruins stand, albeitwrapped in the lurid flames of Hell. It is the law of life, this cycle;decadence is perfection, and the perfect soul is assumed into the bosom ofNephthys, so that for a while the world lies fallow. It is in failing to seethis constant fume of incense rising from the earth that pessimisticphilosophies make their grand fundamental error: in that, and in assuming thevery point in dispute, the nature of the laws of other worlds and theprospects of the individual soul. Confess, O subtle author, that thouthyself art even now in the same trap! Willingly, reader; these slips happenwhen, although one cannot prove to others, one knows.<<Let me run wild foronce, I beg; I am tired of emulating Mr. Storer Clouston's Sir JulianWallingford, \"whose reasoning powers were so remarkable that he nevercommitted the slightest action without furnishing a full and adequateexplanation of his conduct.\" -- A. C.>> Thou too shall know, and thou wilt:-- ask how, and we come suddenly back to our subject, just as a dreamer maywander through countless nightmares, to find himself in the end on the top ofa precipice, whence falling, he shall find himself in bed. Hear wisdom! the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind. A man is almost obliged to be in communion with God when God is blowinghis hat off, drenching him to the skin, whistling through his very bones,scaring him almost to death with a flash of lightning, and so on. When hegets time to think, he thinks just that. In a church all is too clearly thework of man: in the matter of man's comfort man's devices are so obviouslysuperior to God's: so that we compare hats and languidly discuss thepreacher. Religion is alive in Wales, because people have to walk miles to chapel.{223A} Religion is alive among Mohammedans, who pray (as they live) out of doors,and who will fight and die for their ideas; and among Hindus, whose bloodysacrifices bring them daily face to face with death. Pan-Islam is possible; pan-Germany is possible; but pan-Christendom wouldbe absurd. There were saints in the times of the Crusades, and Crusaders in"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the times of the Saints: for though the foe was more artificial than real,and the object chimerical, a foe and an aim of whatever sort assist theconcentration which alone is life. So that we need not be surprised to see as we do that religion is dead inLondon, where it demands no greater sacrifice than that of an hour's leisurein the week, and even offers to repay that with social consideration for theold, and opportunities of flirtation for the young. The word \"dear\" has two senses, and these two are one. Pressing the \"out-of-doors\" argument, as we may call it, I will challengeeach of my readers to a simple experiment. Go out one night to a distant an lonely heath, if no mountain summit isavailable: then at midnight repeat the Lord's Prayer, or any invocation withwhich you happen to be familiar, or one made up by yourself, or oneconsisting wholly of senseless and barbarous words.<<I am ashamed to say thatI have devoted considerable time to the absurd task of finding meanings for,and tracing the corruptions of, the \"barbarous names of evocation\" whichoccur in nearly all conjurations, and which Zoroaster warns his pupils not tochange, because \"they are names divine, having in the sacred rites a powerineffable.\" The fact is that many such names are indeed corruptions of divine names.We may trace Eheieh in Eie, Abraxas in Abrae, Tetragrammaton in Jehovah. But this, an initiate knows, is quite contrary to the true theory. It is \"because\" the names are senseless that they are effective. If a manis really praying he cannot bring himself to utter ridiculous things to hisGod, just as Mark Twain observes that one \"cannot pray a lie.\" So that it isa sublime test of faith to utter either a lie or a jest, this with reverence,and that with conviction. Achieve it; the one becomes the truth, the other aformula of power. Hence the real value of the Egyptian ritual by which thetheurgist identified himself with the power he invoked. Modern neophytesshould not (we think) use the old conjurations with their barbarous names,because, imperfectly understanding the same, they may superstitiouslyattribute some real power to them; we shall rather advise \"Jack and Jill wentup the hill,\" \"From Greenland's icy mountains,\" and such, with which it isimpossible for the normal mind to associate a feeling of reverence. What may be the mode of operation of this formula concerns us little;enough if it succeeds. But one may suggest that it is a case of the willrunning free, \"i.e.\" unchecked, as it normally is, by the hosts of criticallarvae we call reason, habit, sensation, and the like. But the will freed from these may run straight and swift; if its habitualgoal has been the attainment of Samadhi, it may under such circumstancesreach it. It will require a very advanced student to use this type of faith.The Lord's Prayer and the minor exaltation are the certainties for thisevent. -- A. C.>> Repeat it solemnly and {223B} aloud, expectant of somegreat and mysterious result. I pledge myself, if you have a spark of religion in you, that is, if youare properly a human being, that you will (at the very least) experience a"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"deeper sense of spiritual communion that you have ever obtained by any courseof church-going. After which you will, if you are worth your salt, devote your life to thedevelopment of this communion, and to the search for an instructed master whocan tell you more than I can. Now the earlier paganism is simply overflowing with this spirit ofcommunion. The boy goes down to the pool, musing, as boys will; is itstrange that a nymph should reward him, sometimes even with wine from thepurple vats of death? Poor dullards! in your zeal to extinguish the light upon our altars youhave had to drench your own with the bitter waters of {224A} most generalunbelief. Where are the witches and the fairies and the angels, and thevisions of the divine St. John? You are annoyed at my mention of angels andwitches; because you know yourselves to be sceptics, and that I have anyamount of \"scriptural warrant\" to throw at your heads, if I deigned; you areall embarassed when Maude Adams leans over the footlights with a goo-gooaccent so excessive that you die of diabetes in a week, and asks you point-blank: \"Do you believe in fairies?\" while, for your visions, you do not go toSt. John's Island, and share his exile; but to his Wood, and waste yourmoney. The early pagan worships Demeter in dim groves; there is silence; there isno organisation of ritual; there the worship is spontaneous and individual.In short, the work of religion is thrown upon the religious faculty, insteadof being delegated to the quite inferior and irrelevant faculties of meredecorum or even stage-craft. A Christian of the type of Browning understandsthis perfectly. True, he approves the sincerity which he finds to pervadethe otherwise disgusting chapel; but he cares nothing whatever for the\"raree-show of Peter's successor,\" and though I daresay his ghost will beshocked and annoyed by my mention of the fact, Browning himself does not gethis illumination in any human temple, but only when he is out with theuniverse alone in the storm. Nor does Browning anywhere draw so perfect and so credible a picture ofthe intercourse between man and God as the exquisite vision of Pan in\"Pheidippides.\" It is all perfectly natural and therefore miraculous; thereis no straining at the gnats of vestment in the hope of swallowing the camelof Illumination. In the matter of Pentecost, we hear only, in the way of the \"conditions ofthe experiment,\" that \"they were all with one accord in one place.\" Now,this being {224B} the only instance in the world's history of more than twopeople in one place being of one accord, it is naturally also the onlyinstance of a miracle which happened in church. The Quakers, arguing soundly enough that women were such a cause ofcontention chiefly on account of their tongues, and getting a glimpse ofthese truths which I have so laboriously been endeavouring to expound, hopedfor inspiration from the effects of silence alone, and strove (even by asymbolic silence in costume) to repeat the experiment of Pentecost."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" But they lacked the stimulus of Syrian air, and that of the stirring timesof the already visible sparks of national revolt: they should have sought toreplace these by passing the bottle round in their assemblies, and somethingwould probably have happened, an 'twere only a raid of the police.

Better be a Shaker, or a camp-meeting homunculus, or a Chataqua gurl, or aKeswick week lunatic, or an Even Roberts revivalist, or even a common maniac,than a smug Evangelical banker's clerk with a greasy wife and three giftedchildren -- to be bank clerks after him! Better be a flagellant, or one who dances as David danced before the Lord,than a bishop who is universally respected, even by the boys he used to bastewhen he was headmaster of a great English public school! That is, if religion is your aim: if you are spiritually minded: if youinterpret every phenomenon that is presented to your sensorium as aparticular dealing of God with your soul. But if you come back from the celebration of the Eucharist and say, \"Mr.Hogwash was very dull to-day,\" you will never get to heaven, where the goodpoets live, and nobody else; nor to hell, whose inhabitants are exclusivelybad poets. {225A} There is more hope for a man who should go to Lord's and say he saw theangels of God ascending and descending upon C. B. Fry. It is God who sees the possibility of Light in Chaos; it is the Churcheswho blaspheme the superb body of Truth which Adepts of old enshrined in theCross, by degrading the Story of the Crucifixion to a mere paragraph in the\"Daily Mail\" of the time of Pontius Pilate. Bill Blake took tea with Ezekiel: Tennyson saw no more in the Arthurianlegends than a prophecy of the Prince Consort (though Lancelot has little incommon with John Brown), and the result of all is that Tennyson is dead andburied -- as shown by the fact that he is still popular -- and Blake lives,for poets read and love him. Now when Paganism became popular, organised, state-regulated, it ceased tobe individual: that is to say, it ceased to exist as a religion, and became asocial institution little better than the Church which has replaced it. Butinitiates -- men who had themselves seen God face to face, and lived --preserved the vital essence. They chose men; they tested them; theyinstructed them in methods of invoking the Visible Image of the Invisible.Thus by a living chain religion lived -- in the Mysteries of Eleusis. Further, recognising that the Great Work was henceforth to be secret, aworship of caverns and midnight groves and catacombs, no more of open fieldsand smiling bowers, they caused to be written in symbols by one of the lesserinitiates the whole Mystery of Godliness, so that after the renaissance thosewho were fitted to the work might infallibly discover the first matter of theWork and even many of the processes thereof."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Such writings are those of the neo-Platonists, and in modern times theGod-illumined Adept Berkeley, Christian though the called himself, is perhapsthe most distinguished {225B} of those who have understood this truth.<<EXTRACTS FROM BERKELEY'S EXTRACTS FROM THE BOOK OF THE LIFE  SACRED MAGIC OF ABRAMELIN   THE MAGE{1} \"There is a mystery about this visit I resolved to absent myselfto Dublin.

I am not denying that the vast storehouses of fact do help us to a certaindistillation (as it were) of their grain: but I may be allowed to complainwith Maudsley that there is nobody competent to do it. Even when a geniusdoes come along, his results will likely be as empirical as the facts theycover. Evolution is no better than creation to explain things, as Spencershowed. The truth of the matter appears to be that as reason is incompetent tosolve the problems of philosophy and religion, \"a fortiori\" science isincompetent. All that science can do is to present reason with new facts.To such good purpose has it done this, that no modern scientist can hope todo more than know a little about one bud on his pet twig of the particularbranch he has {228A} chosen to study, as it hangs temptingly from one boughof the Tree of Knowledge. One of the most brilliant of the younger school of chemists remarks in thecourse of a stirring discourse upon malt analysis: \"Of extremely complexorganic bodies the constitution of some 250,000 is known with certainty, andthe number grows daily. No one chemist pretends to an intimate acquaintancewith more than a few of these ...\" Why not leave it alone, and try to beGod? But even had we Maudsley's committee of geniuses, should we be in any realsense the better? Not while the reason is, as at present, the best guideknown to men, not until humanity has developed a mental power of an entirelydifferent kind. For to the philosopher it soon becomes apparent that reasonis a weapon inadequate to the task. Hume saw it, and became a sceptic in thewidest sense of the term. Mansel saw it, and counsels us to try Faith, as ifit was not the very fact that Faith was futile that bade us appeal to reason.Huxley saw it, and, no remedy presenting itself but a vague faith in thepossibilities of human evolution, called himself an agnostic: Kant saw it fora moment, but it soon hid itself behind his terminology; Spencer saw it, andtried to gloss it over by smooth talk, and to bury it beneath the ponderoustomes of his unwiedly erudition. I see it, too, and the way out to Life. But the labyrinth, if you please, before the clue: the Minotaur before themaiden! Thank you, madam; would you care to look at our new line in Minotaurs at2s. 3d.? This way, please."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" I have taken a good deal of trouble lately to prove the proposition \"Allarguments are arguments in a circle.\" Without wearying my readers with theformal proof, which I hope to advance one day in an essay on the syllogism, Iwill take (as sketchily as you please!) the obvious and important case of theconsciousness. A. The consciousness is made up exclusively {228B} of impressions (Thetendency to certain impressions is itself a result of impressions on theancestors of the conscious being). Locke, Hume, &c. B. Without a consciousness no impression can exist. Berkeley, Fichte, &c. Both A. and B. have been proved times without number, and quiteirrefutably. Yet they are mutually exclusive. The \"progress\" of philosophyhas consisted almost entirely of advances in accuracy of language by rivalschools who emphasised A. and B. alternately. It is easy to see that all propositions can, with a little ingenuity, bereduced to one form or the other.<<Compare the problems suggested to thelogician by the various readings of propositions in connotation, denotation,and comprehension respectively; and the whole question of existential import.-- A. C.>> Thus, if I say that grass is green, I mean that an external thing is aninternal thing: for the grass is certainly not in my eye, and the greencertainly \"is\" in it. As all will admit. So, if you throw a material brick at your wife, and hit her (as may happento all of us), there is a most serious difficulty in the question, \"At whatpoint did your (spiritual) affection for her transform into the (material)brick, and that again into her (spiritual) reformation?\" Similarly, we have Kant's clear proof that in studying the laws of naturewe only study the laws of our own minds: since, for one thing, the languagein which we announce a law is entirely the product of our mental conceptions. While, on the other hand, it is clear enough that our minds depend uponthe laws of nature, since, for one thing, the apprehension that six savageswill rob and murder you is immediately allayed by the passage of a leadenbullet weighting 230 grains, and moving at the rate of 1200 feet per second,through the bodies of two of the ringleaders. {229A} It would of course be simple to go on and show that after all we attach nomeaning to weight and motion, lead and bullet, but a purely spiritual one:that they are mere phases of our thought, as interpreted by our senses: andon the other that apprehension is only a name for a certain group of chemicalchanges in certain of the contents of our very material skulls: but enough!the whole controversy is verbal, and no more. Since therefore philosophy and \"a fortiori\" science are bankrupt, and theofficial receiver is highly unlikely to grant either a discharge; since theonly aid we get from the Bishops is a friendly counsel to drink Beer -- inplace of the spiritual wine of Omar Khayyam and Abdullah el Haji (on whom bepeace!) -- we are compelled to fend for ourselves. We have heard a good deal of late years about Oriental religions. I ammyself the chief of sinners.
