For some readers, it may at first seem strange to apply the word \"technology\" to the concept of esotericism. Technology is basically how-to knowledge, and esotericism (by whatever name) is True Sacred Living. We publish many practical books that teach the reader \"how to\" in many areas of the esoteric sciences. These are the techniques, the practical programming, the procedures to follow in working toward a particular accomplishment, the modus operandi. But the technician of the Sacred needs more than the knowledge of the method of operation. He or she also has to have basic infor-mation about the materials that will be utilized, or about the beings that will be invoked, or the tools to be used. And this infor-mation must be organized and presented from a sound, esoteric foundation. Sourcebooks may be presented in the form of dictionaries, encylopedias, anthologies, or new editions of classical works. Always, we produce these to actually meet the needs of the eso-teric practitioner and student. They bring to the reader what he or she needs to know in order to apply the how-to knowledge gained from text and guide books. A sourcebook is the distillation of factual knowledge from dozens of books and sources (sometimes veritable libraries) com-pounded with the practical experience of the author. No one can do an adequate job of gathering such factual knowledge unless they are themselves expert in the field represented. As publishers, we seek to provide the student with three out of the four vital elements essential to the sacred life: theoretical knowledge, practical knowledge, and factual knowledge. The fourth element can only come as the student brings these together, and gains experiential knowledge.

Perhaps it should be said at once that this book is not a comprehensive dictionary of the Hebrew lan-guage. Nor is it a complete dictionary of the \"kabbalah\" as under-stood by true cabalists, who are Jewish scholars and mystics of vast learning in the Talmud and the Torah. Rather, it is an encyclo-pedia of cabalism as understood and interpreted by the mystery schools and Hermetic societies of the West, in particular the Her-metic Order of the Golden Dawn as it existed in the waning years of the 19th century. This book is intended for those who wish a relatively complete encyclopedia, arranged alphabetically both in English and in Hebrew as well as numerically, of cabalism as thus understood. It is not necessary to have access to a large number of books on mys-ticism, magic, and the occult in order to trace down the basic meanings, Hebrew spellings, and enumerations of the hundreds of I originally chose \"cabala\" over several alternate spellings simply because it is favored by English-language dictionaries, and also to make it clear that the subject at hand is not being considered from a primarily Judaic standpoint. The Golden Dawn adepts seemed to prefer \"kabbalah,\" although it is more usual nowadays to see that spelling used to denote the traditional Jewish science. Most other writers now seem to prefer \"qabala,\" with the idea that it is \"closer to the Hebrew spelling.\" However, it is simply a matter of convention—not phonemics —that the letter representing the hard k sound of Hebrew is spelled qoph in English and transliterated with a q. It could just as well be, and often is, k or k—or c. xi"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xxxviii GODWIN'S CABALISTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA terms, words, and names included in this encyclopedia. This book contains a great many Hebrew words important for religious, philosophical, mystical, numerical, and other reasons. It contains the many names of God, the planets and astrological signs, and a large number of angels and demons, including those of the Shem ha-Mephorash and the Goetia. Also included are most of the cor-respondences of the 32 Paths of Wisdom; that is, the ten Sephiroth and the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. In this encyclopedia, little or no knowledge is assumed on the part of the student. The English magician Aleister Crowley pub-lished a numerological dictionary of the names and terms of cabal-ism in The Equinox, included here as an appendix. Crowley's dictionary, however, assumed that the reader had an extensive knowledge of cabalism already and would use the dictionary merely to discover numerological connections. It was arranged numerically only, not alphabetically, and no transliteration of the Hebrew was provided. In the present volume, however, very little is assumed. This introduction provides a basic outline of the Tree of Life and the Sephiroth, the Hebrew alphabet, the 32 Paths of Wis-dom, the four \"worlds\" of cabalism, etc. If there is any other term used in a definition which you do not understand, you need only look it up for a brief but informative clarification. For example, you may find Nachashiron defined as the Qlippoth of Sagittarius and wonder what Qlippoth means. Looking it up, you will find that the Qlippoth are shells or demons, so that the Nachashiron are the demonic order associated with Sagittarius. If you have only the vaguest idea—or no idea at all—as to what all the business is about Shem ha-Mephorash (not Anton LaVey's ignorant \"Shem Ham Phorash\"), you need only look up that term to find a full explanation. Why, you may well ask, should a Western, primarily Christian, mystery school or occult society such as the Golden Dawn or the Rosicrucians concern itself with the cabala, which is, after all, a form of Jewish mysticism? This point needs to be elucidated. Some of my friends used to be under the impression that I had compiled a dictionary of Judaism, which is certainly far from the truth. The Golden Dawn—and the Freemasons, for that matter—has been accused by anti-Semites of being a Zionist front organization because of its use of the cabala and the Hebrew language. This accusation is plainly absurd."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxiii First of all, it must be remembered that the basic religious text and holy book of Christianity is the Bible, and that the Old Testa-ment was originally written in Hebrew. Therefore, the use of Hebrew names and terms is inevitable in any Western organiza-tion that concerns itself with mysticism, even if it involves only a passing reference to \"Jehovah.\" \"Amen\" is a Hebrew word; so are \"hallelujah\" and \"sabaoth.\" No one accuses fundamentalist Chris-tians of being covert Zionists because they believe in the story of Creation, originally written in Hebrew, as given in the first of the five books of Moses. Second, the Western occult societies were, and are, much con-cerned with ceremonial magic for the purpose of integrating the personality and achieving union with God (or cosmic conscious-ness, if you prefer—or attaining to the knowledge and conversa-tion of your holy guardian angel). Any study or pursuit of ceremonial magic inevitably involves the cabala. Why? The study of cabala came to be considered important philosophically and theologically due to the efforts of Renaissance Neoplatonists such as Pico della Mirandola and Johann Reuchlin, who were influ-enced by Jewish sages who had been exiled from Spain in 1492. (At this point, the cabala was wrenched from its roots to the extent of using it to \"prove\" Christianity.) These men in turn heavily influ-enced Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, who virtually defined ceremo-nial magic for centuries to come in his Three Books of Occult Philosophy. Both directly and indirectly (through The Magus of Francis Barrett, published in 1801), Agrippa's work formed one of the major sources for the methods of the Golden Dawn. Third, cabalism includes the only really complete and compre-hensive method I know of classifying the universe, both macrocosm and microcosm, the various levels of existence, and the extensive hierarchies of angels and demons. I suppose that the literature of Sufism may contain something similar, and that this encyclopedia could just as well have been in Arabic. However, the full extent of that literature is not available in English, and those interested in the subject are far more familiar with the Hebrew system. It is notable that efforts to construct similar systems in different contexts usually have to fall back on the Hebrew model, so that the Norse World Tree Yggdrasil, for example, is forced to assume the unfamiliar—and per-haps less than congenial—guise of the Tree of the Sephiroth."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xxxviii GODWIN'S CABALISTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA At this point, it should be stated that I have no connection with or membership in any mystery school or occult society of any kind that has imparted to me under oath any of the information included in this encyclopedia. Everything here is widely available in published material and is not part of any teaching that has ever been passed to me. All I have done is to make a collection of these names and terms, determine their numerical values by adding the values of the letters, arrange them alphabetically and by numerical value, make a few corrections that I felt to be necessary in some of the spellings and transliterations, and put the result together in this encyclopedia. The Tree of Life CABALISM, at least in the Western occult tradition, is built around a diagram called the Tree of Life (see figure on facing page). This diagram contains ten circles representing the Sephiroth (singu-lar: Sephirah); that is, the \"spheres,\" \"numbers,\" or \"emanations.\" The Sephiroth are the numbers 1 through 10 considered in their archetypal sense. Each Sephirah is an archetypal idea. Also, the Sephiroth represent emanations from God and describe the pro-cess of creation. In the material world, they represent the heavenly spheres according to the classical conception. Beyond the first Sephirah, Kether (\"Crown\"), are the \"three veils of negative existence\": Nothing, Infinity, and the Limitless Light (or Ain, Ain-Soph, and Ain-Soph Aur). These describe the process of manifestation from nothingness prior to the existence of unity (represented by Kether). They are without number, although Crowley designated them as 0, 00, and 000. The user of this encyclopedia will constantly encounter refer-ences to these Sephiroth, so it is well to keep them in mind. The fol-lowing table gives their numbers, Hebrew names, English names, and correspondences in the physical universe. Sephirah English Celestial Spheres 1. Kether Crown Primum Mobile 2.

As such, they are referred to the lowest, grossest, and most material of the four \"worlds\" of cabalism, namely, the World of Action (Olam ha-Assiah). The Tree of Life also exists in three higher stages or planes. The highest and least material of these is the World of Nobility (Olam Atziluth), Plato's world of archetypes. In Atziluth, each Sephirah is associated with a name of God peculiar to its nature. For example, Geburah is associated with the name Elohim Gibor, \"God Almighty,\" God in His role as a stern judge and dispenser of justice untempered by mercy. In Roman mythology, the corre-sponding god-name is, of course, Mars. Next comes the World of Creation, Olam ha-Briah, wherein the Sephiroth are associated with various archangels. Here one en-counters the familiar names of Raphael, Michael, and Gabriel. Below Briah is the World of Formation, Olam ha-Yetzirah; here, the Sephirah are associated with various angelic choirs or orders of angels, such as the Cherubim and Seraphim. Finally comes Assiah, the physical world. The ten Sephiroth are connected by 22 lines or \"paths,\" also sometimes called \"channels\" (the Hebrew word is netivoth). These 22 paths correspond to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Each path is associated with an element, a planet, or an astrological sign. The three \"mother letters\" of Hebrew, Aleph, Mem, and Shin, are associated with the three original elements: Air, Water, and Fire, respectively. The seven \"double letters\" are associated with the seven traditional planets, and the twelve \"single letters\" with the signs of the Zodiac."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxiii In addition to the correspondences and associations described above, the Sephiroth and the 22 paths, collectively referred to as the 32 Paths of Wisdom, are associated with any number of other sys-tems and conceptions. For example, the seven heavens, seven hells, and seven earths are associated with the Sephiroth in a very orderly manner, as are the Dukes and Kings of Edom listed in Genesis. The 42-letter name of God is broken into groups of letters and assigned to the Sephiroth. Each path is associated with a particular \"intelli-gence\" (e.g., \"The Fourteenth path is called the Illuminating Intelli-gence ...\")/ or mode of consciousness, and these are often used to rationalize the specific assignment of the trumps of the Tarot cards to the 22 letters (although I confess that the Intelligences have always been unintelligble to me). The small cards of the Tarot are associated with the decanates of the Zodiac, which are in turn asso-ciated with the 12 single letters. (A decanate is a span of ten degrees. Each sign of the Zodiac therefore contains three decanates. A quinance is a span of five degrees, or half a decanate. Thus, the entire Zodiac of 360 degrees contains 36 decanates or 72 quinances.) In fact, nothing whatever exists that cannot somehow be attributed to the component parts of the Tree of Life. In some cases, such attri-butions may seem arbitrary or forced. In most instances, however, they work out surprisingly well. Also central to cabalism is Tetragrammaton, the four-letter name of God, YHVH (Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh), Yahweh, sometimes rendered as \"Jehovah\" and usually translated as \"the Lord.\" The four conso-nants of the Name correspond to the four elements (Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, respectively) and to the four \"worlds\" described above. The four consonants are often described as a family: Yod is the Father, the masculine aspect of God, or Yang in Chinese thought; it is associated with the Sephirah Chokmah, which is also called Abba, \"the Supernal Father.\" (The Supernal Sephiroth, by the way, are Kether, Chokmah, and Binah—the first triad. These are said to be sep-arated from the other Sephiroth by the Abyss.) The first heh is the Mother, the feminine aspect of God, Yin, Aima or \"the Supernal Mother,\" associated with Binah. Binah is thus the archetype of the Great Mother. Vav is the Son and includes the Sephiroth 4 through 9, although it is particularly associated with Tiphareth. Tiphareth is therefore associated with Christ. The final heh is the Daughter, asso-ciated with Malkuth and variously called Malkah, \"the Queen,\" or"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"xxxviii GODWIN'S CABALISTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA Kalah, \"the Bride.\" This Daughter is the beautiful Maya of Hinduism and represents material existence. She is redeemed by the mystical marriage to the Son, Tiphareth. In Judaism, she is the community of Israel and, in Christianity, the Church. This basic explanation of the Tree of Life has been necessarily brief and superficial. A fuller understanding of the concepts involved may be obtained by a study of some of the texts listed in the bibliography at the end of this encyclopedia. The Hebrew Alphabet IN PREVIOUS EDITIONS of the Encyclopedia, no attempt was made to reproduce the characters of the Hebrew alphabet. I avoided their use because of the difficulties involved in typesetting, and because misprints are easy to make and difficult to spot in proof-reading due to the similarities of some of the characters. I fol-lowed the example of S. L. MacGregor Mathers in The Kabbalah Unveiled by using English letters to indicate Hebrew letters. In the present edition, however, technology has rendered such a makeshift approach unnecessary and awkward. Hebrew letters are used throughout whenever a word is spelled in Hebrew, although English transliterations are also given. That is, the Hebrew word for peace is given as both shalom and but no longer as ShLWM. Anyone familiar with Hebrew will immediately see that I have omitted all diacritical marks. There are two reasons for this. With regard to the Hebrew scriptures, the Masoretic points were not invented until long after the text was written down. In many cases, their placement represents an educated guess combined with ancient tradition. It seems somehow more authentic to leave them out—not to mention the fact that their omission is less likely to confuse and intimidate the reader who is not familiar with the lan-guage. Second, virtually all of the cabalistic literature of the West-ern Hermetic Tradition likewise omits these vowel points. In a great many cases, their insertion in the terms and names of this encyclopedia would represent a presumptive guess on my part and would be misleading and inaccurate. A word, then, about transliteration. The Hebrew alphabet has no vowels apart from the Masoretic points. In the case of names and terms that do not exist in modern Hebrew, a transliteration"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxiii was usually provided in my source(s). Where it was not, I endeav-ored to insert such vowels as seemed likely. In transliterating Hebrew, conventions have changed over the past hundred years, and even now there is no universally accepted standard. Consequently, there are many spelling variations, as with the word \"cabala\" itself. Few of these variations can be said to be altogether wrong, so it comes down to a matter of preference. I have followed what seems to be the prevailing modern style of transliteration except in cases where usage differs considerably from the Western Hermetic Tradition and the Golden Dawn. In that case, I have followed the older tradition, even though it may at times appear quaint, if not downright incorrect. Thus fl^ is now almost universally rendered eretz, but virtually all of the mag-ical and occult literature now current spells it aretz. Everyone who has dipped into the literature knows that \"light\" is aur, but the proper transliteration according to modern standards (and a less ambiguous representation of the proper pronunciation) is 'or. The well-known scholar of Jewish mysticism, Gershom Scholem, transliterated as kelipot, whereas it appears everywhere else as qlippoth. Modern usage favors transliterating (and pro-nouncing) the feminine plural as -ot, whereas the older and more familiar style is -oth. Although technically more nearly correct, at least as far as modern Hebrew pronunciation is concerned, I have nevertheless avoided such renderings as sabaot and Ashtarot. The Hebrew letter 1, vav, was probably called waw and pro-nounced as \"w\" in Biblical times, but that is only a probability and a matter of academic opinion. Older editions of this encyclopedia used the \"w.\" For esthetic reasons if nothing else, I have now fol-lowed the modern pronunciation/transliteration in this case (which also happens to correspond to the practice within the Golden Dawn). Unfortunately, this may cause some confusion in that one form of the letter Beth (3), without the daghesh p), is also v- (The older style was always to render beth as \"b,\" regardless of whether it contained the daghesh or not.) However, the accompa-nying Hebrew spelling should always clarify which of the two consonants is meant, 1 or 2.

Arabic numbers are (or were) not used in Hebrew; instead, numbers were indicated by the consonants. Hence, each letter has a numerical value. This leads very naturally into the concept of gematria, wherein every word or name has a numerical value. Words, names, and phrases with the same numerical value are assumed to be somehow related (but not necessarily as identities or even syn-onyms). This concept is basic to cabalism. Some letters have two numerical values. The second, larger value is sometimes used when the letter falls at the end of the word. The letter then takes on a different shape and is, in fact, a different character. These characters are called the \"finals.\" Evi-dence seems to suggest that counting these characters at their greater values was a late innovation and was unknown to the orig-inal writers of scripture—whereas internal evidence abounds that they were familiar with gematria itself. Hebrew Pronunciation IN USING THIS GENERAL GUIDE for the pronunciation of Hebrew, the following points should be borne in mind. 1. Scarcely any rule can be set forth that does not have some exception. 2. There are variations in pronunciation among Sephardic, Ashkenazic, Israeli, medieval, and ancient Hebrew—not to men-tion such related tongues as Aramaic, Ladino, and Yiddish. Thus the ai in Adonai may be pronounced like the oi in oil, the i in light, or as ah-ee. The latter is probably closest to the original, but mod-ern practice is to pronounce the final syllable as \"eye.\" 3. Traditional transliterations, which I have used in this ency-clopedia when their usage has been so widespread as to be unavoidable, are not standardized and are not always so literal or indicative of pronunciation as modern practices would dictate. For example, Michael should properly be transliterated as Mikha'el (to distinguish kaph from cheth) and pronounced mee-chah-ale, with a glottal stop between the last two syllables (which may be ignored for all practical purposes) and the kaph pronounced like the soft German ch in ich. The present spelling derives from the Greek, wherein the kaph was transliterated as chi."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"xxxviii GODWIN'S CABALISTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA 4. Inasmuch as vowel points were not perfected until the sev-enth century AD, there is some doubt as to whether the traditional pronunciations are equivalent to those of the ancient Hebrew. 5. The Anglicized spellings and pronunciations of the King James Bible often bear only a minimal relationship to the original; for exam-ple, Isaac and Itzchaq, Jeremiah and Yirmyah, Joshua and Yehoshuah. 6. In my own transliterations, I have not made use of apostro-phes or inverted commas to designate the presence of aleph and ayin as is done in strict transliteration. These consonants may be regarded as silent; hence there seems little need to indicate them in a work of this nature in which the Hebrew spellings are also given. In general, Hebrew words are either accented on the last sylla-ble, with secondary accents falling on every other syllable before the ultimate, or on the penultimate syllable. Thus we have a-do-NAI, but AH-retz (not a-RETZ), Me-TAT-ron, san-DAL-phon, etc. Here, then, are the pronunciations of transliterated Hebrew, insofar as any rules can be given: Transliterated Usually Trans-Letter literation of Pronunciation a vowel point a as in father or a as in cat b beth (3) b c kaph p) k ch cheth; kaph* ch as in German nacht; ch in German ich d daleth fT) d dh daleth (1) th in the (hard th) e vowel point e as in met or e as in grey; as a schwa, a as in sofa, abut f peh (3) f g gimel (3) g as in gamble (never like j) gh gimel (3) Semitic gh h he; cheth** h; ch as in German nacht *I have generally tried to avoid ch as a transliteration of kaph, although there are some cases (such as Michael) where it has proved unavoidable. **I have avoided transliterating cheth as h."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxiii Transliterated Usually Trans-Letter literation of Pronunciation i vowel point; i as in fin or i as in gasoline; yod as a consonant, y j yod y k kaph p) k kh kaph p) ch as in German ich 1 lamed 1 m mem m n nun n o vowel point; o as in not or o as in obey vav (as vav, always the latter) P peh (2) P ph peh (3) f q qoph k r resh r s samekh; shin s sh shin sh t teth; tau t th tau th as in thin (soft th) ts or tz tzaddi ts as in tsar, cats u vowel point; u as in cut or u as in glue; vav (as vav, always the latter) V beth p); vav v (or, in the case of vav, may be w) w vav w X — not used; letter derived from samekh y yod y z zayin z This table is not altogether complete, as I have not included all possible peculiarities of pronunciation.

In Ashkenazic, followed by Regardie in some of his writings, tau becomes s.

These distinctions, which exist only in Semitic languages such as Hebrew and Arabic, are rarely noticeable and may be safely ignored by Western speakers. As for the pronunciation of the names of the Goetic spirits, it should be remembered that these names in their present form are from a French manuscript. Their Hebrew forms, assuming they ever had any, have in most cases been altered beyond recognition, although they aren't quite French, either. Personally, I prefer to pronounce them as if they were Latin—except for the accented vowels, which I give the French pronunciation. For magical purposes generally, I think that you should bear in mind the general rules of Hebrew pronunciation but use the pro-nunciation that seems most natural to the tongue or that seems to carry the most power or psychic weight. It could just as well be argued, however—and has been—that only the true names truly pronounced have any real power. In any case, it is probably safe to assume that many names and words of power no longer have quite the force they once did when they were spoken only in secret by the few. It is said that the power of a word is dissipated by overuse, and this is certainly true subjectively, and not only of deity names and magic words. There are words that, when I was a child, were capable of shaking the foundations of the universe and bringing down parental lightning bolts, but which are now spoken hundreds of times—to no appreciable effect—in every motion pic-ture from Hollywood and which are heard spewing from the lips of every babe. They no longer have any power. How to Use This Encyclopedia THIS ENCYCLOPEDIA is divided into four sections. The first and most comprehensive is the \"Transliterated Hebrew\" section. In this section, the words and names are given in their transliterated form, with vowels, arranged alphabetically according to the English alphabet. Section I contains the most nearly complete defi-nitions and the various subsidiary data and correspondences of the more important concepts. For example, each entry for a sign of the Zodiac gives the hierarchy of angels and demons associated with that sign, the color, the scent (from Crowley's 777), the Tarot trump"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxiii and Tarot cards of the decanates, the direction, the tribe of Israel, the apostle of Christ, the geomantic figure, the mystic number of the associated path, the ruling planet, the planet exalted in that sign, the planet in detriment, and the planet in fall. The entries for the demons of the Goetia include complete descriptions: the rank of the demon and the number of legions of infernal spirits he com-mands, the form in which he appears, and his powers or offices. English words are now included in Section I, but are set in all capital letters to distinguish them from the Hebrew terms. Section I thereby incorporates Sections I and II of previous editions. In these older editions, if you wanted to find information about the sign Aries, for example, you had to consult Section II to find the Hebrew word meaning Aries (namely Taleh) and then look up Taleh in Section I to find the information you needed. Taleh is still included in this edition in its normal alphabetical order, but all the information about Aries is to be found under the entry ARIES in the same section. The present Section II, \"Hebrew,\" is arranged alphabetically according to the Hebrew spellings and order of the Hebrew alpha-bet. It is essentially the same as Section I, except that the definitions are not as extensive. This section is intended to be used when the Hebrew spelling is known but not the transliterated form. It is quite common in the literature to come upon a word or name that is given only in the form of Hebrew consonants and is accompa-nied by minimal explanation. Such words or names may easily be sought in Section II. This section is also useful in discovering some of the etymological relationships between words. Finally, Section III, \"Numerical Values,\" is arranged according to the numerical values (gematria) of the words and names. Here, one may see at once all the numerical identities. In this section, words counted at their greater values due to final letters are marked with an asterisk. Thus H = 54, but *H (where the final Nun is counted as 700) = 704. Gematria TA7efeter s New International Dictionary (1927 Edition—much more useful than any modern edition) defines gematria as follows: A cryptograph in the form of a word the letters of which have the numerical values of the word taken as the hidden meaning; also,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"xxxviii GODWIN'S CABALISTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA the cabalistic method of explaining the Hebrew Scriptures by means of the cryptographic significance of the words. Thus, the first word of Genesis in Hebrew, meaning \"in the beginning,\" has the numerical value 913, which is the same as that of the Hebrew phrase meaning \"in the law it was made.\" Hence, the cabalists declare the law to have existed from the beginning, and that the creation was effected by it. Gematria, as in the above example, was used by medieval cabal-ists primarily for Biblical exegesis and as a means of encoding secret lore, but it has a much wider application than that, particularly now that it seems to have entered, along with the cabala as a whole, the collective unconscious (or, if you prefer, the akashic record). All the entries under any one particular number in Section III are, according to the doctrine, somehow related. In many cases, the connection is far from obvious. These cases may form the subjects of intellectual \"meditations,\" wherein one tries to see just how two apparently unrelated words may be related. Such meditations are useful in a number of ways. An orthodox cabalist would say they help one to understand the nature of the Universe and of God. In any event, it does sharpen the mind and helps one to see the innate unity of all things. In looking through this section, one is continually amazed at the number of entries that relate the sublimest concepts to the low-est. For example, the numerical value is the same (1190) for both the Seraphim, the angelic choir, and Seirim, meaning hairy ones or demons. Tath Zal, the Profuse Giver, a \"title\" (name) of Kether, has the same numerical value as Paimon, the demon king of Fire. The title of Crowley's Liber 777 was inspired by the fact that 777 is the value of both achath ruach Elohim chayyim (One is the Spirit of the Living God) and Olam ha-Qlippoth (the World of Shells or Demons). The solution to such problems, if they are problems, may lie in the cabalistic doctrine, \"As above, so below.\" This statement is merely the cabalistic way of stating the doctrine of the macrocosm and the microcosm, but it is also true that all the divine and angelic hierar-chies have their equivalents in hell. Those who argue for the validity of gematria seldom advance such embarrassing examples. Far more popular are such numeri-cal identities as \"love\" (Ahbah) and \"unity\" (Achad), which both equal 13. In any event, the correspondences are always interesting-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxiii It should be pointed out that numerology of this kind works equally well with any alphabet and any language. If one assigns numbers to the letters of the English alphabet, from 1 to 26 consec-utively, one may arrive with a little experimentation at any num-ber of astounding numerical correspondences. For example, \"Jesus\" and \"Messiah\" both add to 74. (\"Jesus\" is 10 plus 5 plus 19 plus 21 plus 19, or 74; \"Messiah\" is 13 plus 5 plus 19 plus 19 plus 9 plus 1 plus 8, or 74.) (Incidentally, the English word \"God\" in this system adds to 26, the same as YHVH in Hebrew.) One may therefore argue that gematria, and in fact all numerology, is the purest nonsense. On the other hand, one may take such phenomena as proof that it does have validity. In any case, it is doubtless a mistake to take it too seriously or carry it too far. Doing so can result in the grossest delusions. Nevertheless, numerology does form an interesting exercise that enhances the thinking process, or at least one aspect of the thinking process (the ability to see relationships, vital to the artist or scientist), and that inevitably leads to the conclusion, fundamental to mysticism, that all things are related and are, in fact, one. The final realization of the student of gematria is that, as stated in The Book of the Law (the Word as revealed to Crowley, not to be confused with the Torah), \"Every number is infinite; there is no difference.\" Gematria is not to be confused with popular numerology wherein any number is reduced to a single digit by adding the digits of that number. In gematria—and in all valid numerology—every number has its own meaning. Reducing everything in creation to nine digits is a gross and misleading oversimplification, only three-quarters as good as the popular newspaper horoscopes, which lump the entire population of the world into 12 categories. If one believes such \"horoscopes,\" then it follows that approximately 444 million people should, on any given day, \"receive unexpected news,\" \"make new business contacts,\" or whatever. Astrology is an individual affair; no two people have the same horoscope. In numerology, no two numbers—of however many digits—have the same meaning. Another cautionary note must be added: it is a mistake to think °f the Tree of Life, the Sephiroth, the Paths, the planetary spheres, and so on as having some sort of physical or objective existence. these things are only ordered concepts to aid one in thinking about abstract matters, primarily divine or supernatural matters."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"xxxviii GODWIN'S CABALISTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA We know now, of course, that the classical conception of the uni-verse embodied in the cabala has no relation to physical reality. The earth is not the center of nine heavenly spheres inhabited by choirs of angels; there are more than seven planets, and the Sun and Moon are not planets at all, properly speaking; all matter is not made up of only four elements. It is important to realize that these things, in cabalism as now understood, are concepts, labels for classification, archetypal ideas, etc., and not physical realities. As for the innumerable angels, demons, spirits, and so on to be encountered in cabalism and magic, it is simply a matter of opin-ion and belief as to whether they have any objective reality. At one time, Crowley thought they represented unconscious forces in the psyche. This view seems as good as any. In one case, someone evokes a spirit in order to control it. In another case, one tries to come to an understanding of some aspect of one's own uncon-scious mind that is affecting behavior for the worse or that could affect it for the better. The first instance is magic, condemned as nonsense and delusion. The second is psychology, usually recog-nized as valid. But the difference is mainly one of terminology. Correspondences THE SYSTEM OF CORRESPONDENCES followed in this encyclopedia is that taught by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with some additions by Aleister Crowley, a onetime member of that order. The bulk of this system is to be found in The Golden Dawn by Israel Regardie (Llewellyn Publications) and in Liber 777 by Aleis-ter Crowley (Samuel Weiser, Inc.), although these two books were very far from my only sources in compiling this encyclopedia. Unfortunately, both these texts contain a number of misprints, especially in the names rendered in Hebrew letters. It has been possible to verify the Hebrew spellings of the 72 angels of the Shem ha-Mephorash from other sources, ultimately from the Hebrew text of Exodus. However, these two books are the only sources I know for the Hebrew spellings of the 36 angels of the decanates and of various other angels, and they do not always agree. In cases of conflict, I have arbitrarily chosen Crowley's spelling and made a note in the definition of Regardie's. The only reason for this choice is that Crowley had access to earlier docu-ments of the Order which are less likely to have been altered by"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxiii repeated copying. In cases where only one source is available, I have corrected what I took to be obvious misprints. I have found it necessary to supply my own English transliter-ations of the names of many of these Zodiacal angels, inasmuch as English versions are given neither by Crowley nor Regardie. I have also taken the liberty of improving the transliterations of Mathers and of Francis Barrett in many cases. In a few instances, such as with the names of the Olympic Planetary Spirits, I have supplied my own version of likely Hebrew spellings where none are other-wise available. The Hebrew spellings of the Goetic demons are Crowley's (but see below). The names of the angels of the 12 astro-logical houses are to be found in various sources as the angels of the 12 signs of the Zodiac, and the English spellings of these names indicate in some instances that the Hebrew spellings given both by Crowley and Regardie contain misprints. In these cases, I have ignored the older English version and taken the Hebrew spelling of Crowley and Regardie as a correct \"restoration.\" Meanwhile, be advised that the Golden Dawn/Crowley sys-tem is far from being the one and only such system revealed from on high by the Secret Chiefs. For example, all versions of the ancient cabalistic text, the Sepher Yetzirah, have radically different assignments of the Hebrew double letters to the planets from those used in the Golden Dawn. In the assignment of the Tarot Trumps to the letters, the system of the French mystic/magician Eliphas Levi differs in every point from that of the Golden Dawn. Of course, he \"knew better\" and published his attributions as a 'blind\" (although it seems to me that it would have been far sim-pler merely to remain silent). Nevertheless, there remains to this day a large school of followers who prefer to believe that he was telling the truth. Even the configuration of the Tree of Life and the assignments of the letters to the paths have other versions, at least one of them rather more elegant than that used by the Golden Dawn—and by almost everyone else since. One small variation noted in the entries of this encyclopedia is m astrological attributions and Hebrew spellings of the names of the spirits of the Goetia. The mystical/magical order Aurum lis has an alternate system that is of sufficient importance to be taken into account. As concerns the angels of the Shem ha-Mephorash, however, the Aurum Solis uses the same attributions"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"xxxviii GODWIN'S CABALISTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA as the Golden Dawn and Crowley, attributing the first such angel to the first quinance of Leo rather than Aries. According to MacGregor Mathers, who wrote the bulk of the materials used by the Golden Dawn, the Zodiac should start at 0° Leo rather than 0° Aries, and he defined the star Regulus as being exactly at 0° Leo. Consequently, at least as far as the Golden Dawn is concerned, the astrological attributions of both the demons of the Goetia and the angels of the Shem ha-Mephorash start at 0° Leo. Practical Uses HAVING COME SO FAR, you may be asking, \"But of what possible use is all this?\" Perhaps you are inclined to echo the British periodical Prediction, when its reviewer commented, \"if this is what 'psychological and spiritual growth' is all about, then God help us!\" Superficially, any cabalistic compendium of this kind would appear to be an abstruse work, of interest only to scholars or, at best, ceremonial magicians. Not so. The two traditional pragmatic uses of the cabala, as opposed to theory and speculation alone, are meditation and magic. Meditation Meditation, in one form or another, formed the earliest application of cabala aside from its somewhat more theoretical use as a tool for interpreting holy writ. The simplest form of cabalistic meditation is to use one of the many names of God as a mantra. This practice can be adopted to magical purposes by repeatedly intoning a divine name that is germane to the desired effect. You can be even more specific by using one of the names of the angels of the Shem ha-Mephorash along with the accompanying verse from Psalms (which is now included in this encyclopedia under the entry for each angel). Naturally, the only legitimate aim of magic for the spiritually advanced individual is divine union, the Great Work, the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, or whatever you may wish to call it. Anything else may be excusable for those not so advanced, but, in the minds of purists, it repre-sents a misuse and perversion of divine things. Whatever the purpose of a meditation, even if it is only medi-tation for its own sake, it is better and safer if the psycho-spiritual"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxiii climate is purified in some way beforehand. This can be accom-plished by some people within the meditation itself, by taking the time to calm the mind and body and mentally banish all negative and disturbing influences. Others, particularly aspiring magicians, may prefer a ritual approach that accomplishes the above objec-tives while also providing practice in minor ceremonial procedure. Quite aside from their utilitarian value, such exercises have value in themselves. For example, you might begin the practice with the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram (see Regardie's Golden Dawn) or Star Ruby ritual (Crowley, Magick in Theory and Practice and else-where). Then sit down in a comfortable position or in a practiced asana (meditational position) and free the mind from all other thoughts but the matter at hand. Incidentally, do not worry about any \"hidden traps\" in the Crowley ritual. The widdershins circumambulation is entirely in harmony with a banishing ritual. A cabalistic tradition of almost equal antiquity with that of mantra, and one requiring mental/magical protections to a much greater extent than ordinary meditation, is astral travel through the paths and spheres of the Tree of Life, retracing the way to God—that which is now called \"pathworking.\" In the original form, or in the oldest form of which we have record, the travel was evidently accomplished in a fiery chariot, in emulation of Elijah. At present, pathworking consists primarily of imaginative jour-neys along the paths of the Tree, from Sephirah to Sephirah. One begins in Malkuth and ascends the 32nd Path to Yesod. In this way one travels all the paths of the Tree in a series of meditations. It is important to know the correspondences of any given path so that you will know whether you are on the right track. The astral world is much larger than our own, and the byways, blind alleys, and self-deceits are innumerable. For that reason, the initial practice of pathworking is best carried out in a series of guided meditations, perhaps in a small group. It is well known that the primary requisites for success in a magician are will and imagination. These faculties may be devel-oped through what might be termed \"gematriatic contemplation,\" a technique hinted at previously. The mere act of adding and com-paring words and phrases develops the intellectual faculty (left-brain functions), while consideration of the significance of correspondences develops the intuition (right-brain functions)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"xxxviii GODWIN'S CABALISTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA Elijah in his chariot of fire from an engraving by Gustave Dore, from The Holy Bible, with Illustrations by Gustave Dore, 1866 A useful practice is the contemplation of numeric correspon-dences. Not only does this constitute a good mental exercise, but it expands your understanding of magic and the magical uni-verse. After establishing protections, centering, and quieting the mind, consider—not too intellectually—the chosen correspon-dence and, by leaving the mind open to impressions, try to under-stand the relationship involved. It might be well to begin with fairly straightforward correspondences, such as gadhol (\"great\"), yedidiah (\"beloved of God,\" used in reference to Solomon), and mag (\"magus\"), all 43, and work up to more abstruse matters such as correspondences that seem contradictory and disharmonious, such as tohu (\"desolation, without form\") and Hekel Ratzon (\"Palace of Delight,\" one of the seven heavens), both 411.

Following such a contem-lative exercise, close with the same ritual as was used to begin. It will be noted that such an exercise, aside from developing both halves of the brain, provides practice in ceremonial procedure and in concentration and visualization (dharana). Skeptics may object that, if you engage in such a practice, you are fooling yourself, inasmuch as you may be trying to see rela-tionships where none exist aside from an artificial and entirely coincidental numerical correspondence. But the ability to see relationships where none seem to exist is the basis of all creative thought. Even if gematria were indeed delusion and nonsense (and it can be if it is taken too seriously and used carelessly, arbi-trarily, and liberally; or if it becomes obsessional), the aim of the exercise remains the same—mental development, an expansion of consciousness, perhaps an indirect perception of the unity of all things. Magic THE GOLEM OF PRAGUE is perhaps the most famous example of \"practical cabala\"—the use of cabala for magical ends. To pro-tect the Jews in the ghetto during a period of persecution, Rabbi Loew created an artificial man made of clay or mud. To animate the creature, he wrote the word \"Truth\" on the golem's forehead; in Hebrew, Emeth, rm (presumably without Masoretic points). After the golem had gotten out of control, Rabbi Loew destroyed the creature by erasing the letter aleph (a) from its forehead, leav-ing the word Meth, no, \"dead.\" The story of the golem is (probably) only a legend, but practi-cal cabala in the form of amulets and talismans has been practiced as long as anyone can determine and is still being practiced today. Talismans—Traditionally, dating back at least to medieval Europe, the chief magical use of the cabala—which is sometimes termed the \"practical cabala\"—is the making and consecration of talismans. This encyclopedia is invaluable in the construction of talismans or any purpose. It is only necessary to relate the purpose of the alisman to one of the Sephiroth, usually and most easily through me associated planet.

Looking up the appropriate planet or Sephirah in this encyclopedia, you are presented with a wealth of material that may be used on the talisman. It should in any case include the appropriate God name, the name of the archangel, the name of the choir of angels, and the name of the planetary sphere. It would also be helpful to include the name of the spirit and the intelli-gence of that sphere. All of these should be engraved in well-made Hebrew characters, ideally on the appropriate metal (copper for Venus, gold for the Sun, tin for Jupiter, and so on). It would also be extremely helpful to include on the talisman the name (in Hebrew) of the individual involved, whether yourself or another, if at all possible in a form that enumerates to an appropriate number—but in any case not to a disharmonious number.

Testing—Even apart from talismans, gematria is integral to the use of the cabala in ceremonial magic, whether for theurgic (God-seeking) or thaumaturgic (pragmatic) ends. Once you have passed beyond the stage of the novice and are engaged in such practices as traveling or scrying in the spirit vision, astral travel, or active imagination (different names for real or imaginary out-of-the-body experiences), gematria is invaluable. The method once taught in the Golden Dawn has the advantage (if not the necessity) of involving controls and protections and also encourages the under-standing and verification of the experiences undergone in that state. It is here that gematria comes into its own. Gematria is the one effective method used to test the validity of the experience and the authenticity of the beings encountered, as well as to understand the natures of these beings. An excellent example of this is given in a letter by Aleister Crowley (Magick With-out Tears, Llewellyn, 1973). While traveling astrally, a formidable giant is encountered. The traveler determines his environment to be of a Saturnian nature and assumes an appropriate god-form. The Chimaera, recognizing your divine authority, becomes less formidable and menacing in appearance. He may, in some way, indicate his willingness to serve you. Very good, so far; but it is of course, the first essen-tial to make sure of his integrity. Accordingly you begin"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxiii by asking his name.

It adds up to 135.1 daresay you don't remember what the Sepher Sephi-roth tells you about that number; but as luck will have it, there is no need to inquire; for 135 = 3 x 45. Three is the first number of Saturn and 45 is the last. That corresponds beautifully with everything you have got so far ... Concerning Crowley, any perusal of his writings makes it clear that he relied heavily on gematria during his astral scrying as well as in many other matters. In fact, his acceptance of The Book of the Law (dictated to him in Cairo in 1904 by an entity known as Aiwass) was primarily based on the large number of gematriatic correspondences; for example, Heru-Ra-Ha, Boleskine (his retreat in Scotland), Abrahadabra, Cheth (spelled out), To Me (Greek, \"the not\"), Parzival, and Pallas Athene all add up to 418. Evocation (and Invocation)—A related use of gematria in cere-monial magic is to test the integrity of beings who manifest them-selves during evocation, both as to their names and natures and as to the validity of their replies. This testing applies as well to the beings summoned in the rites of Wicca as to the entities evoked in high ceremony. According to the basic tenets of magic, knowing the correct name of an entity gives you power over it. Gematria is essential for establishing the authenticity of such names and is practically indispensable for the effectiveness of the ceremony and ceremonial objects used to evoke them in the first place! Any talis-man, seal, or \"pentacle\" used in the ceremony (or rite) should be appropriately inscribed with names and words that are not cabalis-tically disharmonious. It would be detrimental if not dangerous for a magician named, for example, Milton Harris, to inscribe his ini-tials, Mem Heh (45), on a device meant to control a spirit associated with Chesed and Jupiter. (This also applies to names and words written in English.) As an example, suppose we ask some such being, as a test, to give us a number associated with King David of the Bible. If he says \"fourteen,\" we will be disappointed; that is simply the enu-meration of David in Hebrew. But suppose he gives us \"twenty-eight.\" That is twice 14, which is some indication, but it is also yadid, meaning \"one beloved.\" Inasmuch as the name David"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"xxxviii GODWIN'S CABALISTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA means \"beloved,\" the number serves to verify that the being is giv-ing correct information. (Twenty-eight is also koch, \"strength\" and yichudh, \"union with God,\" both of which could be said to pertain to King David. It is also the number of the seventh path of the Tree of Life—that is, of Netzach—and is further identified with love through the association of that Sephirah with Venus.) If, on the other hand, the being were to give us \"thirty-five\" in answer to our question, we might well be at a loss to make any connection with David. If no such connection can be found even after diligent investigation, the being can be assumed to be deceit-ful or evasive and obedience must be enforced. Although these definitions are not always adhered to strictly, it is generally true that evocation means to summon an entity to visi-ble appearance, as an objective being, whereas invocation means to bring an entity within oneself, to allow that entity to possess/suf-fuse one's being. In classical times, \"invocation\" seems to have involved calling an entity into a statue for purposes of obtaining information, but, by any sort of rigorous definition, that is really evocation. At any rate, the usual emphasis in evocation is on demons and spirits, whereas invocation always seems to concern gods (i.e., assuming god-forms). Thus you invoke Mars in order to overcome and improve your own passive personality, but you evoke Andrealphus to teach you geometry. However, despite the \"angel craze\" of the last several years, there has been almost no explicit information in the literature con-cerning the invocation or evocation of angels. Since this encyclo-pedia contains the names and functions of hundreds of angels, a word on this subject may not be amiss. An angel may be said to be somewhere on the scale between a deity and an infernal being, at least as far as \"goodness\" is con-cerned, and probably also with regard to raw power. So what do you do with an angel—evoke or invoke? With demons, the answer is simple. No one in their right mind wants to be possessed by a demon, hence the clear answer is evocation. But being possessed temporarily by a benevolent entity like an angel can surely not be harmful in any way; quite the contrary, in fact. However, those who have been possessed by angels for one rea-son or another—particularly Enochian \"angels\"—report a rather unpleasant experience. The angels may be benevolent, but that"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Evocation of a spirit from La Veritable Dragon Rouge, Lille, 1521"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"xxxviii GODWIN'S CABALISTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA doesn't prevent them from using your body for their own purposes. Gods and goddesses, for some reason, do not seem to display this tendency—perhaps on the principle that those who already have ultimate power do not need to exercise control in such a blatant fash-ion. Or perhaps, because they are deities, they clearly understand that you are seeking the blessing of their more positive attributes. Angels, however, although they seldom if ever possess anyone against that person's will, seem to accept the invitation with relish and take the opportunity to gather information, give advice—per-haps even do good deeds—whether you particularly like it or not! Also remember that angels are messengers, agents, servants of some higher power. By invoking an angel, you make yourself sub-ject to that higher power in a subservient role. Naturally, the true magus considers himself or herself a servant of the Highest already, but invoking/becoming an angel involves giving up your free will in the matter. And there's always the chance that some-one, in summoning that angel, will summon you! Therefore, my advice as to having traffic with angels is always to evoke, never to invoke. When you invoke a deity, you assume his or her personality and attributes. When you invoke an angel, the angel assumes your body just as a demon would, but for pur-poses seen by the angel as \"good\" rather than \"evil.\" As for procedures, it is reasonable to assume that you evoke an angel in just exactly the same way that you evoke a demon, although perhaps with a greater measure of respect and awe. One commonly commands demons or demands something of them, although there is a school of thought that advises treating them as equals, or at least treating them with common courtesy. In any case, angels are to be addressed with respect. You should not threaten to cast them out of heaven if they disobey The appearance of angels, incidentally, is not necessarily the stereotyped image that you might expect. Many people have seen them as complex energy forms. Others are able to see them in forms that are in harmony with their \"telesmatic images,\" as determined by the spelling of their names. Each letter of the Hebrew alphabet has a wealth of associations. Taking the first letter as the top of the figure (head and shoulders) and the last letter as the bottom (feet and ankles), one can build up an image through these associations. The process is described in more detail in such books as The Golden"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxiii Dawn, but, to take a simple example, Mebahel (^^HDQ), angel of the second quinance of Libra, might appear like this: Q = above the waist, a reflective and dreamlike female figure 3 = the midsection of an active and trim man H = the legs and feet of an Amazon-like woman (fiery, strong) According to Golden Dawn doctrine, the suffix (or IT) is ignored for this purpose, although the N would denote wings. To conclude, the ceremonial magician who disdains the use of cabala and gematria is like a carpenter who tries to build a house without a hammer. Other Uses IN ADDITION to meditation and magic, the cabalistic system is uni-versally applicable in a surprising variety of fields not normally associated with anything of the kind. There is a certain amount of evidence that the cabala and the Tree of Life are present in the col-lective unconscious mind of every person, even if he/she has never heard of it. For example, before I had become even slightly acquainted with the cabala and knew nothing of the Tree of Life or the Sephiroth, I made a painting that I later discovered to be an excellent representation of the 24th path along with the adjoining Sephiroth of Tiphareth and Netzach, entirely accurate as to sym-bolism, relative placement, and even color. If the cabala is present as a system of archetypes in the unconscious of every individual, then it is not difficult to see how it can apply to virtually every area of occult and mental endeavor; not only magic (including Witchcraft) but also, for example, divination, character reading, dream interpretation, and meditation. Dream Interpretation The dreaming mind is apparently aware of the numerical corre-spondences of gematria and their significance, especially in the case of those who have become acquainted with the cabala.

As for divination, this ency-clopedia serves just as well as a tool for the intuition of the diviner as the Tarot, the I Ching, a horoscope, or any other method. Numbers very commonly occur in dreams as street addresses, telephone numbers, automobile license plates, room numbers, and so on; as a number of persons or things; or simply as abstract num-bers. It is a very straightforward matter to consult this book for the number in question and note the correspondences. For example, if you dream that you went to 175 Laurel Street and were set upon by seven dobermans, the dream could mean that you unconsciously love a certain person or that you have creative urges of which you are not aware. The numbers 175 and 7 are connected with the planet Venus and the Sephirah Netzach. If you had been aware of this attraction or urge, it would not have been thus veiled in a dream. The question of dream interpretation can become more sophis-ticated than the simple analysis of numbers that occur in dreams. For example, if you dream of seeing a tank full of colorful tropical fish, the natural (Jungian) psychological assumption would be that the fish represent interesting and attractive thoughts submerged in the unconscious mind (represented by water). But if you happen to know that the Hebrew for \"fish\" is dagim, or can find out that such is the case by the use of an inexpensive English-Hebrew dictionary, you can immediately arrive at the number 57 (or 617). Looking up the correspondences in this book, perhaps both in Section III and in the appended Sepher Sephiroth of Crowley, you find that these unconscious thoughts may very well present a terrible danger (OTN, terrible; , ruin; \"[IN, strength and wealth but also sor-row). There may be some connection between these thoughts and the \"liberal sciences\" (astrology, alchemy, etc.), since the number corresponds with both Alloces and Avnas, two demons who offer instruction in this area. Note also a connection with the Tarot's Five of Cups (disappointment). The dreamer would probably be well advised to become acquainted with these unconscious contents before they \"break loose\" and result in his obsession and ruination. Divination Divination is similar in method to the interpretation of numbers occurring in dreams. It is only necessary to arrive at a random number. The ideal way to do so, in my opinion, would be to obtain"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Introduction xxxiii three or four 10-sided dice to arrive at units, tens, hundreds, and thousands. (Of course, you have to decide which is which before-hand.) If, for example, you roll 0, 4,1, and 8, the resulting number is 418, not the simple addition, 13. Such dice are commonly used in fantasy role-playing games and are available at most game stores and some toy stores. A home computer can also be used to gener-ate random numbers. Of course, if the explanation of accurate divination is that the diviner discovers the requested information by telepathy or clair-voyance and then causes the dice (or coins or yarrow stalks or cards) to produce the appropriate result by unconscious manipu-lation or by psychokinesis, then the use of a computer is not too good—at least until such time as the operator learns to control electron flow psychokinetically. If, on the other hand, the explana-tion is that all events in the universe at any given time are related and in tune with one another, and hence any divination reflects those current conditions, then a computer (being, after all, a part of the universe) is as good as any other method. One example of divination that once came to my attention involved a young lady who was expecting a male visitor and inquired as to the results of going out with him. She used a \"dou-ble handful of [normal, six-sided] dice\" to generate a random number and then consulted this book. The resulting number was 88—and 88 = PIS = Pach = \"Snare, danger.\" In light of this result, the inquirer did not go out with the young man. It was later dis-covered that the fellow had been under the false impression that the girl had \"ratted\" on him to the \"narcs\" for dealing in marijuana and was consequently not a safe person for her to be around. Character Reading In order to do a character analysis in the style of astrology or palm reading, it is necessary to arrive at a cabalistic number for the name of the querent and then look up the correspondences. You can arrive at such a number by several methods, and almost all of nem are legitimate. Which one to use? It is essentially a matter of personal preference and intuition, but it may be helpful to try out all the possibilities. Unfortunately, my experience with this technique has been that 1 is really not very helpful. Theoretically, I suppose it should be,"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"xxxviii GODWIN'S CABALISTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA but in fact it is not. This may be because the names dealt with are usually not Hebrew and have to be forcibly altered to fit the sys-tem. (With few exceptions, no non-Semitic name can be written with Hebrew characters in a perfectly straightforward manner). It may also have something to do with the angelic guardians or rulers of cabala, who thwart efforts to turn this sacred knowledge into a \"parlor game.\" However, if you wish to give it a try on your own, methods of converting English names to Hebrew and an example of character analysis are given in Appendix I. It is helpful at times to remember that there is a certain amount of legitimate \"fudging\" that may be done in all these analyses, whether dream interpretation, divination, or character analysis. For example, the value of any Hebrew noun can be increased by 5 sim-ply by adding the definite article \"the\" in front of it; that is, the letter Heh (11). Hence, Bath, PQ, 402, daughter, but Ha-Bath, rQH, 407, the daughter. A good deal of manipulation can be achieved by the use of prefixes—one- or two-letter conjunctions, articles, and preposi-tions. The letter in question is simply \"tacked on\" to the beginning of any noun. (There is a similar procedure with pronoun suffixes, but that is slightly too complex to enter into in this brief discussion.)

As for Sepher Sephiroth, Crowley had access to sources no longer in print, most notably Knorr von Rosen-roth's Kabbala Denudata in its original Latin. But beware of errors and double-check Crowley's addition, for his work is not always 100% accurate. Come to that, there is no way that anyone can produce a work of this nature with no errors whatsoever, so you are also advised to double-check my spelling and addition as well! While on the subject, I feel I must say something about what appear to be cheap anti-Semitic sentiments expressed by Crowley in his preface to Sepher Sephiroth. In part, this defamation refers to an unfortunate essay (\"The Jew\") by the English explorer Sir Richard Burton, who, with his Sufi training, should have known better. As for Crowley, there is always some doubt as to whether he is serious. Elsewhere, he has praised Jews for having exceptional and admirable qualities. Perhaps the preface here was meant to satirize Burton and the readiness of the English upper middle class to believe the worst about the Jews (and just about everyone else). With Crowley, one never knows. In any event, it would have been dishonest to expurgate the preface from the rest of the work. In conclusion, it is my firm hope that those interested in these matters will find this encyclopedia an invaluable and helpful text. —DAVID GODWIN"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"SECTION I ENGLISH AND TRANSLITERATED HEBREW"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"A 887 or 237 Sigil of A'ano'nin 906 or 256 A'abiriron—see Abiriron A'amamiah—see Amamiah A'aneval—see Anevel A'ano'nin— The guardian of the 26th Tunnel of Set.

Roman Catholics recognize seven additional books (or, prior to official acceptance of the canon of the Jersusalem Bible, 14). The Hebrew scriptures (i.e., the Tanakh) are divided into three main categories, the initials of which spell out the word Tanakh. These divisions are (1) the Pentateuch, the Five Books of Moses, or the Torah (miri), law (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy); (2) the Prophets Neviim (•\"WD]), including the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, I and II Samuel, and I and II Kings) and the Latter Prophets, which are subdivided into the three Major Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel) and the twelve Minor Prophets (Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah, and Malachi); and (3) the Hagiographia, Ketuvim (D,D1DD) (Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Ruth, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Ecclesastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and I and II Chronicles).

It contains the names and descriptions of 72 demons under the authority of Amaimon (East), Korson or Corson (West), Zimimay (North), and Goap (South). There is no established Hebrew spelling of these names; in general, I have used those of Crowley (777), with a few obvious corrections, constructing the spelling myself for the four kings. As to the correctness of the gematria involved, one should bear in mind that all such constructed spellings are by their nature somewhat arbitrary, as is the assignment of the demons to the decanates or quinances of the Zodiac. Most attempts to render the names in Hebrew delete the Greek and Latin endings (-us, -as, -ion) so that \"Furcas,\" for example, becomes \"Furk\" fplS), \"Dantalion\" becomes \"Dantal\" ftWDH), etc. There has been some attempt in recent years to present these entities as \"spirits\" or \"daimons\" who may be dealt with as morally neutral entities or forces. This approach chooses to ignore the fact that the original Judaeo-Christian conception of the Goetia was that these were 72 fallen angels who had followed Lucifer in his revolt and who now dwelt in hell. In any case, considering the fact that so many of them are concerned with things such as causing wounds to fester, procuring sex, bringing about hatred, and the like, they can hardly be said to be well-intentioned.

The \"moral\" is that one should control and utilize one's objectionable qualities in a constructive manner rather than being controlled by them.

Indeed, it must also be acknowledged that some of the names are plainly corrupted forms of the deities of pagan religions (e.g., Haures = Horus, Ashtaroth = Astarte, and so on). The idea that these beings are demonic may be nothing more than Judaeo-Christian propaganda. As noted, the astrological assignments of the demons differs according to various authorities. Following is a list of the demons in order along with their astrological correspondences according to both Aleister Crowley (777) and the order Aurum Solis (see The Sword and the Serpent by Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips). Crowley assigns the spirits to the decanates, each 10° segment being given a demon by day and a demon by night. The Aurum Solis, on the other hand, assigns the demons to the quinances. Also given are the Hebrew spellings, which vary somewhat between the two sources. It will be seen that Crowley begins with the first decanate of Aries—a reasonable enough approach—taking first all the demons by day and then the last 36 as demons by night. The Aurum Solis, on the other hand, follows the usual methodology of MacGregor Mathers by starting out with the first quinance of Leo. For some reason, however, the Aurum Solis does not proceed in exact sequence but rather takes first the odd-numbered quinances and only then starts over with the even-numbered quinances at 5-10° Aries. 1.

Only Asa, Jeohoshaphat, Joash, Amaziah, Azariah, Jotham, Hezekiah, and Josiah (8 out of 19) \"did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord,\" namely smashing idols and burning groves dedicated to the Goddess. Despite Biblical inerrancy, there are a few apparent con-tradictions in these king lists.

Their addition to the tradition makes no more sense than discarding Fire, Water, Air, and Earth in favor of the 92+ elements of the periodic table. Efforts to shoehorn new scientific data into an established esoteric symbology are misguided attempts to force mysticism to conform to the details of the physical universe. There is nothing symbolized by these planets that was absent from the human psy-che before their discovery or that was not already adequately symbolized by existing structures. Even in astrology, attempts to work additional planets into the system of rulerships and dignities have made hash out of the elegance and symmetry of the older scheme. In cabala, the absurdity of the whole approach is exemplified by the rather silly equation of Pluto = Kether; i.e., revolutionary change = undiffer-entiated Oneness! From planet Earth, these outer planets are invisible to the naked eye. They should remain so in esoteric thought. OX—see Aleph, Shor Oz—lU 1. Strength 2. Violence 3.

Levi became the priestly caste, not one of the 12 tribes, while Joseph split into two tribes named after the sons of Joseph: Manasseh and Ephraim. Jacob's first wife was Leah, and she was the mother of Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebu-lun; these are called the \"Leah tribes.\" Leah's hand-maiden, Zilpah, was the mother of Gad and Asher. Jacob's second wife, Rachel, was the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, while her handmaiden Bilhah was the mother of Dan and Naphtali. The mother of Joseph's sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, was Asen-ath, daughter of Potipherah, Egyptian priest of On, but they are considered \"Rachel tribes\" because of their grandmother. The 12 tribes of Israel and their associated astrological signs (according to Albert Pike and MacGregor Mathers on the one hand— expressing the tradition of Freemasonry—and Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi [Warren Kenton]) on the other, and the associated jewels on the breastplate of the High Priest, are as follows (the order of the tribes is that given in the second chapter of Numbers): Tribe Masonic Halevi Jewel Mother Judah Leo  Aries sardius Leah Issachar Cancer Taurus topaz Leah Zebulun Capricorn Gemini carbuncle Leah"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"312 TRANSLITERATED HEBREW Tribe Masonic Halevi Jewel Mother Reuben Aquarius Cancer emerald Leah Simeon Pisces Leo sapphire Leah Gad Aries Virgo diamond Zilpah Ephraim Taurus Libra ligure Rachel Manasseh Gemini Scorpio agate Rachel Benjamin Sagittarius Sagittarius amethyst Rachel Dan Scorpio Capricorn beryl Bilhah Asher Libra Aquarius onyx Zilpah Naphtali Virgo Pisces jasper Bilhah At first glance, Halevi's list may seem more logical, but Pike's—correctly in my opinion—attributes the four main tribes or camps—Judah (East), Reuben (South), Ephraim (West), and Dan (North)—to the fixed signs of the Zodiac, the four tetramorphs of the vision of Ezekiel; namely, Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius (bull, lion, eagle, and man).

This universe, perceived as evil by those of us who remain unenlightened, seems to be overrun with dis-eases, demons, and danger, and is mapped on the"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Tribe - Tunnels of Set 313 \"Tree of Death\" (see Qlippoth). These tunnels underlie and correspond to the 22 Paths of the Tree of Life, although Grant seems to indicate that their true meaning lies in symbolic descriptions of 22 varieties of etheric vaginal secretions (kalas) during Tantric intercourse—a doctrine which I personally find rather neurotic, obsessive, silly, and beside the point. Each Tunnel (also called a kala) has a guardian (i.e., one of the genii of the 22 scales). Those attributed to the signs of the Zodiac by the standard Golden Dawn method also have an associated host of qlippoth; the others may or may not be inhabited by swarms of other demonic creatures in a rather ill-defined fash-ion (e.g., vampiric sylphs in the 11th Tunnel, ravening beasts in the 31st Tunnel, and so on). The Hebrew spellings of the names of the guardians are my own, but they are based upon Grant's enumera-tions (he gives the name and the number, but not the Hebrew spelling). In some cases (e.g., Dagdagiel), this spelling is obvious and straightforward. In sev-eral other cases (e.g., Kurgasiax), a certain amount of violence has to be done to standard Hebrew orthog-raphy in order to achieve the given enumeration. However, since we are dealing with (a) the qlippoth and (b) the mental processes of Kenneth Grant, this is only to be expected.

Since the Name is too holy to be pronounced by the profane (even if they know how), the name Adonai (\"Lord\") is substituted when reading Hebrew scripture. As a reminder that this is to be done, iT)iT is written with the vowel points for Adonai. This practice formerly led translators to ren-der the Name erroneously as \"Jehovah.\" At some point, scholarly opinion stated that the probable pronunciation was \"Yahveh\" or \"Yahweh,\" but, in view of the sanctity of the Name and the secrecy surrounding it, this seems improbable. Robert Graves (The White Goddess) suggested that the Name represents four vowels and is possibly a form of shorthand for seven vowels as in the Greek alphabet (aeriLouw). It has also been suggested that !T)iV is an acronym (notariqon) for something much longer, or represents some sort of cipher (temurah).

Even then, the results may tax your intuitive powers. The information you do obtain, however, may conceivably be very significant and will tend to indicate not only the more important features of the individual's character but also directions and warnings concerned with personal conduct and with the inner men-tal or spiritual life. The one feature of the cabala and of gematria that you should not forget is that everything can be understood on many levels. The simplest method is the use of standard popular numerology whereby everything is reduced to one digit (for example, 418 = 4 + 1+8 = 13 and 1 + 3 = 4). In my opinion, this method is a bit oversimplified and the results too general to be of much use. In any case, it is not cabalism nor gematria. Another method is to number the letters of the English alphabet and then add the letters of the name in question. This has a cer-tain validity, particularly if you wish to generate a dictionary of English words enumerated by one of these methods, but it is only marginally related to the cabala. So we are left with altering the letters of the name to Hebrew. One method for this transliteration is to spell the name as if it were Hebrew, substituting the appropriate phonetic values. In this way, the sounds of the letters are preserved. For example, \"Smith\" would be flOD, or possibly DQtZJ. (The Hebrew letter Shin can be pronounced either as S or Sh.) Of course, Hebrew has no vowels, only diacritical marks that indicate vowels. These marks have no numerical values. Nevertheless, as early as Biblical times, the practice arose of substituting a consonant for a vowel when it was thought necessary to clarify a word: Aleph (fc) for A, Vav (1) 645"},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"646 GODWIN'S CABALISTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA for U or O, and Yod (') for I. This was usually done only in the case of a long vowel, but sometimes in the case of a short vowel if it occurred in an accented syllable. Therefore, the spellings rPQO or JTftE? are also accept-able. \"Godwin\" could be piTO, or even flTl. Also note that the final Nun can be legitimately counted as either 50 or 700. The only difficulty with the phonetic method is that some sounds in English have no Hebrew equivalent, and vice-versa. We have no Aleph or Ayin sound, and do not differentiate between hard and soft consonants (Teth and Tau, Samekh and Shin, and so on). If you are trying to transliter-ate a name such as \"Charles,\" do you represent the Ch by Cheth, com-monly transliterated Ch, but which has little resemblance to the English phonetic value, or do you try to approximate the actual sound more accu-rately by Shin, or still more accurately by Teth-Shin or Tau-Shin? Such difficulties are avoided by another method—the one usually preferred by Aleister Crowley—that uses the Hebrew letter from which the English letter evolved through Phoenician, Greek, and Latin. In this case, there may not be much relationship between the way the name is pronounced and the way it is spelled, but the visible forms of the letters are preserved; that is to say, their archetypal, pre-Creation essence devoid of such mundane attributes and associations as phonetic values. In this system, Smith becomes IT ft© or even nrPfttZJ, while \"Godwin\" becomes Western cabalists are not always overly precise with this method, and sometimes the Hebrew letter with the correct phonetic value may be used instead of the letter from which, strictly speaking, the English letter was derived. Hence, for Smith, ITftC or possibly ntD'QO would be acceptable, using Samekh instead of Shin for the S. For the sake of convenience and reference, here is a table showing the various enumerations that may be given to each English letter. Note that only the first two methods (\"Hebrew Phonetic and Hebrew Origin\") have much value in cabalistic interpretations, although the other three meth-ods may be useful in a strictly English numerology.

As for enumerating English names by spelling them in Hebrew, another possibility is to translate the name directly, if possible. Thus, \"Smith\" becomes Charash (BTH\"J, 508) and \"Godwin,\" Anglo-Saxon for \"friend of God,\" becomes Reuel pRliTl, 307). It is apparent why Crowley preferred the \"origin\" method, inasmuch as it was by this enumeration that he evaluated his own name (with the seldom-used middle initial E) as 666, the Beast: TI^HTD il \"inCDDTFTW."},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"Appendix A—Character Reading 649 H. P. Lovecraft As an example of character reading—and its confusions and limita-tions—let us take the name of Howard Phillips Lovecraft, the well-known author of a number of weird tales. By the phonetic method, this becomes: nsiDTi1? osfrs -nnn (1223) But Phillips could just as well be spelled tDD'TS (since Shin can be either S or Sh), and the final letter of Lovecraft could just as easily be Tau as Teth. It would likewise be legitimate to count the c in Lovecraft as Qoph. By using all the combinations of these variables, we can come up with a dozen enumerations. But we must also consider the fact that all of Lovecraft's stories are always attributed to \"H. P. Lovecraft,\" so we need to get values for \"H. P.\" with the four possible spellings of Lovecraft—436, 516, 827, and 907. Out of these four, I would pick 827 as the most likely to be significant (nsiDnb a n). By the \"origin\" method, we get: maimr1? EJE^TIS nwrn (1558) As mentioned before, it is legitimate to make some phonetic substi-tutions in this method, as Crowley did in his own name, particularly in view of the fact that no fewer than five letters of our alphabet (F, U, V, W, and Y) came from the single Hebrew letter Vav or Waw (V or W) through the Greek upsilon and digamma. To me, the spelling ... nstn:>mri? BEF^TT© TIKWI (1643) ... seems generally preferable, if only for esthetic reasons. In any event, there are at least two ways to spell Howard, six ways to spell Phillips, and six ways to spell Lovecraft by this method, depending on how letters are transliterated, and thus no fewer than 84 enumera-tions! I would choose nSSIDm^b S il (897) as the most likely and the most important of the lot. Note that, in Hebrew, a doubled consonant is indicated by a diacriti-cal mark, not by writing the letter twice, and it is only counted once. But in the letter-by-letter method, L occurs twice in Phillips and therefore Lamed may be used twice—but it is also acceptable to use it only once, if you care to multiply the enumerations even further. And, if the subject has a name ending with one of the letters that can have either of two val-"},{"pageNumber":698,"pageContent":"650 GODWIN'S CABALISTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA ues as a final consonant, the number of enumerations is doubled. Such is not the case with our example, however. And, of course, there are also nicknames—\"Ed,\" \"Bill,\" etc. In the present case, Lovecraft did not have any nicknames as such, but he often signed his letters Grandpa, Theobald, Theobaldus, or Grandpa Theobald. This might almost be regarded as his \"magical name.\" Phonetically, we have -frmn KBTana (781), and, by the \"origin\" method, nb^finn KEnama (859) (or -friornnn or •faajnri). Not only that, but it might be advisable to translate \"Grandpa\" into Hebrew—sab, sab', or ab zaqen; that is, 3D, K30, or jpT DK. Numerically, that is 62, 63, 160, or (counting Nun as final) 810. (Note that 63 = \"Dagon,\" the title of the first story of Lovecraft's to be published in Weird Tales.) It might be possible to mix the Hebrew words with the letter-ori-gins method, but it does not seem appropriate to do so—either the name is taken as Hebrew or it isn't. Lovecraft often signed his letters simply \"HPL\" (^Dil, 115; or, by let-ter origins, 118), and frequently spelled this out phonetically so that it resembled the name of an ancient wizard—\"Ech Pi El.\" This can be rep-resented phonetically as 'D ©UK (431 = BS-|plt>), BHtf (822 = nS-ipYD), or bx 'D ilN (130), and, by the letter-origin method as bn 'D nan (i4i). Thus, by the phonetic method, we arrive at 21 enumerations, after eliminating duplicates. We get 87 different enumerations by the \"origins\" method, and a further eight when we resort to translation. Not only that, but we can translate \"Lovecraft\" (love + craft) as ahbah Umanuth (rVUDltf ronN, 516, which happens to be the same as QEIpllb D H) and start combining that with H. P. and the various phonetic spellings of \"Howard Phillips.\" Surely some of these numbers must be better than others! They are, of course; I have indicated a couple of choices above. But this is a charac-ter reading, not a determination of the most significant number. Perhaps a panoply of enumerations to work with will better enable the diviner to form general impressions and then work down to specifics. Why wouldn't random numbers do just as well? Indeed, with proper concentration by the proper scryer, they would—but at least the numbers generated by this method are sure to be actually related to the subject at hand in some way to begin with. If we take 827 as the most important and probable enumeration (that is, re-on1? s il), we find only one correspondence- —the Garden of Eden! What are we to make of this? Paradise before the Fall seems a strange result for a writer of terrifying tales of eldritch horrors! But, remember, we are doing a character reading, not a literary analysis."},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"Appendix A—Character Reading 651 All his life, Lovecraft longed for the Providence of his childhood, and his fiction describes it in glowing terms in several stories, perhaps most notably the novel-length Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath. The house of his boyhood in an unspoiled Providence, Rhode Island—that is HPL's Eden, from which home the child and his mother had to move after the death of his grandfather and from which he was \"driven,\" even as the Perizzites (OHS 897 = nDfcODnW1?) and Hittites (OTin, 1018 = BDtODmin OSTTPTID Tiaum) were driven from Palestine. Thus begins a typical analysis. It could be carried much further, of course, by considering all the numbers involved, looking up their corre-spondences in Section III and in Crowley's Sepher Sephiroth. Write down the correspondences and then let them all churn around in your subcon-scious for a while, and see what you get! This is the procedure to follow with any name with which you may choose to deal, and it goes without saying that, the better you are at div-ination by other methods, the better results you will get with this one. This discussion of character reading has probably received more space than it deserves, particularly in view of its doubtful nature, but it can be understood only very poorly without such a demonstration. I feel that it may have possibilities that I have not properly understood or explored."},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"Appendix B Decanates of the Zodiac Each sign of the Zodiac occupies 30 degrees (i.e., one-twelfth of 360 degrees). Each sign is further divided into three \"decanates\" or \"decans\" of 10 degrees each. Thus there are 36 decanates in the Zodiac. Each decanate corresponds to one of the numbered cards (2 through 9) of the Tarot, and each decanate is ruled by a planet. The traditional rulerships, however, differ from those used in the Her-metic Order of the Golden Dawn. In astrology, the first decanate is always ruled by the planet ruling the sign. In the Golden Dawn, however, the planets follow one another in their normal order (i.e., by speed of apparent motion), beginning with Saturn for the first decanate of Leo. The Golden Dawn Zodiac, as most students are aware, does not begin with 0° Aries, but rather with 0° Leo, which is defined as the star Regulus. Hence precession does not affect the Golden Dawn Zodiac—which, however, bears no straightforward rela-tionship to the Equinoxes and Solstices. By current astrological reckoning, Regulus is at 29°45' Leo (increasing at the rate of 50.27\" every year). To convert the usual geocentric astrological positions to Golden Dawn values, it would therefore be necessary to subtract 29°45'. Hence the Vernal Equinox, rather than occurring at 0° Aries, takes place at 0°15' Pisces. (In making this conversion, the degree in question must be converted to the 360° scale. For example, 0° Aquarius is at 300° of the 360° Zodiac, so 9°33' Aquarius would convert to 309°33'. Sub-tracting 29°45', we arrive at 279°48' on the ecliptic, which is 9°38' Capricorn on the Golden Dawn Zodiac. 653"},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"654 GODWIN'S CABALISTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA The Golden Dawn Zodiac is somewhat closer to the sidereal Zodiac; however, the correspondence is far from exact because the normal sidereal Zodiac is in no way tied to Regulus and varies with precession.

In the 17th century, a document appeared, attached to the Sepher Yetzirah as if an original part of it, called \"The Thirty-Two Paths of Wisdom.\" This text speaks of each Path as being an \"intelligence\" (sehkel) and then describes it in rather cryptic terms; for example, \"The Twenty-sixth Path [i.e., Tiphareth to Hod] is called the Renovating Intelligence, because the Holy God renews by it all the changing things which are renewed by the creation of the world\" (Westcott, 1887). Many occultists claim to find this document extremely helpful, especially in determining the correspondences between the Hebrew letters and the trumps of the Tarot. The letters were attributed to the Paths of the Tree by the Golden Dawn according to a quite useful and workable system that has been followed throughout this book. This is the system that is in almost universal use today for pathworking, the Her-metic cabala, and ceremonial magic. It was the system used by MacGregor Mathers, Aleister Crowley, and Dion Fortune. It is used today by BOTA and other organizations that had their origins associated with the Golden Dawn. Crowley's \"magical son,\" Charles Stansfield Jones (\"Frater Achad\") was inspired to revamp the system from bottom to top, with aleph assigned to the 32nd Path and tau to the 11th, although he retained the correspondences of the Path numbers with the letters 657"},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"658 NUMERICAL INDEX by renumbering the Paths from bottom to top. For example, Achad's \"11th Path\" (aleph) runs from Malkuth to Yesod. Crowley thought this method was nonsense involving \"supreme atrocities,\" but it has its merits, and some groups now working still use this system. In 1936, C.C. Zain (i.e., Elbert Benjamine), founder of the Broth-erhood of Light, brought out an entirely different system that more or less ignored the astrological and planetary attributions accord-ing to mother, double, and single letters. Zain's system was keyed to the Tarot rather than to the Tree, however. Despite all this, the assignment of the letters to the Paths made by the great cabalist Isaac Luria in the 16th century probably makes more sense than any other method and is much more elegant and appealing. He put the three mother letters on the three horizontal Paths of the Tree, the seven double letters on the seven vertical Paths, and the 12 single letters on the 12 diagonal Paths. Isaac's ver-sion of the Tree is also slightly different. He had only one Path lead-ing to Malkuth (the one from Yesod), but he had Paths connecting Chokmah with Geburah and Binah with Chesed. This also makes more sense, as it provides a Path for the Lightning Flash and indi-cates that following the Path of the Middle Pillar is the only way you can even begin to approach God. Even in the Golden Dawn, the 30th and 31st Paths were closed to the Neophyte. Isaac Luria's Tree is shown on the opposite page, and the table on page 660 shows the assignment of the elements, planets, and signs to the letters (the \"Yetziratic attributions\") according to the Golden Dawn and also according to most versions of the addenda to the Sepher Yetzirah, which Isaac also followed. It is not true, how-ever, that the Tree with three Paths going to Malkuth is a Christian invention. In fact, it is one of the oldest forms of the Tree. Logically, Christians should prefer the Tree that shows only \"one way\" from Malkuth, that which leads through Yesod to Jesus in Tiphareth. Despite the esthetic appeal of the \"Luria tree,\" however, no one to my knowledge has bothered to use it in working out a system of correspondences as elaborate as that of the Golden Dawn, and—at least for the time being—the Golden Dawn system remains the more useful of the two for purposes of magic and pathworking."},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"660 NUMERICAL INDEX Attributions of the Letters Golden Dawn Sepher Yetzirah* Letter Attribution Path** Attribution Path Aleph Air 11 Air 19 Beth Mercury 12 Saturn 16 Gimel Moon 13 Jupiter 18 Daleth Venus 14 Mars 13 Heh Aries 15 Aries 11 Vau Taurus 16 Taurus 12 Zayin Gemini 17 Gemini (2-5)** Cheth Cancer 18 Cancer 20 Teth Leo 19 Leo 15 Yod Virgo 20 Virgo 24 Kaph Jupiter 21 Sun 21 Lamed Libra 22 Libra 30 Mem Water 23 Water 27 Nun Scorpio 24 Scorpio 28 Samekh Sagittarius 25 Sagittarius 26 Ayin Capricorn 26 Capricorn 17 Peh Mars 27 Venus 23 Tzaddi Aquarius 28 Aquarius 22 Qoph Pisces 29 Pisces (3-4)** Resh Sun 30 Mercury 25 Shin Fire 31 Fire 14 Tau Saturn 32 Moon 32 \"This information was added at a much later date and cannot be said to be a part of the original Sepher Yetzirah.

Nevertheless, .for the sake of establishing some sort of standard reference system within this book, the more familiar path numbering of the Golden Dawn is used here in all instances. Be that as it may, there are two paths on the Luria Tree that do not exist on the Golden Dawn Tree.

And no doubt such opponents of the modern Jew will acclaim this volume as an admirable disproof of that thesis which it purports to uphold. The dissimilarities, amounting in some cases to sheer contradiction, which mark many numbers, will appear proof positive that there is nothing in the numerical Qabalah, especially as we may presume that by filling up this dictionary from the ordinary Hebrew Lexicon one would arrive at a mere hotch-pot. Apart from this, there is a deeper-lying objection to the Qabalah; vi2., that the theory is an example of the fallacy Post hoc propter hoc. Are we to believe, asks the sceptic, that a number of learned men deliberately sat down and chose words for the sake of their numerical value ? Language is a living thing, with many sources and diverse; can it be moulded in any such arbitrary fashion ? The only reply seems to be a mere assertion that to some extent it certainly is so. Examples of a word being spelt deliberately wrong do occur; and such a jugglery as the changing of the names Abram and Sarai to Abraham and Sarah can hardly be purposeless. Once admit the end of such a wedge, and it is difficult to say whether it may not be driven home so far as to split asunder the Tree of Knowledge, if not the Tree of Life. Another line of argument is the historical. We do not here refer to the alleged forgery of the Qabalah by Rabbi Moses ben Leon—was it not ?—but to the general position of the ethnologist that the Jews were an entirely barbarous race, incapable of any spiritual pursuit. That they were polytheists is clear from the very first verse of Genesis; that Adonai Melekh is identical with \" Moloch \" ls known to every Hebraist. The \" Old Testament\" is mainly the history of the struggle of the phallic Jehovah against the rest of the Elohim, and that his sacrifices were of blood, and human blood at that, is indisputable."},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"PREFACE Human sacrifices are to-day still practised by the Jews of Eastern Europe, as is set forth at length by the late Sir Richard Burton in the MS. which the wealthy Jews of England have compassed heaven and earth to suppress, and evidenced by the ever-recurring Pogroms against which so senseless an outcry is made by those who live among those degenerate Jews who are at least not cannibals. Is it to such people, indeed, that we are to look for the highest and subtlest spiritual knowledge ? To this criticism there are but two answers. The first, that an esoteric tradition of great purity may co-exist with the most crass exoteric practice. Witness the Upanishads in the land of Jagganath, hook-swinging, and the stupidest forms of Hatha-Yoga. Witness the Tipitaka (with such perfections as the Dhammapada) in the midst of peoples whose science of torture would seem to have sprung from no merely human imagination. The descriptions in the Tipitaka itself of the Buddhist Hells are merely descriptions of the actual tortures inflicted by the Buddhists on their enemies. The second, that after all is said, I find it work very well. I do not care whether J — i is an impossible, an unimaginable thing, or whether de Moivre really invented it, and if so, whether de Moivre was an immoral man, and wore whiskers. It helps me to make certain calculations; and so long as that is so, it is useful, and I stick to it. Other criticisms of the methods of the Qabalah itself have been made and disposed of in the article on the subject in \" The Temple of Solomon the King (Equinox V) and no further reference need be made to them in this place. It is only necessary to say that that article should be studied most thoroughly, and also the article \" A Note on Genesis \" in the second number of The Equinox. With these two weapons, and the Sword of the Spirit, the Practicus, fully armed, may adventure himself in the great battle wherein victory is Truth.

It was bequeathed to the present Editor, with many other magical MSS., on I.A.'s departure for Ceylon in 1899. Frater Perdurabo used it, and largely added to it, in the course of his Qabalistic workings. With George Cecil Jones (Fra.'. Volo Noscere) he further added to it by making it a complete cross-correspondence to the Book DCCLXXVII. It was further revised and checked, re-copied by a Jewish scribe, and again checked through, in the year V of the present Era. The mathematical additions were continued by Fra .\\ P. and Fra .\\ Lampada Tradam; and the MS. finally copied on a specially constructed typewriter by Gerald Rae Fraser (Fra yfr) who added yet further mathematical data. This copy has again been checked by Fra/. P. and SororN.N. and the proofs further by three separate scholars. The method of employing the dictionary has been fully indicated in The Temple of Solomon the King [Equinox V]. None of the editors claim to possess even the smallest degree of scholarship. The method of compilation has been to include all words given in Von Rosen-roth's Qabalistic Dictionary, those specially commented on in S.D., I.R.Q., and I Z'Q-, those given in 777, and those found by Fratres I.A. and P.

Elements of Greek phi-losophy summarize the bulk of modern esoteric thought and occult teachings. Even the cabala contains many features that appear to be Greek in origin. The systems formulated by the direct progenitors of Western culture speak to the modern soul of the Western world. This book explains in plain, informal language the grand sweep of Greek magic and Greek philosophical and religious concepts from the archaic period of Homer's Iliad right down to the present. It begins with the magic and mythology of the days of classical Athens and its antecedent cultures, gives detailed considerations of Gnosticism, early Christianity and Neoplatonism—all phenomena with a Greek foundation— explains the manifestations of Greek thought in the Renais-sance, and explores modern times with the Greek elements of the magic of the Golden Dawn, Aleister Crowley and others. For the practicing magician, rituals are given that incorporate elements from each historical period that is discussed. These ceremonies may be easily adapted for Pagan or Wiccan prac-tice or otherwise altered to suit the individual operator. From the plains of Troy to the streets of Los Angeles, Greek magic is alive and well. No one who has any interest in magic, occultism, or hermetic thought and who is also a citi-zen of Western civilization can afford to ignore this heritage. 0-87542-285-3, 272 pgs., 6x9, illus., softcover $12.95 Prices subject to change without notice."},{"pageNumber":833,"pageContent":"THE GOLDEN DAWN The Original Account of the Teachings, Rites & Ceremonies of the Hermetic Order As revealed by Israel Regardie Complete in one volume with further revision, expansion, and additional notes by Regardie, Cris Monnastre, and oth-ers. Expanded with an index of more than 100 pages! Originally published in four bulky volumes of some 1,200 pages, this 6th Revised and Enlarged Edition has been entirely reset in modern, less space-consuming type, in half the pages (while retaining the original pagination in marginal notation for reference) for greater ease and use. Corrections of typographical errors perpetuated in the origi-nal and subsequent editions have been made, with further revision and additional text and notes by noted scholars and by actual practitioners of the Golden Dawn system of Mag-ick, with an Introduction by the only student ever accepted for personal training by Regardie. Also included are Initiation Ceremonies, important rituals for consecration and invocation, methods of meditation and magical working based on the Enochian Tablets, studies in the Tarot, and the system of Qabalistic Correspondences that unite the World's religions and magical traditions into a com-prehensive and practical whole.

It's the ground plan of the Qabalistic system—a set of symbols used since ancient times to study the Universe. The Tree of Life is a geometrical arrangement of ten sephiroth, or spheres, each of which is associated with a different archetypal idea, and 22 paths which connect the spheres.This system of primal correspondences has been found the most efficient plan ever devised to classify and organize the characteristics of the self. Israel Regardie has written one of the best and most lucid introductions to the Qabalah. A Garden of Pomegranates com-bines Regardie's own studies with his notes on the works of Aleister Crowley, A. E. Waite, Eliphas Levi and D. H. Lawrence. No longer is the wisdom of the Qabalah to be held secret! The needs of today place the burden of growth upon each and every person ... each has to undertake the Path as his or her own responsibility, but every help is given in the most ancient and yet most modern teaching here known to humankind. 0-87542-690-5,160 pgs., 5 'A x 8, softcover   $8.95   THE GOLDEN DAWN JOURNAL Book One: Divination edited by Chic Cicero and Sandra Tabatha Cicero The Golden Dawn Journal is an ongoing series of books designed to reflect the magical teachings and philosophy of the Hermetic Tradition. The books will seriously explore the techniques used in ceremonial magick and include practical ritual advice for the working magician. Each vol-ume will focus on one theme, with contributions by various authors experienced in Western ceremonial magic. Book One: Divination explores how and why the process of divination works, traditional techniques of Tarot and Geomancy (along with new information on both), new Tarot spreads, historical information derived from the actual Tarot readings of an original member of th Golden Dawn, explorations of both Roman and Graeco-Egyptian divinatory techniques, Gypsy Runes, and new systems of divination developed by accom-plished magicians in the field. All authors then respond to the question, \"Can a Divination Always Be Trusted?\" As both an order and a Magickal Tradition, the Golden Dawn is respon-sible for planting many of the seeds of Magick that have sprouted today in the form of numerous Magickal organizations throughout the world. 1-56718-850-8, 288 pgs., 6x9, softcover   $12.00   Prices subject to change without notice."},{"pageNumber":836,"pageContent":"Your A-Z Guide to the Cabala As you traverse your spiritual path and ponder the universal schema, don't forget to take along Godwin's Cabalistic Encyclopedia.
