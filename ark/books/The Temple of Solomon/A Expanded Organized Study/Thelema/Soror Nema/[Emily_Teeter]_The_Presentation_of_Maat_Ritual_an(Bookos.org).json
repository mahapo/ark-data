Be that as is it may, specific acknowledgments are due to so many who helped me formulate andpresent the ideas herein. Foremost are Edward F. Wente, Lanny Bell, Helene Kantort, and Klaus Baert. Eachrelied upon their own expertise and interests to provide me with invaluable guidance on uncountable matters. Ithank them for their support and especially for their unflagging interest in the completion of this study. A veryspecial debt is owed to Klaus Baer, whose untimely death did not allow him to see the result of hisrecommendations on methodology which charted the path of this work.This work relies heavily upon the study of unpublished materials at Thebes. The American Research Centerin Egypt and Paul Walker (then Executive Director) are to be thanked a thousand times over because as a Fellowof the American Research Center in Egypt in 1985/86 I was able to collect the basic materials for this study.Special thanks go to the staff of the American Research Center in Egypt's Cairo office, Richard Verdery (thenDirector) and Amira Khattab and Salah Adin Mohammed Mettwally in particular for the myriad tasks theyaccomplished on my behalf. I extend the deepest thanks to the Egyptian Antiquities Organization and to AhmedKadryt, then Chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization and the Permanent Committee, for their kindpermission to pursue fieldwork, and to Mohammed el-Sughayyar, Chief Inspector of Upper Egypt, for his efficienthandling of my special requests. Very special and heartfelt thanks are extended to Lanny Bell (then Director ofChicago House in Luxor) for his hospitality, not only for office space and use of the institute's vast resources, butalso for so many pleasant evenings. So, too, I thank Donald Redford of University of Toronto and Jean-ClaudeGoyon and Jean-Claude Golvin of the Centre Franco-6gyptien at Karnak for their help and permission to examinethe Amama-era materials. Robert Vergnieux, then Directeur Adjoin of the Centre Franco-6gyptien d'itudes desTemples de Karnak, was especially helpful in my study of the talatat.While in Cairo, Paule Posener-Kri6ger graciously allowed me access to the Institut Franqais d'ArchdologieOrientale's unpublished Deir el-Medina materials which Anne Gout put at my immediate disposal. More recently,Peter Dorman, former Field Director of the Epigraphic Survey, and W. Raymond Johnson, now Field Director ofthe same mission, made pre-publication drawings of the Opet scenes available to me. I profited by discussionswith them about the Eighteenth Dynasty materials from Thebes.Many materials were kindly supplied by museums throughout the United States and Europe. I would like toacknowledge the help of Christiane Desroches-Noblecourt of the Mus6e du Louvre, W.

With Maat's emphasis upon tradition and unchanging val-ues, she provided the sense of continuity that ensured the permanence of many features of ancient Egyptianculture. Although there has been considerable discussion of the role and aspects of the goddess Maat,t therehave been only cursory comments concerning the ritual of the presentation of her image.2It is generally accepted that the ritual, as any other offering ritual, expresses the relationship of the kingto the gods.3 However, the offering of Maat very specifically commemorates the willingness of the king touphold the fundamental principles of world order (m?'t) that were established at the beginning of time. Theritual also functions as a symbol of the king's legitimacy.Several scholars have suggested that the presentation of Maat is a symbol of a supreme offering, or ofall other types of offerings subsumed in her tiny figure.4 Others have discussed a more specific purpose inthis ritual, suggesting that its depiction has a political propaganda value, presumably expressing to mankindthat the king ruled in accordance with divine law and with divine approval.5 This sense of the ritual actingas a sign of political and divine legitimacy is emphasized by the fact that, with few exceptions and unlikemost other types of ritual offerings, the donor of Maat is the reigning king or a figure of quasi-royal author-ity.6 In this context of the ritual seeking to establish a sense of legitimacy for the donor, Assmann (1970: 65)asserts that the restriction of the presentation of Maat to the king is a reflection of the pharaoh's superiorand sole ability to discern the true functions and value of Maat. He alone, as the divinely supported ruler,knows the values by which Egypt should be guided.1.

In Coffin Text Spell 1105, it is stated that \"I have nurtured Maat; prepare a path for me that Imight receive the wrrt-crown ... from her\" (CT VII, 432-33). Kagemni warns \"do Maat for the king (for)Maat is what the king loves ... speak Maat to the king, (for) Maat is what the king loves.\"7 The value andsymbols of Maat followed the king throughout his life. The Instructions for Merikare indicate that life itselfdepended upon Maat: \"Do Maat that you may endure upon earth.\"' Ramesside kings' prenomens, assumedat their accession to the throne, are with few exceptions compounded with the name Maat.9 Far before thefirst attestation of the presentation of Maat in the mid-Eighteenth Dynasty, the kings incorporated the god-dess' name into portions of their titulary.'0 At least one ruler of the Eighteenth Dynasty was crowned in theTemple of Maat, which once stood to the east of Pylon 5 at Karnak.\" Kuhlmann (1977: 94, n. 1) suggeststhat the base of the king's throne is the Maat hieroglyph.'2 Westendorf (1971: 143-46) proposes that theroof slabs of the causeways of the Old Kingdom funerary complexes were deliberately carved in the shapeof double Maat signs.'\" In certain scenes from New Kingdom tombs, the goddess Maat stands protectivelybehind the king while he is seated in his kiosk.'4 A late Ramesside or Saite statue that depicts the seatedgoddess wearing the royal uraeus is another indication of the association of royal power and Maat.'5Maat permeated ancient law and the administration of the state. As the Maxims of Ptahhotep relate:\"Maat (justice) is great and its appropriateness is lasting; it has not been disturbed since the time of himwho made it ... there is punishment for him who passes over its laws .\"' The association between lawand Maat is echoed by the Maat-form pendant that was worn by the vizier.\"7 Strudwick (1985: 178) sug-gests that another \"secular and administrative\" official also bore a Maat-related title, hm-ntr M 't.'8 Theloss of order, or what was perceived as lawlessness, was attributed to the loss of Maat, which is most appar-ent in the post-Amarna period when according to the Restoration Stela of Tutankhamun the king restoredMaat in the land that had been in confusion during the time of his predecessor.\"9 So, too, the scenes of theking slaying the assembled enemies of Egypt who appear on the face of pylons echo the association of theking and the proper order of the land. In such compositions, the defeated enemy holds a Maat feather as asign of submission.2 Such compositions could be related not only to the king's ability to rule the land cor-rectly, but also to his ability to restore order and to maintain the primordial order of the land that existed atthe beginning of time. The associations of Maat with the ancient Egyptian state and idea of kingship are sonumerous and pervasive that one could be tempted to conclude that during the pharaonic period \"l'6tat,c'est Maat.\"2'7. Urk. I, 195.6-8; Blumenthal (1970: 432-41) lists othersuch examples.8. So commented upon by Assmann (1984b: 695-96).9. With the following exceptions, all Ramesside kings haveMaat in their prenomen: Ramesses I and Merneptah haveMaat in the nomen rather than the prenomen; Amunmesseand Twosert have Maat in their Horus name rather thannomen. The last kings of the Nineteenth Dynasty (Seti 1and Siptaand Siptah) and the first of the Twentieth (Sethnakht) lackMaat in any part of their titulary. This characteristic isshared by Ramesses IX. Herihor compounded his GoldenHorus name with Maat in the epithetirt Mt.10. This occurs first in the nbty name (nb M?it) and Horusname (nb MIt Snfrw) of Snefru.

It is rather unlikely that this is a secular title, but ratherthat it is a title which denotes a priest of Maat who is in-volved in the judicial workings of the government. Due toMaat's intimate role in the legal structure of the land, or atleast in the formation of the traditions upon which the landwas ruled, it would not be unlikely that such a priestly titlewould be found in a more \"secular\" realm. Note also thewell-attested multiplicity of offices that were held by oneindividual. Strudwick (1985: 206-07) also mentions thatthe hm-ntr Mi't title is \"usually associated with legal offi-cials,\" which accords well with the many associations thatthe vizier had with Maat.19. Urk.

Bergman (1972: 83)considers the ritual to represent the king presenting aspects of the state, and thus literally upholding thelaws which the gods love. Hornung also comments upon the political implications of the ritual, citing it as aphysical symbol of the partnership between god and mankind. As the representative of mankind, the kingpresents Maat because \"... gods and people must together ensure that disorder does not come to overpowerjustice and order; this is the meaning of their common obligation toward maat\" (Homung 1982: 213).One of the features of the ritual that is most commonly commented upon is its expression of the do utdes relationship between the king and the gods.22 In this ritual, the king presents the image of the goddess,who represents law and righteousness, to the gods who have granted boons to the king.23 Although this rela-tionship is expressed in all types of offering rituals, the presentation of Maat, as the embodiment of the lawsand customs upon which the land is founded, is the most complete expression of the reciprocal god-king re-lationship because of Maat's association with royal duties and prerogatives.A feature of the presentation of Maat that has been less frequently noted is its association with the of-fering of the royal name.24 In what ways are the two rituals associated, and what is the origin of theRamesside name-offering ritual? Rdssler-Kdihler (1984: 941) points out that during the Amarna period thepresentation of Maat was replaced by representations of the king and queen in the guise of the offspring ofRe, elevating the name of the Aton. To what extent are these Amarna scenes the inspiration or direct prede-cessor of the Ramesside ritual of the presentation of the name?In the course of this work, an attempt is made to compare more systematically the iconography and in-scriptions of the presentation of the royal and divine name with the closely related scenes of the offering ofMaat, and to determine whether the offering of the royal Ramesside name is indeed derived from scenes ofthe presentation of the name of the Aton, or if it is a new iconographic feature of the Ramesside period.By far the most intriguing issue that pertains to the presentation of Maat, championed by Assmann andreferred to by others, relates to the proposed change in the nature of the man-god relationship in theRamesside period.2 5 Assmann (1983b: 283-86; 1984b: 687-701) suggests that the man-god relationship atthis time is directly related to a changing conception of the idea of Maat. These changes, which according toAssmann are rooted in the Amarna experience, are manifested by a growing dependence of mankind uponthe gods and the diminution of the king's role as an intermediary. This ensuing persdnliche Frimmigkeit(personal piety), characterized by mankind's sense of helplessness and total reliance upon god's will, aswell as the disassociation of act and reward, is according to Assmann due to the gradually diminished roleof Maat as an ethical concept.26 Assmann proposes that by the mid-Ramesside period, this sense of personalpiety had dramatic implications for funerary beliefs because an assurance of justification was no longerbased upon conducting one's life in accordance with the precepts of Maat or upon funerary endowmentsand furnishings. The fate of man came to depend entirely upon the whim and will of the gods,27 and the as-sured or \"automatic atonement\" of the earlier period was gone (Morenz 1973: 127-30). Assmann (1984b:699) suggests that this is also reflected in the iconography of tomb decoration, which during the Ramessideperiod emphasizes scenes of the gods and themes of immortality rather than biographical information.Assmann's assertions are based upon a fairly compact series of hymns from private tombs, personal let-ters, didactic literature, and a limited number of historical texts.28 His important discussion of Ramessideethics and religion has not taken into account an entirely different corpus of material, specifically the22.

With Assmann's far-reaching suggestions concerning the changing roleof the goddess and of the Ramesside king, one assumes that the scenes of the king presenting Maat are ofspecial relevance to his argument. One might question whether the incidence, iconography, and inscriptionsof the scenes of the presentation of Maat in any way support, or conflict with, Assmann's theoretical recon-struction of a change in the conception of Maat.The information for this study is derived primarily from reliefs that appear on New Kingdom and ThirdIntermediate Period temples. The relevance of the temple inscriptions and reliefs to a study of popular reli-gion cannot be overlooked because certain inscriptions and architectural features indicate that portions ofthe temples were indeed accessible to the general population.That the common man had access to the temples is best attested by the so-called \"Temples of the Hear-ing Ear,\" places of supplication and hearing petitions, which are found in association with the temples ofLuxor and Karnak.2 9 One such structure to the east of Karnak was begun by Hatshepsut or Thutmose III pos-sibly upon the foundations of a temple with a similar function dating from the time of Thutmose I (Nims1971: 111). In the time of Ramesses II, another shrine was constructed nearby by Bakenkhonsu, High Priestof Amun. The resident deity of this Temple of \"Amun-Re-Horakhty\" was alternately referred to as \"theplace where Ramesses hears Petitions\" (KRI 1II, 298.12) or as a place where the god Amun sdm nht \"hearspetition(s).\"30 Reliefs of Herihor in the court of the Temple of Khonsu depicting the southern chapel of theKarnak temple indicate that by the end of the Twentieth Dynasty the resident deities of the chapel wereAmun and Amunet along with the otherwise unknown \"Amunhotep of the Date Palm,\" and that the chapelwas called the 'n6 sdm m pr lmn \"the hearing ear in the Temple of Amun.\"' The structure continued to bea place of popular worship into the Ptolemaic period, when it was a place of petition to Amun. In the reignof Ptolemy VIII, the king again was the one to whom petitions were made.3 2The Amun chapel of the triple shrine of Seti II in the first court of the temple was referred to as a \"placeof obeisance, honoring, and praying to all the gods,\"\"3 and hence was a place of popular worship.The doorway of the chapel of Osiris Hekadjet at Karnak is decorated with a scene of Amunirdis pre-senting Maat. The doorway is named \"The great doorway ... of Amunirdis, whom the people adore in thehouse of her father Osiris, Ruler of Eternity\" (Nims 1955: 116, 123, no. 20), suggesting that the entrance ofthe small temple, with its scene of the presentation of Maat, was a place of popular gathering.The presence of non-priestly individuals within the Hypostyle Hall at Karnak and the relevance of thedecorated hall for a study of popular religion can be attested by architrave inscriptions that refer to the hallas \"a place where the common people (rtyt) praise the name of his majesty\" (KRI II, 559.7-8; Nims 1954:80). The hall was also referred to as the place \"in which Amun is manifest to the populace\" (Nims 1965:93). This ability of the common man to enter that area of the temple is also attested by the dw? rtiyt nb \"RN[of king] whom all the common folk praise.\"34Although the court located to the south of the Fifth and Sixth Pylons is not specifically called a place ofprayer, Barguet suggests that it was a place of procession and thus was an area of assembly. The north wallof this court is decorated with a scene of Ramesses III presenting Maat to an image of Amun (D3), whichwas originally covered with precious metal (Barguet 1962: 113-14, no. 6).The first court at Luxor Temple was also an area of public assembly and thus its decoration is relevantto popular religion.

The pillars onthe east side of the court are decorated with the dw? rbyt nb rebus, again attesting to the access that the pub-lic had into the area. Inscriptions in the Khonsu and Mut chapels in the triple shrine in the court indicate thatthese structures were also areas of popular worship.3 6 So, too, Mumane (1985a: 147-48) suggests that thefalse door and ram-headed standards in the Amun section of that structure are indications that common folkprayed within the chapel.Certain sections of the Medinet Habu complex were also employed by non-priestly worshippers. Thefigure of Ptah \"who hears petitions\" on the south wall of the passage through the High Gate at MedinetHabu attests to popular assembly and piety in that area of the temple complex.37 Like the image of Amun inthe Thutmoside court south of the Fifth and Sixth Pylons at the Temple of Amun, this image of Ptah atMedinet Habu might have been covered with precious overlay (Murane 1980: 7). A marginal inscriptionon the exterior west wall of the temple refers to st snmh sdm sprwt \"a place of supplication and hearingprayers\" (MH III, pl. 181A). Nims demonstrates that the \"Amun-Re in the Thickness of the Door\" leading tothe first court of the great temple was the focus of popular devotion, as has Fischer for the representations ofgods who are surrounded by peg holes from which coverings were hung near the entrance of the SecondCourt.3 8 The west and north walls of the Second Court also bear traces of peg holes around scenes of theTheban Triad, Ptah, and the shrines of the triad on their sacred barks,39 suggesting that this section of thetemple was, at least on occasion, accessible to the public. Fischer (1959: 198) argues that although the exte-rior doorways of the temple with their associated representation of the deity were the primary areas ofpopular petition, the west wall of the Second Court, which functioned as the portico for the inner areas ofthe temple, might have been the deepest area of the temple into which the non-priestly staff could enter.This judgment is based not only on the presence of peg holes that surround figures of certain gods on thewest wall of the Second Court,40 but also upon the fact that in four out of five examples of barks upon thenorth wall of the Second Court the shrines of the barks are veiled as they would be in public processions.41The Eighteenth Dynasty temple also served as a place for petitions and prayer into the Late period.42A reference to snmh sdm sprwt \"supplication and hearing petitions\" is found in the bandeau texts at thebase of the east wall of the first hall of the Ramesseum (KRI II, 653.4-5), indicating that common peoplewere allowed into that section of the temple.The reliefs of the Inner Hypostyle Hall of the Temple of Seti I at Abydos were also for public consump-tion as suggested by the use of the dw?. rthyt nb motif on the lower portion of the pillars of the hall (AbydosIV, pls. 5; 41B-C; 57). So, too, the First Octostyle Hall of the Temple of Ramesses II at Abydos is decoratednot only with the dw? rhyt nb rebus, but also with the dw? p't nb \"all mankind gives praise\" rebus.4 3This survey of public access to temples demonstrates the relevance of the monuments to a study of therelationship of man to his gods and to his king. The sources derived from the temples are complementary toAssmann's \"private\" documents and sources, because although composed from the \"official\" viewpoint,they were ultimately not only for the consumption of priests and the privileged, but also for the same groupof people who lived and built their tombs at Thebes. To overlook this vast body of material is to have an in-complete view of the religion of the common man. Since Assmann's reconstruction of Ramesside religionalso emphasizes a diminished role of the king and an accompanying closeness of man and god, one mightexpect that the temple reliefs, wherein the focus is on the king's relationship to the gods, should be includedin a test of any changes in theology in the Ramesside period.The following chapters document the basic features of the presentation of Maat, a ritual that has beenacknowledged to be so important yet has received little systematic study.

However, the first is now attributed to Merneptah,4 and the second to Amunmesse, usurped bySeti II.1 The attribution of an additional scene (B2) is less secure, considering that Amunhotep I is also hon-ored on the same monument.6There are no representations of the presentation of Maat that can be ascribed to the reign ofHatshepsut, although a textual reference can be cited from the base of a statue from Deir el-Bahari whichportrays the queen offering jars. The statue bears the inscription Hit-pswt-hnkt-M 't-n-'Imn \"Hatshepsut,who offers Maat to Amun.\"7 Another possible example, from the queen's chapel at Speos Artemidos doesnot employ the usual phraseology associated with the ritual presentation of Maat.8 These two texts suggestthat although there are no examples of the representation of the ritual from the reign of Hatshepsut, the pre-sentation of Maat was performed during her reign.No scenes of the ritual are known from the reign of Amunhotep II. However, Van Siclen (1985: 227;1986: 44, no. 6) suggests that the Amunhotep III's Temple of Maat in Karnak North is built of blocks reem-ployed from an Amunhotep II structure that might have been dedicated to Maat.The reign of Thutmose IV yields no examples of the representation of the ritual, although the SphinxStela refers to the ritual (Urk. IV, 1540.15), employing the same vocabulary as that which narrates some ofthe earlier depictions of the ritual itself (h.nk M 't n ...). The consistency of the vocabulary suggests that theritual continued as a theme for temple decoration in the time of Thutmose IV; although there are no ex-amples of the scene itself from that reign, its significance was undiminished.Maat received more emphasis in the reign of Amunhotep III, not only through representations of thegoddess and the presentation of her image, but also in the construction of the Temple of Maat in KarnakNorth (Varille 1943: 21-27). No scenes of the presentation of Maat from that Eighteenth Dynasty structureare known.1. In contrast to the statement of Anthes (1952: 13) that theritual is known only once before the Amarna period andDerchain's (1961: 66, no. 10) rather vague \"Les examplesde l'offrande de Maat sont ... attest6s depuis le NouveauEmpire ... .\"2.

The Cairo naos (C2), the Cairo stela (B3), and the scene on the Third Pylon atKarnak (Cl; Murnane 1979: 11-27) depict the king presenting Maat to Amun. A representation on one sideof a pedestal from el-Ashmunein portrays the king offering to an inscription of Thoth (A2). Three of theseexamples (A2, B3, Cl) are dated to the later years of his reign after the celebration of his first jubilee.9The relatively great number of unmutilated and unusurped reliefs that can be dated to Amunhotep IIIallows a more accurate evaluation of the incidence of the motif during his reign. Yet, even with the greatercorpus of material, it is evident that the presentation of Maat was not a standard or at least common motif intemple decoration at that time. The decorative scheme of the southern part of Luxor Temple, with its wealthof ritual scenes charged with symbolism of royal power and legitimacy (Bell 1985a: 251-94), does not in-clude a single depiction of the presentation of Maat. This omission creates some doubts about the assumedimportance of the ritual in the mid-Eighteenth Dynasty, or at least concerning its relevance to the theme ofkingship as expressed at Luxor Temple.Although representations of the presentation of Maat are not numerous in the time of Amunhotep IIIand before, textual references to the ritual, or at least to the idea of offering Maat, appear in private monu-ments from the time of Thutmose IV through the end of the dynasty (M5; R2, 4-6, 11-12). These texts, al-though not accompanied by a representation of the offering rite, indicate that the ritual was certainly knownto the Theban citizens who, in the course of their own devotions, visited the areas of the temples where thepresentation of Maat was displayed.'0 The stelophorous statue of Nefermenu (R2) and scenes from TT 38(Djeserkaresoneb; R4) and TT 66 (Hepw; R12), which mimic the standard phrase hnk(.i) M't employed inthe royal scenes,\" document this transfer of the theme to the non-royal context.Other non-royal attestations refer to the possession or transfer of Maat. In TT 102 (M5), Imhotep re-lates IL.n. tr.k 'wy.1 hr M 't fw M't hr db'w.1 \"I have come to you, my arms bearing Maat; Maat is uponmy fingers.\" In the tomb of Kheruef (TT 192; R6) an inscription refers to snm.k M 't lr hry.s \"you feed onMaat from the one (i.e., Kheruef) who bears it.\" '2 The sun hymn on the north reveal of the doorway of thetomb of Neferhotep (R11) contains many references to Maat and Re. In one passage the deceased avowsddk M.t bnt 1b.f s'r(.1) s(t) n k?.k \"It is in order that I elevate Maat to your ka that you give Maat to me.\" \"Means of transfer of this purely royal motif between the royal and non-royal spheres of experience in-clude not only the scenes that were visible to common folk in the temples, but also hymns and popular litur-gical literature. Another means through which the common folk were able to glean information about thepresentation of Maat is from the corpus of traditional funerary texts, such as the Coffin Texts, which includereferences to the transfer or elevation of Maat. Spell 647 (CT VI, 267) contains the passage \"I have liftedMaat up to the altar of Shu.\" Spell 723 (CT VI, 352) alludes to the presentation of Maat to Re: \"[PN] is thebutler of Re who will never die, Maat is raised up to him (i.e., Re).\" Spell 491 (CT VI, 70-71) suggests thatpresenting Maat to Re will provide for the soul of the deceased. Spells 16, 17, and 165 (CT I, 51; CT III, 6)elucidate the symbiotic relationship of Maat and Re because the goddess is referred to as an invocation of-fering and as the food of Re.THE AMARNA PERIODThe relief record of the talatat at Karnak indicates that the presentation of Maat was far more commonin the early Amarna period than in any other period of the Eighteenth Dynasty.4 Thirty examples are at-tested (e.g., Jl-10): twenty nine from the Karnak materials and an additional, non-talatat example fromAmarna (J1l).9.

The offering of Maat was certainly not, and never was, the most common or even among themore common offerings at Karnak.\"5 Secondly, the offering of Maat did continue at Amarna, attested byrepresentations (J11-12) and through textual references in private tombs at Amarna.'6 The texts in the tombof May and of Aye both preserve the phrase s.f inmk M0't n hr.k nfr ...\" \"His son (Akhenaton), who pre-sents Maat to your (Aton's) beautiful face.\" In both examples, M~'t is written , being perhaps a circum-locution for a ritual that was still held to be a royal prerogative.\" The verb hnk is characteristic of the dedi-cation inscriptions that narrate the presentation of Maat in non-Amarna era scenes.'9Several features distinguish the scenes from the time of Amunhotep IV and the Amarna period properfrom those of the earlier and later periods. The Amunhotep IV/Akhenaton presentation scenes are not nar-rated by dedication, and because the Aton is mute, there are no response inscriptions. The king is not thesole officiant (J6-9, 11),20 and an unusual proportion of the scenes are double compositions wherein thesame figure, be it the king or queen, is shown twice, the figures face to face beneath the rays of the Aton(J1, 3[?], 4-5, 7-8, 10).THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH DYNASTYThere are few examples of the presentation of Maat in the post-Amarna Eighteenth Dynasty. No scenesare known from the time of Smenkhkare. Five scenes can be dated to Tutankhamun: the bezel of a gold ringdepicting the king kneeling as he elevates an image of Maat as Nekhbet hovers overhead (C4); the decora-tions on the towboat which draws the Wsr-hit-barge in the reliefs in the southeast comer of the ColonnadeHall at Luxor Temple (C3); a double scene that adorns the representation of a temple doorway in the Opetreliefs at Luxor Temple (C6); and a stela (usurped by Horemheb) which depicts the presentation of Maat toAmun and Mut (C5).2' Another loose block at Karnak (B4) has been dated to either Tutankhamun or Aye.22The presentation of Maat in the reign of Tutankhamun is paralleled by the importance that the goddessis given in the text of that king's Restoration Stela (Urk. IV, 2026.18-19), wherein Tutankhamun boastsM 't mn.ti m st.s dlf wn grgw m bwt t, mi spf tpy \"Maat is established in her place; he (Tutankhamun) hascaused lies to be an abomination, the land being as (it was) in its primordial time.\" This general phraseol-ogy was copied by other rulers who followed periods of real or conceptualized political distress.2 3chives of both the Akhenaton Temple Project of the Uni-versity of Toronto (stored at Chicago House, Luxor) andthe Centre Franco-6gyptien d'ltudes des Temples deKarnak were examined. Twenty-nine examples of the pre-sentation of Maat among the 47,000 talatat photographswere recorded.15. Although other types of scenes were not systematically re-corded, the presentation of various vessels is the mostcommon type of offering, followed perhaps by censing.16.

Hari (1985: 13) notes \"The absolute refusal to allude toanything that recalls the traditional pantheon ... . The im-age of the goddess (Maat) had been replaced ... by pho-netic readings.\" However, the epithet 'nh m MIt is writtenU without avoidance of the divine determinative on a\"royal example\" from Akhetaton (Jl 1) and the inscriptionson the center and side bands of the coffin recovered fromTomb 55 (Davis 1910: 18) have 0. For examples of theavoidance of the divine determinative, see Gardiner1957b: 13. See Aldred 1988: 203 for additional commentsconcerning the coffin and its inscriptions.19. See further in Chapter 5.20. Working with largely unmatched talatat made it difficult todetermine precisely who was the officiant of the presenta-tion in the majority of the scenes. However, eight of thetwenty-nine Karnak talatat scenes clearly show the queenpresenting Maat. A single example from Amarna depictsthe queen as the officiant.21. Schaden 1985: 36. Otto Schaden kindly assisted in locatingscenes from the reign of Aye.22. Schaden 1988: 279-84. See Eaton-Krauss 1988: 8-9 forthe assertion that it is to be dated to the reign of Tutankh-amun.23. See the Edict of Horemheb (Urk. IV, 2141.16) and the textof High Priest Osorkon (LI). The idea of kingship and theestablishment of Maat might be echoed in the adoption,upon accession, of names that incorporate Maat. In theEighteenth through Twentieth Dynasties alone, the follow-ing rulers have prenomens, or Horus or Golden Horusnames, compounded with the name of the goddess:Thutmose I, Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Thutmose IV,Amunhotep III, Tutankhamun, Aye, Horemheb, RamessesI, Seti I, Ramesses II, Merneptah, Amunmesse, Twosert,Ramesses Ill-VIII, Ramesses X-XI.

The stela usurped fromTutankhamun (C5) is the single example of the representation from the reign of Horemheb. However, bothAye and Horemheb incorporated Maat into their titularies: Aye within his prenomen (fpr bprw R ir M 't,written without the seated female determinative) and Horemheb within his Golden Horus name (hr hr M3'tsbpr tiwy) and in a variant of his prenomen (Dsr bprw RI hk? MIt), both written with the seated goddessdeterminative (von Beckerath 1984: 87, 232). The Edict of Horemheb offered the king an opportunity toclaim that he was in fact united with the goddess of truth: M?'t i'y.t hnm.n.s im.f \"Maat (,4) has come andshe has united with him (Horemheb)\" (Urk. IV, 2141.16). Considering the devotion to the goddess Maat re-flected in the titularies of the last two pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty, it is possible that both rulers por-trayed themselves presenting Maat on other monuments which are now lost.THE RAMESSIDE PERIODSignificant changes in the depiction of the presentation of Maat occurred during the Ramesside period.The scene became a very common iconographic device, the prenomen of the king was associated with theritual, and features of the motif were usurped for use in non-royal tombs.The only example of the motif recorded for Ramesses I is a citation in Porter and Moss.24 There are nu-merous examples of Seti I presenting Maat.2 5 The motif was employed in the decoration of every majormonument of the king and several minor monuments in the Nile Valley, the deserts, and in Nubia.26The presentation of the royal prenomen equated with Maat appears first in the reign of Seti 127 and itcontinues to be employed through the reign of Shoshenq III (pl. 21, G5). The equivalence of the two offer-ings is made clear not only by their shared iconography, but more fundamentally by the dedication hnk MItn ... \"presenting Maat to ...\" which accompanies most of the scenes of the offering of the royal name. Thename is associated with Maat not by the dedication inscription, but rather by her prominence in the depictionof the presentation of a complex rebus of the king's name. This association of Maat with the royal name is anindication that the conception of Maat and the Maat presentation ritual had undergone a significant change,because pharaohs of the preceding dynasty who are otherwise known to have employed the Maat presenta-tion theme had prenomens (viz., Nb M?'t R' and M?'t k? R') that allowed for the composition of complex re-buses28 and could have been adapted to such ritual presentation. Yet, these Eighteenth Dynasty rulers did notpresent the rebus of their prenomen.29This equation of the presentation of Maat and the royal name indicates that the Ramesside kingswished to express the idea that their names, and thereby themselves, were an aspect of Maat. Although theidea of the king being united with Maat is attested before the Ramesside period,30 the presentation of the re-bus of the king's name equated with Maat appears first in the reign of Seti 1. It may not be coincidental thatSeti assumed another epithet, whm mswt \"Repeating of Births,\" a title that is attested in other periods when24. PM II, 39 (144) II.I.2: a king, possibly Ramesses I, is rep-resented offering Maat to Amun(?). The wall is so frag-mentary and so heavily repaired that the scene was notvisible.25. No effort is made in the Appendix: Classification of Scenesto list every one of the very numerous examples of the pre-sentation of Maat from the time of Seti I onward. With theexception of class J (Amarna), all of the known EighteenthDynasty examples are given.26. Specifically, the Hypostyle Hall at Karnak (A7); Templeof Seti I at Abydos (A3-4, BS); Kanais (Fl); LuxorTemple (B6); Temple of Ptah at Karnak (BS); his mortu-ary temple at Gourna (F2-3, 7); and the Popolo Obelisk(C8). The Nauri Decree (A6) is also illustrated with ascene of the presentation of Maat.27. Equated with Maat through the dedication: hnk Met n ...\"Presenting Maat to ... \" (FI-2, 5-8, 12-13, 20-22); andthe variants: rdit MIt ... \"giving Maat\" (FIO-I 1; pl. 24)and dl MIt (F19). As noted by R6ssler-K6hler (1984: 943,no. 71), the presentation of the nomen is rare (to her listadd H2-3, both Ramesses IV).28. For rebuses of Hatshepsut, see Drioton 1938: 237-40; ofAmunhotep III, see the block statue of Nebnefer in theLuxor Museum Journal, no. 136, pictured in Luxor Mu-seum 1979: 94-95.29. In the only known example of Amunhotep III presentinghis name, he offers the double cartouches poised upon arebus for \"millions of years of stability\" (4dd) (pl. 16). Incontrast to the Ramesside examples, there is no attempt tomake an abstract rebus of the hieroglyphic elements of thename in the Amunhotep III example.30. Edict of Horemheb: M?'t f.t hnm.n.s Imf \"Maat has comeafter she united with him (Horemheb)\" (Urk.

The pharaoh acting as agent for thedeceased appears first in the reign of Ramesses II (01-3) and can be interpreted as a circumlocution or asoftening of the transition of the movement of a purely royal theme into the non-royal sphere.3 4 The top reg-ister of the Mosi Stela in Hildesheim (01) shows Ramesses II presenting Maat to Ptah and rewarding Mosi,the owner of the stela. The lower register depicts Mosi and others receiving gifts from the pharaoh in thepresence of a statue of the deified Ramesses II (Habachi 1969, fig. 17). The three actions shown on thestela are all royal prerogatives, executed on behalf of Mosi. A similar scene on the Karo Stela (02) por-trays Ramesses II, followed by the vizier Paser, presenting Maat to Ptah. In the lower register, the deceasedgives praise to Ptah. So, too, another stela of Ramesses II presenting Maat depicts the vizier Paser standingdirectly behind the king rather than in a separate register (03). Additional examples can be cited fromGebel Silsila.3 5 In all of these examples, the king acts as an intermediary for the deceased. Because theritual presentation of Maat was a royal prerogative in this period, the deceased had to rely upon the king forthe execution of the ritual, yet the scene, which formerly appeared in the royal context alone, was trans-ferred to a non-royal context and use.6 This type of stela continued to be produced during the time ofMerneptah. Examples from that reign include a fragmentary stela from Deir el-Medina (04), which, similarto the stela of Karo, is dedicated to Ptah, \"Lord of Maat.\" Another stela, the Panhasy Stela (05), is dedi-cated to Amun-Re. Two later examples show Maat presented to Amun-Re (06, Ramesses IV) and to Ptah(07, Siamun).What appears to be a non-royal figure offering Maat first appears in four tombs constructed in the reignof Ramesses II and thus is roughly contemporary with the appearance of the stelae that show the king pre-senting Maat on behalf of the deceased. Two of the four tombs are at Deir el-Medina, the others in Gournaand Khokha. Varying degrees of the usurpation of the ritual can be discerned within this corpus of material.Two scenes, one from the tomb of Amunwahsu (pl. 1, MI) and the other from the Book of the Dead pa-pyrus of Sethnakht (pl. 2), depict the deceased holding a standing figure of Maat on their raised hand. Thisscene has royal precedents, the earliest being a similar scene of Seti I in the Osireion at Abydos (pl. 18, GI;Frankfort 1933, pl. 74). A feature that differentiates the royal from non-royal form of this scene is that in thenon-royal scenes the deceased simply carries the figure of the goddess on his palm,37 whereas in the royalscenes the god and the king are shown jointly supporting the image of the goddess. The royal scenes depictthe interaction of the god and the king who literally support Maat or the name in rebus or cartouche form.31. The epithet is also attested for Amunemhet I andHoremheb and for regnal years 19 onward of Ramesses XI(Murnane 1985b: 74-75, no. 50).32. Rossler-Kohler (1984: 943, no. 69) suggests that an iso-lated example of the presentation of the prenomen occursin the tomb of Shoshenq III at Tanis (pl. 21, G5 = Montet1960, pl. 30), which appears to be the presentation of thename as a simple rebus, not associated with Maat. Thisdifferentiation is distinguished by the form of the flat basethat in the Twentieth Dynasty is found under rebuses in theform of a jar or vase, which are not associated with Maat.Compare the Shoshenq example with rebuses of RamessesIV in the Ambulatory at the Temple of Khonsu (PM II, 237(47 II) = loc. KM 409b; PM II, 236 (40) 11.2 = loc. KM367), which are not associated with Maat.33. There are sixty-eight such scenes published in the MedinetHabu series (MH I-VIII).34. For general remarks concerning this \"democratization\" ofroyal prerogatives, see A. 1. Sadek 1987: 211, 229;Podemann 1989: 120-21.35.

The lower section of the stela that presumablyshowed the deceased praising Ptah is lost (Bruybre 1930:51, fig. 32).37. Another \"passive\" example can be cited in the texts fromthe tomb of Amunmesu (TT 373), in which the deceaseddeclares: ms.tw n.f Mt \"Maat is brought to him (Re).\"Here, the deceased is a passive bystander in the presenta-tion or transport of Maat.

The south wall of the burial chamber of Irynefer(pl. 3, M3) depicts the deceased, kneeling in front of his parents. All three figures face Ptah who is seatedon a throne. A figure of Maat, holding an tnb, sits on an offering table that is supported by Irynefer whosehands are cupped under the table in a pose of offering. The family of Irynefer is surrounded by inscriptionsgiving praises to Ptah and an invocation offering formula calling for thousands of provisions for the parentsof Irynefer.

I have broughtMaat so that you (Ptah) might rejoice over her! May you place me as one of these favored ones inthe land of M? ty . ..\"Here, the idea of the presentation of Maat is usurped from the royal model; however, certain strictly royalfeatures of the ritual have not been fully absorbed into its non-royal use. The offering inscription does nottake the form of the typical royal/divine dedication and response and the figure of Maat rests upon an offer-ing table, being a more passive offering than one actually proffered to the god by the donor. The inscriptionfrom the tomb of Irynefer, with its indication that Ptah and Maat have granted a good afterlife, and that theinvocation offerings are connected with Maat, are references to the funerary role of Maat. This scene, likethat in the tomb of Amunwahsu and those scenes which depict the king as an agent (class 0), could be aconspicuous effort to absorb the potency of certain royal rituals, without encroaching entirely upon royal re-spect and prerogatives.A more complete usurpation of some of the elements of the royal model occurs in the Deir el-Medinatomb of Amunnakht (pl. 4, M4). The east wall of the burial chamber shows the deceased and his wife be-fore Thoth. Amunnakht elevates a small figure of Maat seated on a nb-basket and holding an 'n, both fea-tures of the royal presentation scenes. The only feature of the iconography of this scene that sets it apartfrom those at, for example, the Temple of Amun is the form of the inscription (see Chapter 6: Significanceof the Ritual).38Several small bronze statues dating to the Ramesside period and later are in the form of priestly figureswho elevate Maat on a nb-sign (M5-6).3 9 Statues of the king (shown with uraeus) presenting Maat areknown from this period.40 It is possible that these bronzes represent the king in his priestly function ratherthan the statues being an attempt on the part of priests to commemorate themselves usurping royal privi-lege, which is seen in the Court of the Temple of Khonsu where Pinudjem I presents Maat to an offering in-scription that invokes Khonsu (B27). In contrast, every scene of \"king\" Herihor presenting Maat in theForeourt of the Temple of Khonsu (A28-33, E4) shows Herihor, as the donor of Maat, wearing a uraeus onhis priestly skullcap and his double cartouches are prominently displayed, symbolizing his dual rank of kingand his function of High Priest of Amun.4' From these representations one might conclude that the smallbronzes are votive figurines of priests acting on behalf of the king.42The scenes of Herihor presenting Maat are located in the Court of the Temple of Khonsu, the primaryarea where the high priest depicted himself as king (Khonsu I, xiv). These scenes complement our under-standing of his usurpation of the royal power; not only did he assume the fivefold titulary and in some casesthe royal headgear, but he engaged in royal rituals such as the Vasenlauf, Ruderlauf, and the presentationof Maat (ibid., xv-xvi).38. Another example of the non-royal presentation of Maat adjacent to CG 28/4/21/11 (= M6); see also Ziegler 1988:(TT 184 = M2) is questionable. The tomb was inaccessible 181-85.in 1985/86 and no photograph was available. Porter and 41.

Among the examples of ecclesiastical figures who present Maat in this period are High PriestOsorkon (Ll) and luwelot (L2); in both cases they are accompanied by the acknowledged ruler Takalot IIand Takalot I respectively. The depiction of the high priest engaged in a ritual normally reserved for theruler is in character with the events of both priests' careers and with their aspirations to full kingship.48This tendency of non-kingly, yet quasi-royal figures to present Maat is very pronounced among theranks of the God's Wives of Amun (class K). Each God's Wife, from Shepenwepet I to and includingAnkhnesneferibre, is portrayed presenting Maat.49 These scenes of the God's Wives are located in the smallchapels north of the Temple of Amun and in the tomb chapels at Medinet Habu.5o In these scenes, the God'sWife is depicted in the same scale as the god, indicating her exalted status.5 1The presentation of Maat scenes dated to Nitocris and Ankhnesneferibre (K8-10) differ slightly fromthose of their predecessors. In each of these examples, the God's Wife is accompanied by their \"majordomo,\" Pabasa and Shoshenq (rp't Ity-lsdwty bity smr w-t ... and tmy-r pr wr n dwt ntr respectively).The depiction of these government administrators might have been included as a method of bolstering theGod's Wives' power beyond their ecclesiastical foundation.52 The earlier scenes (KI-7) show the womenacting as the sole officiant before the god.The Third Intermediate Period yields two examples of a person of non-royal status presenting Maat to adeity. In the first example, on a stela in the British Museum, the priest Harsiese, presents a figure of thegoddess on a nb-base to Re-Horakhty (pl. 5, M8). The stela displays the usurpation of many of the elementsof the royal ritual, including the overall iconography (donor/recipient) and the form of the Maat offering,and lacks the characteristic dedication and response of the royal examples; as with the non-royal examplesfrom the Ramesside period, the stela of Harsiese is funerary in nature, which is emphasized by the garb ofthe priest who wears the panther skin of the lunmutef priest and also by the inscriptions that refer to thepriest as m?'-1rw and as \"the Osiris.\"5 3The second example, dating from the reign of Shoshenq III, appears on the front surface of a block stateof Nespekashuty from the Karnak Cachette, now in the Luxor Museum (M9).5 4The front surface of the43.

Therare examples of the usurpation of aspects of the representation itself (class M) for non-royal use date tothe Ramesside and the Late periods5 5 and are from the funerary rather than a temple context.The oldest surviving scene of the presentation of Maat dates to the midyears of the reign of ThutmoseIII. However, other innovations in religious iconography in the time of Hatshepsut/Thutmose III suggest thatthe presentation of Maat was one of the \"new\" depictions of cultic scenes which themselves were rooted inantiquity. Among these new features are the depiction of the divine royal birth,56 the cult of tree-goddessesand their representation,\" the depiction of the Opet Festival,58 the canonical lists of the Nine Bows,5 9 andthe emphasis upon Mut in the Theban Triad.' Some of these features are possibly true innovations (treegoddesses) and others (Opet scenes, divine birth, the presentation of Maat) could merely be the first con-crete representation of a traditional ritual.6' There was a desire to enrich the religious iconography duringthe reign of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, perhaps fueled by a wish to stress proof of legitimacy in the wakeof the irregularities of the royal succession.62 The presentation of Maat, a ritual alluded to in texts from theMiddle Kingdom,63 was just one of the motifs that became a part of the religious iconography of the period.As reflected by the extant monuments, the representation of the presentation of Maat was, with the ex-ception of the early Amarna period, not a common religious motif until the Ramesside period and it wasnever a common theme in royal or non-royal funerary monuments.The scenes from the early Amarna period provide a striking contrast to those from the pre- and post-Amarna Eighteenth Dynasty. Only four examples can be cited from the many monuments of Amunhotep III(A2, B3, Cl-2); thirty examples, and perhaps more,64 are known from the reign of Amunhotep IV/Akhenaton. This increased incidence could be ascribed to renewed emphasis upon the primacy of the solarcult, especially in the early years of the Amarna interlude. The role of Maat as the food of Re made her aspecially suitable offering to the new preeminent solar disk.65 She served as a bridge between the old andnew theologies; as the daughter of the traditional solar deity Re, she was offered up to the newly empha-sized Aton.Further, the proportion of talatat which depict Nefertiti presenting Maat (over half of the identifiablescenes show the queen) underscores the important role that Nefertiti played in the cult of the Aton.'

The textual references to the presentation of Maat that occur in private tombsfrom the Eighteenth Dynasty are related to the role of Maat in her association with Re. Nefermenu's texts(R2) appear on a stelophorous statue inscribed, as is usual, with a hymn to Re. Those of Djeserkaresoneb(R4) and Imhotep (M5) appear in the tombs' doorway hymns to the sun god. Further, all three of these ex-amples associate the presentation of Maat with the wdit-eye,68 rituals which Hornung (1992: 142) suggestsare linked by their symbolic allusion to \"a constantly endangered order that must repeatedly be establishedanew.\" In such a scene from the tomb of Imhotep, the link between the two rituals is graphically illustrated.There, the deceased holds the w_dt in one hand and the feather of Maat in the other, alluding to the parallelpresentation of the eye and Maat. The placement of these scenes within hymns to the sun makes it clearthat Maat appears as an aspect of her father Re and that she is rejuvenated with the rise or rebirth of the suneach day.The text from the tomb of Kheruef (R6) appears within the hymn to the sun. The text of Khaemhet (R5)is inscribed on a stelophorous statue and likewise is connected with the adoration of Re. These two ex-amples focus on Maat's aspect as the sustenance of Re (CT III, 6). Kheruef's \"you (Re) feed on Maat fromthe one who brings it\" is more specific regarding the consumption of Maat than Khaemhet's \"I have broughtMaat to you (Re) that you may live by means of it.\" However, the last example clearly links Re's existenceto Maat. This theme is elaborated upon in the sun hymn in the tomb of Neferhotep, in which the rising, set-ting, and powers of Re are associated with Maat.69 All of these non-royal examples, as Westendorf (1966:201 ff., esp. p. 209) points out, allude to the partnership of Maat and Re, specifically to the role that Maat,as the personification of cosmic order, played in the maintenance of the solar cycle.This theme is elaborated upon in the allusions to Maat in the sun hymns of many private tombs in theRamesside period.70 However, references to elevation and possession in a non-royal context were, through-out the pharaonic period, consciously differentiated from the royal model through the omission of the char-acteristic inscription and modification of the iconography. Even the occurrences that mimic the royalphraseology of hnk M3't1 ... (R2-3) or in.n(.t) n.k M.?t ... (R5, 7) are textual references alone. They do notinfringe upon the royal monopoly on the representation of the ritual.The presentation of Maat became a common element in the royal iconography of the Ramesside pe-riod. The ritual was used as a decorative theme in virtually all of the Ramesside temples and in eight royal67.

From the reign of Seti I to the end of the Ramesside period, the presentation of Maat was fused withthe presentation of the royal name.In this era, other formerly royal texts and the representations themselves were adopted for use in pri-vate tombs,7 yet there are only six (possibly seven) representations of the presentation of Maat in the non-royal context (pls. 1, 3-4; M1, 3-5, 7-9).7 The relatively small number of representations which show aprivate person holding Maat suggests that the theme was considered to be inappropriate for use in privatetombs and thus was not subjected to the same level of borrowing as other religious texts and representa-tions.Of the non-royal scenes, none shares all of the elements of the royal model. The composition of thescenes from the tomb of Amunwahsu (pl. 1, MI) and the papyrus of Sethnakht (pl. 2) is completely differ-ent from the royal temple examples. In the private scenes, the deceased appears to carry Maat rather thanpresent her image to the god(s). The scene in the burial chamber of Irynefer (pl. 3, M3) shows the deceasedin a passive rather than active stance and, similar to the other non-royal examples, lacks the characteristicdedication and response. The vignette from the tomb of Imhotep (M5) is a reference to the association ofthe wdt and Maat, rather than to the presentation of Maat.Although the relief of Amunnakht (pl. 4, M4) does incorporate many of the features of the standardroyal iconography (Maat seated on nb, holding an Inb), it lacks an inscription that fully validates the divine-royal relationship symbolized by the royal scenes and is clearly funerary in nature. The scene is flanked byvignettes of Anubis and the funerary banquet and Thoth rewarding the deceased with life. The symbolismof presenting Maat in this context is a conflation of the illustration for BD chapter 125 with the presentationof Maat. In this example, rather than weighing the heart of the deceased against Maat in anticipation ofThoth inscribing the verdict, the deceased presents Maat in exchange for renewed life, represented by the4n -scepter, topped with an 'nb-sign that Thoth holds to Amunnakht's nose. The symbol of the seated god-dess also serves as a substitute for the text of the Negative Confession. This scene, although related in ico-nography to the royal scenes, is of an entirely different and funerary nature.Although these examples could initially be recognized as usurpations of a royal prerogative, none ofthese vignettes shares the full iconography and the intent of the royal motif. The non-royal scenes arefunerary in nature, vignettes related to BD chapter 125, whereas the royal scenes are rooted primarily in asense of royal legitimacy and the reciprocal nature of semi-divine rule.Coffin Text Spells 452 (CT V, 321c-d) and 959 (CT VII, 178) which relate Re's role as scribe or as thebalance at the judgment of the dead, link the symbolism of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasty non-royal scenes. The shared element is the funerary nature of the scenes expressed in the earlier texts throughthe adoration of the rising or setting sun, and the later examples in their funerary iconography and texts.Both genres are deeply rooted in the symbolism of Re and Maat in their funerary aspects.7\"The depiction of the Ramesside king presenting Maat on behalf of the deceased (01-7) functions ontwo levels of understanding. On one level, the deceased was made a privileged party to witness and indi-rectly partake of the potency of the pact between king and god and incidentally to proclaim for eternity thathis king did indeed uphold the tenets of Maat. He had, after a fashion \"seen\" or experienced this agree-ment; it is proclaimed alongside events such as rewards from the king that we can presume were historicallybased. This confidence in the king, and its commemoration upon the stela, provides a thoroughly non-mod-emr link between theology and political reality. Another aspect of the idea of the king as agent is its associa-tion with the htp di nsw formula (Radwan 1969: 106; Myfliwiec 1985: 11). The king is shown making an of-fering on behalf of the deceased in \"order to gain the god's favor for him\" (ibid., p. 11). Here, apparently,the \"favor\" is the king's maintenance of the cosmic order, the successful execution of which was consideredto be essential to every facet of the deceased's life and afterlife. The association of the tp di nsw withthese scenes makes the function of these stelae more understandable in their funerary context.71. For Amduat in private tombs, see Wente 1982: 161 ff.; A. 73. The scenes are also related through the solar aspects ofF. Sadek 1985: 326. The Book of Gates appears in TT 23 the judgment scenes because Re is associated with the(TIy).

The two High Priests of Amun (Osorkon and Takalot), theGod's Wives of Amun, and the Napatan kings all share the characteristic of attempting to legitimize theirpolitical ends through theological means. Each of them, as members of the royal family, acted as virtualruler in the Thebaid where their presentation of Maat scenes are found; yet they were not the acknowl-edged rulers of all Egypt.This association of the presentation of Maat with a desire to legitimate marginal right to rule is clearlyseen in the Donation Stela of Iuwelot (L2). On that document, the donor of Maat, Iuwelot, usurps the royalritual of the presentation of Maat in the same sense of independence as he dated the Nile levels at Thebesin his own name, rather than in the name of his brother, Pharaoh Takalot I. Both acts attest to Iuwelot's self-assumed sense of authority in Thebes (Kitchen 1973: 311). The relief on the Bubastite Portal (LI) portraysHigh Priest Osorkon presenting Maat to Amun in the presence of Takalot II. The text below the vignettehonors Osorkon's actions in subduing the Theban revolt (11. 31-34), punishing the rebels (1l. 35-36), and re-storing order in the southern city. Performing the functions of pharaoh himself, Osorkon boasts of beingsuckled by a goddess (1. 25) and later he issues decrees, on which Caminos (1958: 176) comments:The issuing of such high decrees on the sole authority of the high priest appears to be unattestedelsewhere. Perhaps Osorkon did exceed, by issuing them, the rights of his office, even if his action,as indeed he declared, was motivated by his desire to further the interests of the king.Osorkon's aspirations to the kingship of Egypt were demonstrated not only by his actions in the Thebanrevolts and in the phraseology of the tale of his military successes, but foremost in the representation of himpresenting Maat that accompanies the tale of his deeds. It served as a vivid graphic reminder of his abilityto rule and restore order (m't) to the land.The presumption of independent rule assumed by the God's Wives, especially Amunirdis I andShepenwepet II, is well attested.74 The presentation of Maat on the part of these women is another graphicindication of their assumption of royal power; only in the last years of the Nubian domination did the God'sWives represent themselves presenting Maat in the company, and support, of another administrator (K8-10; Leclant 1965: 384-85). In contrast to these actions, the highly influential Prophets of Amun at Thebes,particularly Montuemhet, from whose era many monuments are preserved, did not represent themselves intext or figure offering Maat, which is a reflection, perhaps, of their recognition of their own distance fromthe ruling house's bloodline.The scenes of the Nubian kings Shebitku, Taharka, Tanwetamani, and Aspelta presenting Maat to thegods are another example of their assumption of the traditional trappings of the Egyptian kingship(Russmann 1974: 24-26). Scenes of the presentation of Maat are attested for four Napatan kings, a highproportion considering the few monuments left by rulers of the line (ibid., pp. 11-24).In summary, the presentation of Maat was exclusively a royal ritual that was based, above all, upon theidea of royal legitimacy received from the gods. The aberrant occurrences (God's Wives, High Priests)were executed in the attempt to proclaim royal authority. Inscriptions of non-royal individuals of the Eigh-teenth Dynasty that refer to the presentation of Maat are related to the adoration of Re rather than a directassociation with Maat. The Ramesside vignettes that depict the deceased elevating the goddess usurp ele-ments of royal iconography; however, the resulting scenes serve a different function because they are en-tirely funerary in nature and are thus unrelated to the royal presentation of Maat.74. Leclant 1965: 374-86 (see p. 378 for specific reference to 177) asserts \"the God's Wife of Amun never aspired tothe presentation of Maat as a reflection of their assump- real pharaonic powers in the 23rd-26th Dynasties\" andtion of royal power). However, despite the trapping and Leclant (1965: 383) comments that the God's Wives didevidence of the heb-sed of Amunirdis II, Kitchen (1973: not date the Nile flood levels in their own name.17oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3ICONOGRAPHYGENERAL DESCRIPTIONScenes of the presentation of Maat are composed of the donor, the Maat symbol that is offered, and thedivine recipient.' In more elaborate scenes one or two attendant deities stand behind the recipient or onestands behind the donor (pl. 7). The donor and recipient face each other, flanking the Maat figurine thatcomprises the offering. The orientation of the goddess agrees with that of the donor; that is, they both facethe recipient.2 There is no significant difference in the iconography of the offering of Maat and the presen-tation of the Ramesside prenomen with the exception of the hand gestures of Ramesses IV.3 The scene maybe one of a series of scenes that is shown with or without marginal inscriptions to break the sequence. Withthe few exceptions listed in the following paragraphs, the donor of Maat is the king or a figure of \"quasi-royal\" status,5 who appears in anthropomorphic form.THE DONORSCENES WITH ANOMALOUS DONORSROYAL DONORS: ANOMALOUS ICONOGRAPHYAs noted, with few exceptions the donor of Maat is the king or a person of quasi-royal status portrayedin anthropomorphic form. In one exceptional scene from the tomb of Shoshenq III at Tanis, the king's Horusname acts as the donor (pl. 17, B29).6 Another unusual scene appears on a block at Tanis. There, RamessesII in the form of a sphinx is portrayed presenting Maat (pl. 14).7 A similar scene of Ramesses II in the formof a sphinx presenting Maat to Amun-Re appears over a doorway in the Great Temple at Abu Simbel (PMVII, 109 (96)).In other scenes, the iconography of the king is conventional, yet the action portrayed in the scene is not.Such a composition appears in the Osireion (pl. 18, GIl) and close parallels are found in the tombs ofRamesses VI (pl. 19, G4), Ramesses IX (pl. 20, 11), and Shoshenq III (pl. 21, G5). In the monument of SetiI (pl. 18), the king faces Horus and each figure extends a hand in order to support a flat base upon whichMaat stands.' This differs from the traditional iconography in several ways. Not only does the Maat figurestand on a flat base rather than sit on a nb-sign, but the figure also faces the king rather than the god. Theorientation of Maat suggests that Horus is presenting the goddess to the king. However, in a scene from thetomb of Ramesses VI (pl. 19, G4), which forms a very close parallel, the goddess, standing on a similar flatbase, faces the god, suggesting that in this scene the god rather than the king is the recipient.1.

The orientationof the hieroglyphic elements of the name give no indication which figure is the donor or the recipient, orwhether the name is being supported rather than presented from one party to another.Although the example from the tomb of Ramesses IX (pl. 20, II) predates the example from the tombof Shoshenq III at Tanis, it is a more elaborate example of the scene in the Tanite tomb. In the earlier tomb,two figures jointly hold the double cartouches of the king. A figure of Maat stands between the two car-touches, facing left. The figure to the left wears the double crown; the figure to the right wears a nemes withuraeus. Since there is no differentiation in the status of the two figures or any textual information as to theiridentity, one might assume that the figures are two aspects of the king rather than the king and a deity. Aswith the Shoshenq example (pl. 21), there is no indication that the name is being presented rather than be-ing physically upheld. Although the standing figure of Maat faces the left hand figure, that is perhaps notenough evidence to suggest that the figure to the right acts as the donor, passing the name to the figure onthe left.This examination of the scenes from the Osireion and the tombs of Ramesses VI, Ramesses IX, andShoshenq (pls. 18-21) suggests that they are not to be classified as scenes of the presentation of Maat orthe name because there is no clear differentiation of donor and recipient, no offering inscription that identi-fies the scenes as the presentation of Maat or the royal name, and no indication that the name or the imageof the goddess is being given from one party to another. Rather they are illusions to the association of Maatand the name. They are symbolic of the acclamation of the king's name by the gods and the rebirth of thename and kingt' and their identification with Re, which is suggested by the fact that in all four vignettes thecomposition appears as a double scene composed of two solar boats.\" The scene to the left contains theMaat or name vignette; the scene to the right depicts the king in the company of a female attendant whilebeing introduced to Atum in the presence of the \"gods who are in the company of Re in heaven.\"'2DIVINE DONORSAlthough scenes that represent a god serving as the donor of Maat are rare, there are numerous literaryreferences to such an act. These references range from the rare use of the verb ihnk (N8, Ql)13 in this con-text to more generalized references to Maat being upon the arms of the god or the god bearing Maat.\"4 Withfew exceptions,'5 the god upon whose arms Maat lies or who presents or elevates the goddess is Thoth (NI-3, 5-6, 9-11). This association of Maat and Thoth is well attested in the vignettes of Chapters 125 and 126of the Book of the Dead, from their association in the bark of the sun god, and from other contexts.'6Several scenes depict a god offering Maat.17 The first such scene appears on the facade of the tomb ofSetau at el-Kab (NI2). There, a baboon-headed figure elevates Maat seated upon her nb-platform to thesun disk. This scene is a reference to Thoth's presentation of Maat at the rising of the sun (symbolized bythe disk of Khepri) as related in Chapter 126 of the Book of the Dead.8This association is made more clear9.10.For other such rebus writings, see Teeter 1986b: 175-84.For the association of the king and his name, see Frandsen1989: 100-01.I1.

This platform also appears in scenes where the gods present the royal name or jubilees to the king.26The donor holds Maat, or the name equated with Maat, in one outstretched hand.27 According to aPtolemaic period offering inscription at the Temple of Khonsu, the hand that does not hold the image ofMaat is raised in protection of the goddess.28 This posture is comparatively unusual in Egyptian offeringscenes that usually show the king offering with both hands.29 This single hand offering stance, however, ischaracteristic not only of the offering of Maat, but also of the royal name, white bread,30 clepsydra,3 oint-ment,32 and more rarely, incense,33 and libations.34 The vast majority of single arm offering scenes, be theyMaat, the name, or other items, show a far arm dominance (in the perspective of the viewer), regardless ofthe orientation of the scene. When the donor faces left he offers with his right hand, and when facing righthe offers with his left hand. In such scenes, the donor's near arm is slightly extended and bent at the elbowand the palm is held upward and exposed to the recipient as he presents the offering in his far hand. In mostexamples, the palm saluting the recipient is behind the hand which holds the offering.35The reason for this far arm dominance does not seem to be ritual, but rather a practical necessity of theartistic composition of the offering scenes. The far arm's extension beyond the near arm ensures that the ob-ject being presented by the far arm is more easily visible, and that the near armn and its actions are not ob-scured, which is noticeable also in the two arm offerings that also show the far arm in front of the neararm.3624. The donor does not assume a humble posture (bending for-ward) such as he or she takes in other types of scenes (cf.RIK IV, pl. 77).25. See, for example, the columns in the Second Court atMedinet HIabu on which the uppermost of three scenes uni-formly portrays the kneeling king, the two lower scenesportray the king standing (MH V, pls. 260-71). A similarsituation is seen in the decoration of the west wall (northhalf) of the Htypostyle Hall at Karnak, where the lowestregister shows the king kneeling (OIP 106, pl. 262), andthe east wall (north half) where the king kneels before thegod in the daily offering service (ibid., pl. 264), with theexception of the rituals that involve the opening and clos-ing of the shrine. See also the posture of the recipient onthe south side of the Enclosure Wall at Karnak. where inthe upper register the recipient is seated, and in the lowerregister the deity stands (Helck 1968, pls. 39-53). AtAbydos, in a series of four registers, the donor stands inthe upper three and is seated in the lowest (Abyvdos IV, pl.24), which is due to the correspondence of the lowest reg-ister to adjacent scenes that show seated deities who in-scribe years and adore the king.26. MH V, pls. 291, 316; MH VII, pl. 498. However, the hb-base is not an invariable part of such compositions (seeOIP 106, pls. 52, 70, 79).27. Bergman (1968: 207) states that the king holds Maat inboth hands. This double-hand offering is known from liter-ary illusions to the ritual (NI, 5-6. 8) but is unknown in re-lief representations. So, too, statues generally show asingle-hand offering stance (cf. Ziegler 1988: 182, fig. 1).The name, presented in the form of an ornate jar or statue,can be held in both hands (PM II, 237 (47) b = loc. KM409b), although there is no direct association between therebus and Maat.28. \"I give you Ma\"'at in my left hand, my right arm protectingher ...\" (Parker and Lesko 1988: 171).29. See Osing 1977: 15, n. 46, for the assertion that this pose isrelated exclusively to the presentation of Maat and towhite bread. On the basis of his conclusion and the se-quence of the scenes, Osing reconstructs his scene 1.1 asthe presentation of Maat. This reconstruction is question-able considering the variety of offerings that are actuallyoffered with one hand.30. MH V, pis. 274C, 278A, 28 IC; Osing 1977, pis. 21, 30.31.

Note that the presentation of ointment could involve a dif-ferent hand gesture. The near hand (i.e., the one not hold-ing the offering) is normally held in a curious \"finger sa-lute\" wherein only the index and little fingers are ex-tended, presumably since they have been dipped into theointment (MH V, pls. 265B, 2698, 276E; MH VI, pl. 434F;MH VII, pl. 570B; Helck 1968, pls. 25, 72 [with salute];Khonsu II, pl. 129A [Ptolemy IVI). Contrast these scenesto Khonsu I, pl. 27A, in which ointment is offered with bothhands. For the salute, see Wainwright 1961: 492-93.33.

The scenes from the time of Ramesses IV at the Temple ofKhonsu do not always follow this form, and in many ex-amples the salute is held before the offering; see PM II,236 (40) 1.4 = loc. KM 361), presenting ointment; in PMII, 239 (73) = loc. KM 365 and 236 (40) II.5 = loc. KM370 = F16, Ramesses IV presents his name. See alsoHelck 1968, pl. 78, and further comments about this scene,below. Note also the different hand position of RamessesIII in a scene of the presentation of Maat that was alteredto show the presentation of wine (MH VI, pl. 442A). Herethe angle of the wrist differs slightly from that which is as-sociated with the presentation of Maat.36. For example, Helck 1968, pls. 47-48, 50-I51, 66-68, 70,73. Two of these scenes (pl. 67, presenting a necklace; pl.68, flowers) display an amusing feature of the far arm22oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"ICONOGRAPHYThere are a few examples in which the far arm is not dominant. One such example is encountered in ascene of Ramesses II on the east surface of the Enclosure Wall at Karnak, north of the door (Helck 1968, pl.78). In that scene, the offering is held in the near arm, yet, similar to the standard scenes, the far arm is ex-tended beyond the near arm. Another example on the east face of the Enclosure Wall portrays the kingpouring a libation to Amun, holding the vessel in his near hand (ibid., pl. 69). The reversal of the near andfar arm here might stem from the cramped composition of the scene. It is only by extending the near armacross the width of the king's body that the libation could be centered over the offering table.3 Other ex-amples of near arm offering include a scene in the tomb of Seti II and in the tomb of Ramesses III in whicheach king offers with his near (left) hand.3 8Scenes of Ramesses IV reflect a different pattern. With only one exception,39 when Ramesses IV isshown presenting Maat, his prenomen, or complex jars that incorporate a rebus of his name, he is shown of-fering with his near arm when facing left and with his far arm when facing right.40 In the single arm offer-ings, however, Ramesses IV with few exceptions uses his left hand.41 This unusual consistency creates astrange lack of symmetry on lintels where the near and far arms respectively present the offering (pl. 7).42This pattern is in striking contrast to the iconography of the other Ramesside kings.HEADGEARA variety of crowns is associated with the presentation of Maat; however, the blue (khepresh) crownoccurs far more frequently than any other. At Medinet Habu, of the sixty-one examples of the presentationof Maat or the royal name in which the crown is preserved,43 twenty-five scenes (40%) portray the bluecrown. In the Ambulatory of the Temple of Khonsu, Ramesses IV wears the blue crown in conjunction withthe presentation of his name in slightly less than 50% of the examples.44 The same figure can be cited forthe occurrence of the blue crown in the presentation of Maat scenes at the Gourna Temple of Seti 145 and onthe Enclosure Wall at Karnak (Helck 1968, pls. 22, 71).Two specific scenes emphasize the association of the blue crown with the presentation of Maat. Thefirst, on the portico of the Temple of Seti I at Gourna (B 11), shows the deceased Seti with his son,Ramesses II, who presents Maat to Re-Horakhty. As the active partner in the ritual, Ramesses wears theblue crown. The passive Seti wears the nemes headdress.46 This close association of the blue crown with theperformance of the ritual is also evidenced by a recut scene in the first hall of the tomb of Twosert (P3).There, the motif of the queen, who wears a double-plumed crown while presenting nw-vessels, was re-placed by Sethnakht's figure, wearing the blue crown and presenting Maat. Apparently the blue crown wasconsidered to be the more appropriate headgear for the ritual.47dominance. The depiction of the object being presented iscompromised by the need to have the far arm in front ofthe near arm. In both these scenes the offering is oddly in-tertwined in and behind the far arm.

In a study of the crownsthat the king wears while offering wine, Poo (1984: 52-53) suggests that there is no association between the offer-ing and the crown: \"the headdresses of the king ... are de-termined by the decorative scheme, rather than any par-ticular relationship between the offering and the crowns.\"23oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"THE PRESENTATION OF MAAT: RITUAL AND LEGITIMACY IN ANCIENT EGYPTAmong the other crowns that are shown in significant numbers in the Maat presentation scenes are thenemes48 and atef.4 9 In the Ambulatory at the Temple of Khonsu, the nemes neatly alternates with the bluecrown in the presentation of the royal name scenes.5 0 On the Enclosure Wall at Karnak, the atef and theblue crown are the only types of headgear to appear in conjunction with the presentation of Maat.5There are relatively few examples of the regional crowns (red2 or white5) in the scenes of the presen-tation of Maat; however, when the crowns appear, they do so most often in balanced pairs,5 4 which empha-sizes that the ritual stressed the overall world view of a united Egypt. The best illustration of this appears onthe portal of the First Pylon of the Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu, which is decorated with a se-ries of scenes, including two symmetrically opposed scenes of the presentation of Maat.\" These scenesshow the king in the red and white crown respectively. This pattern of balancing the red and white crown isrepeated in the scenes of the Ruderlauf and Vasenlauf, which appear at the top center of the doorway. Thefour other double scenes (libating, presenting wine, ointment, and being escorted into the presence of thegods) that make up the door's decorative scheme show the king crowned with the nemes or blue crown.Here, the rituals associated with the heb sed and with the presentation of Maat, both of which are chargedwith symbolism of effective rule, are given special emphasis through their association with the regionalcrowns that appear not singly but in pairs to stress the importance of the particular action to all of Egypt.\"6The crowns of the Amarna period do not show significant deviation from those associated with the pre-sentation of Maat from other periods. The Amarna period talatat from Thebes preserve six examples of theritual in which the king's headgear is preserved. Of these six scenes, four show the blue crown (Jl-2, 4-5),one the white crown (J3), and one the red crown with streamers (Jl0).57 Considering the preference fordouble compositions on the talatat, it is very probable that the scenes of red and white crowns would haveappeared in a balanced composition.5\" A seal from Amama shows the king wearing a three-feathered crown(Jl2) as he presents Maat.59 Scenes of Nefertiti presenting Maat also show a diversity in her crowns. Thetalatat record two examples of the Hathor crown (J6-7) and single examples of the layered wig (JS) andthe soft wig (J9).\" An example excavated at Amarna (JI 1) portrays the queen in the layered wig.6'48.

C6 (Tutankhamun in the Colonnade Hall of LuxorTemple) is an exception to this balancing of regionalcrowns, in which a doorframe is shown with scenes of thepresentation of Maat in the upper register to the left andright. Although the right scene is damaged, the symmetryof the crowns worn by the king on the scenes forming theleft-right pairs of scenes on the frame suggests that the up-per right scene, similar to the upper left, shows the kingwearing the red crown. The king wears the white crown inthe register below the scenes of the presentation of Maat.55. MH IV, pl. 244H (white), M (red).56. For a similar scene of Ptolemy II in the Temple of Khonsu,see Khonsu II, pl. I15A-B; MH VII, pl. 547, which al-though damaged, could also show the red crown in paral-lelism with the white.

There are not enough examples of the presentation ofMaat on the talatat to match such scenes; however, it isconceivable that 3 and J10 could form elements of suchdual compositions.

However, Amunirdis is seen elsewhere offer-ing Maat with the vulture headdress (K3). The crown of Ankhnesneferibre is further adorned with a solardisk and lyre horns (K8-9).The examples of Herihor and Pinudjem I, High Priests of Amun, offering Maat or a royal name63 uni-formly depict them wearing the close-fitting skullcap' rather than the blue crown that is so closely associ-ated with the ritual. This skullcap is normally worn by the king when his role as high priest is emphasized.65This depiction of an officiant wearing headgear that is not necessarily royal while performing rituals usuallyrestricted to the king is known from other scenes of Herihor in the Court at the Temple of Khonsu, in par-ticular the scenes of the high priest performing the Ruderlauf and Vasenlauf while wearing the priest's caprather than the expected royal headgear (Khonsu I, pp. xv-xvi, pls. 10, 35). As with the presentation ofMaat, this omission of a type of royal crown in the context of rituals previously reserved for royalty tempersthe usurpation. Specifically in the case of the Ruderlauf and Vasenlauf, the tempering is not only reflected inthe headgear but also by the static rather than active pose of the high priest.The sense of usurpation conveyed by the single scene of Pinudjem I presenting Maat (B27) is moder-ated not only by the appearance of the skullcap in place of a blue or other royal crown, but also by the com-position of the scene itself, because Pinudjem offers the image of the goddess not directly to a divine recipi-ent, but rather to an offering inscription in which the god Khonsu is evoked.KILT AND FOOTWEARFour types of masculine dress are shown in conjunction with the presentation of Maat; the short pleated'ndyt kilt66 typical of the Opfertanz and heb sed ceremonies, a short kilt,67 a long voluminous kilt,68 and ashort kilt with an intermediate length overskirt cut on the bias.69 The short and long kilts can appear with atriangular panel.70 With the exception of the sndyt, the kilts are usually worn with a sporran decorated withuraei, and in the majority of the examples the kilt is decorated with the symbolic bull's tail. None of theseforms of royal costume is associated exclusively with the presentation of Maat.71 The variation in types ofdress is especially evident in double scenes where the king presents Maat and another offering and there isno attempt to differentiate the donor's clothing.72There is no characteristic dress worn by women who present Maat. In the case of the God's Wives, thewomen wear the long pleated gown with two shoulder straps which is their standard garb.73The only example (Jl 1) from the Amarna period that preserves the queen's dress and crown portraysNefertiti wearing a pleated gown.62. The headdress is indistinct in example K7. See Leclant1965: 355-56 for further remarks on the crowns.63. For the rebus that Herihor presents being the prenomen ofRamessesses XI, see Teeter 1986b: 177-84.64. Herihor: A28-29, 31-33; E4; Khonsu I, pls. 15, 45, 51, 62,97; Pinudjem: B27.65.

This type of skirt appears only on certain monuments; forexample, it does not appear in the reliefs in the Temple ofSeti I at Gourna nor on the Enclosure wall at Karnak, ex-cept in the context of the Opfertanz and the heb-sed (Osing1977, pl. 26). However, at the Temple of Khonsu, in theFirst Court, there are many examples of Herihor andRamesses XI wearing such a kilt while engaged in the pre-sentation of Maat and in the course of more routine offer-ing rituals (E4, F21-22). In each of the examples at theTemple of Khonsu, the king/high priest is kneeling.67. Khonsu I, pls. 15, 36 (= A33), 45, 104 (= A29).68.

There are many examples; see Osing 1977: 27 for his list-ing of SpLS and SpS types.71.

The six scenes of Ramesses II presenting his nameor Maat in the Temple of Seti I at Gourna consistently por-tray him wearing the combined long and short skirt withthe triangular front panel (Osing 1977, pls. 3 [= G2], 11 [=F81, 16, 24, 25 [= A9], 35).

The portrayal of the king on the High Gate, as reflectedthrough the king's appearance with and without sandals, could indicate that the High Gate was consideredto be a public area of the temple, an area of transitional sanctity.\" Although the king officiates before thegods, he appears shod in the presence of his subjects. The theme of the reliefs also emphasizes the publicnature of this section of the structure. The east and west facades, as well as the passage, are dominated byvignettes of the king presenting defeated enemies to the god(s), scenes which were for public consumption.The many scenes depicting the High Priest Herihor offering to the gods while wearing sandals are moredifficult to explain.77 There does not appear to be any connection between the location of the scene in thecourt, the action, and the dress of the officiant. For example, Herihor is portrayed receiving jubilees fromthe gods as he kneels with sandals on (Khonsu I, pls. 50, 58, 69A) and in other occurrences of the sameritual without sandals (ibid., pls. 54, 57A, 65). This inconsistency is carried over into the scenes of him pre-senting Maat.78MAATPOSTUREWith few exceptions, in scenes of the royal presentation of Maat, the goddess is shown in profile as aseated figure whose gown is drawn down over her knees. Four scenes from the royal context depict the god-dess standing rather than sitting (pls. 18-21). Each of these scenes is differentiated from the standard ico-nography by the omission of a dedication inscription.79 In none of the scenes is it clear whether the king ispresenting or receiving Maat or his name to or from the god, or if the upheld hands of the king and the godmerely support the flat platform upon which the goddess or name stands. All four exceptional scenes alludeto the association of Maat with the royal name.A scene on the west doorway of the first court of Luxor Temple appears to be unique because Maat isdepicted in the form of an unguent jar (pl. 15). Although the scene is damaged and details of the iconogra-phy are hard to distinguish, Maat appears to sit in her conventional posture (with gown over knees) upon anelongated platform. A figure of the king is on one knee; the other leg outstretched behind him appears tosupport or present the Maat figure. This type of iconography is known from other statues of Ramesses II thatrepresent the king presenting an altar-shaped object, or a rebus of his own name.80 This shared iconographyof the presentation of Maat depicted on the doorway of Luxor Temple and statues of the king presenting arebus of his name is another indication of the close association of the two rituals.74. For example, in the Court at the Temple of Khonsu, thereare many examples of the high priest wearing sandals ashe officiates before the gods (Khonsu I, pls. 17, 27, 32, 34.38-39. 48, 50, 53, 59. passim). Two scenes of the proces-sion of the divine barks depict some of the priests wearingsandals; other scenes, in which the same barks are sup-ported, depict some of the priests without sandals (ibid.,pls. 44, 69B).75. Ramesses III presents Maat or his name to the god whilewearing sandals (MH VIII, pls. 603, 608, 617B-C). Butnoteat the king also appears shod in other, very non-public areas of the temple, e.g., at the treasury and otherrooms in the back of the temple (MH V, pls. 328, 331; MHVII, pls. 504, 512A-B, 513A-B, 515, 516 [partial listing ofreferences]). The sandals were erased from two scenes(MH V, pl. 331; MH VII, pl. 513), which is curious sinceadjacent scenes where the king wears sandals were notchanged.76. The king appears with sandals in all of the reliefs of theHigh Gate with the exception of, inconsistently, the scenes77.78.paired on the left and right jambs of the passage (eastface; MH VIII, pl. 618A, B [left jamb], E, G [right jamb,topmost scene], which show the king with sandals; ibid., pl.618F, which shows the king without sandals; ibid., pl. 618C[bottommost of left jamb] is damaged). The east portal ofthe main passage, north and south reveals (ibid., pl. 619),also reflects this inconsistency. The placement of the reliefof Ptah \"who hears petitions\" (B24) in the central passageindicates that this area was frequented by members of thecommunity.See references in footnote 74, above.Of the fourteen scenes that depict High Priest Herihor pre-senting Maat or a name, three such scenes show theofficiant wearing sandals (Khonsu 1, pls. 74 [= A281,141C-D [= A301). The baseline of two scenes is damaged(ibid., pls. 82, 97).79. See, however, plate 18, G I, in which an enigmatic dedica-tion and divine recitation appear above the representation.80.

Thus life was given to himwho has peace and death was given to him who has sin\" (Morenz 1973: 116). Without Maat, there would beno life and therefore the scepter serves as a determinative for the goddess' sphere of influence.A relief of Herihor presenting Maat in the Temple of Khonsu omits the staff in the hands of the god-dess (Khonsu I, pl. 51 [left]); this omission may be due to the cramped composition in which the legs of thegoddess are nearly tucked under the top of the ws-staff leaving no room for the goddess' emblem.PLATFORMThe figure of Maat is most commonly seated upon a nb-basket.84 The composition forms the rebus nbMaat \"the possessor of the qualities of Maat,\" a reflection upon the character of the donor of the image.85The nb is used as a platform for few other objects; the most significant being the red or white crown or em-blems related to the crowns.86On the north jamb of the west door of the Ramesses II court at Luxor Temple, Maat sits on a flat plat-form of what appears to be an ointment jar (pl. 15).87 The dedication (hnk M.?'t n itf...) makes it clear that81.

So, too, a scene on the northern revealof the bark sanctuary of Ramesses IV in the Temple of Khonsu shows the rebus of the king's name in theform of an ointment jar (PM II, 237 (47) b.I). As with all scenes of the presentation of the rebus of the nameof Ramesses IV, that scene lacks a dedication which directly equates the rebus with Maat.8ICONOGRAPHY OF THE NAME REBUS EQUATED WITH MAATScenes of the Ramesside king presenting his prenomen to the gods display considerable variation iniconography. In some cases, all of the phonetic values that make up the royal name are clearly incorporatedin the rebus, while in others, certain phonograms of the rebus are supplied by elements of the overall com-position.REBUSES THAT EXPRESS ALL PHONETIC COMPONENTSThe earliest examples of the presentation of the name, in which the dedication inscription equates therebus with Maat date to the reign of Seti I. These rebuses incorporate all phonetic elements of theprenomen Mn M't R'. Examples from the time of Seti I substitute a hawk-headed figure of Re with a diskon his head for the Maat figure (FI-4; LD III, pl. 139b). The phonetic value of Maat is expressed by meansof a feather that the god holds. The divine figure sits upon the game board mn-sign, thereby completingSeti's prenomen Mn M?'t R'.The prenomen of Ramesses II (Wsr MC't R') is also fully expressed by rebuses. The form of these com-positions is directly influenced by the rebuses of his father. With few exceptions8 the monogram ofRamesses II, as with the rebuses of Seti I, is composed of a hawk-headed figure with the sun disk on hishead who holds a Maat feather.9 0 The wsr-sign stands in front of the figure. The rebus is positioned on a nb-or mr-hieroglyph.Other forms of the rebus of the name of Ramesses II are attested at Abu Simbel, Gourna, and LuxorTemple.9\" One of the Gourna examples (F8) could represent a transition in the iconography because aseated figure with a human face is substituted for the Re figure. The seated figure is apparently a combina-tion of the king and Re because the face is human, yet it wears a sun disk (\"Re\") on its head. The sign maybe an allusion to the association of the king and the sun god. The phonetic value for Maat is supplied by theostrich feather that the figure holds. As is customary with the rebuses of the names of Ramesses II, the wsr-hieroglyph stands in front of the figure.A further variation that occurs upon the facade of the Great Temple at Abu Simbel92 displays a combi-nation of several forms of the rebus. There, the feather of Maat is surrounded by the sun disk of Re and thegoddess (with a human face) carries a wsr-form scepter.The name rebuses of Ramesses III are derived from those of Ramesses II that employ a figure of Maat.The rebus writings of the name of Ramesses III are, in appearance, more closely related to the iconographyof the ritual of the offering of Maat because a wholly conventional figure of Maat (i.e., sitting on a nb-sign)makes up the central element of the composition. The use of the hawk-headed figure to convey the value\"Re\" seems to have been discarded by Ramesses III and examples of the Re element in his prenomen beingexpressed by means of the therianthropic form of the sun god are lacking.There is far less variation in the monograms of Ramesses III than is evident in rebuses of Ramesses II.In the Twentieth Dynasty examples, every example of the rebus of the prenomen Wsr M;rt R' (which lacksthe epithet Mry lmn) is made up of the seated figure of Maat holding an (nOa-sign, her feather emblem on88.

In one of these examples (F12) from the High Gate atMedinet Habu, the entire composition is placed upon a flat mr-base, thereby completing the epithet. Thelower portion of the other example (F13) is damaged, but the addition of the Amun figure makes it probablethat the base was a mr-sign.The many rebus writings of the prenomen of Ramesses IV (iHk? M t RI) in the reliefs of the Temple ofKhonsu95 show great uniformity. The feather of the central Maat figure is surrounded by an outline of thedisk of Re and the goddess holds the heka-scepter. The rebus sits on the usual nb-base. A single examplefrom Wadi Hammamat (G3) places the sun disk between the Maat figure and her scepter.One example of the rebus of the name can be cited for Ramesses V (F19) and for Ramesses VI (F20),respectively. The example of Ramesses V appears as \"ir4 and includes the epithet Sbpr n R', assumingthat the R' in the prenomen does \"double duty.\" For another resolution to the reading of this name, see Pho-netic Values of the Rebus Supplied by Elements of the Scene, below.The rebus of the name of Ramesses VI (F20), similar to the examples of Seti I, replaces Maat with thehawk-headed figure of Re who holds a Maat feather. The composition rests upon a nb-sign, which com-pletes the rebus of the prenomen Nb MIt R'. This incorporation of the nb into the phonetic makeup of theprenomen rebus is unique.Examples of rebus writings of the royal name employed in offering scenes for Ramesses VII-X arelacking. The composition of the name rebuses of Ramesses XI are similar to those of Seti I with whom heshared the prenomen Mn M?'t R (Khonsu II, pl. 157). Examples of the rebus of Ramesses XI that are com-pleted by other elements in the composition are discussed in the following section.PHONETIC VALUES OF THE REBUS SUPPLIED BY ELEMENTS OF THE SCENEThere are examples of the writing of the rebus of the king's name that lack expected phonograms. Theability of the ancient Egyptians to incorporate text and representation has no better illustration than themanner in which these missing elements of the rebus are supplied by other features of the presentationscene.One of the more common ways in which a phonetic sign is supplied to an otherwise incomplete writingis through the incorporation of the phonetic value of the name of the recipient into the rebus, which is seen,for example, in a relief of Ramesses II in the Gourna Temple (pl. 22, loc. Gourna 166). In that relief theking offers a composition of Maat holding an 'n-sign. The tall wsr-sign is in front of her. There is no indi-cation of a disk on the head of or in front of the goddess nor, anticipating an argument pursued below, isthere a solar disk over the head of the king. The logical solution is to take the phonetic value of the recipientof the offering, Amun-Re, as completing the omitted Re portion of the rebus.Another example from Gourna (F7) is also apparently missing the Re element. In this scene, the rebusis dominated by a figure that, because of the human face and feather on her head, is surely Maat. The tradi-tional (nh-scepter of Maat is replaced with a redundant Maat feather and augmented by a small staff in theform of the wsr-hieroglyph.Certain scenes that omit the Re element of the rebus include a sun disk on whose uraei are hung mul-tiple \"n -signs above the king's head. Examples appear in the reliefs of Ramesses II in the Gourna Templeof Seti I,\" in the work of Ramesses III on the High Gate at Medinet Habu,97 and in a scene of Ramesses XIat the Temple of Khonsu.98 Such scenes do raise the possibility that the omitted Re element of the rebus is93.

This scene that appears on the High Gate at Medinet Habu(F12) depicts the king presenting a rebus composed of Amun and wsr upon a mr-sign. Here, the values Reand Maat are supplied by the recipient (Amun-Re) and his attendant (Maat) (Teeter 1986b: 175-77).Another solution to completing the phonetic values in this scene is to assume that the rebus itself con-veys the value of Maat, which is supported by the dedication inscription accompanying many scenes (FI-8,10-13, 18-22) that equates the name with Maat.99 In one exceptional scene of the presentation of a rebus ofthe nomen (HI), the rebus is composed of a seated figure of a child, his finger to his mouth (ms), who wearsa sun disk (Re) on his head. The figure is seated upon a bolt s-hieroglyph that in turn is placed upon the nb-sign, which traditionally appears under Maat. This rebus incorporates all the phonetic values of the nomenRI ms s(w).'1 The name, however, does not include any phonetic value for Maat, yet the dedication inscrip-tion directly equates the entire rebus with Maat: nk m M t n itf ...With the association of the rebus itself with Maat, the scene at Medinet Habu that shows Ramesses IIIpresenting a rebus to Amun-Re and Maat (F14) might be more conventional; the missing phonetic element\"Maat\" would be supplied by the rebus itself rather than by the identity of the attendant.There are at least two other examples which indicate that indeed the rebus was considered to contributethe phonetic value Maat to an otherwise incomplete rebus. One such example appears in the GournaTemple of Seti I, decorated by Ramesses II (pl. 23, loc. Gourna 357). The rebus that the king presents toMut is composed of a hawk-headed figure with a sun disk on his head who holds an Inh-sign. He is seatedon the flat mr-sign and a wsr-sign stands in front of him. The omitted Maat element could be supplied onlyby the rebus itself.'0'Another example occurs in the reliefs of Ramesses XI in the Temple of Khonsu (F21 = Khonsu II, pl.177). There, the rebus Mn M?'t R' is made up of a figure with a disk on its head who holds a combined 'nh-flower scepter'0 2 and is seated upon the game board mn-sign. In this example, the gender of the seated fig-ure is unclear; although the fillet around the head and the coiffure suggests it is female. As is customary, theprofile of the hieroglyph does not give any hint as to its gender by an indication of breasts. Here, the figurecould be a human-headed Re, and the rebus itself Maat; or the figure could be Maat without her character-istic feather symbol.One last example is damaged and somewhat doubtful. Located in the southeast corner of the Ramessidecourt at Luxor Temple (F5), the scene is composed of a seated figure who wears a sun disk on its head. Afissure in the stone makes it difficult to tell if a Maat feather was placed alongside the sun disk.0 3 If not, therebus itself would supply the value Maat. The doubling of attributes in headdresses (the combination of os-trich feather and sun disk) is attested in reliefs of Ramesses IV in the Temple of Khonsu (F15-18; loc. KM371, 450).THE ADDITION OF EXTRA PHONETIC ELEMENTS TO THE REBUSIn several examples, the usual nb-base of the goddess Maat in the rebus is replaced by the flat mr-sign.In scenes of Ramesses III, in which the rebus incorporates the value Amun or in which Amun acts as the re-cipient,' the mr-sign is considered to be a component of the royal epithet mry 'lmn \"beloved of Amun.\"99.

Hence in the scenes wherein the king presents therebus on a mr-sign to Amun, the rebus is considered to express the prenomen with its less common epithet.However, in the case of the scenes where Amun is not a recipient, and therefore that phonetic value is lack-ing, the mr is fulfilling a different function, namely the formation of the epithet mry M?'t \"beloved ofMaat,\" which is attested as a variant of the Horus name of Ramesses II (Kitchen 1984: 236). In such cases,the entire rebus should again be considered to function as the phonogram \"Maat.\"THE RECIPIENT(S)With only five exceptions, Maat is presented to a representation of a deity.0 7 A full range of gods andgoddesses appears in this role.\"0 As might be expected, the patron deity of the temple is the most commonrecipient, although Amun often is the recipient in Theban temples dedicated to other deities.o9oAs with other types of offering scenes, the recipient faces the donor (and Maat) and is depicted in apassive stance; no effort is made to reach out to the donor, nor is there any direct interaction such as placinga hand on the donor's shoulder. Maat serves as the link between the two parties, not only iconographically,but also theologically.\"0ATTENDANTSIn many examples of the ritual, Maat or the royal name is presented in the presence of one or more at-tendants who stand behind the donor or recipient. In almost all examples, this figure is a divinity. Many dif-ferent gods fill this role including Thoth (A28, El, F22), Seshat (B23, F13), Mut (A14, 30; B6), Maat (El-4),\" Hathor (A31, B8), Sekhmet (F20), Sobek (FlI), Amunet (F15), Isis (F17), and Montu (A21, B25).The attendant(s) stand behind the donor (A13, 30-31; B8; F15, 17) or behind the primary recipient (A6,105. F5-6; loc. Gourna 166 (pl. 22); loc. KI 169 (Oriental Insti-tute negative no. 6315); OIP 106, pl. 136.106. Plate 23; G2; Habachi 1969, pl. 5a (Abu Simbel).107. In three of the five scenes where the divine recipient is notdepicted, he or she is referred to in the dedication formula:Amunhotep III presents Maat to an inscription of Thoth(A2); naos of Nectanebo (CG 70016) where the king pre-sents Maat toward his cartouches, narrated by the dedica-tion hnk M't n mwtf(Roeder 1914, pi. 12b). In this case,another portion of the inscription indicates that mwtf isBastet, who is not otherwise depicted. Pinudjem presentsMaat to a dedication inscription (B27) with the dedicationhnk M?'t n fnsw ... .As with the scene from the naos, thedivine recipient is not actually represented. The other twoexceptional scenes show the king presenting Maat to thedonor's name rather than to a deity. Ramesses III presentsMaat to a rebus of his prenomen and the cartouches of hisnomen (Hilscher 1941, pl. 36b). There is no dedication ofthe offering that refers to the identity of the recipient. Thefinal example (J12), a seal impression excavated atAmarna, shows Akhenaton presenting Maat to his ownprenomen; there is no dedication.108. For example, in the funerary Temple of Ramesses III thefollowing deities receive Maat: Amun, Amun-Re, Amun-Re-Kamutef, Re, Re-Horakhty, Ptah (in several aspects),Khonsu, Shu-wepet, Thoth (as a standard), Atum, Ptah-Sokar, Osiris, Harsiese, Onuris, Seth, Hornefer, Montu,and Sobek.Hornung (1989: 138), however, suggests that there is amore restricted group of gods to whom Maat is presentedand states, more directly: \"But it would be inconceivableto present Maat to either Seth or Mont, the war god\" (ibid.,p. 139). For a scene of the presentation of Maat to Seth,see A18 and MH VII, pl. 576B (Ramesses III presentsMaat to Montu of Thebes). The identity of the recipient ismore a function of the location of the scene (i.e., patrondeity of the structure) than any definite list of deities whowere considered to be appropriate recipients. Since Montuis so closely associated with the power of the king and thestate, and the recitation of divine recipients is often so bel-ligerent (I have given to you kn-power / nbt-strength /phty-strength), it is surprising that Montu is not more fre-quently portrayed as a recipient of Maat. For these at-tributes given by the god, see Chapter 5: The Gods' Dona-tion, below.109. For example, of the sixteen examples of the presentationof the prenomen and/or Maat in the Court and First Hypo-style Hall at the Temple of Khonsu, Amun is the recipientin eight of the scenes; Khonsu I, pl. 82; Khonsu II, pl.157A) and Khonsu is the recipient in five scenes (E4;Khonsu I, pls. 15, 51, 62, 97).110. As noted by Bergman 1972: 92-93.111. Hornung (1992: 134) suggests that these scenes of Maatas an attendant indicate \"that the god has power over herand will continue to exercise it.\" However, the text thatHomrnung uses to elucidate this text is from a private tomb.Hornung also comments that Maat stands behind Re as hisdaughter, just as Isis stands behind the throne of herbrother Osiris. However, this does not seem to be asignificant pattern because Maat stands behind the king(E2) or behind the recipient, who is a god other than Re(El, 4).31oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE PRESENTATION OF MAAT: RITUAL AND LEGITIMACY IN ANCIENT EGYPT15-16, 19; B6, 9). Attendants are located behind both the primary recipient and the donor (A14, 17, 23, 28;B23, 25; C12; El; F11, 13, 19, 21), or very rarely before the donor or recipient.\"' The more common com-positions in offering scenes are the placement of a single attendant on either side of the scene or the place-ment of two figures behind the recipient.The presence or absence of attendant figures in offering scenes does not appear to conform to any dis-tinct pattern. For example, the reliefs on the Enclosure Wall at the Temple of Karnak are almost exclu-sively made up of donor/recipient groupings without attendants. The exceptions to this pattern are the ritualscenes in which a third being would normally be involved, such as conducting the king into the presence ofthe gods, the coronation, and the awarding of scepters (Helck 1968, pls. 6, 8, 56). The use of attendants inoffering scenes is also relatively rare in the Ramesses II section of the Seti Gouma Temple. There, of thethree scenes which incorporate attendants, one is the Vasenlauf (Osing 1977, pl. 26 [top]), which does notfall into the strict category of an offering scene. The remaining two scenes record the presentation of milk tothe Theban Triad and wine to Amun in the presence of Mut (ibid., pls. 25 [top], 43b). The decoration of theinterior of the Hypostyle Hall at Karnak illustrates the variability in the use of attendants. Some areas of thetemple are decorated with motifs of donor and recipient, and other adjacent areas incorporate attendants. Inyet other areas, such scenes are mixed together with no apparent pattern.\"3Like many of the other aspects of the presentation of Maat, the addition of divine attendants to an offer-ing scene is not unique to scenes of the presentation of Maat, and there is no apparent association betweenthe offering and the presence or identity of the attendant.The divine attendants function as witnesses to the action of the presentation, be it Maat or another typeof donation. The role of these attendants purely as attendants and not as direct recipients of the offering isconfirmed by the address of the dedication that is in the singular form n ftf\"to his father\" and n nb M 't \"tothe possessor of Maat\" rather than in the plural.\"4 The presence of the attendants strengthens and confirmsthe action of the donor, and in cases where the donor and recipient are flanked by such deities, the pair isliterally surrounded by the support of the divine world. sRegardless of the side of the composition on which attendants appear, their recitation is couched in thesame di.n(.) n.k form as the recipient, and in some examples the \"speech\" of the attendant behind the do-nor appears in a more elaborate form, referring to monuments or other aspects of kingship (A28, 30; F22).In a number of examples, a divine attendant stands behind the donor, holding the year rib staff or inscribingyears or jubilees for the donor in addition to intoning the di.n(.i) n.k formula (A23, B25).116\" This figureserves a special function of adding strength and legitimacy to the ritual and further perpetuating the dona-tion.In a scene of Ramesses II presenting Maat to Re-Horakhty in the presence of Seti I (B 11), the divineattendant behind the donor is replaced by a deified ruler who by virtue of his deification can act as an atten-dant in the ritual. In this scene, the deification of Seti I and therefore the appropriateness of his role as anattendant is indicated by his action: sntr n R' Hr qihty nb pt ... \"censing to Re-Horakhty, Lord of the Sky.\"As Bell (1985a: 281) suggests, \"By paronomasia, this (sntr, which here is a pun for to \"become a god\") is112. The deified Ahmose Nofertari appears before the donor inthe Thutmoside South Court at Karnak (D3), in a scene ofRamesses fit presenting Maat to Amun. In a similar scenein the tomb of Ramesses IX, a small figure of Maat standsbefore Ptah, to whom Ramesses IX presents Maat (E3).113. Areas in which there is no discernible pattern include thesouth wall (OIP 106, pl. 259) and the west wall, south half(ibid., pl. 258). Other areas do display a pattern; e.g., eastwall, north half (ibid., pl. 264). where the majority of thescenes show only the donor and recipient, with the excep-tion of the last scene on the third section of the wall fromthe left (ibid., pls. 205, 209, 214, 222), where the offeringis made in the presence of another divinity. This pattern isrepeated on the southern portion of that wall (ibid., pl.260), where, with the exception of non-offering scenessuch as purification (ibid., pl. 105) and being conductedinto the presence of the gods (ibid., pl. 106), the leftmostscene of the second portion of the wall from the right aloneincorporates attendants into the composition (ibid., pls. 89,102). There is an exception to the pattern (ibid., pl. 88),which depicts the shaking of a sistrum to Amun-Re andIsis. This scene perhaps is located in the upper register be-cause it was crowded out of place in the middle register bythe insertion of an additional donor/recipient scene (ibid.,pl. 95).114. See however, Frankfort 1933, pl. 51. in which Seti I pre-sents Maat to Horus and Osiris with the dedication hnkMt n nb(w) 77 Mt. See Edel 1955/64, §214, 243aa,for this as a writing of the singular form of the noun.115. See A17, Great Temple at Medinet Habu, in whichKhonsu stands behind the king, Mut behind Amun, andboth attendants assume the same protective gesture.116. The use of the rib behind the donor is especially commonin the Court and Hypostyle Hall at Khonsu (A28, 30-31;F22). Other examples from the Temple of Ramesses III atKarnak show the attendant with the year staff in a variety32oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"ICONOGRAPHYwhat the king receives in his turn ... .\" The respective actions of the donor and his attendant are very clear.As the royal successor, Ramesses II presents Maat, the duty of the living king, while he is literally backedup by his attendant, the now deified Seti I, who as a symbol of his role and status performs the act of sntr. Arelated example of deified royalty acting as an attendant appears in the sun court of the same templewherein Ahmose Nofertari stands behind Amun as Ramesses performs the Vasenlauf.\"NON-DIVINE ATTENDANTSA non-divine figure may serve as an attendant in an offering scene.'8 In this type of scene, the donor isof royal or semi-royal status (God's Wives, queen), while the non-divine attendant is most often a memberof the royal family.\"'9 The attendant's function in the scenes of the God's Wives was to strengthen the effi-cacy of the donation by enhancing the status of the donor before the gods, which could be viewed as an at-tempt to bolster the provisional regnancy of these women and their ability to participate in, or usurp, purelyroyal rituals.120 As agents of the king, the women perform a ritual that was thought to be essential to worldorder and to the well-being of the state. In this context, the women's major domos who assist them in the ex-ecution of state administration appear with them to add to the power of legitimacy that is essential for theefficacious presentation of Maat.A scene that bridges the iconography of the divine and non-divine attendant is seen in the decoration ofa lintel from the chapel of Osiris Padiankh,'2' in which Amunirdis I acts as an attendant for her successor,Shepenwepet II. Here, Amunirdis is positioned behind a divine attendant by virtue of her status as m lfrw,which distinguishes her from non-divine attendants. However, her relative status in reference to the divineattendant, Isis, is distinguished by the absence of the di.n(.) n.k formula that is normally intoned by thegoddess.122A similar situation, with the same explanation, is encountered on the lunette of the Dream Stela (A34).There, Tanwetamani offers Maat to Amun as Piry (his wife) shakes a sistrum behind him. Here, she is not arecipient in the ritual, but rather through her cultic action she aids the king in its successful execution.A different situation, although couched in a similar composition, is seen on the Bubastite Portal (Ll)wherein Prince Osorkon stands behind his father Takalot II, who is embraced by Amun. Here, Osorkon as-sumes the position of attendant for his father. However, Osorkon himself presents Maat to the god, essen-tially ignoring the presence of his father.CONCLUSIONSThe overall iconography of the scenes of the presentation of Maat serves to stress the link that Maatformed between the gods and the donor (Bergman 1972: 92-93). The goddess appears between the partici-pants, frozen in the midst of the moment of presentation. She faces the recipient, as the donor does, becauseof types of offering scenes: incense (RIK I, pls. 37A, 42G,45E); ointment (ibid., pis. 37C, 52D, 61A); nw-vessels(ibid., pis. 54C, 61B, 75B-C; RIK II, pl. 97C); flowers(RIK I, pls. 52C; 53B, D); Maat (ibid., pls. 44G, 54D); theprenomen (RIK II, pl. 97F); also at the Ambulatory of theTemple of Khonsu: flowers (PM II, 235 (38) I = loc. KM391); name (ibid., 236 (41) 1 = loc. KM 374); insignia(ibid., (41) 11.2 = loc. KM 377).117. Osing 1977, pl. 26 (top).

As with the scene of Shepenwepet II, the deceasedAmunirdis stands behind the divine recipient and is ac-companied only by her name and titles.33oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"THE PRESENTATION OF MAAT: RITUAL AND LEGITIMACY IN ANCIENT EGYPTthe donor in this context is indicating that although Maat initially came from the gods, in the ritual Maatflows back from the king through his pious actions to the gods. This iconographic convention stresses the ac-tive, continuing, and eternal nature of the ritual, of the interplay between the donations of the gods, and theking's duty to uphold Maat and her precepts.The royal nature of the ritual is reflected most clearly in the regalia assumed by the donor. The bluecrown numerically dominates these scenes because of the crown's association with the legitimacy of theruler,12 3 a principle that is associated with the presentation of Maat, whereas the regional crowns (red orwhite) are rarely found because they did not adequately emphasize the significance of the ritual for all ofEgypt.In some occurrences of the scene, the presentation of Maat is further associated with the more signifi-cant rituals of kingship and legitimacy through the use of the hb-sign as a platform for the kneeling donor.This base is used in conjunction with the presentation of Maat (A28, 31, 33), the royal name (F21-22), andwith scenes of the coronation,124 all rituals that are directly associated with royal prerogative.The basic composition of the presentation of Maat does not differ from other types of ritual scenes. At-tendants may or may not appear in the scenes, and they may appear in varying numbers and in various posi-tions.In essence, there is little about the iconography of this particular type of scene to set it apart from thepresentation of other offerings. It is this similarity that provides the key to the iconography of the ritual; thepresentation of Maat is not so much like all the other types of scenes, as they are like the presentation ofMaat. To the Egyptian mind, the presentation of Maat was not a unique and isolated ritual, but one in whichall others were subsumed; all were an integrated reflection of the relationship between the king and godswhich affected mankind.The only manner in which the presentation of Maat is distinguished from other types of offering scenesis in the form of the Maat offering itself. Rather than presenting an emblem or some other related non-an-thropoid object, the figure of the goddess herself is offered to the gods. The tiny figure symbolizes an activeand more potent offering than an inanimate object, and in the course of this particular ritual, the small di-vine figure, imbued with the power of right doing, symbolizes the active cooperation between the king andthe world of the gods, mediated by the goddess Maat.The iconography of the goddess who is presented to the gods is, with the exception of her associationwith the royal name, invariable. Her feather is the phonetic value of her name, and the 'nh-scepter symbol-izes her domain. Her base, the nb, is found under a very limited number of objects, including crowns,clepsydra, and in its variant hb-form, under sed festivals.'2 5 These items are related; all are abstract symbolsof royalty and legitimacy and all are within the domain of Maat, because it is by upholding the principles ofMaat that the king sits upon the throne and is granted years of rule. The concept of time (as symbolized bythe clepsydra) and order are intimately related to the domain of Maat. In the context of the ritual, the nb-base under the tiny Maat figure which is presented completes a rebus for an epithet of the donor, he or shebeing the \"possessor of the qualities of Maat.\"26From the time of Seti I onward,'27 there was a conscious effort to equate the presentation of Maat andthe royal name through shared iconography. From the Nineteenth Dynasty onward, this identification wasso complete that scenes of the presentation of the royal name are captioned as \"presenting Maat,\"'128 andthat in turn, only prenomens which include the goddess' name are presented to the gods.'129 It is with the in-corporation of Maat into the royal name in the Ramesside period that the goddess' traditional feather head-123.

This connection is very clear in certain offer-ing scenes of Ramesses XI at the Temple of Khonsu, in which the scepter that Maat carries in a rebus of theking's prenomen which is presented is shown in forms other than the usual In6. In each such example, thevariations in the staff are carried over to the representation of the goddess who appears in the king'sprenomen cartouche.o3 This shared iconography stresses the closeness of the relationship between the kingand the goddess.The incorporation of Maat's name into virtually all of the prenomens of the Twentieth Dynasty13' coin-cides with the use of the presentation of Maat as a standard motif in temple decoration. These two uses ofthe image of the goddess, which are related through the presentation of the Ramesside prenomen equatedwith Maat, reflect a vastly increased prominence of Maat in the period following the Eighteenth Dynasty.'32The assumption of prenomens compounded with Maat and the subsequent presentation of those namesequated with Maat through the offering inscription are a reflection of the king's striving for closer associa-tion with Maat and with her inherent moral values that had constituted the traditional principles of behaviorin the pre-Ramesside era. This new emphasis upon Maat rituals in the Ramesside period is also clearly indi-cated by the absence of any equation of the prenomen with Maat (as attested by the presentation of theprenomen) until the advent of the Nineteenth Dynasty. Assmann relates the late New Kingdom referencesto Maat to the erosion of the Ramesside kings' sense of confidence to rule according to their own will andinitiative (which was always tempered and guided by the precepts of Maat), as well as to a growing senseof fate and reliance upon the gods.133 According to this scenario, the increase in scenes of the presentationof Maat, or the royal name equated with the goddess, would be viewed as striving to recapture the guidancewhich the precepts of the goddess had provided, but which was being eroded with the growth of personal pi-ety.134Objections to this interpretation are expressed in the final conclusions of this work.130. Khonsu II, pls. 157, 177 (= F21); cf. also Teeter 1986b:182, no. 12.131. The only exception is Ramesses IX. There are more ex-ceptions in the Nineteenth Dynasty: Ramesses I andMerneptah have Maat in their nomens, Amunmese andTwosert honor the goddess in their Horus names, and thetitularies of Seti II and Siptah omit any mention of Maat.132.

Some assert that the scenes on the walls of a particular monu-ment are related to the rituals that were performed in that chamber.' Others suggest that certain scenes al-ways appear in specific areas of temples.2 Most recently, Poo discounts any relationship of the scenes to thefunction of the structure,3 suggesting that the ritual representations function as symbols of the king's piety oras decorative motifs rather than as narration for rituals. Hence, according to Poo's thesis, we should not ex-pect offering scenes to conform to a predictable order or sequence.Studies of the order and sequence of offering scenes tend to concentrate on what deities are involved inthe offering rather than on what objects are exchanged between the rituals' participants.4 These studieshave successfully shown that on certain monuments the deities are not randomly placed, but more com-monly their arrangement expresses alternate aspects of a particular god5 or local and regional groupings.6Other scholars have turned their attention to the relationship of the offering to the overall scene, spe-cifically why a certain object is offered to certain gods and whether a specific type of offering scene occursin a particular area of a temple, tomb, or other structure.7Although the majority of comments pertaining to the sequence of the presentation of Maat or the royalname are based upon the reliefs in Ptolemaic temples,8 certain scholars have commented on the location ofthe scenes of the presentation of Maat in the New Kingdom and Late New Kingdom temples. Goff (1979:180), apparently following Moret and Derchain, suggests that the ritual is found in the back of the templesanctuary. Osing (1977: 66-69 /associates the ritual with scenes of the presentation of incense and libation,wine and food. MylIiwiec (1985a: 9) states that, as a type of propaganda, scenes of the presentation ofMaat are an element of the decoration of the first court which abuts the temple's facade.A difficulty in dealing with the sequence of reliefs in temples is determining to what extent and in whatdirection the reliefs relate to each other. For example, does a scene in an upper register express a certainsequence with a scene below it, or does it have a special relevance only to the scenes on its immediate left1.

Recent studies show that there is no uniform orientation of temple scenes. For example, thescenes on the north half of the east wall of the Hypostyle Hall at the Temple of Amun at Karnak appear tohave a dominant right to left, horizontal pattern,9 while it has been suggested that the chapels in the Templeof Seti I at Abydos are to be read from alternating upper and lower registers, or strictly as separate upperand lower registers.'0 The columns of the Hypostyle Hall at Karnak are to be read in diagonal patternsthrough the hall rather than along the east-west or north-south orientation of the hall itself (Helck 1976: 57-65). The Enclosure Wall at Karnak is arranged as a mirror image of itself, the central scene located in themiddle, the other scenes radiating out horizontally from it (Helck 1968: 70-71). Winter (1968: 55-56) sug-gests that in the Ptolemaic period, some of the reliefs are to be read in vertical registers, from top to bottom.Generally, there does not appear to be a uniform ordering of the scenes. However, in many of theRamesside temples, the register lines give an indication that many series of scenes are to be read in sepa-rate horizontal registers, which is very evident in the Temple of Khonsu wherein the scenes within a regis-ter are of unequal size and their marginal inscriptions do not match up with scenes directly below, suggest-ing a horizontal sequence from right to left or left to right.\" The difference in registration lines from onewall surface to the one immediately adjacent to it suggests that, at least in that temple, the walls were to beread separately.'2An additional difficulty in determining the sequence of particular scenes is the variability in subjectmatter that was used as decoration in the temples. This variability is especially critical to our understandingwhen attempting to evaluate the importance of a specific ritual through a comparison of basic informationsuch as the relative incidence of the ritual's appearance. For example, one temple might rely more heavilyupon certain ritual themes that are not as prevalent in another temple, even though both temples were builtduring the same reign. The presentation of the royal name equated with Maat is relatively rare at MedinetHabu. Of sixty-eight examples of this type of presentation scene, only four (5%) display the rebus of theroyal name, but at the small Temple of Ramesses III at Karnak, the prenomen makes up 30% of suchscenes.\"3 The presentation of the royal name is not employed as a decorative theme in the Temple of Seti Iat Abydos,14 although it is encountered among the reliefs at his mortuary temple at Gourna.\"59.

The rebus is exclusivelyfavored on the exterior north wall (Osing 1977, pls. 3, I1,16); Maat is the only form of the offering within the suncourt (Osing 1977, pls. 24-25, 35). This penchant for oneform or the other is encountered in the Temple ofRamesses III at Karnak, in which the south wall showsonly the presentation of the rebus (F10-1 1; RIK 1, pl.97F) and the east wall shows only the presentation of theMaat figurine (RIK II, pls. 1031, 107B, 107E). It is possiblethat this reflects a desire to make the scenes of the presen-tation of the name, which is a symbol of the king's legiti-macy, visible without entering the temple proper. Thescenes on the east wall of the Karnak Temple are withinthe confines of the first court, and the scenes on the southwall were, in the time of Ramesses 111, the exterior of thetemple proper. The same case could tentatively be madefor the Gourna Temple. Although the temple was sur-rounded by a girdle wall, the scenes of the presentation ofthe name are on the exterior, and those of the offering ofMaat are in the court. This placement of scenes might bedue to the association of Maat and Re that would be ap-propriate to the decoration of a courtyard, as opposed tothe rebus scenes that stress the association of the king andMaat. For these latter scenes as a type of propaganda, seeMygliwiec 1985a: 9.38oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"SEQUENCE AND PATTERNSLOCATION OF SCENES OF THE PRESENTATION OF MAATNON-MONUMENTAL OCCURRENCESThe presentation of Maat is rarely encountered as a decorative theme in the non-monumental context.It is almost unknown as a vignette on papyrus.16 Several examples of the presentation of Maat are knownfrom Ramesside ostraca.'7 A number of bronze statues of priests, or of kings acting as high priest, present-ing Maat date to the Late period (M6-7). Although Maat herself is not an uncommon theme on jewelry,18the presentation of her image was only rarely used as decoration on pectorals, ring bezels, and scarabs.'9There are no examples of the presentation of Maat or of the royal name from the \"domestic\" context, i.e.,from wall or floor paintings from houses.OCCURRENCES ON MONUMENTSThe presentation of Maat is found upon Eighteenth Dynasty stelae (B3, C5), a naos (C2), a pedestal(A2), talatat from Karnak (Jl-10), a parapet fragment and seal impression from Amama (Jl1-12). In theRamesside period, there are many more examples that come from contexts as diverse as the apex of obe-lisks,20 pedestals or naoi,21 various stelae,22 and temples and royal tombs (see below). Three scenes thatshare many of the characteristics of the royal ritual are found in private tombs (pls. 3-5) and variations inthe theme are found in two other tombs at Deir el-Medina (pl. 1 [= MlI]; M2, which is questionable).By far the greatest number of scenes of the presentation of Maat are found among the reliefs that adornRamesside temples. The scene occurs in the areas of the temples that were accessible to the common folk,as well as in the inner sections of the structures.23 The presence of the scene in places of popular supplica-tion, in particular, opposite \"Amun Re in the thickness of the door\" at Medinet Habu24 and in the chapels ofsupplication and hearing petitions at Karnak,25 Luxor,26 and Medinet Habu,27 indicate that the commonpeople were familiar with depictions of the ritual.28 The association of the presentation of Maat with placesof popular supplication continues through the Late period and even into the Roman era as attested by therepresentation of the presentation of Maat commissioned by Domitian on the north and south exterior walls16.

At Karnak, the Ramesside easterntemple is decorated with scenes of the presentation ofMaat or the name equated with Maat (PM II, 207; 211(29) e, h (30) 2, (31) 2). In the Triple Shrine of Seti II atKarnak, there is a scene of the presentation of Maat in theAmun shrine wherein the structure is specifically called aplace of supplication and prayer (KRI IV, 254.6). Thechapel of Khonsu of the Seti II shrine is decorated withtwo addition scenes of the presentation of Maat, one inthe Mut chapel and one on the facade (cf. PM II, 25 (27)(29) 2). Other areas of the shrine are also decorated withscenes of the presentation of Maat (PM II, 26 (31) e, (35)a, (37) 1.4, 11.3). At Luxor Temple, the king presenting hisname as Maat (F5) takes up much of the southeast wall ofthe forecourt. This southeast corner of the temple is calleda \"place of prayer and hearing petitions\" (KRI II, 607.14-15). THE western door that is referred to as a place ofsupplication (KRI II, 610.7-8, 10, 12) is also decoratedwith a scene of the presentation of Maat (PM II, 307 (23)II b).

Scenes of the presentation of the goddess occur on the back of the southern porter's lodgeand many times in the passage through the High Gate.3\" The portal of the first pylon is ornamented with twoscenes of the presentation of Maat, and the stela to the south of the doorway depicts the king presentingMaat.3 2 As Nims (1954: 79-80) and Fischer (1959: 196-98) indicate, the second court was also, at least onoccasion, a place of popular assembly. The columns in this portion of the temple have the greatest concen-tration of the scenes of the presentation of Maat.3 3 Although the presentation of Maat or the royal nameequated with Maat does occur in the area behind the second court and the upper terrace, it does so far fewertimes than in the public areas.34The Temple of Seti I at Abydos also illustrates the accessibility that the common people had to scenesof the presentation of Maat. As evidenced by the dwl rhtyt nb rebuses in the Second Hypostyle Hall, thenon-priestly classes were allowed into that section of the temple. That area of the temple has a far greaternumber of scenes of the presentation of Maat than any other section of the temple.35The location of the scenes of the presentation of Maat at Karnak Temple also indicates that suchscenes, or those of the presentation of the royal name equated with Maat, were commonly, although not ex-clusively, located in areas of popular access. One might contrast the public area of the great temple, prima-rily the first court and hypostyle hall to the inner areas behind the hypostyle hall.3 6 Only four scenes of thepresentation of Maat are located in the area of the temple to the east of the hypostyle hall (A; B 1, 16-17),and thirteen such scenes occur on the walls of the hypostyle hall itself and upon the porch of the Third Py-lon.\"7 The pillars in the northern half of the hall are incised with nineteen additional scenes of the presenta-tion of Maat.The court of Thutmose I located to the south of the Fifth and Sixth Pylons is decorated with a scene of thepresentation of Maat being offered to a figure of Amun whose face was originally inlaid with some preciousmaterial (D3). Barguet (1962: 113 f.) suggests that this relief lay along the processional route, so although itwas perhaps not as accessible to the common folk as the places of prayer, it was, on occasion, visible.The scenes of the presentation of Maat in the Temple of Ramesses III in the First Court at Karnak arelocated primarily, although not exclusively, on the exterior of the temple where they could easily be seen.The main entry into the temple is decorated with five additional representations and the northern reveal ofthe western door also is incised with the scene.\"9In summary, the vast majority of scenes of the presentation of Maat, or the name as Maat, was locatedin public areas of the temple, in particular, in places of popular supplication. This placement makes it evi-dent that not only the priestly classes but all worshippers were familiar with the iconography of this ritual.A series of scenes of the presentation of Maat appear at Gebel Silsila.40 The location of such scenescould be an association of the fame of Gebel Silsila as the place from which the inundation originated withthe scene of rejuvenation and renewal inherent in Maat.29.

The scene most commonly appears above the descent to the burial chamber (Memeptah [P1], SetiII [P2]), Ramesses III,48 Ramesses VII), or as the second or third scene on the left or right side of the firsthallway.49 The tomb of Ramesses IV shows the ritual in the course of the Book of Gates and the tomb ofRamesses IX uses the motif as a large scale vignette upon the walls of Corridor C (E3).The tombs of Ramesses VI (pl. 19, G4) and Ramesses IX (pl. 20, I1) are decorated with scenes of theking and a god holding a standing figure of Maat,5o but as suggested in Chapter 3: Royal Donors: Anoma-lous Iconography (above), these scenes stress the association of the royal name and Maat and might not de-pict the actual presentation of the image of the goddess.The scenes of the presentation of Maat that occur in the first hallway of certain Ramesside tombs couldbe an allusion to the cycle of Re and to the association of the sun god with his daughter Maat.5' The firstportion of the hallway, which might be decorated with the Litany of Re, is the only area of the sepulcherthat was symbolically struck by the sun's rays, hence the placement of the solar texts. The cycle of the sunis emphasized by the placement of the beginning of the litany on the left, proceeding only as far as the raysof the sun might penetrate, then continuing across the hallway on the right surface, to the right doorjamb. Inthe tombs of Seti II and Merneptah, scenes of the presentation of Maat are intermixed with the text of thelitany, further emphasizing the association of Maat and the solar god. Although only the tombs ofMerneptah and Seti II actually incorporate scenes of the presentation of Maat into the Litany of Re, thetomb of Twosert/Sethnakht (P3), which does not have the litany in its first hall, has the two scenes of thepresentation of the goddess' image at the entrance of the tomb.5 2 The tombs of Merneptah and Ramesses VIhave abbreviations of this iconography on the royal sarcophagus, the shoulder area of which is decoratedwith a small figure of Maat (pl. 10), the crocodile (or snake), and the single-horned animal head that occursabove and below the solar disk which illustrates the Litany of Re.53 This composition is apparently a refer-ence to the sun's symbolic penetration into the darkness of the burial chamber and hence the symbolic asso-ciation of the rebirth of the king with the solar cycle. The sun enters the tomb and is invoked by the litany orby scenes of the presentation of the daughter of Re. The sun's penetration into the darkness is symbolizedby the emblems on the shoulders of the king's sarcophagus, and the rebirth of the king is evoked by the exitof the sun via the Litany of Re texts on the opposite wall of the entry.The depiction of the presentation of Maat over the descent to the burial chamber (Merneptah, Seti II,Ramesses III) is uniformly a double scene, showing the king on the left and right, facing inward to a double41.

See also plate 18 (GI, Cenotaphof Seti I) for a similar scene; see plate 21 (05, ShoshenqIII) for a variation in this iconography. In the tomb ofRamesses IX (pl. 20, 11), the figure of the goddess isflanked by the king's cartouches.51. Placement of the scenes near the entry of the tomb mightalso be related to references to Maat in the first portion ofthe sun hymns that occur in private tombs (Assmann1983a: XX 3.2.1.1.A6).52. A figure of Maat, often seated on a nb- or a hb-sign, is acommon decorative motif for the jambs of the first corridorof the Ramesside tombs (Ramesses 1, Ramesses II,Amunmesse, Ramesses III, Seti II, Siptah) and could be areference, not so much to the vindication of the deceasedking, but to the association of Maat and Re. A figure of thegoddess is also commonly found on jambs of succeedinghallways and lintels over further halls (PM II, 536 (7), 568(5), 763 (12), 764 (22) (23) (28)), perhaps a reference tothe symbolic passage of the sun's rays into the darkness ofthe burial chamber. This association of Maat and the pas-sage of the rays of the sun through darkness can also beseen in the Great Temple at Abu Simbel where the presen-tation of Maat is shown not only on the facade but also onthe lintels of the successive halls leading to the sanctuary(PM VII, 101 (facade), 108 (108-09), 109 (96), I10 (109-10)).53. Elements of this relationship were suggested by EdwinBrock in connection with his work on the Ramesside sar-cophagi.

This scene ismost probably an illustration of the association of Maat with all types of offerings,55 as well as a referenceto the king's piety and worthiness of justification, expressed by his offerings to Osiris.The presentation of a rebus of the royal name occurs only once in the royal tombs,56 and then without adedication inscription that explicitly associates the rebus with Maat.PRIVATE MONUMENTSAlthough the goddess Maat appears in many private tombs,57 the representation of a private individualpresenting her image is extremely rare, and with only one exception, a statue of Nespekashuty (M9), everyexample of the depiction of the ritual with a non-royal donor is from vignettes that accompany mortuary lit-erature (M3-5, 8, 10).58 Two (possibly three) examples of an individual conveying Maat are also funerary:one (pl. 2) is a vignette from the Book of Caverns (Piankoff 1974: 47) and the others are from tomb paint-ings (pl. 1 [= M I]; possibly M2). The only example on jewelry from a non-royal context is a scene of theking presenting Maat that appears on a pectoral carved on a statue of the official Ptahhotep of the Persianperiod.59There is no pattern in the location of the scene in the non-royal use of the ritual. Hornung's (1992:140)observation \"... that such images [of non-royal presentation of Maat] have been documented only in nowinaccessible subterranean Theban burial chambers, which in all likelihood were themselves modeled afterroyal tombs,\" should be qualified because such scenes could occur not only in other parts of the tomb, butalso on stelae (M8) or statues (M9). Specifically regarding location in tombs, the scene could indeed, assuggested by Hornung, appear not only in the burial chamber itself (M3-4), but also in the transverse hall ofthe tomb (M1). In the tomb of Nefermenu (M2), the scene appears in the right wall of the inner room of thetomb; in the Late period tomb of Pedashtar (M10), the representation is located on the left wall of thetomb's inner room.The ritual is not found in predictable alternation with a particular theme. As might be expected from theassociation of Maat and Re, the scene is found near or in conjunction with the solar litany (M2, 5). In asingle tomb (M4), the offering of Maat is adjacent to a scene of a funerary banquet. The examples of theritual from tombs at Deir el-Medina clearly indicate the funerary nature of the scene. In the tomb ofIrynefer (pl. 3, M3), the presentation of Maat is associated with Spells 151 and 166 of the Book of theDead; in the tomb of Amunwahsu (pl. 1, MI), the scene is shown in conjunction with the weighing of theheart (BD chapters 30B, 125). The only private stela (pl. 5, M8) that depicts the presentation of Maat isalso funerary in nature. In that example, the officiant, the priest Harsiese, is dressed as a sem-priest, censingto Re-Horakhty.Each of these examples, with the one stated exception (M9), is from a funerary context, which is instriking contrast to scenes with a royal donor that are attested in the reliefs that decorate temples (with veryfew exceptions; see E3, PI-3).NEW KINGDOM TEMPLESScenes of the presentation of Maat or of the royal name equated with Maat occur on all portions of NewKingdom temples-walls, columns, door jambs, and lintels--in any register of the surfaces' decoration.54.

However, the presentation of Maat comprises Chapter XLII of the Berlin Ser-vice Book (Moret 1902: 138-65), suggesting that the ritual was indeed considered to be a part of the dailyoffering service, despite the fact that the ritual does not appear in the relief record of that service. Unfortu-nately, the Berlin Papyrus, the only pre-Ptolemaic liturgy for the presentation of Maat, provides very littleinformation about the sequence of the ritual in the context of the daily offering service except that the ritefollowed the presentation of the wdut-eye.69On the basis of scenes at Edfu, Ibrahim states that the presentation of Maat was a component of thecoronation ceremony.70 However, the reliefs from the pre-Ptolemaic temples do not clearly confirm nor dis-prove Ibrahim's suggestion because scenes of the presentation of Maat occur only inconsistently in thesame context as coronation scenes.7' The presentation of Maat also occurs adjacent to other types of scenesthat are intimately related to the sense of royal legitimacy, such as the purification of the king,7 2scenes of61.

However, the presentationof Maat does occur near the scenes that make up the\"ritual of Amunophis\" on the east wall (north half) of theHypostyle Hall at Karnak (OIP 106, pl. 213) and atMedinet Habu (MH IV, pls. 244M, 2468).

Two scenes of Ramesses II, one on the por-tico of the Temple of Seti I at Abydos (PM VI, 3 (36)) and the other on the portico of the Temple of Seti I atGourna (B 11), also associate the presentation of Maat with finishing and embellishing the monuments ofhis predecessor, an act that is intimately associated with royal legitimacy. In both scenes, Ramesses appearswith Seti I, whose presence strengthens his succession.The possible association of the presentation of Maat with the Opet festival is attested by two series ofscenes, both of which are carved on the hull of the Userhat barge in the Opet procession. The first (C3), inthe Colonnade Hall of Luxor Temple, dates to the time of Tutankhamun; the second (Cl), on the east faceof the Third Pylon (north half) at Karnak, is attributed to Horemheb (Murnane 1979: 11-27).

Not only are there a different number of vignettes in each, but the sequence of theindividual ritual scenes also does not correspond, suggesting that the scenes on the barges do not represent aset sequence of rituals connected with the Opet procession, but rather a record of more random ritual acts.Since the offering of Maat does occur in both sequences, it is quite possible that the ritual was a portion ofthe cult actions associated with the Opet festival.77 What significance the ritual could have had within thefestival is more difficult to deduce. Since Luxor Temple has been shown to be associated with the cult ofthe royal ka and with the king's legitimacy, it is curious that there are no Eighteenth Dynasty scenes of thepresentation of Maat among the many other offering scenes within the vestibule of Luxor Temple.78Consid-(purification), 177A (presenting Maat), 1778 (receivingjubilees).73.

In asimilar vein, the inclusion of the ritual in the Berlin Service Book, yet its omission from the related reliefs inthe Hypostyle Hall at Karnak, warns against assuming that the rite was not a part of a particular ritual be-cause it is not portrayed on the temple walls.Unfortunately, the two sequences of rituals upon the Opet barges are the only unaltered scenes of thepresentation of Maat that occur in a set sequence from the Eighteenth Dynasty.RAMESSIDE PERIOD SEQUENCES AND PATTERNSCertain sequences can be, or have been, documented for scenes of the presentation of Maat during theRamesside period.M 't / nw-VESSELSThe most common sequence into which Maat enters is its juxtaposition with the offering of nw-ves-sels,80 which is seen in the tombs of Memeptah (PI) and Seti II (P2), in which the king alternately offersMaat and nw-vessels over the descent to the burial chamber. Maat and nw-vessels are often juxtaposed inthe Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu.8' This association between the two offerings was so closethat there are examples of the conflation of the offerings. On the exterior of the Eighteenth Dynasty templeat Medinet Habu (P4; decorated by Ramesses III), the king presents nw, although the dedication clearlyreads di M''t n itf \"presenting Maat to his father.\" A similar situation is encountered in the Great Templewhere Ramesses III presents an offering, now lost; although traces suggest that the relief showed nw-ves-sels (P5). The original dedication, hnk M't ... \"presenting Maat,\" was recarved to hInk lip ... \"presentingwine.\" This association of the two offerings is also seen in the first corridor of the tomb of Twosert/Sethnakht where a scene was recarved to alter it from the queen presenting nw, to a scene of her successor(Sethnakht) presenting Maat (P3). This M?'t / nw-vessel sequence is also frequently seen on the frames oftemple doorways.82In the southern chapel at the Great Temple at Abu Simbel, a double scene depicts the king presentingnw-vessels (right) and the rebus of his prenomen (left) (Curto 1965, pl. 199), thereby stressing the associa-tion of the presentation of the prenomen and Maat.83UPPER / LOWER REGISTERThe columns in the Second Court at Medinet Habu are decorated with scenes of the presentation ofMaat in the uppermost and lowermost of three registers, but never in the middle register.8 4These columnsand outer faces of his sanctuary: PM II, 324-25 (143) 11.5;325 (144) 1.6; 325 (149) 3.

Sc, 9c, 14b.As analyzed by Bell 1985a: 251-94.This has been commented on by Osing ( 1977: 66-69), whoextends this sequence to the offering of wine, Maat, in-cense/libation, and food. He specifically mentions theMW't / nw-vessel association in his reference to the GerfHussein Temple of Ramesses 11 (Osing 1977: 67, n. 3).See also Traunecker, La Saout, and Masson 1981: 147 forthe association of nw-vessels and M't.

This reconstruction is based upon the handgestures of the king and parallel appearances of the ritual in the first (lowest) register of the north half ofthe west wall of the Hypostyle Hall of Karnak\"8 and the south side of the eastern half of the First Pylon atLuxor Temple (Kuentz 1971: 7, pl. 8). Several objections can be cited in this proposed sequence. First, thehand gesture, which Osing suggests is restricted to the offering of white bread and Maat, is in fact employedfor a variety of objects,89 and therefore the scene might not be the offering of Maat. Secondly, although thescene of the presentation of Maat certainly does occur as the first scene in the lowest register of the Hypo-style Hall and Luxor Temple, there are no other examples of this perhaps coincidental pattern with which tobolster the suggested sequence. Considering the great number of scenes of the presentation of Maat and thewide variety of their locations, it seems unlikely that the scenes cited by Osing make up a deliberate or sig-nificant pattern.MAAT / WINE / INCENSE AND LIBATION / FOODOsing (1977: 66-69) suggests that Maat, wine, incense/libation, and food offerings comprise a set pat-tern of wall decoration in certain temples. As evidence, he cites temple reliefs dating from the Ramessideto the Ptolemaic periods.\" The scenes that make up Osing's sequence occur within several different regis-ters, and in one example might be divided by a larger scale offering scene.9' In another example, the se-quence makes up the entire decorative scheme of a small room,92 which does seem to reinforce the unity ofthe scenes. However, it is unclear that Osing's sequence is a deliberate pattern. Since the items that makeup the grouping are among the more common offerings, it might be only coincidental that these four types ofscenes are shown in proximity to each other in the eight examples upon which Osing bases the sequence.The entire corpus of offering scenes is enormous, and it is very likely that there will be correspondencesthat could, in fact, be accidental and thus of no real significance. For example, the presentation of Maat or arebus of the royal name is very commonly found next to the presentation of flowers without the other twoelements of Osing's proposed sequence.93 Yet flowers and Maat, respectively, are found in sequence with agreat number of other objects. In essence, the significance of such sequences cannot be evaluated in the ab-sence of more compelling evidence that these items indeed comprise a deliberate scheme with a ritual func-tion. Attempting to determine sequences of very common offerings in temple reliefs can be likened to nu-merology-with enough material and enough variation in the material, patterns can be established, be theycoincidental or deliberate. Such coincidental ordering could explain Osing's (1977: 69) variant of the fourpart sequence wherein he substitutes cloth for the wine element, yet suggests that this new four part se-quence is possibly comparable. Proceeding in this manner, with the incredibly large corpus of offeringscenes available for study, one can easily establish a non-exclusive relationship between any two, three, orfour offerings, although their ordering could, in fact, be coincidental.85.

The representa-tion of the presentation of Maat is also, to a less frequent degree, found upon ostraca and jewelry in theroyal Ramesside tombs.The scene is prominently and frequently located in public areas of temples, and less frequently in theareas wherein the common man was not allowed. The representation of the ritual in places of popular wor-ship and petition suggests that the common man was well aware of the iconography of the ritual and that theritual was relevant to religion in general. This relevance is confirmed by the existence of examples of thepresentation of Maat in which a non-royal individual acts as the donor (class M). In contrast to the royalscenes, with only one possible exception, all such examples with non-royal donors are from tombs, funerarypapyri, or funerary stelae. Those from tombs do not occur in any discernible pattern in relation to other tombdecoration or architectural features. The one possible exception to the funerary origins of the examples ofthe presentation of Maat on the part of a non-royal donor is the statue of Nespekashuty (M9). This statuewas recovered from the Karnak Cachette and thus was presumably from the hypostyle hall of that temple.The motif upon the front of the statue could be a reflection of the role of Nespekashuty as a prophet of Maat(hm ntr n M?'t; Legrain 1914: 80j).The scenes that portray the king as donor of Maat do not occur in any predictable sequence with othertypes of offerings. Although one can identify sequences such as upper/lower register on columns or thescene's association with other representations related to royal legitimacy, the presentation of Maat or thename does not occur exclusively in these locations or contexts. The presentation of Maat appears to be as-sociated with the presentation of wine-not only does it occur with some regularity in the same context, butit is also often juxtaposed to it in double offering scenes. This association is also attested by rare textual ref-erences in which one offering is referred to by the other's designation (PI-5).Why is it so difficult to establish more certain ordering and sequence for scenes of the presentation ofMaat or the royal name? One major consideration is our imperfect understanding of the details of templeritual and the relationship of the presentation of Maat to the rituals enacted in the temple.94 This lack of un-derstanding, exacerbated by the almost complete lack of relevant liturgical texts, clouds an understandingof how this ritual, and many other rituals, functioned in temple settings. The references to the ritual that ap-pear in the Berlin Service Book and in the Late period reliefs at Edfu, as well as its depiction in conjunctionwith rituals associated with the Opet festival (Cl, 3), suggest that the rite was one of the standard ritualsand that it was actually performed in the temple, yet this assumption cannot be confirmed and elaboratedupon on the basis of New Kingdom records.The lack of discernible pattern in the scenes might also be explained by proposing that there simply isno overall scheme in the arrangement of temple reliefs. There are, however, several strong argumentsagainst this suggestion. It is difficult to believe that the ancient Egyptians would have decorated the walls oftheir temples with a random patterning of ritual scenes; such randomness would be in marked contrast to thedecorative schemes of funerary structures.95 Although the scenes might not be an accurate record of the ritu-als that were conducted in a particular chamber, it is unthinkable that the scenes did not have a ritual func-tion, whether as a record of actual or symbolic rites or as symbols of the king's piety. Further, the studies ofNelson, Bell, Barta, Altenmiller, Osing, Helck, and others have demonstrated that sequences for certainportions of temples can be documented.9Yet another explanation for the apparent vagueness of the sequence of the scenes could lie in our as-sumptions about the significance of the ritual. One might argue that if this type of offering ritual were of pri-mary importance, as suggested by Arnold (1962: 44, no. 1) and Bleeker (1973: 80), it would perhaps have94.

So, too, thepossible relative lack of importance of the presentation of Maat might be argued from the almost completelack of liturgical texts that refer to the rite. However, the great number of depictions of the ritual argues forthe importance of the rite.In summary, although the presentation of Maat does not occur in a definite and predictable patternamong other themes of ritual offering in the New Kingdom temples, this does not in any way indicate thatthe ritual is insignificant. The sheer number of examples of the scene, its placement in public as well as pri-vate areas of the temples, and its association with expressions of legitimacy such as scenes of coronation,purification, and the king being escorted into the presence of the gods suggest that it had a special relevanceto the concept of royal legitimacy and the proclamation of that legitimacy. This sense is inherent in the of-fering of Maat and also in the ritual of the presentation of the name equated with Maat. In the former, theking presents the image of the goddess who represents the principles upon which the state is governed andthe perfect state of the world at the time of its creation. In the latter ritual, with few exceptions,97 the kingpresents his prenomen, the name that he assumed at his accession to the throne, which is the name by whichhe, as pharaoh, is known. Hence he and his name are Maat and worthy of ruling the Two Lands. The incor-poration of Maat into the majority of the titularies of the Ramesside kings further emphasizes the associa-tion of the name ritual with royal legitimacy.98The expression of legitimacy inherent in the ritual of the offering of the rebus of the royal name associ-ated with Maat is also indicated by the near absence of this particular scene in the royal tombs.99 The omis-sion of the rebus associated with Maat should be weighed against scenes that show the elevation of theroyal name (pl. 20, I1), or the elevation of a rebus incorporating Maat (GI, 4-5),H\" but which are neverthrough the dedication equated with the presentation of Maat. The use of one form of the ritual over theother suggests that the theme of the presentation of the name as Maat was not considered to be so relevantin the context of royal tomb decoration.0' Since the standard decorative motifs that adorn the royalRamesside tombs stress the king's association with the sun and his attainment of a blessed afterlife, theritual of the presentation of the name, which emphasizes the king's legitimacy as a living king, was consid-ered to be less appropriate in such a context. The presentation of Maat, however, is employed in the royaltombs because rather than stressing the status of the living king (his legitimacy while upon earth), the offer-ing of Maat is associated with themes that are appropriate to the funerary beliefs expressed in the tombs.These themes include Maat's association with the Litany of Re'0 2 and the juxtaposition of representations ofthe offering of Maat and nw-vessels which expresses the idea that other offerings are subsumed in Maatand that Maat is the \"food of the gods.\"10397. For exceptions, see class H.98. Only the titularies of Seti II, Siptah, Sethnakht, andRamesses IX lack references to Maat.99. A single known exception is in the tomb of Ramesses VI(Piankoff 1954, pl. 138a). This scene lacks a dedicationthat directly equates the rebus with Maat. However, theiconography of this scene is directly inspired by thosescenes which equate the rebus with Maat in contrast tothose which show the elevation of the name (G 1,4-5).100. GI (Cenotaph of Seti I at Abydos) is included in this listbecause of the mortuary nature of that structure.101. The funerary temples could be grouped with the festivaltemples due to their shared accessibility to the public, theirrole as a place for popular worship, and their use duringthe lifetime of the king. For such features of these struc-tures, see Chapter I and Occurrences on Monuments(above). This accessibility is in contrast to the royal tombsthat have a function which relates only to the king and theaffirmation of his afterlife and which were presumably in-accessible after the burial was deposited. For the questionof access into the royal tombs of the Nineteenth and Twen-tieth Dynasties, see Thomas 1966: 274.102. P2-3. The two scenes of the presentation of Maat byRamesses IV on the solar bark also express the Maat/Reassociation (PM 1/2, 499 (14) (15)). The scene actuallyappears on the small side walls to the right and left of theentry to the chamber. These side walls do not have sepa-rate numbers in PM.103. PI-2.

These inscriptions occur with only minor variations throughout the period that thepresentation of Maat was a part of the religious iconography. Scenes from the Amarna period, however, donot have dedication inscriptions nor a recitation from the normally mute Aton.THE DEDICATIONThe dedication normally takes the form: verb + Maat + dative n + epithets of recipient + recipient'sname + irfd nbi (or variant) formula. In many cases, there are variations in this stereotyped scheme, mostcommonly the omission of the recipient's epithets or variations in, or omission of, the Irfdi nb or dl 'nbformulas.THE VERBThe earliest references to the ritual of the offering of Maat employ the verbs s'r,2 in,3 or substitute anon-verbal phrase, i.e., preposition hr or hr + noun.4 Although all three early forms continued to be associ-ated with the presentation of Maat in texts,5 the offering formulas that accompany representations of thepresentation of Maat down to the Ptolemaic period6 show (with few exceptions) the use of the verbs hnk orhnk m and forms of rdl (di, dit, rdlt).7 S'r and hnk are found in alternation in several texts that are not asso-ciated with offering scenes,8 prompting Anthes (1952: 13) to speculate whether the verbs denoted two dis-tinct rituals. The main distinction in the terms apparently is the restriction of s'r to literary allusions to theelevation of Maat.9 Perhaps the clearest differentiation is that s'r means \"to cause to ascend\" and hnk ismore strictly \"to present\" in the context of offering scenes. Lichtheim (1992: 36) suggests that s'r in thenon-royal context indicates that \"the royal official's reporting to the king on the responsible performance of1.

Emphasizing this distinction, s'r is not used in a context of dedication followed by divinerecitation, confirming Anthes' suggestion that the verbs denote different rituals. Therefore, both hnk and(r)di denote the actual transfer of Maat from donor to recipient, while s'r describes the physical elevationof the goddess' image.Anthes' comment that hnk does not appear with the presentation of Maat before the Amarna period iscountered by a pedestal of Amunhotep III (A2) and by a Thutmoside scene in the Festival Hall (Al), whichalthough recarved under Alexander exhibits the writing hnk.'0In the dedication inscriptions, hnk or hnk m is the favored form, with forms of rdi serving as a variant(see table 3). The similarities in orthography shared by these two verbs lead to some confusion concerningwhich verb is actually employed, especially when the verbs are written in their simplest and most commonforms: Dt or &.n (di) and a.... (hnk). This is a particular problem in damaged scenes, in which theepigrapher had to differentiate between two very similar forms.\" This problem of distinguishing di fromhnk is alleviated when the latter verb is followed by the preposition m or when the verb is written phoneti-cally.'2 The use of the preposition, however, is irregular,'3 and only when it is employed can one distinguishbetween the two verbs in damaged or questionable scenes. An examination of a large corpus of scenes thatwere executed during a relatively short period of time, such as those at Medinet Habu, shows how inconsis-tent is the use of m after hnk. Of the sixty-eight scenes of the presentation of Maat in the Temple ofRamesses III, twenty-eight examples employ hnk alone and twenty-two hnk m.4 These examples are scat-tered throughout the temple. Neither verb is associated with a particular divine recipient.The possible confusion of hnk and di poses an additional difficulty when trying to determine if one formis associated with the earliest representations of the presentation of Maat. The scenes from Thutmose IIIhave been recut. However, in their present form they are divided in their use of di' (BI), the infinitive rdit(B2), and hnk (Al).5 Although there are very few scenes from which to draw conclusions, the Thutmosideoffering rituals reflect the variation of association of verb and object that is seen in other offering scenes aswell.Hnk (m) is not associated exclusively with Maat presentation scenes. It is used in offering scenes fromthe Old Kingdom (Moussa and Altenmuiller 1977: 51, pl. 11, scene 2.4), and it is used in connection with thededication of wine,16 honey,\"7 bread,\" and a number of other offerings.\"9 In contrast, scenes upon the Enclo-sure Wall at Karnak display an exceptionally close association between verb and object. There, .ink occurs10. See comments (below) concerning the confusion in or-thography of rd( and hnk. For the omission of the particlem when the verb hnk is used to narrate the presentation ofunguent or oil, see Meeks 1977: 251. But see Osing 1977,22 (2.12), pl. 16, for hnk m m t. The m could be the firstradical of the noun m?'t.11. See, for example, MH V, pl. 275C (top), and MH VII, pl.555B, for the phrase dim.

The verb isclearly not \"rdjl.t\" because the verb lacks the r as well asthe final -t. That the verb is hnk is shown clearly inStadelmann 1988, pl. 79. As shown in table 3, the verb hnkwas with few exceptions employed for such scenes in thereign of Seti.12. See B 18 for the writing a.

In the Appendix: Classification of Scenes, there are twenty-six occurrences of a form ofrdi. Of those examples, slightly over one half, a very small proportion of the entire corpus of Maat presenta-tion scenes, exhibit the final -t of the infinitive.2 4 As with the alternation of hnk m and hnk, the use of thefully written infinitive form is not restricted to a particular chronological period or location.This variation in the verb associated with a specific offering is seen with other rituals as well. For ex-ample, irt sntr \"making thurification\" alternates with !ink sntr in similar reliefs at the Temple of Seti I atGourna (Osing 1977, pls. 15, 17), just as dit M.?'t and nk M?'t are used alongside each other in the tomb ofRamesses III (B18) and hnk m Mi't25 appears as the dedication of the Nauri Decree's lunette (A6) whilethe banner above the king's head is rdit M?'t. This flexibility suggests that the ancient Egyptians considerednk and (r)dit to be synonymous when used in offering scenes. Both verbs are well attested in offering for-mulas, and the suggestion that hlnk alone is the normal form in such cases is without foundation (Meeks1977: 251). A scene of the offering of Maat in the Great Temple at Abu Simbel underscores the apparentlyinterchangeable nature of the verbs ink and di because there the ritual is accompanied by the dedicationrdit !nk nm M?'t n it.f (Desroches-Nobelcourt et al. 1956: 11 [YI ld]).The form .(rdi) is never employed in the offering of Maat (or of the royal name equated withMaat), perhaps because it did not reflect the form of the infinitive that was considered to be appropriate inthis context, while rdit, dit, and hnk all morphologically are infinitive forms. The verb irt is used in the dedi-cation of Maat once in the Temple of Ramesses II at Beit el-Wali where it appears as irt Mi't Ir n.fm di'nh.26 In the southern chapel at Abu Simbel, the dedication for the presentation of the goddesses' image is,27 which seems to be a conflation of the two more common verbal forms. A single scene of the pre-sentation of Maat in the tomb of Shoshenq III at Tanis (pl. 17, B29) employs mn n.k (4) \"take to yourself[Maat],\" which is otherwise unattested in this context and therefore could be a corruption of the phoneticwriting of hnk ( ) \"I have brought to you.\"28The phrase in.n.(i) n.k M?'t is only rarely encountered in textual references (R5, 7) to the offering ofMaat.29 Its use in the tomb of Nebwenenef (N3) where Thoth holds Maat (Seele 1959, pl. 17) again illus-trates the flexibility in vocabulary because the same scene appears in the nearby tomb of Tjaynefer (N2)with the inscription di.n(.J) n.k M?'t.20.

The offering of ointment occurs four addi-tional times on the Enclosure Wall, paired with irt (ibid.,pls. 15, 19, 25, 55).21.

The fullest phonetic writing -is rarely used.30 The short or long form of the name is not restrictedto certain time periods or specific monuments,31 nor does it appear have more than a casual association withthe form of the verb that precedes it.32 The short version of the name might not have been considered to bevery distinct from the longer writing because the image of Maat that the king presents to the deity could beconstrued as serving for the determinative (Fischer 1977: 3-4).The short form of the name is written with or without the final -t. Again, this writing is inconsistent. AtMedinet Habu, thirteen examples do not express the feminine -t, eight do.33 In the Court and First HypostyleHall at the Temple of Khonsu, there is a marked preference for expressing the feminine ending (8 to 1).This tendency is shared by the God's Wives of Amun, who with one exception (KI) write Maat in the ab-breviated form with the feminine -t (K2, 4--6).THE RECIPIENTA great majority of the scenes of the presentation of Maat portray the officiant offering to more thanone god. Each god in the scene has his own recitation in the form of a short inscription; however, the dedica-tion, with its single address (n nb.s, n it.s, etc.) makes it evident that only the god immediately facing theofficiant is a direct recipient of the offering.34 The other divine participants are hereafter referred to as \"at-tendants.\" 35RECIPIENT'S EPITHETSThere is a decided preference for the epithets it + 3rd person suffix \"his/her father\" or nb + 3rd personfeminine suffix \"her lord.\"36 The variation in the gender of suffix pronouns and their association with maleor female recipients indicate that there was a flexibility in the understanding of to whom the epithets re-ferred. These variations include:Category 1. Epithet it.f \"his father\" with male donor and recipient (Al, 5-6, 11-12, 14-28, 31, 34; BI(twice), 10, 18 (twice), 19-20, 30; El, 4; FI, 5-6, 11-13, 19-20, 22; HI; 05, 7; P4-5) indicatesthat the suffix must refer to the donor; therefore, this form of the epithet indicates that the donoris the \"son\" of the recipient. These examples are attested throughout the entire history of therepresentation of the presentation of Maat.Category 2. Epithet It.s \"her father\" with female donor and male recipient (KI, 4, 7-8; RIO) indicates thatthe suffix s refers to either the female donor or to Maat. Therefore, the recipient of the offeringcould be considered to be either the father of the donor or the father of Maat. These examplesare restricted to the God's Wives of the Third Intermediate Period.Category 3. Epithets nb.s \"her lord/possessor\" (A3, 7, 29, 33; B3, 6; F2, 21) or it.s \"her father\" (Al0)31 witha male donor and recipient indicate that the s suffix refers to Maat; therefore, the deity who re-ceives Maat is the possessor (nb) of the qualities of Maat or the father (it) of Maat. These ex-amples are attested in the Eighteenth Dynasty (B3) as well as in the Ramesside period.30. See B3 (Amunhotep 111), LI (Osorkon), and 830 (Shebit-ku). The simplest writing is found on B4 and MH V, pl.336.31. See, for example, the columns in the first court at MedinetHabu where the two forms of the name appear on the samecolumn (MH VI, pls. 374B2; 374D1; 375A2, long; 376B2;397D, long form).32. For example, at Medinet Habu, the full writing of thename follows .nk nine times, link m seventeen times, andanother form of rdl twice; the short writing is associatedwith hnk sixteen times, lnk m three times, and anotherform of rdt three times. The five scenes of the presentationof Maat on the High Gate all associate the full writings ofthe goddess' name with hnk m (MR VIII, pls. 617B-C;618A, E; 623E).33. MH V, pl. 344A, is questionable and is not included amongthe eight examples.34. A single example of what appears to be a plural form of ad-dress appears in Abydos (Frankfort 1933, pl. 15: hnk M 't nnbw MIt). However, since Edel (1955/64, §§214, 243aa)gives examples of nbw as the writing of the singular, andsince this example is unique, nb(w) could be the singular.35. This is suggested by the label used by the Epigraphic Sur-vey for offering scenes: \"presenting x to y in the presenceof z,\" specifying that the attendants are only witnesses tothe offering.36. GEG3 §§ 115, 115A. Note also that a god can bear morethan one epithet; see F19 (Ramesses V) for hnk MI't n nbMi't n it.f.37. See also B7 for the epithet where It is restored.52oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"INSCRIPTIONSCategory 4. Epithet nb Mt \"lord/possessor of Maat\" (A4, 8-9, 13-16, 22-24, 30, 32; BS, 9, 13, 22; F7, 10,19; K2-3, 6; LI) is unambiguous in indicating that the recipient is the possessor of the qualitiesof the goddess Maat.38Category 5. The epithet mwt.f\"his mother\" (F8; H2) occurs where the kings, Ramesses II and IV respec-tively, present their prenomen, equated with Maat, to a goddess (Mut and Amunet). Here, therecipient is considered to be the mother of the donor.This range of epithets expresses three main relationships:1. A filial relationship between the donor and recipient (categories 1, 2, 5, and the t.s variation of 3).2. A filial relationship between the deity Maat and the recipient deity (nb.s variation of category 3).3. A relationship between Maat the rest of the gods (category 4).It is apparent that within the context of the presentation of Maat, the most common association ex-pressed by the donation epithets is the filial relationship between the recipient and the donor. It is not unex-pected, considering the nature of the offering scene, that the donor, most commonly the king, is regarded asthe offspring of the gods. This same relationship is expressed in categories 2, 3, and 5, wherein the donor isplaced in a father-son39 or a mother-son relationship with the deity to whom the offering is made. The rela-tionship is not one of superior-inferior but rather that of parent to offspring.This expression of filial relationship is also extended directly to Maat in the rare it.s \"her father\" ex-ample of epithet category 3, in which Maat herself is called the offspring of the recipient. However, consid-ering that there is only one example of this epithet, it is possible that this association of Maat as the off-spring of the recipient is a minor one, or that this one example is an error.The filial relationship expressed in the scenes from the time of the God's Wives (class K, epithet cat-egory 2: it.s \"her father\" with the female donor and male recipient) has at least two possible interpretations.One is, similar to the rare variation (it.s \"her father\" with male donor and recipient) of category 3, thatMaat is considered to be the daughter of the divine recipient. The other, preferable interpretation is that therelationship expressed refers to the God's Wife as the daughter of the divine recipient. The first translation,namely Maat being the daughter of the recipient, is attested only in the rare variation of category 3 (It.s\"her father\" with male donor and recipient). The second interpretation is more plausible because of the un-ambiguous emphasis put upon the analogous father-son relationship expressed in categories 1, 2, and 5,which seems to be the dominant pattern of the relationship. This conclusion is confirmed by the inscriptionupon a statue of Karomama (RIO0), in which di M~'t n it.s \"presenting Maat to her father\" is followed by thename of the woman's actual human father, Amunemopet (Jacquet-Gordon 1967: 87). Here, it is clear thatthe father-daughter relationship refers to the donor and recipient rather than to Maat. This emphasis on thedual nature of the relationship, the donor and recipient, is expressed in other ways in the context of the pre-sentation of Maat (see Chapter 4, above).The general sense of a filial relationship in the offering is not restricted to certain historical periods orparticular rulers; however, it is very common in the Ramesside period inscriptions that accompany the pre-sentation of Maat.Category 4 (nb M31t \"lord/possessor of Maat\") makes no judgment about the relative status of the do-nor and recipient. This phrase is conventionally translated as either \"the lord of Maat\" or \"the possessor of(the qualities of) Maat.\" The use of the epithet in the context of the presentation of Maat suggests that thesecond interpretation is to be preferred. A basic objection to the translation \"the lord of Maat\" is the funda-mental question whether a god (or a king) can be the lord of (i.e., superior to) Maat. The use of the epithetduring the Old Kingdom,4o especially as it was applied to Snefru,41 strongly suggests that the phrase nb Mi'tshould be rendered as \"possessor of the qualities of Maat\" rather than \"lord of Maat\" because it would beinconceivable for a king to consider his own status to be above that of the goddess.38.

Each is affected by the abstract concepts ofMaat, yet none rules over her. The entire sphere of gods possess qualities of Maat as an indication of theirbasic morality.It is noteworthy that the expression nbf \"his lord\"4 3 does not occur in the epithets related to the presen-tation of Maat because the use of such an epithet would change the donor-recipient relationship expressedin categories 1-4 from that of father or mother to son, to that of a lord and presumably non-lord, namelythat of superior to inferior. This type of unequal relationship is clearly avoided in the context of this ritualthat stresses the ability of the king to interact with the gods.In the iconography and inscriptions in the Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu, the following gods,as recipients of Maat, receive the epithet nb MW't: Amun/Amun-Re and Ptah (four occurrences each),44Khonsu (twice),45 and Thoth, Ptah-Sokar, Re-Horakhty, Osiris, and Montu (once each).46 These gods re-ceive other epithets, most commonly, t.f \"his father\" in other scenes of the presentation of Maat in thesame temple.47The doorway of the chapel of Seti I in the Inner Osiris Hall of the Temple of Seti I at Abydos (A3-4)presents an intriguing example of how subtle is the differentiation in use of the epithets. Upon first exami-nation, the decoration of the left and right side of the doorway seems to be identical: Seti presents Maat toOsiris. The king and god's stance, crowns, and the offering table between the donor and recipient are identi-cal with the exception of the dedication inscriptions. To the right (A3), the king dedicates Mt n nb.s, to theleft (A4), he dedicates M?'t n nb M?'t. To the right (A3) the pectoral of Osiris is decorated with figures ofOsiris and Maat flanking a rebus of the king's name. Here, the s suffix of the epithet refers to the tiny Maatfigurine in the pectoral, and as in category I of epithets, it means that the recipient, Osiris, is considered tobe the possessor of the qualities of Maat.The pectoral on the Osiris figure to the left (A4) is decorated with figures of Osiris and Ptah, seated be-tween a rebus. The epithet nb M?'t is well attested for Ptah,\"4 who is depicted on the pectoral; Ptah is pos-sessor of the qualities of Maat. In this complex set of scenes, the same sense of the recipient being associ-ated with Maat is expressed by two different epithets.RECIPIENT'S NAMEThe omission of the recipient's name is very rare in the presentation scenes. When it is omitted, therecipient's epithet such as nb MW't, stands in its place. The reversal of the god's name is irregular but notuncommon, not only in the Maat presentation scenes,49 but also in other types of contemporary offeringscenes.5042. Christophe 1950: 139. See Osing 1977: 48, no. 93, for thestatement that the title nb Mrt occurs at Gourna only inconjunction with the offering of Maat to Amun.

Their association with the act of offering is suggested by the fact that they are employedonly rarely in scenes wherein offering is not depicted. Examples of non-offering compositions in which theformula is employed include scenes of the pharaoh before a procession, performing the Opfertanz, a sceneof adoration, and Ramesside scenes of ritual harvest.61 The formula also appears on some doorframes.6 2The most common use of the irf di 'nI type formula in a context other than offering is as the last phrase inthe irfnm mnwf n i'f dedication.63DEVELOPMENT OF THE irf di 'nt FORMULAThe phrase ir-fdX 'nht conventionally translated \"he makes given life\" appears first in the inscriptions ofthe dedication of offerings of the Middle Kingdom.'M The lrf di 'iif formula is of special interest because ofthe apparent change in the relationship of the verb 1r to the phrase di nit and whether the donor or the re-cipient is the subject of ir. The latter question can be tested by the agreement of the gender of the donor andrecipient in regard to the suffix that follows the verb. Unfortunately, the diagnostic examples, those whichshow a female donor offering to a male recipient, all date to two compact time periods (Hatshepsut and theGod's Wives of the Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth Dynasties ).6-1 Scenes that show a male donor offering toa female recipient before the time of Ramnesses 1ll, narrated by the inscription irf di 'n t, are not common.66Fisher suggests that the orientation of the hieroglyphs of the formula can also provide information about themeaning of the phrase .6 7 His general premise is that the signs are oriented in accordance with the orienta-tion of the figure to whom they refer. Hence, if the formula is in the same orientation as the divine recipient,the verb has special relevance to the god.51.

The relationship of thevarious phrases is most clearly indicated by Eighteenth Dynasty scenes in which they appear alternately, al-though they apparently fulfill the same function. On the left side of a relief from Kummeh, Thutmose II of-fers wine to Khnum, while on the right Thutmose III performs the Opfertanz before Hathor.69 The dedica-tion of Thutmose II is followed by the phrase r.f nf di n, that of Thutmose III by irf di nh. In a similarfashion, irfd Cnb and di 'nb directly follow the name or epithet of the god to whom the offering is made onthe lunette of a stela of Amunhotep III (B3). The employment of three forms of the irf di nh in the samecontext supports Fischer's assumption that the phrases, despite their varying components and grammaticalstructure, have a similar function and theological content.70Nims (1975: 76; 1976: 173) and Fischer's conclusion that the donor is the subject of the verb ir is, withthe two exceptions noted below, confirmed by the reliefs of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The twelve examplesof the formula from the Chapelle Rouge, which depict the queen offering to male deities and use thephrase, employ the form Ir.s di ~'nn, indicating that the donor is the subject of the verb tr. Although thename of the god to whom the offering is made is subject to reversal, the orientation of formula itself agreeswith the donor.The reliefs at Deir el-Bahari also indicate that the donor is the subject of the verb 1tr, because as withthe materials from the Chapelle Rouge, the scenes of the queen offering to a male deity are accompaniedby the formula ir.s di Cn7' and scenes of a male donor offering to a female deity employ the phrase irffdi'nt.7 As on the Chapelle Rouge, there are no examples of the reversal of the hieroglyphs that make up theformula.Two exceptional examples from Deir el-Bahari that use ir.s di nh with a male donor and male recipi-ent are thought to be the result of recarving73 and thus might have originally depicted the queen as theofficiant. However, neither scene appears to have been restored. Since in neither Thutmose scene can thesubject of the verb refer to the recipient or to the donor, the suffix must honorifically refer to the queen forwhom the temple was constructed.74A few other diagnostic scenes can be cited from the later Eighteenth Dynasty. A stela of Thutmose IIIfrom Serabit el-Khadim (LD III, pl. 29a) that depicts the king offering to Hathor bears the phrase irfdi &nt,indicating that the donor was the subject of the verb, which is also documented by a single example fromthe reign of Amunhotep III that depicts the king offering to Nekhbet with the formula ir.f dl 'nh mi Rm dt(LD III, pl. 80c). There is one example of the reversal of the phrase in the time of Amunhotep III.7 How-ever, the reversal of the entire phrase in that scene is probably due to its orientation to the deifiedAmunhotep III who acts as the recipient of the offering. The near absence of reversals of the phrase76 fur-ther supports the conclusion that in the Eighteenth Dynasty the subject of ir is the donor.The verb's relationship to the donor rather than to the recipient in the Eighteenth Dynasty is likewisesupported by the iconography of the offering scenes.

Nims (1975: 76) proposes that \"Through thereign of Ramesses II the actor is the ruler ... \" and that in the later scenes, the meaning has changed to \"sothat the deity may grant (to the ruler) 'Given-Life.'\" The determination of the period in which this changeoccurred is based upon certain scenes that were recopied from the Ramesseum for use in the Great Templeat Medinet Habu. As Nims points out, the only change in the earlier and later copies of the scenes is that thesuffix pronouns are modified to agree with the gender of the recipient of the offering. Fischer agrees withNims that the \"new interpretation,\" i.e., that the subject of Ir is the deity, is first consistently displayed in thereliefs at Medinet Habu.Although we can definitely say that the change is first manifested in the reliefs at Medinet Habu, itseems likely that the interpretation predates the period when it is used so uniformly and that a period ofgradual reappraisal of the formula preceded the period of Ramesses III. Certain elements of this reinterpre-tation can indeed be traced in the late Eighteenth and especially in the Nineteenth Dynasties.One might view the occasional reversals of the formula as the first indication that the Irf dl nb wasgradually being reinterpreted. Although Fischer (1977: 98, fig. 99) cites a few scattered examples from theMiddle Kingdom and Eighteenth Dynasty, the reversal became fairly frequent in the Nineteenth Dynasty.The apparent \"contradictions\" in the meaning of the formula suggest that the iconographic expression of itdid not, in the time of Seti I, express its current meaning, which might explain the variation in formulas en-countered in the Hypostyle Hall at Karnak. There, tr.s di n6 follows the dedication of an offering toSekhmet (OIP 106, pl. 208), while four other scenes of the king offering to a goddess-have the terminal for-mula irf di 'nh (ibid., pls. 103, 122, 168, 205). The single exceptional scene in that temple may express theactual meaning of the formula during the time of Seti I.So, too, in the Temple of Seti I at Abydos, a single text on the thickness of a doorway that evokes a god-dess (Isis) contains the formula ir.s n.fdi 'nfr.7S This inscription, along with the frequent reversals of the for-mula in the offering scenes wherein the king offers to a male deity at Abydos,79 substantiates the suggestionthat the phrase was in the process of reinterpretation in the reign of Seti I. The frequency of the reversal inthe Abydos Temple and the examples of ir.s in the Hypostyle Hall and the Abydos Temple suggest that thereinterpretation of this formula began in the reign of Seti I.The ambiguity between the meaning and expression of the formula is reflected in the reliefs ofRamesses II. The formula is employed only eight times in the reliefs of Ramesses II on the Enclosure Wallat Karnak, and all examples are with male donor and recipient. The reversal of irf is irregular; two ex-amples are reversed, three others are not, and three are too damaged to determine their direction.80In contrast to the lack of information that the reliefs of the Enclosure Wall give about the reinterpreta-tion of the formula, earlier dedication inscriptions of the same king at Beit el-Wali strongly suggest that thephrase had undergone a change in its meaning. The formula is rarely employed in that temple, and when itis used, it occurs in the form that is unattested elsewhere: ir nffm di 'ni8 \"it (the offering) is done for him77.

No examples of the formula at Beit el-Wali display reversal of the phrase ir.f.The reliefs at Medinet Habu document the following stage in the iconographic expression of the for-mula; at that temple there is uniform agreement of the gender of the suffix with the deity. However, thepenchant for reversing the phrase irf (and very often the name of the male deity with whom the suffixagrees) continued in an irregular manner. In the case of the scenes of the presentation of Maat in the Courtand Hypostyle Hall of the Temple of Khonsu, eight of the fourteen Maat presentation scenes of Herihor andRamesses XI display such reversal.8 3 In scenes where the king officiates before goddesses and in whichthere can be no confusion about to whom the s suffix of the verb refers, there still is irregular reversal.84A final iconographic innovation that occurs in the Ramesside period is the formula's physical separationfrom the dedication phrase.8\" In such examples, the irf di nb is either placed in a different line from thededication proper or is separated from it by an obvious gap.8\" In another scene, the association of the phrasewith the recipient is emphasized not only by its separation from the donation inscription, but also throughthe reversal of the hieroglyphs to agree with the deity's orientation (Khonsu I, pl. 99).The formula underwent yet another change in the late Third Intermediate Period. Fischer cites severalexamples from the Twenty-fourth Dynasty which indicate that the recipient was still understood to be thesubject of ir. However, scenes from the early Twenty-fifth Dynasty indicate that the formula was reinter-preted again to assume its pre-Ramesside meaning.This change back to the pre-Ramesside use of the formula can be dated to the time of Shepenwepet Iand Amunirdis I. Scenes from Shepenwepet I in the chapel of Osiris Hekadjet display an irregular lack ofagreement between the gender of the recipient and the suffix that follows ir. In one scene thatShepenwepet offers praises to Montu the formula appears as ir.s di 'nb (loc. KH 173), and in another scenein the same structure she offers Maat to Amun (KI) with the formula i'-f di n .This lack of agreement inthe use of the formula is likewise attested in the reign of her successor Amunirdis I. In the chapel of OsirisHekadjet, two large scale offering scenes are accompanied by the Ramesside style phrase irfdi lnihwherein the suffix agrees with the recipient.8 7 However, vertical text bands and the smaller scenes thatframe the doorway of the temple are phrased with ir.s di 'ni in the pre-Ramesside style,88 which suggeststhat the large scale scenes were designed with the help of a Ramesside period copy book and the smallerinformal scenes express the colloquial meaning of the formula.The texts in the tomb chapel of Amunirdis at Medinet Habu consistently appear in the pre-Ramessideform, fr.s di ' n.\".9 Hence, by the end of the lifetime of Amunirdis I, the suffix following the verb ir againagreed in gender with the donor rather than with the recipient. This pattern is consistently expressed in thereliefs of Shepenwepet II and Nitocris (loc. MHC 194b, 203, 213).The same agreement of suffix with the donor continues into the Late period and is attested in severalscenes from the reign of Nectanebo II. On a naos in Cairo, the king is portrayed kneeling upon a stand offer-ing Maat to his double cartouches (Roeder 1914, pl. 12b). The dedication ink M 't n mwfrefers to the fe-male recipient, Bastet (who is not depicted), yet the terminal formula is trfdi n/, indicating that the suffixfollowing tr refers to the donor.82.

During this period, the suffix following ir continues to agree with the genderof the donor. This agreement is made especially clear on the lintel of the doorway of the First Pylon at thePhilae Temple (LD III, pl. 286a). In two vignettes, the king offers incense to Isis and a vase to a male deity.Both scenes bear the formula irfdi n'n.9In the Ptolemaic temples, the phrase occurs only in dedications made in the earlier concise form con-sisting of verb + object + recipient's name rather than as a terminal formula of the more elaborate Ptole-maic-style dedication. Reversals of irf are rare, although the name of the recipient continued to be occa-sionally reversed to place in it the same orientation as the god to whom it referred.9 1Apparently, during the Late period and through the Ptolemaic era, the formula was employed in its pre-Ramesside sense. This reinterpretation explains Fischer's (1977: 100) statement that \"reversals of thephrase in question became less frequent after the New Kingdom.\" The phrase was no longer reversed butplaced in the same orientation as the donor because it again referred to the donor. It must, however, benoted that during the Persian period and beyond, the formula appears in conjunction with the recitation of adivinity. The best examples of this shift of the formula from the recitation of the donor to that of the recipi-ent is attested in the reliefs of the Hibis Temple. There the variation in the formula, viz., ir nf dl nb, ap-pears with some regularity not only in the recitation of the divinity,92 but also in the recitation of the royaldonor.93 At that temple, the concordance of the gender of the suffix following ir indicates that the suffixagrees with the deity.94 There are no reversals of the formula in the Hibis Temple because the orientation ofthe formula agrees with the text of the recitation or dedication, which is usually oriented toward the actor orspeaker.During the Ramesside period the irf element of the ir.fdi 'tin formula referred to the action of the re-cipient; and in the period before the Nineteenth Dynasty the donor was the subject ofthe verb. The underly-ing sense of ir.fdi 'nh in the pre-Ramesside period expressed the king's ability to achieve di 'nb throughhis pious actions (ir.f); during the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties all references to the actions of theking were removed from the formula and the action of the god alone was expressed. Why was the irffdi 'nbphrase not moved to the deity's side of the offering scene in the Ramesside period since it clearly pertainsto the action of the god and not to the activity of the donor? This could be due to the overall composition ofthe offering scenes and the Egyptian reluctance to change traditional iconography. Further, since in both pe-riods the god is often accompanied by the dif 'nh \"he gives life\" formula, perhaps it was thought that theirf di 'nh formula would duplicate the dif 'nb on the recipient's side of the composition. Perhaps this ac-knowledgment that the Ramesside irf di 'inh formula duplicated the meaning of the dif (nb explains whyirf di 'nh so often is absent from the repertoire of the inscriptions that accompany offering scenes of theRamesside era.95The theological significance of the change in the formula is discussed in Chapter 6.GRAMMATICAL FORM OF irf di 'nbSince it is documented that the formula irf di nh and its variants were reinterpreted during theRamesside period, it is worthwhile to examine the grammatical elements of the phrase to see if they toowere modified.90.

How-ever, what tense is the verb ir and does its form change from period to period?Although it is generally accepted that Ir is an optative,% Nims makes the very reasonable suggestionthat in the Ramesside period the phrase is to be translated as a clause of purpose. This interpretation fitswell in the context of offering scenes. In such compositions, irfdi Inb would be translated \"Presenting X ...in order that he (the god) may make given life (for the donor).\"However, the question of the changing nature of the formula has been overlooked in prior discussions ofthe grammar of the phrase.

To apply Nims' clause of purpose to the Eighteenth Dynasty and post-Ramesside phrase irf nf diIn#, when the donor is the subject of ir, would yield the translation \"Presenting X ... in order that he (thedonor) shall act for him who has given life.\"\"' The difficulty with this translation is the phrase's relationshipto the dedication with which it is associated. The dedication, phrased in the infinitive, states that the donoris actively undertaking a certain action. The clause of purpose with an optative \"Presenting X ... in orderthat he (the donor) shall act for him\" is redundant and only repeats the fact that the king is offering to thegod. The phrase is better rendered by the circumstantial \"Presenting X ... in so much as he (the donor) actsfor him who has given life.\"The variant lrfn.fdi nb employed in the Eighteenth Dynasty could conceivably be translated \"in orderthat he (the donor) makes for himself given life,\" in which case this phrase could be a clause of purpose.However, this possibility can be dismissed on the existence of the form ir.s nfdi 'nh dating to Hatshepsut98because the two different suffix pronouns indicate that there were two different participants. The form thatwould definitively support a reflexive translation of the irfn.fdi nh, namely ir.s n.s di n, is not attested.Therefore, in the r.fnfdi 'nb form, the second suffix pronoun must refer to the recipient and hence a trans-lation of ir as a clause of purpose is, on account of its association with the action referred to in the dedica-tion, untenable.If the Ir in these formulas of the Eighteenth Dynasty were taken as a circumstantial sdmfrelated to theinfinitive of the offering formula, it could be rendered \"Presenting X ... (in so much as) he (the donor) actsfor him who has given life.\" Taking ir as a circumstantial therefore places the two phrases in a logical rela-tionship to each other. The dedication, phrased in the infinitive, is a description of the offering activity; theirfnf di n indicates that the king's actions thereby serve the god.But must the pre- and post-Ramesside form irfdi nti, in which the suffix following the verb tr refers tothe donor, be translated as a circumstantial? It does not have to be, because certainly the conventional ren-dering \"Presenting X ... in order that he (the donor) may make given life\" makes very good sense. How-ever, as Fischer notes and is supported by the equivalent scenes from Amunhotep III and Thutmose II andIII, the underlying form of the Irf di ' nl is really irf nf di 'n,9' which does not accommodate itself to in-terpretation as an optative and clause of purpose. Since the two forms are variants of each other, perhapsthe shorter form of the Eighteenth Dynasty and Late period should be viewed linguistically as a circumstan-tial rather than an optative.In the Ramesside period the verb Ir appears with some frequency in variations of the formula such as irnfdl 'n without an expressed subject.'t° This form could be the passive sdmf \"it (the offering) is done.\"96.

These alternatives are discussed below.The use of A (dl) after a female name poses a difficulty, because if it were a participle, the verb shouldappear as An (dit) (GEG3 §§357-61); the Old Perfective form should be A or ,- (diti) (ibid., §309).However, the list of forms of di employed after the name of goddesses or queens demonstrates that the formA (dO) without the expected feminine ending is very commonly employed. An inconsistency in the expres-sion of the feminine ending might be expected in texts of Hatshepsut due to the ambiguity in the gender ofher inscriptions. However, the consistent omission of expected feminine endings is also encountered in textsof Queen Nofertari at Abu Simbel and of the God's Wives at Thebes.17dl in di 'n6 as a Participle. When following a name, either divine or royal, di in di \"nh never exhibits gemi-nation and thus should be considered to be a perfective participle. Several scholars propose that di is a per-fective passive participle and that di 'n6 is derived from rdy n.f 'nb \"to whom life is given\" with an omittedresumptive pronoun.\"' A possible difficulty with this interpretation of the verb as a passive participle is thatthe expected morphological forms of di as a perfective passive participle, dy (....Lfl or &) or rdy( if), are not used. The form that most commonly appears in conjunction with royal or divine names isA(dO), which should be a perfective active participle.\"' However, Edel cites one example of the perfectivepassive participle written simply as &..,120 suggesting that indeed, the form employed after names can beconsidered to be a perfective passive participle. Fischer (1977: 103-06) argues that di was a passive parti-ciple until the Ramesside period, at which time it was considered to be an active participle.The use of the di \"nb formula after the names of deities as well as after the name of kings or queensraises an important issue and indicates that one must look at how the same forms could be used in both con-texts. The answers to two important questions could help to indicate whether dO is active or passive: (in thecontext of the offering scenes, in which di 'n# follows the name of the donor or the recipient) who gives lifeand to whom is life given?Hornung (1982: 199) and Fischer (1977: 97-98)2\"' both strongly argue that in the context of offeringscenes, life emanates from the god who bestows it upon the king. Hence the god as the superior being is theonly source of life. So, too, Derchain suggests that life emanates from the gods to the king in the offering112.

Dif 'nz \"he has given life\"'2 is frequently employedas a caption for the god, and the formula di 'nti \"who has been given life\" is placed near or adjacent to thename of the royal donor.'24 These two formulas illustrate a clear contrast between the donor and the recipi-ent of that gift. The formula associated with the deity stresses his donation of life (dif In# \"he gives life\");the formula associated with the king stresses his role as recipient (dl Inb \"who has been given life\" or\"given life\"). The juxtaposition of these two formulas serves as further evidence that in the offering scenesup to the Late period the source of life was considered to be the god and the recipient of that life was theking.The preceding conclusion that the deity is the only source of life does not apply to situations other thanto offering scenes. The offering scenes, which portray the relationship between the king and his gods,should be differentiated from situations involving the king and his subjects in which the king is frequentlythe giver of life, not only to his subjects, but even to vanquished enemies.25K. Martin (1974: 288; 1977: 26-27) suggests that in the context of the offering scenes the king is ca-pable of giving life.126 In his analysis of the form of di in di 'ntz, Martin suggests that the verb can functionsimultaneously as an active and passive form, concluding that the offering scenes show not only the receiv-ing of life by the king from the god (passive), but also the active form in which the king gives life to his sub-jects. The second action is not portrayed or indicated in the offering scenes and is beyond the immediatesubject matter of the relationship of god to king and the donation of life from the deity to his deputy.Hence, in the time period under consideration and in the context of the phrase di 'nt employed afternames in offering scenes, life is given only from the god to the king. Taking the principle that life originatesfrom the gods and is given to the king as the theological foundation of the activity of the offering ritual, di'nh after the name of a king should be translated as a perfective passive participle \"who has been givenlife\" and not as a perfective active participle \"who has given life,\" because the king in the offering scenes isthe recipient of life from the god. After the name of a deity, the phrase must be taken as a perfective activeparticiple \"who has given life (to the donor)\" rather than \"who has been given life.\"di in di ''n as an Old Perfective. di' in di nh could also be considered to be an Old Perfective form. How-ever di in di ' nb after the name of a god cannot be rendered as an Old Perfective, because if it were an OldPerfective, the formula would have to be translated as a passive (GEG3 §320) \"being given life,\" \"beingcaused to be alive\"; but as it was shown above, the gods do not make life for themselves in the time periodunder discussion.After the name of a ruler, it is possible that di/dit is the Old Perfective because the passive translation iswholly in keeping with the sentiment of the theology of the offering scenes. However, if one wished to iden-tify whether the grammatical form of di is an Old Perfective or a participle after the name of a ruler as well122. \"Anchzeichen,\" LA I, col. 269.123.

A few examplesfrom the reign of Hatshepsut'43 that lack the feminine Old Perfective ending could be a reflection of theambiguity of gender that is evident in her texts.'44It is significant that In.td is not employed after the name of a goddess because goddesses (like gods)were not considered to be the recipients of life, but rather the source of life. Hence it would be inappropri-ate to wish that the deity may have life ('nf.t).THE PHRASE di 1nh IN THE irf di 'nt FORMULAThe following discussion of the function of di and 'nt in the irf di In formula is based upon its use inthe offering formula. The use of dt 'nh in other formulas such as the tr.nfm mnwf 14 is not considered hereexcept as specifically noted for comparative purposes. All examples under consideration are drawn fromthe New Kingdom through the Third Intermediate Period.THE VERB di IN irf di 'nh%The following discussion is based upon several premises that have been discussed elsewhere in thiswork. The first is that the gods are the source of life and that the donor of the offering is the recipient of thatdivine gift. The second consideration is that the form frf di 'nj is an abbreviation of the more explicit irfnf di 'nh formula.The five variations of the irf di n# formula are discussed below; in each of the variants, the verb dlmust be translated as a perfective active participle.1. irf nf dt 'nI2. irhn di 'nh3. ir nf di\" n#4. irf di t'nia.

In this context, a god is not one who is \"given life.\" The use of the per-fective active participle df in this formula is also confirmed by an example used with a female donor (aqueen of Thutmose III) and male divine recipient.14 9 In that example, the verb di appears without any femi-nine ending, suggesting that the verb refers to the male divine recipient. Thus the verb must be an activerather than passive participle because the passive form should, in its agreement with the feminine donor,have a final -t.'50Variant 3. ir nf diC n1[Presenting X to DN] \"it (the offering) is done for him who has given life.\"' 5In a fashion similar to the preceding example, taking the verb as a passive participle \"it is done for him,who has been given life\" would suggest that the offering is for the benefit of the king (who has been givenlife) rather than for the god who has given life to the donor. ir n.fdi 'ni is attested once in the Middle King-dom. It is again employed in the Eighteenth Dynasty (Fischer 1977: 103, no. 281) and is common in the re-liefs of Ramesses IV in the Temple of Khonsu. It continues to be used through the Late period.5 2One might suggest that the form incorporates a sdm.nf form: ir.n.fdi Inh \"he has achieved a givenlife(?).\" However, scenes in the Temple of Khonsu that incorporate a female recipient employ the form irn.s di 'n6.f'\" In this case, the n + suffix must be a dative \"for her\" because if one were to take it as a sdm.nf,the formula would have to be rendered \"she (the goddess) has made a given life(?).\" However, in the pe-riod under discussion the gods do not make life for themselves but rather for the donor. Another objection tothe verb being a sdm.nf is the existence of the existence of the form fi n di nt (\"it is done for the one who has given life\"),which simply omits the suffix after ni. The ability of the formula to be used without an expressed subjectsuggests that the suffix after n is the direct object rather than the subject of the verb fr. Hence the suffixcould be omitted without changing the meaning of the formula because the suffix served as the antecedentof the participle di rather than as the subject of ir.Secondly, the parsing ir n.s/f is favored over hfr.n.s/fbecause at the Hibis Temple the formula occurs inthe context of direct discourse in speeches of deities, preceded by dd mdw in ... .' In such cases, the pas-sive sdmf allows for better coordination between the formula and its context, e.g., \"Words said by (DN), 'It(the offering) is done for him who has given life (to the king).'\" This translation indicates that the king of-fers to the deity, and that the deity acknowledges not only that the offering is being made, but that it is beingmade because of the initial gift of life from god to donor.147.

In such ex-amples the participle di in ir.s di 'n h omits the feminine ending, suggesting that its antecedent is masculine,namely the fof the omitted dative phrase n.f.Treating the irf di 'n as an abbreviation of the longer r.f nf di 'n allows one to eliminate the possi-bility of the verb being a perfective passive participle (\"hereby he [the donor] acts for him (the god), whohas been given life\"), because again, such a translation indicates that the god was given life by the king. So,too, the possibility of the form being a perfective passive participle with the meaning \"he (the donor) actsfor him(self), namely the king who has been given life\" can be eliminated by the form ir.s nf di 'n# (Deirel-Bahari II, pl. 27). Although, as noted, there are difficulties with the irregular use of feminine endings thatare expected in such formulas, the masculine form of di suggests that it refers to thef in the dative expres-sion and that the formula should then be translated with a perfective active participle: \"she (the donor) actsfor him (the god) who has given life.\" Hence, the verb in the masculine and feminine forms of irf/s nf di'nh must be considered to be a perfective active participle: \"hereby he/she (the donor) acts for him (thegod) who has given life (to the donor).\"Although the irf di 'nh is an abbreviation of the longer ir.f f di 'n formula, irf di 'nb is a far morecommon form. There are difficulties in producing an accurate translation of the short form that expressesthe perfective active participle. Because unless one acknowledges the omitted dative that allows for asmooth English rendering, one is forced to translate the verb in the short form (lrf dl 'n#) as a perfectivepassive participle (\"hereby he acts, the one who has been given life\") in order to indicate clearly that theking is the recipient rather than the donor of life.A scene from Sinai inscriptions of Thutmose III appears as , (Gardiner and Peet 1917, pl.59, n. 189).

It cannot berendered by means of a perfective passive participle without indicating that the god is one \"who has beengiven life,\" which is not the case in the offering scenes.One might suggest that dl is an Old Perfective (\"it is done for him as one given life\"). An objection tothis is that m + Old Perfective is a suspect construction, which is more likely to be expressed by means ofnty + Old Perfective (GEG3 §328) or more commonly by the use of m + perfective passive participle.One might also suggest that the phrase is to be parsed as ir.nf m di ~ni employing a sdm.nf form, \"he(the king)'\"9 has acted as one who has been given life\" (taking the dl as a perfective passive participle).Although this is a possible translation, because neither the theological content nor the grammar make it im-possible, it is perhaps better to take the phrase as ir n.fm di 'nb for several reasons. First, no other varia-tions of the irf dl fnb employ a sdm.nf form.\"6Secondly, if the Beit el-Wali formula, specifically the one example that is preceded by a full dedication(hnk MI't n itf \"presenting Maat to his father\"; Beit el-Wali, pl. 32C) were translated as a sdm.nf, it wouldbe rendered \"presenting Maat to his father, he (the king) has acted, being the one who has been given life.\"This translation seems redundant, especially in comparison to the forms that employ the circumstantial \"hehereby acts (for him, the god) who has given life\" (variant 4b).The same objection is valid for one of the other versions of this formula at Beit el-Wali: irt M?~t ir nfmdi 'nb (B 14), which if a sdm.nf would be translated \"Presenting (irt) Maat, he (the king) has acted as onewho has been given life.\" The third example from the temple lacks any dedication before the ir nfm di 'nh(ibid., pl. 32F) and therefore no conclusions can be drawn concerning the coordination between the dedica-tion and the ir nfm dl 'nt formula.Taking the form as a sdm.nf rather than as the passive sdm.f+ dative nfcould also be objected to uponthe grounds that such parsing results in the omission of any mention of the god and thus is in marked con-trast to the other Ramesside forms that refer to the god by means of a pronoun: irfnfdi 'nt \"hereby he actsfor him (the god) who has given life\" (variant 1), ir nf di 'nh \"it is done for him (the god) who has givenlife\" (variant 3), irfdi 'n n \"in order that he (the god) may act, (he) who has given life ... \" (variant 4a), orby means of the participle fr n di 'n1: \"it is done for the one (the god) who has given life\" (variant 2).The other two examples of ir nfm di \"nt from Beit el-Wali that lack any indication of the name or titleof the divine recipient in the dedicationt\"' could indicate that indeed the nf is to be viewed as a dative ex-pression which supplies a specific reference to the god. If one were to take the nf in the Beit el-Wali for-mula (Ir nffm di 'nb) as the dative, [it is done] \"for him\" (i.e., the god), rather than as the past tense verbending (\"he has acted\"), the Beit el-Wali formula could be regarded as having the components of the othervariations of the frf di nji, mainly, an indication of the action (\"it is done\") and for whom the action is in-tended (\"for him\"). The dative expression then serves as a specific reference to the divine member of theoffering ritual.Although it is possible to view the Beit el-Wali formula as incorporating a sdm.nf form, a comparisonof this formula to the other variations suggests that it more properly should be parsed as ir nfm di n.SUMMARYThe discussion (above) of the various forms of the phrase ir.f di 'n indicates that in all of the variationof the formula, the verb dl is a perfective active participle and that the perfective active participle was not,as suggested by Fischer, restricted to a certain time period.'62to the god or if the king has been given life by the god.

No longer does the king's action produce \"given life.\" Rather, in the Ramesside period, in the contextof the irf df nhl formula, the king is merely a recipient of life from the gods. All emphasis is placed uponthe god's ability to make life for the king. It is tempting to interpret the Eighteenth Dynasty form Ir nf di'nh \"It is done for him who has given life\" and the Ramesside variation ir n di Inb \"it is done for the onewho has given life\" as attempts to express more deliberately the changing emphasis of the formula. Thesetwo variations of the irfdi 'nh may indeed be viewed as transitional phrases that do not yet reflect theRamesside meaning that the god is the subject of the verb tr.'63 The theological implications of this changeare discussed in Chapter 6.THE RECITATION OF THE GODSThe recipient and attendants in scenes of the presentation of Maat or of other offerings are very fre-quently accompanied by a recitation introduced by the di.n(.1) n.k formula. Generally there is very little dif-ference in the form and content of any of these brief inscriptions, although that of the attendant behind theking may be a more elaborate commentary upon the proceedings (Al3).THE di.n(.i) n.k FORMULAIn scenes of the presentation of Maat, this first portion of the recitation, with few exceptions, appears inthe sdm.nf form.\" The use of the normally perfect form has sparked considerable discussion of its functionin the context of offering scenes. Gunn and Gardiner, and more recently Helck and others,'6 5 take this formto be a synchronous present tense, assuming that the action of the recipient is present, relative to the actionof the donor. This analysis of the verb form as a synchronous present has long been subjected to scrutiny.166Wente, in agreement with Edel, takes it as a perfect, implying that the action of the god is anterior to that ofthe donation.67 More recently, this form has been the subject of analysis by Zabkar and Vernus.Zabkar's (1981: 141-71) study focuses upon the sdm.nf and its alternation with the sdmf, particularlyin the context of the solar hymns published by Assmann (1969; 1975).168 Whereas kabkar (1981) concludesthat the sdm.nf in the solar hymns is the nominal form which serves to emphasize a following circumstantialsdm.f,'169 he believes that the sdm.nf form in the context of the di.n(.d) n.k formula seems to emphasize \"theenduring action completed in the past, an action by which the jubilees, as well as many other benefits werebestowed upon the king from the very beginning of his reign\" (ibid., pp. 171, 169).171163. The two forms are used in parallelism on CO 34013 in of-fering scenes of Thutmose III (Urk. IV, 764.8, 14: Ir nfdi'nt; 764.11: ir n di ' nb).164. For such exceptions, see Anomalous Forms, below.165.

Gunnrecognizes the perfect connotation and Gardiner tends totranslate the form primarily as a present. See also Wente1971: 316.166. See, for example, Edgerton and Wilson 1936: 4, no. 13a:\"We have here retained the traditional tense rendering ofthe sdm.nf, because one of us feels that the Egyptians in-tended a past tense with these words.\" See also Assmann1969: 292 ff.; Ray 1972: 252; 2abkar 1981: 168-71, espe-cially p. 168 for a brief bibliography of the question of theso-called synchronous present.167.

In contrast, Assmann (1969: 356) con-cludes that the intransitive sdm.f and the transitive sdm.nfindicate contemporaneity (\"Gleichzeitigkeit\"). For a sum-mary of Assmann's argument, see Zabkar 1981: 145-47.170. But see Zabkar's (1981: 170) curious comment that \"Thisresponse is expressed in a general, stereotyped, endlesslyrepeated, but nevertheless emphatic sdm.nf form.\" Theuse of the term \"response\" suggests that the action con-veyed by the s4m.nf is posterior to any other action in theoffering scene. However, labkar's thesis is that action ex-pressed in the s4m.n.f occurred before (past tense) theother actions of such scenes.69oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"THE PRESENTATION OF MAAT: RITUAL AND LEGITIMACY IN ANCIENT EGYPTVernus' (1985: 307-16, 378-82) analysis relies upon a synthesis of the grammatical construction andthe actions depicted in the scene. He terms the sdm.nf form used in the offering scenes \"ritual\" or\"performative\" and attempts to demonstrate how the phrase is related to the scene not in tense, but in as-pect, conveying the sense of accompli.Vernus (1985: 307-16, 378-82), to a greater degree than Zabkar (1981: 169-70), emphasizes a verybasic feature of the offering scenes, namely, that the action described in the din(.) n.k formula is only pe-ripherally, if at all, related to the action of the god.17' Indeed, in these ritual scenes, the god stands or isseated stiffly before the donor. He or she is not shown presenting the boon to which the formula refers. Thisdiscrepancy between the iconography and the verbal expression mitigates heavily against Gunn andGardiner's synchronous present.According to Vernus' (1985: 312-13) conclusions, in the context of the offering scenes, this \"ritual\" or\"performative\" functions without regard for the temporal context of the donation;72 the gods have given;their action is accompli and it is remote from the offering of the king. Therefore, the recipient is shown in aninactive pose because his donation has already been accomplished. He suggests that the sdm.nf form in thiscontext conveys that the action is \"past in regard to the moment of speaking, but that this fact is definitelyestablished ...\" (ibid., p. 312).Zabkar (1981: 171) and Wente (1971: 316; Beit el-Wali, pl. 31, n. d to pl. 41B) propose, upon differentgrounds, that the dl.n(.) n.k in such a use refers to an action that occurred prior to the king's offering activ-ity. In the context of the offering scenes, in which there is no correspondence between the iconography andthe inscription, this makes good sense because according to Wente and Zabkar, in such scenes the god's do-nation expressed in the sdm.nf occurred before the offering of the king, which is the focus of the ritual rep-resentation. 2abkar does allow that the two activities are related; it is because the god has given life thatthe king is able to offer to the gods. As Hornung (1982: 203) indicates, there is no reason to assume that theoffering is a \"tribute demanded from him\" but rather that the action of the king is an act of piety.173In summary, the sdm.nf form employed in the recitation of the recipient is the nominal sdm.nf. Theprepositional phrase n.k \"to you\" serves as the adverbial adjunct of the nominal; hence di.n(.i) n.k 'nh nb\"It is to you that I have given all life.\" The perfect tense nominal sdm.nf form is employed in the context ofoffering scenes because it clearly indicates that the activity of the god precedes any ritual action of the do-nor,17 4 and it stresses the relationship of the god and king through the emphasis placed upon the adverbialadjunct n.k \"it is to you.\"The use of the perfect in the di.n(.) n.k. formula creates a good correspondence between the inscriptionand the iconography. The god sits motionless, because as expressed through the di.n(.() n.k formula, the ac-tion referred to has already taken place. Wente and Zabkar's perfect \"I have given\" indicates that the godshave performed their action before the king makes his donation to the deity.171. Zabkar discusses the coordination of inscription with ico-nography primarily in connection with the use of the sdmfin ritual scenes.172. However, Vernus (1985: 312 ff.) attempts to support hisposition with a text of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari (Urk.IV, 300.1-9). In his discussion, he contrasts a series ofwhat he takes to be sdmf forms to sdm.n.f forms. However,as pointed out by Edward Wente (pers. comm.), the sup-posed sd.mf forms are feminine perfective active parti-ciples (Urk. IV, 2-6), which is confirmed by line 6 of thattext: Irt mrrt m Irt n nbt nfrt wbt ... \"who has done what[1] desire, in making every good and pure thing ...\" (trans-lated by Vernus as \"thus makest what I love, in making forme every good and pure thing ...\"). Here, irt cannot be anominal s4mf (fr.t) as Vernus suggests because in the textthe verb displays no gemination and thus it must be a per-fective active participle. In turn, the verbs that precede itare better taken as perfective active participles than nomi-nal sdmf forms. The same problem with identifying parti-ciples as supposed nominal sdmf forms is also encoun-tered with Vernus' (1985: 312-13) analysis of the SpeosArtemidos inscription of Hatshepsut (Urk. IV, 290.1-9).173. For more on the relationship of the action of god and king,see General Conclusions, below.174. Poo's (1984: 160, 163) comments that \"the king's bless-ings and gifts ... were commonly expected of the deities inreaction to an offering,\" which is similar both to Nelson's\"He (the king) receives from Amun those blessings ... inreward for his pious acts\" (1949: 344) and to Bjorkman's\"That this grant [life] is made in return for what the kinghas done ...\" (1971: 39-40). However, it is not clear fromBjorkman's discussion whether she is referring to the giftof 'nb in the d.n(.) n.k formula (which is anterior to thedonation of the king) or in the trfdi nh (which is a resultof the king's action). Frandsen (1989: 95, 100, 104) andSmith (1994: 79) more clearly express the idea that the do-nation of the god is made in response to the action of thedonor rather than, as suggested in this work, prior to thataction.70oi.uchicago.edu"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"INSCRIPTIONSTHE USE OF THE sdm.f FORM IN THE RECITATION OF THE GODSAlthough the sdm.nf is the nearly universally employed form in the recitation of the divine recipientand attendants, there are infrequent occurrences of the sdmf form.17In certain scenes, the sdmf and sdm.nfoccur in the same relief as apparent variations in the dLn(.) n.kformula,176 while in other scenes the sdmf is employed in place of the usual sdm.nf. This alternation offorms could be due to a desire to avoid the repetition of like consonantal signs; hence dl(.1) n.k ... ford((.n.() n.k (GEG3 §62). However, this possibility is made unlikely by the alternation of the sdmf andsdm.nf forms of verbs, such as h.i and ti.n.1, wherein two forms are clearly differentiated (Wente 1969: 12-13).The use of the sdmf in parallelism to the sdm.nf form would formerly have been explained through the\"synchronous present,\" assuming that the two forms were identical and both expressed the present tense.More recently, Wente and Zabkar have addressed the use of the sdmf where one might otherwise expectthe sdm.nf. In his treatment of the sdm.nf form in religious hymns, Zabkar (1981: 171) concludes that thesdm.f, which he takes as a \"synchronous sdm.f,\" describes the simultaneous action depicted in the scene andthe narration, and the sdm.nf form, which is an emphatic form, stresses the \"enduring effect of an actioncompleted in the past.\"Wente (1969: 11-13) cites a number of examples of the alternation of the two verb forms, culled prima-rily from Ramesside period sources. He concludes that examples of the sdm.f form of verbs of motion arethe Late Egyptian nominal sdm.f, which as the equivalent of the Middle Egyptian nominal sdm.nfof verbsof motion is interchangeable with the earlier form.\"77Examples of the sdm.f used where one might expect the sdm.nf can be grouped into two different cat-egories; those which demonstrate Zabkar's use of the circumstantial sdmf in place of the sdm.nf, and thosein which the verb is Wente's Late Egyptian nominal sdmf.178 As indicated by Zabkar (1981: 169-70), thetwo different uses are often distinguished by the relationship of the inscription to the relief. The circumstan-tial narrates action that is depicted in the scene, whereas the Late Egyptian nominal is unrelated to the ac-tion of the offering's recipients.179An example of the use of the circumstantial sdmf in direct opposition to the sdm.nf appears in thediL.n(.J) n.k formulas on a double scene in an architrave at Medinet Habu (MH VI, pl. 389A).10 Both vi-gnettes portray Amun-Re offering an 'tnh to the nose of the Horus falcon hieroglyph that begins the writingof the full titulary of Ramesses III. On the right side of the scene, the sdm.nf form is employed: d(.n(.1) n.khbw-sd ml R' \"I have given to you jubilees like Re.\" To the right, Amun's recitation employs the sdmfform: dii nh ws rfnd.k nb twy mrr R1 \"I hereby give life and dominion to your nose, oh Lord of the TwoLands, you who love Re.\" The sdmf which here is a circumstantial form correctly narrates the actions of thegod who holds an 'nh and wls. This form is in contrast to that of the opposite side which employs the nomi-nal sdm.nf in reference to jubilees, which have no corresponding representation in the scene.'8' As Zabkar(1981: 171) notes, the circumstantial sdmf is employed to stress the \"simultaneity of Amun's word and hisgesture\" and the nominal stresses \"the enduring effect of an action completed in the past.\"175.

This scene has many iconographic irregularities. Onemight argue that this is not an offering scene since here thegod offers rather than is being offered to. Essentially, theroles of donor and recipient are reversed.

There Nekhbet, standing behind Ramesses IV, holds theyear-rib hieroglyph that is decorated with heb-sed signs. The inscription reads di.s hbw-sd \"She hereby givesjubilees.\" As on the left side of the Medinet Habu architrave, the inscription at the Temple of Khonsu di-rectly relates to action portrayed in the scene and hence is the circumstantial rather than the Late Egyptiannominal sdmf.As mentioned above, the second use of the sdmf as the Late Egyptian nominal can be distinguishedfrom the first use of the sdmf by the lack of any correlation between the inscription and the scene which itnarrates. Several examples of the Late Egyptian nominal sdmf, which is translated as a perfect active in of-fering formulas, occur in the reliefs in the Temple of Seti I at Kanais.82 Although the sdm.nf form is em-ployed elsewhere on the monument in the di.n(.) n.k formula, a dedication inscription on the back of a pil-lar appears as dl(.i) n.k 'h'wf m nb t3wy \"I have given to you his lifetime as Lord of the Two Lands.\"'83Here, the inscription does not occur in the context of a pictorial relief but rather is a statement that the grantwas given and therefore is framed in the Late Egyptian nominal sdmf, which could be confirmed by paralleltexts (in the same hallway) that employ the Middle Egyptian equivalent, i.e., the nominal sdm.nf.'84 An-other such example from the same monument occurs in conjunction with the presentation of wine: di. n.k'h'w n R' rnpwt n Itm ... \"I have given to you the lifetime of Re and the years of Atum.\"'85 A parallel in-scription on the opposite wall employs the Middle Egyptian nominal sdm.nf form: din(.1) n.k 'h'w n R'rnpwt n \"Itm \"I have given to you the lifetime of Re and the years of Atum,\" as the king adores the god.'8Another example of the use of the Late Egyptian form occurs on a monument at Medinet Habu, the inscrip-tions on which bear other traces of the later stages of grammar mixed with the classical forms (Wente 1969:11-14). This scene on the exterior south wall below the calendar depicts the king \"recounting his benefac-tions\" to Amun and Mut. Behind the recipients stand Khonsu and Maat (MH III, pl. 136). Two examples ofthe Late Egyptian nominal form are employed in the recitations of the gods in this scene. In the first ex-ample, the text associated with Khonsu must be interpreted as the Late Egyptian nominal, which is madeevident not only by the type of gift that he gives (the temple itself), which has no correlation to the image,but perhaps also through the following Old Perfective that qualifies the temple: di iwt.k mn.ti m pt ...Here, the nominal emphasizes the adverbial phrase which follows: \"It is like heaven that I have caused yourtemple to be established ....\" This statement is paralleled in the same scene by the recitation of Maat thatalso employs the Late Egyptian nominal sdr.f form: smn.i n.k hpw n rn.l r shtp ib n ntrw ... \"It is in order tosatisfy the heart(s) of the gods that I have established for you laws in (n) my name.\"'87A more problematic example of the use of the sdmf in an offering scene occurs in the Hall of theTemple of Seti I at Kanais, in which the king is portrayed offering Maat to Amun-Re who holds 'nh- andwis-emblems in his hands (A5).'88 The recitation of the god poses several difficulties (-).Because the action of the god does correspond to the inscription, the di n.k 'nh w?s could be the circum-stantial sdmf: \"I hereby give to you life and dominion.\" The first phrase poses more difficulties because itcan parsed as tr.n.k or as tr(.f) n.k with decidedly different implications for its meaning. If one were to takethe phrase as the nominal sdm.nf, emphasizing the following subjunctive, the sentence would be renderedas \"It is in order that I shall give you life and dominion that you (the donor) have acted.\" An objection tothis translation is that the rendering indicates that the god's grant of life follows the activity of the donor. Itseems unlikely that this one inscription would express a completely different sequence within the offeringritual.182. Weigall 1908: 78 (east wall, second scene), 81 (back of 188.

This second andpreferable rendering of the passage brings it into accordance with the huge corpus of inscriptions which in-dicate that the god has made the initial donation, which in turn makes the subsequent action of the donorpossible.ANOMALOUS FORMSTwo scenes of Ramesses III employ an anomalous form of the verb in the god's recitation. In a scene inhis temple at Karnak, Ramesses III presents a rebus of his prenomen to Ptah and Sekhmet acts as attendantto the god. Her recitation appears as [dd mdw in Szmrt] di S#mt hht r Oftyw.k ~c ~ (Fl ).The form of the pronoun after the verb could be an unusual writing of the first person feminine singular suf-fix, which is suggested by such a writing of the first person singular feminine suffix c in a passage fromthe Gurob Papyrus (Gardiner 1940: 14.6; E. F. Wente, pers. comm.), and its variant, simply n, in a hymn inthe tomb of Thothemheb (Assmann 1978: 30h). Hence, the -t following hh must be a writing of the first per-son singular and the recitation could then be interpreted as di. hh.i r fftyw.k.'\" The recitations of the otherdivine attendants in the offering scenes shown in conjunction with that showing the presentation of theprenomen are phrased in the sdm.nf form (RIK II, pl. 99A-C), and therefore the d. of Sekhmet could bethe equivalent, the Late Egyptian perfect: \"Words said by great Sekhmet, beloved of Ptah, 'I have set my fi-ery blast against your enemies.'\"The second passage in the Second Court at Medinet Habu that depicts the king presenting a sbt toSekhmet also displays an unusual writing of the suffix pronoun after the verb di, On the ba-sis of the writing of the first person singular in the Karnak inscription of Ramesses III and in the Gurob pa-pyrus, one might suggest that in the Medinet Habu inscription, the * following the verb is a writing of theLate Egyptian third person singular feminine suffix pronoun en (.s)192 with the signs transposed: di.s snb'nht dd wls nb. Another solution to the reading of this passage is to take the bread loaf -t as an element inthe writing of di '1,'93 followed by the conventional orthography of the third person feminine suffix. Anadditional difficulty with this passage is posed by the use of the third person rather than the first personwhich is required for the direct discourse expected after dd mdw in. A possible explanation is that the recita-tion of the goddess has simply been omitted. Examples of such an omission are attested elsewhere atMedinet Habu, in the Beit el-Wali Temple, and in the royal tombs at Luxor.194 If so, the verb might be takenas a circumstantial and hence the Medinet Habu passage would be rendered \"Words said by great Sekhmet,beloved of Ptah ... (recitation omitted) ... as she gives all health, life, stability, and dominion.\"THE GODS' DONATIONThe gods grant a great variety of material and spiritual virtues to the donor of Maat. These include:power (.kn or nbt), eternity (dt, nhh), kingship in the aspect of certain other gods (nsyt n R' nsyt 'UItm, etc.),the lifetime of Re ('hl n Re), strength (phty), the two lands, years, various types of provisions (dfiw, htpw),truth of kingship (m't m nsyt), the throne or seat of various gods, jubilees, and combinations of 'nb, dd,ws, and snb nb. Clearly all of these are attributes or possessions of a good king. A difficulty in the interpre-tation of the relationship of these donations to the presentation of Maat lies in the fact that these sameboons are also granted to the king in scenes of more mundane and routine donations such as flowers or190.

Amunirdis II is granted the thrones of Tefnut and Wadjyet (K7).202 The most com-mon recitation among the God's Wives is some combination of ws n (K4, 6-7, 10).203In summary, although all of the virtues granted by the gods to whom the offering of Maat is made arerelated to ideals of kingship, none of the items named in the god's recitation are exclusively linked with thepresentation of Maat.GRANTS BY ATTENDANTSIn some scenes, Maat is presented to the gods in the presence of another figure who is differentiatedfrom the other attendants by his or her position behind the donor. With the exception of some examples ofclasses K and 0, all these figures who act as attendants to the king are deities.205The recitation of the attendant behind the king is not appreciably different from that of the attendantson the other side of the king. The formula most often takes the form d.n(.) n.k and, like the recitations al-ready discussed, promises various kingly attributes and virtues.20 6 Rather than being an almost inanimatefigure who receives the offering and intones a formal recitation, the king's attendant in turn makes an offer-ing to the donor of an elongated year-rib staff hieroglyph adorned with either jubilees20 7 or ~h1, dd, wlssymbols (A 14). In other examples, the interaction between the two participants takes the form of the atten-dant touching an np to the back of the donor (F15).In certain examples, the recitation of the king's attendant is expanded to give it a more active nature.Like the dl.n(.l) n.k formula of the recipient and the recipient's attendants, the phrase occasionally displaysthe substitution of the circumstantial sdmf for the more usual din(.f) n.k. However, there is no more than anoccasional association of the more active poses with the use of the circumstantial form. An example of thecircumstantial form employed with activity on the part of the king's attendant can be cited from MedinetHabu (A13). There, the attendant, Harsiese, crowns the king with the atef while reciting smn.i n.k itf .r tp.kisp.k nsyt R m wd it.k nb ntrw Pth km,? nfrw.k \"I hereby fix for you the atef upon your head; you have re-ceived the kingship of Re as your father the Lord of the Gods, Ptah who has created your beauty has or-dained.\" The circumstantial sdmf is used to coordinate the inscription with the activity of the attendant. An-other particularly clear example of the coordination of the circumstantial sdmf with the activity of the atten-dant is seen in the Temple of Khonsu (A28). There, Thoth inscribes jubilees on his palette as he intones ss.in.k hbw-sd n R' ... \"I hereby inscribe the jubilees of Re for you ... .\" This is in contrast to the dl.n(.i) n.kformula that occurs before Mut d.n(.() n.k \"'nt ws nb mi R' \"I have given to you all life and dominion likeRe.\" In this example, the di.n(.) n.k serves to emphasize the prior donation of life and dominion by thegoddess, and the circumstantial narrates the action of the god. Although the attendant plays a more activerole than the recipients in a limited number of scenes, there is no significant difference in their roles.195. MH V, pis. 263A, 346A; MH VIII, pl. 618F.

For ex-ample, Ankhefenmut (07) intones praise for the divine recipient Ptah rather than any boon on behalf of thedonor. Likewise, in scenes where Shoshenq acts as the attendant for Ankhnesneferibre (K9-10), he is ac-companied by his titles alone. This lack of any recitation analogous to that of the divine attendants suggeststhat in the context of the offering scenes, the di.n(.i) n.k formula was an action restricted to the gods whofunction as direct participants in the ritual.PRESENTATION OF THE ROYAL NAME EQUATED WITH MAATThere is little distinction between the inscriptions that narrate the presentation of Maat and those whichshow the offering of the prenomen or nomen equated with Maat. This lack of differentiation is most clear inthe dedication inscription that explicitly refers to the royal name which incorporates the goddess' image asMaat (pl. 12; F18), indicating that the ancient Egyptians equated the ritual of the presentation of the royalRamesside name with the presentation of Maat. The shared dedication also indicates that Maat and theRamesside royal name which incorporated Maat were equated with each other. The association betweenthe two rituals suggests that the majority of the Ramesside kings compounded their throne names with thename Maat because the king's name, persona, and even his office were so closely associated with the god-dess. This association of the king and his name is most clearly expressed by a complex presentation scene(pl. 17, B29) in the tomb of Shoshenq III at Tanis that shows the Horus name of the king presenting Maat toSokar.208 Although the king is not specifically referred to as Maat, by extension, since the king is equatedwith his name and the name is associated with Maat, the king himself is also closely associated with thegoddess.20 9 This association may be born out by the brief inscription which accompanies a scene ofMemeptah offering Maat stating that the king is \"united with her [Maat]\" by means of his offering.210The only distinction between the dedication inscriptions for the offering of the royal name and of Maatlies in the decided preference for the use of the verb hnk in this context.21' This use of hnk is a reflection ofthe Ramesside preference for the use of that verb in all types of offering scenes. Ramesses III alone retainsthe use of the full writing of the infinitive (rdt), although, similar to the other Ramesside kings, he usuallyemploys hnk.212 In the single example of the presentation of the prenomen of Ramesses V, the verb di isemployed (Fl19).The many reliefs that depict Ramesses IV presenting his name in the Ambulatory of the Temple ofKhonsu display considerable variation from the scenes of other Ramesside kings who present theirprenomens (Seti I, Ramesses II, III, V, VI, XI). In that temple, the iconography of the scene directly followsthat of his patronymic forefathers, yet the inscriptions do not directly equate his name with Maat. At theTemple of Khonsu, rather than narrating the scene with the customary hnk M't n ... formula, the dedicationis either missing (Fl4--17)213 or it takes the form hnk rn fpsy n ... (presentation of the nomen: pl. 11; H2) orhnk.1 n.k rn wr (prenomen: pl. 12; Fl8). These examples are of special interest because they indicate thatafter year two, when Ramesses IV decorated the ambulatory around the sanctuary of the Temple ofKhonsu,214 there was a deliberate avoidance of the traditional equation of the royal name with Maat. Thisvariation in traditional iconography that is so closely related to the idea of Ramesside kingship could beconsidered another feature which distinguishes the reign of Ramesses IV from the other Ramesside kings.2 5208.

In scenes that have only one of these elements, there is a pref-erence for expressing the dedication. The phrases that narrate the presentation of Maat are stereotyped of-fering formulas-in form, vocabulary, and grammar-that are not unique to the presentation of Maat or theroyal name. In this respect, the phrases supply a disappointing amount of information about the specific sig-nificance of the Maat offering ritual. However, in the overall view, they do shed considerable light upon therelationship of the presentation of Maat to other offering rituals in general and to the theology of offeringrites.The intent of the inscriptions, in their grammar and phraseology, is to illustrate not only the relationshipbetween the officiant and recipient, but also their respective nature and role in the offering ritual. Each sec-tion of the tripartite offering inscriptions employs a specific verb form that differentiates it from the othersections of the offering formula.2 7 A basic question that serves to illuminate the theology of the offeringritual is how are these three inscriptions related to each other?The dL.n(,.) n.k in the god's recitation refers to the activity of the god. Once thought to be a synchronouspresent, the form is identified as a nominal form by Zabkar (1981: 169) and as a \"ritual\" sdm.nf by Vernus(1985: 311-12). Wente, Edel, Zabkar, and Junge agree that the form is to be translated as present per-fect.218 With the discrediting of the older synchronous present, the dl.n(.1) n.k can be recognized as essen-tially a perfect form. It is the only section of the offering formula that usually occurs in the sdm.nf. This per-fect is used to differentiate the action referred to in the recitation of the god from the other subsequent ac-tions conveyed by the dedication and the irfdi nb.t The phrasing of the formula in the past clearly indicatesthat the god has given certain basic aspects of a powerful king to the donor, particularly the wish for an eter-nity of years, for very many jubilees, and for the rulership of the two lands, all of which are aspects of en-during kingship. The qualities and boons referred to in the di.n(.() n.k formula are therefore considered toprovide the underpinning for the king's existence and for his subsequent actions before the gods. It is be-cause of the virtues expressed in the di.n(.i) n.k that the king is king.How is the dL.n(.f) n.k of the god related to the king's donation? As stated, the boons referred to in thegods' recitations provide the basis for the king's existence, and it is because of those boons that the king canoffer to the gods.2\"'9 However, as Homrnung (1982: 203) suggests, there is no strong evidence to indicate thatthe offering of the king is something \"demanded\" of the king because the god gave him life at some earlierperiod.220The activity of the king is expressed by the infinitive form. The use of the infinitive creates a clear coor-dination of the iconography with the inscription and underscores the activity that is portrayed in the offeringscene.The relationship of the irf di nb formula to the di.n(f) n.k and to the dedication is more complex. Asnoted, the irf dl nb displays variations, such as to whom the suffix following the verb Ir refers. Althoughthe form of Ir could be viewed as an optative in the simple irf di 'nz formula throughout all periods, thisphrase is derived from the Irfnfdl nl formula and hence should technically be viewed as a circumstantialform.Ramesses IV; see Beit el-Wali, 37-38, for additional corn- 219.

The optative \"[Presenting X ] may he (the recipi-ent) make given life (for the donor)\" suggests that the renewal of life from the divine recipient was re-garded as being in a causal relationship to the action of the donor. The action of the king was made in an-ticipation of repeatedly receiving \"given life\" from the divine recipient. In contrast, the circumstantial formswith perfective active participles-\"[Presenting X] hereby he (the donor) acts for him (the god) who hasgiven life\" (of the pre- and post-Ramesside periods), and \"[Presenting X] (hereby) it is done for the onewho has given life\" of the Ramesside period-serve only as acknowledgments of the god's action (dl.n[.l]n.k), rather than an expression of any future grant from the god on account of the donor's action.To what extent do the three elements of the offering scenes together express the often cited do ut desrelationship? As discussed above, in all periods the first action in the offering sequence is the donation oflife and other basic gifts from the gods (dl.n[.i] n.k). This initial gift enables the donor to offer to the gods(\"offering X to Y\"). As suggested, the scenes from the Eighteenth Dynasty and post-Ramesside period thatemploy a circumstantial in the irf di n# formulas (irf nf di 'np / Irf dl 'nj \"hereby he acts for the onewho has given life\")221 serve only as an acknowledgment of the king's offering and hence in those eras thethree elements of the offering formula were not considered to express the cyclic do ut des relationship be-tween donor and recipient because there is no link between the king's presentation and a repeated gift oflife from the gods.The relationship of king and god expressed in offering scenes in the pre- and post-Ramesside periods isbetter expressed as a \"cooperative\" rather than a do ut des relationship. The gods provide the basic valuesof life for the king, and the gods enjoy the offerings that mankind brings, but the gods' actions are not di-rectly influenced by the king's actions.The situation in the Ramesside period is more complex. The irfdi 'nO of the Ramesside era \"may he(the god) make given life (for the donor)\" contrasts with the forms ir nf dl 'nb \"it is done for the one whohas given life\" and ir nfm di 'nh \"it is done for him (the god) who has given life.\" In the irf di 'nb of theRamesside period, all three elements of the offering inscription \"I have given to you life/presenting X to Y/may he (the recipient) make given life (for the donor)\" are linked and the three formulas form a continuouschain of interconnected events. However, in contrast to this are the other Ramesside forms, ir n.fdi 'n andir n.fm di 'nh, which, similar to the pre- and post-Ramesside forms, serve only as an acknowledgment ofthe original donation of the god and thus do not express the do ut des relationship. Hence the offering scenesin the Ramesside period express an inconsistency in their theological content.Thus in the pre- and post-Ramesside periods as well as in many scenes of the Ramesside era that em-ploy forms other than the irffdi 'ni, there is no expression of a true do ut des relationship in which a cyclicoffering from god to man to god is expressed.22 2 In scenes from those periods, the action of the king isclearly related to the god's dl.n(.) n.k because the boons granted by the god allow the king the prestige andposition that allow him to offer to the gods.2 23 However, the action of the king does not guarantee or evenallude to any further divine action because the phrase and its variants other than the Ramesside irfdl nfunction only as an acknowledgment of the god's initial donation rather than referring to any result of theking's offering.The brief inscriptions that accompany offering scenes illustrate an additional aspect of the relationshipof king to god. This aspect is indicated by the use of the third person pronoun for the king in the dedication(n itf \"to his father\") and the first person for the divine recipient in the divine recitation (dl.n[.i] \"I havegiven\").2 2 4 These forms create a balance and contrast of specificity; the king as the corporate personality ofEgypt is non-specific;225 the donor is \"he\" or \"she\" rather than a specific egocentric \"I\" before the gods.

Thisfeature eliminates any single or personal identity of the donor of Maat, because the donor is not an indi-vidual in this context, he/she is the representative of mankind who interacts with the gods. In contrast, thedivine recipient and attendants are usually referred to in the first person. Each god personally deeds an as-pect of kingship to the donor. They are individuals who interact with the representative of humanity who of-fers Maat.This differentiation of specific god and lack of specificity of donor in the offering texts suggests that thescenes are to be viewed from the reference point of the gods. In an offering scene, the god speaks in thefirst person (dl.n[.i] n.k), which is in marked contrast to the use of the infinitive of the dedication thatstresses the impersonal character of the donor. The donor never declares \"I present Maat\" but rather he orshe appears \"presenting Maat.\" 226 This is, according to Finnestad (1985: 153-54), related to the respectiverole of man and gods in the offering scenes: the officiant moves in the world of gods, and therefore, thescenes are viewed from the god's perspective. The employment of the scenes of the presentation of Maatexclusively in tombs and temples, rather than as decorative motifs in a domestic context,227 also underscoresthis feature of the offering scenes. The scenes were placed in the realm of the deities, in temples and tombs,because the scenes were considered to be for the gods' consumption and were to be viewed from the gods'perspective.In summary, the inscriptions that narrate the presentation of Maat are not different from those which ac-company the donation of other ritual offerings.228 A better understanding of the scenes of the presentation ofMaat might be gained by reversing our view: although the Maat scenes appear later than many other typesoffering scenes, it is the routine offering scenes that are similar to the scenes of the presentation of Maat.As the symbol or icon of the cosmic order, any individual item offered to the gods was an element of Maat,which is seen at Medinet Habu (P4) and in the descent to the burial chamber in certain royal tombs of theRamesside period (P1-2) where the presentation of nw-vessels is shown in juxtaposition to the offering ofMaat. This association of all offerings with Maat serves as the focus of Chapter XLII of the Berlin ServiceBook, the only extensive liturgy of the presentation of Maat. There the goddess is equated with \"what youeat ... what you drink ... your bread ... your beer ... the fumes of incense which you breathe ... (and) thebreath of your nose ...\" (Moret 1902: 142). In essence, all offerings were, by the Ramesside period, consid-ered to be an aspect of Maat,22 9 and therefore there is virtually no differentiation in the inscriptions of thepresentation of Maat from those that accompany other types of offerings. Maat, as a summary of all offer-ing rituals, was the epitome of offerings, and as Arnold (1962: 44, no. 1) suggests, all other tangible offer-ings are subsumed in the Maat ritual (see also Smith 1994: 79).The equation of Maat and the Ramesside royal name, as reflected in the offering texts, fulfills the com-mitment of mankind to the gods. The ritual indicates that the totality of Egyptian humanity, represented bythe name of the king, who is the corporate personality of the entire population of Egypt, is the offering andis Maat (Frandsen 1989: 100-01). This is confirmed by the recitation of Merneptah in the Osireion: hnm.kwlm m?'t r\" nb hnk.( n.k st \"I am united with Maat every day, I hereby present her to you\" (D2). The royalname equated with Maat could also be seen to serve as an icon for the representative of mankind and infact all Egypt's obligation to the gods. The pre-Ramesside ritual of the offering of Maat symbolized the pre-sentation of all physical offerings, but in the early Ramesside period during the reign of Seti I this iconogra-phy and its associated inscriptions were modified to equate the presentation of Maat with the royal nameand thus to include the entire population of Egypt as represented by the royal name as offerings to the gods.sense of personal identity with a series of offering scenes 227.

Its appearance closely coincideswith other iconographic innovations, such as the representation of the Feast of the Valley, the Opet festival,and scenes of the divine birth.The presentation of the royal name equated with Maat first appears in the reign of Seti I.' The equationof the two rituals is made very clear by their shared iconography and more clearly by the dedication textthat refers to the rebus of the name as Maat.Although the presentation of Maat occurs occasionally on small objects, stelae, and architectural ele-ments, it is depicted most frequently on the walls of Ramesside temples. The scene is found but rarely in theroyal tombs of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties where it shares the iconography of the non-funeraryexamples.Scenes of the offering of Maat do not occur in any predictable sequence in the temple reliefs. Althoughcertain patterns can be perceived, such as the propensity for the scene to be on doorframes and the alterna-tion of nw-vessels with Maat, these patterns are not consistent throughout the entire corpus of temple mate-rial, nor are they unique to scenes of the presentation of Maat. In the royal tombs, the scene with few ex-ceptions appears most commonly in connection with the texts of the Litany of Re and as a double sceneabove the descent to the burial chamber.2Maat, or the royal name equated with the goddess, is always presented to a divinity, never to an indi-vidual or to a king.3 Other gods may act as attendants in whose presence the offering is presented. A widevariety of gods and goddesses act as recipients or as attendants. The identity of the recipient is apparently afunction of the patron deity of the structure in which the scene is employed. For example, in temples dedi-cated to Amun, Amun will be the recipient in the majority of scenes; in the Temple of Khonsu, Khonsu ismore frequently the recipient.The inscriptions that narrate the offering of Maat do not differ in any significant manner from the dedi-cation and recipient's recitations which accompany other types of offerings; hence they do not give muchdirect information about the ritual. However, they do supply valuable information about the overall theol-ogy of such rituals. Scenes of the presentation of Maat, similar to most other types of offering scenes, are intheir most complete form, narrated by a tripartite offering formula. Each of the sections of the formula em-ploys a specific grammatical form that indicates the full content and the sequence of the elements whichmake up a single offering scene.The first action referred to in offering scenes is that of the god. It is, with few exceptions, phrased in thesdm.nf form as df.n(.i) n.k.4 This sdm.nf is identified as nominal by Zabkar, perfect by Wente, and ritual orperformative by Vernus.s In the context of the offering scenes, this phrase refers to divine action that oc-1.

The conclusion that divine action pre-ceded the king's donation is in contrast to the analysis of Nelson, Altenmiiller, Frandsen, and others,6 whohave assumed that the dl.n(.J) n.k formula is the result of the king's actions. The brief phrase that promisesthe most basic qualities (life, dominion, health, years) commemorates the relationship of the king and thegods in that the gods have granted these qualities which allow the pharaoh to exist. In a few examples, thedl.n(.l) n.k \"I have given to you ...\" can be phrased in the circumstantial sdmf in order to narrate more cor-rectly the activity depicted in the offering scene.The second element in the offering inscription is the donor's dedication of the offering that is phrased inthe infinitive. This tense provides a correspondence between the grammar and iconography of the scene be-cause in these scenes the donor is caught in mid-action, hence the infinitive. There is a decided preferencefor the verb hnk to be associated with the presentation of Maat. Other forms that are also used are di, dlt,and rdit (see table 3). Although examples from the Eighteenth Dynasty are not numerous, it appears that inthe Ramesside period hnk is the form most commonly used in scenes of the presentation of Maat and by farthe most common form employed in the dedication of the royal name (table 4).In many offering inscriptions, the dedication is followed by the third element of the offering inscription,i.e., the irf (nf) dl 'nz formula that is conventionally translated as \"may he make given life.\" As noted,this element of the offering formula underwent significant change in the Ramesside period. However, fromits first use in the Middle Kingdom through the Eighteenth Dynasty and again in the Twenty-fifth Dynastyand onward, the subject of r was the donor and hence the phrase emphasized the activity of the donor inthe offering ritual. In the pre- and post-Ramesside periods, the verb ir is a circumstantial form to be trans-lated as \"hereby he (the donor) acts for him (the god), who has given life.\"7As Nims (1975: 76) documents from the scenes recopied for use at Medinet Habu, in the Ramessidephrase rfdl 'nbh the suffix following r refers to the recipient. As Nims also indicates, the phrase during theRamesside era is a clause of purpose: \"in order that he (the god) may act, (he) who has given life (to thedonor).\" The implications of this change are discussed below.SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RITUALROYAL PRESENTATION OF MAATThe royal presentation of Maat could be thought of as an archetypal offering, a supreme offering intowhich all other offerings are subsumed, which is particularly evident from the text of papyrus Berlin 3055dated to the Ramesside period that explicitly associates the presentation of Maat with all other offerings(Moret 1902: 142). This equation of Maat with other offerings is echoed in the epithet of Maat as \"food ofthe gods\" and that the \"gods live on Maat.\"8 She was considered to be the basic sustenance of the gods. Theassociation of Maat with other offerings is also supported by the lack of differentiation of the iconographyand inscriptions of the presentation of Maat scenes from other types of offerings, and by the offering ofwine jars in scenes which specifically state that the action portrayed is the presentation of Maat.9The presentation of Maat also functions as a potent expression of the legitimacy of the king. With theexception of a few figures of quasi-royal status (classes K-L) and a few examples of divine donors,t0 onlythe king (and the queen in the Amarna period) is shown offering Maat in the temple context. He is most fre-quently shown wearing the blue crown that also has connotations of legitimacy.\" The ritual is not infre-quently shown adjacent to scenes of the purification or crowning of the king. The presentation of Maat is a6. Nelson 1949: 344; H. Altenmillier (\"Opfer,\" LA IV, col. 9. See P4, north wall, of the Eighteenth Dynasty temple at581) refers to the s4m.nf as the \"Antwort\"; Frandsen Medinet Habu, wherein Ramesses II presents wine jars(1989: 95) suggests \"to which Re-Harahkti replies: 'I have even though the dedication clearly states dl Mf't n ltf.

The offering of the name which the king assumed at hisaccession to the throne indicates that as a king, rather than as an individual, he not only acknowledges theprinciples of Maat but is also associated with the goddess and indeed is imbued with Maat.The conclusion that the presentation of Maat is a symbol of royal legitimacy could explain why thescene first appears as an iconographic device in the time of Thutmose III. The representation of the ritualcould be a reflection of the king's desire for a deliberate expression of his right to rule. Both the account ofhis divine selection (Breasted 1906a: 55, §§131 ff.) and the first appearance of the scenes of the presenta-tion of Maat date to the later years of his reign.'\" These dual expressions of legitimacy convey the samesentiment as the divine birth scenes of his predecessor, i.e., the confirmation of political rule through ritual.The campaign to desecrate Hatshepsut's monuments that occurred late in the reign of Thutmose III,'4 just asthe scenes of the presentation of Maat and the account of the oracular selection, may be attempts to empha-size his own legitimacy in contrast to that of his predecessor.NON-ROYAL SCENESWith one exception (M9), all examples of the representation of the presentation of Maat with a non-royal donor (pls. 1-5; class M) are from a private mortuary context '1 and fail to exhibit the full iconographyof the royal scenes. The examples from the tomb of Amunwahsu (pl. 1) and the papyrus of Sethnakht (pl. 2)depict the deceased carrying Maat on their uplifted palms, rather than presenting her image to the gods. Al-though the tomb paintings of Irynefer, Amunnakht and the stela of Harsiese (pls. 3-5) share the characteris-tic iconography of a donor offering Maat to a god, these scenes are funerary in nature and are related to theassociation of Maat and Re, or to Maat's role in the justification of the deceased. The single example of thenon-royal presentation of Maat that is not strictly funerary in origin, and thus is differentiated from the othernon-royal examples of the depiction of the presentation of Maat, appears on the front of a statue ofNespekashuty (M9). The appearance of the scene on the statue may well be related to the fact thatNespekashuty was a prophet of Maat (Legrain 1914: 80j), and as related in Chapter XLII of the Berlin Ser-vice Book (Moret 1902: 141-42), a priest could, as deputy for the king, present Maat to Thoth. This role ofa priest acting on behalf of the king suggests that Nespekashuty was not usurping royal prerogatives regard-ing ritual actions.The absence of offering formulas in the private scenes illustrates another significant difference be-tween the royal and non-royal scenes. Since there is no dedication and the gods do not have any recitationrelated to the offering activity, the private scenes do not reflect interaction between the gods and mankindas do their royal counterparts. The royal scenes emphasize the respective actions of both parties through therecitation of the god (dLin[.] n.k), the dedication of the king, and the trf d i 'n formula of the Ramessideperiod. In the private scenes, the deceased merely offers Maat without an indication of a do ut des relation-ship between the donor and the god.'6THE PRESENTATION OF MAAT AND PERSONAL PIETYAssmann suggests that in the Ramesside period, with the rise of personal piety, the common man devel-oped a closer rapport with his god.

This sense of god's will dictating the fate of man is summarized inthe Instruction of Amunemope, which recounts:Do not lie down in fear of tomorrow:Comes day, how will tomorrow be?Man ignores how tomorrow will be;God is ever in his perfection,Man is ever in his failure ...He (the god) seals the verdict with his finger.There is no perfection before the godBut there is failure before him; ..Keep firm your heart, steady your heart,Do not steer with your tongue;If a man's tongue is the boat's rudder,The Lord of All is yet its pilot.18Assmann (1984a: 1 1-14, 232-81; 1980: 22; 1989a: 66-68) proposes that the elimination of Maat as anethical standard is rooted in the Amarna period when the concept of Maat was absorbed into the idea of theAton and into the king himself. During that era, according to Assmann, the devotion of the common folk wasfocused upon the Aton through the king as the intermediary for the Aton; during the Amarna interlude, thepeople acted directly for the king, striving for his praises (hswt), rather than regulating their behavior ac-cording to the age-old principles of Maat. Since the king (and the queen) were the only communicants withthe mute god, loyalty to the Aton exclusively through his intermediary the king, rather than the principles ofMaat, became the rule by which lives were conducted.In the post-Amarna period, there was, according to Assmann, a general reaction against the Amama ex-perience and a diminishing of the king's status due to disillusionment over Akhenaton's exclusive rapportwith the Aton. The spiritual isolation experienced by the population who had access to their god onlythrough the king created a desire to have a direct relationship with their god unencumbered by an interme-diary, be it the king or the ethical code personified by Maat. In the post-Amarna period, again according toAssmann, this resulted in a closeness of man and his god, an attitude of humility and fate and the disasso-ciation between action and result because all was in the \"hands of the god.\" 19 This closeness coincided witha change in tomb decoration. In the Ramesside period, representations of the family and daily life of the de-ceased were generally replaced by scenes related to the search for immortality, such as vignettes from theBook of the Dead (Assmann 1984b: 698-99).Assmann's proposal that personal piety is a result of the Amarna experience does not take into accounttexts which document an individual's direct worship of the Aton nor those which attest to the concept ofMaat as an ethical value.20 Although these texts attest to the king-god association to which Assmann refers,this relationship is not as exclusive as his conclusions might suggest. Two letters of the oil bearer Ramosefrom Amama bear the opening salutation \"Behold I am begging the Aton (1.p.h.) here in Akhetaton (l.p.h.)to keep you well every day, and to cause you to be in favor ....\" 21 On the basis of one of the letters, this re-lationship appears to have been reciprocal because the writer avows that the Aton has given him guidance,not through the intermediary of the king, but directly from god to devotee (Peet 1930: 93 [24], n. 29).Zabkar collected other references to direct veneration of the Aton as well as very pertinent referencesto Maat as an ethical standard from tomb texts at Amama.2 2 In one such text, after Tutu praises the Aton heavows that he has committed no misdeed because \"Maat has made her place in me.\" 23 So, too, Tutu de-clares that \"I have come with praise to Aton, the living and only god ... I have not received reward to lying17. Assmann 1983b: 283-86; idem 1980: 1-32, especially pp. 20.

He places little emphasis uponsources such as temple reliefs.25 One might question to what extent the royal offering inscriptions confirm orconflict with Assmann's proposals about the diminished theological role of the king in the midst of the grow-ing closeness of the man-god relationship.26 Do the scenes of the presentation of Maat support his proposalthat Maat was absorbed into a transcendent god and hence ceased to be an important feature of Egyptianethics in the Ramesside period?The temple reliefs that depict the presentation of Maat do not support the suggestion that there was adramatic change in the conception or veneration of Maat in the Ramesside period as compared to the Eigh-teenth Dynasty. This stability is most evident in the iconography of the offering scenes because the por-trayal of the king offering to the gods does not exhibit any significant change or evolution (with the excep-tion of the innovation of the presentation of the royal name equated with Maat), which might reflect amodification in the underlying theology. Nor does the king assume humble postures (bending or kneelingbefore the god) any more than he did in previous eras.27The presentation of the royal name as Maat is the most evident Ramesside innovation that relates toAssmann's conclusions about personal piety in the Ramesside age. The iconography and the dedication in-scription equate the king's name and hence his entire being with Maat.28 This type of association is hardlyone of humility, which Assmann suggests is a feature of the relationship of the Ramesside king to his god.On the contrary, such an association, unprecedented before the time of Seti I, gives the impression of newvigor and'confidence through the king's affiliation with Maat.The lack of any significant change in the temple offering reliefs from the Eighteenth to the TwentiethDynasty is especially evident in an examination of the offering inscriptions that narrate the rituals. The onlymajor change that is apparent in the Ramesside age is the modification of the Ramesside lrf di tni for-mula, which through the new agreement of the suffix following the verb ir with the god rather than the royaldonor removed any direct reference to the action of the king and emphasized the activity of the god. Onemight argue that this is wholly in keeping with Assmann's conceptions of personal piety, i.e., that the statusof the king was diminished as the sense of god's action's was emphasized.However, this change in the formula must be balanced against other features of the offering inscrip-tions. The first consideration is that other variations of the irf dl 'n6 formula were in use in the Ramessideperiod,29 and with the exception of the specific form lrf d i 'n, the other variations in the formula expressexactly the same relationship of god to donor as in the Eighteenth Dynasty; namely, that the offering ritualis illustrative of the cooperative relationship between god and king.Secondly, any possible diminution of the role of the king evidenced by the agreement of the suffix fol-lowing ir with the god, and hence the emphasis upon the deity, must be balanced against the Ramesside erareinterpretation of the simple irf dl 'nb, because it is this element of the offering inscriptions that reflects achange in the theology between the Eighteenth Dynasty and Ramesside era offering scenes. Rather thanserving as an acknowledgment of the god's initial donation of life (dl.n[.i] n.k), the Ramesside irf dl 'nj\"in order that he (the god) may act (he) who has given life (to the king)\" expresses a true do ut des rela-tionship in the offering scenes, a relationship that binds the actions of the god to the king; the action of theking in some way influences the god to again bestow life upon the pharaoh.24. ,abkar 1954: 94; Sandman 1938: 77.1-2. 26.

This portion of the offering narration suggests that there was a new sense of the king'sability to affect or influence the god's actions. In contrast to the prior era when the king's donation had nobearing upon the activity of the god and the irf di n'n was merely an acknowledgment, in the Ramessideperiod the action of the king was thought to be able to influence the future activity of the god.This sentiment which is diametrically opposed to the ideas inherent in Assmann's personal piety is notrestricted to the offering texts. In the great dedicatory inscription of Ramesses II on the portico of the templeof Seti I at Abydos, the courtiers eulogize the king, equating him with the gods: \"Lord of destiny, creator ofRenenet, Khnum who fashioned the people, giver of breath into the nostrils of all, making all the gods, pillarof heaven, support of earth, [///] adjusting the Two Lands ... maker of the great, fashioner of the lowly,whose word produces food ... .\"o0 In this text, the king and his generative powers are equated with those ofthe gods. Rather than indicating a diminution of the god's ability to affect the fate of the world and theking's passive nature, the Abydos text indicates that the king was considered to play an active role in deter-mining the condition of the world. So, too, the Quban inscription of Ramesses II refers to the ability of theking to achieve seemingly impossible tasks,31 a traditional attribute that is based upon texts of the mid-Eigh-teenth Dynasty.32Assmann concludes that the presentation of Maat became more popular as a theme in temple decora-tion in the Ramesside period due to the king's increasing sense of personal piety and resulting humility.33Assmann (1984b: 697) interprets offering rituals as an indication of the pharaoh's desire to keep the good-will of the gods through his activity for them. Hence perhaps according to Assmann's suggestions, the offer-ing of Maat could be seen as an act of humility in the performance of which the king holds up Maat as ameans of assuring the unpredictable god of his willingness to rule according to the moral precepts inherentin Maat. However, the temple scenes simply do not support this interpretation. As stated, the scenes do notdocument any increase in humble postures before the god, and the Ramesside era irfdi 'nh suggests therewas a new stronger association between the action of king and god. Further, the new association of theking's name with Maat cannot be construed as being indicative of a weak king but rather of a new confi-dence and association with the gods.In summary, there is no evidence from the temple offering reliefs and accompanying inscriptions tosuggest that the king's sense of personal piety was an important aspect of Ramesside religion. Further,Assmann's suggestion that the Ramesside situation which is characterized by the diminution of the king'srole as a result of his sole contact with the Aton and by the decline of Maat in the Amarna period should bereevaluated in light of references to Maat and to hymns to the disk in that era. There is no evidence thatconfirms or even suggests that Maat ceased to be an important feature of Ramesside religion. On the con-trary, the great number of examples of the presentation of Maat that decorate so many Ramesside monu-ments-especially those scenes located in areas of public appeal to the gods-attest to the emphasis placedupon the goddess who according to Assmann (1984b: 696; 1989a: 73, §b) had been reduced from a moralcode to a sense of meaningless social solidarity. On the contrary, in this period, as in the Eighteenth Dy-nasty, the temple relief record suggests that Maat was associated with the king's legitimacy and power andhis ability to rule in accordance with the precepts of Maat. The emphasis put upon Maat in the royal sphereis further evidenced by the presentation of the royal name equated with the goddess, a ritual that appearsfirst in the time of Seti I. This rite stressed not the humility of the king before the god but rather the king'sdirect association with the goddess and the continuing importance of Maat.PERSONAL PIETY AND THE COMMON MANHow do the scenes of the presentation of Maat accord with Assmann's (1984b: 678-702) conclusionsthat the common man no longer revered Maat as an ethical concept? Certainly, personal piety is manifested30. Breasted 1906b: 108, 1265 = KRI II, 326 = Assmann 1975: 32. Breasted 1906b: 120, note a.495. 33. Assmann 1980: 27; see also Hornung 1982: 211-12. For31.

However, the evidence doesnot support Assmann's conclusion that closeness to god automatically excluded veneration of Maat. Maathad an undiminished and even expanded presence in non-royal religion of the Ramesside period. This im-portance of Maat is manifested not only in the great number of scenes of the presentation of Maat that ap-pear in the major temples, sections of which were places of worship for the common man, but also in scenesof the offering of her image that appear in certain Ramesside private tombs (MI-4). Although there aretextual references to individuals holding, elevating, or presenting Maat (R2, 4-6; M5) prior to the Nine-teenth Dynasty, with one exception (M5) all such representations date to the Ramesside period (MI-4) orearly Third Intermediate Period (M8);34 the era when, according to Assmann, Maat ceased to be an impor-tant ethical concept. The examples of the presentation of Maat from private tombs are augmented by agreat number of textual references to the goddess, her appearance in Ramesside tomb scenes, and the greatnumber of new epithets for the goddess that were generated in that era.\" The many attestations of Maat,both as literary allusions and tomb representations, are in direct conflict with Assmann's conclusions thatMaat was no longer an important feature of Ramesside private religion.The hymns and wisdom literature (such as Amunemope) do indicate that the concept of Maat under-went a fundamental change. However, although her importance as an ethical concept may have beeneroded or that a sense of the willfulness of the gods was held by some of the population, the emphasis putupon Maat-related themes in temple and tomb iconography indicates that generally her role was broadenedand redefined rather than strictly eroded. As a result of this redefinition, two distinct yet related conceptionsof Maat evolved in the Ramesside period; one that pertains to royal religion and function and the other tonon-royal beliefs.MAAT IN NON-ROYAL RAMESSIDE RELIGIONThe appearance of Maat in tomb paintings, the presentation of her image in private tombs, the prolif-eration of funerary epithets, and new syncretistic associations for the goddess36 date to the same era inwhich Assmann concludes that Maat no longer is relevant to popular beliefs. This prominence of Maatstrongly argues for an increased interest in the goddess rather than a decline in her influence. Her presence,especially in the scenes of the deceased offering Maat, signifies that the goddess was still revered by thesame Thebans whose letters and hymns formed the basis of Assmann's thesis. The iconographic innovationof the private presentation scenes also indicates a new interest in the representation of Maat-related beliefsthat earlier had been restricted to textual references.The Ramesside emphasis upon Maat in the non-royal sources are, with the exception of the statue ofNespekashuty (M9), from the funerary context. Although Maat was associated with funerary beliefs sincethe Old Kingdom,37 the goddess became more closely associated with the mortuary realm in the Ramessideperiod; it was in this context that Maat was especially revered by the common people. This funerary role ofMaat is reflected in many of the hymns upon which Assmann based his conclusions because in the lateEighteenth Dynasty and in the Ramesside period there was a close association of Re and Maat.38 For ex-ample, the sun hymn of Neferhotep (RI 1) invokes Maat and specifically refers to the deceased presentingMaat to the rising sun.39 In this context as well, Maat functions within her funerary role and in contrast toAssmann this indicates an emphasis upon Maat, not a diminution of her role.The mortuary role of Maat in the Ramesside period is attested most clearly in her association with'Imntt, the goddess of the West. This affiliation manifests itself most clearly in the early Nineteenth Dy-nasty o by the many funerary epithets and terms that are applied to, or associated with, Maat. Among these34. One additional example (M9) dates to the Twenty-sixth 38. See, for example, the indices in Assmann 1969, 1983a,Dynasty (Nespekashuty), a period upon which Assmann and 1990: 160-99 for many references to Maat in the con-does not specifically comment, text of the sun hymns.35.

In other sources, there appears tobe an overall conflation of Maat and the West, perhaps due to their shared feather emblem.49 In theRamesside period, the feather, which the goddesses share and which can ambiguously stand for either deity,is represented as a symbol that is touched to the face of the deceased to ensure revitalization.Maat is associated with other funerary gods in Ramesside mortuary texts. She acts as a recipient of in-cense along with Re-Horakhty, Osiris-Wennefer, Isis, Mut, and the Greater and Lesser Enneads.The funerary aspect of Maat in the Ramesside period is also attested by htp dl nsw formulas. Duringthat time, Maat, or Maat in conjunction with other deities, is invoked among the gods who will provide forthe deceased in the afterlife.5\" Maat's association with funerary offerings is also confirmed by a referenceto her in the Song of the Harper in the tomb of Paser: M 't difs(t) fr.k wnn.t hnkt irp mdt ... n.k \"Maat, heplaces her before you, that [you shall have] bread, beer, wine, and ointment\" (KRI III, 8.7).

These might appear singly, in pairs, or double pairs.52Maat feathers appear frequently as emblems upon private coffins of the Twenty-first Dynasty.53 Onsuch coffins, Isis and Nephthys, the traditional mourners for the deceased, may carry Maat feathers.14 Cof-fins from the Twenty-first Dynasty also show Maat feathers in other purely mortuary settings, such as in thehands of figures who offer to the ba of the deceased.\" The four sons of Horus are occasionally shown withMaat feathers in their hands.'6 This use of Maat emblems in the funerary context continues onward into thelater period and is attested in the Saite period Tomb of Tjaty (QI3), in which the Maat feather is associatedwith the god Anubis.57The appearance of IJft-hr-nb.s, a female deity whose head is in the form of a Maat feather (or the signfor the West), is another indication of the funerary emphasis of Maat in popular religion of the Ramessideera.s8 This goddess is shown on coffins and funerary papyri of the Ramesside period.59 On coffins, her ac-tion is described as di.s htpw dfw n Wsir ... \"She gives offerings and provisions to the Osiris ... \"; she canalso appear in the place of Maat in scenes of the judgment of the deceased.6°As demonstrated, emphasis upon Maat in the mortuary realm is well attested through both textual refer-ences and iconography in the Ramesside period, casting doubt upon Assmann's assertion that Maat was nolonger an important ethical feature in religion of that period. Perhaps as Assmann suggested, the goddessMaat no longer provided the only standards by which man conducted his life. However, the funerary em-phasis upon Maat in Ramesside religion suggests that the goddess did not decline in importance, but that thepopular conception and relevance of the goddess had shifted from primarily an ethical concept that was astandard of human behavior, to a funerary concept. In this funerary realm, her earlier role in the judgmentof the deceased was broadened to emphasize her role as a goddess with wide-ranging mortuary associa-tions. This new prominence in the funerary realm explains her continued incorporation into Ramesside non-royal iconography in a period when, according to Assmann, her primary role as an ethi'cal concept had beeneffaced by the rise of personal piety. In essence, her role in private religion was modified to express not hertraditional role in the regulation of human behavior, but her role in the necropolis and the afterlife.ROYAL CONCEPTIONS OF MAATThe continuing importance of Maat in royal religion is manifested in the many scenes of the presenta-tion of her image on the walls of Ramesside period temples. Scenes of the presentation of Maat serve asproclamations of the king's legitimacy, a conclusion that is reached not only by the prominent placement ofthe scene in public areas of the temple,6' but also by the nearly universal appearance of the king as the do-nor of Maat.62The ritual expresses the association of the king and Maat, hence of the king's cognizance of52.

The presentation of the name assumed upon the accession to the throne equated withMaat is another indication of the ritual's association with legitimacy. In such scenes the king's name, whichin the Ramesside period is often compounded with Maat, is through the dedication inscription directly asso-ciated with the goddess. Both the offering of Maat and the royal name stress the relationship between theking and the gods; the gods have granted the king life, so the king gives the incarnation of the principles ofstatecraft to the deityAssmann's assertion that the god-king relationship changed in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynastiesas a result of the diminished role of Maat does not accord with the evidence provided by the scenes of thepresentation of Maat. On the contrary, the ritual scenes provide the strongest argument against Assmann'ssuggestion that Maat was no longer an important religious concept in the Ramesside period.Foremost, the iconography of the royal offering of Maat does not display any significant change fromthe Eighteenth Dynasty to the Ramesside period. Furthermore, if, as Assmann suggests, Maat was no longeran important ethical concept that guided man's behavior in the Ramesside period, one might expect repre-sentations of her to occur less frequently as a theme in tomb and temple decoration. On the contrary, a newemphasis upon Maat-related iconography can be documented by scenes of the presentation of Maat in pri-vate tombs and by the great proliferation of scenes of the presentation of her image in temples. The offeringof the name equated with Maat that dates to the reign of Seti I also indicates a desire to expand the reper-toire of Maat-related iconography.The significance of the scenes of the presentation of her image does not appear to change from theEighteenth to the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties. In both eras, the representations on the greattemples functioned not only as an affirmation of royal legitimacy, but also as a symbol of the power of theking for the common people who visited the temples. The appearance of the scene at sites of popular suppli-cation confirms that the ritual was intended to express the legitimacy of the king and his association withMaat to the populace, and that symbolically the king in conjunction with Maat was responsible for grantingpetitions and responding to prayer.6 3 My.liwiec (1985a: 9) comes close to the mark when he likens thescenes of the presentation of Maat to scenes of political propaganda, although the word \"propaganda\" ischarged with deliberate deception that does not apply to the ancient situation. The scenes of the presenta-tion of Maat in the temples were a visible affirmation of the king's ability to rule in accordance with the tra-ditions of statecraft that were associated with the religious concepts embodied in Maat.The evidence from a study of the presentation of Maat and of the name equated with Maat strongly at-tests not only to the continuation of the pre-Ramesside association of the king and Maat, but also to a newemphasis upon the role of Maat in relationship to kingship in the Ramesside era. Simultaneously, Maatachieved a new prominence in the funerary beliefs of the common man. Rather than confirming Assmann'ssuggestion of a diminution of the role of Maat, both temple and tomb reliefs attest to Maat's importance intwo distinct spheres of interest. The royal conception of Maat expressed the equation of the goddess and theking's legitimacy and the ability of the king to rule in accordance with the age-old precepts of Maat. Thesecond conception is that documented by the increase of Maat-related themes in private funerary beliefs. Inessence, personal piety of the Ramesside period was not incompatible with continuing and even accentu-ated veneration of Maat.EXCURSUS: THE PRESENTATION OF THE ROYAL NAME AND THESTATUS OF THE RAMESSIDE KING AND MAATDoes the ritual of the presentation of the royal name equated with Maat relate in any way to Assmann'sconclusions about the changing conception of Ramesside kingship or to the conception of Maat in theRamesside period? The representation of the ritual of the presentation of the royal name directly associatedwith Maat occurs first in the time of Seti I, which indicates that the ritual may have some bearing uponAssmann's proposed changes in Ramesside theology. Rossler-K6hler (1985: 939-41,944) suggests that the63.

More recently, Frandsen (1989: 103) states that the name of the king was associated with Maat for\"the major part of the New Kingdom.\" Considering these variant views, it is useful to examine how far be-fore the Ramesside period the ritual of the presentation of the royal name equated with Maat can be traced,and what, if any, implications does the ritual have for the relationship of Maat and the king in theRamesside era.VARIATIONS IN THE PRESENTATION OF THE NAME TO THE GODSThere are three variations in the ritual that portrays the royal name presented to the gods.TYPE 1The earliest variation in the ritual, here called Type I, is first attested in the time of Amunhotep III (pl.16). In this type of representation, the king presents his own name enclosed in cartouches to the god.65There is no equation of the offering with Maat either by dedication inscription or through the composition ofthe name as a rebus that emphasizes Maat.66 This sort of ritual continues to be attested in the later Eigh-teenth Dynasty by objects recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun.67 Type I scenes of the presentation ofthe royal name continue to be a theme in Ramesside iconography.68 The offering in such a ritual is most of-ten in the form of one or two ornate vessels that the king dedicates to the god. These may or may not takethe form of name rebuses and may or may not be enclosed in cartouches. A non-rebus form appears amongthe reliefs in the Treasury of Medinet Habu (MH V, pl. 333); rebus examples are attested by several statuesin Cairo that represent the king presenting his name to Amun.69 A further development of the offering of arebus of the king's name not equated with Maat is attested in the reliefs of Ramesses IV at the Temple ofKhonsu.70 These scenes resemble Type 3 of the Ramesside period in their emphasis upon the Maathieroglyph in the rebus (see below), although the rebus is not, by means of the dedication or by the absenceof a dedication, equated with Maat. In an exceptional example from the reliefs of Ramesses IV at theKhonsu Temple the dedication specifically states that the rebus, although dominated by the Maathieroglyph is the rn wr \"great name\" (pl. 12, F18) rather than Maat.TYPE 2The second type of name presentation is unique to the Amarna period. In that era, the king or the queenoffers the names of the Aton rather than the royal names. The recipient is the god himself.7' As with Type 1,the name does not take the form of a rebus but rather the names appear as the normal full writing, enclosedin cartouches that are usually poised on a flat base or, less frequently, on a nb-shaped base.72The dedica-64.

This type of name presentation ritual occurs with considerable frequency in the Ramessideperiod. Type 3 of the ritual may involve a rebus of the king's prenomen (classes F-G), or less frequently,nomen (HI, 3). In all examples, the rebus is presented by the king to a god, and in classes F and G the Maathieroglyph is, with the exception noted below, the dominant feature of the offering, so much so that thescene may be mistaken for the presentation of Maat rather than of the royal name. In a double scene fromthe High Gate at Medinet Habu that depicts the king presenting his prenomen (F12) and his nomen (HI),the Maat hieroglyph is a minor element in the rebus of the prenomen, while the nomen does not even incor-porate the hieroglyph for Maat. Yet both scenes bear the dedication hnk m M 't n itfTHE THEOLOGY OF THE OFFERING OF THE NAMEEach type of the offering of the royal name reflects a specific relationship between the donor and di-vine recipient.Type 1, the offering of the royal names to the god, invokes the king's sense of piety to the god, and per-haps a dedication of himself, symbolized by his name, and his efforts on behalf of the god.74 The single ex-ample from the reign of Amunhotep III (pl. 16) is, as indicated by the rebus of the vessel upon which thecartouches stand, a request to the god for an acclamation of \"millions of years of stability for kingAmunhotep III.\" In the case of the Ramesside examples, with few exceptions (F8, I1, 17; G2-3; H3) thename is dedicated to Amun, the \"state god,'\"7 suggesting that the king offers his name and thus himself toefforts of statecraft.76Type 2 scenes from the Amarna period commemorate the veneration of the Aton by the king andqueen. In such scenes, the king or the queen elevates the names of the god to his visible manifestation, thesun disk. With these scenes, as in Type 1, there is no equation between the donation and the goddess Maat.However, two exceptional scenes from Amarna reflect a variation in the theology of the presentation ofthe name. In the tomb of Ipy at Amarna, the king elevates an offering consisting of the cartouches of theAton, flanked by standing figures who wear the uraeus and who are therefore identified with the king.These male figures also wear three feathers on their head.77 The multiple Maat feathers suggest that in thisscene, it is the king who is associated with Maat rather than the offering (Teeter 1985/86).On the second document, a fragment of a parapet from Amama, the Aton's names are elevated by anintermediary figure of the queen (identified by a single uraeus) who, like Maat, squats on a nb-sign (Aldred1973, no. 18). The pose of the female figure as well as the multiple feathers which appear on her head sug-gest that, as in the tomb of Ipy, the queen is assimilated to the role of, or otherwise associated with, Maat.78In this scene, the usual \"nh-sign that is held by Maat is replaced by the names of the life-giving Aton. Theiconography of these two anomalous scenes equates not the name that is offered with Maat, but the donor(king or queen) with Maat.The distinctive feature of Type 3 scenes of the Ramesside period is the specific equation of the rebuswith Maat, which is made very clear by the dedication that takes the form hnk M?'t n ... \"presenting Maat73.

Such scenes unequivocally equate the name and the king himself with Maat.9 With fewexceptions (class H), it is the prenomen, the name which was assumed upon succession to the throne80 andwhich more frequently than not in the Ramesside period includes the element \"Maat,\" that is presented tothe gods. This ritual thus stresses the legitimacy of the king and his commitment to rule in accordance withthe precepts of Maat, the substance \"upon which the gods live.\"It is only in the Type 3 scenes of the Ramesside period that there is any direct evidence for the associa-tion of Maat with the ritual presentation of the name. Type 1 scenes, which originate in the Eighteenth Dy-nasty, as indicated above, continue through the Ramesside period and do not evolve into Type 3 rituals assuggested by Frandsen.8' So, too, the dissimilarities of the iconography and theology of Type 2, in which thename of the Aton is presented to the Aton, to Type 3 (direct equivalence between Maat and the royalname) puts R6ssler-Kbhler's suggestions in doubt.In summary, the Ramesside era presentation of the royal name equated with Maat (Type 3) is an inno-vation of the Ramesside period, which is indicated most clearly by the fact that Type I scenes continuethrough the Ramesside period, during which era Type 3 scenes also appear, suggesting that the Type 1 andType 3 rituals served different and distinct purposes.How does this summary of the varieties of the ritual of the presentation of the name pertain to the ques-tion of the status of the king in the Ramesside period? The appearance of Type 3 in the early Ramesside pe-riod, and not before, indicates that the ritual fulfilled a desire to express a new role or dimension for theRamesside pharaoh. The ritual stressed his new relationship with Maat and his commitment to the gods.This further development of Maat-related theology as reflected by the iconography expresses an enhancedinterest in Maat and is another manifestation of the Ramesside era interest in the deity. The association ofthe king with Maat through the equation of Maat and the royal name does not support Assmann's (1980: 1-32; 1983b: 283-85; 1984a: 227-28, 264-65; 1984b: 687-701; 1989a: 72-82) assertion that Maat ceased tobe an important feature of Ramesside religion, rather it attests to an enhanced interest in Maat. Rather thanbeing a symbol of humility resulting from a decline in the influence of the ruler that Assmann proposes forkings of the Ramesside period, the ritual may be viewed as a symbol of confidence, of a new direct associa-tion with the world of the gods.79.
