The Mass' complexity is openonly to those who dare to plunge time and timeagain into its mysterious depths. On the otherhand, the Mass' sublimity is accessible to all: atleast to all who can go beyond simply “being atMass” to engaging in the Mass, to becoming partof the archetypal drama that unfolds with eachcelebration. Then, enfolded in its sublimity, wemay hear its mystic callings: Its Law proclaimsthe Liberty of All. Its Beauty emanates the Loveof perfect Understanding. Its Ecstasy celebratesthe Sacrament of Life. Its Mysteries containunending unfoldings of the Light. For those whohave allowed themselves to participateconsciously in the Gnostic Mass – knowing it tobe the sacred manifestation of the Infinite, theEternal piercing the temporal – they know wellits sublimity. And if the Gnostic Mass' sublimityunlocks the Heart, its unfathomable complexityand depth ignite the Mind.TFor those interested in understandingsymbolism, the Gnostic Mass is a veritabletreasure trove. Every little bit of the Mass is arabbit hole that often goes far deeper than onemight expect. An entire book could (andshould!) be written simply on the connectionsbetween Wagner's Parsival and the GnosticMass, or the meaning of the Words AUMGNand IAO as they are used in the Mass, or theformula of Tetragrammaton as expressedthroughout the Mass, and many other things.The depth of potential objects of study andcontemplation is truly unfathomable. Along with the immense amount ofpossible subjects, there is a correspondingamount of contemporary Thelemites who areengaging with this work. This special issue ofThe Journal of Thelemic Studies is a showcase ofa wide variety of writings on the Gnostic Mass. Itis meant to be a compendium of various ideasfor interested students, as well as a testament tothe lively growth of the Thelemic current. Puttingthis issue together was a special treat to me, as Isaw that so many people were zealouslyenthusiastic about the Mass. There is simply notenough space to contain all the exciting newwriting and other work around the Mass that ishappening across the entire globe.

In1939, he founded an eclectic esoteric societycalled the Order of Holy Wisdom, whichclaimed to teach the hidden knowledge of thesacred traditions of all nations, past and present.Crow became an author late in his life, andproduced such titles as A History of Magic,Witchcraft and Occultism [1968], PreciousStones: Their Occult Power and HiddenSignificance [1968], The Occult Properties ofHerbs [1969], and The Arcana of Symbolism[1979].Crow's interest in the Liberal CatholicChurch led him, in 1943, to be consecrated inthe Syrian-Antiochene (Ferrette) succession ofepiscopi vagantes by the Rt. Rev. James Heard.Crow then, as Mar Basilius Abdullah III, claimedthe title of “Sovereign Prince Patriarch ofAntioch.” This consecration provided many newopportunities for Crow, and he began to expandhis influence. In April 1944, he passed hisApostolic lineage on to Hugh George deWillmott Newman, who then, as Mar Georgius I,claimed the titles of Metropolitan of Glastonburyand Catholicos of the West. Around the time ofNewman's consecration, Crow sent Crowleysome of his pamphlets, which initiated Crowley'scorrespondence with him. Crowley, of course,sought to enlist Crow's aid in establishing theLaw of Thelema and in promoting O.T.O. andespecially E.G.C., and Crow seemed, at least atfirst, to be interested; although it is unknownwhether Crow ever actually became an initiate.There are no surviving records of his initiation,and as late as May 1947, Crowley was suggestingthat Crow send his followers to Gerald Gardnerto be initiated in O.T.O.Two documents pertaining to Crow'srelationship to O.T.O. and E.G.C. have beencirculated in recent years by individuals whooppose the current leadership of O.T.O. One ofthese documents is purported to be Crow's claimto have been duly “elected” as head of the Ritesof Memphis and Mizraim and the OrientalTemplar Order in 1948, “in accordance with theconstitution and regulations” of the Order, and tohave relegated these rites to a sub-division of hisown Order of Holy Wisdom. This documentmakes no mention of Aleister Crowley,Theodore Reuss, or Carl Kellner, or of anythingpertaining to Thelema. The document advocatesa restoration the original doctrines of the KnightsTemplars, and it eschews affiliation with anyOriental Templar groups that do not adhere tothese original doctrines. In his A History ofMagic, Witchcraft and Occultism, Crow makes itclear that he does not believe that the originaldoctrines of the Templars included any teachingsregarding sexual magic.The Journal of Thelemic Studies4The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Now, Crowley's documented successor ashead of O.T.O. was, of course, Karl Germer.Also, the Constitution of O.T.O. does notprescribe election as the mechanism ofsuccession to the office of O.H.O. Furthermore,before Crow's death in 1976, all authority, title,succession, and archives related to the Order ofHoly Wisdom was deeded to his successorW.H.H. Newman-Norton, Mar Seraphim,Metropolitan of the British Orthodox Church.According to correspondence with MarSeraphim's representative in 1995, Mar Seraphimhimself makes no claim of any control over OrdoTempli Orientis, and is personally unaware ofany claim of Crow to have succeeded AleisterCrowley as O.H.O. of O.T.O. Since Crow neveractively asserted any claim to authority in O.T.O.during his lifetime, and evidently passed no suchauthority on to his successor, the significance ofthis document, if any, is moot.The other document purports to beAleister Crowley's appointment of Crow asPatriarch of the Thelemic E.G.C., dated August1944, the same date as the original, rough draftof the Manifesto. This document (which, to myknowledge, is unsigned) contains a number ofstriking stylistic similarities to Crow's originaldraft of the Manifesto, but there is no copy of itto be found in the correspondence archive thatwas made available to O.T.O., nor is there anymention of it, or even any allusion to it, in any ofthe letters therein, including the two letters fromCrowley dated August 1944. The letters in thearchive contain considerable discussion of theManifesto, and one must wonder why such animportant document as a Letter of Patriarchalappointment would go completely unmentioned.Even if this document were valid, which is farfrom certain, it does not include any statement ofabdication of supreme authority in E.G.C., nordoes it include any indication that the rightsbestowed are, in any way, exclusive. It would,therefore, have constituted an appointment of asubordinate, possibly one of several such. Crownever attempted to activate E.G.C. in England,and never attempted to assert control over itelsewhere, so the significance of this document (ifany) is as moot as that of the other document.“...the time has come for the administration ofthe Sacraments...”Crow's original text read, “The time hascome for High Initiates to administer theSacraments of the Æon of Horus to thosecapable of comprehension.” On Crowley's proofcopy, he struck out the words “for High Initiates”and wrote in the margin, “I always dislikedragging in these claims. Besides, quite lowinitiates can do this work.”Interestingly, the words “the time hascome for High Initiates to administer theSacraments of the Age of Horus” occur in Crow'salleged Patriarchal appointment document --virtually the same words that Crowley purposelystruck from Crow's draft of the manifesto. Onecan only speculate as to why Crowley wouldhave made this correction in one document butnot in the other.Love is the law, love under will.The Journal of Thelemic Studies5The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Purpose of the Gnostic Massby Frater IaonDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.“Nor is it given to any son of manTo hymn that Sacrament, the One in Seven,Where God and priest and worshiper,Deacon, asperger, thurifer, chorister,Are one as they were one ere time began,Are one on earth as they are one in heaven;Where the soul is given a new name,Confirming with an oath the same,And with celestial wine and breadIs most delicately fed.”–Aleister Crowley, “The Sevenfold Sacrament” 1he Gnostic Mass – also known as “LiberXV: Ecclesiæ Gnosticæ CatholicæCanon Missæ”2 or the Canon of theGnostic Catholic Church – was written byAleister Crowley in 1913 to be used by EcclesiaGnostic Catholica, the ecclesiastical arm of OrdoTempli Orientis. Though it is similar in someways to the Mass of previous churches, it iswritten to conform with the Law of the NewAeon, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole ofthe Law.”3 Crowley wrote in his Confessionsabout the Mass:T“Human nature demands (in the case ofmost people) the satisfaction of thereligious instinct, and, to very many, thismay best be done by ceremonial means. Iwished therefore to construct a ritual1Found in The Equinox III:1, also known as “The BlueEquinox.”2The text can be found in The Equinox III:1 and III:10 aswell as most copies of Liber ABA.3Liber AL, I:40.through which people might enter intoecstasy as they have always done underthe influence of appropriate ritual. Inrecent years, there has been an increasingfailure to attain this object, because theestablished cults shock their intellectualconvictions and outrage their commonsense. Thus their minds criticize theirenthusiasm; they are unable toconsummate the union of their individualsouls with the universal soul as abridegroom would be to consummate hismarriage if his love were constantlyreminded that its assumptions wereintellectually absurd. I resolved that myRitual should celebrate the sublimity ofthe operation of universal forces withoutintroducing disputable metaphysicaltheories. I would neither make nor implyany statement about nature which wouldnot be endorsed by the most materialisticman of science. On the surface this maysound difficult; but in practice I found itperfectly simple to combine the mostrigidly rational conceptions of phenomenawith the most exalted and enthusiasticcelebration of their sublimity.” 4 From this quotation we can see severalelements of Crowley's intention behind writingthis ritual: (1) Humanity requires a way to satisfythe religious instinct, which may be doneceremonially. (2) The ritual should allow peopleto enter into ecstasy. (3) The ritual should4Confessions, chapter 73.The Journal of Thelemic Studies6The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"celebrate the sublimity of the operation ofuniversal forces. (4) The ritual should not shockour intellectual convictions or outrage ourcommon sense. (5) It should not introducedisputable metaphysical theories nor imply anystatement about nature that would not beendorsed by a scientist. Crowley also wrote:“The world needs religion. Religion mustrepresent Truth, and celebrate it. Thistruth is of two orders: one, concerningNature external to Man; two, concerningNature internal to Man. Existing religions,especially Christianity, are based onprimitive ignorance of the facts,particularly of external Nature.Celebrations must conform to the customand nature of the people. Christianity hasdestroyed the joyful celebrations,characterized by music, dancing, feasting,and making love; and has kept only themelancholy. The Law of Thelema offers areligion which fulfills all necessaryconditions.” 5This quotation also gives furtherinformation: (1) An affirmation of the need tosatisfy the religious instinct. (2) Religion shouldrepresent and celebrate Truth of both internaland external Nature. (3) Previous religions(specifically Christianity) are ignorant of Truth,especially of external Nature. (4) Religiouscelebrations must conform to the custom andnature of the people. (5) The New Aeon requiresjoyful celebrations characterized by music,dancing, feasting, and making love, notcelebrations characterized by melancholy sincewe acknowledge that “Existence is pure joy.”6We can see that there is a consistentintention behind the Gnostic Mass:5The Equinox III:1, “Editorial.” 6Liber AL vel Legis II:9.Its Rationale: •Humanity requires a way to satisfy thereligious instinct, which may be doneceremonially. Its Purpose: •The ritual should allow people to enterinto ecstasy. •The ritual should celebrate the sublimityof the operation of universal forces.•The ritual should represent and celebrateTruth of both internal and externalNature.The Proper Attitude:•The ritual should be a joyful celebration,not melancholic. (“Existence is pure joy...Let the rituals be rightly performed withjoy & beauty!”7).Cautions: •The ritual must celebrate Truthaccurately.•The ritual should not shock ourintellectual convictions or outrage ourcommon sense. •It should not introduce disputablemetaphysical theories nor imply anystatement about nature that would not beendorsed by a scientist. Aside from this, there are otherconsiderations which help to illuminate thepurpose of the Gnostic Mass. Firstly, the GnosticMass serves a practical purpose of being theprimary public interface of the Order (theO.T.O.). It is celebrated publicly at virtuallyevery O.T.O. body on a regular basis and isoften the first event or contact that newcomershave with the Order. In this way, it serves to (a)7Liber AL vel Legis II:9, II:35. The Journal of Thelemic Studies7The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"introduce outsiders to the Order, (b) display itsMysteries in veiled symbolism insofar as itconceals the IX° secret8, and (c) satisfy thereligious instinct of the people throughceremonial means that is accessible to everyoneinsofar as it is a public ritual. Secondly, the Gnostic Mass is aEucharistic ritual. Crowley counsels, “Neglect notthe daily Miracle of the Mass, either by the Riteof the Gnostic Catholic Church, or that of thePhoenix.”9 This “Miracle of the Mass” is theEucharist, celebrated in both “the Rite of theGnostic Catholic Church,” i.e. the Gnostic Mass,as well as “that of the Phoenix,” meaning “Liber44: The Mass of the Phoenix.”10 This “Miracle ofthe Mass” is mentioned within the Gnostic Massitself in the Creed that is recited at the beginningof the ritual, “And, forasmuch as meat and drinkare transmuted in us daily into spiritualsubstance, I believe in the Miracle of the Mass.”The Mass as a Eucharistic ritual is therefore atransmutation of material into spiritual substance.As the Master Therion explains:“One of the simplest and most completeof Magick ceremonies is the Eucharist. Itconsists in taking common things,transmuting them into things divine, andconsuming them. So far, it is a type ofevery magick ceremony, for thereabsorption of the force is a kind ofconsumption; but it has a more restrictedapplication, as follows. Take a substance8“The Gnostic Mass is the central ceremony, both public andprivate, of the O.T.O. The reason that it is the centralceremony of the O.T.O. is simply because it is the ritualizedenactment of the Order's supreme Secret of magick. ThatSecret emanates from the Sovereign Sanctuary of theGnosis, the Ninth degree.” –Lon Milo DuQuette IX°,Archbishop of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, in the “Miracleof the Mass” segment of Speech in the Silence, a podcast onThelema: <http://www.speechinthesilence.com>9Liber Aleph, chapter 16 “De Cultu.”10The text of this ritual can be found in The Book of Lies,chapter 44.symbolic of the whole course of nature,make it God, and consume it... Themagician becomes filled with God, fedupon God, intoxicated with God. Little bylittle his body will become purified by theinternal lustration of God; day by day hismortal frame, shedding its earthlyelements, will become in very truth theTemple of the Holy Ghost. Day by daymatter is replaced by Spirit, the human bythe divine; ultimately the change will becomplete; God manifest in flesh will behis name.” 11It should be abundantly clear thatEucharistic magick was held in high regard byCrowley and seen as being of supremeimportance. Crowley gives a further explanation:“Our spiritual consciousness acts throughthe will and its instruments upon materialobjects, in order to produce changeswhich will result in the establishment ofthe new conditions of consciousnesswhich we wish. That is the definition ofMagick. The obvious example of such anoperation in its most symbolic andceremonial form is the Mass. The will ofthe priest transmutes a wafer in such wisethat it becomes charged with the divinesubstance in so active a form that itsphysical injection gives spiritualnourishment to the communicant.” 12Essentially, the Eucharistic ritual of theMass in its most basic form involves thetransmutation of material into divine substancewhich is then consumed, filling the communicantwith God and leading eventually to thecommunicant becoming God (“God manifest inflesh will be his name” as the previous quotation11Magick in Theory & Practice, chapter 20 “Of the Eucharistand of the Art of Alchemy.”12Confessions, chapter 14.The Journal of Thelemic Studies8The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"states). By understanding the purpose of this ritualand celebrating it as it was intended by itsauthor, we may engage in its Mysteries moreconsciously. In this way, our bodies may beenergized by the Eucharistic elements that havebeen transformed into spiritual substance, ourminds may be guided by our knowledge andunderstanding of this gnostic rite, and the flamesof our spirit may be kindled to be consumed inTruth, for this ritual may lead us to that certainspiritual consciousness whereby we mayproclaim that we are the Truth.Love is the law, love under will.© 2014 Golden Lotus Lodge, O.T.O., Garden Grove, CaliforniaThe Journal of Thelemic Studies9The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Conditions for Eucharistic Magickby Tau PolyphilusDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.“With regard to the preparations for such Sacraments, the Catholic Church hasmaintained well enough the traditions of the true Gnostic Church in whose keeping thesecrets are. Chastity is a condition; fasting for some hours previous is a condition; anearnest and continual aspiration is a condition. Without these antecedents even theEucharist of the One and Seven is partially — though such is its intrinsic virtue that itcan never be wholly — baulked of its effect.” —Aleister Crowley, Magick: Book Fourhese conditions are given as applicableto any Eucharistic magick whatsoever.They would be pertinent to the laycommunicant in the Gnostic Mass, just as well asthe priest. They would also apply to the Mass ofthe Phoenix and other magical operations inwhich the procedure “consists in taking commonthings, transmuting them into things divine, andconsuming them.”13TNote that when Crowley writes of “theCatholic Church,” he is indicating the Church ofRome in the early years of the first Thelemiccentury. He is therefore referencing the traditionsmaintained prior to the Second Vatican Council,which voided or marginalized some of the ritualtraditions supporting that church’s Eucharist. In afootnote to the text above, Crowley also instructsthe student to consult “the Roman Missal, theCanon of the Mass, and the chapter of ‘defects.’”The latter document specified appears to be theRoman Papal bull De Defectibus, which itemizesdefects in the performance of the Roman Mass,along with their consequences and remedies, ifany.So, with reference to those Roman13Liber ABA.sources, and to Crowley’s various writings, weshould be able to get a fairly detailed idea ofthese three central prerequisites for Eucharisticmagick.The first condition is chastity. We areimmediately warned by a footnote in Magickthat, “The Word Chastity is used by initiates tosignify a certain state of soul and of minddeterminant of a certain habit of body which isnowise identical with what is commonlyunderstood. Chastity in the true magical sense ofthe word is inconceivable to those who are notwholly emancipated from the obsession of sex.”Since Crowley is emphasizing the special sense ofthe term in its use “by initiates,” we may safelydisregard the Roman Church resources on thisparticular count.In the chapter “On Chastity” in LiberAleph, Crowley advises that “Love is anExpression of the Will of the Body,” and thatchastity consists in maintaining the purity of thatexpression, through fervency, firmness, andstability. Further, in Little Essays Toward Truthhe writes that “Chastity may thus be defined asthe strict observance of the Magical Oath; that is,in the Light of the Law of Thelema, absolute andThe Journal of Thelemic Studies10The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"perfected devotion to the Holy Guardian Angel,and exclusive pursuit of the Way of True Will.”In our Gnostic and Catholic Church,clergy have taken magical oaths under the rubricof our holy orders, our ordination being aninitiatory passage into the chastity of theChurch’s Eucharistic mystery. But members ofthe laity, and even skilled magicians who are notformally affiliated with the Church, can cultivatethe required chastity in the context of the GnosticMass—by observing and applying their ownobligations and consciousness of the Great Workas communicants.Insofar as chastity “is connected only byobscure magical links with the sexual function,”14it depends on the free erotic vitality of theindividual. The libidinal condition of theEucharistic operator should not be weakened byeither denial or satiety. In this respect, it isimportant to consider the preeminentidiosyncrasy of sexual appetite. Only theoperator can judge what sexual situation bestfacilitates his or her own chastity. The idea ofsublimating the erotic force into the ceremonies,as implicitly advanced by those sacramentarybodies that require celibacy of their priests, isactually incorrect by an angle of 90°. Thestrength of the sexual charge induces aEucharistic current perpendicular to the libidinalcirculation.Taken as a whole, the magical concept ofchastity may be summarized by the opening ofPsalm CXIX: Beati quorum via integra est: quiambulant in lege domini. “Blessed are those whoare whole in the Way, who walk in the law of theLord.” The chaste magician has integrity, in theliteral sense of “wholeness.” The magician’sentire being is dedicated to the work, and thiscommitment is a dynamic walking of the Way,not a static position of timid “purity.” The Lord is14 Little Essays Toward Truth.the personal genius or Holy Guardian Angel ofthe magician, and his law is Do what thou wilt.On the topic of fasting, the RomanChurch has changed its rules and standards forthe Eucharistic fast over time, with sometraditions and customs particular to certaincountries or orders within the church. In DeDefectibus the stipulations for fasting are classedunder “Defects of the disposition of body”:“28. If a priest has not been fasting for atleast one hour before Communion, hemay not celebrate. The drinking of water,however, does not break the fast.29. The sick, even though they are notbed-ridden, may take non-alcoholicliquids as well as true and propermedicine, whether liquid or solid, beforethe celebration of Mass, without any timelimit.30. Priests who can do so are earnestlyinvited to observe the ancient andvenerable form of the Eucharistic fastbefore Mass.”The “ancient and venerable form” dictatesthat fasting would commence on the midnightbefore the celebration of Mass. During the lastcentury, the Roman Church has shown aninclination to lessen the severity of requirementsfor fasting, particularly with respect to eveningMasses. Pope Paul VI is said to have reduced thefasting requirement for priests to a mere fifteenminutes under some circumstances.In Magick, Crowley writes that the“Ancient Magicians” engaged in rigorous fasting“so that the body itself might destroy anythingextraneous to the bare necessity of its existence.”But he claims that modern sophistication permitsthe neglect of such an “external” regimen, infavor of the most scrupulous “internalpurification”: “We may eat meat, provided thatThe Journal of Thelemic Studies11The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"in doing so we affirm that we eat it in order tostrengthen us for the special purpose of ourproposed invocation.”15 In my own practice, I have found that anactual fast of about four waking hours is optimal.Such a rule should be adjusted for the health andmetabolism of the individual magician, throughtrial and experience. The fast should permit a fulldigestion of prior meals, so that the Eucharist isconsumed on an empty stomach. A slightconscious hunger can be an asset in theexecution of Eucharistic magick, but the fastshould not be taken to the point that weaknessensues, or that a deficiency of blood sugarcreates irritability or loss of concentration.For Christians the fast is colored by thenotion of a penitential observance, which doesnot apply to the Thelemic magician. Moralisticarguments regarding the subjugation ofconcupiscence are also quite irrelevant to ourEucharist. Instead, the essence of the fast isinformed by the idea presented in the creed ofLiber XV, which equates the Miracle of the Masswith the metabolic transformation of food anddrink into human activity and experience, i.e.“spiritual substance.” By observing a Eucharisticfast, the food and drink of the ceremony isdistinguished as its own meal, a sacred feast setapart and specifically devoted to consciousprosecution of the individual’s spiritual work.The fast promotes an awareness of both thesacramental substances and the magician’s ownbody as vehicles of the divine force.The condition of earnest and continualaspiration is in some measure addressed by thesection on “Defect of intention” in DeDefectibus:“23. The intention of consecrating isrequired. Therefore there is no15Liber ABA.consecration in the following cases: whena priest does not intend to consecrate butonly to make a pretense; when some hostsremain on the altar forgotten by the priest,or when some part of the wine or somehost is hidden, since the priest intends toconsecrate only what is on the corporal;when a priest has eleven hosts before himand intends to consecrate only ten,without determining which ten he meansto consecrate. On the other hand, if hethinks there are ten, but intends toconsecrate all that he has before him, thenall will be consecrated. For that reasonevery priest should always have such anintention, namely the intention ofconsecrating all the hosts that have beenplaced on the corporal before him forconsecration.”This passage is especially pertinent withrespect to the issue of “earnestness.” A merepretense of enacting the ritual, whether toimpress others, to provide for their instruction, oras a deliberate deception, will not suffice to effectconsecration. Note also that for clergy to reduceEucharistic ceremony to pretense is a violation ofsacerdotal chastity as defined above.Continuity of aspiration is closely relatedto its earnestness. Continuous aspiration must bean inherent development of the ongoing spiritualcondition of the magician. It cannot be aprovisional or experimental attitude. It cannot befeigned or temporarily posited. Many questionsin a Eucharistic ritual may be resolved on aprovisional basis, but not the central aspiration ofthe magician.The “Defect of intention” passage containsone additional point which merits discussion:“26. It may be that the intention is notactual at the time of the ConsecrationThe Journal of Thelemic Studies12The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"because the priest lets his mind wander,yet is still virtual, since he has come to thealtar intending to do what the Churchdoes. In this case the Sacrament is valid.A priest should be careful, however, tomake his intention actual also.”This loophole of “virtual intention” wouldcertainly not apply to a solo Eucharist like theMass of the Phoenix. Nor would it apply to thepriest’s own communion in the Gnostic Mass,since our magick does depend on thepractitioner’s puissance, rather than an allegedtransmission of god-given authority embodied in“what the Church does.” But this possibility of“virtual intention” suggests, and appropriately so,that the efficacy of the Eucharist for acongregation may be somewhat independent of afailed (and thus “virtual”) intention of the priest.A magician communicating as a member of thecongregation could receive a full Eucharisticbenefit as long as his or her own actual intentionwere fully formed and maintained. Thus, for theindividual communicant, the communicant’sintention can be taken to “override” that of theMass officers when considering the benefit to thatcommunicant. This consideration becomesespecially apt, when considering the need foraspiration appropriate to the individual’s state ofattainment.In his discussion of the Holy Oil inMagick, Crowley distinguishes betweenaspiration on the one hand, and mere spiritualambition on the other. Ambition may bedirected to further attainment by development ofthe magician’s knowledge and abilities, butaspiration requires an orientation to somethingwhich is other and beyond the aspirant. The firstaspiration of the true magician is to theKnowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel. The aspiration of the adept whohas attained to that Knowledge and Conversationwill then be to the interior church, theilluminated brotherhood which Thelemicscriptures figure under the image of the City ofthe Pyramids. Those who have taken their placesin the City of the Pyramids aspire to the magickprogress and transformation of humanity as awhole. These stages are the aspirational sequencedescribed in Crowley’s theories of magick,although precocious operators may aspirebeyond their grade, and other aspirations may bethe basis for the work of magicians laboringoutside of the categories defined by thosetheories.The fulfillment of the three foregoingconditions does not guarantee the efficacy ofEucharistic ceremony, but they provide themagician with an essential foundation for thatwork. They can be figured under the formula ofthe masculine trinity of Father, Son, and InteriorSpirit, where:•The Father is the Sun, the Egyptian Ra,the central aspiration of the magician, theradiant heart fueling the magick. •The Son is Mars, the Egyptian Hoor, thechastity of the magician, the vigilant andfervent limbs defending the magick. •The Spirit, Khuit in Egyptian, is theEucharistic fast, the balanced appetite ofthe magician, the warm and eager bloodcirculating the magick. .  May the observance of these conditionsinspire, fortify, and fructify our magicks, in thename of IAO.Love is the law, love under will.The Journal of Thelemic Studies13The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"On the Formula of the Gnostic Massby Soror Matheis & Frater JonesOriginally published in the Summer 2007 e.v. issue of the Coph Nia “Wand”.Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.“The Temple described in Liber XV follows the pattern of the Tree of Life.

The Altar of Incense is stationed at Tiphareth. The Font is stationed at Yesod, and theTomb is stationed at Malkuth.” – Soror Helena & Tau Apiryon, Mystery of Mysteryhe layout of the Gnostic Mass Temple,set forth in “Of the Furnishings of theTemple”16 clearly delineates the Tree ofLife as explicated by Golden Dawn and used byCrowley. And though this is supported by theplacement of the Solomonic pillars, traditionallyused in Hebrew Qabalah, to indicate Severityand Mercy, in this schema only the Sephiroth ofthe Middle Pillar are fully elaborated by physicalobjects within the Temple structure itself (cf. TheLayout of the Temple, below).TThe pillars or pylons that stand aside themain altar represent Binah and Chokmah ofcourse but this symbolic relationship does notitself extend below the abyss.This would seem to leaveChesed, Geburah, Netzach andHod unaccounted for, at leastso far as their stations areconcerned. Where then are theremaining Sephiroth of thesepillars? How are they and theirfunctions represented in theMass? Did Crowley just leave16Liber XV, section I.them out? We propose that the answers to thesequestions lie in the offices of the Children17 andthat a close reading of the rubric of the GnosticMass will clear up all of these ambiguities.Let us first examine these seeminglymissing Sephiroth in light of their traditionalGolden Dawn attributions as expressed inLiber 777. The Tree of Life itself is composedof vertical and horizontal components, andeach Sephira is connected to others by paths.The lowest tier of the horizontal components isone that is seemingly not expressed in thephysical layout of the Gnostic Mass temple, thatof Hod and Netzach. But if we examine theelemental attributions of these Sephiroth wecan see that their function is clearly expressedin the mechanics of the Gnostic Mass by thechildren. Hod is given the elemental attributionof water and Netzach that of fire. This oftenseems strange considering the symbolism ofthese spheres and their planetary correlations,but it is based on the typically ordinalvaluation18 that permeates the Golden Dawn17Liber XV, section II.18See Crowley’s notes to Column XI in 777.The Journal of Thelemic Studies14The Mysteries of the Gnostic MassThe Layout of the Temple"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"system and, as Liber 777 indicates, it wasclearly in Crowley’s mind and thus we cansafely assume that any attribution of thesepositions would reflect that attribution.When the Priest is purified andconsecrated by the Priestess, the Negative Childbrings the water from the position of Hod(ruled by water19) and the Positive Child bringsthe fire, from the position of Netzach (ruled byfire20). Again when the Priest in turn purifiesand consecrates the Priestess, the Children haveassumed their respective positions at Geburahand Chesed. The Negative child provides thewater for purification from Chesed (ruled bywater21) and the positive child provides theburning incense from the position from theposition of Geburah (ruled by fire22). Until theconclusion of the Mass the Children standrepresenting their respective Pillars (save whenthey accompany the Priest ).At the Consummation of the Elements23the Children serve to carry the consecratedelements across the abyss, the Negative Childin Chesed serving as the cup bearer and thePositive Child in Geburah bearing the Paten.Chesed, as we have seen before, is ruled bywater and so the office of the Negative Child,as cup-bearer, is completely natural andappropriate. The Positive Child’s office inoffering the Cake of Light is somewhat morecomplex. It must be remembered that while thenature of the host is passive and earthy, itcontains the fiery oil of Abramelin andsymbolically represents the seed of the Priest(the י or fiery aspect of יהוה) with which heinseminates the Cup via the Lance or Spear.2419777, col.XI, line 8.20777, col.XI, line 7.21777, col.XI, line 4.22777, col.XI, line 5.23Liber XV, section VIII.24777, col.XLI, line 5.Much debate surrounds the importanceof the use of the offices of the Children in theGnostic Mass, but it should now be clearlyunderstood that without the function of theirparticular offices; the entire symbolism of theTree of Life, so central to the mystery of theMass, is in many ways nullified and leftincomplete. Likewise if the Priestess andDeacon assume these offices, several symbolicand magical problems arise. First eachcongregant is thrust across the abyss during theact of taking communion. This may besomewhat nullified in the case of the clergy,who are used to symbolically taking this actionin the course of their normal liturgical practice,but it subjects regular congregants to magicalforces for which they may not be prepared ortrained, and it denies them the advantage of theecclesiastical function, whose purpose is tobring this blessing from above for their benefit.It also denies the Deacon his proper function,at Tiphareth, in marshaling the congregation,symbolically revolving about the Sun, which hethereat represents, and symbolically forcing thecongregants to wander in darkness toward thealtar. Hopefully these arguments make clear theduties, responsibilities and importance of theoffice of Children in the Gnostic Mass. In all itwould seem proper and beneficial for both theliturgical and magical purposes of the ritual touse Children in their proper offices as set forthby Aleister Crowley in his foundational text forthe performance of this ritual, central to boththe Ordo Templi Orientis and the EcclesiaGnostica Catholica.Love is the law, love under will.The Journal of Thelemic Studies15The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"A Structural Model of the Collectsby Craig BerryNote: First published in Agapé, Vol 14 Numbers 1 & 2, Spring/Summer 2013 EVDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.he seventh Collect of the Gnostic Massinvites us to subdivide the universe into“Mysterious energy, triform” and“mysterious matter in fourfold and sevenfolddivision.” The subdivisions of matter total toeleven, which is of course the number of theCollects themselves. This inspired me toinvestigate whether the Collects could usefully bemapped onto the divisions of energy and matterdescribed by the seventh Collect. TObviously, significant sets of three, four,and seven entities are extraordinarily common inthe western esoteric tradition, and in the broadermythology from which it draws. However, forour purposes here, it is most productive toascribe them as follows:•The three alchemical principles: Salt,Sulphur, and Mercury.•The four elements: Fire, Water, Air, andEarth.•The seven traditional planets: Sol, Luna,Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, andSaturn. Mappings onto any other attributions ofthe same numbers is generally straightforward. The last four Collects form an obviouscoherent subset, devoted to the cycle of humanlife, so it seems reasonable at the outset to assignthem to the elements. There are a number ofways this could be done which would besymbolically satisfying, but my own preference is•8th Collect — Birth =Air•9th Collect — Marriage = Fire •10th Collect — Death = Water•11th Collect — The End = Earth Among other things, this creates adirectional cycle clockwise from the East whenusing Golden Dawn directional attributions forthe elements. We must then decide how to assign theseven planets to the remaining seven Collects.Two of our choices are trivial - “The Sun” and“The Moon”. Given the close magicalconnection between planetary Saturn and all theforms of Earth (see e.g. the dual attributions ofthe 32nd path in Qabalah), assigning Saturn to“The Earth” seems warranted as well. “The Saints”, with its stress on “the mightof man” and exclusively male list of Saints, seemsa clear choice for Mars. Similarly, “ThePrinciples” is extremely Mercurial in its delight inanalysis and movement. This leaves us withJupiter and Venus, which align naturally with“The Lord” and “The Lady”. What, then, of the alchemical principles?There are no leftover Collects for them, so wewill have to overlay them onto three Collectswhich already have planetary assignments. Asymmetrical arrangement seems most probable,meaning that one of them will land on the sixthCollect, “The Earth”— and Salt is the clear choicefor that correspondence. Similarly, we alreadyThe Journal of Thelemic Studies16The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"have planetary Mercury assigned to the adjoiningseventh Collect, so it would seem simplest toplace alchemical Mercury there as well. And inthe symmetrically corresponding position on theother side of “The Earth” lies the fifth Collect,“The Saints”, which is as good a fit for Sulphuras it is for Mars. Our table of correspondencesnow looks like this: CollectPlanetPrincipleElementThe SunSolThe LordJupiterThe MoonLunaThe LadyVenusThe SaintsMarsSulphurThe EarthSaturnSaltThe PrinciplesMercuryMercuryBirthAirLifeFireDeathWaterThe EndEarthThis is a satisfying arrangement, andcertainly seems to fulfill the terms laid out in theseventh Collect. But the order of the planets ispuzzling. One would hope that there would besome rhyme or reason to their sequence. When dealing with arrangements of theplanets, it is often useful to consider thetraditional sequence of planetary hours: Saturn,Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, Luna. If onearranges these in a circle and links the planetscorresponding to the successive days of the week,this heptagram emerges.For example, starting at Sol (Sunday) andmoving three positions clockwise leads to Luna(Monday), from there, moving three morepositions clockwise arrives at Mars (Tuesday),and so on through the week. This arises as anatural consequence of there being three fullcycles of the seven planetary hours in each day,with three hours left over (3 x 7 + 3 = 24); thuseach new day starts with a planetary hour threepositions clockwise around the circle from theprevious one. Obviously, that heptagram (and the“move three positions clockwise” rule underlyingit) does not resemble the sequence we haveascribed to the first seven Collects—but it turnsout that another one works perfectly. If we usethe rule “move two positions counterclockwise”(or equivalently, “move five positionsclockwise”), a new heptagram emerges.The Journal of Thelemic Studies17The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Starting at Sol (“The Sun”), we gocounterclockwise two positions to Jupiter (“TheLord”), then two more to Luna (“The Moon”),and so on through the first seven Collects. There is an implicit cycle here; once wearrive at Mercury (“The Principles”), another twopositions counterclockwise brings us back to Sol,and the whole sequence begins again. Given thatwe already identified a directional wheel with theelements, and that the three alchemical principlesare very commonly depicted as occupying therim of a turning wheel, it is satisfying andconsistent to discover that the planets are joiningin the circular dance as well. Finally, the particular heptagramdescribed by the sequence of the first sevenCollects is the Star of BABALON, the feminineforce identified in the Creed as being cognatewith the Earth, birth, and death -- and hencemanifestation. How appropriate to find theimprint of the Mother, Latin Mater, root of theword “matter”, on the sevenfold division ofmatter!It is impossible to know whether Crowleyintentionally included any of this symbolism inthe Mass.

Thereis always a specific reason for the numberassociated with each text, and if you look just alittle bit, a lot can be found. If we look atCrowley's essay “Gematria”25 we find, “15. IH,Jah, one of the ineffable names; the Father andMother united.” The first two meanings are (A) aname of God and (B) Father and Mother united. A) IH, or “Jah,” is one of the “ineffablenames” of God. This is the “one secret andineffable LORD” from the Creed, “our Lord inourselves whose name is Mystery of Mystery”from the Priest's speech on his third step beforeopening the veil, and the “Lord secret and mostholy, source of light, source of life, source oflove, source of liberty” from the Collects. It is aname of the Highest God who is also our InmostSelf. This LORD is invoked explicitly andconstantly throughout the entire Gnostic Mass.B) Father and Mother united refers to theformula of the Tetragrammaton, the four-letteredname of God transliterated as IHVH or YHVH(Yod, Heh, Vav, Heh). In this formula, Y is theFather/Chokmah, M is the Mother/Binah, V isthe Son/Tiphareth, and Final H is theDaughter/Malkuth. In terms of magical weapons,Y and H are the Lance and Cup, which are alsothe “weapons” of the Priest (Y or I, the Father)and Priestess (H, the Mother), respectively.Y/Father and H/Mother become “united” andproduce a Child, V/Son, the Sun.26 Y/Father andH/Mother (15) come together (1+5) to make the25Can be found in 777 and Other Qabalistic Writings.26Y = 10, H =5, and together they are 15. Son/V (6). This is seen in ceremonial-dramaticform in the Mass, most explicitly when the Lanceenters the Cup to give her the “particle” inorgasm (“HRILIU”). The Lion and Serpent “thatdestroy the destroyer”27 is then invoked. Eachcommunicant, partaking of the two-fold Eucharistand declaring “There is no part of me that is notof the Gods” is that Son, a God, the Lion and theSerpent, the Child Horus of Babalon/Nuit(Priestess) and Beast/Hadit (Priest). Father andMother united shows us that this God is neithermasculine nor feminine but Two-in-One,transcending opposites and all dualities. Themost recognizable example of this is Levi'sdrawing of Baphomet who combines masculineand feminine elements in one Being. This name of God, IH or Jah, ismentioned in both “Sepher Sephiroth” andMagick in Theory & Practice as “the Monogramof the Eternal,” which leads into the next majoraspect of the number 15. 15 relates to Atu XV:The Devil in the Tarot and is explicitlyassociated with “the Monogram of the Eternal,”Jah, when Crowley writes of this Devil in Magickin Theory & Practice:“'The Devil' is, historically, the God ofany people that one personally dislikes.This has led to so much confusion ofthought that THE BEAST 666 haspreferred to let names stand as they are,and to proclaim simply that AIWAZ —the solar-phallic-hermetic 'Lucifer' is Hisown Holy Guardian Angel, and 'The27From the Mystic Marriage and Consummation of theElements near the end of the Gnostic Mass.The Journal of Thelemic Studies19The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Devil' SATAN or HADIT of ourparticular unit of the Starry Universe.

They are “Yod He, theMonogram of the Eternal, the Father one withthe Mother, the Virgin Seed one with all-containing Space.” This is “the Serpent and theLion, Mystery of Mystery, in His nameBAPHOMET,”28 the child that is created byFather and Mother, the Eucharist that isconsumed by the communicants, and thereforethe communicants themselves. Consider how theLion-Serpent in the image is balanced by the Sunand Moon, i.e. it arises with the conjunction ofthe Mother and Father principles. Just as Haditproclaims, “I am alone: there is no God where Iam,”29 each Communicant proclaims their ownGodhead after consuming the Eucharist andsaying, “There is no part of me that is not of thegods.” Atu XV: The Devil depicts (in thebackground) the union of the Pillar/Phallus andthe Ring of Nuit/Yoni, the conjunction of whom28From the 3rd line of the Creed of the Gnostic Mass.29Liber AL vel Legis II:23.creates the Goat/Baphomet as the Two-in-OneGod of Generative power; he is “Horus come tofull growth.”30Yod and Heh also represent the union ofthe soul and God (as it is said), the “Virgin Seedone with all-containing Space,” and thereforerepresents the union of opposites in general. Thissymbolically refers to the union of ego and non-ego, subject and object, in samadhi. Crowleywrites, “The Yod and the He combine, theFather and Mother unite, to produce a son, Vau.This son is the exalted state of mind producedby the union of the subject and the object. Thisstate of mind is called Samadhi in the Hinduterminology.”31 The Gnostic Mass is thereforealso a symbolic representation of the union ofHadit (Priest) and Nuit (Priestess) to produce Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the Sun, the state of samadhi orunion with God or non-duality (or plenty of othernames). The union of the Lance and the Cup asthe Father and Mother united (the Father “dying”in orgasm in the Mother; the ego is dissolved inthe Absolute in Crossing the Abyss; “'Jesus,' slainwith the Lance, whose blood is collected in aCup”32) are the Greater Mysteries. The LesserMysteries are those of the Sword and Disk. TheSword and the Disk are the Mind and Body andrefer to the Miracle of Incarnation, the cycle ofBirth-Life-Death that is celebrated in O.T.O.'sMan of Earth degrees, which Crowley connectswith “On, Oannes, Noah, and the like.”33 Onecould oversimplify and say the Lesser Mysteriesare how a God becomes Man through30Magick in Theory and Practice, chapter 5 “The Formula ofI.A.O.”31Eight Lectures on Yoga, “Yoga for Yellowbellies,” “First Lecture,” paragraph 3.32New Comment to Liber AL, I:7.33New Comment to Liber AL, I:7.

The Mass has many dimensions,and the more of these perspectives that one sees,the more one can have a deeper appreciation ofthe ritual. Sometimes individuals seem to getstuck in a single dimension and see, for example,only the dimension that the Mass is a ritualenactment of sex magick and a veiled form ofthe IX° O.T.O. supreme secret. This is certainlyone dimension, but to only see one dimensionforecloses on the possibility of seeing the manyperspectives that will enrich one’s knowledge,experience, and appreciation of the Mass.Therefore, the purpose of this essay is to discusscertain important dimensions of the GnosticMass, although it will not (nor can it be) acompletely exhaustive list.LFor example: From the dimension of theHermetic Qabalah, the Priest is in Tiphareth, theRuach or conscious self, with the surroundingfaculties (Chesed/memory, Geburah/volition,Netzach/desire, Hod/reason) being representedby the Deacon. The Priestess is both theNephesh, the animal soul, as well as theNeschamah, aspiration toward the divine and theinflux of divine intelligence/intuition.Qabalistically, the Mass shows the Nephesh(Malkuth; the Virgin Priestess as Earthly) beingelevated to the Neschamah (Binah; the HighPriestess enthroned as an embodied form ofNuit), and the Ruach (Tiphareth; the Priest as aman among men) being elevated to Chiah(Chokmah; the Priest whose Rod is that whichwas, and is, and is to come). Their final unionreleases Yechidah, the supreme individuality ofKether, which communes with the entire Treedown to Malkuth (the Congregants).This is just one dimension of the GnosticMass given as an example. I will now go throughseveral important dimensions of the Mass in a bitmore detail to show there are many differentperspectives from which to view this ritual.Celebration of the forces of NatureIf one reads the Mass fairly literally, onesees that it is a celebration of the forces ofNature. Crowley was a proponent of scientificreligion that did not flaunt our currentknowledge of the world. On this he wrote:“Human nature demands (in the case ofmost people) the satisfaction of thereligious instinct, and, to very many, thismay best be done by ceremonial means. Iwished therefore to construct a ritualthrough which people might enter intoecstasy as they have always done underthe influence of appropriate ritual. Inrecent years, there has been an increasingfailure to attain this object, because theestablished cults shock their intellectualconvictions and outrage their commonsense. Thus their minds criticize theirenthusiasm; they are unable toconsummate the union of their individualThe Journal of Thelemic Studies22The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"souls with the universal soul as abridegroom would be to consummate hismarriage if his love were constantlyreminded that its assumptions wereintellectually absurd.I resolved that my ritual [the GnosticMass] should celebrate the sublimity ofthe operation of universal forces withoutintroducing disputable metaphysicaltheories. I would neither make nor implyany statement about nature which wouldnot be endorsed by the most materialisticman of science. On the surface this maysound difficult; but in practice I found itperfectly simple to combine the mostrigidly rational conceptions of phenomenawith the most exalted and enthusiasticcelebration of their sublimity.” 34 There is a consistent Thelemic cosmologyespoused in the Gnostic Mass that is fairlynaturalistic. The cosmology is also reflected inmany parts of The Book of Lies as they werewritten in the same year and show very similarviews. The universe espoused in the GnosticMass is a series of dyads: one might call them“pairs of opposites” but they are not absolutelyopposite in many ways, and their function ismore to complement and work with one another.Crowley says “the universe [is] enclosed in thelaw of Lingam-Yoni,” which is another way to say“the law of yin-yang” or simply complementarydyads.There is an ineffable Lord, Hadit, and anineffable Lady, Nuit, who are consorts. This ismentioned in the Creed (“one secret andineffable lord), the Collects (“The Lord” Collectand “The Lady” Collect), and elsewhere. Nuit isSpace and Hadit is Motion. Another way to say“motion” is Time, as motion only takes placethrough the unfolding of time. Therefore, Nuit34Confessions, chapter 73.and Hadit are Space and Time, or simply Space-Time since it is an interwoven continuum. Nuitand Hadit are the foundations that give rise tothe potential of a universe.When manifested in the world, Haditbecomes “Chaos,” the “father of life.” Chaos isthe masculine principle in all things, which onthe grandest scale is Energy itself, the forceswhich constitute the universe. When manifestedin the world, Nuit becomes “Babalon, “themother of us all.” Babalon is the feminineprinciple in all things, which on the grandestscale is Matter itself. Therefore, Chaos andBabalon are the Energy and Matter whichconstitute the universe. “GOD is concealed in thewhirling energy of Nature.”35 We also know thatenergy and matter are essentially the same thing,so Chaos and Babalon are consorts representingMatter-Energy. “[There is] a seeming duality ofChaos and Babalon; these are called Father andMother, but it is not so. They are called Brotherand Sister, but it is not so. They are calledHusband and Wife, but it is not so.”36 AsCrowley comments, “Chaos and Babalon... arereally one.”37Chaos and Babalon are both reflected inthe Macrocosm and the Microcosm. In theMacrocosm, the Lord is the Sun and the Lady isthe Earth. The Sun is “masculine” insofar as itgives life and light, and the Earth is “feminine”insofar as it conceives and nourishes life. Theunion of the life- and light-giving powers of theSun with the conceptive powers of the Earthgives rise to all life.Chaos and Babalon reflected into theMicrocosm are the Generative Powers in menand women. Hadit says of himself in The Bookof the Law, “I am the flame that burns in every35The Book of Lies.36The Book of Lies.37The Book of Lies.The Journal of Thelemic Studies23The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"heart of man, and in the core of every star. I amLife, and the giver of Life, yet therefore is theknowledge of me the knowledge of death.”38“Generative Powers” refers to our life-energy andcreative power in general, but especially thepower to sexually reproduce. “GOD the Fatherand Mother is concealed in Generation.”39 The union of Man and Woman give riseto the perpetuation of new life. This is known asthe “Phallus,” which is the creative-generativepower within each individual regardless of sex.The name goes unspoken or is called Mystery ofMystery in the Gnostic Mass, although the Priestdoes say “Phalle” in the rending of the Veil. It iscalled “the essence of every true god that is uponthe surface of the Earth” in the Collects.The Generative Power of Man is reflectedin the Sacred Lance and that of Woman in theHoly Graal or Chalice. These are thereproductive organs (and their powers) of themale and female, specifically the penis and thewomb. The particle represents the Semen orSeed of the Man, and the wine represents themenstruum of the Woman. Therefore, oneimportant dimension of the Gnostic Mass is the38Liber AL, II:6.39The Book of Lies.celebration of the the process of Generation, theunion of complementary powers to perpetuateLife. The Lance and Chalice are used to createthe Eucharist, the masculine reflected in theCake of Light and the feminine reflected in theWine. The Cake of Light is that which fortifiesour bodies (“life”; “sustenance of endeavour”)and the Wine is that which vitalizes our minds(“joy”; “inspiration of endeavour”).The Path of InitiationAnother dimension of the Gnostic Mass isthat it is an enactment of the Path of Initiation.Initiation is the process of “spiritualadvancement”; it is called “the process by whicha man comes to learn that unknown Crown”40 aswell as the path of enlightenment, the path ofattainment, and many other names. In otherwords, the Mass depicts the unfolding of innertransformation.The Priest represents every individual, theconscious self: he is the one who undergoes the“hero’s journey” in the narrative of the Mass.The other Officers (Priestess, Deacon, andChildren) are “part of the PRIEST himself.” Thisshows that the interaction between the Officersshows an interaction within every individual,reinforcing that the Mass depicts an innertransformation.The Priest begins asleep in the darkness ofignorance. The rest of the Mass involves hisawakening to the Light of Truth. The Priestessrepresents both the spiritual forces of awakeningas well as the object of attainment itself. She canbe seen as the Holy Guardian Angel of thePriest. He is “directly inspired from Kether, theultimate Self, through the Path of the HighPriestess, or initiated intuition.”41The Priestess descends to the Tomb and40Liber LXI vel Causae.41Liber Samekh.The Journal of Thelemic Studies24The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"rends the veil of darkness “by the power of Iron.”Iron represents Mars or destructive energy, andindividuals are often called to the path inresponse to tragedy, crisis, or suffering in general.“The Aspiration to become a Master is rooted inthe Trance of Sorrow.”42 The Priestess raises thePriest in order to “administer the virtues to theBrethren.” This shows the ultimate goal is tovitalize others, “the Way of Service,”43 essentiallyidentical with the Bodhisattva vow to attain forthe sake of all beings.The Priest is purified and consecrated inbody and soul, and he obtains the Lance, asymbol of spiritual maturity. Crowley wrote,“What then is the formula of the initiation ofHorus? It will no longer be that of the Man,through Death. It will be the natural growth ofthe Child. His experiences will no more beregarded as catastrophic. Their hieroglyph is theFool: the innocent and impotent HarpocratesBabe becomes the Horus Adult by obtaining theWand. ‘Der reine Thor’ [the pure fool seizes theSacred Lance.”44The Priest’s spiritual fire is kindled by hisaspiration toward Godhead. Through this, he hasthe Power to raise the Priestess to the High Altarin the East, which can be seen as the sacralizationor spiritualization of the “lower self,” thetransformation of the materialization of energyinto its more subtle form of Spirit. After purifyingand consecrating the now enthroned Priestess,the Priest is cast out into darkness in the darknight of the soul; having set upon the Path, heencounters trials and troubles. Through hisaspiration, the Priest invokes Nuit in the Priestess,the ultimate object of desire and union. ThePriest invokes Hadit in himself, identifying withthe ultimate subject, Life and Motion itself.42Little Essays Towards Truth.43Liber LXI vel Causae.44Liber Samekh.Finally he invokes Nuit and Hadit’s union, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the God within who transcendsspace, time, and causality, who transcends all thegods and even death itself. The completeidentification with Him essentially constitutesAttainment.The veil of darkness is then thrown open,casting light from the High Altar upon the Priestand filling the whole Temple with brilliance. ThePriestess is transformed and is now naked,holding the Chalice and Paten, the Godhead thatis beyond particular forms with which wecommune in Knowledge and Conversation of theHoly Guardian Angel. The Collects are thenread, each element of the world being invoked, aperfect, complete, and balanced Microcosm ofthe Universe. The Priest then consecrates theCake of Light and the wine with the power of theLance, turning them into their Divine form, thebody and blood of God. These are the elementsof the Priest with which he will interact with theworld: his body and his spirit. They are preparedas such through the “spiritual power” obtainedthrough the Knowledge and Conversation of hisHoly Guardian Angel.The Priest then invokes the highest,ineffable Godhead through the Anthem, Thatwhich is “I beyond all I am who hast no natureand no name,” “male-female, quintessential,one.” This is the steady aspiration and devotionthat propels the Priest to confront the Abyss, thedissolution of self whereby the True Self, thatwhich is one with Godhead, arises. The Priestbreaks off a particle, which represents “his Soul,a virgin offering to his Angel, pressed forth fromhis being by the intensity of this Aspiration.”45 Itis the final offering of the self, the draining ofone’s blood into the Cup of Babalon, wherebyone becomes annihilated and crosses the Abyss.This occurs in the simultaneous “HRILIU,” the45Liber Samekh.The Journal of Thelemic Studies25The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"orgasm of the spirit wherein Two become One,the dissolution of All into None, and the Priesthas thereby become a Master of the Temple.Then, Baphomet is invoked, the Two-in-One God who is “male-female, quintessential,one,” representing a state of consciousness whereopposites are fused into a unity. The Priest turnsaround to utter his Word. He lowers the Lance,announcing the Law, and the Congregantsrespond in kind, signifying the descent of thisTwo-in-One into all parts of the self, the entireTree of Life from Supernals to Malkuth. Thisincludes the Brethren for whom the Priest hasattained in order that he may administer theVirtues to them. The Brethren take part in hisWisdom and Understanding through theEucharist, and through this they come torecognize the Godhead with themselves. “Godmanifest in flesh” is their name. After a finalblessing, the Priest exhausts his purpose and dies,descending into the darkness of the Tomb thatanother Priest may arise and the cycle perpetuatethrough the generations.Psychological TransformationAnother dimension of the Gnostic Mass isthat it represents psychological transformation.The Jungian model of the psyche is especiallyconducive to being seen reflected in the Mass.The Priest represents the conscious self,the sense of subjectivity. This is not confinedmerely to the ego, the sense of personal identity,but the conscious awareness itself (within whichis the ego). The Deacon represents the facultiesof the conscious self. The Priestess represents theUnconscious: she is both the earthly, animal,instinctual side as well as the heavenly, divineside. In particular, she seems to be identified atparts with the “anima,” an anthropomorphizationof the unconscious mind, and an intermediarybetween the conscious self and the archetypalSelf, the true center of one’s being.The entire Gnostic Mass shows thepsychological transformation of the Priest goingfrom an identification with the persona to anidentification with the archetypal Self, whichencompasses the totality of the psyche, bothconscious and unconscious. The entire processmay be summarized as: the Priest identifyingwith Persona Priest identifying with Ego →→encounter with the Shadow encounter with the→Anima union with the Anima to “release” or→access the Self with which the Priest finallyidentifies.At the beginning of the Mass, the Priest isin the Tomb representing the darkness andconfinement of being identified with the persona,one’s outer personality. The Priestess descends asan unconscious impulse, experienced by thePriest as an appearance or a welling-up ofunconscious forces. The Priest is awakened to aThe Journal of Thelemic Studies26The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"self not confined merely to persona, and hebecomes identified with the ego.As the ego, he then exerts his power overhis unconscious and habitual instincts,represented as the Priestess kneeling beforebeing upraised. Then, the Priest and the Templeare plunged into darkness as he confronts his“shadow”, those aspects of the self that aredenied, repressed, and feared. His aspirationcarries him through the darkness, and eventuallyhe rends the veil to be met with an image of his“anima,” the naked Priestess enthroned. Theanima is the almost like a reflection in theunconscious of the conscious self, it is the“hidden opposite gender in each individual,”representing a layer of the psyche deeper thanthe shadow. As Jung wrote, “Every man carrieswithin him the eternal image of woman, not theimage of this or that particular woman, but adefinite feminine image. This image isfundamentally unconscious, an hereditary factorof primordial origin engraved in the livingorganic system of the man.”46 The “anima” orPriestess acts as mediator between theunconscious (the High Altar and all within theVeil of the Supernals) and the conscious (the46Jung, Carl. The Collected Works, Volume 17.Priest).The Priest and Priestess unite,representing the acceptance and integration ofthe contrasexual archetype into oneself, i.e.becoming Two-in-One, represented in imagerysuch as the Alchemical Androgyne or, moreaptly, Baphomet. The final proclamation of“There is no part of me that is not of the gods”signifies the emergence of the archetype of theSelf, that which contains all elements of thepsyche in a unified totality. This is not the sameas “mystical union” or samadhi, but a sense ofcomplete unity within one’s own being, theintegration of all the parts of oneself into a singlewhole. Jung defined individuation as:“becoming an ‘in-dividual,’ and in so faras ‘individuality’ embraces our innermost,last, and incomparable uniqueness, it alsoimplies becoming one’s own self. Wecould therefore translate individuation as‘coming to selfhood’ or ‘self-realization...’Egotists are called ‘selfish,’ but this,naturally, has nothing to do with theconcept of ‘Self’ as I am using it here...Individuation, therefore, can only mean aprocess of psychological development thatfulfills the individual qualities given; inother words, it is a process by which aman becomes the definite, unique beinghe in fact is. In so doing he does notbecome ‘selfish’ in the ordinary sense ofthe word, but is merely fulfilling thepeculiarity of his nature, and this... isvastly different from egotism orindividualism.” 47In other words, the Priest has immersedhimself in the unconscious self stage by stage. Hehas united by “love under will,” i.e. revealed,accepted, and integrated the various archetypalforces that emerge, and he has become wholly47Jung, Carl.

The Priest represents thesubject of awareness, the sense of “I” or self. ThePriestess represents the object of concentration ordevotion. The Lance of the Priest represents thepower of concentration itself.Traditionally, the process of concentrationculminating in samadhi is called, as a whole,samyama. Samyama has three stages: dharana,dhyana, and samadhi. To oversimplify, dharanais when the subject begins to concentrate on thechosen object: the focus has been narroweddown to that particular object of concentration sothat no other object takes the subject’s focusaway. Crowley writes, “In the course of ourconcentration we noticed that the contents of themind at any moment consisted of two things, andno more: the Object, variable, and the Subject,invariable, or apparently so. By success inDharana the object has been made as invariableas the subject.”48 Dhyana is when dharana has beenintensified to the point where there is only anawareness of the object, even the awareness ofoneself as a subject has faded away. Samadhi isthe culmination of dhyana whereby both subjectand object “merge” or disappear into a non-dualunity.In the Gnostic Mass, the Priest’s Lance isstroked eleven times by the Priestess; this showsthe awakening to dharana, the first stage ofsamyama. This dharana culminates in the Priest48Liber ABA, Part I: Mysticism.kissing the Book on the Priestess’ chest threetimes and kneeling in adoration. The Priest isthen in darkness for three circumambulations ofthe Temple. This may represent the “darkness”or struggle that often comes when beginning inthe practice of samyama. Crowley likens thisaspect of the work of samyama (or simply“Yoga”) to the formula of IAO:“In beginning a meditation practice, thereis always a quiet pleasure, a gentle naturalgrowth [dharana and the raising up to theHigh Altar]; one takes a lively interest inthe work; it seems easy; one is quitepleased to have started. This stagerepresents Isis. Sooner or later it issucceeded by depression—the Dark Nightof the Soul, an infinite weariness anddetestation of the work [the threecircumambulations of the darkenedTemple]. The simplest and easiest actsbecome almost impossible to perform.Such impotence fills the mind withapprehension and despair. The intensityof this loathing can hardly be understoodby any person who has not experiencedit. This is the period of Apophis.” 49 By continued con-centration, the dharanabreaks into dhyana in thepiercing of the Veil and theinflux of Light from theHigh Altar.

At this moment, both Priest andPriestess hold both Lance and Cup and depressthe “particle,” the last bit of separateness, into theWine so that the two become One in samadhi.This “Eucharist” of samadhi may beunderstood as a subtler level of meaning to whatCrowley says when he writes, “The highest formof the Eucharist is that in which the Elementconsecrated is One. It is one substance and nottwo, not living and not dead, neither liquid norsolid, neither hot nor cold, neither male norfemale. This sacrament is secret in everyrespect.”50 It is “neither this nor that” because thesamadhi is transcendent of dualities – it is non-dual – and it is “secret in every respect” becauseit is beyond the possibility of communication asall language is inherently dualistic.Tantric RiteThe Gnostic Mass also contains thedimension of being an enactment of a Tantricrite. There are an immense amount of similaritiesbetween Tantra and Thelema, including but notlimited to: seeing the body as “good” and usefulfor attainment, seeing the body as a microcosmof the Universe, seeing the world not as maya orillusion but as the play of the power of Godhead,the visualization of self as Deity, thetranscendence of common morality and ethics, etcetera.In Tantra, there is something called the“Great Ritual” or the “Secret Ritual,” whichinvolves the use of wine (madya) and sexualunion (maithuna). Sound familiar? There are“left-hand” Tantrics who actually engage insexual intercourse and “right-hand” Tantrics whoonly engage in sexual intercourse symbolically(with sexual union itself being symbolic as well asthe visualization of sexual union).50Magick in Theory & Practice.Shiva is the formless, motionless Godheadthat is beyond all forms and expression, andShakti is the Power of that Godhead whenexpressed in form and motion; it is very similarto the concepts of Tao (Shiva) and of Teh(Shakti). Shakti is often identified with Kundalini,reinforced in the Mass by the Priestess’ 3 and ahalf circles around the Temple reflecting theKundalini serpent coiled 3 and a half timesaround the base of each individual’s spine.Interestingly, Shakti’s symbol is that of a trianglewith the apex downward, which is the symbol ofRa-Hoor-Khuit and the sign given by thePriestess when she is first raised to the HighAltar. The Priestess becomes not merely awoman but the Absolute Woman when raised tothe High Altar, and she becomes Shakti devoidof all particular forms in the stripping away allclothing.Basically, the yogi identifies with Shivaand all his corresponding properties; the femaleidentifies with Shakti, the primordial Powerinherent in all motion. This is similar to the ideaof the Scarlet Woman as an earthly avatar ofBabalon. Their union is a hieros gamos or “holymarriage”: the union of male and female is seenas the union of Shiva and Shakti, which may beoversimplified as the ultimate Subject and theultimate Object. This union creates the“androgynous Shiva,” known asArdhanarishvara, which literally means “the Lordwho is half woman.” Ardhanarishvara isessentially a Two-in-One form representing bothelements fused into One: nearly identical imagesare found in that of Baphomet and of theAlchemical Hermaphrodite or “Rebis.”This suspension of duality occurs duringthe erotic rapture of union, liberating this “Force”of Ardhanarishvara or Baphomet. This Two-in-One figure transcends all, including space andtime: it therefore is That which is the “breath thatThe Journal of Thelemic Studies29The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"makest every God even and Death to tremblebefore Thee.” It is the Lion and Serpent that“destroys the destroyer” of Death, being Thatwhich transcends all manifestation, all motion,and all duality. This is the amrita or ambrosia,both words meaning “not mortal” or “beyonddeath”; this is the true Elixir of Immortality, thesacrament of which one may partake and trulyproclaim “There is no part of me that is not ofthe gods.”Concluding RemarksIt should be emphasized once more thatthis list is not exhaustive: there are potentiallyinfinite other dimensions at work in the GnosticMass. Also, none of these dimensions that arementioned are fully fleshed out: one could easilywrite a whole book on the Gnostic Mass as aTantric rite, for example. The real point is toemphasize that there are, in fact, manydimensions to the Gnostic Mass. I believe thatthe more dimensions one can appreciate, thedeeper one’s experience and appreciation of theMass can be. Therefore, I hope that this essaywill spark in the reader a desire to see theGnostic Mass as something beyond merely aQabalistic drama or a veiled sexual magickritual. There is a vast reservoir of potentialhidden within the central rite of O.T.O., merelywaiting for the ingenium and courage of anearnest seeker to tap into it.Love is the law, love under will.The Journal of Thelemic Studies30The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Blood of the Sangraalby Gregory PetersNote: First published in Agapé, Volume 8, Number 4, February 2007 EVFor I am the first and the last.I am the honored one and the scorned one.I am the whore and the holy one.I am the wife and the virgin.I am the mother and the daughter.. . .For I am knowledge and ignorance.

WThus was the Great Work laid out. TheHoly Guardian Angel was (and is) the soleobjective of the Outer College.

This unachieved, man is no morethan the unhappiest and blindest of animals. Heis conscious of his own incomprehensiblecalamity, and clumsily incapable of repairing it.Achieved, he is no less than the co-heir of gods, aLord of Light.” In discussing this majorachievement, Crowley wrote in The Equinox 1,no. 1:“ The AugoeidesLytton calls him Adonai in ‘Zanoni,’ andI often use this name in the note-books. Abramelin calls him Holy GuardianAngel. I adopt this:(1) Because Abramelin’s system is sosimple and effective. (2) Because since all theories of theuniverse are absurd it is be er to talk inthe language of one which is patentlyabsurd, so as to mortify the metaphysicalman. (3) Because a child can understand it. Theosophists call him the Higher Self,Silent Watcher, or Great Master. TheGolden Dawn calls him the Genius.Gnostics say the Logos. Egyptians sayAsar Un-nefer. Zoroaster talks aboutuniting all these symbols into the form ofa Lion — see Chaldean Oracles. AnnaKingsford calls him Adonai (Clothedwith the Sun). Buddhists call him AdiBuddha — (says H.P.B.) The Bhagavad-Gita calls him Vishnu (chapter xi.). TheYi King calls him 'The Great Person.'The Qabalah calls him Jechidah. We also get metaphysical analyses of Hisnature, deeper and deeper according tothe subtlety of the writer; for this vision—it is all one same phenomena, variouslycoloured by our varying Ruachs—is, Ibelieve, the first and the last of allSpiritual Experience. For though He isattributed to Malkuth, and the Door ofthe Path of His overshadowing, He isalso in Kether (Kether is in Malkuth,and Malkuth in Kether—“as above, sobeneath”), and the End of the “Path ofthe Wise” is identity with Him. So thatwhile he is the Holy Guardian Angel,He is also Hua, and the Tao. For since Intra Nobis Regnum deI allthings are in Ourself, and all SpiritualExperience is a more or less completeRevelation of Him. Yet it is only in theMiddle Pillar that His manifestation is inany way perfect. The Augoeides invocation is the wholething. Only it is so difficult; one goesalong through all the fifty gates of Binahat once, more or less illuminated, moreor less deluded. But the First and theLast is this Augoeides Invocation.”The Angelic consummation may besymbolized as the great quest for the Sangraal.As the Next Step for humanity, the Angelrepresents the spiritual Sun of consciousness forthe entire human race. The iconography of thisquest is represented in Atu VII of the Tarot, theChariot, which symbolically ties into the SummerSolstice and the Sun’s entry into Cancer:“The canopy of the Chariot is the nightsky-blue of Binah. The pillars are the fourpillars of the Universe, the regimen ofTetra-grammaton. The scarlet wheelsrepresent the original energy of Geburahwhich causes the revolving motion. This chariot is drawn by four sphinxescomposed of the four Kerubs, the Bull, theThe Journal of Thelemic Studies32The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Lion, the Eagle and the Man. In eachsphinx these elements are counter-changed;thus the whole represents the sixteen sub-elements.” 51The Four Kerubim about the chariotrepresent the Watch Towers of the Universe, andare the guardians of the Rosicrucian Vault ofChristian Rosenkreutz that is hidden within theMount of Abiegnus, the Mystical Mountain ofInitiation. The Seven sides of this Vault refer tothe Seven Lettered Name of the Great Goddessthat is the center of all devotion. What is theVault of Christian Rosenkreutz, but the very yoniof the Queen of Heaven? It is to this that theKnight-Monk carries his Sacred Lance of worshipacross the deserts of the Abyss. In a footnote Crowley discusses theHebrew letter cheth associated with the Chariotas being a further glyph of the entire GreatWork. The enumeration of cheth in full (tyx)has the value of 418, a key number of Thelema.One of the primary correspondences isABRAHAD-ABRA, the Word of the Aeon, asymbol of the completion of the Great Work,and the formula of its Accomplishment. Theassociation of Atu VII to Cancer further alludesto the symbolism of this Aeonic formula, as theuniting of the 5 (Man) and 6 (God) in the HolyHexagram, and the radiant solar-phallic glory ofthe Rose Cross which blooms therein. This unionis represented by the Holy Hexagram,symbolized by the astrological glyph of Cancer,as discussed in Chapter 69 of the Book of Liesand the accompanying commentary. The vision of the 12th Aeythr (LOE) fromLiber 418 records the rich tapestry of symbolismfor Atu VII. The Charioteer is described aswearing golden armour, which may be seen assymbolic of the achievement of Tiphareth and51The Book of Thoth.the rapturous union with the Holy GuardianAngel. Having achieved the Knowledge andConversation, the Adept is then in possession ofthe Sacred Lance which must be dedicatedwholly to the service of Nuit. The journeycontinues across the Abyss, as the rider sets hiseyes steadily on the prize across the vast desert ofNight—towards Zion (nwyc = 156), the City of thePyramids. Central to the Chariot card is the image ofthe Sangraal. It is said that this jeweled cup isfilled with the “blood of Saints.” The crimsonblood is the King Scale of Colour attributed tothe sephira Binah, the Great Mother, showing theAtziluthic influence. It is Her sacred Womb inwhich this Holy Grail is a reflection, as every lastdrop of blood is to be spilled unto Her—the verylife essence of the initiate given over to Her love.It is said that in order to fully enter Her, thesolar-phallic Angel itself must be abandoned, orrather given over entirely to Her embrace, asevery last seed of starry fire is given to Her. Of this Cup of Blood it is said that “This isthe Mystery of Babylon, the Mother ofabominations, and this is the mystery of heradulteries, for she hath yielded up herself toeverything that liveth, and hath become apartaker in its mystery. And because she hathmade herself the servant of each, therefore is shebecome the mistress of all.” The formula ofBABALON is that of “constant copulation orSamadhi on Everything.”52From the Book of Thoth we read:“The central and most important feature ofthe card is its centre—the Holy Grail. It is ofpure amethyst, of the colour of Jupiter, butits shape suggests the full moon and theGreat Sea of Binah.In the centre is radiant blood; the spiritual52Liber 418, 12th Aethyr.The Journal of Thelemic Studies33The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"life is inferred; light in the darkness. Theserays, moreover, revolve, emphasizing theJupiterian element in the symbol.”The Adept’s journey is one of embracingthe totality of Babalon, a formula of Love underWill which unites everything with its opposite.This act of constant copulation is an opening upto the primordial self-awareness of reality, aluminous state of consciousness that is entirelypresent in every moment. The Graal is noneother than the sacred vessel of Our Lady theScarlet Woman, the Mother of Abominations,the bride of Chaos, that rideth upon our Lordthe Beast53 —that Victorious Queen that we doknow and love in the name BABALON:“Blessed are the saints, that their blood ismingled in the cup, and can never beseparate any more. For Babylon theBeautiful, the Mother of abominations,hath sworn by her holy kteis, whereofevery point is a pang, that she will not restfrom her adulteries until the blood ofeverything that liveth is gathered therein,and the wine thereof laid up and maturedand consecrated, and worthy to gladdenthe heart of my Father . . .And this is the comedy of Pan, that isplayed at night in the thick forest.

The great Graal Quest carries on intoeternity, towards Her sacred starry womb, bloodsoaked and radiating with the fiery light of theRosy Cross. Central to the tenet of Thelema is that noone may know the formula by which any man’sGod is found. Others may help show the wayand give advice based on their own experience;however, the core mystery is always unique,individual, and highly personal. The invocationof the Hidden God may only truly be foundwithin. How more so then is the worship ofBabalon individual and secret? Not for the sakeof any oaths is Her love kept so close and dear,although these too may play a part in Herdevotions. The Love of Babalon is all consuming,all embracing. It touches upon every aspect ofour life, to the very core of our existence. InBabalon is all power, even as in the Hindutantras Shakti is said to be the animating force ofthe universe, for “without Shakti, Shiva isShava.”55To worship Babalon is to give oneselfentirely to experience the Divine in the presenceof every moment. In this way the true Vault ofthe Rosicrucians is found within, and the openingof its central shrine is the entering into union withHer, to experience the naked, awful, andbeautiful reality of pristine, primordial self-awareness. To know Babalon is to awaken to theluminous radiance of pure consciousness. How does one give everything to55“Shava” means “dead, inert.”Babalon? How does every last drop of bloodpour into Her Grail? In what way can “constantcopulation” be practically worked? The Oath ofthe Magister Templi includes the clause “I willinterpret every phenomenon as a particulardealing of God with my soul.” With greatadvantage we can practice this attitude longbefore holding this grade and without taking theoath. God may be replaced with “Holy GuardianAngel,” Adonai, Babalon— whatever aspect ofthe divine calls to the individual. Trying to gothrough the day with this point of view willrender even the most seemingly insignificant actsand events pregnant with deeper meaning,helping to awaken the correct point of view.Awareness of the self is key in this practice. Thegreat dzogchen guru Namkhai Norbu expressesa similar practice in Advice on Presence andAwareness:“[T]he continuation in the presence of thetrue State is the essence of all the Paths,the root of all meditations, the conclusionof all spiritual practices, the juice of allesoteric methods, the heart of all ultimateteachings, it is necessary to seek tomaintain a continuous presence withoutbecoming distracted. What this means is:don’t follow the past, don’t anticipate thefuture, and don’t follow illusory thoughtsthat arise in the present; but turning withinoneself, one should observe one’s owntrue condition and maintain the awarenessof it just as it is...”Babalon is the totality of consciousness—isthe primordial self-aware mind. She is thebeginning and the end of all paths, and the verypath itself. Working with Liber Astarte is anothersuitable practice to help direct the intensedevotions of bhakti yoga towards the Mother ofAbominations in Her many outer forms.The primordial consciousness weaves theThe Journal of Thelemic Studies35The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"fabric of all experience, and we are all Herchildren and of Her substance. Still, it is in theform of woman that She is most accessible.Psychologically She may be the anima, thataspect of the unconscious that touches upon thedarkest, remotest unknown depths of the mind.Consider all women, and in particular those youhave loved, and see the Beautiful One lookingback at you with Her eyes. Let every “breath,every word, every thought, every deed”56 be anact of love with Her. This practice was developedextensively in the Hindu tantras:“Women are divinity, women are life,women are truly jewels.” 57“Women are heaven; women are dharma;and women are the highest penance.Women are Buddha; women are theSantha; and woman are the perfection ofWisdom.” 58In the tantras, physical and visualizedworship of women as the personification ofShakti is a primary practice. Such rituals may beadapted to use for the worship of Babalon, andare in many ways similar to the tantric aspects ofThe Book of the Law. Are we not enjoined tocome before the Goddess of Infinite Space andInfinite Stars wearing only a single robe, andcovered in a rich headdress? To worship Heronly, in Her secret temple, the starlit heavens ofNu? The full worship of Babalon may be alevel of awareness that is far beyond what we arecapable of now.

X.he following considers the abovequotation in light of its connection toThe Gnostic Mass - the furnishings,weapons and even “The Creed” itself beingclearly alluded to. TIn The Gnostic Mass, the Priest, armedwith the consecrated Wand or Lance “thronesthe Priestess upon the Altar.” The word“thrones” connects the Mother (hTetragrammaton, signifying hnyb) with theQueen who is represented as throned in theCourt Cards of the Tarot. Moreover, this verticalaction, from the Tomb to the High Altar,suggests an identity of the Mother with theDaughter, the “Mystic Reading” of the Hebrewletter Heh in full being: “The Mother is theDaughter; and the Daughter is the Mother.”60The double h‘s of the four-fold word are furtheridentified with the Sephiroth (emanations) in TheVision and the Voice: “Malkuth shall be upliftedand set upon the throne of Binah.”6160See 777 and Other Qabalistic Writings by Aleister Crowley.61Liber 418, 4th Aethyr.Additionally, An Essay upon Numberasserts: “I wish to be set upon the throne ofBinah my supernal mother” is the “qabalisticequivalent” of “the Christian conception”: “I ama fallen creature. I wish to be redeemed.” It is theweapon of Earth, the Pentacle (h final) or Patenborne by the Virgin in The Gnostic Mass, whichactivates this process of Redemption: “With theCoin redeemeth He.”62 In the New Æon, this“Earthy component” is reinterpreted as activeand elastic: “rebounding, whirling forth, cryingaloud!”63The Cherubic beast of h final is the Bull(Taurus), the throne of the Hierophant in Atu V:“All mythologies contain this Mystery of theWoman [Priestess] and the Beast [Priest] as theHeart of the Cult.”64 According to Liber Aleph,the Bull is associated to the Will (),Karma Yoga, the Hierophant and the Phallus:62Liber B vel Magi, verse 10.63The Book of Thoth.64Liber 418, note to the 16th Æthyr.The Journal of Thelemic Studies38The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"“And in the Rites of Mithras65 the Bull is slain,and his Blood poured upon the Initiate, toendow him with that Will and that Power toWork.” Notably, both the “Lord Meithras” andthe “Lord Phallus” are invoked, the latter being“hailed” as well, by the Priest in the “Ceremonyof the Opening of the Veil.” Associated to thethrone, the Altar is also “the fixed Will of theMagician,” as the Pantacle symbolizes his Karma.Again, this earthy element is notrepresented as static, but dynamic - the “actualGod worshipped (☉ in the North) has progressedfrom ♉, the laborious slain Bull of Mithras, to ♊,the Children Ra-Hoor-Khuit and Hoor-paar-kraat.”66 Similarly, the elemental associations ofthe East and North quarters (Air and Earthrespectively) have reversed with the advent of theNew Æon.67 According to Skeats Etymological Dic-tionary, the word throne is derived from theGreek word , “a seat; lit. a support,” andhas a value of 499, the same value that Crowleygives for , “the movement; themotion.”68 A “support” in turn connects thethrone to Samekh, the fifteenth Hebrew letter, “aprop” or support, and the vertical path leadingfrom Yesod (☾) to Tiphareth (☉) on the Tree ofLife.

This change isparticularly notable when comparing the Greater Ritual ofthe Pentagram and Liber V.68The Greek Qabalah.stability (fixed) are reconciled. The Altar is further connected to theMother by its crimson color (Binah in the KingsScale of color), which suggests blood. Remember that the vertical component of thehigh Altar is 44 inches and that this number isthat of Horus (Md or blood in Hebrew) – as wellas of hyh) (the Kether-name of God and MysticNumber of Tiphareth).69 While the vertical pathof Samekh connects Sol with Luna - the pathabove it, Gimel, The High Priestess (i.e. thePriestess set upon “the summit of the earth”)formulates “a direct connection between theFather [Kether] in his highest aspect, and the Sonin his most perfect manifestation [Tiphareth].”70 Significantly, Crowley identifies the throneto the Hebrew letter Vau: “the Heart mustsupport and admit the lordship of the higherconsciousness of the magician.”71 Vau, whichmeans a “nail,” may in turn indicate theMercurial Dagger72 or tip of the Sacred Lance,Spear or Phallus, which “pierces the heart of theDying God.”73 As indicated with the oriel behindthe main figure of Atu V, the nail may also fix. In connection to the Altar it is noteworthythat the principal perfume of Gimel is menstrualblood – “the symbolical vehicle of the solar light”– and that blood is the final ingredient listed forthe composition of Cakes of Light or Paten andHosts.74 This symbolism connects the “bestblood” of Liber AL III:24 (Gimel) with the blood“plunged into the side or heart of the Magicianto fill the Holy Cup”(Tiphareth).75 Additionally,69See “From Gold Forge Steel” in Beauty and Strength:Proceedings of the Sixth Biennial National Ordo TempliOrientis Conference.70The Book of Thoth.71777 Revised.72Liber ABA, Part 3, ch.4 and The Book of Lies, ch.2.73Liber 418, note to the 23rd Æthyr.74777 Revised, col.

The Priestess, once throned upon the Altar,holds The Book of the Law “open on her breastwith her two hands, making a descendingtriangle with thumbs and forefingers.” This“descending triangle” is the special sign of Horus,and is specifically connected to the Altar: “It isthe flame descending upon the altar, and lickingup the burnt offering”87 (emphasis mine).88Similarly, an “offering” is specifically identified inpart V of The Gnostic Mass when the Priesttouches the Priestess “between the breasts and onthe body”: “Let this offering be borne upon thewaves of Æthyr to our Lord and Father the Sunthat travelleth over the Heavens in his nameON.”89 Now below the Altar is the dais of threesteps, and it is with the Priests mounting of thethird and final step that he first invokes “ourLord in the Universe the Sun” to “appear Thouglorious upon the throne of the Sun.” This latterinjunction is a paraphrase of Crowley’sversification of the Stélé 666 itself: “Appear onthe throne of Ra.” It is not the Priest, identified as a Master85John St. John.86Commentary to Liber LXV.87“In the end he shall offer up the Vast Sacrifice, at themoment when the God licks up the flame upon the altar.”(Liber Stellæ Rubeæ, verse 30).88One of the sacrificial demarcations between the worshippersof Jehovah in the Torah and their neighbors was theinsistence that the principal offering be burnt.

In particular, after the Priestmakes five crosses on the Priestess, he declares:“Accept, O Lord, this sacrifice of life and joy,true warrants of the Covenant of Resurrection”(emphasis mine). Relatedly, consider LiberA’ash vel Capricorni verse 7: “Set is his holycovenant...” And again, in The Star Sapphire:“Also Set shall appear in the Circle... it is not hethat shall arise [resurrect] in the Sign of IsisRejoicing.” In some Egyptian myths the god Setis portrayed as Horus' older brother rather thanuncle (“Whereof our Father is but the youngerbrother”). Moreover, Crowley identifies Set95with Yod of Tetragrammaton (paired with Isis asHeh) in his “impression” to Liber V vel Reguli.As Crowley indicates in his commentary to LiberLXV III:7, such an interpretation is at odds withtraditional Egyptian theogony.90 And in relation to his body and mind he is but a vehicle ofthe forces that are beyond the Abyss.

It’s also perhaps noteworthy that theHebrew equivalents of the letters CUP are p + w+ k = 106 = n in full = ♏. Scorpio, which isruled by Mars, is associated to the MagicalFormula , whose Magical Weapon is theCup and Cross of Suffering (i.e. theircombination) and the Wine.112 Crowley notesthat this attribution of the “Serpent is connectedwith several of the magical weapons, and impliesthe secret kingly power of the magician, theessence of the phallic energy as employed intransmutation.” Regarding this “transmutation”, itis the Eagle or hawk that drops upon the head ofthe aspirant “an healing dew” with each bite ofthe serpent. Additionally, the three letters of thisweapon may signify the three wands of theAdept and their corresponding Sephira.

For example,name of the “House” the Altar is orientedtowards is 418 in numeration or tyx in full,whose Tarot attribution is The Chariot (AtuVII).115 The principal figure of this card bearsthe Holy Graal, which is “the sacred vessel” ofBabalon and the Chariot itself is composed of thefigure of the Sun and Moon conjoined.116 In anearly version the 3 of Cups, “Babalon” is “in theChariot of Chaos, bearing the Graal.” Accordingto Helena and Tau Apiryon: “We know fromCrowley's other writings that “the sole viceregentof the Sun upon Earth” refers to the PHALLUS,which is, therefore, to be identified with thename CHAOS.” Whereas the Man undergoes Resurrection(the Ordeal of the Neophyte Initiation) from theTomb or Pastos within the Pyramid117 via the113 The General Principles of Astrology.114 Liber Stellæ Rubeæ, verse 69.115 Astrological Cancer associated to the extreme northerndeclination.116 i.e., The Mark of the Beast.117 “The metaphor of stones is, on the other hand, ofagency of the Sword (the “forked lightning” ofAtu XVI) in the hand of the Priestess in TheGnostic Mass, the “fallen daughter” is redeemedvia the agency of the Lance, which is identifiedwith the Phallus (see also Liber AL I:37). ThisLance transcends time, being born “again andagain” - “I am Yesterday, To-Day and theBrother of To-Morrow.” 118 The Wand is in the“Light & in the Night” – “For though I be joinedto the Earth, In the Innermost Shrine of Heavenam I.”119 The Lance is that “Lord” which boththe male (Chokmah) and female (Binah) adoreand then invoke – being One, “present amongus.” For the formula of the Wand, unlike that ofthe Cup, encompasses the entire MinutumMundum – it is both “our Lord in the Universe”(Solar;”Pyramid of Fire”) and “our Lord inourselves”(“the Spiritual Phallus”; “the seedthereof”). Reflecting the Priests movements withinThe Gnostic Mass Temple: “The first formula isthat of the Wand. In the sphere of the principlewhich the Magician wishes to invoke, he risesfrom point to point in a perpendicular line, andthen descends.”120 The Adeptus has seized theSacred Lance. Bacchus (Tiphareth) has becomePan signifying “Occult puberty.”121 Hisdestination on ascending, the “Unveiling of theLight,” is the Altar whereupon is concealed theGraal. In The Gnostic Mass, the Priestess “takesthe lance, between her open hands, and runsthem up and down upon the shaft eleven times,very gently” at the conclusion of part III of theritual.

The following two affirm the“communion of Saints” and the “Miracle of theThe Journal of Thelemic Studies45The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass Horizon Lodge, Ordo Templi Orientis - Seattle, WA.Photograph by Sean Hester, used with permission."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Mass”, these being the essential products of theMass. The final two acknowledge parallelsbetween Liber XV and one’s life.I find myself impelled to address threequestions. Firstly, what does the recitation of theCreed accomplish? Secondly, why should it beincluded in the Mass? Lastly, as it pertains to theCreed, how does belief fit into the anti-superstitious frameworks of Thelema andScientific Illuminism?In any group endeavor, it is wise to ensurethat everyone is on the same page. The Creedserves as a bridge to a conceptual commons: theholy of holies, where earth and sky meet(“Greeting of Earth and Heaven”, as the Priestesssays). It is thus an evocative reality-mappingexercise, potentiating a gestalt that enhances theintimacy of the Mass and entrains thecongregants to a common frame of reference.The Qabalistic basis of the Creed isevident in its use of Tetragrammaton and thesupernals. “The ineffable LORD” describesKether, the Unqualified Absolute orUnconditioned Being; “the sole viceregent of theSun upon the earth”, CHAOS, is a name ofChokmah; and BABALON symbolizes Binah,Earth, and Womb. The centrality of generativepowers to the Creed – namely, the supernal pairand their synthesis in BAPHOMET – connotesolar phallicism and sex magick. The Gnostic,Catholic, ecclesiastical, and eucharistic aspects ofLiber XV are addressed in clauses 3-6. Thepenultimate clause references BAPHOMET bythe term “Baptism of Wisdom”, identifying sex asthe key to the “Miracle of Incarnation” inunambiguously sex-positive language. The finalclause posits a transcendent Self unrestricted bytime and space, pointing to the doctrines of soul,reincarnation, and metempsychosis.These overlapping contexts speak to adistinctive set of values that is at odds withinstitutional patriarchy. Reciting the Creed is afirm rejection of slave morality. Clause 4 states,“And I believe in one Gnostic and Catholicchurch of light, life, love, and liberty, the word ofwhose law is Thelema”. In that Thelema (Will) iscoterminous with self-determination, verbalizingthe Creed is a potent symbolic act of rebellionagainst oppressive old aeon doctrines – and, byproxy, dogmatic theology and institutionalreligion. It is accurate to view it as an invocationof Horus.Bearing these considerations in mind, theCreed is appropriately sequenced. Thecongregation front-loads themselves with anarrative that triggers an altered state ofconsciousness and contextualizes the rest of theritual. This is arguably in the vein of neuro-linguistic programming and self-hypnosis, andLiber XV proceeds upon the vibrant foundationlaid thereby.The word “belief” remains saddled withthe fetters of religious dogma. The method ofscience demands skepticism, not blind faith – butone must be wary of confusing skepticism withcynicism. The former connotes an open-mindedsuspension of judgment and credulity, the latter apredisposition to denial or apathy. The former isa scientific attitude; the latter is bias. Whilegrounding the Creed’s articles of belief in ascientific cosmogony, its twilight language excitesthe imagination, informing and enhancing asuprarational ritual state. It is undesirable for themind to recoil at figurative language ormetaphor.Under the paradigm of ScientificIlluminism, belief is a programmatic tool.Memorizing the tables of correspondence in 777establishes a specialized cognitive superstructure(i.e. a neural network in the brain) that respondsto ritual stimuli as a prerequisite to practicingThe Journal of Thelemic Studies46The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"ceremonial magick.

The Creed, beingsimple, straightforward, and based onrudimentary and easily observable scientificconcepts, lends itself primarily to three particularapproaches in writing about it: the first beingelaborate paraphrases of what is already explicit,the second being illustrations of personalepiphanies which may or may not be relevant tothe experience of those outside the area of effectof said epiphanies (and which we must accept aspossessing varying degrees of comprehensibilityand/or sanity), and the third being practicalexaminations regarding the function and utility ofthe Creed as serving and advancing the formulaIof the Mass in general. Of the three aforementioned approaches,the second is the only one that is likely to containmuch original thought or material. Since it is notmy purpose here (nor is it my interest) to imposeor proliferate my personal interpretations of anyportion of the Mass, I am going to make aconscious effort to refrain entirely fromemploying the second approach, avoidsomewhat (although not entirely) the firstapproach, and focus primarily on the third. In the final analysis, it is much better thatexplanations of things be useful than that they beoriginal or even interesting. While I hope that thereader will find this essay interesting, it is myutmost aspiration that they will find it useful.Part 1: The Functions of the Creed inside the Mass1.1: To Synchronize the Conceptual Componentof the People In my limited experience of EGCcommunities, it is customary for the Deacon togive a short speech or preamble to the Peopleprior to admitting them into the Mass temple.This speech consists of a number of instructionsregarding temple decorum and verbal/gesturalparticipation, which the People are expected tofollow as a courtesy to the rest of the participants,and to the officers of the Mass. Participation on this level is understood tobe involuntary and required for admission intothe temple, and does not assume or require anyunderstanding of the necessity or function of theinstructions. Furthermore, it is accepted thatunderstanding of the specific import of theseinstructions (steps, signs, attitudes, etc.) is not anecessary requirement for understanding theformula of the Mass itself. For this reason, it ispossible to regard participation on this level to bepassive in nature, and to be concerned primarilywith synchronizing the behavioral component ofThe Journal of Thelemic Studies48The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"the People. Similar to the Deacon’s speech beforeadmittance, the Creed is also a preamble tosubsequent events. However, rather than beingdesigned to enforce involuntary uniformity on averbal and gestural level, its purpose is toillustrate the fundamental principles which makepossible the fulfillment of the formula of theMass and to verbally confirm the Peoples’ activebelief in them. Understanding or agreement with theseprinciples is not explicitly required for one to beadmitted into the temple, but sincere andinformed agreement with the principles of theCreed is a prerequisite to understanding orbenefiting from the formula of the Mass. For thisreason, it is possible to regard the recitation ofthe Creed (as one eventually comes tounderstand its principles) as being active innature and to be concerned primarily withsynchronizing the conceptual component of thePeople.1.2: To Amplify Harmonious Thought/Intent; ToIsolate and Banish Disharmonious Thought/Intent In any group ritual it is important that thethoughts and intent of the participants besynchronized and amplified within the confinesof the temple and that disharmonious thoughtsand intent be isolated and/or banished from thesame confines. The Mass is designed to be a public ritual,open to all, and as such its participants andofficers cannot be assured at all times thateveryone in attendance has a sufficient grasp of(or sufficient agreement with) the formulacommunicated through it, nor can they allow thatto be a necessary requirement for the success ofthe ritual. The recitation of the Creed, aloud andin unison, provides the participants and officerswith a necessary, primary, and effectivesafeguard against disharmony, distraction, anddisruption of the current of energy that is beingchanneled through this formula, and of thesuccess of the Mass itself. In order to understand the importance ofthe recitation of the Creed in providing thisamplification/isolation, it is useful once again tocontrast the recitation of the Creed with thereception of the preliminary speech beforeentering the temple. The reception of the speech does not relyon active contributions from the People in orderto be successful. In order to fulfill the purpose ofthis speech, it is only necessary that they listen towhat is being said to them, and follow theappropriate instructions at the appropriate timesonce inside the temple. While they are certainlywelcome to ask any questions that may enhancetheir understanding of the details before enteringthe Temple, they are not required to do so. The recitation of the Creed, on the otherhand, engages the People in an active, public,and decisive (at least within the temple)statement of Belief and Confession. For allpractical intents and purposes, we can assumethat any questions they may have about any ofthe principles they are affirming through thisrecitation have been (or will be) settledelsewhere.The Creed is recited aloud and in unison.Admittedly, this is the most common mode ofpublic recitation for any kind of groupaffirmation, but it is more than simpleconvenience that makes this mode of publicrecitation useful in a magickal sense, as will beexamined in the following paragraphs. In magickal ritual, as in other arenas ofcommunication and interaction, the spoken wordis one of the most powerful forms of invocationThe Journal of Thelemic Studies49The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"(second only to the written word in the publicarena). We can think about things as much as welike, and perform any number or variety ofthought experiments in connection with anynumber or variety of subjects, and never have tocommit to them anything other than whatevertime or energy it took to entertain the thoughts inthe first place. It is not necessary to engage anycritical portion of one’s personal integrity oridentity in the subject of the unspoken theoreticalconstruct in order to treat it in a satisfactoryfashion. With the spoken word, however,especially in a public arena, the very act ofspeaking engages the personal integrity of thespeaker and binds them--to a degreecommensurate with their level of personalintegrity--to a personal identification with thesubjects of the statements in accordance withtheir grammatical structure. Reciting aloud also fulfills completely thefunction of isolating disharmonious thoughts orintents from the confines of the temple. Since theact of speaking engages the speaker on thegrounds of their integrity and identity, the act ofspeaking also creates a condition where the otherparticipants need not be concerned with anydisharmonious thoughts (that remain unspoken)within the mind of the speaker. Therefore, theverbal buffer created by such recitationeffectively absorbs these disharmonious elementsand is sufficient to insulate any single participantfrom the possibly wandering or conflictedthoughts of any other participant. The operantsupposition here is: if it wasn’t spoken, it does notoperate within the confines of the temple, and isthus irrelevant or nonexistent. Likewise, recitation in unison forms aninstant synergistic relationship with all otherparticipants in the temple in that it serves tosynchronize and amplify the thoughts and intentprojected through the recitation. If reciting aloudis sufficient to project a thought or intent andestablish its dominion in the temple, recitingaloud and in unison is sufficient to effectivelyamplify the intensity of the thought projectionand its dominion in the temple by a factor equalto the number of participants in the temple andto channel this projection into the fulfillment ofthe formula of the Mass through theconcentration of the individual (and group) will,in accordance with the principles affirmed in theCreed.Part 2: The Operant Terms in the Creed: Belief and ConfessionThe next questions that naturally arise inthe course of this analysis are: What exactly arethese principles? What are the operant terms inthese statements of affirmation, and how do theyserve to affirm the various principles in theCreed, in accordance with the grammaticalstructure of the statements?Other essays have been written regardingthe former, and they are far more eloquent andinformative than I would expect anything that Ihave to say on the subject to be. Furthermore,since it is not my intent in this essay to explorethat question, I will leave that labor to the writersof those other essays and concentrate myenergies upon the latter. There are eight statements of affirmationin the Creed. Six of them are qualified by theoperant term of Belief, and two of them arequalified by the operant term of Confession. Inorder to determine how these operant termsserve to affirm the various principles of theCreed, we must examine the meanings of thesewords, and how they relate to the various classesof phenomena identified in the statementsThe Journal of Thelemic Studies50The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"themselves. Definitions (excerpted fromdictionary.com) are as follows:Believe: \\Be*lieve”\\, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Believed;p. pr. & vb. n. Believing.] 1.

To make acknowledgment or avowal ina matter pertaining to one’s self;Now that we have our definitions, it ispossible to examine how these terms operate invalidating the various statements of affirmation inthe Creed. The first six statements refer to occultrepresentations of generally accepted phenomenasuch as certain natural processes and theexistence and function of certain heavenlybodies. Since we do not have direct experienceof any of these things, it is necessary for us toaccept them on the faith that they exist andfunction as described according to the best andmost current scientific knowledge. Belief in this capacity engages all three ofthe listed definitions of the term. We credit thesethings upon the testimony of others (i.e., we arenot all astronomers, so we have not all done thenecessary work to satisfy ourselves independentlyof the existence of the sun; we are not allbiologists, so we have not done the necessarywork to likewise satisfy ourselves of themicroscopic appearance and behavior ofspermatozoa, etc.) because as a society we haveaccumulated a body of scientific knowledge thatis sufficient to bear out these postulates. Theexistence of this body of scientific knowledgeempowers us to persuade ourselves of the truthof these statements through informed reasons,arguments, and deductions of the mind. The factthat all of the subjects dealt with in these sixstatements (if considered outside of their occulttrappings) are accepted by all educated people tobe rudimentary and fairly self-evident (in light ofthe current state of scientific research) allows usto regard and accept them as true with little orno conscious effort. Since it is impossible even for scientistswith highly specialized training to have directknowledge and experience of the subjects theyanalyze and study, the best orientation that they(or we) can truthfully claim toward any of them isthat of informed belief. The first six statements ofaffirmation in the Creed, being statements onsubjects of this order, thus could not be truthfullyqualified by any other operant term than that ofBelief, which makes it ideal as an operant term,and validates indisputably the statements inwhich it operates. The final two statements in the Creedrefer respectively to the phenomena of Birth andLife. Since these are phenomena that every livingbeing has a direct and (to a greater or lesserdegree) intimate connection with through directexperience, it is not necessary to qualify themthrough a term such as Belief. Even without avast corpus of scientific knowledge to bear it out,one can easily and confidently acknowledge thatthey were born and that they are indeed alive atthe moment of acknowledgment.Acknowledgment in this fashion engages thelisted definition of the term “Confess.”The Journal of Thelemic Studies51The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"In ClosingIn any magickal operation, it is necessaryto have one’s postulates and observations readilyat hand, so that one may rally them to one’s useeffortlessly and seamlessly.

The Nicene Creed,131 with its historicalplacement in regard to our own antecedents andits similar syntactic structure, shares a number ofobvious touchstones with the creed of EcclesiaGnostica Catholica132 which further highlight thedoctrinal differences. Some of these points comeso close that the EGC Creed (EGCC) can beviewed as a response to or possibly a rectificationof that which has in its various permutationsserved as an explicit foundation for many of themajor threads of Christian churches. “Let the evilones be cast away; let the good ones be purgedby the prophet!”133 apparently extends beyondrituals to the broader case of statements of belief,as well. OThe first three statements of belief in theEGCC outline primary entities which form thehighest level of reality, as both physical andmetaphysical structures: Chaos, Babalon, andBaphomet. This inter-related triplicity bearscorrespondence to the Nicene Creed's (NC)depiction of God the father, Mary/Holy Spirit themother, and Jesus the son. For the creative force of the universe, the131 Committee of Divine Worship of the United StatesConference of Catholic Bishops, “Textus translationispartium quarundam Ordinis Missae Missalis Romani, exeditio typica tertia eiusdem excerptarum, lingua anglicaexaratus,” page 9.132 Liber XV: The Gnostic Mass.133 Liber AL, II:5.EGCC describes the hierarchical descent fromthe general to the particular, starting from itssecret and unspeakable, perhaps involuted,source. Though one among many on the granderscale, the Sun, to us humans, is the most primalmanifestation of that force, whose presence onEarth (named Chaos) is the pervasive mystery oflife itself as the sole executor of the Sun's power.The most particular and least rarified evidence ofthis force is the air-driven process of metabolicrespiration. We see this descent reflected in thedownward traversal of the Qabalistic Tree ofLife's middle pillar (LORD = Kether, Sun =Tiphareth, Chaos = Yesod, and Air = Malkuth)as well as in the letters comprising the ineffablename itself (hwhy).This is a rather detailed metaphysic whencompared to the NC's elucidation of the creativeprinciple as God the Father, who is very simplydescribed as being the unassailable source of allthings manifest and transcendent, period. Theelaborate description is saved for Jesus, the Son.Of his life little mention is made, but his birth,death, and resurrection as well as the specifics ofwhy people ought to care about him arethoroughly described. In contrast, thecorresponding principle in the EGCC,Baphomet, is depicted only to the extent that heis the “Serpent and the Lion.” Outside the creedbut within the context of “Liber XV,” this lion-snake pairing is further contextualized as beingthe father of the Gnostic Catholic saints as well asthe ones who “destroy the destroyer” as theThe Journal of Thelemic Studies53The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"consecrated elements are mixed.134Both Baphomet and Jesus fulfill the role ofthe being the issue of the Father and Mother.The NC places special emphasis on the notionthat Jesus was not “made” but “begotten” of thefather and the mother, ostensibly to promulgatethe understanding that he was a man rather thana purely spiritual being. The same holds forBaphomet who is begotten, not made, from themingling of the body and blood in the cup.However, the purpose for Jesus' manifestation isso that he can suffer sacrifice and then resurrecthimself for the everlasting life of the fallenmankind. As a perfect inversion and rectificationof this formula, Baphomet is born as therevivification of man's sacrifice of life and joy,identifying the Priest and Priestess as the divineoperants themselves, Chaos and Babalon. Jesuswas born to suffer; Baphomet is a joy to beget. The Mother provides another set of cleardistinctions. Jesus is begotten by God the Fatheron a virgin, Mary, with the implication that this isthe sort of purity required in order to serve as asuitable vessel for God's holy issue, the baptismfor the forgiveness of sins. Babalon, however, farfrom being virginal (for the common uses of“virginal,” at any rate), is an indiscriminatewhore, the mother of us all who gives her wombto all takers who are willing to offer in ecstasy afinal sacrifice of their last drop of blood.135 As thebearer of Babalon's cup in the Gnostic Mass, thePriestess begins as a simple virgin who afterinvoking the Priest is then “upraised” by himthrough acts of sexual congress into hersanctified form as the whore who is then suited tobear the offspring wrought of the sacrifice of lifeand joy in the baptism of wisdom. On a scope encompassing the respectivespiritual engines arising from these triplicities, we134Liber XV: The Gnostic Mass.135 See The Vision & the Voice, especially the 12th Aethyr.see still larger differences in function and aim ofthe two creeds. Stated only tacitly within its text,Original Sin is the quiet architect of the NC.Each point is carefully struck to delineate thatGod and man are very separate, one being all-powerful and the other weak; that his kingdom inHeaven is eternal, though man and his world arenot; that salvation comes from submission to anauthority outside the imperfect and ephemeralself. The EGCC depicts a radically differentreality where man is God; where the proclaimantis himself ageless and eternal, perpetuating theworld through the promulgation of his perfectwill; an individual in the company of thoseinspired by the virile Holy Spirit that moved the“saints of the true church of old time” to carrythe gnosis from its primordial origin into ourcurrent day, and onward; and a miraculousidentity between the process that fires our brains,muscles, and gametes and that which connects usas producers and partakers of the transcendent.The Journal of Thelemic Studies54The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Gnostic Catholic Creed:Seeds of Self-Knowledgeby Frater EnathelemeNote: First published in Lion & Serpent, Vol. VI, Number 2, Anno 97 EN.Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.he word “creed” is defined as a briefauthoritative formula of religious belief.It is also synonymous with religion andideology. The Gnostic Catholic Creed maytherefore be considered a declaration of thebeliefs of the congregation, as well as a symbolicrepresentation of the Ecclesia and of the Massitself. An understanding of this formula maybegin with studying the correspondences of thesymbolism presented line-by-line and from aholistic perspective. Such symboliccorrespondences can be found by examining theqabalistic significance of specific words within thecreed and by relating passages to other symbolsets, including the Tree of Life, the Tarot, andwestern mythologies. In addition, an informalinterpretation of the more readily understoodpassages will be fruitful. While I have attemptedto collect and summarize a wide variety ofinterpretive information here via research, suchdata can only point weakly toward the truemystery, which arises with practice, meditationand visualization. T“I believe in one secret and ineffable LORD;” Throughout the rest of the Creed,Crowley uses all capital letters on words that areeither known to be of Greek or unknown origin,or words to which he applied isopsephy (Greekgematria) in other works. The word “Lord”stands apart from the others, as it is clearly anEnglish word. Nevertheless, the application ofisopsephy to this word, transliterated to theGreek alphabet, reveals layers of meaning. If we resolve the “O” in LORD to theGreek digamma, the total value of the wordbecomes 140. Crowley was occasionally fond ofmaking this liberal transliteration, probablybecause of that letter’s origin in the Phoenicianwaw. Another Greek word, which also adds upto 140, is hdonh, meaning lust, delight, or joy.The implication is that in some way, this LORDis identical with hdonh, and also that hdonh issecret and ineffable. This is an apt association bymy reckoning, especially given the Collect,entitled “The Lord,” which reads as follows: “Lord secret and most holy, source oflight, source of life, source of love, sourceof liberty, be thou ever constant andmighty within us, force of energy, fire ofmotion; with diligence let us ever labourwith thee, that we may remain in thineabundant joy.” 136 What is truly remarkable, however, is thatthe word hdonh (pronounced “hedoneh”) has astriking phonetic similarity to the Hebrew ynd)(“Adonai”), which means, in English, “Lord,”and is used throughout the Bible to refer to thatGod, who is also secret and ineffable. 136 Liber XV, “The Lord” in The Collects.The Journal of Thelemic Studies55The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"This Lord corresponds to Hadit, to Ketheron the Tree of Life, and to the Stélé of Revealingin the Mass.“and in one Star in the company of Stars ofwhose fire we are created, and to which we shallreturn;” It can be argued that Crowley is talkingabout something else here, something separatefrom the secret and ineffable Lord, due to thestructure of the sentence. Also if the Lord issecret and ineffable, then this passage cannot, bydefinition, be a description of it. Throughout theMass, Crowley refers to the Lord in two contexts,and probably means two different things. Forexample, “In the name of our Lord the Sun, andof our Lord ... ,” [sic] where the second “Lord”referred to cannot be named, and an ellipsis isapparently used in place of any name ordescription. (Helena et al., 1995) The description above can refer to thesun, Sol, materially. The sun’s light gives us lifethrough the energy it provides to vegetation,which is the basis of all our nutrition. In this way,we are literally created of the sun’s fire. Ourphysical bodies will return to this source by thesame means, as we are digested by variousinsects that then pass us on to the plants. Theplants then convert our carbon to sugars in theprocess of photosynthesis, where the sun’s firefinally rends our very molecules asunder. A more esoteric interpretation could bethat each of us is a Star in the company of Stars;that we are the Gods of our own creation; thatwe create our bodies and minds and return toour original state after death. This Star corresponds to Ra-Hoor-Khuit,to Aiwass, to the Holy Guardian Angel, toTiphareth on the Tree of Life, and to the Host inthe Mass. The company of Stars of which this Star isa member corresponds to Nuit, to the negativeveils surrounding the Tree of Life, and thePriestess and Paten in the Mass. “and in one Father of Life, Mystery of Mystery,in His name CHAOS, the sole viceregent of theSun upon Earth;” Here Crowley identifies a Thelemic deityby name. Chaos, in Greek, is spelled Caos,which evaluates to 871. Other words that sharethis value include: acos, pain or sorrow;skotaios, secret or dark; faros, a web orcloak; agnizw, to purify; and akwn, “againstone’s will.” These associations may seemconfusing at first or contradictory to the nature ofdeity, but they match well the visions describedin the 14th Aethyr of The Vision and the Voicewhere Chaos speaks to Crowley: “His voice comes in a whisper: O thouthat art master of the fifty gates ofUnderstanding, is not my mother a blackwoman? O thou that art master of thePentagram, is not the egg of spirit a blackegg? Here abideth terror, and the blindache of the Soul, and lo! even I, who amthe sole light, a spark shut up, stand in thesign of Apophis and Typhon. I am the snake that devoureth the spirit ofman with the lust of light. I am thesightless storm in the night that wrappeththe world about with desolation. Chaos ismy name, and thick darkness. Know thouthat the darkness of the earth is ruddy,and the darkness of the air is grey, but thedarkness of the soul is utter blackness.” 137And again in the 4th Aethyr: “Blackness, blackness intolerable, before137 Liber 418, 14th Aethyr.The Journal of Thelemic Studies56The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"the beginning of the light. This is the firstverse of Genesis. Holy art thou, Chaos,Chaos, Eternity, all contradictions interms!” 138To intellectually resolve the seemingcontradiction of finding this dark desolation asthe Father of Life, we can turn to the naturalsciences. As the Father of Life, it makes sensethat His nature would seem to suggest death andan absence of life – for life is born of these thingsin nature. In the physical universe, conservationof energy demands that no energy be lost orgained – there is always the same amount ofenergy in the universe. This being the case, utterdesolation would indicate the absolute maximumin potential energy, without form. This is thebeginning of creation. We can qabalistically verify that He is theFather of Life. This can be done throughpythmenes (Greek aiq beker – adding thenumerals of a word’s value to reach a kind of“root value”) and notariqon (correspondinginitial letters to core concepts). The value ofCaos is 871, which reduces through pythmenesto 7, the value of the letter zeta which,traditionally in Greek notariqon, stands for Zoe(Life). There is one passage in The Vision andthe Voice, which possibly suggests an alternatespelling. While this spelling is certainlyunconventional, it does indicate new depths ofcorrespondence. From the 7th Aethyr: “Now there is a word of four letters thatcontaineth in itself all the mystery of theTetragrammaton, and there is a word ofseven letters which it concealeth, and thatagain concealeth the holy word that is thekey of the Abyss.” 139138 Liber 418, 4th Aethyr.139 Liber 418, 7th Aethyr.There is a good deal of commentary onthis passage, which seem to be summarized infootnote 5:“These words are probably BABALON,ChAOS, TARO.” 140One way that Babalon could concealChaos is if the latter were spelled, in the Hebrew,“sw(k,” totaling 156, the same value as Babalon.These correspondences, along with some furthersuggestions in the commentary on the abovepassage, deserve further research and meditation.According to Crowley, only a Master of theTemple may comprehend the mystery of Chaos.(Crowley, 1997) Chaos corresponds to Chokmah on theTree of Life, and to the Priest in the Mass.Chaos, as viceregent (Priest), performs thefunction of the sun (Holy Guardian Angel)through the medium of the Air (the Lance – seebelow). “and in one Air the nourisher of all thatbreathes.” Air is one of the four Alchemicalelements. The original Greek word is ahr, and itcarries the additional translations of mist andcloud. Without air, no life on earth (that weknow of) could transmute base matter intoenergy. Indeed, the lowest forms of life, such asalgae, all require sunlight and air at a minimumto survive (those that live in water extract oxygenand nitrogen gasses thence). In this physicalsense, nourishment is indeed provided by air toall that breathes. The value of the word is 109, whichcorresponds to Hra (Hera), the second wife (andsister) of Zeus. Hera is known as “The PerfectedOne” and She is known for ultimate and equal140 Liber 418, 7th Aethyr.The Journal of Thelemic Studies57The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"rulership, with Zeus, of the world of the GreekGods and the Earth. Philolaos, a Pythagorean,relates the element of air to Dionysos. Eusebius,bishop of Caesarea, attributed air to Athena.Plato corresponded air to the octahedron, one ofthe five perfect solids. (Barry, 1999) Using pythmenes, the value of the word isreduced to 1. The Greek initial a is traditionallyattributed to air by notariqon, as is the Hebrew). These both have a value of 1. The Greek a isalso the first letter of anatolh (east, sunrise). The one Air corresponds to the path of aon the Tree of Life, to The Fool (Atu 0) in theTarot, and to the Lance in the Mass. Thisfragment concludes the first sentence in theCreed. The four parts of this sentence are allrelated in the sense that they all havepredominantly masculine attributes.“And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all,and in one Womb wherein all men are begotten,and wherein they shall rest, Mystery of Mystery,in Her name BABALON.” The sentence structure in this passage isslightly different than that above. In this case,there are three parts to the sentence, and merecommas rather than semicolons separate eachpart. Therefore, it can be argued that they allrefer directly to Babalon. Still, Crowleycapitalized the initial letters of Earth, Mother, andWomb, which may offer additional hints to thenature of Babalon. Earth, in Greek, is gaia, which evaluatesby isopsephy to 15. Other words sharing thisvalue are: qea, goddess; dia, asunder orthrough; and ei, “thou art.” Pythmenes revealsthat the root value of 15 is 6, which correspondsto abba, or father. This fact (in addition to themysteries of Chaos explored above) may shedsome light on the passage in the Anthem of theMass, which reads, “Male-female, quintessential,one, / Man-being veiled in Woman-form.” Theinitial letter E of Earth probably transliterates tothe Greek h, which in and of itself is a word inGreek meaning “I was.” The meaning of h bynotariqon is, curiously, Hera. The initial letter gof gaia has a value of 3, clearly corresponding toBinah on the Tree of Life. Mother, in Greek, is mhthr, whichevaluates to 456. Curiously, this is exactly 300more than the value of Babalon. Usingpythmenes, we again arrive at the values of 15and 6 (see Earth above). Other words with thevalue of 456 include: metabolh, change;diakaiokrisia, righteous judgment; diobolos,hurled by Zeus; and zeugma, bond. Womb, in Greek, is delqus, whichevaluates to 1139. Another word with this valueis gelwta, laughter. This value does not reduceto 15 or 6, like those above, through pythmenes.Rather, the digits add up to 14, which breaksdown further to 5, the same as the value of `ad,Had or Hadit. Again, this is an ultimatelyfeminine symbol with a fiery and masculineassociation. The number 5 is also related to thesphere of Geburah on the Tree of Life, arguablythe most masculine (but fundamentally feminine)member of the feminine Pillar of Severity. Thisseems appropriate. Of the three concepts, Earth,Mother, and Womb, the latter is the most easilyrelated to generation, a typically (metaphysically)masculine trait. The initial letter W of Wombprobably transliterates to the Greek digamma,which carries the value of 6, thereby maintainingthe connection with Mother and Earth above. Itmay also transliterate to omega, which by itselfmeans the end, or the last, and is symbolic of theseventh heaven of the Christian Gnostics. Babalon is spelled Babalon in Greek,The Journal of Thelemic Studies58The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"and Her value is 156. This number does notappear very remarkable at first glance, as thereare few and relatively meaningless other wordswith the same numerology. Pythmenes gives us12, suggesting the zodiac and the completemacrocosm. Applying pythmenes again, we get3, the number of Binah on the Tree of Life andthe value of the letter g. The meaning of g bynotariqon is gaia (see above) and gennaw, tobeget or to be born. The associations to Earth,Mother, and Womb are clearly evident. Crowley has a great deal to say aboutBabalon in The Vision and the Voice andelsewhere. She bears the cup, and collects theblood of the saints therein. Her consort is Chaos.A beautiful depiction of Babalon can be found inCrowley and Harris’ Thoth Tarot (Atu XI). Babalon corresponds to Binah on the Treeof Life, and the cup in the Mass. “And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion,Mystery of Mystery, in His name BAPHOMET.”The case of Baphomet is a curious one.The word’s origin is unknown. In Crowley’sConfessions he relates the tale of his frustration atnot finding the correct spelling of this name (asno spelling he could devise yielded sufficientlysignificant values by his reckoning), and asking aspirit for guidance. In it, the spirit tells thespelling of Baphomet as it might transliterate tothe Hebrew: rtym(w)b . Using the Hebrewgematria, this adds to 729, which is 93 andcorresponds to Khqas, the name (which literallymeans “stone,” and in this context, the cubicalcornerstone of the Church) that Jesus gave toPeter. The word skaqh, ship or vessel, alsoshares this value.What is odd about this spelling is that itends in resh, which transliterates to the Englishletter “r.” Crowley felt that this spelling resolvedthe etymology of the word, because it has aphonetic similarity to a title meaning “FatherMithras.” (Unfortunately he does not reveal whattitle this might be.) Another etymological theorythat Crowley liked, but which was not supportedby the new spelling, was that Baphomet was acorruption of baqh mhtoes, baptism ofwisdom.141 The name Baphomet dates back at least asfar as the Knights Templar. Other similar deitiesdate back at least as far as the Manicheans andother Christian Gnostics. The ideas thatBaphomet represents have always been thoughtof as evil by dualists who believe that flesh andmatter are manifestations of evil forces.Baphomet represents generation, and any symboldepicting generation or incarnation is inharmony with Him.142 The association of the lion and serpent toBaphomet gives further clues to His nature.There is a Christian Gnostic depiction ofYldaboath as a lion-headed man with a serpentwrapped around Him. Yldaboath, in theChristian Gnostic mythology, is the deityresponsible for the creation of the Earth and itsinhabitants. He was a blind idiot God, who couldnot see the other deities around Him (actuallyabove Him) and therefore mistakenly thought Hewas the only God. Many sects of ChristianGnosticism regarded Him as evil because of Hisessential flaws, and because of the flaws of Hiscreation. However, most Thelemites do notequate flesh and matter as intrinsically evil, sotherefore Baphomet, our equivalent ofYldaboath, is not regarded as evil either. He isthe result of the union of Chaos and Babalon andHe symbolizes the union of opposites. 141 Confessions, chapter 85.142 “The Gnostic Mass with Annotations and Commentary” bySoror Helena and Tau Apiryon.The Journal of Thelemic Studies59The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Baphomet corresponds to Tiphareth onthe Tree of Life, and the Deacon in the Mass. “And I believe in one Gnostic and CatholicChurch of Light, Life, Love and Liberty, theWord of whose Law is THELEMA.” It is doubtful that the potential readers ofthis document will require much elaboration onthe meaning or numerology of the wordqelhma. It means “will” and its value is 93. Thisvalue is shared by agaph, love. That our Church is Gnostic and Catholicsimply means that we believe in direct,unmediated knowledge of deity, and that ourChurch is universal and comprehensive. (SeeDictionary definitions of the terms.) The repetition of the initial letter “L” in“Light, Life, Love and Liberty” draws attention toitself. The value of the letter l is 30, and itsmeaning by notariqon is “lion.” The repetition offour ls gives us a total value of 120, the numberof on (the Greek word for “being” and theEgyptian word for the sun). There is also asymbolic correspondence between these wordsand the hwhy formula: Light = y , Life = h , Love= w , Liberty = h. The Church and the word qelhmacorrespond to Malkuth on the Tree of Life, andthe physical congregation and temple in theMass. “And I believe in the communion of Saints.” Up to this point in the Creed, there seemsto be a kind of chronological cosmologydepicted. The Creed begins with the mostineffable and here we are at the level of the mostphysical. Likewise, the majority of the Massseems to be a pageant depicting the same. At thispoint in the Creed (and in the Mass), the trendbegins to reverse itself in the act of communion. Communion in the Mass consists of eatingthe physical manifestation of Chaos (the body ofGod), and drinking that of Babalon (the blood ofGod). But the wine is also the blood of the Saints– our ancestors. These were individual humanbeings and characters from myth that embodied,in some way, the phallic principle in our culture.Whether Gods, or bards, or mystics, martyrsmythological or literal, or what have you, theSaints listed in the Mass have universally been apositive, generative force in the Western EsotericTradition. That list is far from comprehensive (oreven representative), and it may be argued thatall those who actively participate in our mysticalcurrent will become Saints at death, for we allmust rest in the Womb of our creation. We mustalso return to the Star in the company of Stars.Thereby, in addition to being the body of God,the host in communion may be seen as theSaints’ bodies just as the wine is the blood.This act of communion represents therealization of a spiritual union between thecongregants and the tradition. It also is an act ofsharing between congregants, and stimulatesfeelings of intimate fellowship and rapport –toward each other and toward our predecessorsthe Saints. We are members of their community,and we were before we were born. Communionis communication also, and therefore suggestiveof Knowledge and Conversation with the HolyGuardian Angel. The communion of Saints corresponds tothe path of s, and to the communion in theMass.“And, forasmuch as meat and drink aretransmuted in us daily into spiritual substance, Ibelieve in the Miracle of the Mass.” The Journal of Thelemic Studies60The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Miracle of the Mass occurs in theconsumption and digestion of the Eucharist. Thisis the process whereby we unite opposites withinourselves, taking in Chaos and Babalon tobecome the child, Baphomet. We eat every day, and we unite oppositesconstantly in this way through the very functionof our bodies. Daily we perform transmutation;daily we turn the lead into gold; and daily ouractivities nourish the spirit. It is perhaps theconsciousness of these processes, and theawareness of their relationship to the rest of ourworld, which makes it a miraculous occurrence. This Miracle takes place not at Mass – oreven in the twelve hours it takes to digest thematerials after Mass – but over the course ofyears or even decades, as nutrients are stored,deposits left in arteries, practices observed, andawareness expanded in the body, mind, andspirit. There is no completion to this Miracle.Even after death, the process continues. It is theprocess, and not the result, which is miraculous.It is actually physically miraculous because itrepresents an isolated anomaly at extremevariance with the rest of the known universe. TheSecond Law of Thermodynamics states thatentropy always increases. Perhaps a caveatshould be added for our experience: that asChaos increases, so shall He multiply. The Miracle of the Mass corresponds tothe path of +, and to the moment in the Masswhen the Priest and Priestess cry, “HRILIU!” “And I confess one Baptism of Wisdom wherebywe accomplish the Miracle of Incarnation.” This confession is foreshadowedimmediately prior to the commencement of theCreed, when the congregation performs the stepand sign of Man and Brother, Woman and Sister– the old Masonic step and sign of the firstdegree, symbolizing birth. Physically, there is only one way toaccomplish the Miracle of Incarnation withoutthe intervention of advanced medicaltechnologies. The Baptism of Wisdom is it. Theact of sex is not the terminal meaning of thissymbolism, however, for sex is itself symbolic.Our own Baptism of Wisdom came atconception, but everywhere is conception takingplace. Our thoughts, our actions, our love, everyphysical law of nature and every magickalpractice facilitate the process of intercourse – ofunion. Nevertheless, this passage is far morematerially based than that of Baphomet, which isalso concerned with the union of opposites (notealso the possible etymological relationshipbetween Baphomet and the Baptism of Wisdommentioned above). It is the first of the twoconfessions in the Creed. The word “confession”implies that this is not a metaphysical metaphor,but a physical fact, for to confess is to makesomething known. We are making known thatsexual intercourse alone brings incarnation. Thesymbolic and reverent language of thisconfession of the sex act supports the popularThelemic doctrine that sex and sexualsymbolism are divine, and that sexual taboo isunnecessary. The Baptism of Wisdom corresponds toYesod on the Tree of Life, and to the font in theMass. “And I confess my life one, individual, andeternal that was, and is, and is to come.”After conception and birth, we experiencelife. Each of us is singular, existing as a distinctentity forever. Furthermore, we will forever havea past, present, and future that we relate to.

The Creedhas methodically progressed from the passageabove regarding the Gnostic and CatholicChurch – the material basis of the congregation –to the divine and separate self in each of us. My life corresponds to Tiphareth on theTree of Life, and to the censer in the Mass. “AUMGN, AUMGN, AUMGN.” Crowley transliterates aumgn to aFmgn,demonstrating again that numerology is of fargreater importance than phonetic spelling whenit comes to words of this nature. Rightfully so, forit is in the correspondences where we findmeaning in the word. Its value is 100,corresponding to the Greek lagneia (lust) –again the underlying principle of the union ofopposites. By pythmenes, the value is the same asthat of Air. This word is a Thelemic mantra. As such,it literally represents the aspiration of thecongregants, as they conspire to unite in breathand vibration, raising the spiritual consciousnessof each. It is also suggestive of our immanentoneness with God and the divinity of our selves.Our mantra corresponds to the three Supernalspheres on the Tree of Life (Binah, Chokhmah,and Kether), and the altar in the Mass. Thisconcludes the line-by-line analysis. Looking at our Creed as a whole, thereappears to be a correspondence to the Gloriasection of Crowley’s Star Sapphire ritual (seeThe Book of Lies). It may be appropriate toexamine and compare the Gnostic Mass to theStar Sapphire, as well as other eucharistic rites(such as the Mass of the Phoenix). Also, I havefound a kind of recursive expression of the hwhyformula within the Creed. The Creed depicts the act of creation, andthe aspiration of the created. It foreshadowsfuture repetition of this cycle, demonstrating byexample that there is no part of us that is not ofthe gods.

What is Magical Energy?he Gnostic Mass - like virtually allceremonial rituals - utilizes what is called“magical energy,” “magical force,” or“magical power.” This magical energy is amysterious force that operates under the controlof the Magician, the individual who consciouslyemploys it to effect his or her magical ends. Thenature of magical energy is obscure, and it isoften described in multiple, sometimescontradictory ways. We may begin to understandwhat magical force is, at least its theoreticalaspects, by understanding how Crowleyunderstood and used the term in various ways.TPranaMagical force is understood in one way as“prana,” the Hindu term for energy. Prana hasbeen called “energy,” the “life-force,” or the“vitalizing principle” of the universe, and it has itsparticular expression in the microcosm of Man.Prana as the life-force is therefore connected withthe idea of breath, or the “breath of life,” whichis a name for the vitalizing principle of Life invarious systems. For the Hindus it is prana, forthe Chinese it is chi, for the Japanese it is ki, andfor the Hebrew it is ruach: all these termsessentially equate “breath” and “spirit” or “life-force.” In this way, we may liken it to that whichis mentioned in the Creed of the Gnostic Mass,“I believe... in one Air the nourisher of all thatbreathes.” Sabazius reinforces this interpretationin his commentary to this line of the Creed, “Asthe Ruach, it is the Holy Spirit, the Mind of theFormative World, and the Son of the Father,which caresses the cheek of our fair Mother, andwhich descends from the sky to mediate betweenus and our Father the Sun by communicating theHoly Prana into our blood through Inspiration.”This connection between breath andprana, or magical force, is the rationale for thepractice of pranayama, which involves theregularization and control of the breath.Pranayama is not technically the control of pranadirectly, but it is the control of prana through thecontrol of breath, which is understood as aprimary vehicle of prana. Pranayama tends toproduce a certain kind of sweat which can beseen as a parallel to or identified with thatspoken of in The Book of the Law: “...the dew ofher light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling perfume of sweat.”143 This connectionwill be further developed in the next mainsection of this essay. AudThere is a particular tripartite division ofLight utilized in the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn, which uses three different termsto describe different “types” or “aspects” of force:Aub, Aud, and Aur. This Order and its tenetsobviously influenced Crowley’s thinking greatly. Aub is a kind of lunar force, associatedwith the terms “Obi” and “obeah,” and Crowleycalls it “the astral light... an illusory thing ofwitchcraft (cf. Obi, Obeah)... [which is] sluggish,143 Liber AL, I:27.The Journal of Thelemic Studies63The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"vicious”144 and “the secret Fire of Obeah.”145 This is contrasted with Aud, which iscalled “Special 'fire' or 'light' of the Sacred Magicof Light, Life, and Love; hence ‘Odic Force’”146and “Aud is almost = the Kundalini force (‘Odic’force)... [which is] “keen, ecstatic.”147 Aud isspecifically the form of Light or force that isunderstood as “magical force” - reinforced by thefact that Aud (AVD) enumerates to 11, thenumber of Magick; he also equates it with theKundalini force within Mankind (which we willcome back to in a moment). Aur is generally a term used for Light ingeneral and specifically refers to Divine Light - itis associated with “Ain Soph Aur,” the LimitlessLight that forms the 3rd Negative Veil ofExistence on the Qabalistic tree of Life. In theGolden Dawn system, which Crowleyundoubtedly picked up on and utilized, thePracticus 3°=8☐ ritual explains that Aub, Aud,and Aur are the threefold forms of Fire(understood here as another name for Light orforce). The Aub is the “Astral” and “Passive”form of Fire, Aud is the “Volcanic” and “Active”form of Fire, and Aur is the “Solar” and“Equilibrated” form of Fire. We might symbolizethese three forces in the microcosm as thepassive & undirected force in Man (Aub), theactive & directed force in Man (Aud), and theDivine or macrocosmic force that imposes uponMan in ecstasy and illumination (Aur). Within the context of magical ritual, andthe Gnostic Mass in particular, it can beunderstood that “magical force” is understood asAud, the active and directed form of force,directed by the intent of the Magician. This isconfirmed in Liber Aleph where Crowley writes144 Liber LVIII.145 Liber Aleph.146 Sepher Sephiroth.147 Liber LVIII: Gematria.of the symbol of the Lion, “Of this, Lion, o mySon, be it said that this is the Courage of thyManhood, leaping upon all Things, and seizingthem for their Prey... in The Book of Thoth He isthe Atu called Strength [or ‘Lust’ when he final;ycreated his Thoth Tarot], whose Number isELEVEN which is Aud, the Light Odic ofMagick. And therein is figured the Lion, evenTHE BEAST, and Our Lady BABALON astrideof Him, that with her Thighs She may strangleHim.” There is, of course, also the cryptic note atthe end of Crowley’s discussion of Atu XI: Lustin The Book of Thoth which reads, “Furtherstudy of this card may be made by closeexamination of Liber XV [i.e. The GnosticMass].” There is thus a direct connectionbetween Aud, 11, Atu XI: Lust, and the GnosticMass in particular. KundaliniKundalini is the “serpent power” withineach individual which lies dormant, coiled 3 ½times in the Muladhara chakra at the base of thespine. It represents the magical force of Manwhich is awakened and brought progressively upthe spine to the Ajna chakra in the forehead (the“third eye”) wherein it unites with the “Lord ofAll,” and the bliss of samadhi or ecstatic union ofsubject and object occurs. We have seen already that Crowleyequates the active, directed magical force of Audwith Kundalini. Further, the equation ofKundalini with prana is frequent in many texts,and their connection is often explained by thefact that Kundalini is the prana as manifested inthe microcosm of Man. Kundalini is an idea tiedup very closely with those of Shiva and Shakti, aswell as the cosmological notions that they imply.Very briefly, Shiva is the formless, inert,boundless and infinite Godhead that isUnmanifest, whereas Shakti (which literallymeans “power”) is the force and form, active,The Journal of Thelemic Studies64The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"boundless and infinite Godhead that is Manifest;they are always understood to be One, Shiva-Shakti, and their separation is only due toignorance. A Qabalistic analogy would be thatthe Negative Veils, or Naught, is Shiva, and anydeviation from that Naught would be Shakti,including the 1, the initial Positive manifestation;Crowley likens them to the Tao (Shiva) and theTeh (Shakti) in his Tao Teh Ching; in Thelemicontology, Shiva would be 0 and Shakti would be2 (or That which causes things to appear as 2).Certain sects of Hindus therefore believe that theentire universe is the Manifestation of Shakti,which is another way of saying the world is amanifestation of Power (Nietzsche was about amillenium behind the Hindus with that particularthought). Shakti is understood to be manifested inMan (meaning the human individual) as Shakti-Kundalini, the serpent-power aforementioned,and it is by her rising up the spine to unite withher Lord Shiva in the Ajna that enlightenment isattained. Therefore, Kundalini is understood asthe manifestation of Power (“Shakti”) or Life(prana) in the individual. Is Kundalini Male or Female?It is notable that this serpent-power ofmagical energy or force is explicitly identified asthe “feminine” Shakti, whereas it is common inWestern thought to associate power/activity withthe masculine and receptivity/passivity to thefeminine. A parallel is found, of course, inBabalon and the Scarlet Woman in whom “is allpower given”148 and who is “girt with a sword.”149The Priestess in the Gnostic Mass is identifiablewith Shakti-Kundalini, especially at certain points(although it should be said that both Priestessand Priest very clearly interact and identify withthis Serpent force at various times). To name the148 Liber AL, I:15.149 Liber AL, III:11.most obvious examples, the Priestesscircumambulates the Temple 3 ½ times beforedescending to the Tomb, reflecting the Kundaliniserpent that is coiled 3 ½ times at the base of thespine. The Priestess is literally girt with a sword,identifying her with the Scarlet Woman in whom“is all power [Shakti] given.” More subtly, thePriestess gives the sign of the descending trianglewhen placed upon the Summit of the Earth (theHigh Altar), which is the symbol of Ra-Hoor-Khuit but it is also the special symbol of Shakticalled the Trikona which appears depicted insideseveral chakras (centers of force infused byShakti-Kundalini) in the spine. There is also thefact that she is an ecstatic female figure thatappears above the Priest, just as Shakti isdepicted “riding” Shiva in sexual embrace whichis essentially the same in essence as Babalonriding the Beast in “Atu XI: Lust.” The Priest, too, is identified with “magicalforce” in various ways: he is crowned with aSerpent as a crown which reflects theillumination of the Yogi when the SerpentKundalini reaches the brow. In Liber AL, Haditidentifies himself with the Serpent in severalplaces, showing Hadit is manifested as magicalforce in the symbolic form of the Serpent. ThePriest identifies himself with Hadit on the secondstep toward the Veil. Further, the Priest carriesthe Lance which is symbolic of the Middle Pillarof the Tree of Life and all axis mundi figures(such as “the world-ash wonder tree” symbol ofYggdrasil utilized in the Anthem of the Mass): incertain Hindu texts that discuss Kundalini, thespine of the Yogi with its chakras is identifiedwith Mount Meru, a form of the “HolyMountain” axis mundi archetype that can also beseen in the symbols of Mount Zion of theHebrews, Mount Olympus of the Greeks, andMount Abiegnus of the Rosicrucians (to namebut a few). The Lance is therefore symbolic ofmanifested magical force, the KundaliniThe Journal of Thelemic Studies65The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"“extended”, which is reinforced by the fact thatthe Priest invokes Nuit “by seed, and root, andstem, and bud, and leaf, and flower, and fruit”which can be considered to be symbolicreflections of the 7 chakras depicted as variousforms of a Tree, of which the Lance is a symbol.Consider these things in relation to what Crowleyremarks in Magick:“The Serpent which is coiled about theCrown means many things, or, rather, onething in many ways. It is the symbol ofroyalty and of initiation, for the Magicianis anointed King and Priest [as the Priestin the Mass]. It also represents Hadit...The serpent is also the Kundalini serpent,the Magical force itself, the manifestingside of the Godhead of the Magician[Shakti], whose unmanifested side is peaceand silence [Shiva], of which there is nosymbol. In the Hindu system the GreatWork is represented by saying that thisserpent, which is normally coiled at thebase of the spine [Muladhara chakra],rises with her [Shakti’s] hood over thehead of the Yogi [reflected in the Priest’scap of maintenance], there to unite withthe Lord of all [Shiva].” 150The Redemptive ForceWe can therefore see an identity betweenthe Serpent, Kundalini, Hadit, and magical force.To these we may add the “Aud” of Magick andthe prana, at least as it is specifically manifestedin the individual. Further symbolism can beunderstood when Shakti or Kundalini isunderstood as the Redeemer: it is the forcewhich liberates the Yogi from the cycle of rebirthof samsara and the illusion of maya. In this way,it is - to use the Western equivalent - the Messiah,or one might say “the messianic force” or“redemptive force.” Crowley writes:150 Liber ABA, Part II, chapter 9.In Daath is said to be the Head of thegreat Serpent Nechesh or Leviathan,called Evil to conceal its Holiness.(NChSh [Serpent] = 358 = MShICh[Messiah], the Messiah or Redeemer, andLVYThN [Leviathan] = 496 = MLKVTh[Malkuth], the Bride. It is identical withthe Kundalini of the Hindu Philosophy,the Kwan-se-on of the Mongolian Peoples,and means the magical Force in Man,which is the sexual Force applied to theBrain, Heart, and other Organs, andredeemeth him.” 151 We therefore see an identity betweenKundalini, the magical Force in Man, theMessiah, and the Serpent Nechesh. Crowley alsoadds in this quotation that this is “the sexualForce.” In the Hindu understanding, the sexualforce is but one form - although perhaps the mostpowerful and volatile form - of Shakti orKundalini, as Shakti is “power” itself andrepresents all Force, both in the Macrocosm ofthe Universe and in the Microcosm of Man.Undoubtedly, this is also true in our system, butwe recognize the sexual Force as the most potentmanifestation of magical Force in general, and itshould be clear that the Gnostic Mass utilizes thissexual aspect of Kundalini, or magical force.Even in the Hindu system, Shakti is representedin sexual coition (called maithuna) with Shiva,signifying their ecstatic union. The parallel withthe Priest and Priestess is likely obvious to most.Two Additional PointsIn closing this brief exploration, there aretwo notes to make that may seem obvious tosome readers but are still worthwhile to pointout. Firstly, it is worth repeating that this magicalforce, or Kundalini or Aud or whatever name we151 Liber LVIII: Gematria.The Journal of Thelemic Studies66The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"wish to call it, is within both the Priest andPriestess. On the material plane, this means thatall individuals, regardless of their biological sex,possess Kundalini or magical force. According toHindu doctrine, if one did not have this force insome measure, one would be dead since it is thevivifying life-force itself. In our terminology,“Every man and every woman is a star,” and also“I believe... in one Air the nourisher of all thatbreathes.” If anything, this Kundalini is in all butexpresses itself in different ways, differentformulas of force for the different sexes: the wemight call these the “formulas” of the lingam andyoni, which are ritualistically depicted in theLance and Cup of the Priest and Priestess.152 Bothare necessary for the accomplishment of themagical goal of the Mass. As Crowley writes,“The soul is beyond male and female as it isbeyond Life and Death. Even as the Lingam andthe Yoni are but diverse developments of OneOrgan...”153 This parallels the notion that the“Phallus,” another term used often by Crowleywhich is equated with Kundalini and magicalpower, is actually bi-gendered and not solely theproperty of biological males. The Phallus isproperly understood not as the lingam, but as thelingam-yoni.154 We can therefore see that “thesole vice-rent of the Sun upon the Earth” is the152 It is notable that many Priests describe their experience ofthe Mass as a kind of contraction into a point, and manyPriestesses describe their experience as one of expansion,which reflect the magical Images of Hadit and Nuit,respectively, as in “In the sphere I am everywhere thecentre, as she, the circumference, is nowhere found... I amthe Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel,and the cube in the circle. ‘Come unto me’ is a foolish word:for it is I that go” (AL, II:7)153 The Book of Lies, chapter 35.154 This identity between the Phallus and Lingam-Yoni is seenthrough Greek isopsephy where the phrase “O PhALLE” (asin the Star Ruby) in Greek is equal to the value of the words“PhALLOS” (lingam) and “KTEIS” (yoni) added together.[ = 800+500+1+30+30+5 = 1366; =ΩΦΑΛΛΕΦΑΛΛΟΣ500+1+30+30+70+200 = 831; = 20+300+5+10+200 =ΚΤΕΙΣ535; therefore: 831+535 = 1366.]Generative power of “every man and everywoman,” reflected ritualistically into theinteractions between Priest (lingam) and Priestess(yoni). Secondly, it is worth nothing that,although this sexual aspect of magical force isutilized in the Mass, there is no sexual contact -let alone sexual intercourse - in the Mass itself.This implies that the symbolic enactment thereofcontains magical force in itself, and it is notsimply the physical acts of sexuality that areidentifiable with Kundalini, magical force, etc.Even in their symbolic depiction - for example,in the stroking of the Lance or its depression intothe Cup - they are not simply “blinds” forphysical sex; on the contrary, the acts of physicalsex are material manifestations of higherprinciples, the striving toward the union ofsubject and object in samadhi, the union ofShakti and Shiva in the fully risen Kundalini.Consider what Crowley says about the actual,physical act of sex and its ritualistic use in hisessay “Energized Enthusiasm,” let alone whatthat implies for symbolic or ritualistic depictionsof sex: “In the sacramental and ceremonial use ofthe sexual act, the divine consciousnessmay be attained... Admit [sex’s] religiousfunction, and one may at once lay downthat the act must not be profaned. It mustnot be undertaken lightly and foolishlywithout excuse... I need hardly emphasizethe necessity for the strictest self-controland concentration on their part. As itwould be blasphemy to enjoy the grosstaste of the wine of the sacrament, so mustthe celebrant suppress even the minutestmanifestation of animal pleasure... thesexual excitement must be suppressedand transformed into its religiousequivalent... It is, indeed, of the firstThe Journal of Thelemic Studies67The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"importance for the celebrant in anyphallic rite to be able to complete the actwithout even once allowing a sexual orsensual thought to invade his mind.” 155One might say this all really reduces to,and all naturally follows from the simple andsublime injunction, “Be not animal; refine thyrapture!”156 SummaryThe essential point, to summarize ourvarious tangents, is that sexuality and the sexualforce are form of magical force (or Kundalini)and possibly its most powerful form thereof;magical force is, after all, equated with the life-force and sex is the act by which life perpetuatesitself. Nonetheless, the sexual force must beconscious, controlled, and directed for it to beproperly considered “magical force.” This will befurther explored in the next main section of thisessay. The Gnostic Mass is a sacred rite whereinthis magical force as manifested in sexuality isutilized ritualistically to accomplishment itsmagical ends. What is it really, though?The preceding discussion of magical forceor energy was to show that this idea has manynames and has appeared in many systems. It isprana, chi, ki, ruach, and kundalini; it is calledvariously “magical energy,” “magical force,” or“magical power”; it is often identified with thesexual force or seen as manifested particularlystrongly in sexuality. Nonetheless, what ismagical force really? Crowley discusses this briefly in Magick inTheory & Practice where he writes, “Prana or‘force’ is often used as a generic term for allkinds of subtle energy...There is some ground forthe belief that there is a definite substance (This155 Liber DCCXI: Energized Enthusiasm.156 Liber AL, III:70.substance need not be conceived as ‘material’ inthe crude sense of Victorian science...)”157 It isconceived as a subtle energy that may not be“material” - that is, it does not operate on matterin the way that gravity or electromagnetism do.Around the turn of the 20th century, it waspopular for magical force in general to beexplained by a sort of “aether”, often identifiedwith the now-discarded scientific theory of theluminiferous aether, wherein travels “magicalforce” or “astral light” or whatever similarterminology. Since the aether is not an empiricalconstruct, this explanation can only remain akind of quaint metaphor for whatever-it-is that isreally going on - it is retained in the Gnostic Massitself in the line “Let this offering be borne uponthe waves of Aethyr...” If magical force or pranais an objective force in some way, even if “non-material” in some sense, then it won’t be able tobe measured with typical measurement toolswhich, of course, measure material things. This also relates to the tendency toattribute the chakras to various physiologicalcorrelates such as nerve plexuses: aside fromthese facts being constantly skewed by authors sothat they fit their theories, there is no cleancorrelation of chakras to nerve plexuses in thebody, and the Hindus themselves insist that thechakras and the Kundalini that may invigoratethem are a form of “subtle”, i.e. not material,force. They are, in the end, misguided attemptsto validate a spiritual experience and practice bytrying to show how it supposedly fits into thecurrent materialistic paradigm of science. On thisfront of seeing prana and/or chakras as materialin some way, we must hold our tongues, at leastuntil there is some way to possibly measure sucha force that has essentially eluded scientists to thisday. There is another possible approach, which157 Magick in Theory & Practice, chapter 12.The Journal of Thelemic Studies68The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"is that the notion of “energy” springs from asubjective, first-hand experience of some kind.This first-hand experience might be called a“phenomenological fact” in the same way thatone experiences pain, sadness, or excitement andno knowledge of any physiology is required tojustify the fact that pain, sadness, or excitementare felt as real. That is to say: people have anexperience of feeling something like “energy” or“magical force” moving within their own mindsand bodies, and this has been given the nameprana, chi, kundalini, etc. The very fact that an almost identicalphenomenon has been described and has namesin various languages attests that this - at least theexperience of energy in some form - is basicallyuniversal across cultures. In a sense, this is whatis important to ritual and magick in general as itis the first-hand, direct experience of theindividual which counts. If the experience of thePriest, for example, is that certain words,movements, and thoughts lead to an experienceof magical energy and its manipulation toexperience certain things, such as the“movement” of energy or its culmination inecstasy, then it does not matter at all whether thismagical force is material, non-material,subjective, objective, or anything else. InCrowley’s words from Liber O, “It is immaterialwhether these exist or not. By doing certainthings certain results will follow; students aremost earnestly warned against attributingobjective reality or philosophic validity to any ofthem.” Therefore, we may most beneficially takea pragmatic stance on magical force - not wishingto stake a claim on some quite-possibly falsenotion of this magical force as material andempirically verifiable - as the first-handexperience of this “force” or “energy” and itsvarious results when directed are what matter(pun not intended). II. What does Magical Energy feel like?Celebrants of the Mass often speak of“moving energy” or “feeling the energy” (or thelack thereof). While there is absolutely nomention thereof in the actual rubric of theGnostic Mass158, it is not surprising thatMagicians - familiar with other forms ofceremonial magick in theory & practice - will seevarious opportunities for “energy work” in the158 It may be that something amounting to this might beintended by the note in the rubric, “Certain secret formulæof this Mass are taught to the PRIEST in his Ordination”;unfortunately it seems we will never know what was meantby that phrase. Sabazius notes, “Some commentators havealleged that these Certain Secret Formulae are none otherthan the secrets of the Ninth Degree O.T.O. Obviously, thiscannot be the case if the Priest being ordained is not aninitiate of the Ninth Degree of O.T.O. However, certainsecret formulae of this Mass are set forth in certain of theessays herein,” by which he presumably means theTetragrammaton (YHVH) and Pentagrammaton (YHShVH)as they are the two formulae to which he refers often.ritual. The experience of “energy” itself is goingto be unique to each individual, just as any oneperson’s experience of anything will be differentfrom another’s. Nonetheless, there are somecommon threads that seem to at least besomewhat universal. What appears to be the most universalfirst-hand sense of energy is a sense of heat. Thisis unsurprising as there are parallels in othertraditions; the most obvious is the Hindu notionof tapas which refers to spiritual austerities(including mantra, concentration, etc.). The termtapas literally means “heat” and it is by thevarious spiritual practices that a yogi generatesthe “spiritual heat” of aspiration. This isparalleled in a Holy Book of Thelema where asimilar idea is spoken to using alchemicalThe Journal of Thelemic Studies69The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"imagery: “...in the alembic of this spiritualalchemy, if only the zelator blow sufficientlyupon his furnace all the systems of earth areconsumed in the One Knowledge.”159 Aside from the symbolic notion of“spiritual heat,” energy is felt as a literal heat inthe body, and can even lead to a certain type ofsweat. This is spoken of in the context ofpracticing pranayama (which we earlier saw isessentially the practice of controlling “magicalenergy” through manipulation of the breath),where Crowley writes, “If Pranayama beproperly performed, the body will first of allbecome covered with sweat. This sweat isdifferent in character from that customarilyinduced by exertion. If the Practitioner rub thissweat thoroughly into his body, he will greatlystrengthen it.”160 This sweat is mentioned in Liber AL andechoed in the Gnostic Mass itself when the Priestsays “...the dew of her light bathing his wholebody in a sweet-smelling perfume of sweat.”161Notably, at this point, the entire Congregationalong with the Deacon and Children are all in apose of adoration on their knees with their handsraised above their hands like little flames ofillumination, the tapas or “spiritual heat” bywhich the Priest’s aspiration is led to the Veil torend it. In practice, one might feel one’s bodyfilled with heat, one’s face might become flushed,one’s arms and legs might seem to be particularlywarm, and it seems to be particularlypronounced if one is focusing attention upon aparticular point of the body (e.g. the area of thebreast or heart might become especially warm iffocusing thereon). Energy is also experienced in other ways.The most common other than a sense of heat -159 Liber Porta Lucis.160 Liber RV vel Spiritus.161 Liber AL, I:27.although often connected thereto - is the feelingof “chills” or one’s hair “standing on end.”Another is a feeling of lightheaded-ness, similarto when one’s body is overheated from exertion,although this sense in particular may indicate thatone’s “vessel” is not strong enough to contain the“energy.” As it is said in Liber AL, II:70,“Wisdom says: be strong! Then canst thou bearmore joy.”Heat, chills, and lightheadedness are allparticularly sensory or visceral experiencesconnected with the experience of energy. Thereare also more “perceptual” changes such as thecontraction of focus or expansion of awareness,often occurring in Priest or Priestess respectively.There are, no doubt, other ways in which energymight be felt – it may be felt as a sharp shock, anelectric impulse, a diffuse warmth, or reallyanything else: there is no reason to exclude apriori any particular manifestations of magicalenergy. The only way one can be certain howthey are going to experience it is to simply bemindful while engaging in ritual in order tobecome aware of changes in sensation andperception that might accompany this “moving ofenergy.” “Tantric Feast” (circa 1790); India, Nurpur.The Journal of Thelemic Studies70The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"III. How do we use Magical Energy? We have treated the theoretical andexperiential sides of “magical energy” or“magical power,” yet the practical questionremains: how might the Magician generate andemploy this energy to their ritualistic endsPranayamaAs to the generation of magical energy,one method has been mentioned repeatedly thusfar: pranayama. This includes the formal practiceof pranayama wherein one sits in a determinedposture, or asana, and breaths for very specificcounts of exhalation, inhalation, and retention fora specific amount of time. Nonetheless, we mightinclude any method that intentionally alters thebreathing pattern under the heading ofpranayama. The use of breath in the Mass issomething that is not written into the rubric itself,but many traditions have been passed downthrough word of mouth. It is an important meansof accessing “magical energy” in the celebrationof the Mass, and further details as to how thevarious Officers of the Mass might employ breathwill be treated in the next section of this essay. VisualizationVisualization is another primary vehicle ofgenerating magical energy. The visualization ofvarious things – including Light, energy, symbols,and so on – can be used to generate magicalenergy. For example, during the lifting of theLance, the Priest might visualize the shaft of theLance as being imbued with electric energywhich is emitted in a great Light from the tip ofthe Lance; or: during the consecration of theHost, the Priest might visualize energydescending from the Lance into the Host tomake it the Body of God. Regardless of thecontent of visualization, the act of visualizing isanother source of magical energy for thecelebrants of the Mass. InvocationThe generation of magical energy is alsodone in anything that is an invocation of anytype. Along with the more explicit invocationssuch as the “Thou who art I...” of the Anthem,there are more subtle invocations such as thecircumambulations of the Temple by variousOfficers, the use of Words of Powers (AUMGNand IAO are the most frequent in the Mass), andcertain gestures (the Cross, or “the Sign of Light”,is the most frequently used invocatory gesture aswell as the stroking of the Lance, various touchesand kisses, etc.)SexualityA special “type” or “class” of invocationwould be those of a sexual nature. We havealready seen the intimate link between the notionof magical energy and sexual force, and theGnostic Mass definitely utilizes at least thesymbolic enactment of sexuality to effect its ends.Therefore, the parts of the Mass that areparticularly “sexual” in nature can be seen asspecifically focused on the generation ordischarge of magical power through the vehicleof sexual expression. The stroking of the Lanceeleven times, the raising of the Lance, thepiercing of the Veil by the Lance, the nakednessof the Priestess and the Priest’s the adorationthereof during the Collects, and the identificationof the particle of the Host with the Priest’s spermare all fairly explicit examples of the wedding ofsexual force to the invocation of magical energyin the Mass. The simultaneous orgasm of“HRILIU” from both Priest and Priestessdepressing the Lance into the Cup is an explicitexample of the discharge of magical energythrough sexual symbolism. The Journal of Thelemic Studies71The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Regardless of details, the sexual nature ofthe Mass has the potential to generate sexualenergy - to generate desire, passion, magnetism,and similarly sexually-charged sensations - thatcan be consciously controlled and directed asmagical force proper.ConcentrationUltimately, all of these various techniquesfor the generation of magical energy must comeunder the general technique of concentration, orfocused attention. It is the concentration of theMagician that gives magical power its purpose,control, and direction. It is the differencebetween simply lighting a fire and lighting a fireto be used for cooking food, between dischargingelectricity and the directed use of electricity topower something. It is stated unambiguously in LiberLibrae: “To obtain Magical Power, learn tocontrol thought; admit only those ideas that arein harmony with the end desired, and not everystray and contradictory Idea that presents itself.”The prerequisite to the channeling of magicalenergy or power in the Mass (or in any ritual) istherefore the ability to concentrate the mind, tocontrol thought, to limit focus to the task at handwithout distraction. There is an unknown andpossibly infinite degree to which one might honeone’s concentration skills, so it is unreasonable toexpect someone to be an “expert” beforeattempting to “move energy” in the Mass orother rituals. Nonetheless, a general foundationof skill in concentration is the necessary basis forthe successful generation and direction ofmagical energy. This is the reason for Crowley’swarning:“The Magician may easily beoverwhelmed and obsessed by the forcewhich he has let loose; it will thenprobably manifest itself in its lowest andmost objectionable form. The mostintense spirituality of purpose is absolutelyessential to safety (This is a matter ofconcentration, with no ethical implication.The danger is that one may get somethingwhich one does not want. This is ’bad’ bydefinition. Nothing is in itself good orevil.)” 162 This concentration one thing - or “intensespirituality of purpose” - becomes especiallyimportant when utilizing forces such as sexuality,for which our conditioned habit is to descendinto pure animalistic indulgence rather than thetransmutation thereof to effect magical ends. It should be noted, in concluding thissection, that there are doubtless plenty of othermeans to generate magical energy. The list is notintended to be exhaustive, but the most commonand obvious cases have been noted above. SummaryWe have seen that magical energy isgenerated through work with the breath(pranayama), visualization, invocation, andsexuality. We have also seen that magical energyis directed through the power of concentration orfocus of attention. Anyone who wanted tobecome more proficient and utilizing magicalenergy in the Mass, or in any ritual, would dowell to engage in exercises that strengthen thecore faculties of breath control, visualization, andconcentration163, and a general familiarity withone’s own ability to “enflame oneself in prayer”through invocation, sexual or otherwise, isobviously beneficial as well. For the moreadvanced student, the study of certain HolyBooks is recommended to supplement one’sunderstanding, especially Liber A’ash velCapricorni Pneumatici, Liber Stellae Rubeae,and portions of Liber AL. 162 Magick in Theory & Practice, chapter 12.163 Liber E gives practices for pranayama and concentration.The Journal of Thelemic Studies72The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"IV. How might the Officers employ Magical Energy in the Mass?We now have a basic skeleton ofunderstanding of magical energy, both in theory& practice. We have seen that magical energy -also known as “magical force” and “magicalpower” - was known under various names suchas the life-force, prana, Aud, kundalini, andPhallus; that it resides in both men and women;and that ultimately we may not (or may never)know of its true nature, but we may work with itin a pragmatic way where certain results occurfrom certain actions. We have seen that magicalenergy is typically felt as heat, chills, light-headed-ness, and the expansion / contraction ofawareness. Practically, we have seen that magicalenergy can be generated through breath,visualization, invocation, and sexuality and it ischanneled through concentration. All of theseideas form the building blocks from which wemay construct an understanding of how we mightgo about generating and directing magicalenergy in the Mass. This discussion will not be exhaustive asthere are as many ways to work with energy inthe Mass as there are individuals (or, perhaps, asmany as there are different permutations ofdifferent “Mass teams”). These are merelysuggestive, to give directions of inquiry andexperiment for each individual to experiment. Ifthere is one universal piece of advice I mightoffer, it is that - regardless of whatever it is one isdoing - there should be a reason for doing it.There should be an intention guiding the actions,and the only way to truly “do it wrong” is togenerate and direct energy without any particularaim or rationale. It is the fact that energy iscontrolled and directed that makes it the powerof a Magician, one who causes Change inconformity with Will, rather than simply anyperson off the street. ChildrenThe Children of the Mass have nospeaking roles within the ritual, which leads tomany feeling like participating in the role ofChild is not much more than acting as “Templefurniture.” First of all, the lack of speaking rolesgives the Children the opportunity to focusexclusively - at least at first - on proper posture(remaining in the Attitude of Resurrection forlong periods is definitely it’s own asana practice!),moving in a mirrored fashion with one another,and learning to adapt to the unexpected whichinevitably occurs. These things are all worthwhilepractices in themselves and the skills theystrengthen will undoubtedly aid the individual intheir eventual celebration as Deacon and/or asPriest/Priestess. On top of this, the role of Child is aperfect place to start to begin to experiment andwork with magical energy. We can, in fact, seethe role of Children as being that of the Priestand Priestess but “on a lower octave,” just likethe Prince and Princess of Tetragrammaton maygrow to become the King and Queen. The“Positive Child” and “Negative Child” can thenwork with energy between themselves as do thePriest and Priestess with each other. It might benoted that the “energy flow” of the Priest andPriestess is almost entirely “vertical” if weimagine looking down on the Gnostic Masstemple with the High Altar at the top(corresponding to the Supernals of the Tree ofLife). The Children’s “energy flow” betweeneach other is then almost entirely “horizontal,”balancing out that of the Priest and Priestess.Whatever the Children decide to do interms of working with magical energy, theyshould decide together before the Mass begins.Regardless of what specific work is being done, itThe Journal of Thelemic Studies73The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"should ideally be paralleled or mirrored by theother Child for the sake of symbolic and magicalequilibrium within the Temple. What follows areseveral examples of what the Children might doif they were to attempt to work with magicalenergy. This is obviously not official in any way:the examples are meant to be purely suggestive,to help Children to figure out something theymight experiment with in order that they mightfind what works best for them.Firstly, the Children may focus on theirbreath. The breath should be made deeper andlonger, although I firmly caution against strainingand/or jerkiness with breathing. This intentionalbreathing alone is a worthwhile practice, andmight be profitably experimented with forseveral Masses without any other additions. One might add the visualization ofimagining that, when inhaling, one is drawing inthe breath of the other Child and, whenexhaling, one is “feeding” the other Child withone’s own breath. This “cycle” of energy is, ingeneral, a typical pattern of energy work as itrepresents a dynamic equilibrium, and thefoundation of all Magick is equilibrium. Further,the “cycling” can act as a sort of motor orfeedback loop, where the continuous cycling ofenergy has the effect of feeling that the energy isgetting stronger, warmer, more intense, andsimilar sensations. This general principle can beextended to virtually any energy work betweentwo individuals, including but not limited to thePriest and Priestess. One might add other visualizations on topof the breathing and cycling. For example, I haveheard of the Negative Child visualizing that theyinhale the breath from the Positive Child(cycling), but the exhale is visualized as awaterfall that rushes as a river over to the PositiveChild. The Positive Child then visualizes inhalingthis “river,” bringing up the energy through thebody, and exhaling it like a volcano expellingfire into the atmosphere. The fire and air travelsover to the Negative Child who inhales it, etcetera. Another example I have heard has beenthe Negative Child visualizing a typical Watertriangle (apex downward) between the twoChildren, while the Positive Child visualizes atypical Fire triangle (apex upward); together,their visualizations form the Hexagram of unionin the middle. My personal preference is tosimply focus upon breath and the simplevisualization of cycling breath, but it may beadvantageous to certain individuals to have morecomplex visualizations, even if only to practicethe faculty of visualization while Child-ing. Communion is a time that is ripe forenergy work, aside from the rest of the Masswhere the Children are virtually always facingeach other and can be practicing cycling breathor other forms of energy work. The Childrencan, of course, continue their energy cyclingbetween one another. I personally prefer to focusmy attention on the Communicants as they comeup, since - at this point in the ritual - they are thecentral focus. There are nearly infinite options ofwhat to do at this point, but here are someexamples. One might cycle breath with the otherChild in between Communicants coming up tothe High Altar, and then focus one’s energyupon the Communicant, directing energy to theirhearts, their Solar center. One might also channel the energy intothe Cake of Light and goblet of Wine that theCommunicant receives, infusing it with evenmore magical energy. Since the offerings are ofLife (Cake of Light) and Joy (Wine), the PositiveChild can mentally say “I am Life and the giverof Life” while focusing on the Cake of Light theCommunicant is retrieving and consuming. TheNegative Child might mentally say “RememberThe Journal of Thelemic Studies74The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"all ye that existence is pure joy” while focusingon the Wine the Communicant is retrieving andconsuming. One might even completely stop “energywork” during Communication and simply giveone’s focused attention to the Communicant asthey partake of the Eucharist. All of these, again,are simply suggestions to get one’s own thoughtsgoing as to how one might use magical energy inthe Mass as a Child.DeaconThe Deacon also has many opportunitiesto work with magical energy during the GnosticMass. It has been noted, though, that the work ofthe Deacon is actually unlike the Children or thePriest and Priestess in a specific way, which isthat the Deacon must keep what Tau Polyphiluscalled “surface presence.”164 The Deacon cannotsimply get lost in the energy like Children or likethe Priest and Priestess tend to do, because he isresponsible for the People and the Temple ingeneral. He is, in this way, the “magician” of theMass - or even the “ego” of the Mass - which hasto make sure that the candles are all lit, there areenough wines for Communion, that disruptivepeople are dealt with accordingly, that someonehaving a coughing fit gets some water, or dealwith the infinite other things that can (and haveand will) go awry during a Mass. Nonetheless, there are still many times towork with magical energy as Deacon. Thefollowing list is, once again, simply suggestiveinstead of comprehensive. The Deacon beginswith the “magical weapon” of The Book of theLaw. The Deacon can imagine holding the Wordof God, or Logos, in their hands as theyapproach the High Altar with reverence. Afterbowing, the Deacon can take a deep breath andinfuse the Book with energy through their three164 See “Advice for Deacons” by Tau Polyphilus.kisses. Upon placing the Book on the super-altar,the Deacon may turn and project out this Logosthrough their pronouncement to theCongregation. During the recitation of the Creed,the Deacon can visualize the entire Templeforming like a new Universe, and the words ofthe Creed filling the Universe with its variouslaws and energy and motion. When handed thePriest's Lance, the Deacon can visualize that theyare holding a super-charged Promethean rod ofdivine Phallic energy. During the Saints Collect,the Deacon can visualize the crosses being tracedon the Cup which holds the blood of the saints,or upon the back of the Priest as a successor andheir of the Saints. As a side note, one shouldalways check with others if one is going to dovisualizations such as this – the Deacon mightsimply ask if it would be alright to draw thecrosses on the Priest's back during the Saints orwhether they have any preference themselves.There are, of course, many other opportunitiesfor the Deacon to utilize magical energy duringthe Mass, but I will leave them up to the reader'sown ingenium and experience to find thosewhich most authentically express their ownmagical ideals.Priest & PriestessThe Priest and Priestess are naturally theOfficers of the Gnostic Mass that most obviouslywork with magical energy. Every step the Priestor Priestess takes, every word they speak, everygesture they make are all infused with thepotentiality of great magical power. There areinnumerable ways the Priest and Priestess canmake use of magical energy in the Mass – far toonumerous to even begin to mention the manypossibilities. I will note that “breath work”between the Priest and Priestess is likely the bestfoundation for “moving” the energy of the Mass.There are several points where this is particularlynatural and efficacious:The Journal of Thelemic Studies75The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"1)When the Priestess kneels to stroke theLance eleven times, this gives anopportunity for the Priest and Priestess tobreathe in harmony with one another andwith the stroking of the Lance.2)During the Collects, when the Priest isadoring the Priestess on his knees, there isample opportunity for working withbreath and energy. This is an especiallygood time to “turn up” the energy, asthere are no words or actions for eitherPriest or Priestess to worry about duringthis period.3)During the commixto of Particle andWine, there can be a moment ofconjoined breath-work between the Priestand Priestess before the “HRILIU.”It might be added that the Priest“breathing with” the Priestess can mean manythings. The two simplest meanings of this are (a)inhaling & exhaling at the same time as oneanother, or (b) inhaling while the other exhalesand vice versa. My personal preference is thelatter, as it reflects a cyclic motion of breath andenergy similar to that recommended previouslyfor the Children. What works best must, asalways, be a result of one's own personalexperimentation and experience as well as thecollaboration with what one's Priest/Priestess iscomfortable with. V. ConclusionIn concluding this article, I wish to onceagain firmly impress upon the mind of the readerthat this essay is not meant to include all aspectsof “magical energy,” either in theory or inpractice. An entire book could (and should!) bewritten on such things. This essay's intention is simply to bringthe awareness of individuals to the deeperaspects of our work in the central rite of our HolyOrder. Nothing I have said is absolute, nor is itmeant to be. The various suggestions for energywork are just that: suggestions. I believe in “TheMethod of Science,” so I heartily encourage youto experiment with various approaches and seewhat works for yourself. As a final reminder, I believe we mustalways remember that all these discussions, allthese ideas, all these experiments, and exercisesare all (ideally) in order to deepen ourexperience of the Gnostic Mass, to furtherappreciate its manifold Mysteries, to bring theFlame of Knowledge more brilliantly tohumankind, and to more joyously andbeautifully engage in our True Wills. There is an amazing repository ofpotential in this beautiful ritual that is simplylying fallow, waiting for the injection of sincereaspirants' earnest intention and zeal.

II am an English major at San FranciscoState, and with that caveat, I will venture toexplain that I am viewing the insights that I havehad as Priestess as particularly phenomenalbecause it seems as though I have been granted,through the performance of the role, a practicallyconcrete experience of a slice of Crowley's \"Nuit\"metaphor. In many places, Crowley presents Nuit asrepresenting “the company of heaven,”165 and“Infinite Space, and the Infinite Stars thereof,”166which leads us towards another, equallyexpansive metaphor of stars as individuals. It hasbeen written in varying degrees of metaphor(something is) and simile (something is like):“every man and every woman is a star,”167 “for ineach Man his Inmost Light is the Core of his165 Liber AL, I:2.166 Liber AL, I:22.167 Liber AL, I:3.Star,”168 and “let each pursue his Will as a strongman that rejoiceth in his way, as the course of aStar that blazeth for ever among the joyouscompany of Heaven.”169 The list is notexhaustive, and I invite you to find more placesin the corpus where he draws up this connectionbetween Man and Star. So what does this mean for the Priestesson the altar? On the first step of the dais, thePriest's first utterance can be interpreted as anaddress to her, saying “O circle of stars.” When Iheard this line with the implications of themetaphor of “Star” carrying a meaning for“Individual,” it was further qualified by the shape“circle” – as it also happens to be the shapemade by the individual congregants of the Mass– I could not help but to identify – personallyidentify – as that circle of people in the room. This further catapults us deeper into ourpoet-Prophet's metaphorical representation of theworld around, and within, us. Think of all theplaces you've read or heard in Crowley's workswhere he uses the human body as a symbolicrepresentation of a community, society, ororganization of individuals. In his Eight Lectureson Yoga, he ventures to explain the deepernature of Yoga and Union, etc, but also takes thetime to illustrate how every cell in a complex168 Liber Aleph, Preface.169 Liber XV, “The Principles” in the Collects.The Journal of Thelemic Studies79The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"organism (like our own bodies) fulfills itspurposed function toward the achievement of“the general welfare” of the greater whole.170 Hesuccinctly says that, “We are communities,”meaning that our bodies are composed ofinterdependent units or cells. Think about thatfor a moment. It seems easy enough tointellectually comprehend, but this is exactlywhat I'm attempting to convey in this shortwriting. As a Priestess on the altar, with my ownpersonal set of cells fully exposed andvulnerable, I truly felt that I was that community,that group of Stars sitting circularly in thecongregation, celebrating together, as one. As you can imagine, a state ofconsciousness that involves moments ofidentification with a unit or group beyond one'sown personal self can be very disconnecting,almost like an unhinging sense of disassociation.In Liber Aleph, this gets explained deeper, andagain, in metaphor. In a chapter called “TheQabalistic Key to this Art,” Crowley speaks tothe nature of the Scarlet Woman: “I, being theLogos appointed thereunto, did create an Imageof my Little Universe in the Mind of the Womanof Scarlet; that is, I manifested mine wholeMagical Self in her Mind. Thus then in Her, as ina Mirror, have I been able to interpret myself tomyself.”171 This message is being given from theperspective of the Magician or, perhaps, thePriest in the Gnostic Mass equation, but thenature of the Priestess' experience is alsorevealed in his description. She becomes usefulto him when she behaves as a reflective170 Eight Lectures on Yoga, Yoga for Yahoos, First Lecture.171 Liber Aleph, chapter 84.instrument in the magical environment. As I saton the altar, identifying myself as that “circle ofstars” in the room, I did have a sense of beingobjectified, and not in the pejorative way. Aseach communicant stood before me, I thought, “Iam an image of you,” with “you” floating faintlyin the space between the plural and the singular.He writes again of this same idea in anothernamed “On the Formula of the Moon,” sayingthat, “The Nature of the Yin is to be still, and toencircle or limit, and it is as a Mirror, reflectingdiverse Images without Change in its ownkind.”172 A mirror is an object, and an objectiveone, as well. It is “still”, like the Priestess, and itserves to “encircle or limit,” as I feel the Priestessdoes for the community of congregants, as agroup and as individuals. As you can see, the nuances of myexperience of Priestess reflect a deeper value ofmine, and that is one of community. Myrelationship and function towards the Priest is, atthis point in my EGC career, vague at best. Ifanything, I conceptualize him as far as his firstadmittance allows: as “a man among men,” or inother words, a member of the community ofcongregants who has been selected from themall, to represent and to serve them all (as doesthe Priestess herself, although in a different, morepluralistic way) through the ceremony of theGnostic Mass. I hope, too, that this writing will helpexpand the experiences we have as congregants.If, in our chairs on the “sidelines,” we canvisualize, appreciate and potentially identifyourselves as the Priest and Priestess during a172 Liber Aleph, chapter 91.The Journal of Thelemic Studies80The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"celebration of the Mass, then how wonderful itwill be to expand that common phrase“participatory ritual” to new heights! Instead ofappreciating a Priestess as an individual fulfillinga role, how marvelous would it be to appreciateher as an image of me, and of us, and appreciateher as an individual who has sacrificed hersubjective self, so that she may exercise her“Formula of Force” to encircle or limit us, and,like a Mirror, reflect us back to ourselves.Through her, we are afforded the gloriousopportunity to interpret ourselves to ourselves,both as individuals and as a whole community.When we say, “There is no part of me that is notof the gods,” affirming the divinity withinourselves as individuals, I invite us all to hear,too, the reverberating echo of that line as givenfrom the perspective of the Priestess, as far as sherepresents us all in the congregation: There is nopart of her, meaning us, that is not of the gods.That is to say, there is no one individual in ourgroup who is not of these selfsame gods. As wedistinguish ourselves from the group,approaching the altar to partake of the Eucharist,and to declare ourselves divine, we do not stepoutside of the group, but rather allow ourselvesto be encircled by it.

We astonished ourselves asmuch as everyone else around us with ourmusicianship, and ever since that day, I wantedto harness it again for something extraordinary.WThat extraordinary day came in August2011 as I trembled nervously at my keyboard inthe center of a dynamic group of musicians, notknowing what my piece would inspire in thebiggest room of Thelemites I’d ever seen. Itwould either be total success or total failure; Icouldn’t sense a middle ground anywhere. In theChristian Church, most every kind of music hasbeen tried and judged for appropriateness atevery level since the Middle Ages, and there isno shortage of discussion and professionalopinion in the matter. However, in EGC there isa lot less talk and debate, partly because of thelaw of “Do what thou wilt,” but also because, sofar as I knew in 2011, no original piece of ink-and-paper choral music with the scope andbreadth of the Gnostic Mass had ever beenattempted.But discussions around music in theGnostic Mass will likely get more common themore we embrace the possibilities of music inthis ritual and how it can benefit us. When ouresteemed Priestess at NOTOCON 2011 sharedwith me how much the music of the GnosticMass moved her and everyone who was therelistening, I knew that this journey was just gettingstarted, and it was going to be wide open toanyone who dared to take it. The Problem of Music in Liber XVThe challenge with using music in theGnostic Mass is Crowley’s scanty directions inLiber XV. Consider the six areas of the Masswhere music is obligatory, and at these points noindication is given that it is optional or voluntary:1.“AUMGN. AUMGN. AUMGN. Music isnow played. The child enters with theewer and the salt.”2.“He then kneels and worships the Lancewith both hands. Penitential music.”3.“He raises the Lance. All repeat HailingSign. A phrase of triumphant music.”4.“He...shows Host to the PEOPLE holdingthe Paten beneath it, turns, replaces Patenand Host, and adores. Music.”5.“He...shows the Cup to the PEOPLE,turns replaces the Cup, and adores.Music.”The Journal of Thelemic Studies82The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"6.“He uncovers the Cup, genuflects, rises.Music.”Very little is said about how this music isto be played, and for how long and with what.For the entry of the Priestess and the Children,for instance, should the music be heard as thePriestess says, “Greeting of earth and heaven”?Should it accompany her serpentine walk all theway to the tomb? And what is the impetus forhaving music at that particular point? Similarquestions arise for the rest of the Mass,particularly the last three points, where the onlydirection given is simply, “Music,” and nothing atall is said about its duration or characteristics.Congregations the world over havedifferent solutions to these questions. One issimply to not have any music at all and avoidconfusion altogether. Another is to haverecorded music – either one long recording to beplayed throughout the ritual, or a series of clipsto highlight the obligatory points. It’s possible tohear recordings from all over the New Agespectrum and beyond, from electronica to chant,tribal drumming to Dead Can Dance, and stillmore.Still another possibility for music duringthe Mass is to have live musicians, but then thequestions arise: What instruments? Can there besinging? If so, on what text? Many of us wouldbe comfortable with launching a drum circle orchant, or employing our resident rock artists tocontribute, because anything remotely “churchy”or ecclesiastical would run counter to the impulseof the New Aeon.Or would it? Think back to what hadCrowley compose Liber XV in the particularway that he did: he intended it to correspond tothe liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church. Infact, it is a correction of that liturgy; itacknowledges that the Roman and Orthodoxrites have their real origins in a more mysticaltradition that predates Christianity – the cults ofOsiris, Mithras and Dionysus, to name a few –and the Gnostic Mass simply clarifies this. So itwould not be out of the question to have organs,angelic choirs, brass ensembles, string quartets,or any number of musical resources that havebeen characteristic of Christian churches for athousand years, so that we may set them squarelyin the New Aeon and let people know what allthat pomp and grandeur was really about.The Framework for the Gnostic MassNot long after I decided to composemusic for the Mass, I was handed a musicalsetting of the Anthem by Fr. H.K. 1131 that hadbeen used with some success in several differentcongregations, and our Grand Master and hisPriestess advised me that they wanted it sung atthe upcoming NOTOCON. Since the two ofthem specifically wanted this Anthem setting attheir Mass, it seemed natural to draw inspirationfrom it for the six other obligatory points inLiber XV that call for music. The end resultwould be a multi-movement sacred work with Fr.H.K. 1131’s anthem as the central feature. In away, it’s exactly like the Masses and sacredcantatas of traditional Catholic and ProtestantChurches that take a singular element—whetherit’s a folk melody, sacred chant, or bit ofscripture—and spin it out into a complex piecethat could easily be a musical concert unto itself.So the obligatory points for this Gnostic Masssetting would be like rays from the central Sun ofthe Anthem, projecting its harmonic and melodicelements in different directions. I would set it fora trio of female voices and organ, with a unisonchoir, drums and finger cymbals added to theAnthem to set this movement apart andencourage congregational singing.The next challenge was to make the musicfor the obligatory points a truly uniqueThe Journal of Thelemic Studies83The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"expression of the Gnostic Mass itself. For this Iwent directly to Liber XV and read the firstsection, “On the furnishings of the temple.” Sincemusic is a mathematical art form expressed inacoustic physics, it made sense to look forinspiration in the physical layout of the temple.The first thing that came to my attention was theTree of Life image seen when the temple isviewed from above, and particularly thehexagram whose center is the fire altaroccupying the point of Tiphereth:The hexagram is one of the most simpleand elegant ways of illustrating spiritual union,whether you call it enlightenment, Knowledgeand Conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel,the Sacred Marriage, or the Great Workaccomplished. And obviously, in the GnosticMass it is gnosis. For this image to exist at theheart of our temple as well as to be featured in somany of our most common rituals is no accident,and so I naturally asked myself how I couldsuggest the hexagram in music for Liber XV. Ifigured that since this hexagram is made up oftwo interlocking triangles, these would be easy torepresent in music notation like this:It made sense to have these musical“triangles” be as obvious to the ear as to the eyestudying the score, so that I wouldn’t have torequire listeners to be music theorists to make theconnection. To keep it simple and listenable, Isequenced these up and down triangles in aminimalist, Phillip-Glass style to create a sort ofmantra on “IO”, a Gnostic god-name usedfrequently in the Mass.

And so when I brought this idea togetherwith some harmonic coloring borrowed from thechoral section of H.K. 1131’s anthem, theundulating mantra could now be shaped toaccompany the serpentine walk of the Priestessall the way to the tomb.The triangle figures reappear in subsequentmovements of the piece, and the upward trianglealways appears with the downward, with onlytwo exceptions: the two obligatory points in theMass where the Body and Blood of God areindicated:The Journal of Thelemic Studies85The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Note that the upward triangle symbolizing fire isindicated for the Body of God, where thedownward triangle symbolizing water is indicatedfor the Blood of God. (These could conceivablybe reversed at the discretion of those officiating,if there is preference to symbolize fire with thedownward triangle and water with the upwardtriangle, following Eliphas Levi.)I also intended to keep the texts as simpleas possible, and to use only neutral vowel soundsand small phrases directly from Liber XV. Thishelps to keep focus on the action of the Mass,and to have the music be a comment on what ishappening in the ritual, rather than an actiontotally separated from the ritual. Nowhere is theall-too-familiar “church” moment where a miked-up cantor says, “Please turn in your hymnal tonumber 465...” and interrupts the regularlyscheduled program for a musical interlude. Theseamless flow from one action to the next in theGnostic Mass seems to call for music that simplyprovides an aura around what is already takingplace. The climax of the entire work is of coursethe Anthem of Fr. H.K. 1131, and the hummingsection that immediately follows to mark the finalobligatory point of music in Liber XV wasdesigned as a distant echo of one of theAnthem’s most distinguishing harmonies:The Journal of Thelemic Studies86The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"This is also the final appearance of themusical hexagram, and at this moment it moststrongly points toward the possibility of gnosisand the consummation about to take place.

What isthe E.G.C.-suggested way to make Cakes? IThough they are an important part of ourcentral public and private ritual, there is somedeviation in the method of producing Cakes ofLight. A quick search of the Internet will garneran assortment of recipes to choose from, but astandard recipe is not given.The Journal of Thelemic Studies88The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The E.G.C.

In Magick in Theory and Practice,Chapter XX: Of the Eucharist and of the Art ofAlchemy, the footnote to the suitability of Cakesof Light in the Eucharist of three elements,Crowley tells us: “The Cakes of Light are universallyapplicable; they contain meal, honey,and oil (carbohydrates, fats, and protein,the three necessaries of human nutrition):also perfume of the three essential typesof magical and curative virtue; the subtleprinciple of animal life itself is fixed inthem by the introduction of fresh livingblood.”The actual preparation of Cakes of Lightis not exactly the topic most expounded upon,as we can see. In this essay, I will address whatis to me one of the more controversialingredients: wine leavings. “How can wineleavings be controversial?“ one might ask.Simply put—most people do not know whatthey are. A survey of recipes finds that mostmakers are using something that I shall lovinglyrefer to as ‘wine goo’. This goo is made by asimple reduction of red wine or port,conducted at low temperature to avoidscorching the wine, and evaporating off the~10% ethanol and the large amount of the watercontained in the wine, until left with a fewtablespoons of a thick wine syrup. My firstbatch of Cakes was made with one of theserecipes replete with wine goo. Some lucky fewget the lees from wineries, which are essentiallypulp, grape skins, salts, and dead yeast. I amnot one of those few so my search continued.I wondered: are either lees or goo whatwas originally intended? As always, when facedwith this question, I turned to the commentaryfor direction or elucidation. A er all, who wouldknow better than Crowley how he interprets this?In the “New Comment” in the Law is for All,Crowley writes:“Meal: ordinary wheaten flour; leavings:the “beeswing” of port should be good;Oil of Abramelin: take 8 parts of oil ofcinnamon, four of oil of myrrh, two of oilof galangal, seven of olive oil.”Plain enough, right? We know what thoseoils are and the wheaten fl our is easy, but whatis this “beeswing of port” he references? Duringthe fermentation process, leavings settle to thebottom of the casks which contain salts that areThe Journal of Thelemic Studies89The Mysteries of the Gnostic Mass"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"ultimately formed into cream of tartar. Thistartarate is found in the lees of wine (rememberthe salts), but is best formed as a secondary crustin port and some wines, pure in consistency, thatcomes off in shining flakes or scales thatresemble bees’ wings, hence beeswing of port.The scales of tartar are a byproduct of thewine making process and have been used inbaking for years. In fact, grapes are the onlysignificant natural source; it is only in moderntimes that we are unaware of this byproduct, aswe tend to follow recipes more than understandthe chemistry involved. What is the purpose ofcream of tartar in baking? Even though I have itin my spice rack, I could not have told you whatit actually does before making my own Cakes ofLight led to this research, except its use inmeringue. A recipe calls for it, I use it, but I didnot know.In A Text-book of Sanitary and AppliedChemistry, or, The Chemistry of Water, Air, andFood (Summerfield, 1917), I found the followingentry: “Sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartarare often used to render dough light. Thefirst of these may be mixed with the flour,and the la er with the water that is used inmixing the dough, or both may be siftedand mixed with the flour... The tartarate ismade from 'argols' that are collected inthe bottom of wine casks in the process offermentation.”This instruction, however, calls for themixing of baking soda and cream of tartar (andincidentally makes baking powder), which makesthe dough lighter primarily due to the acid-basereaction of the alkali sodium bicarbonate and thetartaric acid salt, releasing carbon dioxide, thuslightening the dough with microscopic pockets ofgas. Our recipe does not call for baking soda;however, there is some argument for the creamof tartar leavening the dough through its ownreaction to heat. Honey itself is an acidiccompound, though, so why would we want touse cream of tartar, another acidic component?When used without the corresponding base, it isThe Journal of Thelemic Studies90The Mysteries of the Gnostic MassThe three main types of acid in grape berries, and thus in wine, are tartaric acid, malic acid, and to a lesser extent, citric acid. The leavings or lees that precipitate (fall out) during the wine making process contain the salts of these acids, such as potassium bitartarate, grape skins and pulp, and unused yeast.Citric AcidCitric acid concentration is low naturally, but can be increased intentionally to give wine an extra fruity fl avor. It is used to marinate meats, to give low-calorie beverages, sweets, and breads a sharp sour taste; in ice cream to prevent fat coagulation; and in bath products and vegetable washes as a mild antibacterial.Malic Acid Malic acid concentration is determined by grape variety and climate. It has similar application to citric acid, but is known to be more smoothly continuous in flavor than citric acid. It is o en used in extremely sour flavored candies.Tartaric AcidA Tartaric acid concentration is determined by grape variety. It is o en removed from wine using a cold filtration process. It is used in baking to stabilize and increase the volume of egg whites and to produce a creamier texture in sugary desserts. It is used commercially in so drinks, desserts, and photography products, and can be used to clean brass and copper cookware."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"said to make the dough stiff er and stronger,holding its shape well, thus making it a keyingredient in making your own play-dough. A stronger dough is sensible for makingthe perfume described in Liber CCXX, III: 23-4.I can also see how it would be useful in makingour Cakes, as can anyone who has seen a Cakeexplode into a rain of crumbs. Could that be itsonly purpose? Is it simply to lend stability to theshape of the Cakes? Or could it have aninteraction with the honey?In candy-making, an acid (cream of tartaror lemon juice) enhances a process calledinversion in the disaccharides such as sucrose,wherein the carbohydrate breaks down into itscomponent sugars, modifying the texture of thecandy. Honey being a polysaccharide wouldbenefit from this ‘inversion’ by preventing thecrystallization of the honey in the Cake, whichcan lead to the hard, crunchy Cakes you mayhave experienced. Honey is also hygroscopicand will bring moisture to the Cakes as they sit,stalling the process of going stale.In the article on Cakes of Light fromWikipedia, a recipe for making your own wineleavings is given, where grape juice is fermentedin a jug. It seems to be a very easy way toaccumulate “thick leavings of red wine,” but Ifind it unsuitable for my uses. Since thecommentary by Crowley calls for beeswing byname, he specifies which salt from the wine-making process we should use. The leavingsresulting from fermentation does not lead to theproduction of tartaric acid alone, but to a blendof tartaric, malic, and citric acids and their saltderivatives. The quantity of each acid beingdetermined by the growing location of the grapesused in the production of the grape juice, as therelative acidity is dictated by climate and soil.For those who wish to use the more complex“thick leavings” rather than the more purified saltidentified by Crowley, the Wikipedia recipeprovides an easy method to generate leavings.Using McGee’s On Food and Cooking:The Science and Lore of the Kitchen as a guide,I developed a basic recipe using the proportionsof a type of Cake that had the least amount ofeggs (which are obviously not an ingredient, butthe lost moisture they provide was easilyreplaced with honey instead of the morestandard sugar found in Cake recipes). Thetemperature shown is optimum for avoiding hardtexture or peaked surfaces in Cake-baking. Thistemperature is higher than most Cake of Lightrecipes call for, but seems reasonable based onbaking experience. I baked the thick and shiny batter in twoformats: individual cookies and a very thin sheetCake. The formula was off , and it tasted a littlelike play dough, with too much cream of tartarand not enough honey. It was also discoloredfrom the addition of ash, and frankly, the wineflavor and color were missed by some tasters.The Cakes themselves were best made in thesheet and then cut with my smallest biscuitcutter. They came out light, thin, and easilyeaten, not requiring a large amount of liquid towash down, which can be annoying in a Cake,and the honey did not crystallize.The following recipe was developed tocorrect the flavor and the hue:1/2-cup whole wheat fl our.3/4-cup all purpose fl our, unbleached.1/2-tsp cream of tartar1/2-tsp gnostic ashes1 1/4-cup pure honey.1/2-cup olive oil with several drops ofAbramelin oil.Pre-heat the oven to 350°F.

Thepurpose is to preserve the free, irregular rhythmof the words, while allowing more variety thansimple monotoning. Its structure is simpleenough to allow congregations to sing togethereasily, yet flexible enough to accommodateverses of varying lengths.AThe Collects of the EGC are essentiallyunmetrical poetry, and as such are well suited tothe structure of Anglican chant. There is,however, one major difference. The Psalms andCanticles in an Anglican church are meant to besung by either the congregation as a whole, or bya trained choir. In either case, they are written in4-part harmony. In the EGC Gnostic Mass, theDeacon alone intones the Collects. Thisprecludes the possibility of music in multipleparts. The harmonic aspects of Anglican chantare, however, entirely separate from the metricalaspects, and are not structurally essential. Wemay therefore discard the former while using thelatter for our purposes.The basic unit of chant is composed of tentones – a reciting tone followed by threeinflection tones, and a second reciting tonefollowed by five more inflection tones. This“single chant” sets one verse of text. A doublechant is twice as long, and sets two.
