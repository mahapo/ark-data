[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"1 PREMONSTRANCE Every individual human is destined to become an INITIATE & assist in the APOTHEOSIS of the ULTIMATE PARTICLE & all the Offspring of the EARTH, by accomplishing the GREAT WORK which makes supersensible wholly human. To this end you have been guided by your own HOLY.’.GUARDIAN.’.ANGEL.’. through all your past lives & in every step made in the present one right up to the very spot where & the moment when you shall begin to read what follows. You have within you that which can say “I” only when speaking of Itself. Within your EGO dwells the impulse which makes you aspire to ADEPTSHIP. Through the still, small voice of your own Conscience, which alone has absolute authority to govern your Destiny, you hear the voice of your own .’.DAIMON telling you that you are ready to accomplish the GREAT WORK. Genius or GODHEAD sleeps in every human brain. The potential MASTER is self-reliant & has the inherent presence of mind to meet an emergency. Let us pray that you have the divine instinct which can recognize the handwriting of the .’.DAIMON. “THE SCARLET HEART GIRT WITH AN EMERALD SERPENT IS MY NAME!” The .’.ORDER knocks but once at any single door. EVERY MAN & EVERY WOMAN IS A STAR. DO WHAT THOU WILT SHALL BE THE WHOLE OF THE LAW. In all the vast field of esoteric study & cryptic practice there is nothing whatever connected with genuine INITIATION unless it leads you to experience certain crucial events or CRISES, three in number, no more & no less. Thus the TRUE PATH is clearly marked from beginning to end. There is nothing vague, fanciful, visionary, or fantastic about INITIATE CONSCIOUSNESS. It is more exact & sharp than ordinary consciousness. The genuine school of INITIATION teaches you to handle & deal with real, not imaginary or merely symbolic forces. This school is the custodian of the True Secrets of the Universe & the Guardian of the SECRET RITE OF HUMANITY. It comprises 3 Colleges & confers 12 Grades or Degrees which embody & synthesize the Ten SEPHIROTH & the 22 Paths of the TREE OF LIVES & the true structure and activity of the COSMIC-MAN, who is extended in time back through previous lives & in space beyond the fixed stars, whose Head is above the Heavens & whose feet are below the Hells, but whose Heart beats by reason of the PURE GOLD of the EARTH. The first five Grades of the .’.ORDER constitute the Outer College & are related to the Powers of the ELEMENTS & the SPHINX. They conduct the Candidate up to & through the FIRST CRISIS, which must be the MAIN AIM until it is experienced & any discussion of what dwells beyond is premature & forbidden for it would only perplex & is"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 the policy of all genuine INITIATES to KEEP UTTER SILENCE concerning what does not pertain to the immediate needs of the pupil. There is only one genuine Fraternity of ADEPTS. Every INITIATE in the whole world belongs to this Fraternity. Neither geologists nor astronomers today can find the concrete truth about the earth’s age, creation, or the nature of “God” & all the hypotheses they & the physicists devise are fallacious & faulty. Modern attempts to interpret ancient records are childish. But the INITIATE has the KEY to the MYTHS which can unlock the Book of Books, the oldest religious document, which is no ordinary human discourse but comes from the MAIDS OF ZEUS, the Makers, the Bees, the Workers, the Archangels, the Cherubim–the Parents of Species & contains the Ordinance of the FIRE-WATERS, the whole tradition, phylogeny & destiny of the WHITE RACE. In medieval times a society founded by Manes in association with the reincarnated persons of Gautama Buddha , Zarathustra & Skythianos existed whose sole purpose was to guard, teach & preserve the SECRET RITE OF HUMANITY. But modern charlatans have stolen & appropriated the name of this society, so know this, that the true society now never under any circumstances reveals itself to the public by the old name. By this test you may distinguish the false; the true, you can recognize only when you are admitted to its ranks. Then no external proofs can increase your certitude for it will be impossible for you to doubt. As long as you do doubt the status & authority of any society to which you may now belong you can be absolutely certain of this–it is not the genuine Fraternity of ADEPTS whereof we speak, no matter what its claims. Note also, that no occult school can be legitimately an Outer College of the .’.ORDER unless its system provides a way to reach the FIRST CRISIS which experience infallibly marks the true ADEPT. No one can belong to this genuine Fraternity who has not yet experienced the FIRST CRISIS. The SUPREME SECRET of all PRACTICAL MAGICK is known to every true INITIATE; it is in the hands of the original & true .’.ORDER & it cannot under any circumstances be communicated to one who has not yet experienced the FIRST CRISIS, which is known as the ATTAINMENT of the KNOWLEDGE & CONVERSATION of the HOLY.’.GUARDIAN.’.ANGEL or .’.DAIMON & in Alchemy termed the MAGNUM OPUS & who accomplishes this GREAT WORK has the PHILOSOPHER’S STONE whereby to make the TRUE GOLD & secure the SUMMUM BONUM. But while the SECRET is as simple & easy to learn as riding a bicycle & might indeed be put in words of one syllable, yet no one can know it unless he passes through the ORDEAL of meeting face to face the DWELLER ON THE THRESHOLD when one penetrates the VEIL called PAROKETH which separates the Outer College from the Inner College of the .’.ORDER. This Threshold is no imaginary line, but is that which divides life from death, waking from sleeping. ADEPTSHIP is not conferred by diplomas! Initiate consciousness employs senses ordinarily dormant which can see & follow the soul when it leaves the body at death & which give exact cognition while the physical body & mind are asleep. Clairvoyance is graded according to the development of the organs of the Cosmic-Man which are definitely connected with the physiological functions. In Oriental doctrine these are termed Wheels or Lotus Flowers & by certain exercises they are opened & made to revolve. In simplest terms Initiation may be"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3 described as the development of the ability to think, feel & will with all the organs of the body. But first one must learn how to really think with the brain & then how to shut off this cerebral activity & attain other spheres of knowledge. At the FIRST CRISIS the three departments of the personality are equilibrated & their government taken over by the transcendent Self; one learns one’s true identity & purpose & every drop of blood is consecrated in the Shining Cup & one participates in the Cosmic-Sacrament with exact consciousness & understands the MYSTERY of the BORNLESS ONE, the Augoeides, the .’.DAIMON whose faint residual reflection or shadow is the Self in any single incarnation. Thus the work in the Outer College of the .’.ORDER is one-pointed, specific, logical, scientific, artistic & ethical. No oath is administered except to tell the TRUTH. The Candidate is taken by the SHORT CUT from which all non-essentials are rigidly eliminated straight to the Threshold by the ANCIENT WAY & his body & mind are disciplined & fortified by a regime which enables him to endure the ORDEAL, penetrate the VEIL & pass-by the DWELLER. Over 100 pages of documents are prepared so that we can deal with each Candidate by mail, but this is no ordinary “correspondence-course” & the majority are also in personal contact with an Immediate Superior whose duty is to guide & guard the Aspirant until ADEPTSHIP is attained & very little more help or advice is needed from external sources. The ULTIMATE ATTAINMENT is limited only by one’s wishes & desires. The enrollment fee is one dollar. Just before the third Grade there is another & final fee of six dollars, after which there are absolutely no further fees, dues or “alms” of any kind. Our business is to INITIATE, not to make money. Certain very valuable books are available to Members but these do not form part of the regular curriculum. Applicants must furnish the following Data–name in full, age, address, list of occult books & courses studied; names of any occult societies joined, with a brief outline of any occult experience previously had. Each Member is expected to secure at least one other Candidate who is confided to his charge & whom he in turn Initiates, so that Enlightenment may not be a solitary experience, for the Technic of passing the Barriers above lies in opening those below. The TRUTH of the Supersensible which brings FREEDOM must be brought down & expressed clearly to all those in the sensible world. General remarks on INITIATION & THE GREAT WORK can be found in articles published by MR C F RUSSELL in the OCCULT DIGEST issues of 1930 May, July, Aug., Oct., Nov., & Dec., also Nov. 1931 & Nov. 1932; in the COSMIC DAWN July & Oct. 1930; in the MYSTIC WORLD May 1931.

Davis [who can be reached at fratersi@yahoo.com with “CC/GBG” on the subject line. Also, the fee is waived as there is not longer the question of postage cost. Add to the Data sent the place, time, and date of birth.]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 RELEASED FOR USE OF MEMBERS OF THE CHORONZON CLUB IN BUILDING THEIR MAGICAL HIERARCHIES, BY AUTHORITY OF THE COLLEGIUM AD SPIRITUM.’.SANCTUM.’.
