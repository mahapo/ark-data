Therefore, we ask the friends of this thought to aid us in its dissemination, and thus help those who are ready to receive it, to gain a higher plane of development.

The greatest use with the least t'llil result is the best thing to do under aU circumstances. BEFORE introducing our subject, we will answer a question that nearly always arises when a statement is made similar to the title of these instructions, viz. : what will be accom-plished by following these instructions? Our answer is a promise based on the per-sonal experience of many, many years of unbiased examination of the cause of suc-cesses, failures, inharmonies, sickness and death. Having opportunities placed before us that very few, if any, persons ever had, we can speak from that unfailing authority-know-ledge; and we promise you who peruse the thoughts hereinafter given, and carefully follow all their suggestions, that after two years of faithful adherence thereto, you will never be sick : you will never be in need of money or friends: whatever you undertake will be succe&£ful : your mental capacity will Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"JIRACTJCAL MltTIIODI. ,, continually increase as long as you Jive: your (fomestic relations will be very happy, and your children will be superior to all others; and when you leave this world, the people will cherish your memory, and be thankful that you lived. These promises are of such an extraordinary nature, that they may call forth doubt and criticism : we do not object to that, but would ask you not to condemn anything until you know it to be unworthy. The habit of de-nouncing things about which you know nothing, dwarfs the intellect, stupefies the sensibilities, and retards normal growth; therefore, deny nothing, no matter how absurd it seems, until you know better. In this course of instructions we shall make no effort to exhaust the subject treated; on the contrary, we intend to deal with general principles, and depend upon your own good, common sense to carry them out to their legiti-mate conclusion. This work is based on Jaws governing natural forces, which are of such a nature, as always to furnish conclusive evidence to the practitioner every step of the way, so that no one will need to depend on our word, except tor a very short time-probably three months, Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"8 PRACTICAL METHODS. before receiving good and sufficient evidence of the truth of what we claim. Therefore, we are relieved from that long and tedious method in this line, that was necessary to those grand souls, Herbert Spencer, Charles Robert Dar-win, and all others of that class of thinkers and world's pioneers: they spent many years over a single thought, collecting all evidences available before giving it to the world ; because the truth of their statements depended upon those evidences. The evidence of the truth of what we say is immediately obtainable by following the instructions we give herein; so we will leave you to judge of their merits by the light of your own experience, and your own interior and reasoning mind. The many testi-monialS of those that have tried them, which can be found in \" The Esoteric Magazine \" of April and May, 1891, are proof enough to con-vince any intelligent person of their true value. Our methods are not an unnatural stimulus, bringing about a hot-house growth, as some would have you believe, but are intended to remove the hindering causes, and allow nature to do her work in accordance with her own laws. I have often been asked the question:-\" If these are natural laws that bring about such Digitize' 'YGoogle ·"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. 9 marvellous results, why have they not been known and applied before now?\" I may be able to answer this question when you can tell me why the great utility of steam and electricity, as well as many other important discoveries and inventions, was not known prior to the nineteenth century. Our race has a development transcending that of prior ages; and on that account you, dear reader, have an active desire for a higher and better condition. That heartfelt desire is a prayer that is heard and answered by the source from which we derive our intelligence. Again, it is a law in the economy of nature, that there cannot exist a general desire for anything that is unattainable; therefore, these instructions are the answer to the silent prayers of hundreds of thousands now living. The way to gain knowledge is to cull from all sources facts that will be of use to us; discriminating carefully between the erroneous and the true and useful; but always remember-ing that nature is constantly developing higher capabilities, and thercfQre your mind is more capable than many of the great minds of the past, or may be by a proper course of training.

We hope that no one will pick out certain points in these teachings and follow them and ·exclude the rest, and then condemn the teach· ings because they obtain only partial results. If you desire all the results, apply all the methods. Do not ignore the elementary part because it is simple, for remember, it is the small things of life that are important in form-ing the greater. We are apt to jump at conclusions, without taking into consideration changing circum-stances, or the power there is in the motive behind the act. We purpose to build a great structure, the top of which shall reach to heaven, and the expanse of which shall take in all the coming generations; therefore, we begin on bed-rock, and no stone must be ldt out of the foundation.

Pain was the result of sin against nature: pleasure was the harmonious action of the senses with nature: the former became a probe, a scourge, to drive us into obedience with Jaws; and the latter, a bribe, to lead us forward in self-preservation. Herein was laid the foundation of fear of pain and desire for pleasure, which were to form the cause of struggle. Pleasure and pain, alike, are caused by the motion of life: either are exhausters of life and weakening to the organism ; no one being able to endure the intensity of either very long. We can endure pleasure longer than pain, because it is harmonious action ; while the latter is inharmonious. All nature is motion, -a song of harmony; therefore, moderate pleasure is productive of continuous vigour. Health is the normal state; so that the first thing to be sought for is health or harmony with nature, which is the same thing, one being the cause, the other, the effect.

When this is accomplished, there will be a foundation laid that will permanently lift our race to a much higher plane of thought, capacity, and action ; hence our reason for persisting in repeating them.

EvERY application of natural law to the governmeDI: and development of the physical body reacts upon the mind; and every effort in the right direction ramifies into all depart-ments of life, producing desirable results. The first essential step is to free the body and mind from the bondage of habit; and this is no easy matter, unless you begin just right, when it becomes a pleasurable task. The proper point at which to begin is in the selec-tion of the kind and quality of food,-begin to eat to live instead of living to eat; in so doing, eating is governed by the reason. It has been said that, a normal appetite is a correct guide to the supply of nourishment needed by the body, and so it is; but who has a normal appetite? Do many in our present civilization possess such? No, not many; then, in order to intelligently find this normal appetite, and to establish it physically, you must abstain Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. from all articles of food not absolutely essential to you. Perhaps we may now be speaking to one who is a slave to intoxicating drinks, if so, he will at once say: I know that it is wrong, and should give it up, but I cannot :-it may not be strong drink, but some other habit or habits. Then, do not begin with the effort to give up intoxicants, or whatever the habit may be; begin at the table, first, by stopping the use of tea and coffee; and after a week or two, stop using condiments in your food, such as pepper, spices, much salt, etc. ,-they do not nourish you, and only create an abnormal appetite. The effort to do this will strengthen your will so that you can discontinue using pie and cake, and then-pork. Remember, that the nature of every animal is in its flesh. See what an insatiable appetite the swine has;· you are trying to get hold of your appetite,-then, stop using the very embodiment of it. By the time you have succeeded thus far, your desire for fermented liquors will be under your con-trol, and abstemiousness in eating and drinking will begin to be a delight to you. It will produce in you a feeling of power heretofore unknown, and a desire to proceed further will manifest itself; then you will be ready to Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. 15 undertake the more difficult task of overcoming those habits by which you have been enslaved. We have referred to pork as the embodi-ment of alimentiveness. A little observation will show that appetite and passion are twins; therefore, we are fully persuaded that a large per cent. of the lowest and most vicious habits that degrade our race, arises from the use of pork. You will observe, that after eating a hearty meal of which this has been one of the principal viands, you are still conscious -of an unsatisfied craving. You may resort to tobacco, which for a time partially satisfies, but you soon want something else. Intoxicating drinks or opium is called into requisition, or worse, illicit association for sensual gratifica-tion ; so that this appetite enters into all departments of life ; and nearly the same results follow the use of all kinds of flesh food. In referring to the subject of abstemiousness in eating, let us indulge in a little metaphysical physiology. · The mind governs digestion. It is observed that sudden and great fright, sadness or joy, often arrest digestion, and have even been the cause of death. Criminals have been sen-tenced to die by poison, and coloured wate( Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"16 PRACTICAL METHOD!. administered in the name of poison has caused their death. Mental healers perform remarkable cures by the psychic power of mind. The majority of physicians know that the confidence of the patient in the remedy, is as potent as the chemicals administered. It is known that a radical change in the kind of thought will produce a change in the appetite, causing a desire for unusual kinds of food. The reason for this lies in the fact that th~ mind is in direct relation to chemistry : certain qualities are essential to certain kinds of thoughts, from the elements of which, thoughts are formed. Every seed, when planted, will produce its own peculiar structure, and certain chemical combinations are essential to its growth into that structure. The kind and quality of plant is indicated by its form; therefore, we conclude that certain elements must be present in the systBm in their proper relation, otherwise the form will not be manifest. Thought is form, and therefore must be and is formed of something. Those who labour with either hands or brain find that they must feed the body in proportion to the demand made upon it."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. 17 Intense mental activity exhausts the body, and food is the means of supply. If this is so, and it is a fact known to all, then, it follows that whatever thought is kept active while taking and digesting food, will cause the body to select from the food and to assimilate the elements requisite to produce like thought. Hence, while eating, if the thought to develop power and self-control is paramount, that function of mind will be the one abundantly supplied, and the one which will grow rapidly and exert its influence in the direction desired. Evidences and arguments in support of this very important thought would fill volumes; but, the mind that practises all these methods of self-culture will perceive and comprehend the value of them. We quote the following extract from Dr. J. H. Kellog's \"Domestic Hygiene and Rational Medicine,\" page 361, Food and Diet:-\" Since the human body is made of what is received into it in the form of food, it is evident that the character of a person's food will determine the character of his body. Experiments have again and again proved this to be true of animals, and it can be no less true of human beings. A few facts bearing on this 8"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"18 PRACnCAL MttHODS. point may not be without interest to the general reader. \" It has been found that the bones of hogs which have been fed on food coloured with madder, a peculiar colouring matter, were stained the same colour. When herbivorous animals are fed on animal food, their flesh acquires an unpleasant and unpalatable flavour. \" M. Monclar, a ·French agriculturist, has been experimenting upon this subject, and finds that he can flavour the flesh of animals at pleasure by feeding them upon various kinds of food and employing a variety of strong flavouring substances. He was led to investi-gate the subject by the observation that hares killed in a wormwood field, and eggs laid by hens that had eaten diseased silk-worms, had such a nauseous taste, that no one could eat them. These facts accord well with an ac-count which we published, some years ago, of the poisoning of a family by eating chickens which had fed upon potato-bugs. A few years ago, also, a case was reported in which a family in Ohio were poisoned, some fatally, by eating chickens which had feasted upon the. carcass of a cow that died of milk-sickness. \" Foco El.E~S NOT FOOI).-By .. meaos.-Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL M21'IJODS. 19 of numerous experiments at the expense of numberless dogs, rabbits, pigeons, cats, and other animals, it has been clearly demonstrated that, while the various elements mentioned are food elements, they are not in themselves food, either when taken alone or when artificially mixed. · \" Dog!i fed on albumen, fibrin, or gelatine-the constituents of muscle-died in about a month. The same results followed when they were fed on the constituents of muscle arti-ficially mixed. A goose fed on the white of egg died in twenty-six days. A duck fed on butter starved to death in three weeks, with the butter exuding from every part of its body, its feathers being saturated with fat. Dogs fed on oil, gum, and sugar, died in four or five weeks. A goose fed on gum died in sixteen days: one fed on sugar, died in twenty-one days: two that had only starch, lived twenty--four and twenty-seven days. Dogs fed on fine, white-flour bread, lived but fifty days: dogs fed on brown military bread, made of the whole grain, were maintained in perfect health : dogs fed on the so-called inorganic elements,-the salts which are extracted from. ttesh,-died seoner than tho~ which had nothing at all· \" _ Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"20 PRACTICAL METHODS. The importance of food, mental conditions, and surroundings, as factors of refinement and growth, is illustrated in the rapid trans-formation which takes place in many of the immigrants to this country. A striking exemplification of this is furnished by the Irish immigrants of the lower classes, who arrive here very coarse and low down in the scale of manhood or womanhood, but whose children have scarcely a trace of resemblance to their parents. It cannot be questioned that their habit of thought and surroundings are the cause of the refining miracle wrought in these children. All this is a powerful suggestion of first, the necessity of beautiful and harmonious surroundings; second, cultured associations; and third, proper care as to the kind, quantity, and quality of food taken. It has been observed that health and happi-ness are the results of a life in harmony with the laws of our being. At this point in your experience, you will observe that there are two kinds of sensation, each being characterized by a sub-division of pleasurable and painful sensations. The first or principal division is the sensations of the body, and pleasure or pain of the mind. While, in the ordinary per-son, mind and the sensations of the bod1 are"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. 21 in their normal conditions inseparable, yet, one or the other always leads and governs. It is generally admitted that happiness is the aim of life; therefore, in the \" Declaration of Independence\" of the United States, we have these words: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created free and equal, and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" This is true; but have they obtained the object of their pursuit? It is claimed by those who have made a study of this subject, that there is only a small percentage of happiness in the world, while the capital stock is of the opposite character. Was this the design of our Creator? 0 no! yet, the laws governing this state of things are in accord with His design. The cause of this failure to realize happiness is, that the people have centred their minds upon the physical organism, and regard that, instead of the intelligence, as the real self. This is delusive. All pleasure arisin~ in the physical body reacts upon the mind, producing pain in that direction, because it is a disturbance of the normal actioa of life. A wise soul once said Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. to me: u I do not like to have any sensatioes in my body, for, when the body is normal it has. no sensatie>ns.\" This is true. Is there any sensation in your hand when it is lying quietly by your side? no; but if a fly lights upon it, you feel it. If you are pricked by a pin it hurts: why? because the life is disturbed in its normd action. There is no taste in the mouth, unless something of a foreign nature is taken ·into it ; then, the sense of taste is excited, and with it Nature makes conditions to adart itself to the work of taking care of this substance. And so it is with every sensa-tion; it is a disturbance of the J.ife,-life in motior., and this is exhaustion. In advanced souls there is a constant desire for-what? While looking wholly to the senses. they try in every conceivable way to gratify them, and thereby, sometimes, form destructive habits; but every effort in this direction brings pain and disability, mentally and physically. That desire, then, must arise from some need in the mind. When you begin the practice of ignoring the senses, except as informants of conditions needing the attention of the mind : when you con&tantly regard the body as a chemical laboratory through w~~cf:! Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"'RACTICAL METHODS\". !3 you have access to all the qualities of nature, and the senses as sentinels that inform you of conditions and demands-you being the Master -the mind controlling-then you will begin to know what happiness is. The act of control-ling your own body will create within you a consciousness of power that is both pleasurable and profitable; but seeking pleasure through the senses is always disastrous. The distinguishing characteristic of man is to seek his pleasure through the gratification of the mental tendencies, while the animal lives wholly in the gratification of the appetites and passions. You desire to be more than a mere animal? then, Jive in the mind. Your animal body is yours, not you, but is so constructed as to serve you in the most important ways ; therefore, it must be well cared for,-even more than a valuable horse, for its sphere of service is not only to carry you around, but to ada:pt you to uses in the material world, and to supply you with elements and conditions for thought: methods for obtaining knowledge, as well as for growing capacity to think and act. Few realize to what extent their bodies are deranged by abuses and neglect. It is a rare thing to find one whose body is in proper work-ing order.

The mental disturbance of the dyspeptic is well understood, and is evidence that every disorder in eating and drinking will react upon the mind. These small obstacles must be removed if you desire to actually increase the mind powers; and in doing this you accomplish just as much in every other direction. Disordered sensations are deceitful guides; and as sensations are generally of this character, a stoic habit of life is necessary, until all of them have been brought into harmony, so that they will report faithfully.

THE following methods necessarily serve as the ways and means for not only establishing the health of the body, but also for strengthen-ing every faculty of the mind. Every practical physician knows that disease can, in a great degree, be arrested by active energy of the mind, put into operation in the physical body. It is well known that disease can be thrown off by positive action, and that people who are discouraged, and who have little or no energy of will, are sick all the time. Sometimes housewives get into a discouraged condition, aod for that cause alone are under the doctor's care continuously: on the other hand, it is observed that persons who are active have no time to be sick. If they get up in the morning feeling \" poorly,\" they rally their will and begin to rush around: you ask them: \"Are you not feeling well to-day?\" \"0 yes,\" they Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"26 PRACTIC:\\L METHODS. say, .. I am all right, I cannot be sick,\" etc. This thought, .. I cannot be sick,\" is the vital centre of the system of mental healing, under its various names; because, if one can con-fidently resist disease, and knows how to resist it, he will conquer it in all its forms. The ability to resist adverse physical condi-tions can be carried so fu as to actually overcome the effect of poisonous drugs. A gentleman, in business in Philadelphia, told me the following story : •• The druggist next ·door, by mistake, took a powerful narcotic. From his knowledge of the powe:-of the drug he knew that he must die, but his will would not yield. He walked the ffoor until, becom-ing exhausted, he would drop into a chair, sntil, feeling the stupor coming over him, he would spring to his feet, and with all the will he could rally, stamp across the floor, until his strength failing, he would again drop into a chair; and he persisted until he conquered the effects of the drug, and saved his life. \" Proverbs xxiii. 7. says of a man: .. For as he thinketh in his heart, so ii he. \" Yes, true; whatever we can believe without a doubt, is a verity. Paul said of this principle of unwaver-ing belief: \" Faith is the SUBSTANCE of things hoped fer, the E\\'lD£~c£ of things not seen. •• Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"PltACTlCAL METHODS. 27 The methods given in the lesson upon dietetics (First Lesson), are the first essential steps in the direction of the acquisition of this faith ; and the following rules of action, more than the methods heretofore given, are such, that an observance of them furnishes sufficient evidence of their importance. In order to conquer disease, you must deny its right or power over you: for example, if you have a pain which retards certain move-ments of the body or limbs, those movements are the ones you should make in as positive a way as i& possible without injury. If you feel dull and inactive, take active exercise. Keep in your mind the clearly defined difference between the physical senses and the intellec-tual consciousness. Remember that you are superior to and can control every sensation of the body; and with this thought as a basis, you can cause the body to obey your wilJ, even to excluding disease. We often hear imagination referred to as a prolific source of disease; if this is true, why ~nnot the imagination be made to serve as a meads of cure. If the imagination is potent in one case, it certainly must be in the other: united . with a firm belief, it will kilJ or cure anyone. -.... ;-. . .. Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"28 PRACTICAL METWODS. THE CARE OP THB SKIN.-The skin is full of little pores or tubes, from which a large amount of the effete matter of the body exudes. In the case of active persons, two or three days are sufficient for a coating to form over the body similar to that of varnish. This coating is composed of acid and fatty substances, and a little perspiration causes it to decompose, which produces an offensive odour. This process not only closes the pores of the skin and produces a languid feeling in the body and mind, but there also springs into existence an insect parasite called dtmodtx follimlarum. We will not attempt to describe in detail these savage little brutes, with eight legs and sharp claws, and sharp lancets for puncturing and burrow-ing into the skin, producing an itching, and sometimes eruptions similar to the disease called \" mange,\" common to dogs; and it does not take very long to produce these results if the proper amount of bathing is neglected. We, in a measure, breathe through the pores of our skin, and if they were all closed, we would die almost as quickly as if the lungs were deprived of air. These pores or tubes are provided at the outer surface with muscles by means of which they open and close : they open when the body is wai'Dl, and close when it is Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL MIITI:IODS. 29 cold. When we are cold we close or C:lraw together these pores to prevent the heat from escaping; and when they are healthy and in good working order, we are not apt to \" catch cold,\" or to be quickly chilled when cold air strikes us. Use is most essential in order to keep these muscles in proper condition, so that they will serve us as nature intended : like all other muscles if not used for a long time, they cease to obey the will. If we carry one of our arms in a sling and do not use it for a long time, we will find that it wilt take considerable effort to make it obey our will when we desire to use it again; and so it is with persons living in an even, warm temperature, they lose the ability to close these pores, and a cold wind blowing on them chills them and produces a cold. When those in whom the pores are inactive get into a very cold bed, touch the body with cold water, or allow the cold air to blow on them, it gives a shock to their system that they can scarcely endure. To teach you how to gain control of the muscular movement of the pores: to avoid colds: to keep off contagious diseases; and to conquer and take control of the body, the following advice is given:-lst.-Never sleep io a heated room; and Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. keep at least one window wide open so as to admit plenty of fresh air, NO MATTER HOW COLD THE WEATHER. 2nd.-Never sleep in a garment worn during the day. 3rd.-The bed should be well aired, and kept fresh by frequent exposure to the sun. 4th.-Never sleep in a room that the si.Jn cannot enter. 5th.-Aiways take off all your clothing and rub your body over with your hands before putting on your night robe. If you are of the class who are sensitive to cold, etc., make it a rule to take a cold douche immediately upon rising in the morning. Have at hand a coarse, dry towel and a woollen cloth ; each of these should be long enough to admit of taking an end in each hand ; one over your shoulder, the other behind you. Use water the temperature of the atmosphere of the room, or as nearly so· as practicable. Dip the wooDen cloth in the cold water, and wring it so that it will not drip, and wet the neck and back with it, after which rub the wet parts of the body dry and warm with the crash towel. Then wet the front of-the body, and dry in a similar manaer; then the limbs and feet-fii'St one, then the other; Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"PRACnCAL M'ETHODS. 31 rubbing one warm and dry before wetting the other; and lastly, the anns. Now, rub the body with the hands until all indications of dampness are gone, and the skin feels smooth and soft and warm : do this vigorously, and then move about the cold room untiJ the cold air strikes every part of the body. The morning cold water bath may be pre· ceded by a warm water bath with the free use 'Of ·soap! after which use the cold water, as above directed. This warm watef' cleansing bath is not essential oftener than once a week, unless you eat a good deal of meat and perspire very freely, when twice a week is the outside limit. When you get so that the cold water, the cold air or the cold bed, feels good to you, then these cold baths should be taken every second morning; and on alternate mornings in place of the cold bath, rub the body with a dry towel, and take the cold air bath. It will be better· for ladies whose vitality is low not to take these cold baths oftener than every third mortling.

The philosophy of these directions is this: while the body is comfortably warm, no effort is made to close the pores; but when the body meets the cold air, they are closed by its inclination to draw itself together. If the muscles of the pores have not been used in this way for a long time, we have lost control of them, and the cold air rushes in and chills the system, and diseases the flesh, or we \"take cold. \" We know that if we cut, bruise, or burn the flesh, and expose the injured part to the cold, we take cold in it, and it becomes inflamed, fevered, and very sore. This is because the cells become chilled in consequence of the muscles, just mentioned, being atrophied, which renders it impossible to shut the cold out; but these cold baths put them in a healthy, active condition.

Then, let those of sedentary habits dress im-mediately, and as quickly as possible go out for a rapid walk, so as to cause quick, full breathing, and on their return take half a glass or even a glassful of cold water before eating breakfast, or, if found preferable, take the water before the walk.

Practise decisiveness of thought and action; that is, let every motion be made for a purpose that is well defined in your own mind; and in everything that you do, study to make as few motions as possible, and this will greatly aid your mind in forming the habit of careful deliberation. Guard well your words, so that you may not say anything except what you mean, and what you yourself fully compre-hend; and as you express an idea, think of the meaning of every word, and use no more words than are necessary to convey the idea. This will create confidence in mind of your hearer, in your intelligence. Avoid all con. firma tory efforts; they bring a conviction of weakness and falsity. We often hear such expressions as : \" If you do not believe it, I can prove it by 'so and so';\" \" I mean what I say,\" etc., to say nothing of much worse forms,-the effort to confirm by an oath, or the wish of evil upon one's self if it is not true.

Avoid haste: be calm and de-liberate in all your acts, thoughts, and words: never, under any circumstances, allow yourself to become excited. Laughter, when it is too hearty, weakens the power of the mind; avoid it. Do not be too slow of speech ; first think of what you want to say, and then say it without halting or hesitation. Study the tone qualities of your voice. A person living wholly in the excited animal senses pitches the voice very high. You, who think as MEN AND WOMEN, modulate your voice to suit the distance of your hearers, and consciously speak TO THE · INTELLIGENCE, AND 1'\\0T TO THE SENSES OF YOUR AUDIENCE. Many judge of character by the tone qualities of the voice: a thoughtful person meeting one whose voice is pitched to a high key, at once loses all confidence in and seeks to get away from him; it grates on the finer sensibilities and causes great repulsion.

For this purpose he employed the greatest architect on earth, plac-ing in his hands unlimited means with which to build the most beautiful structures possible.

That young man or young woman may be you, dear reader, and that most beautiful structure, your body. Now, is it not well to commence house-cleaning? If methods of bouse-cleaning are a lesson you have never learned, we will give you a few practical sug-gestions in that direction. The habit is prevalent of eating whoJJy for the gratification of the appetite, gorging the alimentary canal with flesh, with all kinds of pastry, and, too often, with intoxicating beve-rages, together with tea, coffee and tobacco; all of which create a morbid appetite. How seldom you think of the mass of corruption in your body, caused by all the delicate leaves that line the intestines being coated over by the slimy matter taken as food, remaining there until decomposition sets in, when the breath becomes heavy with the odour, and the emana-tions of the skin are so laden with the fumes of the matter, that many days before should have .beeP passed oft with the excretions of the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"(0 PltACTJCAL METHODS. body, that any sensitive person who is truly keeping his house in order can smell them as he sits with you in, perchance, the elegant drawing-room, church, or railroad car. Those who Jive in and are surrounded by such condi-tions become so accustomed to the vile odour that they do not notice it. They frequently wash the body, and the mere suggestion of uncleanness would be an insult to them : but the skin, once fair, has become dark, the pores closed, and their temper morbid and irritable. Women cover up these defects with paint and powder, and, in their \"fix up,\" they look beautiful; but, within, they are putrid with diseases, such as dyspepsia, constipation, and a host of other disorders arising therefrom; and, generally speaking, the more abundant their wealth, the more thoroughly are they dis-ordered. The man or the woman who is forced to keep up excessive exercise has less of the unessentials, as activity works off a portion of this matter; so that the poor man or woman really enjoys the best health. The methods for cleansing the body should be heroic, in order that the individual may at the same time gain control of the appetite aad sensations. In the first place, we advise fasting. A young Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. person can make the first fast one of forty-eight hours' duration: an elderly person of reglllar ha/Jits had ~letter continue the first fast only twenty-four hours. After the twenty-four hour fast, wait a week or ten days, and then take a five tlay fast. During the time of fasting take nothing into the mouth to start the gastric secretions, or cause the mouth to water; in fact, take nothing into the mouth but pure, cold water; otherwise, you may injure the stomach. It wiJI be observed that after the first twenty-four hour fast, it is much easier to go through with the second, and after the second, the third ; notwithstandil'lg, in the majority of cases, an appetite of intense activity wiJI be excited, and by some, great difficulty will be experienced in controlJing it sufficiently to abstain from eating too much. Herein you will bave a splendid driJI for the will: it always follows that they who have the greatest need of development in will-power, have the greatest difficulty in controlling the appetite. To prevent the hardening of the feces in the colon, it is welt, after fasting, to flush the colon with warm water, whether the fast is one of twenty-four hours, forty-eight hours, or five days; but, in the latter case, it is well to de tbis th,.. or four till* durine the fast: the Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"42 PRACTICAL METHODS. proper time for doing this is on retiring nt Bight. In order to wash out all effete matter, it is well to inject into the colon at least two quarts of water; expelling it as fully as-possible ; then inject a pint and retain it all night, and it will be absorbed through the walls and taken up in the water passages. The desired result will be obtained by the expulsion of all the warm water taken. Cases of prenatal disease can be entirely eradicated from the system by a fast of from twelve to fourteen days. During these fasts you should be constantly active, and hold a positive mental attitude toward the bodily con-ditions, keeping active the consciousness of the difference between your own real self, the thinking, conscious person, and the sensating animal body. On breaking the fasts, or at least the longer ones, we advise that you first take corn, roasted brown all through, and either chew at least one half pint of it, or grind it in a coffee mill and eat it: roasted wheat, such as is sold for dyspeptics, will also answer the purpose. This should be taken two hours before taking your first meal ; and if desired, you may eat tomatoes with the corn. In case the stomach sours, eat some salt fish, which Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"l'RACTICAL YETHOD8,· 43 «ill sweeten and put it in proper conCfition. The coarse corn, wheat or granula, will serve as a scrubbing-brush to carry off the coating from the alimentary canal, and put vitality into those leaves that line the cavity, and will open up the lacteals; so that whatever is eaten will fully nourish the body. The habit of continu. ally eating causes inaction of the secretory glands, but, after you have ceased eating for five days, you start a thoroughly reverse action. The fatty material is near the surface of the body; and when you stop the food supply, this is first used up : much of the effete matter is thus returned to the alimentary canal, and really forces open the lacteals, working with them as if they were a sponge: on pour-ing water containing sediment through a sponge, its pores fill and a coating forms over it until no more water can pass through; but, reverse the sponge, pour the water through the other way, and the pores will be cleansed. In this way your digestive apparatus will be cleansed, and at the same time your blood purified, enabling the system to throw off what-ever diseased states may exist in the body; your appetite will be restored to a condition of youthful purity, and if the fast is properly con-ducted, all the senses will be placed with'n the Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METftODS. control of your will. You should not be too active during this time, and those who are engaged in physical labour, or a business that requires much mental strain, had better take a vacation while fasting. Most people form a habit of eating, not only certain articles of food, but also certain quan-tities at regular intervals; this causes a demand for a continuance of the food supply, without regard to the actual needs of the body; but this habit must be overcome before the body will serve according to the demands made upon it by occasional extra activity. It is at such times that people break down ; sometimes this occurs when it entails immense losses. It will be obsen·ed that after a fast your appetite enables you to take on flesh very rapidly. By a careful examination of your mental clearness and physical buoyancy, you should determine what amount of flesh you carry best; and when you have as much as gives you the best results, lessen the guantity of food, but not the quality; for you should study to take such quantities as best serve your needs. Feed your body as a fireman does his boiler; when the pressure of steam is low, he feeds his fire, but when the pressure is high, he withholds the fuel, and so should you. Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. Dr. Tanner, and Succi, lost about three-quarters of a pound of flesh per day; but when they began eating, they put on one and one-half pounds per day,-just double the amount of the loss durinr the fast. This evideaces how perfectly one can take control of the supply and exhaust of his body. When you have this control, and are forced into extreme mental or physical strain, or both, you can then supply the extra demand, so that marvellous results will be obtained. We must again emphasize the importance of the use of a decisive will in bringing the body into subjection. The habit of following the dictates of the senses is far more common than is usually believed. Persons may have suffi-cient control of themselves to stop eating as directed, and drag the body around like an arm hanging by one's side, never throwing the will of energy into it ; but in such cases very few of the most important results will be obtained. The body should be handled with a decisive will, at the same time giving it plenty of rest.

During aU these drills constant restraint should, from the first, be kept over the sex passions; for, in some cases, the most exhausting activity will arise in the course of these exercises. Bear in mind, that the function of the sexual organs is: first, to generate the seed, which, if retained in the body, will be reabsorbed, and will supply it with new and increased life: second, to pro-duce offspring when such are desired. More will be given upon this subject in the next lesson. The Hindu Stoic finds that by binding fertile soil on the body, over the stomach, will enable it to draw enough nourishment therefrom to supply its needs while fasting. This shows that the outer surface of the body can absorb nourishment as well as the internal organs. The natural method for obtaining nourishment, is to take into the stomach the seeds of cereals, properly prepared, as the digestive organs can absotb from these the necess~ry elements to repatr the con&taot waste going oo iD tho Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":".

You should also keep the inner pores open and clean, just as you do the outer surface of the body; for the lacteals are similar to the pores of the outer skin, and a11 nourishment is obtained by means of absorp-tion. Therefore, lay aside the very deceptive dream that eating to please the appetite is the unchangeable condition of life: you are more than an animal, yet animals eat more correctly than you do.

This need we wish herein to supply, for we consider it of greater im-portance than all the other sciences combined. Regarding these fasts, we wish it distinctly understood, that they are not to be taken at regular intervals, but, as one takes medicine-when absolutely needed.

What does the spider do with the immense amount of food it eats? In propor-tion to its size it consumes what would be equivalent to your eating a whole sheep for breakfast, an ox for dinner, and a yearling calf for supper. What becomes of all that nourish-ment? In the summer, when they are active, look for one of the spiders that has a large sack attached to it: carefully open the sack, which is often many times larger than the spider, and you will see scores of diminutive spiders in it. These are the product of the food it has taken. Again, watch the worm feeding on a green leaf, of which it eats large quantities: its body is almost a hollow sheath filled with the sap of the leaves, from which it absorbs the nourishing elements for its growth, passing off the refuse as a dry deposit. The food which you take is transformed into a fluid, and finally passes into the colon. On its way through the body, the proper elements for nourishment are absorbed from it, and in the colon it is finally hardened and passes off as in the case of the worm.

As man possesses a mind, and varied capacities for using this life otherwise than in the mere production of his kind, we may reasonably inquire if'there is a way by which he may utilize it for the increase of self in all its parts and functions. We know that those who are overworked have little or no desire for the act' of procreation; also, that minds under constant mental strain seldom think of it. This evidences, that, either in action of body or mind, man may utilize this life-element gener-ated in the body. If this is true, and we think that all persons of experience and thought will agree that it is, then it is certain that the reservation of this element in the body is essen-tial to the power of mind and body. -Even to the casual observer the evidences bearing upon this subject are too patent for dispute.

In course of time she marries; and after a few weeks or months at most, you again meet her; the rose is gone from her cheeks; the lustre from her eyes; the joyous smile from her face. Instead of bounding along as if her body had no weight, she moves heavily, and dark clouds are under her eyes. Take her hand: it is cold and moist. Pass her by and call on her at the end of the year. Now she begins to look pale and thin. Ask her what has been the matter, and she answers: \" Oh, I have been sick; I do not feel well now.\" What has wrought this change in so short a time? Certainly, there must be something very wrong in the marital habits. Nature always rewards the obedient with abundance of her good; but, always punishes the sinner against her laws, and never excuses because of ignorance: the God of nature does not remove the sentence that nature imposes, even in answer to devout prayer. But, follow that young woman fur-ther; see her after twenty years. She is now worn and aged : around her are several children.

What do all these symptoms mean? \\Vhat do they evidence against this young man? That he is injudiciously squandering his life in secret vices, and consequently is devoid of animation in mind and body. He lacks all the con-stituents of growing manhood, and is an easy prey to almost any vice that may be placed in his way. It is largely from this class that the recruits for our prisons, insane asylums, and alms-houses come. He may escape these and marry; but, his body is not fully developed and his mind incapacitates him for anything but menial labour. Where did all this evil begin? With the ignorance of his parents, and the consequent excessive indulgence of their sensual nature: he was inflamed, even in his mother's womb, with that all-destroying passion. The waste of the vital energies was the cause of the mother's almost constant sickness and rapid decline, and this loathsome condition of her son is due Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS, to the same cause.

In conse-quence of indulgence in these secret vices, she suffers all her life; and dies young. Her hus-band has had no pleasure in the domestic life; for, her mind has been dwarfed: her sex nature destroyed, and the doctor has been in constant attendance.

There are to be found among them, however, many exceptions in this par-ticular. Let us return to the young man or woman. Ask them: \"\\Vhat is the cause of those pimples on your face and swellings on your neck?\" and they answer: \"I inherited scrofula.\" Yes, you inherited a passion that you might have controlled ; but as you did not, you have these results. Another young man appears bright and active; but· is often seen in questionable company, and is ever seeking to gratify an inflamed passion. Look into his face and notice the pores of the skin; they are full of dark specks, or deep, coarse cavities like pin-holes, and his mind is obtuse in regard to everything but the commonest habits of life. Base, secret habits are sure to make their marks upon the face.

The dividing line between the animal mind, coloured, directed and controlled by sexual desire and all that grows out of it, and the proper mentality of man, seeing things as they are without colouring and shading, is found in the fact that man, in his true sphere, controls the generative forces, while the animal is con-trolled by them. It is within the normal ability of the human mind to grasp the most subtile or expand into the sublime; but as long as man submits to the controlling power of sex desire, it will continue to wield its colouring and biasing influence over all his consciousness. Who has not met men, old and young, whose minds were so thoroughly controlled by this monster, that every mirthful thought was disgustingly obscene?

We have said that the sexual powers are intended to serve but two uses, the first and most constant of these is in the renewal of our own vitality: the second and occasional use is-propagation. Every healthy man or woman produces many thousand germs during the year, each of which i!' capable of producing another organism equal to that of the person forming the germ.

This act, even with those most zealous for children, could not properly be repeated oftener than once in eighteen months, which, for the man, would amount to almost a continent life: and it would add much to the woman. Children produced from fully matured and well cultivated germs would be an honour to our race; and child-bearing would become a delight instead of being attended with danger, sickness and pain as it now is. Great care is taken to develop good horses, cattle, sheep, etc., ancl even fruit and vegetables: but no thought is given to the prenatal development of our chil-dren. If men and women had complete con-trol of themselves in these matters, then, the way would be open to begin the culture of our own species ; but, as it is, they constantly yield to impulses, without regard to anything else. The pernicious teachings upon the sub-ject of sex life, given by professed scientists, are wholly responsible for existing conditions. A man in gentlemanly dress, who had been listening to me upon these subjects; speaking in a cultured tone of voice, asked abruptly :. • • Do you mean to say that a person could, if ·he"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL M£THODS, or she wished, stop afJ discharge of the sexual Jife?\" I answered: \"Yes!\" He replied gruffly: \" I don't believe it!\" This man simply gave voice to the belief common in the world, and many reasons exist for these con• victions. Many a man has said to us: \" Why, I cannot control what ta~<es place in my sleep; I know nothing about it until after it is all over.\" Yes, you can. You should first decide in your own mind that under no circumstances whatever will you indulge the sex passion. A complete decision of the mind is the battle hal( won, for anyone; and for many, wholly won, as the derisions of the mind enter into and control the dreant state; some, however, have greater difficulty than others. In order to gain this control,. it is necessar}• in many cases, to charge the mind not to Jet go of the conscious· ness of the body, and so refuse to sleep soundly. Those who find that they must give up their sound sleep for this attainment, need not fear any evil results; for, ~s they become more successful and the body becomes more potent, the need and inclination to sleep soundly will pass away. Those who experience great diffi-culty in overcoming the waste of the seed will find that after they have persevered and suc-~ed in retaining the germs for even ODO Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. 63 whole month, the need of the old-fashioned sleep will pass away; and, moreover, they will observe that notwithstanding they do not seem to sleep at all, they do not feel tired or sleepy; and as they go on, there will awaken within them another consciousness, which becomes active as they close their eyes and forget the body. This consciousness is wholly of the mind ; but, it is a condition of the mind that does not use or exhaust the body; on the con-trary, allows it perfect rest; and while in this state they can perfectly guard and protect themselves from involuntary losses. Some may have to struggle a long time before they can reach this point; to such we would say: it is necessary that you place your mind in the attitude of one who is compelled to sleep in a place of danger, where he must be on the alert all the time. For instance; if you had a quantity of gold and you knew there were thieves who wished to steal it from you, what would be your mental attitude while sleepi.1g?

Your sleeping hours are nature's time for recuperation; that is, replenishing exhausted life ; but, if you re-tain the seed, the exhaust is supplied without sleep; therefore, the necessity for sleep ceases. I personally know of an instance in which a man who was retaining all the seed worked continually, day and night, for months, with only one, or one and one-half hours' rest, daily, which he took lying down upon a lounge, and immediately letting go of the body. His mind continued active while his body laid like a clod for half an hour or more; after which the sex nature would become active (in its office of transmuting the elements of the blood into life), and this would continue, without any volition on his part, for perhaps, half an hour, and then cease. He would then arise and go to his work, much more refreshed than if he had slept twelve hours; for in that case, the body would have felt dull and oppressed; because sleep when it is not needed causes stagnation of the blood. All persons living this life should make it a rule to arise in the morning as soon as they awake, and \\mmediately occupy the mit:ad or Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"J>~Act'tCAL M1!:tHo1>S. body actively; and when far enough on the way to cease sleeping soundly, they should carefully council and experiment upon their feelings, in · order to ascertain how long it is necessary fot them to lie in bed, and thus govern the hours of sleep by their conscious needs ; but, so long as there ate occasional losses, they should persist in not sleeping more than is absolutely necessary for health and vigour. No one can help you, and we have never found one instance ln which help in this direction was obtained by prayer; on the contrary, it has often been remarked to us: \" So surely as l pray for help and protection, lam sure to fail.\" Remember, dear, devotional friends, the written word is \"He that overcometh1\" etc. Now, if God overcame for you, you would not be the over• comer, nor the recipient of the reward which is promised to those who overcome the creative energies within themselves. In regard to this very point we must make some careful discriminations. First of all, we meet the question : what do we meart by over• coming. \\Ve do not mean to kill out all activity or feeling in the sexual organs, because, the purpose of that organ is to generate and trans. mute 1M seed lor tile use ol tlMI body aad tba •"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"66 PRACTICAL METHODS. brain, and for soul food ; therefore, we mean· simply that you get that organ under control of your will. In regard to this matter you can never judge another by yourself; for all diversity of character, nature, etc., is intensified in this organ. It is the spring (fountain of life) from which nature flows unmodified by education or surroundings; therefore, there are no two alike in this respect. Regarding ultimates, these laws and methods apply to all; but no absolute rules can be given as to means for reaching those ultimates. One whose nature is very active1 and who experi· ences much difficulty in getting control, should make every effort to suppress all sexual activity, just as if the effort were to kill it out; another who has activity 1 but no difficulty in pr~ venting waste of the seed, should not suppress a normal action, especially after sleep or quiet rest; for that is nature's time and method for reinvigorating the blood. We hope none will allow a depraved imagination arising from in& flamed and unnatural passion to deceive them· into any kind of abuse.

If you are one, among the many, whose vitality is low because of a weakness which renders you unable to hold the vital fluids (and the loss of these fluids is the source from which arises all lack of vitality ;-many young girls inherit weakness, so that as soon as they begin to generate life, they begin to lose it from this cause alone), then, it is important that you concentrate all your powers in that direction, and that, beginning with the first of these instructions, you follow them up with will and decisiveness. Those who have no conscious• ness of activity of the sex life should, as well as others, guard themselves and make sure that there is no waste. Many delicate ladies, who are entirely unconscious of any sexual activity or waste, can, by the will, take control of that organ, when they will discover that the absence of conscious activity has been occasioned by the continual loss of the seed generated; and as soon as this ceases they will find themselves in possession .of a great power which will tax taeir utmost ability to subjue-ate.

The sexual power is the creative faculty; in it is found the source of all the good and all the evil on the earth ; because it is \" the spring of all human action, the father and mother alike of all the good and evil on the earth ; and through its halo alone can man sense the ineffable essence of the Godhead.\" When it is perfectly normal, and is being used for the health and vitalization of the body, and is held subject to the dominance of the intelligence, then, the body, mind, and soul are in a health-ful, growing condition ; but, if it is allowed to dominate, it causes us to give our life for mere sensual gratification, and yet we are not grati· fied, but are deceived and disappointed, and our life is made a hell of vague imaginings, devoid of all reality; and we even lose the ability to see and understand things as they really are. We know how deceptive the mind is that is under the control of perverted passion; there-fore, we repeat the salient point, to prevent, if possible, falsification of our pesition.

This example, however, will enable you to see that if such marvellous results are attainable, there are gradations of mental capacities trans-cending any that you now possess, and which will be of great use to you in whatever sphere of life you may occupy. For instance, if you have a clear business mind, it will become much clearer, and to a degree transcending the power of others: you will be able to discern the motives of those with whom you deal ; and so you will find yourself posseised of added ability in every department of life. THE LAW GOVERNING, OR THE WAY IN WHICH NATURE, UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF AN INTELLIGENT WILl., CARRIES ON THIS WORK. The first question to be answered is: What attitude of mind is necessary in order to allow oature to do its work without interference? . You should first fully decide, so that there is no longer any doubt or question in your mind, that you will stop all waste of the vital fluids; and, that UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WHATEVER, Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"76 PRACTICAL METHODS; will you allow yourself to enter into the tez relation, or do anything that will cause a waste of the seed : that you will not under any cir-cumstances use the vital forces merely for sense gratification. When these decisions are really made, so that every feeling within you unites therewith, the work is virtually accomplished,-but very few can do this at once. With many of you there will remain for a long time a hidden desire for the sex relation; yet, by persistent effort, never yielding, you can overcome even this; but once to yield is to give it a control-ling influence which is hard to conquer. When the mind is unquestionably fixed, if your nature is ordinarily normal, you will find that there will be but one period in the month when it will not be comparatively easy for you to carry out your purpose. At that time, how-ever, you will find that new feelings awaken within you, which, unless your decision is weU made, will change your mind. Every day after that, there will be a new and increasing force active within.* If you hold the life for fifteen *Those who have enlisted in the work of overcomin&, and who feel the neecl of added information upon the subject, can obtain it by writing to the Esoteric Frater-nity, and enclosiJl& a postaee swap for reply •.

These conditions, how-ever, in some instances come so gradually, that it might take the party a whole year to realize what he has gained, unless he loses the life, after having conserved it for a month or two, when he becomes very vividly conscious of what he has lost, and from the contrast he learns what he had gained.

This fluid will be taken up by the lymphatic glands, and deposited in the blood. At first this will produce a quiet, dreamy feel-ing, unless you are very active, in which case it will simply add to your ability to be and to do that which you wish. After the first successful month, the psychic germ matures one sign earlier, that is, about two and one·half days sooner. This is more easily observed by women than by men, for it will immediately affect the time of their monthly periods, so that they will occur about that much earlier each month ; unless, by a strong will and an active mind they are able to prevent it!t manifestation altogether, which very few can do. Usually this process will continue for twelve months, or rather, moons, then it may locate at the time of the moon's entrance into Aries, Cancer, Libra, or Capricorn; but more frequently in the latter sign, for reasons we will not now explain.

It is readily observed by those who lead the life, that all the work is done by the spontaneity of nature, and the part we have to take in the matter is to stop doing; but it will be found by all that this is the most difficult part of it. The. whole matter can be summed up as follows:-, Put and keep the body in perfect order, and do; not waste the life produced by it; and as surely as the power resides within you to produce other lives, so will it constantly renew and increase your own ; and as the . amount and quality of life decides the quality and capacity of the person, so will these continue to increase in the same ratio.

Why is this? The reason is that while we are potent with life, there is a har• monious interchange and interblending which feeds the body, mind, and soul; and when the life is exhausted, nothing remains but the memory of what has been, and the desire to find it again. This desire is often the cause of excessive indulgence, that vulgar deceiver that robs both husband and wife of health, happi· ness, and mental capacity, and makes Ii(e seem a mockery and a deception ; whereas, the deception is an erroneous idea of laws, a correct knowledge and application of which would make life far more than the dream of youth and courtship. That so-called dream is the real life, and the drugged lethargy of sensual indulgence is a horrible nightmare. \" I saw two spirits shine above the town, Whose marts ten thousand busy mortals throng : One said, With eyes of pity, guing down, ' Behold the dead.' \" Truly, the world living in this drugged, leUUa1 sta'te ia dead to all tftat gertains to , Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. real life ; and men and women go about strug-gling and striving for a phantom that is ever before them, and ever evades their grasp. One of the causes of delight in the virginal association of the sexes, is the interblending of the positive and negative life-elements obtained from the magnetism emanating from each. The blending of these magnetisms creates life. Life is not a material substance, but is a re-fined, subtile, element permeating the whole body. In the generation of offspring the germ is animated by the blending of the life-elements of both parents; but when the life-elements blend throughout the entire body, the pleasure transcends all others that the human organism is capable of feeling. Love is a hunger of the life which produces motion, and guides the emanations to the object loved. This life emanation will go where it is attracted, and will not be appropriated on the way. It will travel thousands of miles by the strength of the mind, and cause itself to be felt by the one to whom it is directed. Love, then, is life in motion; and the variety of qualities of persons is produced by their different chemical compositions. Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. All persons cannot love each other, for there are natural repulsions as well as attractions. Where repulsion exists, it should be obeyed; for it exists by virtue of the same law that a seed of a certain kind attracts certain qualities and repels others, and is thereby enabled to maintain its species; otherwise all plants would mix together and become a shapeless, con-glomerate mass. The same law obtains in the creative prin-ciple, love; herein is a most prolific source of misery resulting from the marriage relation. Men and women marry without knowing whether there is a proper harmony in the life qualities. How often it occurs, that two good, bright persons marry, and all their friends say: \" What a good match that is \" ; but in a year or so, one, perhaps the man, turns out badly ; becomes lazy or vicious; or it may be the wife who degenerates.

Sometimes the life qualities of two good people will produce a poisonous one, which will destroy the body or mind. Volumes could be written on this vital subject, but we only desire to call attention to these evils and propose a remedy. We con-sider it wrong to point out the ills of human life, unless at the same time we show the way to avoid them ; but as we purpose to present a remedy, we must first consider the cause of the difficulty. While men and women may marry without knowing whether their life qualities will har-monize, nevertheless it is possible for them to be cognizant of it. Nature has made a6undant provision for all the needs of her children, and obedience to her laws will establish love, harmony, and happi-ness. The perverted state of the passions, and the ignorance of these subjects, has put up such a high barrier between men and women, that but few can cross it without dire results. The barrier is the formality existing between man and woman, necessitated by the woman having to continually remember her sex, and that she must be careful of her speech and actioD&, lest the man miscbnatrue either and Digitize' 'YGoogle j"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS, 85 make improper advances. This condition has Jed to people marrying when they knew com-paratively little of each other's real nature, and is the cause of much of the misery, result-ing from the erroneous idea, that all there is in marriage is the gratification of the animal propensities. There is something more in love than the majority of this generation realize. Love is free; it cannot be bound by any law except by that of its own great nature ; but sensual acts can and should be bound. The Bible says, \" God is Love,\" also, \" God is Good.\" When human nature is free from the tyrant passion's chains, then love will always be good, because it will always produce beneficial results. It often produces the exact opposite now, because when the barrier is broken down, even in a small degree, young people who are full of life,-love, are blinded to all the effects in their own natures, and cling together.

If men and women were known to be too honourable to wrong another, then a woman could approach the man towards whom she felt attracted, as she would approach a loving brother, and he could receive her as a loved sister; and in the exchange of that manly and womanly sympathy, no sensual passions blind-ing their sensibilities, they would certainly learn if it was a brotherly and sisterly love, or a more sacred love ; and even if they should begin to think it to be true love, when it is not, variety of experience would check their ardour, and suggest carefulness, and by the purity of absolute chastity on the part of both, the intui-tions would instruct the intellect, and thus prevent all mistakes in marriage. There is a love which few have known. It is a love that opens the inner sanctuary of the soul, and when it does, the sunlight of God's great nature shines in and illuminates the mind, setting on fire ('' God is a consuming fire '') the whole nature of the individual, consuming all evil desires and passions, and exalting the individual to a magnificent man or woman.

Let us tum our attention to some of the common experiences of life, to some of th~se to which we have become so accustomed that we have ceased to question their cause, but content our-selves with the thought that it is natural. The reason why young people loYe the plea· sures of the ballroom, is, that the harmony of music and motion calls all the life forces into rythmic action, so that in the touch of the hand between the opposite sexes, there is an inter-change which neutralizes the true hunger of the sex nature, satisfying all its demands, thereby lessening the liability of their falling. The question might be asked by some: would not the intensity of the action of the life forces, pro-duced by dancing and promiscuous magnetic interchange, lead to greater desire for indul-gence of the sex nature? In reply we will say that that would be the case only where the mind and desires were in that direction before they began; but if the desires were for purity of life all real demands would be satisfied without thought of sexual indulgence; in fact, all real demands are satisfied in all cases, the Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"92 PRACTICAL METHODS. products of a sensual desire being left with the base-minded only. It is a well known fact that a person filled with life can dance about a carpeted room, and coming suddenly up to a gas-burner, light it with a touch of the finger. This being true, you will readily see how much of an interchange of sex life there is in a company during an evening's dance. Realizing this fact, is it not enough to make any pure-minded person shudder, to see young, pure blossoms on the dancing-floor with the debauchee, who is, per· haps, filled with loathsome disease? although such a one may be considered a very respectable gentleman, because of wealth and station. According to the law of generation, opposites attract each other, hence the life emanations of the male are attracted by the female, and vice-versa; which is the same law that applies io chemistry. As has already been stated, when two elements combine chemically, another sub-stance is produced. In the chaste association of the sexes, each will readily discriminate between the variety of feelings and mental conditions produced by different persons. It will be observed that one will set the brain in a whirl of uncertainty ancl c:baos ; another will Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHOI>S. 93 have the effect of giving mental clearness and intensity, causing the mind to run on until exhausted ; another will cause physical activity, and so excite the nervous system that it could not long be endured ; and others will excite the passions to activity. Thus, every person will produce effects analagous to their own nature; and all these effects are as varied as the natures of individuals. Associating in purity will furnish opportunities for each to study these effects, and decide which would be most desirable for a life-long companion ; and will overcome all that vague ideal which so often misleads and deceives young people. Chemical analysis reveals the fact that the body is composed of separate elements, and that the different conditions of individuals are caused by different combinations of these elements, which gives full evidence that in so far as the combination of these elements differ, ;so must the individuals differ one from the other. Therefore, we may reasonably argue, that the mind qualities, as well as the life qualities and magnetic emanations, are but the sublimated chemicals of the person ; and if this. is true, then we should consider the relative effect of one person upon another, judrinr from thoir cbemical oompoaition.

All chemists know that there are many mild and useful elements, harmless in themselves, which, if put together, will make the most terrible explosives; others, deadly poisons; while others will not combine, but will continue to repel each other in spite of all efforts to unite them. Men and women marry and combine the elements of their bodies to produce offspring. The query now arises: what will be the result of that chemical combination? \\Ve can find the answer in past experiences by looking around us; but you can form a correct answer when you watch and sense the effect of those interchanges which always take place between men and women in all ordinary association. For two persons to sit near each other is suffi· cient to create this interchange, if they are filled with life; so that when the opportunity is given for harmonious association without that monster sensual desire being present, it is easy to discern correctly what will be the product of a more complete interchange.

The time has come for these things to be understood, and if they are not, the people will rebel against the laws that bind men and women together, thereby demanding experience even to promiscuity, which will produce such a fire of passion, that the reproduction of our race will cease altogether. Not only this, but too intense passion destroys the mind and opens the door to all kinds of excesses, which state of affairs is already rapidly gaining ground in the world. But the thought and habit of chaste associa-tion modifies the passions, and precludes all inclination for those soul-destroying vices, self-abuse, and promiscuous indulgence; in fact, such association would make them impossible.

Woman's nature is more conjugal love than sesual desire ; she wants someone to Jove and caress. That is the only desire of most young women, and in fact of all women. The real ideal in the heart of a young woman is a strong man on whom she can Jean, and into whose keeping she can commit her life, to be con• trolled, guided, and protected; one in whom she can Jive and love continually, and who has manhood enough to control himself and live io harmony with nature's laws. Could she find such a one, she would worship him, and pour through him all the wealth of her mind and soul, thus increasing his power in every direc-tion, and especially supplementing his brain po-.ver t by s·upplying an deficiences.

If man pursues woman and forces himself upon her, she will hate him; but if he is l<ind and gentle, and is careful never to force himself upon her, but always keeps her mind desiring him, she will worship him, and give herself, soul, body, and mind to him; but if h~r ·passions are exhausted, she may respect but .she cannot love him.

The great David of the Bible said: \" Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.\" The seventh commandment says: \" Thou shalt not commit adultery.\" Is it possible to commit adultery? From the ordinary under-. standing of the term, adultery means to adulterate with other qualities than the primate one.

One day the opportunity came, and I asked : \" Before marriage, did you not love a man who had a light complexion?\" She hesitated a moment, but being reassured, answered: \" My aunt raised me, and on coming to womanhood I promised her not to marry anyone who would take me away from her. Subsequently a gentleman came here, from a distant city, on business, and remained some time. We became attached to each other, and he wanted me to marry him, and go with him to his home; but I could not break my promise, so after a time he went home, and I have never seen him since.

Because the image of that man lived in her mind and heart: she loved him. Perhaps Mr. E-surfeited her with his passion, and when she wanted to love and caress him, he would return animal desire, which killed out all possibility of any love that might have been born, if he had been strong enough in his true manhood to control himself and her. There-fore, all her love went out to her first ideal, and, no doubt, was reciprocated in his inner consciousness; and when she allowed the womanly passion to act enough to produce off-spring, her mind held before it the image of the one she really loved. From other experi-ences, we are prepared to say, that her condition in the act that should be most sacred, so fully affected him as to at least, cause him to desire similar relations; and if his body was asleep, it would produce a dream that would make him think that he was really with her. Thus, enough of the vital elements of life were really exchanged between them to give quality to the germ. Mr. E-could furnish the mate-rial, but Mr. -furnished the essential life.

'.(u the power 0f the mind is dependent upon the ability of the individual to concentrate and hold it upon one subject or thought as long as he wishes. Few persons realize what a woeful waste of mental power is constantly going on within them. One seldom meets a person who can control his mind sufficiently to keep it from wandering when he wishes to hold it to one subject or thought. The brain possesses many organs, and those act upon as many subjects as their functions embody. Unless brought under the control of an educated will, they are like an army of men without a captain, each acting in his own peculiar way, and differently from every other one; thus throwing the whole army into chaos, each being in the other's way, if not actually antagonistic.

In our present civilization, reading matter is so abundant, that people are apt to acquire the habit of devouring everything in the shape of literature that comes in their way; spending all their leisure time in reading, merely as a pastime, without any idea of profiting there· from, which fosters the habit of forgetfulness. When talking with persons about reading light, trashy literature, they usually answer: \" Oh, it does not affect me; I don't remember it any longer than the time it takes me to read it.\" That is to say they have drilled them-selves in forgetfulness, and what is worse they have established within themselves the habit of thinking to no purpose; in other words, the habit of abstraction in thought. Such persons can learn nothing, they are mere automatons, machines that run whenever there is the slightest thing to set them in motion, obtaining no benefits, nothing but the wear and tear of the machinery. Just imagine the condition of the mind of a person who reads or hears expressions of a line of thought continually, and retains nothing.

To ask people of such habits to hold their minds on one subject for five minutes, would be useless, for they are incapable of doing so.

This metbtXI of concentrating and holding fixedly to whatever interests you, ·with the thought in mind of methods for accomplishing desired results, will make everything easy to you. By being able to concentrate and hold the mind on a given subject or thought without wavering, powers are attainable transcending the ordinary idea of what is possible. It was well known to most ancients, that as soon as a thought concerning anything, and a know• ledge of where that thing belongs, comes to anyone, by concentrating the mind upon it and holding it there steadfastly, all the knowledge concerning it could and would be obtained. By carefully considering and applying these truths, you will be able to think, and also to form the habit of thinking from your own volition; to think when you wish to think, and you will also know how to stop when you wish to. This, by the way is just as essential in tome instances as to know how to think. Many persons have destroyed themselves tbtoU&h inability to stop thinking."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"118 l>RACTICAL METHODS. It must be borne in mind that it takes U much vitality to think as it does to do physical labour. It is, therefore, just as essential to be able to rest from thought, when one wishes to do so, as it is to be able to stop work when one is tired. Study the methods by which you begin and carry on the process of thinking ; also the methods by which you can stop. Observe the difference between the thoughts of a concen-trated mind, and those that arise from the feelings. For instance, after you have been thinking intensely for some time, tum your mind away quickly from the thought you have been holding, and take some recreation. Tum the mind to something mirthful, but as you do so, observe the changes in your feelings and mentality. See if you can in the midst of your mirthfulness change instantaneously to a con• dition of thoughtfulness, and then back again to mirthfulness: observing carefuUy the pro-cess by which this is done ; and this will open the door more quickly and directly to self· knowledge than anything else that you can do. We would advise that you not only observe the method by which you think or stop think· ing, but also observe carefully every sensation, Digitize' 'YGoogle __ j"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. 119 feeling and emotion of the body, searching carefully to find the cause. Examine closely and see if you cannot discover the thought that produces the sen5atinn or emotion ; also the thought that will change or stop it. Herein will be found the keys to perpetual health; for the mind originally created the body, and the educated mind is capable of perpetuating it. After ascertaining the thought that produces a sensation, and the method by which you c;an change or stop it, you will finally be able to determine the cause of diseases by the changes of thought and feeling. True it is, as one of the ancients said : \" Man only begins to live when he begins to think,\" for, until then he is but ar. animal. As we stated in a former chapter, all pleasures arising in the senses, unguided by the educated mind according to the law of use, will inevitably bring pain; but all pleasures arising in an orderly mind, are like those of the angels, bringing lastine-profit and pleasure. By applying the methods we have given for conquering the controlling power of habit in everything, even. to the generative principle, and by the retention of the life forces generated in the body, the capacity of the mind and the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"120 PRACTICAL t.IRTHODS. body will be increased, intensified, and ilium· inated; so that the most ordinary person applying these instructions will become trans-cendently superior to the most highly organized person not doing so ; and will be en a bled to see that life has an object worth living for. THE NEW MEliiORV. The reason we say new mttllbi'J is, because the old memory which has characterized the world in the past, is the same that is manifest in the animal kingdom, and which is wholly a thing of the senses; being limited by the vividness of impression made upon the con· sciousness, and is governed either by -fear or desire, which are the prompters of attention. Man has now risen above the point of being controlled wholly by the :11\\imal passions and desires, and in so far as he has, he finds that his memory is deficient. Again, all persons at the present time are driven by the force of circumstances, with a rapidity far in excess of anything in the past; so much so indeed, that persons in the ordinary spheres of usefulness now, have as many things to retain in their memory and 'give attention to in one day, as our ancestors of a hundred years a&o ba'd in • week. ..tlf Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. 121 The keenest and most practical business minds have intuitively discovered the new memory process, which is based on the order and relation of one thing to another; for it has been found that in any business where there is a great variety of things to attend to, it is necessary to have everything in perfect order ; otherwise many things would be overlooked. The processes that we have given you in former lessons for strengthening the mind and increas· ing its capacity, lays a substantial foundation for this new memory process, which is based entirely upon the law of order. Order is the great factor in all nature: every plant and animal and even the universal mind is distinguished and diversified by this law ; for instance, if we plant a kernel of com in the ground, from the time it sprouts until it fully matures, its form expresses its inherent quality, thereby distineuishing it from all other plants. The human mind has become accustomed to distinguishing the quality and nature of all things by the form. This has been carried to great extremes, so that if we look into the face of a man or woman, the form, colour, and even the differing changes of expression are recog· aized, and the disposition producing them Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"12t PRACTICAL r.unttODS. defined. Were it not for this undeviating law of order in nature, such things would be impos-sible. As this is the principle in nature with which we have become most familiar, it has become the strongest faculty of the human mind; consequently with a little observation of its character and methods of action, and by careful culture, it can be developed to a mar-vellous extent. As we lay the foundation for memory, we necessarily lay the foundation for the develop-ment of powers that heretofore have been associated with the marvellous or magical. The old maxim: \"A place for everything, and everything in its place,\" is applicable here as a foundation for making a clear mind and a retentive memory. But it must be carried beyond the merely material things that we are handling and have . about us ; it must have special relation to the mental process. Wha~ ever sphere of life you now occupy, or expect to occupy, study to know all about it in every particular, classifying every branch, so that everything relating to it will be like a picture, the image of which can be drawn up before the mind's eye at any time, and all the parts be distinctly seen in the imagination, even to the smallest minutia.

If the pictures become numerous, to facilitate the process of calling up the image of the oile you want, you can make one central figure, with all the others merely branches of that one, and arrange them all around it in permanent order ; then all you will need to remember is the order in which they are arranged. Your mental vision can instantly perceive the one that you wish to call up, and as soon asthatiadone, the mind will quickly grasp all the minor points pertaining to it, and the thing that you wish to recall will be before the mind's eye as soon a.a you think of tbe image. These memory pictures will involuntarily unite with the central one we have just referred to. This central picture will be like a person's home: it will express the real character of the person and his business quall· fications, and will be in fact, a picture of the sphere of life for which he is beat adapted.

Having established the method of associating everything that you know, and every new idea that you have obtained, with one of these pictures, then you will have arranged your mental faculties in an orderly condition for RECOLLECTION. (RE-cOLLECTION.) The word, recollection, carries with it the idea of recalling to mind past events. The collection of thoughts is the ordinary mental action, and the recollection of thoughts is the process of ca11ing them back after they have gone out, and is the method of memory. The word, memory, has a different meaning. To remember a thing or occurrence, first, recall it (call back) to the mental consciousness: then you rememtier the picture; that is, you put member to member in its order as it occurred. Thus you perceive that the process of mentality is the calling in of thoughts, or creating them and putting them together in an orderly structure, which is in an image, ao imagination ; that is, an image made of some-thing new that you are thinking about, or Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"hACTICAL METHODS. 126 something that has already occurred.

While this is true, yet to those who want to reach the highest goal of human attainment, these methods are equally essential, because they are methods leading to compliance with nature's laws, and therefore Divine laws. llany who follow these instructions to ulti· mates without being fully and firmly decided that they desire them exclusively for material attainments, will have an experience which may come through a vision, a vivid dream, or an external experience, in which it will be shown them by the Spirit that they have reached a point where it is necessary for them to decide, to choose between obtaining wealth, honour, and position in this world, or being poor, de-spised of men, but obtaining the true honour and riches of a spiritual life. It has been under-stood, since the teachings of the Lord's Christ, Digitize' 'YGoogle"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL METHODS. 127 that the two cannot go together. It was said of Him : \" He is despised and rejected of men ; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were, our faces from Him; He was despised and we esteemed Him not. \" Christ himself said: \" How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God?\" ' You who would enter the kingdom of heaven, and be one with the Spirit of God; who feel that you are done with the things of this world, may choose the highest goal of attainment; but remember, with it comes poverty in the things of this world, and dishonour among men. You who feel that you would like to bring up a nice family, and have at your command the wealth of this world, and a high position among men may do so; but you must remember that the choice that you make at this time is for the balance of your physical life in this incarnation. Therefore, do not pass this matter over lightly, because it is the most important decision that can be brought for the consideration of anyone.
