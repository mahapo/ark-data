In order that we may determine how soon you will be ready for LIBER—(QADOSCH) which deals with the SUBSTANCE of an OPUS, and constitutes the third part of the definition of the second PASS-WORD of the ZELATOR, study and apply the following rules which refer to the TECHNIC of making and recording an OPUS. 2. Regard all your acts of sexual intercourse as scientific experiments and record them in every detail in your Record. 3. It is not necessary or advisable that your partner be informed of the scientific nature, unless some problem arises which cannot be solved unless you do, in which case first write to your Immediate Superior for permission & advice. 4. Starting with the first operation performed after receiving this page, number them as follows in Roman numerals; OPUS I, OPUS II, OPUS III, OPUS IV, etc. 5. Enter the time when you begin & end the act. Describe fully & exactly the whole experience in all its physical & mental aspects & make any remarks which are the fruit of scientific study & observation of the OPUS. Your entry will answer such questions as (1) with whom? Here you may use initials or a code name if you prefer. (2) How long did the preliminaries last before intromission? (3) how long after intromission? (4) did either party or both have an orgasm? (5) what satisfaction was derived by both parties? (6) what if any accessory performances either during or afterwards? (7) what were the immediate results, feelings, attitude, mental & physical, engendered by the act? (8) what was the object of the act? 6. Send in a sample of one of your entries so that we may judge both if you are making the entry & the opus properly. 7. Do not imagine, just because you receive instruction on sex, that sex has necessarily anything to do with the Great Work. It is quite possible to initiate a person who has no sexual relations whatever! It is also possible to initiate a dummy! Many misguided occultists have confused sex with occultism to such an extent that they have become sexual maniacs. Members of the G.’.B.’.G.’. are enlightened & thus protected from this danger."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Zelator 2=9 "}]
