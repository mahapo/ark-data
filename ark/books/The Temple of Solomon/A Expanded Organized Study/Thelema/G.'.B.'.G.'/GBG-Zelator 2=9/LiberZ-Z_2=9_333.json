In personal contact with a stranger whom you may have reason to suppose is a Member; while shaking hands look at the ears. If the other person then shakes the head ask, “Why do you shake your head?” The proper reply is “Because I am not a Troglodyte.” Then you may test with the word which is the greeting. (This procedure refers to the asininity and general stupidity of Troglodytes per se.) 0 0. In correspondence a Neophyte is discovered by the three dots. You can discover a Zelator as follows. Place a straight line horizontally under the third letter of your surname when you sign a letter to the person you are testing. The proper reply is the same. Next time you write, put the Greek initial of the first PASS-WORD, in place of the line. The proper reply is the Greek initial of the second PASS-WORD. Then you are permitted to use the formula of communication revealed in the next section, possession of which is prima facie evidence of possession of the Grade of Zelator. 0. Always observe the following rules when writing to Members of the Grade of ZELATOR and higher, but not below. Date your letter with the day of the month first, then the month, then the year followed by the letters “e.v.” (era vulgaris—the common mode of reckoning). Salute your correspondent as “Care” (Dear) Soror (Sister) or Frater (Brother) and his or her magical name as soon as you learn it. Next place the numeration of the greeting; never write PASS-WORDS themselves. After the body of your letter close with the numeration of the second PASS-WORD, and sign yourself “Yours fraternally” or “sororially” with your MAGICAL NAME, with a line under it drawn through the three dots, and below the line the number of your Name. In the lower left-hand corner of the page put your regular initials separated from the initial of your MAGICAL NAME by a line, thus: “CFR/G”, and under this the exact hour and minute when you are writing the time when you finish the letter.

"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" LIBER Z-Z 1. Before any oral or written communication with a stranger as a preliminary always discover whether or not he or she is a Member of your own Grade and in good standing. Never use the formula of communication of any Grade below that Grade. Should any person communicate with you at any time who appears to know only a part of the formula of communication for the Grade he or she presumes to have, be careful and advise Headquarters. 2. Never discuss any information received under our Seal with any other Member before ascertaining that the other person has received the same information or its equivalent. No two Members of any Grade need necessarily be in possession of the same information at the same rate. You may learn how far the other person has advanced by direct questions referring to an official paper of the Grade which you are certain he or she has by name and edition and section. The number of the edition is usually placed in the upper right-hand corner of the paper and in parentheses. Contents are referred to as Libri, but except in the case of women are usually given in the form of Official Orders. As soon as you learn to write in the Secret Script you may discover what another person knows by formulating your interrogations in this silent speech. 3. Very little of what you have learned and will learn from us is known to Troglodytes; that little has already been garbled by the appointed Guardians so as to be misconstrued. You are cautioned never to so speak or write that an outsider could learn the secrets you are discussing. 4. You are put in touch with other Members not as an end but as a means to aid your accomplishment of the GREAT WORK. Hence, although you do not, of course, preface your correspondence and conversation with a description of the GREAT WORK and the OATH-OF-TRUTH which always constitute your first entries in all your Records, yet remember these. 5. Sometimes a Member of your hierarchy fails to get some particular document at all when there is no special need or else some special reason; but wherever no particular objection exists you may obtain said papers for the inferior by advising us. 6. You should have burned page zero of this Book, but preserve this page (one). Z-Z refers to the TECHNIC of Communication. The SUBSTANCE thereof is dealt with is Liber S-S (Silence & Speech; also Secret Script). Your first instruction in the mystery of language is contained in Liber B, which will be communicated the moment you give the true sign of being ready for it. "}]
