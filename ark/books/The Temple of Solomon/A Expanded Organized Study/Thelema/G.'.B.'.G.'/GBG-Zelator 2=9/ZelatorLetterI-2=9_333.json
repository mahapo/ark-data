[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"1 ZELATOR 2=9 0. You were passed to the Grade of ZELATOR at ____________________e.v. Your MAGICAL RECORD has been examined and approved. Study carefully the comment. The Grade of ZELATOR is primarily one of Service. You must now, if you have not already begun to do so, accept applicants and begin the formulation of your own Magical Hierarchy, for you cannot pass beyond this Grade until you bring one of your own Probationers through the Grade of Neophyte up to the Grade of Zelator, so that someone will be fitted to take your place as you go on and up. No attainment soever, beyond that which you now have, is officially recognized by the .’.ORDER unless your immediate inferior has been prepared by you under our guidance to assume the Grade from which you are promoted. The one habit essential to Membership in the .’.ORDER is that you regard all your attainments as primarily the property of those less advanced aspirants than yourself who are confided to your charge. Their failure is your own failure. You must become inspired with the purpose of becoming Initiated so as to help confer Initiation upon others. Every act which helps another attain breeds within your own soul a power which hastens your own attainment. 1. To hold a high position within the .’.ORDER it is very necessary that you do not withdraw from the world, but rather observe the Rosicrucian rule of acting as a sophisticated person of the world. All Troglodytes are analogous to little children. You shall become fully adult in the deepest sense of the term. Initiation is all that you have ever conceived, and more, but it does not conform to the categories and terms of your expectation. No matter what you receive or experience during Enlightenment, never under any circumstances abandon the sound dictates of common sense that you have learned in the physical world, although you will learn a higher logic that applies to the super-physical. Extreme danger to yourself and those bound to you will arise if you presume to run or fly before you have acquired the ability to stand upright and walk. Remember that you were already an Initiate of a certain Grade in previous incarnations. Do not allow the return now of any knowledge or power hitherto earned to hinder your subsequent progress. 2. Your first duty as a ZELATOR is to choose a motto consisting of one word—in any language—to stand for your own private conception of the GREAT WORK—to be used as your MAGICAL NAME as a Member of the G.’.B.’.G.’.. As soon as you have definitely decided on this Name, which shall portray both secretly and openly the exact manner in which you are to serve the .’.ORDER as a MAN (or WOMAN)-OF-EARTH, send it to us and your secret number will be revealed to you. You are not permitted to change this Name before you experience the first CRISIS."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 ZELATOR 2=9 3. Prepare a separate blank-book, with BLACK COVERS, always in the manner prescribed, i.e. your first entry is the description of the GREAT WORK, and your second is the OATH-OF-TRUTH. All your Records from now on shall contain your new Name on the inside front cover, and your entries will be dated in the same way that you date your letters as a Zelator. In this book record all your results pertaining to the various things you may be commissioned to do on the road to the accomplishment of the GREAT WORK. Let your remarks be brief, accurate, and scientific. Over your Magical Name in this book place the word LIBER. 4. Prepare another Record in the same way, except that you label it Vol. II instead of Liber (Your Magical Name). This will be the second volume of your MAGICAL RECORD. (You may use the remainder of the first volume which is being returned if there is any room left.) In it you will continue to make one entry each night just as you did while a Neophyte until further notice. You will not, however, repeat any mistakes which have been called to your attention. You will strive to preserve strict unity, bring your desire to a point, avoid indefiniteness and lack of precise concrete details and links, and comply with any other instruction which is given you. You will give exact expression and utterance to your Will. As soon as you have proved that your entries are technically perfect you will be expected to keep the secret of your object also from us. Send an exact copy, including the dating, of the whole of your seventh entry to your immediate superior. In this work you are taking the first steps to bring full, human, self-consciousness the Power which resides in the Volition, which is an independent entity and must be separated from its entangling alliance with the entities which reside respectively in the Feelings and Thoughts. The PANTACLE is your destiny; your entries are all similar or different views of your destiny. In taking the responsibility for your destiny in your own hands you begin to make and master the weapon of the SPHINX known as the WAND. You will attain to real FREEDOM the more you create a destiny which is quite different, unique, original, possible, and desirable only to yourself. Aim to be and do something which no one else has ever been or done, or imagined. In so far as your impulses to act, feel, and think do spring from within, you will transcend the necessity of being guided and directed by higher powers and the laws of a nature external to you; you will incorporate and awaken these higher forces within your own being and become a law unto yourself. Let events only, not words, reveal to outsiders your decrees. You must be very careful to observe utter silence concerning your desire and aim everywhere except in your entry; there you must be explicit and reveal perfectly what is your will. 5. Prepare a third book and Label it Liber O (Oneiron), and record therein every dream you have. Use clear language and manage the expression so that not only yourself but anyone else can see exactly what you mean and the precise details of what happened. Distinguish carefully between the dream itself and all sorts of fancies suggested while you are recalling it. The consciousness of dreaming is termed ASTRAL, that of every-day wide-awake life is termed PHYSICAL. Your life in the physical world has caused you to connect different sensations, ideas, feelings, volitions, etc. and taught you a certain behavior"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3 ZELATOR 2=9 whose opposite is contrary to physical interests. But the laws of the astral world are quite different to those of the physical. When you enter the dream world you are present in a sphere where the laws of physical nature and behavior no longer prevail. Therefore, to avoid bewilderment, you absolutely must not take your physical logic with you; you must forget the laws and connections of physical consciousness while you are in the astral world. But when you wake up again you must remember and NEVER forget the experiences and logic you have learned while asleep. The moment you lose physical consciousness and fall asleep the world you have known splits up into three different worlds. Physical logic is incapable of harmonizing these three; you must learn the super-physical laws which connect them and make them into a unity. When you return you will remember and apply this super-mundane logic towards improving your life in the physical world. The harder your bed the easier you will remember your dreams. You can, if convenient, put boards under your mattress. Also if you will put all the qualities, such as detail, clarity, and fidelity, into your descriptions of the events of physical consciousness, when conversing and writing, you will cause the same to emerge in the recollection of your dreams. Continue Liber O until further notice. Send us a copy of the seventh entry. 6. In order to establish contact with the beings who manifest in your dreams perform the following exercise which will develop clairscient powers. Just after awakening, remain quiet and meditate thus: attach your attention persistently to any part of the dream which presents itself. Hold the experience and say to yourself: “I am watching this phenomenon and keeping my mind fixed upon it, so that it shall reveal to me what it really is.” Do not under any circumstances allow yourselves to stop thinking or to stop thinking thoughts which directly relate to what you are watching, which is immediately present in consciousness. The beings who manifest in the figures of the dream are not at all what physical consciousness imagines them to be. By your own inner activity a light is shed upon the event while you regard it and think about it, which shall reveal the real attributes of what you regard. 7. The .’.ORDER consists of twelve Grades of degrees, represented by equations; composing three groups or Colleges of which the outer is known as the G.’.B.’.G.’. and consists of five Grades. When you have experienced the first CRISIS, and successfully passed the ORDEAL-X, you enter the middle or inner Group of Grades known as the COLLEGIUM AD SPIRITUM SANCTUM, and to initiates throughout the world as the genuine R.’.C.’. Fraternity, which is also the custodian of the true secrets of all Rites of Masonry. As a Zelator you will begin to study the formula of the ROSY CROSS. "}]
