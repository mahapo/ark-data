[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" LIBER-B 0. This Book B (named from Beth, the House of the Juggler) is written in the SECRET SCRIPT & constitutes your first instruction therein. Never under any circumstances communicate its content except in the Secret Script & then only to your own Immediate Inferiors when, but not before, they manifest in their MAGICAL ENTRIES, the Sign which calls for this Liber. I. The SIGN which enables us to give you this Book is to be found in your Entries, those parts only, which are marked with a capital B. When commenting on the Entries of your I.I. indicate by a capital B made with a pencil so that it can be erased if you are wrong the part or parts which you consider worthy of this Book. Then if we approve of your judgment by going over your letter B with ink, then, but not otherwise, communicate the content of this Book to the Candidate, orally unless we furnish you with this document for your I.I. II. This Book concerns the SUBSTANCE, in contradistinction to the TECHNIC of MAGICAL ENTRIES. You are permitted & expected to comment on the TECHNIC of your I.I., always signing your comments with your own MAGICAL NAME & NUMBER, but you must never under any circumstances comment on the SUBSTANCE of their Entries, except by communicating the content of this Liber when it is called-for & your mark of that fact is confirmed by Headquarters. Instructions on the SUBSTANCE of the Work are always written in the Secret Script, complete explanation of which is given in Liber S-S. III. Write out a comment on this Liber B in the form of a letter to your own I.S. but in such a way as to show that you understand the Secret herein divulged but NOT in such a way as to reveal that Secret to anyone who does not already know it, i.e., explain why we have given you this Liber & how you propose to apply it in your Magical Entries. XVII. Deliver your comment on this Book to your I.S. who will forward it to Headquarters, without delay. "}]
