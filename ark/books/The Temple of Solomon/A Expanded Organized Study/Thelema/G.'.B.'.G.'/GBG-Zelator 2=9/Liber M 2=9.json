No Troglodyte has ever had any truthful conception of the nature of God or the Origin of the Species, the secret doctrine of which is revealed to Members of the .’.ORDER. 1. The word “god” itself is derived from GUTHAN, the Pourer, who is Aquarius, the HOLY SPIRIT, who confers the Power of Growth, and merely the Third Person of the Trinity. Synonymous names referring to the same Person and functions are: Zeus, Dios, Deos, Gheist, Bof, Fiorgynor and Ve. The three dots used in a certain place by the Neophyte, and in another place by the Zelator, stand for the Divine Trinity, whose manifestation is as the three Fates or Norns; KLOTHO, LACHESIS, and ATROPOS, in the Greek and VERDANDE, URD, and SKULD in the Teutonic. Their functions are respectively that of FATHER, MOTHER, and HOLY SPIRIT. Other manifestations of the Trinity shall be disclosed later. 2. ADAM, the ancestor of part of the human race, is the highest of the Mammals, but not the most intelligent of the animals. The race of ADAM has the most important function at the time when all the off-spring of EARTH undergo the APOTHEOSIS. ADAM was not created in the image of God, but is that animal created as the image of the “Likeness of the Powers” (Dnuth Aelouheeim), that human soul to whom first of all creatures occurs the APOTHEOSIS. To Him the second Person of the Trinity was united at the beginning of Creation. He is that “Ancient of Days” to which the divine Norn or Fate, LACHYSIS, URD, MATHRA, WEIRD, WORD is united; He is therefore the Judge, FORSETI, ODIN; yet He is a creature, although he exercises the whole Powers of the EARTH. The union between His soul and that of the Second Person of the Trinity is intimate & profound, but it depends wholly upon his will & character that it should continue. In the course of time when He appears on EARTH to be born as the descendant of the man whose body was created for that purpose, He is man only, possessed of little more than human power, & subject to the vicissitudes of human life. Hence He can be tempted, threatened, terrified, tortured & killed. But after this probation is over, & no force has been able to impair the perfect uprightness of His nature, the human soul of the World-Hero is then perpetually united to the Second Person of the Trinity & He thereby becomes a divine being. The only object for which man was created was that by the incarnation of URD, MATHRA SPENTA, the feminine personality of the Supreme Being, all the ancient Spirits, the ULTIMATE PARTICLES, & all the plants & animals descended from the original FATHER & MOTHER, may be released from the vanity of their corporeal forms & become equal to the INFINITE, Who will admit none but equals to His society. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"ZELATOR 2=9       2 3. Before the parents of the White Race were driven from the Garden of Eden, at the time of the first injury to the World-Will in the days of JACK & JILL, the sex functions were united in one body which was androgynous. After the Judgment in Genesis, termed the Flood of Gyges (not the Flood of the time of Noah), further variations in species became impossible because differentiation of the sexes fixed each species at its own respective rank; the psychic impulse became divided and could no longer work coordinately in both of the reproductive functions. Hitherto an offspring was produced suited to the wish of the Parent, and possessing whatever powers the Parent had attained at the time of conception, by hypnotizing the form (Ruach) of the germ cell to a given similitude at the instant of conception. The form (Ruach) is the Power which maintains the cycle of vital reactions in the chemical elements constituting the body, so that the seed always develops & grows into the likeness of its species. Previous to the Fall, the Ruach Elohim (Breather of the Powers), the manifestation of the HOLY GHOST, dominated the psychic impulse received from the Parent. The Fall was caused by ADAM-and-EVE eating of a certain Geoplasmic substance which grows on the TREE-OF-ALL-SEEDS, the Tree of Knowledge of Good (perfect things) & Evil (imperfect things). This Fruit is the “pail of water” which JACK & JILL went up the HILL to fetch. EVE was tempted by the Sorcerer or Whisperer (NoHHoSH), the original possessor of the “Evil-Eye”, the “All-Seeing-Eye”, the “Unpaired-Eye”, who is the DEVIL, the manifestation of the Third Person of the Trinity in the organic or “breathing” world. Eating of the “Fruit” produced an over-stimulation of the latent possibilities of structural growth which are under the control of the one living ion which dominates, hypnotizes & rules over the group or family which composes the atom. The souls of plants & animals have all existed since creation & have come up from the lowest & simplest mode of being. The HOLY SPIRIT confers on the ancient Spirits the power to form bodies, & gives to each the power to be exactly what it wishes to be, so that the dignity attained, whether that of man or grasshopper is a consequence of the ionic life of the individual (the doctrine of Karma). Protoplasm, although of complex chemical composition, is yet an irreducibly simply vital substance which can maintain continuous chemical reactions & manifest irritability & voluntary movement. The power present in all living protoplasm is the soul (forma substantialis) and gives one common character to the diverse elements of the chemical group so that the whole appears as one simple, single, structureless substance. One identical nature rules in it, the nature of the irreducible simple individual ion which alone possesses the power which it communicates to the mass of maintaining a continuous series of chemical reactions. 4. The DEVIL wars against APOTHEOSIS, the formula of perfection, & seeks through use of His vast hypnotic power through which by suggestion He can act on all minds, exercising his influence at particular moments, to produce in mankind that moral perversion which shall make it impossible for the divine nature to be communicated & brought to full self-consciousness through humanity (the feminine nature) to all creatures. The word, GHaRVooMeeIM, which has been mistranslated “naked” has originally the same meaning as the word, GHoRVooM, which refers to Clairvoyance—Initiated Intelligence. Those who are GHaRVouMeeIM are all-knowers, serpents, Cyclops, omniscient, like the Trinity. But the natural human body was incapable of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"ZELATOR 2=9       3 wielding this Power; hence the race-parents became demented by the change suddenly in their natures brought about by eating of the forbidden fruit & were imbeciles for fifty years thereafter; & rendered totally physically impotent for a long time, & were never afterwards able to reproduce their original species. They were in the first horrors of dementia when they concealed themselves as told in Genesis, & gave their answer to the questions of IeVeH AeLouHeeIM, Jehovah of the Powers. 5. The Candidate learns to grasp the law involved in the origin of species, & combines it with knowledge that he or she is still an androgynous being, in more ways than one. The danger to one who manipulates the forces placed at one’s disposal before being fully prepared to handle them or worthy to use them, lies in the fact that the moral character of the act which arouses KUNDALINI is inevitably communicated to it and forever afterwards rules over the structural growth of the offspring. If the Initiate does not dedicate himself or herself utterly to the service of humanity it is not possible to escape becoming a BLACK BROTHER, a Parasite on the Universe, & eventually (after eight, eighty, or four-hundred & eighteen years) shall have to take his rightful place in Hell, along with the infernal monsters spawned by the Devil with the aid of his Daughter, (like ADAM, the Devil gave birth to His own Wife), the “worms that die not”, whose bodies are made not of flesh & blood, but of the feces which has passed through innumerable bodies before it reaches those at the bottom of the PIT, where it falls as a fuming acid into the Lake-of-Fire-and-Brimstone, which forms over the roots of the TREE-OF-LIFE, & which will--- (To be continued) 6. The form of humanity expresses thematically all the impulses and instincts of the universe. Protoplasm is itself a microcosm, and miniature cosmos. Mankind is built in harmony with the Second Person of the Trinity; you must learn to regard yourself as a vehicle, an instrument, your individual destiny is a cosmic affair. Your duty is to bring APOTHEOSIS to all the beings & entities associated both in your personal and your magical hierarchy. Power in Magick will come to you in direct ratio to your success in the annihilation of the sense of separateness. 7. Remember that by performing perfectly your own task you make it so much easier for your own pupils, who are sometimes excused from a portion of a task which you have done well. You will thus in a manner be able to check-up on your own progress by comparing your own task with that which is delegated to your inferiors. 8. First in order of time & first in order of importance is that Useful Work which produces MAN, technically termed SERVICE. The true Nobility, the real Lords and Masters of Man, the THELEMITES, are those who administer the functions which SERVE by making others do what they really want to do. Just as the inherent force of one ULTIMATE PARTICLE of substance operates in the body of an animal or plant to produce the form of symmetry by which it expresses itself & multiplies its powers, employing for a time a countless multitude of similar ULTIMATE PARTICLES of matter upon which it expresses its will & purpose—so the law of association in Useful Work produces similar proliferations of the group units. In every living body the individual"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ZELATOR 2=9       4 caprice of the units or structure are subordinated to the purpose which animates the body or organ; if that were not so the body would not be ALIVE. 9. The real HEROES, the THELEMITES, are those who can command the enthusiastic obedience of others because they lie awake at nights when others are asleep or thoughtless, planning to do for those others what those are unable or too careless to do for themselves, and which is the very thing they know they want done. Your Magical Being is the scene of the Mystery of PAN. Love is the Law, Love under Will. There is the dove, and there is the serpent. Choose ye well!"}]
