To face in the direction of the KIBLAH is to face in the direction of the House of your I.S. In all ceremonies your altar or table where you keep the instructions received from us shall be placed in your room (or Temple) so that when you face it you are facing the direction of the KIBLAH. THE GESTURE OF THE KIBLAH. During all ceremonies, each time in your circumambulation you pass this point of the compass, always turn & face the KIBLAH & then (1) make the SIGN OF HOOR-PAAR-KRAAT, while inhaling, then (2) turn again to the direction you were traveling & make the SIGN OF HORUS in your Path. This combination of gestures picks up the Force radiating from Headquarters which is passed on to you from your I.S. & projects it again directly into the Path of your WORKING. Never neglect this Gesture! I. THE BATTERY. A series of knocks or claps (sharp sounds). A certain magical number, say eleven, may be given, or perhaps it will be divided into sections, thus 1-3-3-3-1, in which case, strike once, pause, then strike thrice rapidly in succession, pause, repeat the triple knock, pause, repeat again, pause, strike once. II. THE WAND. Made with either hand as directed by putting the Thumb between the index and medius. Then use the Thumb, thus placed, to trace the figures. III. THE SIGN OF HORUS (also called THE SIGN OF THE ENTERER). Stand erect & as you inhale, imagine that a force (of a prescribed attribution & color) descends slowly to the lungs, heart, solar plexus, navel, to the generative organs. At the same time bring the hands up to the temples at the level of the eyes. The moment the breath appears to reach the Muladhara, let it rush up through the body to the Ajna, then advance quickly the left foot, throw forward the body & fling forth the force with the hands, palms downwards unless otherwise specified, straight out horizontally before you as far as you can reach, keeping them together, unless otherwise specified, thus projecting your Will. IV. THE SIGN OF HOOR-PAAR-KRAAT (Harpocrates), also called the SIGN OF SILENCE. The opposite in effect of (III) & is used to pick up or absorb a force generated either by yourself or someone else. Place or retire the right hand, with the WAND, to your lips, letting the left drop to your side, drawing in the breath & assuming an intense feeling of attention, alertness, listening, watching, vigilance; then relax.

These are traced in the air just as you would make them on paper, by making a continuous or unicursal line from the starting-point, following straight lines from point to point of the figure until you return to the origin. The PENTAGRAM is a five-pointed Star, made of five straight lines. Each point is attributed to one of the ELEMENTS, thus: In order to invoke trace the figure from point to point DEOSIL (i.e., dextro-rotary, as the hands of a clock move, to the right.), starting at the point attributed to the Force you wish to invoke. To banish, start at the same point, but trace WIDDERSHINS, (i.e. in contrary direction, to the left, as the Earth rotates.) To escape confusion when drawing any figure, remember that when INVOKING you start off with the leg to the right of the angle as viewed from the center of the figure. VI. THE HEXAGRAMS. These are also either Upright or Averse & may be used either to Banish or Invoke, The figure is made of six straight lines drawn continuously from start to finish & is NOT made, as sometimes taught, by making two triangles upright & averse interlacing. The points are: When a pentagram is drawn within the Hexagram the whole figure is called the MARK OF THE MAGUS. To invoke or banish the force of SOL make the Hexagram six times, starting each time from a different point. The Averse is simply the Upright turned upside down but in the same plane, two-dimensional (Astral). VII. THE SIGN OF THE ROSY.’.CROSS.’. Trace with the WAND a Cross & then a Circle on the Cross. (1) Draw the vertical line from top to bottom (2) the horizontal from left to right (3) the circle DEOSIL (4) finish by moving the Thumb to the center & then fling it erect with a backward motion of the wrist. CAVEAT! Thus:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Philosophus 4=7       G.B.G. 3 VIII. THE SIGNS OF THE GRADES. NEOPHYTE.

(The Goddess Thoum-aesh-neith) Raise the arms above the head & join the hands, so the tips of the fingers & thumbs meet formulating the triangle of Fire, apex up. DOMINUS LIMINIS. THE SIGNS OF THE PORTAL. ACTIVE. (The Rending of the Veil) Extend the hands in front, palms outwards, separate them as if in the act of rending asunder a veil or curtain. PASSIVE. (The Closing of the Veil) Bring the hands together as if closing it up & let them fall to the sides. IX. THE L.V.X. SIGNS. (1) OSIRIS SLAIN. Extend the arms in the form of a Tau, so that you stand in the shape of a cross. (2) THE MOURNING OF ISIS. Raise the right arm to point upwards, keeping the elbow square & lower the left arm to point downwards elbow square, while turning the head over the left shoulder looking down so the eyes follow the left forearm. (3) APOPHIS & TYPHON. Raise the arms at an angle of sixty degrees to each other above the head, which is thrown back. (4) OSIRIS RISEN. Cross the arms on the breast & bow the head. (5) Repeat (1) & (4) saying: “L.V.X., Lux, the Light of the Cross.” X. The N.O.X. SIGNS. PUELLA. Stand with feet together, head bowed, left hand shielding breast (attitude of the Venus de Medici). PUER. Stand with feet together, head erect. Let the right hand (the thumb extended at right angles to fingers) be raised,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Philosophus 4=7       G.B.G. 4 forearm vertical at a right angle with the upper arm, which is horizontally extended in the line joining the shoulders. Let the left hand, thumb extended forwards & fingers clenched, rest at the junction of the thighs (Attitude of the gods, Mentu, Khem, etc.). VIR. Feet together, hands with clenched fingers & thumbs, thrust out forwards, are held to the temples, the head is bowed & pushed out as if to symbolize the butting of an horned beast (Attitude of Pan, Bacchus, etc.). MULIER. The feet are widely separated & arms raised so as to suggest a crescent, the head is thrown back. (Attitude of Isis in Welcome, the Microcosm of Vitruvius). MATER TRIUMPHANS. (Isis Rejoicing) The feet together, left arm curved as if supporting a child; thumb & index finger of right hand pinches the nipple of the left breast as if offering it to that child. (Correct attitude of the Madonna). XI. The SECRET FOUR-FOLD WORD. Utter this by simply opening the mouth & breathing in, then breathe out & close the mouth (symbolizes the RUACH ELOHIM, the HOLY SPIRIT). XII. The secret significance of words used in the Ritual will be found in their numeration. Thus LA is 31, Sh (Shin) has the ATU XX & so is 20, T (Teth) has the ATU XI & so is 11, thus ShT as a whole is 31 & LAShTAL is 93. Greek words of course follow Greek values. NOTE: In THE SIGNS OF THE GRADES, the Zelator & Practicus are correct as given in Sect. VIII, above. Any other placing, such as an interchange between the two, is a mistake. You are expected to use the proper Sign of your own Grade as instructed when you make your Magical Entry & so instruct your own I.I. when they attain a new Grade.
