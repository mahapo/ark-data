[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ACCEPTED NEOPHYTE 1=10      1 NEOPHYTE 1=10 SUPPLEMENT A 1. The nature of the Work of the Neophyte is more complex and demanding than is intimated in the 1=10 Commission of Frater Γενεσθαι (C.F. Russell). While that Commission is enough for the Grade insofar as it concerns G.’.B.’.G.’., it is not enough to prepare the Neophyte for the many requirements that he or she, as a Zelator 2=9, may require to fulfill the needs of those of lower grades. 2. The Neophyte should become familiar with Liber E and Liber O, in order that he or she may be trained in the rudiments of Yoga and Magick so that he or she may be in a position to advise those entrusted to him or her. 3. It is highly suggested that he or she begin work with section I (MMM) of Liber HHH. 4. The work in sections V and VI of Liber O are very relevant to the Grade of 1=10, and should be worked and practiced, with the Record thereof turned in prior to receiving the Grade of Zelator 2=9. In that Grade one takes responsibility for the Order in a far more serious capacity, and it is in the best interest of all that one be prepared. 5. It is exceedingly important at this time that one begin to seek out one to follow you, who is willing to take the 0=0 Grade. After 2=9 one cannot progress, without special circumstances, until one has prepared one to follow you. Frater S.I. fratersi@yahoo.com July 20, 2012 "}]
