The instant any obstacle—either external or internal—appears to prevent your executing any of our commands immediately count that as a signal meaning you are near success. 3. Decide and decree definitely what you truly want. 4. The attainment of your chosen goal depends on four things: A. The preservation of the MAGICAL LINK you now have with the MASTERS. Your enemy will strive in many ways both violent and subtle to sever this link. Remember section 2, above. V. The Conquest of the SPHINX. As a Neophyte you begin to make and master the elemental weapon known as the PANTACLE. Your enemy will employ both strength and cunning to destroy or hide your PANTACLE. Remember section 2, and redouble your efforts to do exactly as you are told. M. The Right Use of the Eucharist to fortify and develop your BODY-OF-LIGHT. As a Neophyte you will partake daily of the SACRAMENT-OF-THE-  PANTACLE. GN. KEEPING SILENCE! 5. You are appointed at once to execute the following commission. To accomplish section 3, elect as RULER over all your desires that ONE which seems to you most important. Seek no outside help in this matter—do wholly as you please! This task is an alchemical process, a magical rite, and a TITANIC test. Therefore, so that you may work scientifically the following method is prescribed. 6. Once, each day, just before retiring, make an entry in your MAGICAL RECORD to consist of a clear verbal picture of that definite thing you wish more than anything else in this or any other world. You are about to be invested with command of the forces of EARTH; the SLAVE-OF-THE-RING and the SLAVE-OF-THE-LAMP will serve you in direct ratio to your fidelity to section one. Hence, describe exactly, minutely, accurately, plainly, without hesitation or mental reservation, in simple and concise language, whether it be possession or position, subjective or objective, or of some other category, including all its quantity, quality, and condition, precisely what you will to happen. As the EARTH turns on its axis, while the RUACH ELOHIM travels the  ANCIENT WAY, the reality of your sovereign ideal shall grow and become more sharply defined through the influence of your focused attention.

If you can distinguish the coyness of affinity from the true instinct of incompatibility, then correct the shape and substance of the creature of your craving. But in every change labour to improve, to approach what is more beautiful and attractive to you than anything else you can imagine. Be in earnest, remembering your OATH-OF-TRUTH, otherwise the game is not worth the candle, and you might as well resign yourself to remaining a mediocrity. For you cannot bluff the Guardian of the CITY-OF-THE-PYRAMIDS! 7. When you have completed a lunar cycle, or else twenty-eight days, send your MAGICAL RECORD to us, and while it is in our hands rest completely from this task.

You are prohibited from accepting, as a Member of our Body, money or other material reward, for personal profit or advantage, directly or indirectly, for any service connected with the .’.ORDER. The penalty is immediate expulsion, with no possibility of reinstatement on any terms soever. This injunction does not, however, prevent your selecting a material goal in accordance with section 6, if you are so disposed. 9. Now you must at once begin to practice the Fourth Power of the SPHINX. Actually conceal the nature and being of your chosen RULER, your purpose, plan, and method, from every other microcosmic being. Never under any circumstances speak of your desire either before or after you obtain the thing you want. A leak is a break in your MAGICAL CIRCLE and extremely dangerous both to yourself and to your fellow Members in the .’.ORDER. Your enemy will tempt you in every possible way to betray your secret, applying every artifice of all the fiends of Hell. Remember section 2, and thrice beware. Recall to mind that there is absolutely nobody and nothing in all the universe to whom or to which you need or can look for approval or applause; there is no law beyond—do as you please!
