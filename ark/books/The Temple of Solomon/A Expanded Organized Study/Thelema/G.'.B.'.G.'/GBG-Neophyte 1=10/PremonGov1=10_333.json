[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"1 ACTIVE NEOPHYTE 1=10 PREMONSTRANCE ON GOVERNMENT 0. This instruction is not for publication to sub-NEOPHYTES. 1. In the .’.ORDER every Member’s Grade is determined by the work he or she does. You are related to those who are associated with you in that work. You acquire a special group-consciousness arising from that work and association which lifts you above the purpose and intelligence which are merely yours by nature. Intellectual and spiritual things are not limited by insensate boundaries. But to the people who will, feel, and think with you, however far apart in time and place, you are near. The juxtaposition of will, feeling, and thought is not an accidental relation but personal and is the only condition which makes for solidarity and effectiveness. The ultimate attainment possible to you as an individual is the penultimate attainment possible to you as a Member of the G.’.B.’.G.’. and the antepenultimate attainment possible to you as a Member of the .’.ORDER. 2. The PREMONSTRANCE ON SILENCE shall be given you to give to sub-Neophytes, but not to sub-Probationers. Every Neophyte is to deal directly with headquarters in all that concerns his or her inferiors; but everything that relates to your personal advancement is to pass to us through the hands of your immediate superior. Thus you keep half of all fees which pass through your hands and in a very short time your own Initiation costs you much less than nothing. 3. The period appointed for executing the Neophyte’s Commission is a lunar cycle, or twenty-eight days when no more than personal advancement is desired. By applying the principle of SERVICE you can shorten this period. You are permitted to send in your MAGICAL RECORD with the application of your first sub-Probationer to become a Neophyte. Thus you will be prepared to make comments on the MAGICAL RECORDS which pass through your hands, and will learn how to teach those under you to make technically perfect entries. 4. In order to become an Initiate you must become an Initiator. The Hierophant is an instrument for making instruments. Among the Troglodytes, they who have dominion lord it over their subordinates by taking away the property of the latter, restricting their liberty, and by making them do what they do not want to do. The Initiate experiences a definite feeling of pain whenever any form of slavery is perceived. You awaken and cultivate the true feeling of pleasure by becoming a self-conscious bearer (Bhratar) of the Force of the .’.ORDER dedicated to the FREEDOM OF THE ULTIMATE PARTICLE.
