I agree completely withthis exposure and not only was it an honorable gesture for Θελημαto restore the body of the text deleted; it was in completecompliance with the Book of the Law to know and destroy thetraitors.The ordeals thou shalt oversee thyself, save only the blind ones.Refuse none, but thou shalt know & destroy the traitors.

That he was a traitor to the manCrowley, to the Master Therion Himself, the system of the A∴A∴;and to my Superior who was the most devoted disciple of KarlGermer there can no doubt from the following facts you will bereading below.Mr. Motta states that the purist will object to his changes in the textof Aleister Crowley; and this is no doubt a valid objection that whatAleister Crowley wrote, he wrote. It is historically dangerous toalter what he wrote for future scholars to actually be confused onwhat was originally written. Yet, this isn't necessarily why I leavethe Aleister Crowley text the way it was — and do not include hisedits with punctuation. Other purists object stating that in LiberOZ it states \"man\" is used in the sense of the word \"humanity\" andto be consistent with Mr. Motta's school of thought this would needto be changed — and therefore absolutely would be forbiddenwhereas this was given not only with Aleister Crowley's signaturebut the Seal of the Beast. An interesting point — with a validobjection. Yet I have no objections to the school of thought of MySuperior, my motives are infinitely more sublime. I will state thatthe School of thought of every Exempt Adept 7 °= 4▫ is unique; andeven state further that the School of thought of every Master of theTemple 8 °= 3▫ has its basis on what Instructions are given thoughthe Path of ד.

Confer AL III vs. 2.. When the words, \"Spelling isdefunct\" was proclaimed this began a new manifestation of theEnglish language that will evolve a grammar consistent with thestyle and manner from the Book of the Law.Therefore, this second edition will be unique — what MarceloMotta wrote remains completely intact except for some work withGreek and Hebrew that my Superior would have approved of. Thepublishing computer that was used was so low tech that such itemswere impossible to be included - and what Aleister Crowley wroteremains intact without the editing that was done.The first edition was written without the italics of Mr. Motta'scomments being inserted between the text — and this makes theedition very difficult at times to read. My Superior writes thefollowing in the first edition.:This text was composed under circumstances ofgreat hardship, between trips to Maine over the Weiserlawsuit, search for documents, reading of depositions,and harassment by Immigration. A computer progamwas learned and used in the preparation of the cameraready material; the program is severely limited in manyimportant points. For instance, it does not have a \"printpause\" command, nor sufficient flexibility forimprovising one. It was thus impossible to use adifferent font for italics. Accordingly, Marcelo Motta'snotes have been included within square brackets. Due tothe typewheel used, these are often hard to find, and thereader should strive not to confuse Motta's notes withCrowley's original text. A review of the program used,and a discussion of computers, printers and word-processing software will be included in Part II.As you note from the above, italics were clearly impossible for thelow tech publishing computer — and the accounts were drained as aconsequence of the court cases.Marcelo Motta had lived in a time where such computer programswere not as user friendly as the wonderful desktop publishing thatwe take for granted today — I am able to restore, and return to thesame formats that were used by previous editions.Yet, I am restoring more than just this — Being Aware of certain"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"magical gestures that in the experimental stage have had to bealtered to manifest Θελημα properly I have arisen from My Throneand thrust forth My Spear in a Magical Gesture of Adjustment.Am I stating that I am not in agreement with my Superior, MarceloMotta in the A∴A∴ and the O.T.O. by not proceeding precisely likehe did during his lifetime?

So far as Thelemites areconcerned, this is not and has never been a label of infamy. Rather,from the testimony of history, it has often been a label of merit.Sadly, in Mr. Regardie's case, an exception proves the rule.Some weak—minded correspondents of ours have, once in awhile, complained that we denounced Francis Regardie in pastThelemic publications. Some were so advanced in weak-mindedness — or in hypocrisy — that they pretended to be unableto understand why we were so \"hostile\" to Mr. Regardie — implyingthat we are intolerant of an individual, on the whole, valuable tosociety.We are not really concerned about the opinions of weak-minded people; they are usually weak—charactered, as Mr.Regardie is, although he certainly is not weak-minded. Anotherexception that proves the rule.We will not, therefore, try to defend ourselves against theaccusations, veiled or otherwise, of animosity towards Mr. Francis\"Israel\" Regardie. Our main concern is now, as it has always been,that, as long as his copyrights are protected by law, Aleister"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Crowley should not be misrepresented in print by liars or bythieves. Mr. Regardie, as his record proves, is both. Unhappily, toomany Jews these days are both, in some context or another. Some,like Mr. Menachem Begin, step further backwards, and becomealso terrorists and murderers. It may or may not be significant tothe reader that such unworthy Jews are usually \"Israelis.\" If thereis a pun here, it is not of our making. Indeed, we doubt it is of themaking of Mr. Francis \"Israel\" Regardie's parents.In 1937 e.v. (significantly, again, just before the start of theSecond World War) Mr. Regardie published, for the first time, his\"The Golden Dawn\" compilation. In his introduction to that bookhe stated he had felt compelled to publish it because AleisterCrowley had mangled much of the material in The Equinox. Theimplication was, all through the introduction, that what AleisterCrowley ever knew he had stolen from the Golden Dawn \"secretmanuscripts.\" This piece of misinformation has (still significantly)been methodically spread among publishing houses in manydifferent countries by an Israeli double agent called Oskar Schlag,of whom you will learn more in an essay further in this Oriflammenumber: an essay appropriately called \"Intelligence Services arenot intelligent.\"So far so good; Mr. Regardie had total legal freedom to libelAleister Crowley, because Crowley was dead by the time Mr.Regardie published the old Golden Dawn material. (By law, youcannot libel a dead person. You can say anything you want aboutthe dead. Even the heirs can not sue. De mortuis but the good, haha.) But if, as Mr. Regardie implied and often explicitly stated, allthat Crowley ever knew he stole from the Golden Dawn of\"MacGregor\" Mathers & Co., one would expect Mr. Regardie neverto touch Crowley material. After all, what use is Crowley material ifyou can have — thanks to Mr. Regardie's generosity, altruism, andmoral honestly — access to the fountainhead of wisdom in the four(two next, and now one) volumes of Mr. Regardie's \"The GoldenDawn?\"Unfortunately for Regardie, however, Mr. Karl Germer keptpublishing fresh Crowley material. Also unfortunately for Mr.Regardie, serious students of The Equinox were able to perceivethat Θελημα went light years beyond all the cumbersome, baroque,verbose and imprecise \"secret manuscripts\" that Mr. Regardie sogenerously \"gave\" to the world — collecting the royalties for hisown pockets. Much of the material in his \"The Golden Dawn\"edition was previously unpublished, mind you; therefore,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"copyright protected. Did Mr. Regardie pay royalties to the authors,or the heirs of the authors, of that material? Not so you couldnotice.Eventually, revenue from this first exercise stated to dry up:people lost interest in Regardie's \"The Golden Dawn\" once itbecame clear that it did not nearly match the material in TheEquinox, or in the new Crowley material Mr. Germer helped hisMaster publish, and after Crowley's death kept publishing (underconditions of great hardship): The Equinox of the Gods, EightLectures on Yoga, The Heart of the Master, Little Essays TowardsTruth, The Book of Thoth, The Gospel According to Saint BernardShaw, The Vision and the Voice Annotated, Magick Without Tears,777 revised, The Book of Lies Commented and — with the help ofyours truly — Liber Aleph. By the end of the Sixties, Francis\"Israel\" Regardie's disparagement of Crowley's genius was nolonger credible. Therefore, since by then Mr. Germer was dead andRegardie thought a thief has nothing to fear from the dead, hestarted pirating again — this time Crowley material. He publishedsomething called \"Gems from the Equinox.\"So far, not too far: since Crowley had deliberately allowed thecopyrights of the first Equinox volume to lapse, one could notaccuse Mr. Regardie of blatant theft, although one might think heshould have felt morally obliged to at least share royalties with theO.T.O. — had he any morals. Still, it is difficult to understand whyMr. Regardie should have felt compelled to edit \"gems\" from TheEquinox if, as he had previously stated in print, all the material init was cribbed from the ineffable mysteries of the \"pure\" GoldenDawn...Having noticed a resurgence of interest in \"his\" writingswith this publication, Mr. Regardie went further. He edited \"TheVision and the Voice Commented\" — and, since this book had beenoriginally done in a very small edition and was totally out of print,this time he felt safe to take one step further in his intellectual, ifnot material, theft: he added his asinine comments to AleisterCrowley's comments, troubling himself not at all about making adifference between them — an \"interpretation\" of AL I 22 thatwould subsequently prove helpful to other thieves. I ordered thisedition from Samuel Weiser, Inc.; upon its arrival in Brasil Inoticed the mangling of the text and mailed it back with a noteexplaining why I was rejecting it. This was reported to Regardie,along with my pointed comments on his ethics; and did notpredispose him to be one of my admirers. So much the better, for I"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"am sometimes weak enough to measure my worth by the worth ofthose who admire me; being admired by Francis \"Israel\" Regardiewould leave me deeply worried about myself.However, by the time my existence began to trouble Mr.Regardie, his presumption had already gone too far: he hadpublished his gelded edition of Magick Without Tears. This time itwas total legal theft. Mr. Regardie, upon becoming aware thatfinally someone had appeared on the scene who could legally claimto represent the O.T.O., began to try to extricate himself. Incontradictory statements (which we have in writing) made over aperiod of several years he claimed to different inquirers, first thatall the Crowley material, with the exception of his \"edition\" ofMagick Without Tears (!), was in the public domain, and \"Mottahad nothing to say about it.\" After some years, being notified byDonald Weiser or James Wasserman or some other liar and thieflike himself that I was still going strong, he stated that he hadpermission to publish Crowley from Joseph Metzger inSwitzerland. Upon being politely requested to present evidence ofMr. Metzger's \"permission,\" he sulked and went into the kind ofStainless Silence of which \"maharishis,\" \"paramanhansas\" andother \"holy masters\" are so fond at such occasions. Finally, morerecently, he stated that he had permission to publish from GradyMcMurtry. Upon again being politely asked to clarify whether this\"permission\" dated back to the time when he first stated that thematerial was in the public domain, or at least back to the time whenhe claimed to have Metzger's permission, he again chose towithdraw into Inscrutable Silence. We strongly doubt that thisplain, public unveiling of his lack of character will disturb theserenity of his Retirement.The Equinox Volume One was in the public domain by thetime Francis \"Israel\" Regardie picked his \"gems\" from it. In thatinstance, although Regardie was morally a thief, legally he was justa parasite. The Vision and the Voice Commented was not officiallycopyrighted, due to Mr. Germer's lack of familiarity with copyrightlaw: he thought the book was in the public domain, having firstbeen published in The Equinox Volume One; but the additionalCrowley comments were not in the public domain, and may still beprotected in the United States of America (they are certainlyprotected in many other countries, England included); this is oneof the points the O.T.O. is now determining in the courts.But in the case of Magick Without Tears, Regardie's positionthat he could publish this book because it was in the public domain"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"was a flagrant and malicious lie; as you can see from thephotographic reproductions on the next page:As already stated, when Regardie claimed \"permission\" fromMetzger we requested to see it in writing; which we — and so far aswe know, everybody else — never did. \"Permission\" fromMcMurtry (\"given\" years after the fact) we did not trouble torequest proof of, because quite possibly Regardie could exhibit ascrap of paper to that effect: it is well known by now that if I pointout that someone is a liar, a thief, or an incompetent, McMurtrywill hastily \"charter\" him or her in something or another, and\"grant\" him or her unmerited or preposterous titles. But as neitherMetzger nor McMurtry ever had sanction from Mr. Germer or fromhis executor to represent the Crowley copyrights (we are now inthe process of proving this in court) their \"permission\" to Regardieis no better than the permissiveness he allows himself.Although Mr. Germer, in many different letters, expressed tome his total lack of trust in Regardie's sincerity, I do not think heever realized that when Regardie appeared and offered his\"services\" to Θελημα and Aleister Crowley he was already, as JamesWasserman was when he offered his \"services\" to me, an agent ofsinister and powerful interests. Mr. Germer's explanation ofRegardie's \"disenchantment\" with Crowley was this: Crowley hadtold his secretary and \"disciple\" that the Master is selfish; and fromthat moment on Regardie had begun to fear Crowley was a \"BlackBrother,\" and decided to fight him for the rest of his life.This explanation, nevertheless, does not sufficiently dovetailwith the facts of Regardie's conduct in the years since Mr. Germer'sdeath. As to the Master being selfish; we deny Regardie moralcharacter or spiritual understanding, but we do not deny him plainold everyday Yiddish cunning and worldliness. It cannot fail tohave occurred to Regardie that if Crowley really was a \"BlackBrother,\" the last thing he would do would be to warn a discipleagainst himself: the average \"maharishi\" is far, of course, frombeing a \"Black Brother,\" but is astute enough to protest nothingbut \"endless love\" to his dupes.The selfishness of the Master is a fact; he or she cares forabsolutely nothing but his or her Work; disciples are merely toolsin the game of His or Her life, to be used (but not abused) ordiscarded as a child does to lead soldiers or to dolls. The Master ismerely an instrument of the Gods; His or Her \"personal\" life is anillusion; the Work which he or she was sent to do is all that"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"matters. The Juggernaut of the Hindus is nothing but an image ofthis — to the profane — terrible reality. If the disciple cannot acceptthis fact, and live with it, he or she is at perfect liberty to stop beinga disciple. But he or she should at least have the common decencyto feel grateful for the Master's frank warning, and not try to robHis or Her instrument of its property.I myself have often been accused — and from the point ofview of the accusers, I admit sometimes with cause — of beingunfeeling, overbearing, totally involved with myself, ruthlessly coldand, of course, always pitiless. I have been accused of not doing myWork, which from the point of view of the accusers should be thatof \"saving\" and \"consoling\" them. After all, am I not supposed to bea Servant of Humanity?But to be a Servant of Humanity is not to be babysitter toknaves or to fools; it is to cultivate the best, not the worst, in thesoul of those who come to you for instruction; it is to make goldfrom lead. The operation is far from painless, either to the primamateria or to the Alchemist (although the prima materia mayperhaps be forgiven for ignoring the problems of the latter — whatcan it know of the Pain of the Goat?) Our purpose, as Crowleyhimself inimitably stated, is twofold: to fortify the fit and toeliminate the unfit. If you want \"consolation\" and crave a safehaven, come not to the Master; go to the preacher or to thecharlatan (is there truly a difference between the two?) Youdeserve each other. I am not here to please you or to love you: I amhere to please Those who sent me, and to teach you to love Themmore than you \"love\" yourselves. In short, I am a Servant, andwould make Servants of you; meanwhile, I will make you into myservants. If the program does not please, it is useless to try tochange it; get away from me and go play with your toys.It would have been easier to believe in the sincerity ofFrancis \"Israel\" Regardie's \"disenchantment\" if he had gone awayto play with his toys; but it has become progressively clearer in thelast three decades that he wants to appropriate Crowley's toys toplay with. This present publication is proof that he will not beallowed to do this.This edition restores the original text of Magick WithoutTears, from which Mr. Regardie cut over fifteen thousand words; itrestores and increases the list of quoted books that appeared in thelegitimate original edition; and enlarges the index. It restores Mr.Germer's original introduction. It includes notes that explain"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"obscure points, clarify certain terms, and indicate what parts of thetext were excised by Mr. Regardie — sometimes explaining themotivation behind the cut. By and large, however, Mr. Regardie'scuts speak for themselves, and little by little build up anenlightening picture of his soul.There are certain changes in the text. First, punctuation.Unfortunately, many of the letters were dictated to Kenneth Grant,who by this time was Crowley's new secretary (he never had muchluck with secretaries, did he.) In letters to Mr. Germer, of which wehave copies, Crowley complained that Grant was in the habit ofchanging his text without consulting him. The punctuation in theoriginal edition is often irregular; this might also be due to whotyped it; whatever the reasons, we have tried to make it moreregular. Whenever it seemed to us, however, that the punctuationfollowed the rhythm of Crowley's speech rather than the rules ofgrammar, we left it intact.Second, we have changed the term \"Christianity\" and itsderivates to the term \"Christism,\" wherever it is clear in the textthat Crowley is not speaking about legitimate Christianity, of whichwe are the heirs, but of the Roman-Alexandrine con—game and itslater branches. The term \"Christism\" was invented by FernandoPessoa, the great Portuguese poet who became Crowley's pupil,King of the O.T.O. in Portugal, and eventually the first Thelemicallytrained Master of the Temple in a Latin country. The term isuseful, and we are sure that Crowley would have approved of thischange. Fernando Pessoa dedicated his life to fighting for Θελημαin his country; he died young under the terrible burden of constantattack by the Roman Catholic Church; he died unknown. He is nowrecognized as one of the greatest and most original poets of hiscountry; widely admired in Portugal and Brasil; translated intoseveral languages; frequently, like Shakespeare, quotedunknowingly, mostly by young people. With its usual cynicism, theRoman Catholic Church in Portugal and Brasil is now pretendingthat it always admired him. He will eventually be recognized as oneof the greatest poets of the world. There is a translation of hisworks in English; we have not read it, so cannot opine as to itsmerits; but for those who may be interested in the man, it might bea start. Of course, the essence of great poetry can usually be caughtin all its beauty only in the original idiom. Happy are they who canread Homer in Greek, Goethe, Schiller and Helne in German,Vatsyayana in Sanskrit, Omar Kayyam in Persian, the Koran inArabic, the Song of Songs in Hebrew, Lao Zi in Chinese... I envythem."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Third, and this will certainly raise some hackles amongpurists, we have changed terms that in these days of heightenedfeminine self—consciousness might be considered evidence ofsexism. Such changes can only be made when the expression wasmerely a figure of speech, and not indicate an opinion (or, if youwill, a prejudice) on Crowley's part. When it is clear that thereferences to the male or to the female were fully intended toexpress differences between the sexes, we left them intact. But thepronoun \"he\" and the term \"man\" have traditionally been used inEnglish for centuries to express not the male half of the speciesonly, but the species in general; and when such occasionshappened along, we adopted the cumbersome device of \"he or she\"or \"him or her\" and its like; for it is better to be cumbersome thanto be unclear. Crowley always spoke of the Initiate as a male, and ofthe Master of the Temple as \"he.\" But since this was not anexpression of prejudice (else, he would not have stated that HelenaPetrovna Blavatsky was a Master of the Temple, as he did; or thatSappho was a Philosophus who eventually became a DominusLiminis and in dying reached Adeptship), but merely a figure ofstyle, we have changed the form in an attempt to preserve thethought. Crowley has been accused — by the Roman CatholicChurch of course — of hating and despising women. You will noticethat most of the letters in Magick Without Tears were written towomen; and women should read them without being disturbed, inthese days of feminist activism that we can but encourage andapplaud, by conventions of speech. We are not sure that Mr. KarlJohannes Germer would have approved of this our initiative; butwe have done it on our Authority.These reservations expressed, you have here the originalCrowley text, pure and as intact as using Israel Regardies andKenneth Grants as secretaries could leave it.One of the reasons why I am most unsympathetic towardsFrancis \"Israel\" Regardie is that, at the time Magick Without Tearswas first published, he was enjoying good revenues from his \"TheGolden Dawn\" compilation and creating for himself, amongsuperficial thinkers, a reputation as a man of wisdom; yet, hecontributed nothing to the Crowley book he later pirated; he liftednot one finger to help. Magick Without Tears was printed underconditions of the greatest hardship: the text was typed on an earlyelectric typewriter (the same one on which Mr. Germer ordered meto type a list he had made of the books in the O.T.O. library; he alsoordered me to keep a copy of the list, that is now being used incourt to find out how much of the library was since criminally sold"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"by either Grady McMurtry, Helen Parsons-Smith, or Phylliswhatever); the result was mimeographed and bound. When I firsttalked of these things with Mr. Germer, I asked him how manycopies had been printed; he told me two hundred. Seeing theexpression on my face he asked if I thought the edition should havebeen larger. I said I thought it should have been at least athousand, upon which he grew greatly indignant; for he hadwanted to print at least a thousand, but the people — guess who —who had \"helped\" him put it out had protested this was not worththe trouble — they did not think even two hundred copies wouldsell. Who would want to read Aleister Crowley...?The final reason why I am unsympathetic towards Francis\"Israel\" Regardie — indeed, the reason why I will never forgivehim, and could never respect him, even as a fellow being; thereason why in my opinion he dishonors his religion and hisculture (as most Zionists do), is that when he first published hisMagick Without Tears piracy it went through two printings in amatter of months; he made good money from his theft; and he didnot send one cent of this money to Mrs. Sascha Germer, who (inthe absence of myself) was legally responsible for the Crowleycopyrights; to whom he should have gone for permission topublish (the trouble was, she would never have given it to him);who had then less than three years to live, and who was slowlystarving to death. Literally so. The reason why this conductdishonors his religion and his culture is that Mrs. Germer wasJewish; and a good Jew will never allow another Jew to starve,particularly a woman. This was the grimmest survival rule the Jewslearned, first from deprivation in the physical deserts of the MiddleEast, then from two thousand years of deprivation in the moraldeserts of the Christist world. Francis \"Israel\" Regardie is a badJew in the Jewish sense; and in any human sense he is anunscrupulous, presumptuous and contemptible creep. As I statedin my last letter to Mr. Donald Weiser, people like him andRegardie are a good excuse for Nazis: the kind of example they givecan only harm the Jews as a whole, for it can only harmhumankind. We will go into this in more detail in the essayappended to this book called \"Intelligence Services are notIntelligent.\"Since this number of The Oriflamme was prompted by theunethical behavior of one Jew, perhaps a reminder to unintelligentreaders is wanted. We have often been accused of anti—semitismbecause we criticize Jews who murder, exploit or rob members ofother cultural groups and sometimes even their fellow Jews. Those"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"who thus libel us forget, out of malice or stupidity, that ourcriticism of such behavior extends to all other members of ourspecies.

We think the average Jew is an outstandingasset to any society in which she or he may move and work.

Aleister Crowley met a lady who, having heard of his wideknowledge and experience, asked his advice on occult, spiritual andpractical mattersActually, those letters were addressed to different people, most of themwomen. Many were addressed to Jane Wolfe, who Crowley had met yearsbefore.This chance connection resulted in a stimulating exchange of letters.Crowley then asked others to put similiar questions to him. The result wasthis collection of over eighty letters which are now being issued over thetitle that he chose, \"MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS\".This was a take—off on an arithmetic primer for children that was abestseller for several decades.Crowley did not copies of his early letters to the above-mentioned lady,so was unable to to include them in the collection that he planned topublish. Fortunately they have been preserved and are now included in theintroduction to this book. Their original form has retained with theopening and closing formulae which Crowley used in all his letters. Crowleyat first intended to call the book ALEISTER EXPLAINS EVERYTHING, andsent the following circular to his friends and disciples asking them tosuggest subjects for inclusions:"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ALEISTER EXPLAINS EVERYTHING\"Much gratified was the author of THE BOOK OF THOTH to have somany letters of appreciation, mostly from women, thanking him for not'putting it in unintelligible language', for 'making it all so clear that even Iwith my limited intelligence can understand it, or think I do.'It is interesting that women responded to the EQ. III 5 in greaternumbers than men: the Roman Catholic Church had kept up an intensivecampaign against Crowley since Mussolini's days, accusing him in thepress, in private documents of Romish orders, and in confidentialinstructions to \"priests\" of being an enemy and despiser of womanhood.But the second World War had been very productive: with most youngmen on the front, bosses and managers had to hire women to positionswomen would usually not have occupied before the conflict, and even topromote them. An entire generation of females had a first taste ofpersonal freedom, and after the war was over many of them resentedhaving to give it up. Some never did, and the Feminist Revolutiongathered momentum from them. Thoughout this book, behind Crowley'sjokes and gibes, his deep love and respect for the so-called \"tender sex\"will become very clear\"Nevertheless and notwithstanding!

AMarch 19, 1943 e.v.Cara Soror:Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.I was very glad to gather from your conversation yesterday afternoonthat you have a serious intention of taking up the Great Work in the properspirit. Your criticisms of previous experience in the course of youradventures appeared to be singularly sane and just. As I promised I amwriting this letter to cover a few practical points which we had not time todiscuss and which in any case I think it better to arrange bycorrespondence.1) It is of the first importance that you should understand my personalposition. It is not actually wrong to regard me as a teacher, but it iscertainly liable to mislead; fellow-student, or, if you like, fellow-sufferer,seems a more appropriate definition.The purpose is to avoid, if possible, a devotional approach mingled withreligious awe on the part of the disciples. The Thelemic Method is, afterall, the Method of Science. Before I came to the United States to pick up"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"the pieces from the Gunther Gernon Cabiness III debacle of \"TrollPublishing\" I asked Soror K.A., who happened to be the woman —— andthe only man —— on the spot at the time: \"Make fun of me. Tell them littleridiculous things about me.\" Well, she did this great enthusiasm ——perhaps too great, but then, she also resented the Teacher —— whodoesn't? As a result, when I arrived I was looked upon with suspicion andeven with contempt; even so, it was necessary to beat them off to keepthem from sitting at my feet with their tongues hanging out to listen tomy Holy Discourses, instead of working their asses off and listening to thevoice of their own souls. Where any. Crowley was specially adept atpuncturing Holy Devotion Unto The Guru, and and is here being verytactful indeed. But this is one problem, as well as the solution, areincomparably discussed in Chapter M of Liber 333 Commented.Note by David Bersson: The reference to Soror K.A. (ClaudiaCanuto de Menezes) as a man was a sly poke at her bisexuality witha stronger tendency for women than men. Mr. Motta's remarkcame true that she truly resented the Master; and she betrayed himby not arranging a vote — separating legally from the Declaration ofTrust. She was a moron. I suspect at the time of her writing thenotarized document to separate from the Declaration of Trust shewas too stupid to realize that she was creating a situation whereMr. Motta's own writings would not be available in his nativecountry in his native tongue without his own devoted having topirate his books — a situation that he would of never approved of.)The climax of my life was what is known as the Cairo Working, describedin the minutest detail in The Equinox of the Gods...Book Four Part IV, The Law, to be published in this Volume of the THEORIFLAMME....At that time most of The Book of the Law was completely unintelligibleto me, and a good deal of it—especially the third chapter—extremelyantipathetic. I fought against this book for years; but it proved irresistible.I do not think I am boasting unfairly when I say that my personalresearches have been of the greatest value and importance to the study ofthe subject of Magick and Mysticism in general, especially my integrationof the various thought-systems of the world, notably the identification ofthe system of the Yi King with that of the Qabalah. But I do assure youthat the whole of my life's work, were it multiplied a thousand fold, wouldnot be worth one tithe of the value of a single verse of The Book of theLaw.I think you should have a copy of The Equinox of the Gods and makeThe Book of the Law your constant study. Such value as my own workmay possess for you should amount to no more than an aid to the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"interpretation of this book.2) It may be that later on you will want a copy of \"Eight Lectures onYoga\"...EQ. III No. 4, which will be re—issued, annotated, in due course....; so I am putting a copy aside for you in case you should want it.3) With regard to the O.T.O., I believe I can find you a typescript of allthe official documents. If so, I will let you have them to read, and you canmake up your mind as to whether you wish to affiliate to the Third Degreeof the Order. I should consequently, in the case of your deciding to affiliate,go with you though the script of the Rituals and explain the meaning of thewhole thing; communicating, in addition, the real secret and significantknowledge of which ordinary Masonry is not possessed.4) The horoscope; I do not like doing these at all, but it is part of theagreement with the Grand Treasurer of the O.T.O....At that time, Karl Johannes Germer. Mr. Germer was an excellentastrologer, and it is interesting that he should insist on Crowley drawingthe charts; it shows he considered Crowley a better astrologer thanhimself.... that I should undertake them in worthy cases, if pressed. But I preferto keep the figure to myself for future reference, in case any significantevent makes consultation desirable.Now there is one really important matter. The only thing besides TheBook of the Law which is in the forefront of the battle. As I told youyesterday, the first essential is the dedication of all that one is and all thatone has to the Great Work, without reservation of any sort...The one thing that Messrs. Regardie, Grant, Metzger, McMurtry, Mudd,Smith, Neuberg, Stansfleld Jones, and Mesdames \"Hirsig\", Wolfe, ParsonsSmith, Wade-Seckler-McMurtry and lots of less notorious people we couldmention, prove constantly, with tiresome regularity, totally incapable todo.This must be kept constantly in mind; the way to do this is to practice\"Liber Resh vel Helios, sub figura CC\". There is another version of theseAdorations, slightly fuller; but those in the text are quite alright. Theimportant thing is not to forget...That is, not to forget the dedication of all that one is and all that onehas, to the Great Work.... I shall have to teach you the signs and gestures which go with thewords.It is also desirable before beginning a formal meal to go through thefollowing dialogue: Knock 3—5—3: say, \"Do what thou wilt shall be thewhole of the Law.\" The person at the other end of the table replies: \"What"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"is thy Will?\" You: \"It is my Will to eat and drink.\" He: \"To what end?\" You: \"That my body may be fortified thereby.\" He: \"To what end?\" You:\"That I may accomplish the Great Work. \"...It is customary, if you are a Probationer or a Member of the G.D., to addat this point: \"The Knowledge and Conversation of my Holy GuardianAngel\".Note by David Bersson: It was never customary when I wasLodge Master of the Menthu Lodge or the 93 Lodge to do this; norhad Mr. Motta ever given me or any other student I know this\"custom\". I was, in fact, given an entire different instruction on thematter which I pass on to my students to this day....The other: \"Love is the law, love under will.\" You, with a single knock:\"Fall to.\" When alone make a monologue of it: thus, Knock 3-5-3. Dowhat, etc. It is my Will to, etc., that my body, et Cetera., that I may, etCetera., Love is, et Cetera. Knock: and begin to eat.It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of performing these smallceremonies regularly, and being as nearly accurate as possible with regardto the times. You must not mind stopping in the middle of a crowdedthoroughfare—lorries or no lorries—and saying the Adorations...Alas! Such counsels of perfection are for the future. You will attract notonly attention to yourself, but the deadly enmity of Christists —— to saynothing of other crapulous creeds —— if you do something like this. I usedto do it, when I was in college in the U.S.A., at a time when I was underspecial surveillance by order of Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, and remember beingapproached by an agent who made no special effort to remaininconspicuous and asked why I stopped in the middle of the street andbabbled words to myself. He knew perfectly well what I did, and why I didit, and was merely trying to fill his daily quota and earn his salary. Youshould say the Adorations fully whenever you can, but in public you maymerely say them interiorly, putting either your forefinger or your thumbto your lips, depending on your Grade or your pleasure. The importantdetail is not to forget them —— ever! Also, you must realize that theStations of the Sun have absolutely nothing to do with normal clock time.They have to do with Local Time, and most specially the merdian thathappens to be over your head. It is Noon when the Sun is crossing the localmeridian, no matter what the clock says. And if you are on a mountaintopthe Sun will set much later, and rise much earlier, than if you are in avalley. Skyscrapers also count. And south of the Equator, noon andmidnight are reversed cardinal points. Either you keep these things inmind or you will end up with dead dogma such as \"Christmas\" and HolyInquisitions in your hands. If you feel that it is better to have them in yourhands than at your throat, you are becoming crapulous, friend. Or ratherex — friend."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"...; and you must not mind snubbing your guest—or your host—if he orshe should prove ignorant of his or her share of the dialogue...Actually, social occasions are usually smoothly passed over by merelyapologizing to your host or partner, stating that you are going to say yourprayers, and doing it. There is nothing that shows more promptly whethera person deserves human company or not than their reaction to such asimple request.Christists, as a rule, will automatically assume that you are performingwhat they call prayers, but since the occasion is social you do not have todisillusion them unless they force you to. In this writer's experience, theyoften do. But then it is their fault, as usual, and not yours.... It is perhaps because these matters are so petty and trivial inappearance that they afford so excellent a training. They teach youconcentration, mindfulness, moral and social courage, and a host of othervirtues.Like a perfect lady, I have kept the tit bit to the last. It is absolutelyessential to begin a magical diary, and keep it up daily. You begin by anaccount of your life, going back even before your birth to your ancestry. Inconformity with the practice which you may perhaps choose to adopt later,given in Liber Thisarb, sub figura CMXIII, paragraphs 27-28, Magick, pp.420—422, you must find an answer to the question: \"How did I come to bein this place at this time, engaged in this particular work?\" As you will seefrom the book, this will start you on the discovery of who you really are,and eventually lead you to your recovering the memory of previousincarnations.As it is difficult for you to come to Town except at rare and irregularintervals, may I suggest a plan which has previously proved very useful, andthat is a weekly letter. Eliphas Lévi did this with the Baron Spedalieri, andthe correspondence is one of the most interesting of his works. You asksuch questions as you wish to have answered, and I answer them to the bestof my ability. I, of course, add spontaneous remarks which may be elicitedby my observations on your progress and the perusal of your magicaldiary. This, of course, should be written on one side of the paper only, sothat the opposite page is free for comments, and an arrangement should bemade for it to be inspected at regular intervals.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally,666LETTER NO. B"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"April 20, 1943 e.v.Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the LawI was very glad to have your letter, and am very sorry to hear that youhave been in affliction. About the delay, however, I think I ought to tell youthat the original Rule of the Order of A∴A∴ was that the introducer readover a short lection to the applicant, then left him alone for a quarter of anhour, and on coming back received a \"yes\" or \"no.\" If there was anyhesitation about it the applicant was barred for life.The reason for the relaxation of the rule was that it was thought better tohelp people along in the early stages of the work, even if there was no hopeof their turning out first—class...That relaxation was a mistake which has seriously affected the progressof the Work, since it produced people like Regardie, Stanfeld Jones,Kenneth Grant, Grady McMurtry, Phyllis Wade-Seckler-McMurtry, HelenParsons Smith, etc. etc. etc. If people are not going to turn out first classthey should be ruthlessly discarded; we are not in the salvation business,we are in the teaching business. If a person is obviously unfit it is amistake to encourage them in the delusion that they can make progress.This progress is usually at the expense of the energy of the instructor, thatwould be better applied teaching someone worthier. I myself wasintroduced to the Order according to the original rule. I had exactly fiveminutes to decide if I wanted to join or not. And every time I have relaxedthis rule with one of my pupils that pupil has eventually proved unworthy,and the Work has been harmed by her or him.... But I should like you to realize that sooner or later, whether in thisincarnation or another, it is put up to you to show perfect courage in face ofthe completely unknown, and the power of rapid and irrevocable decisionwithout without counting the cost.I think that it is altogether wrong to allow yourself to be worried by\"psychological, moral, and artistic problems.\" It is no good your startinganything of any kind unless you can see clearly into the simplicity of truth. All this humming and hawing about things is moral poison. What is the useof being a woman if you have not got an intuition, an instinct enabling youto distinguish between the genuine and the sham?On the other hand, see his remarks on the Woman Formula in Letter 53,\"Mother—Love\". So-called \"feminine intuition\" can be found in both sexes,and was very rare in Western women in the Old Aeon: perceptivetemperaments had been ruthlessly weeded out by the Christistdenominations, women exhibiting it being accused of witchcraft, satanism,et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Only the \"comfortable\" type of women,exhibiting the \"virtues\" that Romanism considered useful to itsdomination were allowed to thrive."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Intuition, so-called, is simply a well—developed Neschamic with theRuach. If you were incarnated in a female body it was indeed easier forthis link to form and endure; but the energies of the Aeon of Horus (Cf.LXV v 5-7, 44)provide both sexes with the opportunity of intuition now.Crowley knew perfectly well, but was talking down to the level of thedisciple. The need to do this leads the Masters often to being accused ofcontradiction, silliness, or even dishonesty.Your state of mind suggests to me that you must have been, in the past,under the influence of people who were always talking about things, andnever doing any real work. They kept on arguing all sorts of obscurephilosophical points; that is all very well, but when you have succeeded inanalyzing your reactions you will understand that all this talk is just anexcuse for not doing any serious work.Does any of you recognize himself or herself in this description? Verylikely not. Alas!I am confirmed in this judgment by your saying: \"I don't know if I want toenter into a great conflict. I need peace.\"\" Fortunately you save yourself byadding: \"Real peace, that is living and not stagnant.\" All life is conflict. Every breath that you draw represents a victory in the struggle of the wholeUniverse. You can't have peace without perfect mastery of circumstance;and I take it that this is what you mean by \"living, not stagnant.\"Generous as always, loving as always. What she really meant was thelegendary stork's device of sticking your head in a hole in the sand andleaving your bottom to the wind.But it is of the first consequence for you to summon up the resolution tostamp on this sea of swirling thoughts by an act of will; you must say:\"Peace be still.\" The moment you have understood these thoughts for whatthey are, tools of the enemy, invented by him with the idea of preventingyou from undertaking the Great Work—the moment you dismiss all suchconsiderations firmly and decisively, and say: \"What must I do?\" andhaving discovered that, set to work to do it, allowing of no interruption,you will find that living peace which (as you seem to see) is a dynamic andnot a static condition. (There is quite a lot about this point in Little EssaysToward Truth, and also in \"The Vision and the Voice\".)The Vision and the Voice will also be presently reprinted by us: thishas been made necessary by more of Mr. Israel Regardie's meddling withthings beyond his competence.Your postscript made me smile. It is not a very good advertisement forthe kind of people with whom you have been associated in the past. Myown position is a very simple one. I obeyed the injunction to \"buy aperfectly black hen, without haggling.\" I have spent over 100,000 poundsof my inherited money on this work: and if I had a thousand times thatamount today it would all go in the same direction. It is only when one is"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"built in this way, to stand entirely aloof from all considerations oftwopence halfpenny more or fourpence halfpenny less, that one obtainsperfect freedom on this Plane of Disks.Well, not quite; or rather, not in the least, if you are a Thelemite, for asthe Lord of the Aeon Himself remarked, all must be done \"with businessway\". This attitude of indifference to money only works insofar as nomoney is needed for the Work, and even then we are skeptical about itsvalue. It is proper to Eastern Masters (real ones, not the millionaire\"maharishis\" and \"gurujis\" and whatever), but not to us. You cannot buildLodges without money, publish books without money, travel to farawaycaves without money, etc., etc., etc. The error consists in valuing money initself as a proof of achievement, rather than as a means to it.Crowley erred constantly by not observing the recommendations in theThird Chapter of AL, which he admittedly abhorred. He never, forinstance, took the trouble to copyright Equinox I 1 - 10, declaring (as Mr.Germer told me upon asking) that he felt it should belong to Mankind. Weall know how Mankind manifested its gratitude. His next attack ofanimadversion led him to sell Boleskine House, his last anchor to financialsecurity, and give the money to the O.T.O.: the Grand Treasurer Generalhe had chosen promptly stole it. By 1919 e.v. he had partly recovered hissenses, and Equinox III 1 was copyrighted in his name upon beingpublished in the United States; but again the text of this book containedserious errors of doctrine that conflicted glaringly with the Third Chapterof the Book of the Law. This time, the Lord Himself intervened: theintended No. 2, which was even worse in this respect, never appeared.Subsequent numbers of Equinox III were published with extremesacrifice and at great intervals. Without the abnegation of Karl JohannesGermer, the publication of of No. 3, The Equinox of the Gods, No. 4,Eight Lectures on Yoga, and No. 5, The Book of Thoth, would neverhave occurred.Mr. Germer himself suffered of this ambivalence towards money. Iremember his making my son's horoscope and describing it to me in aletter. He detected in the boy, among other things, a tendency to\"acquisitiveness\", and remarked in an aside \"I do not like it\". But withoutsome degree of acquisitiveness you are liable to end up your life, asCrowley did, depending on the generosity of your disciples; and if youponder on the average generosity of the average disciple you will do wellto keep in mind Chapter 55 of Liber 333, which Crowley himself,unfortunately for him, for Mr. Germer, and for me, never did.Being a \"Crowley disciple\" is not, as I know to my regret, conducive toyour getting and keeping good jobs, specially at a managerial level; beinga Crowley thief, like Regardie, Grant, McMurtry and others, helps. This isreflexion on the society in which we live, not on Crowley. Future disciplesmay have it better, but they will do well to count their pennies meanwhile"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"and keep a wary eye for the intelligence services which, tools of theestablished cults that they are, keep hounding our feet and passing on the\"confidential information\" to our possible employers that we aresatanists, or anarchists, or nazis, or drug dealers, or sex perverts, orwhatever. If I sound overly indignant in this paragraph, it is because I amreliving three decades of such \"attentions\" from the F.B.I., the C.I.A., ShinBeth, the Brasilian Military Intelligence, and perhaps even the K.G.B.. Itgets boring after a while, you know.All the serious Orders of the world, or nearly all, begin by insisting thatthe aspirant should take a vow of poverty...See what I mean? There he goes again. This is absolutely not Thelemicat all....; a Buddhist Bhikku, for example,can own only nine objects—his threerobes, begging bowl, a fan, toothbrush, and so on. The Hindu andMohammedan Orders have similar regulations; and so do all the importantOrders of monkhood in Christianity...He means Christism. Yet, it was exactly the cults derived from thoseorders that the Lord of the Aeon decried as crapulous! It is quite obviousthat even near the end of his life Crowley did not like the Third Chapter ofThe Book of the Law at all. Yet in the next paragraph hisresponsibilities as Prophet are again affirmed.Our own Order is the only exception of importance; and the reason forthis is that it is much more difficult to retain one's purity if one is living inthe world than if one simply cuts oneself off from it. It is far easier toachieve technical attainments if one is unhampered by any suchconsiderations. These regulations operate as restrictions to one'susefulness in helping the world. There are terrible dangers, the worstdangers of all, associated with complete retirement. In my own personaljudgment, moreover, I think that our own ideal of a natural life is muchmore wholesome.When you have found out a little about your past incarnations, youshould be able to understand this very clearly and simply.What I have found about my past incarnations has confirmed myposition, which is his own Position as Prophet: wealth and power shouldbelong to those who will use such attributes to serve humankind, not toabuse it. If millionaires were initiates or heeded initiates, capitalismwould neither oppress nor generate poverty; and if commissars wereinitiates or heeded initiates, communism would work as well in practice asit is supposed to work in theory.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally,666"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"LETTER NO.

Even after affiliation, you wouldnot meet anyone unless it were necessary for you to work in cooperationwith them. I am afraid you have still got the idea that the Great Work is atea—party. Contact with other students only means that you criticize theirhats, and then their morals; and I am not going to encourage this. Yourwork is not anybody else's; and undirected chatter is the worst poisonouselement in human society.When you talk of the \"actual record\" of the \"Being called Jesus Christ,\" Idon't know what you mean. I am not aware of the existence of any suchrecord. I know a great many legends, mostly borrowed from previouslegends of a similar character.It would be better for you to get a copy of \"The Equinox of the Gods\" andstudy it. The Great Work is the uniting of opposites. It may mean theuniting of the soul with God, of the microcosm with the macrocosm, of thefemale with the male, of the ego with the non-ego—or what not.By \"love under will\" one refers to the fact that the method in every caseis love, by which is meant the uniting of opposites as above stated, such ashydrogen and chlorine, sodium and oxygen, and so on. Any reaction what-ever, any phenomenon, is a phenomenon of \"love\", as you will understandwhen I come to explain to you the meaning of the word \"point—event\". Butlove has to be \"under will,\" if it is to be properly directed.

The Christist concept isthat you live only one life, in which you are doomed to hell from the start,unless you save your soul by the benevolent mediacy of whatever branchof the Romish heresy happens to vampirize your cultural group, in whichcase you go to purgatory or even heaven after you die. Karma implies thatyou live a series of lives, and learn what is \"good\" for you by trial anderror. The need for \"salvation\" and the threat of \"eternal damnation\" areconcepts totally alien to the concept of Karma.The question about money does not arise.

In order to think for oneself a personhas to strip himself or herself from all prejudices of upbringing, culturalgroup and education. In this sense, a college education is a handicaprather than an advantage, since it simply means that mind was subjectedto extra conditioning, unless the individual was fortunate enough to go toone of the first rate universities, where freshmen are taught to thinkrather than to learn by rote. Such universities are becoming fewer andfewer in these days of intellectual conflict between so—called capitalismand so—called marxism, for the \"leaders\" on both sides find it moreprofitable to themselves to foster political and social dogma than toencourage free inquiry and free spirits. The process of stripping oneselffrom one's acquired prejudices is extremely painful to the pupil, and mostnaturally give up and go back to the herd.

First, you will notice nowseriously Crowley took the secrecy of the O.T.O. material, ritualsinclusive. You will see later on that Mr. Israel Regardie, in his piracy,excised a long paragraph that makes it quite clear Crowley would neverhave either welcomed or allowed the publication of the secret rituals ofthe O.T.O. in book form. The reasons why Mr. Regardie excised thatparagraph will become progressively clear as we go on. Second, Mr.Germer, when editing the letters, withdrew any reference to the name ofMr. X... Y..., although the man was then deceased. Mr. Germer did so toprotect both the man's family and his friends from the kind of \"attention\"that was then being served on Thelemites by the F.B.I. of Messrs. Hooverand McCarthy. Do not forget that this book was first published, in its onlylegal edition before the present one - and the only intact edition beforethis one — in 1954 e.v. At Hoover's instigation the F.B.I. had hounded bothMr. and Mrs. Germer in such a manner that they were forced to leave NewYork and take residence in Hampton, New Jersey. To the agents' credit wemust add that they were not willing to do this: the letters from Hoover tothem actually threaten them with sanctions if they don't find something tothe Germer's discredit. Apparently Hoover was in good faith about this:he had obviously received \"confidential information\" that led him tobelieve the Germers were guilty of horrible crimes. Since Hoover workedclosely with the Vatican throughout (both he and McCarthy were RomanCatholics) the entire witch-hunt of the Fifties, one does not have towonder where he got his prejudice. The agents finally got some lameaccusations that Mr. Germer was a Nazi sympathizer from the owner of\"an occult bookshop the subject patronizes,\" and Hoover seems to havebecome satisfied with that. It was enough to send agents to all of Mrs.Germer's pupils — she taught piano in private — and warn them againsther. She lost the majority of them, and with the pupils went the incomethat supported them both in New York City. Hence the move to Hampton,where I first met the both of them.The above quotations are from the F.B.I. archives, material that thebureau was forced to reveal under the Freedom of Information Act whichsome of Mr. Reagan's supporters in the Senate and the House haveexpressed a pious desire to have repealed.

It is interesting that he should beaccused of Nazism, and Mrs. Germer be accused of Nazism, when not onlywere they both refugees from Nazism but also Mrs. Germer herself wasJewish. Mr. Germer was married three times: two of his wives wereJewish. One of the motives he was put in a concentration camp by theNazis was that he was sympathetic towards Jews. He once wrote me thathe would rather deal with a Jew than a Christist any time, a sentiment inwhich I heartily concur. I do not hold it against Jews that people likeDonald Weiser, Israel Regardie and Oskar Schlag happen to dishonortheir culture and their faith. \"Mr. X...

(Perhaps some of these regulations are hard tograsp: personally, I can never understand all this By-Law stuff. So youmust ask me what, and why, and so on.)This is said in perfect sincerity. The man Crowley, the \"scribe,\" is atotally different energy-structure from the adept who conceived andorganized the structure of the A∴A∴ system, or the Master who energizedit. The only necessary link is that one is the instrument of the others. Thisshould absolutely not be confused with the spiritualist concept of\"mediumship,\" but it is understandable that a profane mind may beunable to perceive the difference. However, even the first and mostelementary Trance of Union will show the novice that there are moreplanes to his or her consciousness than the ones in which featherlessbipeds usually function.There is really only one point for your judgment. \"By their fruits ye shallknow them.\" ...Yes, but the author of this famous sentence seems not to have ponderedthat one person's fruit is another person's poison; to say nothing of hogsor monkeys.

Well, I employ the figure ofhyperbole, that I admit ...Meaning that he is exaggerating a little to impress the importance ofisolation upon her. It was too early in the day for him, in his Pure Fool'sinnocence, to perceive the disquiet this rigorous secrecy would provoke inbenevolent governments everywhere. Services of \"intelligence\" — onereally wonders at why they are given that name, when they are usuallymanned by the narrowest type of moral and intellectual homo saps - fret alot at all this mystery: we must be trying to keep people apart from eachother so we can manipulate them more easily, or teach them all kinds ofunspeakable obscenities. Through the years, I have had pupils who are notreally pupils at all, but relay all the advice they are given to a centralpanel of \"psychologists\" or computer scenario or whatnot that is trying todiscover what makes us, or at least me, tick. I have learned to detect thetype: they usually take at least a month to answer letters of advice or toreact to orders, because they have to send it in and wait for instructions.Unfortunately, one's oath demands that one should put up with this kind ofthing, at least until the time when these traitors either give up or areordered off by their bosses. But it is impossible to stress the importance ofworking in isolation in the system of the A∴A∴, at least in the stagesbefore you reach Zelator fully. Probationers are putrid, and Neophytes arenaughty; they invariably interfere with each other, besides pestering youunceasingly, if you allow them to hold too much intercourse - of any kind -with each other or with you!... but it really won't do to have a dozen cooks at the broth!

Hewas, true, aware of the lady's egocentricity and tried in vain, with thisdevice, to give her a more mystic motivation; but it is better to watch thedeeds, rather than the words. Usually the Probationer has no real idea ofhis or her Will in joining the Order; very often they have no ideawhatsoever of what the Order really is: the sublimity of the A∴A∴ isbeyond the conception of any but the highest type of Aspirant. This is whythe Probationer is granted the privilege of changing his or her Motto onbecoming a Neophyte, something that one can normally do only whenpassing from the G.D. to the R.R. et A.C. and hence to the S.S.

Note how new cognate ideas arise to enrich theformula.666LETTER NO. FAug. 20, 1943 e.v.Cara Soror:Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the LawLet me begin by referring to my letter about the motto and make clear toyou the working of this letter.In this motto you have really got several ideas combined, and yet theyare really, of course, one idea. Fiat, being 811, is identical with IAO, andtherefore FIAT YOD might be read not only as \"let there be\" (or \"Let mebecome\"), the secret source of all creative energy, but as \"the secret sourceof the energy of Jehovah.\" The two words together, having the value of 831,they contain the secret meanings Pyramis and Phallos, which is the sameidea in different forms; thus you have three ways of expressing the creativeform, in its geometrical aspect, its human aspect, and its divine aspect. Iam making a point of this, because the working out of this motto shouldgive you a very clear idea of the sort of way in which Qabalah should be"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"used. I think it is rather useful to remember what the essence of theQabalah is in principle; thus, in your correspondence for Malkuth, Yesod,and Hod you are simply writing down some of the ideas which pertain tothe numbers 10, 9, and 8 respectively. Naturally, there is a great deal ofredundancy and overloading as soon as you get to ideas important enoughto be comprehensive; as is mentioned in the article on the Qabalah in\"Equinox\" Vol. I, No. 5, it is quite easy to prove 1 = 2 = 3 = 4, etc.Within the \"universe of discourse\" of the Qabalah, of course. But even insome forms of Higher Mathematics the proposition can be proven - again,within a determined \"universe of discourse.\" Please keep in mind thatalthough a universe of discourse may include several other universes ofdiscourse, the reasoning in the included ones should be strictly limited totheir own boundaries; this is another form of stating that the planes mustnot be mixed.On the other hand, you must be careful to avoid taking thecorrespondences given in the books of reference without thinking out whythey are so given. Thus, you find a camel in the number which refers to theMoon, but the Tarot card \"the Moon\" refers not to the letter ג which meanscamel, but to the letter ק, and the sign ♓ which means fish, while the letteritself refers to the back of the head; and you also find fish has the meaningof the letter נ. You must not go on from this, and say that the back of yourhead is like a camel—the connection between them is simply that they allrefer to the same thing.In studying the Qabalah you mention six months; I think after that timeyou should be able to realize that, after six incarnations of uninterruptedstudy, you may realize that you can never know it; as Confucius said aboutthe Yi King. \"If a few more years were added to my life, I would devote ahundred of them to the study of the Yi.\"If, however, you work at the Qabalah in the same way as I did myself, inseason and out of season, you ought to get a very fair grasp of it in sixmonths. I will now tell you what this method is: as I walked about, I madea point of attributing everything I saw to its appropriate idea. I would walkout of the door of my house and reflect that door is ד, and house ב; now theword \"dob\" ...Daleth + Beth... is Hebrew for bear, and has the number 6, which refers to the Sun. Then you come to the fence of your property and that is ח—number 8,number of Tarot Trump VII, which is the Chariot: so you begin to lookabout for your car. Then you come to the street and the first house you seeis number 86, and that is Elohim, and it is built of red brick which remindsyou of ♂ and the Blasted Tower, and so on. As soon as this sort of work,which can be done in a quite lighthearted spirit, becomes habitual, you willfind your mind running naturally in this direction, and will be surprised at"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"your progress. Never let your mind wander from the fact that yourQabalah is not my Qabalah; a good many of the things which I have notedmay be useful to you, but you must construct your own system so that it isa living weapon in your hand.I think I am fair if I say that the first step on the Qabalah which may becalled success, is when you make an actual discovery which throws light onsome problem which has been troubling you. A quarter of a century ago Iwas in New Orleans, and was very puzzled about my immediate course ofaction; in fact I may say I was very much distressed. There seemed literallynothing that I could do, so I bethought myself that I had better invokeMercury. As soon as I got into the appropriate frame of mind, it naturallyoccurred to me, with a sort of joy, \"But I am Mercury.\" I put it into Latin—Mercurius sum, and suddenly something struck me, a sort of namelessreaction which said: \"That's not quite right.\" Like a flash it came to me toput it into Greek, which gave me \"'Ερμης Ειμι\" and adding that up rapidly, Igot the number 418, with all the marvellous correspondences which hadbeen so abundantly useful to me in the past (See Equ. of the Gods, p. 138). My troubles disappeared like a flash of lightning.Now to answer your questions seriatum; it is quite all right to putquestions to me about The Book of the Law; a very extended commentaryhas been written, but it is not yet published. I shall probably be able toanswer any of your questions from the manuscript, but you cannot go onafter that when it would become a discussion; as they say in the law-courts,\"You must take the witness's answer.\"II. The Qabalah, both Greek and Hebrew, also very likely Arabic, wasused by the author of The Book of the Law. I have explained above theproper use of the Qabalah. I cannot tell you how the early Rosicruciansused it, but I think one may assume that their methods were not dissimilarto our own. Incidentally, it is not very safe to talk about Rosicrucians,because their name has become a signal for letting loose the mostdevastating floods of nonsense. What is really known about the originalRosicrucians is practically confined to the three documents which theyissued. The eighteenth century Rosicrucians may, or may not, have beenlegitimate successors of the original brotherhood—I don't know. But fromthem the O.T.O. derived its authority; The late O.H.O. Theodor Reusspossessed a certain number of documents which demonstrated the validityof his claim according to him; but I only saw two or three of them, and theywere not of very great importance. Unfortunately he died shortly after thelast War, and he had got out of touch with some of the other GrandMasters. The documents did not come to me as they should have done ...This remark should be clarified: before dying, Reuss appointed Crowleyhis Successor as O.H.O.; and the O.H.O. is curator of all the property of theOrder. The O.H.O. is not \"elected,\" as Grady McMurtry slyly tried to makebelieve in one of his \"epistles\" to his faithful: he is always appointed by"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"his or her predecessor. Only in the case the O.H.O. should die withoutappointing a successor are the National Grand Masters General to hold anelection to appoint one. Crowley appointed Karl Johannes Germer hisSuccessor as O.H.O. unequivocally, in letters to many pupils, Mr.McMurtry included; and Mr. Germer, also unequivocally, appointed me ashis Successor on his deathbed, as reported by his wife. The only reasonwhy I have not assumed the title is that I have never wanted it; myinterest has always been the A∴A∴, not in the O.T.O., and I should likevery much to do what many of my Brethren and Sisters have done beforeme, and Parsifal Krumm-Heller was fortunate enough to be able to do twodecades ago, to wit: to vanish from public view and lead my own magickaland spiritual life. But I am obligated by my Oath, and will stick arounduntil I can find a replacement. I am beginning to think that I will diebefore this happens, considering the astounding rate at which all mypupils fail to qualify for any sort of responsible position. Character, alas,has never been an abundant commodity, and in these days of \"democracy\"versus the \"godless\" it seems to become rarer every day. I have metpeople of character in the course of my adventures, but none stupidenough to want to take my place. Fools, of course, are always rushing in,the pests....; they were seized by his wife who had an idea that she could sell themfor a fantastic price; and we did not feel inclined to meet her views. I don'tthink the matter is of very great importance, the work being done bymembers of the Order all over the place is to me quite sufficient.One can see that Theodor Reuss, albeit O.H.O., was not competentenough to choose a proper mate for a man of his responsibilities; but theGerman O.T.O., with very few exceptions, notably Karl Johannes Germer,were mostly ego-inflated masons with no dedication or higher capacity ofany sort; about on the level of the Grady McMurtrys, Israel Regardies andthe average Grand Blah-Blah in the average \"masonic lodge\" in the U.S.A.and everywhere else in the \"free world.\"III. The Ruach contains both the moral and intellectual worlds, which isreally all that we mean by the conscious mind; perhaps it even includescertain portions of the subconscious.The average reader may ask here, \"But don't you know for sure?\" Ofcourse he did not know for sure: Crowley invented parapsychology single-handedly; he was the first Master to openly apply the Method of Scienceto the Aim of Religion. Only future generations of researchers will be ableto establish quantitative analysis of the Ruach, as of other parts of thehuman being not as yet identified in the physical body. Brain research willhelp, but unless the researchers have mystical or magickal training theywill miss much of the utmost importance.IV.

The main point seems to be that in aspiring to Power one is limited bythe True Will. If you use force, violating your own nature either from lackof understanding or from petulant whim, one is merely wasting energy;things go back to normal as soon as the stress is removed. This is onesmall case of the big Equation \"Free Will = Necessity\" (Fate, Destiny, orKarma: it's all much the same idea). One is most rigidly bound by thecausal chain that has dragged one to where one is; but it is one's own selfthat has forged the links.The point is that unless the individual develops knowledge of that partof the self which forges the links, he or she may either be totally impotentin life or deviate completely from the path of his or her own soul. This isan ad for parapsycho-analysis, that is to say, initiation.Please refrain from the obvious retort: \"Then, in the long run, you can'tpossibly go wrong: so it doesn't matter what you do.\" Perfectly true, ofcourse!

But the answer is simple enough: you happen to be the kind of beingthat thinks it does matter what course you steer; or, still more haughtily,you enjoy the pleasure of sailing.No, there is this factor in all success: self-confidence. If we analyze this,we find that it means that one is aware that all one's mental and physicalfaculties are working harmoniously. The deadliest and subtlest enemy ofthat feeling is anxiety about the result; the finest gauze of doubt is enoughto dim one's vision, to throw the entire field out of focus. Hence, even to beaware that there is a result in prospect must militate against that serenityof spirit which is the essence of self-confidence. As you will know, all ourautomatic physiological functions are deranged if one is aware of Thisthen, is the difficulty, to enjoy consciously while not disturbing the processinvolved. The obvious physical case is the sexual act: perhaps its chiefimportance is just that it is a type of this exceptional spiritual-mentalcondition.

In a very realsense this is what is meant by the apparently high-sounding phrase, \"Theessence of Existence is joy;\" or, as it is even better put by the author ofThe Book of the Law, \"Remember all ye that existence is pure joy.\"... With a little imagination one can conceive the analogical case of theUniverse itself; and, still less fettered by even the mildest limitation whichmaterial symbols necessarily (however little) suggest, \"Remember all yethat existence is pure joy.\" (AL II 9)It is important to understand that this is a scientifically ascertainablefact, not an empty theological promise. Even cancerous cells have joy inorganizing themselves; the fact that the body undergoing the process doesnot as a whole enjoy it is just a part of the Universal Joke. But unlesscomplicated by external factors, cancer is a psychosomatic disease. Cancerin the body usually reflects a conflict in the soul, which is perhaps thereason why cancer is quickly becoming the most common disease of ourtimes.Is it too bold to suggest that the gradual merging of all these Ways intoan interwoven unity may be taken as one mode of presentation of theAccomplishment of the Great Work itself?At least, I feel fairly satisfied the meditation of them severally and jointlymay help you to an answer to your first question.2.

I wish I had practiced it moreoften.And you repeatedly insist that it is difficult. It isn't. Is there, however,some deep-seated inhibition—a (Freudian) fear of success? Is there someconnection with that sense of guilt which is born in all but the very few?The innate sense of guilt is a result of extended pruning of thepopulation of Europe during the religious persecutions and relentlessgenocide practiced by the Christists. A child born unashamed and happywas immediately suspected and \"humbled,\" and watched carefully to seehow it would grow. If you look around you, or think back to your ownchildhood, you will see that this method of child-rearing is still widelypracticed. I know it was practiced with me.But you don't give it a fair chance. There is, I admit, some trick, or knack,about getting properly across; a faculty which one acquires (as a rule) quitesuddenly and unexpectedly. Rather like mastering some shots at billiards. Practice has taught me how to communicate this to students; only in rarecases does one fail.

There he sat,with the veins on his forehead almost on the point of bursting, and thearms of my favourite chair visibly trembling beneath his powerful grip!)

In the Jewish pantheon there is only one God —Jehovah. (That Jehovah happens to be merely Amon-Ra \"without-teared\"by Moses down to the mentality of the slaves he was experimenting on istoo long a story for this note; it would take a whole book, and would haveto involve the politics of the Egyptian priesthood into the bargain.) In theEgyptian Theogony, the Gods — include Goddesses — succeed each otheras leaders. This is what is called the Succession of the Aeons. The \"Throneof Ra\" is successively occupied by different deities, and the Throne of Ra iscalled the \"Throne of the Unknown God\" precisely to leave open theoptions. This means freedom, variety and opportunity. The tyranny ofJehovah, of course, is comfortable for those who do not wish to think forthemselves or branch out into unknown, therefore terrible, territory; butjust as not every Jew is a bourgeois or an admirer of Menachem Begin,not every human being yearns for safety in life above all things.... and by the memory of my incarnation as Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, that I use it(with its Græco-Phoenician child) for all work of supreme import.

E.g. \"pretty\" means tricky, deceitful; on"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"the other hand, \"hussy\" is only \"housewife.\" It's amusing, too, this \"tabby\"refers to Prince Attab, the grandson of Ommeya—the silk quarter ofBaghdad where utabi, a rich watered silk was sold. This will soon give youthe power of discerning instantly when words are being used to hidemeaning or lack of it.This paragraph and the postscript were cut out by Mr. Regardie,presumably because he did not want to give offense to some of his friends:About A∴A∴, etc.: your resolution is noble, but there is a letter ready foryou which deals with what is really a legitimate enquiry; necessary, too,with so many hordes of \"Hidden Masters\" and \"Mahatmas\" and so onscurrying all over the floor in the hope of distracting attention from theinanities of their trusted henchmen.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally,666P.S. I must write at length about the Higher Self or \"God within us,\", tooeasy to get muddled about it, and the subject requires careful preparation.Actually, he had to write several. See Letters 28. 36, 42, and 43.LETTER ONE: WHAT IS MAGICK?Cara Soror:Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.What is Magick? Why should anyone study and practice it? Very natural;the obvious preliminary questions of any subject soever. We must certainlyget all this crystal clear; fear not that I shall fail to set forth the wholebusiness as concisely as possible yet as fully, as cogently yet as lucidly, asmay prove within my power to do.At least I need not waste any time on telling you what Magick is not; orto go into the story of how the word came to be misapplied to conjuringtricks, and to sham miracles such as are to this day foisted by charlatanswindlers, either within or without the Roman Communion, upon a gapingcrew of pious imbeciles.First let me go all Euclidean, and rub your nose in the Definition,Postulate and Theorems given in my comprehensive (but, alas! tooadvanced and too technical) Treatise on the subject ....Here he refers to Book Four Part III.Here we are!"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"I. DEFINITION:MAGICKis the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformitywith Will.(Illustration: It is my Will to inform the World of certain factswithin my knowledge. I therefore take \"magical weapons,\" pen,ink, and paper; I write \"incantations\"—these sentences—in the\"magical language\" i.e. that which is understood by people Iwish to instruct. I call forth \"spirits\" such as printers,publishers, booksellers, and so forth, and constrain them toconvey my message to those people. The composition anddistribution is thus an act ofMAGICK -by which I cause Changes to take place in conformity with my Will.In one sense, Magick may be defined as the name given to Scienceby the vulgar.)The difference is mainly one of purpose, not of matter. Science isthe observation and study of Nature. Applied Science is, on onelevel, technology; on several other levels, Magick.II. POSTULATE:ANY required Change may be effected by application of the properkind and degree of Force in the proper manner through theproper medium to the proper object.(Illustration: I wish to prepare an ounce of Chloride of Gold. Imust take the right kind of acid, nitro-hydrochloric and noother, in sufficient quantity and of adequate strength, and placeit, in a vessel which will not break, leak or corrode, in such amanner as will not produce undesirable results, with thenecessary quantity of Gold, and so forth. Every Change has itsown conditions.In the present state of our knowledge and power some changes arenot possible in practice; we cannot cause eclipses, for instance,or transform lead into tin, or create men from mushrooms. Butit is theoretically possible to cause in any object any change ofwhich that object is capable by nature; and the conditions arecovered by the above postulate.)"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"III. THEOREMS:1. Every intentional act is a Magical Act.In the original edition a footnote to this was switched by mistakefor the previous remark on Magick being the name given toScience by the vulgar. The footnote reads: \"By intentional Imean 'willed'. But even unintentional acts so-seeming are nottruly so. Thus, breathing is an act of the Will-to-Live.\" Anddeveloping a disease may be an act of the Will-to-Die.Illustration: See \"Definition\" above.)2. Every successful act has conformed to the postulate.3. Every failure proves that one or more requirements of thepostulate have not been fulfilled.(Illustrations: There may be failure to understand the case; aswhen a doctor makes a wrong diagnosis, and his treatmentinjures his patient. There may be failure to apply the right kindof force, as when a rustic tries to blow out an electric light. There may be failure to apply the right degree of force, as whena wrestler has his hold broken. There may be failure to applythe force in the right manner, as when one presents a cheque atthe wrong window of the Bank. There may be failure to employthe correct medium, as when Leonardo da Vinci found hismasterpiece fade away. The force may be applied to anunsuitable object, as when one tries to crack a stone, thinking ita nut.)4. The first requisite for causing any change is thoroughqualitative and quantitative understanding of the condition.(Illustration: The most common cause of failure in life isignorance of one's own True Will, or of the means by which tofulfill that Will. A man may fancy himself a painter, and wastehis life trying to become one; or he may be really a painter, andyet fail to understand and to measure the difficulties peculiar tothat career.)5. The second requisite of causing any change is the practicalability to set in right motion the necessary forces.(Illustration: A banker may have a perfect grasp of a givensituation, yet lack the quality of decision, or the assets,necessary to take advantage of it.)6. \"Every man and every woman is a star.\" That is to say, everyhuman being is intrinsically an independent individual with hisown proper character and proper motion.7. Every man and every woman has a course, depending partly on"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"the self, and partly on the environment which is natural andnecessary for each. Anyone who is forced from his own course,either through not understanding himself, or through externalopposition, comes into conflict with the order of the Universe,and suffers accordingly.(Illustration: A man may think it his duty to act in a certain way,through having made a fancy picture of himself, instead ofinvestigating his actual nature. For example, a woman maymake herself miserable for life by thinking that she prefers loveto social consideration, or vice versa. One woman may stay withan unsympathetic husband when she would really be happy in anattic with a lover, while another may fool herself into aromantic elopement when her only true pleasures are those ofpresiding at fashionable functions. Again, a boy's instinct may tell him to go to sea, while his parentsinsist on his becoming a doctor. In such a case, he will be bothunsuccessful and unhappy in medicine.8. A man whose conscious will is at odds with his True Will iswasting his strength. He cannot hope to influence hisenvironment efficiently.(Illustration: When Civil War rages in a nation, it is in nocondition to undertake the invasion of other countries. A manwith cancer employs his nourishment alike to his own use andto that of the enemy which is part of himself. He soon fails toresist the pressure of his environment. In practical life, a manwho is doing what his conscience tells him to be wrong will do itvery clumsily. At first!)Mr. Regardie, for instance, \"improved\" with practice.9. A man who is doing his True Will has the inertia of the Universeto assist him.(Illustration: The first principle of success in evolution is that theindividual should be true to his own nature, and at the sametime adapt himself to his environment.)But if the environment is decidedly hostile to the individual'sTrue Will, then it is necessary to change the environment or berestricted by it. This is the entire point of technology or ofMagick.10. Nature is a continuous phenomenon, thought we do not knowin all cases how things are connected.(Illustration: Human consciousness depends on the properties ofprotoplasm, the existence of which depends on innumerablephysical conditions peculiar to this planet; and this planet is"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"determined by the mechanical balance of the whole universe ofmatter. We may then say that our consciousness is causallyconnected with the remotest galaxies; yet we do not know evenhow it arises from—or with—the molecular changes in thebrain.)11. Science enables us to take advantage of the continuity ofNature by the empirical application of certain principles whoseinterplay involves different orders of idea, connected with eachother in a way beyond our present comprehension.(Illustration: We are able to light cities by rule-of-thumbmethods. We do not know what consciousness is, or how it isconnected with muscular action; what electricity is or how it isconnected with the machines that generate it; and our methodsdepend on calculations involving mathematical ideas which haveno correspondence in the Universe as we know it.Here he added the footnote: \"For instance, 'irrational,' 'unreal,'and 'infinite' expressions.\" These are all types of advancedmathematic operations without which the study of physics,specially nuclear physics, would be still at eighteenth centurylevel.12. Man is ignorant of the nature of his own being and powers. Even his idea of his limitations is based on experience of thepast. and every step in his progress extends his empire. Thereis, therefore, no reason to assign theoretical limits to what hemay be, or to what he may do.Here he added another footnote: \"i.e. except - possibly - in thecase of logically absurd questions, such as the schoolmendiscussed in connection with 'God'\".(Illustration: Two generations ago it was supposed theoreticallyimpossible that man should ever know the chemicalcomposition of the fixed stars. It is known that our senses areadapted to receive only an infinitesimal fraction of the possiblerates of vibration. Modern instruments have enabled us todetect some of these suprasensibles by indirect methods, andeven to use their peculiar qualities in the service of man, as inthe case of the rays of Hertz and Roentgen ...Respectively, radio waves and x-rays.As Tyndall said, man might at any moment learn to perceive andutilize vibrations of all conceivable and inconceivable kinds. The question of Magick is a question of discovering andemploying hitherto unknown forces in nature. We know thatthey exist, and we cannot doubt the possibility of mental orphysical instruments capable of bringing us in relation with"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"them.)13. Every man is more or less aware that his individualitycomprises several orders of existence, even when he maintainsthat his subtler principles are merely symptomatic of thechanges in his gross vehicle. A similar order may be assumed toextend throughout nature.(Illustration: One does not confuse the pain of toothache with thedecay which causes it. Inanimate objects are sensitive to certainphysical forces, such as electrical and thermal conductivity; butneither in us nor in them—so far as we know—is there anydirect conscious perception of these forces. Imperceptibleinfluences are therefore associated with all materialphenomena; and there is no reason why we should not workupon matter through those subtle energies as we do throughtheir material bases. In fact, we use magnetic force to moveiron, and solar radiation to reproduce images.)14. Man is capable of being, and using, anything which heperceives; for everything that he perceives is in a certain sense apart of his being. He may thus subjugate the whole Universe ofwhich he is conscious to his individual Will.(Illustration: Man has used the idea of God to dictate his personalconduct, to obtain power over his fellows, to excuse his crimes,and for innumerable other purposes, including that of realizinghimself as God. He has used the irrational and unrealconceptions of mathematics to help him in the construction ofmechanical devices. He has used his moral force to influencethe actions even of wild animals. He has employed poeticgenius for political purposes.)15. Every force in the Universe is capable of being transformedinto any other kind of force by using suitable means. There isthus an inexhaustible supply of any particular kind of force thatwe may need.(Illustration: Heat may be transformed into light and power byusing it to drive dynamos. The vibrations of the air may be usedto kill men by so ordering them in speech as to inflame war-likepassions. The hallucinations connected with the mysteriousenergies of sex result in the perpetuation of the species.)16. The application of any given force affects all the orders of beingwhich exist in the object to which it is applied, whichever ofthose orders is directly affected.(Illustration: If I strike a man with a dagger, his consciousness, nothis body only, is affected by my act; although the dagger, assuch, has no direct relation therewith. Similarly, the power of"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"my thought may so work on the mind of another person as toproduce far- reaching physical changes in him or her, or inothers through him or her.)17. A man (human being) may learn to use any force so as to serveany purpose, by taking advantage of the above theorems.Note by David Bersson: Note that Marcelo Mottareplaces \"man\" with \"human being\" throughout this textto clarify the equality of sexes; that every man & womenis a star. In the above comment I have included both —and yet now that the point is made We leave the rest as atestimony and lesson on how a expression can be somisleading. Yet, knowing this still does not alter the factthat this is not how Aleister Crowley wrote it — andtherefore all future text will be the way Aleister Crowleywrote it. Other Masters in time will arise and comment,no doubt, and other schools of thought will give newinsight. Yet, what Aleister Crowley wrote must not beconfused with \"another,\" \"Sphinx,\" or any successor Hemight manifest to Initiation to as a Magical Child. In theBook of the Law it is written: Every man and everywoman is a star. Yet, this is not a statement of equality,necessarily, yet it most certainly is on the plane ofphilosophy. Philosophy aside, there are stars and stars.Some brighter than others; and some not even from Oursystem. Yet, all we can immediately deduce that the staris man and women, or both as metaphor suddenlyawakens a insight of Neshemah.. In my commentarycalled Gold Coins I give an even more unique insight onthe subject of man & women being a star. That is, \"astar\". An insight never before given with any otherMaster in the past; and an insight that sheds light on theperception of \"day of be with us\", \"of us\", origin ofspecies from the point of view of the galaxy and cosmos —and of giving hints of an entirely new perspective on thedifference between those who are \"of us\" as a star & whatis meant by a profane not being of us.(Illustration: A man may use a razor to make himself vigilant overhis speech, by using it to cut himself whenever he unguardedlyutters a chosen word. He may serve the same purpose byresolving that every incident of his life shall remind him of aparticular thing, Making every impression the starting point of aconnected series of thoughts ending in that thing. He might alsodevote his whole energies to some particular object, by"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"resolving to do nothing at variance therewith, and to makeevery act turn to the advantage of that object.)18. He may attract to himself any force of the Universe by makinghimself a fit receptacle for it, establishing a connection with it,and arranging conditions so that its nature compels it to flowtoward him.(Illustration: If I want pure water to drink, I dig a well in a placewhere there is underground water; I prevent it from leakingaway; and I arrange to take advantage of water's accordancewith the laws of Hydrostatics to fill it.)19. Man's sense of himself as separate from, and opposed to, theUniverse is a bar to his conducting its currents. It insulates him.This is another and most important argument against any kind ofreligious dogma that considers anything in the Universe asintrinsically \"evil\" or \"hostile\" to the progress of the humanbeing or the \"welfare\" of our souls. The progress of science inthe West, for instance, was only possible after the decay ofChristism. Attempts to reinstitute medieval religion, such asthat of the \"Moral Majority\" nowadays in the U.S.A., areinvariably accompanied by attempts to deny or weaken scienceor true humanism, which derives from science.(Illustration: A popular leader is most successful when he forgetshimself, and remembers only \"The Cause.\" Self-seekingengenders jealousies and schism. When the organs of the bodyassert their presence otherwise than by silent satisfaction, it is asign that they are diseased. The single exception is the organ ofreproduction ...Not so: All the organs of elimination, of which the organ ofreproduction is just one particular case. If defecation andurination, for instance, were not pleasurable acts in any livingorganism, it would not survive for long the accumulation ofcatabolic products in itself.... Yet even in this case self-assertion bears witness to itsdissatisfaction with itself, since in cannot fulfill its function untilcompleted by its counterpart in another organism.)20. Man can only attract and employ the forces for which he isreally fitted.(Illustration: You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Atrue man of science learns from every phenomenon. But Natureis dumb to the hypocrite; for in her there is nothing false.Here he added the following footnote: \"It is no objection that thehypocrite is himself part of Nature. He is an 'endothermic'"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"product, divided against himself, with a tendency to break up.He will see his own qualities everywhere, and thus obtain aradical misconception of phenomena. Most religions of the pasthave failed by expecting Nature to conform with their ideals ofproper conduct.\" But here Crowley was being idealistic ratherthan objective. If such religions had \"failed,\" he would not havebecome so dissatisfied with his times and environment as to sethimself up as the new Christ. The dangerous point is, that it ismuch easier to assert a limited Will, based on a limitedperception of the Universe, than to assert an ampler will thattakes as much of the Universe into account as the instrument ofthat Will may be conscious of. In practice, the scientist isalways diffident; the fanatic is always loud and positive.Crowley's assertion above is tantamount to saying that theWill of a hypocrite cannot prevail upon Nature and his or herfellow beings. This is only correct in the long run — andsometimes in the very, very long run. Humankind, as a whole,cannot be enslaved by the false Will of a hypocrite; but humanbeings frequently are. Human life is brief. Christism is slowlydissolving at last its miasma of sickness and hatred, but it tookover a thousand years for brave human beings, patientlyworking, to achieve this dissolution with the relentless help ofNature. Jerry Falwell is extremely wrong, and I am extremelyright; but Jerry Falwell made fifty million dollars last year andI made nothing. So let us put it that the hypocrite is deaf toNature but not, unfortunately, dumb to his or her fellows. Onthe contrary, the more hypocritical they are, the morearticulate they become and the easier they are to understand,for what they have to say is always very simple. Unfortunatelyfor the unthinking masses, it is not the simplicity of synthesis,such as we find in Liber AL, but the simplicity of Restriction,such as we find in the Ten Commandments, or in the Creed ofNicea, or in The Communist Manifesto.21. There is no limit to the extent of the relations of any man withthe Universe in essence; for as soon as man makes himself onewith any idea, the means of measurement cease to exist. But hispower to utilize that force is limited by his mental power andcapacity, and by the circumstances of his human environment.(Illustration: When a man falls in love, the whole world becomes,to him, nothing but love boundless and immanent; but hismystical state is not contagious; his fellow—men are eitheramused or annoyed. He can only extend to others the effectwhich his love has had upon himself by means of his mental andphysical qualities. Thus, Catullus, Dante, and Swinburne made"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"their love a mighty mover of mankind by virtue of their powerto put their thoughts on the subject in musical and eloquentlanguage. Again, Cleopatra and other people in authoritymoulded the fortunes of many other people by allowing love toinfluence their political actions. The Magician, however well hesucceeds in making contact with the secret sources of energy innature, can only use them to the extent permitted by hisintellectual and moral qualities. Mohammed's intercourse withGabriel was only effective because of his statesmanship,soldiership, and the sublimity of his command of Arabic. Hertz's discovery of the rays which we now use for wirelesstelegraphy was sterile until reflected through the minds andwills of the people who could take his truth, and transmit it tothe world of action by means of mechanical and economicinstruments.)22. Every individual is essentially sufficient to himself. But he isunsatisfactory to himself until he has established himself in hisright relation with the Universe.(Illustration: A microscope, however perfect, is useless in thehands of savages. A poet, however sublime, must imposehimself upon his generation if he is to enjoy (and even tounderstand) himself, as theoretically should be the case.)23. Magick is the Science of understanding oneself and one'sconditions. It is the Art of applying that understanding inaction.(Illustration: A golf club is intended to move a special ball in aspecial way in special circumstances. A Niblick should rarely beused on the tee, or a Brassie under the bank of a bunker. But,also, the use of any club demands skill and experience.)24. Every man has an indefeasible right to be what he is.(Illustration: To insist that anyone else shall comply with one'sown standards is to outrage, not only him, but oneself, sinceboth parties are equally born of necessity.)Unless, of course, the other person has stated, apparently of hisor her own free will, that he or she wants to conform to yourstandards, and then proceeds to disprove this Will through hisor her deeds. Then you must tell them to either prove theirwords by their actions or go peddle their schizophrenia, true orassumed, elsewhere.25. Every man must do Magick each time that he acts or eventhinks, since a thought is an internal act whose influenceultimately affects action, thought it may not do so at the time."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"(Illustration: The least gesture causes a change in a man's ownbody and in the air around him: it disturbs the balance of theentire universe and its effects continue eternally throughout allspace. Every thought, however swiftly suppressed, has its effecton the mind. It stands as one of the causes of every subsequentthought, and tends to influence every subsequent action. Agolfer may lose a few yards on his drive, a few more with hissecond and third, he may lie on the green six bare inches too farfrom the hole; but the net result of these trifling mishaps is thedifference of a whole stroke, and so probably between havingand losing the hole.)26. Every man has a right, the right of self-preservation, to fulfillhimself to the utmost.Here he added the following footnote: \"Men of 'criminal nature'are simply at issue with their true Wills. The murderer has theWill-to-live; and his will to murder is a false will at variancewith his true Will, since he risks death at the hands of Societyby obeying his criminal impulse.\" This is, of course, an over-simplification of the issue, and supposes, first of all, that the\"Society\" lives by Thelemic principles, not by Christist, orMoslem, or Zionist, or Brahmin, or Marxist, or whatever. Mr.Menachem Begin is a model to \"Israelis;\" he is also a terroristand murderer to the British, the Arabs and, incidentally,myself. The laws of any \"Society\" that does not conform withthe Law of Θελημα will unfailing be restrictive, inecologicaland unjust. Galileo broke the law, and so did Crowley; did notthe tribunals of their times condemn both men? United StatesLaw sent Wilhelm Reich and Timothy Leary to prisons for theinsane where both underwent \"treatment;\" Nixon was electedand Kissinger stated publicly that there is no aphrodisiac likepower, both in that same period of time. One's exercise of one'sright to self-preservation in a society of slaves makes one acriminal at some time or another, and an \"enemy of thepeople.\" Keep that in mind.(Illustration: A function imperfectly performed injures, not onlyitself, but everything associated with it. If the heart is afraid tobeat for fear of disturbing the liver, the liver is starved forblood, and avenges itself on the heart by upsetting digestion,which disorders respiration, on which cardiac welfare depends.)27. Every man should make Magick the keynote of his life. Heshould learn its laws and live by them.(Illustration: The Banker should discover the real meaning of hisexistence, the real motive which led him to choose that"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"profession. He should understand banking as a necessary factorin the economic existence of mankind, instead of as merely abusiness whose objects are independent of the general welfare. He should learn to distinguish false values from real, and to actnot on accidental fluctuations but on considerations of essentialimportance. Such a banker will prove himself superior toothers; because he will not be an individual limited bytransitory things, but a force of Nature, as impersonal, impartialand eternal as gravitation, as patient and irresistible as thetides. His system will not be subject to panic, any more than thelaw of Inverse Squares is disturbed by Elections. He will not beanxious about his affairs because they will not be his; and forthat reason he will be able to direct them with the calm, clear-headed confidence of an onlooker, with intelligence uncloudedby self-interest and power unimpaired by passion.)28. Every man has a right to fulfill his own will without beingafraid that it may interfere with that of others; for if he is in hisproper path, it is the fault of others if they interfere with him.(Illustration: If a man like Napoleon were actually appointed bydestiny to control Europe, he should not be blamed forexercising his rights. To oppose him would be an error. Anyoneso doing would have made a mistake as to his own destiny,except in so far as it might be necessary for him to learn thelessons of defeat. \" The sun moves in space withoutinterference. The order of Nature provides a orbit for eachstar. A clash proves that one or the other has strayed from itscourse. But as to each man that keeps his true course, the morefirmly he acts, the less likely are others to get in his way. Hisexample will help them to find their own paths and pursuethem. Every man that becomes a Magician helps others to dolikewise. The more firmly and surely men move, and the moresuch action is accepted as the standard of morality, the less willconflict and confusion hamper humanity.)Well, here endeth the First Lesson.That seems to me to cover the ground fairly well; at least, that iswhat I have to say when serious analysis is on the agenda.But there is a restricted and conventional sense in which the wordmay be used without straying too far from the abovephilosophical position. One might say:—\"Magick is the study and use of those forms of energy which are(a) subtler than the ordinary physical-mechanical types, (b)accessible only to those who are (in one sense or another)'Initiates'.\" I fear that this may sound rather obscurum per"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"obscurius; but this is one of these cases— we are likely toencounter many such in the course of our researches—in whichwe understand, quite well enough for all practical purposes,what we mean, but which elude us more and more successfullythe more accurately we struggle to define their import.We might fare even worse if we tried to clear things up by makinglists of events in history, tradition, or experience and classifyingthis as being, and that as not being, true Magick. Theborderland cases would confuse and mislead us.But—since I have mentioned history—I think it might help, if Iwent straight on to the latter part of your question, and gaveyou a brief sketch of Magick past, present and future as it is seenfrom the inside.What are the principles of the \"Masters\"? What are They trying todo? What have They done in the past? What means do Theyemploy?As it happens, I have by me a sketch written by M. Gerard Aumontof Tunis some twenty years ago, which covers this subject withreasonable adequacy.I have been at the pains of translating it from his French, I hopenot too much reminiscent of the old traduttore, traditore. Iwill revise it, divide it (like Gaul) into Three Parts and send italong.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally,666The essay on the Three Schools of Magick is reproduced asLetters 6, 7, and 8. \"Traduttore, traditore\" is an Italian punmeaning, 'translator, traitor.' But in this case if Crowleybetrayed anyone it was himself, for the essay, although signedby Mr. Gerard Aumont, was written by Crowley himself.Aumont was not a pseudonym of Crowley's; he was a pupil fora while in Tunis. We have written extensive notes to this essay,for reasons that will be obvious to the serious reader when heor she gets to it.LETTER TWO: THE NECESSITY OFMAGICK FOR ALL"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Cara Soror:Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Right glad am I to hear that you have been so thoroughly satisfiedwith my explanation of what Magick is, and on what its theoriesrest. It is good, too, hearing how much you were interested inthe glimpse that you have had of some of its work in the world;more, that you grasped the fact that this apparently reconditeand irrelevant information has an immediate bearing on yourpersonal life of today. Still, I was not surprised that you shouldadd: \"But why should I make a special study of, and devote mytime and energy to acquiring proficiency in, the Science and Artof Magick?Obviously, this letter was written or re—written already havingin mind its publication as part of a series; it deviates fromCrowley's normal colloquial and joking manner.Ah, well then, perhaps you have not understood my remarks atone of our earliest interviews as perfectly as you suppose! Forthe crucial point of my exposition was that Magick is not amatter extraneous to the main current of your life, as music,gardening, or collection jade might be. No, every act of your lifeis a magical act; whenever from ignorance, carelessness,clumsiness or what not, you come short of perfect artisticsuccess, you inevitably register failure, discomfort, frustration. Luckily for all of us, most of the acts essential to continued lifeare involuntary; the \"unconscious\" has become so used to doingits \"True Will\" that there is no need of interference; when suchneed arises, we call it disease, and seek to restore the machineto free spontaneous fulfillment of its function.But this is only part of the story. As things are, we have alladventured into an Universe of immeasurable, of incalculable,possibilities, of situations never contemplated by the trend ofEvolution. Man is a marine monster; when he decided that itwould be better for him somehow to live on land, he had togrow lungs instead of gills. When we want to travel over softsnow, we have to invent ski; when we wish to exchangethoughts, we must arrange a conventional code of sounds, ofknots in string, of carved or written characters—in a word—embark upon the boundless ocean of hieroglyphics or symbolsof one sort or another. (Presently I shall have to explain thesupreme importance of such systems; in fact, the Universe itselfis not, and cannot be, anything but an arrangement of symboliccharacters!)Here we are, then, caught in a net of circumstances; if we are to do"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"anything at all beyond automatic vegetative living, we mustconsciously apply ourselves to Magick, \"the Science and Art\"(let me remind you!) \"of causing change to occur in conformitywith the Will.\" Observe that the least slackness or error meansthat things happen which do not thus conform; when this is sodespite our efforts, we are (temporarily) baffled; when it is ourown ignorance of what we ought to will, or lack of skill inadapting our means to the right end, then we set up a conflict inour own Nature: our act is suicidal. Such interior struggle is atthe base of nearly all neuroses, as Freud recently \"discovered\"—as if this had not been taught, and taught without his massederrors, by the great teachers of the past! The Taoist doctrine, inparticular, is most precise and most emphatic on this point;indeed, it may seem to some of us to overshoot the mark; fornothing is permissible in that scheme but frictionlessadjustment and adaptation to circumstance. \"Benevolence andrighteousness\" are actually deprecated! That any such ideasshould ever have existed (says Lao-tse) is merely evidence of theuniversal disorder.Taoist sectaries appear to assume that Perfection consists in theabsence of any disturbance of the Stream of Nescience; and thisis very much like the Buddhist idea of Nibbana.We who accept the Law of Θελημα, even should we concur in thisdoctrine theoretically, cannot admit that in practice the planwould work out; our aim is that our Nothing, ideally perfect asit is in itself, should enjoy itself through realizing itself in thefulfillment of all possibilities. All such phenomena or \"point-events\" are equally \"illusion\"; Nothing is always Nothing; butthe projection of Nothing on this screen of the phenomenal doesnot only explain, but constitutes, the Universe. It is the onlysystem which reconciles all the contradictions inherent inThought, and in Experience; for in it \"Reality\" is \"Illusion\",\"Free-will\" is \"Destiny\", the \"Self\" is the \"Not-Self\"; and so forevery puzzle of Philosophy.Not too bad an analogy is an endless piece of string. Like a drivingband, you cannot tie a knot in it; all the complexities you cancontrive are \"Tom Fool\" knots, and unravel at the proper touch. Always either Naught or Two!

In the last resort, Ishall have to maintain that we are justified by experience, by theempirical success in communicating thought which hasattended, and continues to attend, our endeavors.But to give a complete answer, I shall have to go back to thebeginning, and restate the original problem; and I beg that youwill not suppose that I am evading the question, or adopting theIrish method of answering it by another, though I know it maysound as if I were.Let me set out by restating our original problem; what we want isTruth; we want an even closer approach to Reality; and we wantto discover and discuss the proper means of achieving thisobject.Very good; let us start by the simplest of all possible enquiries—and the most difficult—\"What is anything?\" \"What do weknow?\" and other questions that spring naturally from these.I see a tree.I hear it—rustling or creaking in the wind.I touch it—hard.I smell it—acrid.I taste it—bitter."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The last two sensations depend on the type of tree, of course.Now all the information given by these five senses has to be puttogether, although no two agree in any sort of way. The logic bywhich we build up our complex idea of a tree has more holesthan a sponge ...The following paragraphs should be, and have been, mostattentively read by scientists, for Crowley is analysing the veryprocess of observation by which scientific research is possible;and he is analysing it in order to show the process throughwhich our minds perceive anything outside themselves — orrecreate from memory or imagination. What he is describing isone of the first discoveries of Pratyahara. It is deeplydisturbing at first for the mind to perceive the flimsiness, theirreality one might say, of the process by which it \"accessesreality.\" But how else can you study the instrument ofconsciousness? And unless you know the instrument as deeplyas you can, how can you use it efficiently?But this is to jump far ahead: we must first analyze the single,simple impression. \"I see a tree.\" This phenomenon is what iscalled a \"point-event.\" It is the coming together of the two, theseer and the seen. It is single and simple; yet we cannotconceive of either of them as anything but complex. And thePoint-Event tells us nothing whatever about either; both, asHerbert Spencer and God knows how many others have shown,unknowable; it stands by itself, alone and aloof. It hashappened; it is undeniably Reality. Yet we cannot confirm it; forit can never happen again precisely the same. What is evenmore bewildering is that since it takes time for the eye toconvey an impression to the consciousness (it may alter in 1,000ways in the process!) all that really exists is a memory of thePoint-Event. not the Point-Event itself. What then is thisReality of which we are so sure? Obviously, it has not got aname, since it never happened before, or can happen again! Todiscuss it at all we must invent a name, and this name (like allnames) cannot possibly be anything more than a symbol.Even so, as so often pointed out, all we do is to \"record thebehaviour of our instruments.\" Nor are we much better offwhen we've done it; for our symbol, referring as it does to aphenomenon unique in itself, and not to be apprehended byanother, can mean nothing to one's neighbors.

Rather regard it as a miraculousintervention of Providence when even one of even the simplestideas \"gets across.\" Now then, this being so, it is evidently goodsense to construct one's own alphabet, with one's own veryprecise definitions, in order to handle an abstruse and technicalsubject like Magick. The \"ordinary\" words such as God, self,soul, spirit and the rest have been used so many thousand timesin so many thousand ways, usually by writers who knew not, orcared not for the necessity of definition that to use them to-dayin any scientific essay is almost ludicrous.That is all, just now, sister; no more of your cavilling, please; sitdown quietly with your 777, and get it by heart!Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally,"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"666LETTER FOUR: THE QABALAH: THEBEST TRAINING FOR MEMORYCara Soror:Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Now you must learn Qabalah. Learn this Alphabet of Magick. Youmust take it on trust, as a child does his own alphabet. No onehas ever found out why the order of the letters is what it is. Probably there isn't any answer.The answer is simply that from the beginning the letters wereassociated with numbers, and an entire system of intertwinedsymbolic logic came out of it. Any other system, provided itwere coherent in itself, would serve — cf. Russell & Whiteheadon this in Principia Mathematica. The advantage of theQabalah is that is has been in use for so long that an entiresystem of archetypes has become associated with it. Thosearchetypes have their counterparts in other cultures, as it wasonly to be expected: the general principles of medicine can beused to cure any variant of the human species; and no matterhow much a human being may differ from another - somealmost looking like monkeys, and some almost behaving likemonkeys even if they do not look simian - they all belong to thesame species. The Qabalah was not, of course, invented by theJews themselves. They had it partly from the Babylonians,partly from the Assyrians, partly from the Egyptians. But thepractical Qabalah that Crowley is specifically talking aboutwas developed in the Middle Ages of Europe by a great Jewishgenius, Maimonides, in an effort to prove to the Christists thatthey and the Israelites had a common heritage of spiritualinsights with the so-called barbaric tribes of Europe and thewisdom of Islam and the Far East. Maimonides had help, ofcourse, in doing this, but deserves all the credit for givingmomentum to this effort to counteract the horror and thehatred hidden behind Christism's false message of \"love.\" Likeall things that have value for humankind beyond the life of ageneration, the Qabalah has changed and grown with thecenturies.

Theparagraph calls attention to Crowley's efforts at decipheringthe mysteries of the Yi Jing, and Helen Parsons-Smith hadjust put out her own \"edition\" of this Book. In view of the factthat Mr. Regardie claims that he had Crowley's best interestsat heart when he started pirating Crowley's work, and in viewof the fact that Mrs. Parsons-Smith, although not authorized topublish O.T.O. material, was at least an O.T.O. member(something that Mr. Regardie has never been and never willbe), it is interesting that he should try to hinder, rather than tohelp, her effort.

Forgive these tears!But our Magical Alphabet is primarily not letters, but figures, notsounds but mathematical ideas. Sir Humphrey Davy, comingout of his famous illumination (with some help from NitrousOxide he got in) exclaimed: The Universe is composed solely ofideas. We, analyzing this a little, say: The Universe is amathematical expression.Of course, the Universe is nothing necessarily of the sort. It wouldbe better to express both insights in this way: \"A certain regionof the human mind can apprehend the Universe solely asideas,\" and \"The constitution of the human mind tends to theinvestigation of the Universe through mathematicalprocesses.\" This, by the way, is in accordance with Crowley'sown advice. We are in extreme need of communication withother intelligent forms of life at this stage; there is no otherway to enrich our experiences. We might start by trying thecetaceans, although they are so close to us genetically. Theyare extremely intelligent, yet have never attempted to developa technology, have adapted to their environment rather thantried to change it; have been persistently harmed by us, and"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"yet persist in remaining friendly towards bothersome bipeds.An explanation of their motivations might enlarge ourconception of the Universe in a way to transcend allphilosophies and scientific speculations so far.Sir James Jeans might have said this, only his banker advised himto cash in on God ...Sir James Jeans was a physicist and a teacher, a contemporary ofEddington, and wrote some very clear books explaining physicsto the lay person. Eddington's literary work was, however, farsuperior in content.... The simplest form of this expression is 0 = 2, elsewhereexpounded at great length ...See letter 5. But it is also in practically every other letter of thisbook, and is the basis of Crowley's ontology.... This 2 might itself be expressed in an indefinitely great numberof ways. Every prime number, including some not in the seriesof \"natural numbers\", is an individual. The other numbers withperhaps a few exceptions (for instance 418) are composed oftheir primes.Each of these ideas may be explained, investigated, understood, bymeans very various. Firstly, the Hebrew, Greek and Arabicnumbers are also letters. Then, each of these letters is furtherdescribed by one of the (arbitrarily composed) \"elements ofNature; the Four (or Five) Elements, the Seven (or Ten)Planets, and the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac.As he says himself, the composition of those ideas is arbitrary,although very likely it was the product of \"astral investigation\"on the part of Maimonides and his collaborators. Among otherthings, we may consider \"Seven Elements,\" following theHindu-Tibetan esoteric tradition, or, as he says himself, TenPlanets (including the Moon) rather than just seven. The pointis that attempts to introduce these thoughts on the Tree seemto be successful. In a way, the Qabalistic Tree of Life provesitself by such additions, which complicate but furtherharmonize the whole. There is in this a parallel with the Tableof Elements; but it has, so far, proved extremely useful tomystics and magicians. One should not, however, exaggeratethis usefulness to the point of falling into the delusion that theQabalah is \"divinely ordained.\" I remember a conversation inBrasil with Oskar Schlag (who had come to feel me out foreither Shin Beth or the Vatican or the C.I.A. or more likely allthree at once) in which he protested against Crowley'sinversion of the Emperor and the Star on the Tree, implying it"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"was \"unorthodox.\" I suggested to him that the Mastersmanipulate the Tree for their own purposes from time to time,especially when the Aeons succeed each other, and he becamevery indignant about this.

One imagines these martyrs were oftendenounced by their own people; for if not heretics, they werecertainly \"satanists.\" One wonders if any of them raised theobjection that the law was made for man, and not man for thelaw, and what good it did them if they did.Every idea soever can be, and should be, attributed to one or moreof these primary symbols; thus green, in different shades, is aquality or function of Venus, the Earth, the Sea, Libra, andothers.

Forward! Paddle!Readers seriously interested in Thelemic philosophy — by which Imean those who want to live by it —— should pay closeattention to this demonstration. The entire concept of Θελημαsprings from it. The following is a sort of extended commentaryon AL I, 28-30, 45-46; II, 66, III 19-20.1. We are aware.2. We cannot doubt the existence (whether \"real\" or \"illusory\"makes no difference) of something, because doubt itself is aform of awareness.3. We lump together all that of which we are aware under theconvenient name of \"Existence\", or \"The Universe\". Cosmos isnot so good for this purpose; that word implies \"order\", whichin the present stage of our argument, is a mere assumption.4. We also tend to think of the Universe as containing things ofwhich we are not aware; but this is altogether unjustifiable,although it is difficult to think at all without making some suchassumption. For instance, one may come upon a new branch ofknowledge—say, histology or Hammurabi or the language of theIroquois or the poems of the Hermaphrodite of Panormita. Itseems to be there all ready waiting for us; we simply cannotbelieve that we are making it all up as we go along. For all that,it is sheer sophistry; we may merely be unfolding the contentsof our own minds. Then again, does a thing cease to exist if weforget it? The answer is that one cannot be sure.The reader is reminded that many states of insanity - amongwhich we definitely must include religious fanaticism - revolveprecisely around such points.Personally, I feel convinced of the existence of an Universe outsidemy own immediate awareness; but it is true, even so, that itdoes not exist for me unless and until it takes its place as partof my consciousness.This is added argument for trying to expand one's consciousness,and for not being too self-satisfied. I may not be aware that asupersonic airplane is coming towards me from the back; itmay not exist for me until the moment that it reduces me to ashower of disrupted colloid bits - but it then proves its"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"existence in a very thorough manner, and I will be even moreidiotic than the average fool if I call it \"evil\" or \"satanic\" as Idie, or call it \"The Will of God,\" which is simply another way ofexpressing my idiocy that kept me in the path of the airplane inthe first place.5. All this paragraph 4 is in the nature of a digression, for whatyou may think of it does not at all touch the argument of thisletter. But it had to be put in, just to prevent your mind fromraising irrelevant objections. Let me continue, then, from 3.6. Something is. (You must read the \"Soldier and TheHunchback\" in Equinox I 1. This something appearsincalculably vast and complex. How did it come to be?This, briefly, is the \"Riddle of the Universe,\" which has beenalways the first preoccupation of all serious philosophers sincemen began to think at all.7. The orthodox idiot answer, usually wrapped up in obscureterms in the hope of concealing from the enquirer the fact that itis not an answer at all, but an evasion, is: God created it.Then, obviously, who created God? Sometimes we have aDemiurge, a creative God behind whom is an eternal formlessGreatness—anything to confuse the issue!Sometimes the Universe is supported by an elephant; he, in turn,stands on a tortoise . . . by that time it is hoped that theenquirer is too tired and muddled to ask what holds up thetortoise.Sometimes, a great Father and Mother crystallize out of somehuge cloudy confusion of \"Elements\"and so on. But nobodyanswers the question; at least, none of these God-inventingmules, with their incurably commonplace minds.8. Serious philosophy has always begun by discarding all thesepuerilities. It has of necessity been divided into these schools:the Nihilist, the Monist, and the Dualist.9. The last of these is, on the surface, the most plausible; foralmost the first thing that we notice on inspecting the Universeis what the Hindu schools call \"the Pairs of Opposites.\"This too, is very convenient, because it lends itself so readily toorthodox theology; so we have Ormuzd and Ahriman, the Devasand the Asuras, Osiris and Set, et cetera and da capo,personifications of \"Good\" and \"Evil.\" The foes may be fairlymatched; but more often the tale tells of a revolt in heaven. Inthis case, \"Evil\" is temporary; soon, especially with the financialhelp of the devout, the \"devil\" will be \"cast into the Bottomless"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Pit\" and \"the Saints will reign with Christ in glory for ever andever, Amen!\" Often a \"redeemer,\" a \"dying God,\" is needed tosecure victory to Omnipotence; and this is usually what littlevulgar boys might call a \"touching story!\"10. The Monist (or Advaitist) school, is at once subtler and morerefined; it seems to approach the ultimate reality (as opposedto the superficial examination of the Dualists) more closely.It seems to me that this doctrine is based upon a sorites ofdoubtful validity. ...\"Sorites\" is a word from formal logic: it means a chain ofarguments in which each depends on the other to reach aconclusion.... To tell you the hideously shameful truth, I hate this doctrine sorabidly that I can hardly trust myself to present it fairly! But Iwill try. Meanwhile, you can study it in the Upanishads, in theBhagavad-Gita, in Ernst Haeckel's The Riddle of the Universe,and dozens of other classics. The dogma appears to excite itsdupes to dithyrambs. I have to admit the \"poetry\" of the idea;but there is something in me which vehemently rejects it withexcruciating and vindictive violence. Possibly, this is becausepart of our own system runs parallel with the first equations oftheirs.11. The Monists perceive quite clearly and correctly that it isabsurd to answer the question \"How came these Many things (ofwhich we are aware) to be?\" by saying that they came fromMany; and \"Many\" in this connection includes Two. TheUniverse must therefore be a single phenomenon: make iteternal and all the rest of it— i.e. remove all limit of any kind—and the Universe explains itself. How then can Opposites exist,as we observe them to do? Is it not the very essence of ouroriginal Sorites that the Many must be reducible to the One? They see how awkward this is; so the \"devil\" of the Dualist isemulsified and evaporated into \"illusion;\" what they call \"Maya\"or some equivalent term.\"Reality\" for them consists solely of Brahman, the supreme Being\"without quantity or quality.\" They are compelled to deny himall attributes, even that of Existence; for to do so wouldinstantly limit them, and so hurl them headlong back in toDualism. All that of which we are aware must obviously possesslimits, or it could have no intelligible meaning for us; if we want\"pork,\" we must specify its qualities and quantities; at the veryleast, we must be able to distinguish it from \"that-which-is-not-pork.\""},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"But—one moment, please!12. There is in Advaitism a most fascinating danger; that is that,up to a certain point, \"Religious Experience\" tends to supportthis theory.A word on this. Vulgar minds, such as are happy with a personalGod, Vishnu, Jesus, Melcarth, Mithras, or another, often excitethemselves—call it \"Energized Enthusiasm\" if you want to besarcastic!—to the point of experiencing actual Visions of theobjects of their devotion. But these people have not so much as asked themselves theoriginal question of \"How come?\" which is our present subject. Sweep them into the discard!13. Beyond Vishvarupadarshana, the vision of the Form of Vishnu,beyond that yet loftier vision which corresponds in Hinduclassification to our \"Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel\", is that called Atmadarshana, the vision (orapprehension, a much better word) of the Universe as asingle phenomenon, outside all limitations, whether of time,space, causality, or what not.Very good, then! Here we are with direct realization of theAdvaitist theory of the Universe. Everything fits perfectly. Also,when I say \"realization,\" I want you to understand that I meanwhat I say in a sense so intense and so absolute that it isimpossible to convey my meaning to anyone who has notundergone that experience. (I have discussed this and thefollowing points very fully in Book Four Part I.)See Yoga and Magick, pp. 47-66.How do we judge the \"reality\" of an ordinary impression uponconsciousness? Chiefly by its intensity, by its persistence, by thefact that nobody can argue us out of our belief in it. As peoplesaid of Berkeley's 'Idealism'—\"his arguments are irrefutable butthey fail to carry conviction.\" No sceptical, no idealist queriescan persuade us that a kick in the pants is not 'real' in anyreasonable sense of the word. Moreover memory reassures us. However vivid a dream may be at the time, however it maypersist throughout the years (though it is rare for any dream,unless frequently repeated, or linked to waking impressions bysome happy conjunction of circumstances, to remain long in themind with any clear-cut vision) it is hardly ever mistaken for anevent of actual life.

The supposed differences are merely the result ofcultural or religious conditioning.... in which this Atman (or Brahman), this limit—destroyingUniverse, is itself abolished and annihilated.(And, with this experience, smash goes the whole of the Advaitisttheory!)It is a commonplace to say that no words can describe this finaldestruction. Such is the fact; and there is nothing one can doabout it but put it down boldly as I have done above. It does notmatter to our present purpose; all that we need to know is thatthe strongest prop of the Monist structure has broken off short.Moreover, is it really adequate to postulate an origin of theUniverse, as they inevitably do? Merely to deny that there everwas a beginning by saying that this \"One\" is eternal fails tosatisfy me.What is very much worse, I cannot see that to call Evil \"illusion\"helps us at all. When the Christian Scientist hears that his wifehas been savagely mauled by her Peke, he has to smile, and saythat \"there is a claim of error.\" Not good enough.14. It has taken a long while to clear the ground. That I did notexpect; the above propositions are so familiar to me, they run socleanly through my mind, that, until I came to set them down inorder, I had no idea what a long and difficult business it all was.Still, it's a long lane, etc. We have seen that \"Two\" (or \"Many\")are unsatisfactory as origin, if only because they can always bereduced to \"One\"; and \"One\" itself is no better, because, amongother things, it finds itself forced to deny the very premises onwhich it was founded.Shall we be any better off if we assume that \"Ex nihilo nihil fit\" is afalsehood, that the origin of All Things is Nothing? Let us see!15. Shall we first glance at the mathematical aspect of Nothing? (Including its identical equation in Logic.) This I worked out solong ago as 1902 e.v. in Berashith, which you will find reprinted"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"in The Sword of Song, and in my Collected Works, Vol. I.The argument may be summarized as follows.When, in the ordinary way of business, we write 0, we shouldreally write 0n. For 0 implies that the subject is not extended inany dimension under discussion. Thus a line may be two feet inlength, but in breadth and depth the coefficient is Zero. Wecould describe it as 2f × 0b × 0d, or n2f + 0b + 0d./*I'm sure that's x not + as in the Motta commentary. I'll have tocheck this*/What I proposed in considering \"What do we mean by Nothing?\"was to consider every possible quality of any object as adimension.For instance, one might describe this page as being nf + n'b + n''d +0 redness + 0 amiability + 0 velocity + 0 potential and so on,until you had noted and measured all the qualities it possesses,and excluded all that it does not. For convenience, we may writethis expression as Xf+b+d+r+a+v+p—using the initials of thequalities which we call dimensions.Just one further explanation in pure mathematics. To interpretX1, X1+1 or X2, and so on, we assume the reference to be tospatial dimensions. Thus suppose X1 to be a line a foot long, X2will be a plane a foot square, and X3 a cube measuring a foot ineach dimension. But what about X4? There are no more spatialdimensions. Modern mathematics has (unfortunately, I think)agreed to consider this fourth dimension as time. Well, andX5? To interpret this expression, we may begin to considerother qualities, such as electric capacity, colour, moralattributes, and so on.3 But this remark, although necessary, leads us rather away fromour main thesis instead of toward it.16. What happens when we put a minus sign before the index (thatsmall letter up on the right) instead of a plus? Quite simple. x2= X1+1 = X1 + X1. With a minus, we divide instead ofmultiplying. Thus, X3-2 = X3 ÷ X2 = X1, just as if you had merelysubtracted the 2 from the 3 in the index.Now, at last, we come to the point of real importance to ourthesis: how shall we interpret X0? We may write it, obviously,as X1-1 or Xn-n. Good, divide. Then X1 ÷ X1 = 1. This is thesame, clearly enough, whatever X may be."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"17. Ah, but what we started to do was discover the meaning ofNothing. It is not correct to write it simply as 0; for that 0implies an index 01, or 0{2}, or 0n. And if our Nothing is to beabsolute Nothing, then there is not only no figure, but no indexeither. So we must write it as 00.What is the value of this expression? We proceed as before;divide.00 = 0n-n = 0n ÷ 0n = (0n ÷ 1) × (1 ÷ 0n). Of course 0n ÷ 1 remains0; but 1 ÷ 0{n} = ∞.That is, we have a clash of the \"infinitely great\" with the \"infinitelysmall;\" that knocks out the \"infinity\" (and Advaitism with it!)and leaves us with an indeterminate but finite number of uttervariety. That is: 00 can only be interpreted as \"The Universethat we know.\"18. So much for our demonstration. Some people have foundfault with the algebra; but the logical Equivalent is preciselyparallel. Suppose I wish to describe my study in one respect: Ican say \"No dogs are in my study,\" or \"Dogs are not in mystudy.\" I can make a little diagram: D is the world of dogs; S ismy study. Here it is:Diagram 1/*These two diagrams still have to be inserted. Also, I'll doublecheck the equations above..*\\The squares are quite separate. The whole world outside thesquare D is the world of no dogs: outside the square S, theworld of no-study. But suppose now that I want to make theZero absolute, like our 00, I must say \"No dogs are not in mystudy.\"Or, \"There is no absence-of-dog in my study.\" That is the same assaying: \"Some doge are in my study;\" diagram again:Diagram 2In Diagram 1, \"the world where no dogs are\" included the whole ofmy study; in Diagram 2 that absence-of-dog is no longer there;so one or more of them must have got in somehow.That's that; I know it may be a little difficult at first; fortunatelythere is a different way—the Chinese way—of stating thetheorem in very much simpler terms.19. The Chinese, like ourselves, begin with the idea of \"AbsoluteNothing.\" They \"make an effort, and call it the Tao;\" but that isexactly what the Tao comes to mean, when we examine it. Theysee quite well, as we have done above, that merely to assert"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Nothing is not to explain the Universe; and they proceed to doso by means of a mathematical equation even simpler than ours,involving as it does no operations beyond simple addition andsubtraction.

This then they did, and began to diagrammatize theUniverse as the Yi—a pair of opposites, the Yang or active male,and the Yin or passive Female, principles. They represented theYang by an unbroken ( — ), the Yin by a broken ( — — ), line.(The first manifestation in Nature of these two is Tai Yang, theSun, and the Tai Yin, the Moon.) This being a little large andloose, they doubled these lines, and obtained the four Xiang.They then took them three at a time, and got the eight Kwa.These represent the development from the original Yi to theNatural Order of the Elements.The serious student will find this whole subject amply developedin The Chinese Texts of Magick and Mysticism, EquinoxV, 3.I shall call the male principle M, the Female F.M.1.☰Qian\"Heaven-Father\".F.1.☷Kun\"Earth-Mother\"M.2.☲LiTheSunF.2. ☵KanTheMoonM.3.☳ZhenFireF.3.☱DuiWaterM.4.☴SunAirF.4.☶GenEarthNote how admirably they have preserved the idea of balance.

To remind you, and toamplify certain points of the above, let me quote from BookFour Part III:Pages 152-153, footnote 2, in the original edition. Book Four PartIII Commented, subtitled Thelemic Magick, will be issued soon.All elements must at one time have been separate—that would be the case with great heat. Now whenatoms get to the sun, we get that immense extremeheat, and all the elements are themselves again. Imagine that each atom of each element possessesthe memory of all his adventures in combination. Bythe way, that atom (fortified with that memory)would not be the same atom; yet it is, because it hasgained nothing from anywhere except this memory. Therefore, by the lapse of time, and by virtue ofmemory, a thing could become something more thanitself; thus a real development is possible. One canthen see a reason for any element deciding to gothrough this series of incarnations, because so, andonly so, can he go; and he suffers the lapse ofmemory which he has during these incarnations,because he knows he will come through un- changed.Therefore you can have an infinite number of gods,individual and equal though diverse, each one"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"supreme and utterly indestructible. This is also theonly explanation of how a \"Perfect Being\" couldcreate a world in which war, evil, etc., exist. God isonly an appearance, because (like \"good\") it cannotaffect the substance itself, but only multiply itscombinations. This is something the same as mysticmonotheism; but all parts of himself, so that theirinterplay is false. If we presuppose many elements,their interplay is natural.It is no objection to this theory to ask who made theelements—the elements are at least there, and God,when you look for him, is not there. Theism isobscurum per obscurius. A male star is built upfrom the centre outwards; a female from thecircumference inwards. This is what is meant whenwe say that woman has no soul. It explains fully thedifference between the sexes.The reader will understand that all this is purespeculative thinking, although on a much higherlevel than that of theologians. Theurgists have whatwe call \"religious experiences\" and some of them,very imprudently, deduce from such experiences anidea of \"God.\" From that moment on the theologian,that vermin of religion, is on \"safe\" ground. Atheologian does not criticize his or her religion'sidea of \"God;\" all their \"reasoning\" is amanipulation of dogma. As to the speculation abouthow male stars and female stars are built, it is sheernonsense. The star itself is omnisexual; it is theinstrument that becomes \"limited\" in this regard atbirth. This subject is thoroughly treated in EquinoxV 4, subtitled \"Sex and Religion.\" The idea that awoman has no \"soul\" is a purely Semitic idea; itsprings from the cultural attitude of Arabs and Jewstowards women. However, when one considers theutter docility with which Arabic women and Jewishwomen have for centuries acquiesced in theologiesthat insult and denigrate their sex, one wonders ifwoman does have, if not a soul, at least a brain.\"Obscurum per obscuris\" means, roughly, a falseargument based on a false premise, leading to moreconfusion that there was at the start.

Gerard Aumont's promised essay; itwas originally called \"The Three Schools of Magick.\" (Don't becross, please, because it is not in the form of a personal letter!)As previously stated, although Gerard Aumont did exist and wasa Crowley pupil for a while, this essay was written by Crowleyhimself as part of his campaign against Besant and Leadbeater.The White School and the Yellow are brilliantly described andcommented upon; the Black School, however, is not touched atall. The Black School of Magick is, of course, connected with theblack peoples of the Earth: Africans and Australasians. Directreference to it is made in AL I, 37, under African terminology.The reader will notice that in all three letters devoted to thislong essay Crowley does not treat of the real Black School atall. Instead, he does one of those manipulation jobs verycommon among Adepts, to take advantage of the connotationof \"Black\" with \"Evil\" in the mind of followers of the moredebased cults of humankind, and of the color prejudice againstblack people on the part of the average vulgar white - andyellow! — person. He was not here concerned with \"truth\" inthe normal sense. As he himself stated in his Commentary to"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Chapter 45 of Liber 333:The Master (in technical language, the Magus) doesnot concern himself with facts; he does not carewhether a thing is true or not: he uses truth andfalsehood indiscriminately, to serve his ends. Slavesconsider him immoral, and preach against him inHyde Park.This statement is neither true nor false. The point the readermust keep in mind is that all references to the \"Black School\"here made are highly imaginative, to put it mildly. Crowleywas in fact referring specifically to a sub-branch of the WhiteSchool, for the Hindus - the true Aryans! - are members of theWhite School, for all that their skin often looks blacker thanthat of a Negro. The confusion is made more confused byadding the Buddha to the story, for the Buddha was actually aYellow School member. But since the Theosophical Society,after falling in the clutches of two unworthy disciples of thedead Master, was trying to use religion to further the allegedpolitical interests of India and the actual financial interests ofmaharajas and \"maharishis\" and \"gurujis\" etc., etc., adnauseam. Crowley, indignant that they dared step on his turfand were actually playing dirty, played dirty as well — andmuch more successfully.You must not feel sympathy towards Annie Besant and heraccomplice: she did not really care for India itself at all: whatshe had in mind was power. She wanted India to becomeindependent of the British Empire, but to fall under herdomination. Her dream was to be the \"grey eminence\" behindthe throne, or the republic, or whatnot. And from anindependent India, how powerful would the TheosophicalSociety become! Why, as powerful as the Vatican, nay more!Think of it: Annie Besant, the White Popess of the Orient! ...In asense, almost a feminist dream. But very far from the Master,Blavatsky, a true feminist by the way.The Hindus, if you discount propaganda, are one of the mostcallous, stupid, selfish and cruel peoples in the world. In theirway, they are exactly as callous and selfish as that sub-culturalgroup called the Christists. Misery in India is terrible; theabsolute scorn for the rights in individuals who do not belongto the ruling gang and for the sufferings of the poor is dreadful.Here is a nation that has one of the biggest cattle herds in theentire world but where daily children die of starvation becausethe parents are vegetarians, and Hindus neither plant enough"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"nor control (surprise, surprise!) their sexual appetites. Onecould go on for hours speaking of the peoples of the Bengalpeninsula and detailing their psychology, politics, and materialreality, but it is useless to do so. The serious reader will findmore than enough testimony about them in works byintelligent Western visitors of that region; even Ms. ShirleyMcLaine, in her first autobiographical book of travels (not thesilly one about China) managed to draw an accurate portrait ofwhat is wrong with that zone. It should be interesting toponder that Christist countries, without the influence of the so—called \"Rosicrucians,\" of the Qabalist Jews of Maimonides,and of the Moors, would be exactly under the same plight.Yet, the influence of Besant and Leadbeater was sufficientlystrong in the West to provide the \"maharishis\" and \"secretHindu masters\" with enough of an entry, at least in the UnitedStates of America, that they not only became millionaires withthe greatest of ease, but are favorably received where aThelemite would be shunned and feared. In part this is due tothe relentless campaign of vengeance that the TheosophicalSociety, or at least that section of it under Besant andLeadbeater's influence, moved against Crowley (and continuemoving against Crowley) ever since. Interestingly enough, theVatican has taken enormous advantage of the Toshosophists'sas Crowley called them, hatred for Θελημα. It is not only theMagus who uses truth or falsehood indiscriminately for hisown purposes!This statement about the Magus, however, must be clearlyunderstood. Some things that seem to the average humanbeing to be eternal verites are actually quite false: they aredreams of the untrained mind, often derived from subconsciousimpulses of fear or greed. It is of this kind of thing that Crowleysaid that the Magus takes advantage to put his Law across.however, to go deeply into this matter would but confuse thereader, who not only would be unable to understand us, butvery likely would, which is worse, completely misinterpretwhat we said. Crowley was very right when he stated that truesecrets cannot be revealed (that's why they are secrets.) Unlessyou yourself have experience of the states of consciousness ofwhich it is being spoken, you will not understand what is beingspoken, no matter how clearly it is stated, or by whom.One last remark before we go into the Essay itself: precisely asreaders should be careful of the emotional connotations of\"Black\" that may exist in their minds when reading whatfollows, they should also be careful of the connotations of"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"\"White.\" What is \"white\" is not necessarily \"good\" or\"beautiful\" or \"just,\" it is merely white; and in the sensemeant by the essay, the word White refers to that racial groupof humankind that falls under the name of the \"white races.\"This includes not only Nordic and Caucasian, but also Semiteand Aryan groups, as well as the ancient Egyptians, wholooked copper-skinned rather than white. If you do not keepthis firmly in mind, it is unlikely that you will profit much fromthe reading of what follows; and what follows, to a mind thatkeeps its guard, is truly profitable reading. It will teach you alot about the White and Yellow Schools of Magick - althoughvery little about the Black!There is today much misunderstanding of the meaning of the term\"Magick.\" Many attempts have been made to define it, butperhaps the best for our present purpose of historical-ideological exposition will be this—Magick is the Science of theIncommensurables.This is one of the many restricted uses of the word; one suited tothe present purpose.It is particularly to be noted that Magick, so often mixed up in thepopular idea of a religion, has nothing to do with it. It is, in fact,the exact opposite of religion; it is, even more than PhysicalScience, its irreconcilable enemy.Which is why all religions attack us.Let us define this difference clearly. Magick investigates the lawsof Nature with the idea of making use of them. It only differsfrom \"profane\" science by always keeping ahead of it. As Fraserhas shown, Magick is science in the tentative stage; but it maybe, and often is, more than this. It is science which, for onereason or another, cannot be declared to the profane.This does not mean that those willing and able to do so cannotreproduce the experiments of the teacher, and verify his or herown conclusions for their own benefit. However, the stages ofconsciousness which compose spiritual progress areunintelligible and incommunicable to those who have notundergone the training necessary to experience them, or whoare constitutionally incapable of undergoing them.Religion, on the contrary, seeks to ignore the laws of Nature, or toescape them by appeal to a postulated power which is assumedto have laid them down. The religious man is, as such, incapableof understanding what the laws of Nature really are. (They aregeneralizations from the order of observed fact.)The History of Magick has never been seriously attempted. ..."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"All those \"histories of Magic\" written so far, including Levi's, areeither sketchy, misleading, downright false, or sectarian....

But Magick has led the world from before the beginningof history, if only for the reason that Magick has always been themother of Science. It is, therefore, of extreme importance thatsome effort should be made to understand something of thesubject; and there is, therefore, no apology necessary foressaying this brief outline of its historical aspects.There have always been, at least in nucleus, three main Schools ofPhilosophical practice. (We use the word \"philosophical\" in theold good broad sense, as in the phrase \"PhilosophicalTransactions of the Royal Society for the Advancement ofKnowledge.\")The word \"philosophy\" is from the Greek, and actually means\"love of wisdom.\"It is customary to describe these three Schools as Yellow, Black,and White.

It is this significance, and only this significance,that possesses any philosophical value to the Initiate.The orthodox need not be shocked, and the enlightened need notbe contemptuous, to learn that the passage which we are aboutto quote, is a parable based on the least decorous of the Biblicallegends which refer to Noah. It simply captures for its ownpurposes the convenience of Scripture...Not so: this is the true legend, or rather initiatic fable, of whichthe Bible version is a corruption and falsification, perhapsunintended; for each of us can only see or hear or understandas far as we are capable. Notice the reference to the\"indecorous\" nature of the fable: he is apologizing beforehandto the prejudice of the people who forbade the reading of theBible lest its franker passages corrupt or disillusion the faithful.From the point of view of a modern teenager, the whole storyis quite innocent; but it was not innocent to orthodox Jews,who to this day copulate in darkness, since the sight of thenaked human body is wicked! Those, incidentally, are the kindof people who trained the adolescent Menachem Begin tomurder women, children, and fellow Jews — and as \"reward\"for his murders elected him \"Prime Minister of Israel\" in his oldage.(Here follows the excerpt from the Vision.)And a voice cries: Cursed be he that shall uncover thenakedness of the Most High, for he is drunken uponthe wine that is the blood of the adepts. ..."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"That is, he is a Magus, although not necessarily theMagus of the Aeon in which he lives.\"... And BABALON hath lulled him to sleep upon herbreast, and she hath fled away, and left him naked,and she hath called her children together saying:Come up with me, and let us make a mock of thenakedness of the Most High...In a sense, the perception of the nakedness means theperception of the limitations or inadequaciesinherent in the Law extant at the time when theadepts first perceive that their \"father\" is \"naked,\"that is, that the extant Law is inadequate. You mustrealize that no law, on any level or any sense, isinadequate until someone perceives it is, and provesit!... And the first of the adepts covered His shame with acloth, walking backwards, and was white. And thesecond of the adepts covered his shame with a cloth,walking sideways, and was yellow. And the third ofthe adepts made a mock of His nakedness, walkingforward, and was black ...\"Now, this has absolutely nothing to do with the RacialStrains of magick; rather with the attitude withwhich the Adepts react to the previous Law, nowfound insufficient or inadequate. The \"White\" so-called perceive it is inadequate, but react as if itweren't, disguising its insufficiency and acting as ifthat Law were valuable: they walk backwards fromit, paying it homage in the old style of courtierstowards a king or emperor. The \"Yellow\" perceiveits inadequacy and conceal it; but they no longerobey that law; they walk sideways from it. The\"Black\" advance and expose its inadequacy, andridicule it.

Have you ever seen a\"maharishi\" denounce established cults or speakagainst whatever knaves may be \"rulers\" ofwhatever country the \"maharishi\" makes hismillions in...?

We must, however, enter acaveat against too literal an interpretation, even ofthe parable. It may be suspected, for reasons whichshould be apparent after further investigation of thedoctrines of the Three Schools, that this parable wasinvented by an Intelligence of the Black School, whowas aware of his iniquity, and thought to transformit into righteousness by the alchemy of making aboast of it ...By the above interpretation we can see how farCrowley was from perception of AL III when hewrote this. The Intelligence who was telling theparable was not taking sides at all: It was merelystating that whatever adept, or whatever School ofAdepts, mocked or criticized the \"Establishment\"was considered \"black,\" that is to say, \"evil.\" But cf.AL, I 21, 28-31, 49, 52-56, 60; II, 5, 14, 23, 52; III, 19,43-45, 54.... The intelligent reader will note the insidious attemptto identify the doctrine of the Black School with thekind of black magic that is commonly calledDiabolism. In other words, this parable is itself anexample of an exceedingly subtle black magicaloperation, and the contemplation of such devicescarried far enough beings us to an understanding ofthe astoundingly ophidian processes of Magicians ...Now, here he is mocking the foolish reader, andwarning the wise not to take him too seriously, yettake him seriously enough.

Being itself apart of thatUniverse, it realizes its impotence to alter thetotality in the smallest degree. To put it vulgarly, itdoes not try to raise itself from the ground by pullingat its socks. It therefore opposes to the current ofphenomena no reaction either of hatred or ofsympathy. So far as it attempts to influence thecourse of events at all, it does so in the onlyintelligent way conceivable. It seeks to diminishinternal friction.It remains, therefore, in a contemplative attitude. Touse the terms of Western philosophy, there is in itsattitude something of the stoicism of Zeno; or of thePickwickianism, if I may use the term, of Epicurus. The ideal reaction to phenomena is that of perfectelasticity. It possesses something of the cold-bloodedness of mathematics; and for this reason itseems fair to say, for the purposes of elementarystudy, that Pythagoras is its most adequate exponentin European philosophy."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Since the discovery of Asiatic thought, however, wehave no need to take our ideas at second-hand.

Not onlyis religion as such repugnant to science andphilosophy, but from the very nature of the tenets ofthe Yellow School, its adherents are not going to putthemselves to any inconvenience for theenlightenment of a lot of people whom they considerto be hopeless fools.At the same time, the theory of religion, as such, beinga tissue of falsehood, the only real strength of anyreligion is derived from its pilferings of Magicaldoctrine; and, religious persons being by defini- tionentirely unscrupulous, it follows that any givenreligion is likely to contain scraps of Magicaldoctrine, filched more or less haphazard from oneschool or the other as occasion serves.Let the reader, therefore, beware most seriously oftrying to get a grasp of this subject by means of sirenanalogies.

Consider it an exercisein listening to political speeches!..., is distinguished fundamentally from the YellowSchool in that it considers the Universe not asneutral, but as definitely a curse. Its primarytheorem is the \"First Noble Truth\" of the Buddha—\"Everything is Sorrow.\" In the primitive classics ofthis School the idea of sorrow is confused with thatof sin ...This absolutely was not the intention of the Buddhawhen he spoke: he merely stated a fact; the \"moral\"implications given to that fact were the result ofvehicular indiscipline on the part of followersunable to face the Master and listen to the \"Secret\"He spoke.(This idea of universal lamentation is presumablyresponsible for the choice of black as its symboliccolour. And yet? Is not white the Chinese hue ofmourning?)This parenthesis is a broad hint to the intelligentreader.The analysis of the philosophers of this School refersevery phenomenon to the category of sorrow. It isquite useless to point out to them that certain eventsare accompanied with joy: they continue theirruthless calculations, and prove to your satisfaction,or rather dissatisfaction, that the more apparentlypleasant an event is, the more malignantly deceptiveis its fascination. There is only one way of escapeeven conceivable, and this way is quite simple,annihilation. (Shallow critics of Buddhism havewasted a great deal of stupid ingenuity on trying tomake out that Nirvana or Nibbana means somethingdifferent from what etymology, tradition and theevidence of the Classics combine to define it. Theword means, quite simply, cessation: and it stands toreason that, if everything is sorrow, the only thingwhich is not sorrow is nothing, and that therefore to"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"escape from sorrow is the attainment ofnothingness.)This attack on Buddhism is the more incisive becauseCrowley had been a very orthodox Buddhist prior tothe Dictation of The Book of the Law.Nevertheless, there are two things wrong with it.First, what the Buddha mean by 'annihilation' wasthe result of the Trance Nerodah-Sammapatti,which roughly corresponds to the SamadhiShivadarshana, which Crowley himself admits is ahigher state of Samadhi than Atmadarshana. TheBuddha preached detachment from the illusion ofexistence, not extinction of existence. His followerswere not encouraged to commit suicide, but to reacha higher level of perception than that of the mass ofhumankind, slave of circumstances.The second wrong this is that the 'Toshosophy' ofBesant and Leadbeater has nothing at all to do withserious Buddhism of any sort. It is rather a debasedform of Brahmanism mixed up with absurd legends.There are certain \"secret masters\" who are alwaysquite mysterious, quite inaccessible, but extremelypowerful, devotion to whom - and lots of moneypaid to the representatives of — will ensure the'faithful' all kinds of fantastic powers or privilegesor advantages. The Besant-Leadbeater pantheonincludes not only Morya and Koot Hoomi,Blavatsky's supposed gurus, but a medley oflegendary figures from all times: the \"MasterJesus,\" the \"Master Racoczy,\" the \"MasterHilarion,\" the \"Master Maitreya,\" etc., etc. Theanalogy with the \"saints\" of Roman Catholicism isflagrant; the main difference is that, although thereare female \"saints\" in the Roman Catholic pantheon,Leadbeater's homosexuality precluded any in theToshosophic. The \"theosophy\" of Besant andLeadbeater is a black magical operation attemptedalong the very same lines as Christism, and wouldprobably have been as \"successful\" as Christism hadCrowley not intervened. But Buddhism itself ismerely a branch of the Yellow School, and as weobserved before, the real Black School of Magick,the School of the Black Race, is not touched upon inCrowley's essay."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Western philosophy has on occasion approached thisdoctrine. It has at least asserted that no known formof existence is exempt from sorrow. Huxley says, inhis Evolution and Ethics, \"Suffering is the badge ofall the tribe of sentient things.\"Not Aldous Huxley the writer, but his grandfather, thegreat biologist and stylist Thomas Henry Huxley,the first respected scientist to publicly defend andaccept Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution inEngland.The philosophers of this School, seeking, naturallyenough, to amend the evil at the root, inquire intothe cause of this existence which is sorrow, andarrive immediately at the \"Second Noble Truth\" ofthe Buddha: \"The Cause of Sorrow is Desire.\" Theyfollow up with the endless concatenation of causes,of which the final root is Ignorance. (I am notconcerned to defend the logic of this School: I merelystate their doctrine.) The practical issue of all this isthat every kind of action is both unavoidable and acrime. I must digress to explain that the confusion ofthought in this doctrine is constantly recurrent. Thatis part of the blackness of the Ignorance which theyconfess to be the foundation of their Universe. (Andafter all, everyone has surely the right to have hisown Universe the way he wants it.)It is extremely unlikely that the true thought of theBuddha is represented in Buddhism any more thanthe true thought of Dionysus is represented inChristism or, alas! the true thought of Crowley willrepresented in Crowleyanity a hundred years fromnow.

Most primitive fetishistic religions may, in fact, beconsidered fairly faithful representatives of thisphilosophy. Where animism holds sway, the\"medicine-man\" personifies this universal evil, andseeks to propitiate it by human sacrifice. The earlyforms of Judaism, and that type of Christianity whichwe associate with the Salvation Army, Billy Sundayand the Fundamentalists of the back-blocks ofAmerica, are sufficiently simple cases of religionwhose essence is the propitiation of a malignantdemon.Any form of Christism is such propitiation: the NiceneCreed postulates it. We refer the reader to Letterto a Brasilian Mason on this subject.When the light of intelligence begins to dawn dimlythrough many fogs upon these savages, we reach asecond stage. Bold spirits master courage to assertthat the evil which is so obvious, is, in somemysterious way, an illusion. They thus throw backthe whole complexity of sorrow to a single cause;that is, the arising of the illusion aforesaid. Theproblem then assumes a final form: How is thatillusion to be destroyed.A very wicked thing, to go against Deity like this.Why, if \"God\" had meant man to fly, \"he\" wouldhave given them wings.

It is a characteristicof religions started and maintained by BlackBrothers that heretics are not to be permitted.\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,\" etc. etc.A fairly pure example of the first stage of this type ofthought is to be found in the Vedas; of the secondstage, in the Upanishads ...You will notice that nothing of this has anything to dowith Buddhism or the Buddha; his main intention inthe essay is to discredit anything that comes from"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"the Orient, with the single exception of Chinesephilosophy. This was due to the fact that Besant andLeadbeater hid the miasma of the conmanshipbehind a medley of Hindu and pseudo-Buddhisticlore. Their \"Hidden Masters\" lived somewhere in avague region of the East that kept jumping all overthe Bengal Peninsula, Tibet, and sometimes even theGobi desert: \"Shambalah,\" where the \"gods\" live -that kind of thing. The modern reader may notrealize how this whole mystification was popular ata time not so long ago. James Hilton's verysuccessful, and very commonplace, novel LostHorizons was inspired by it, although his Shangri-La was, of course, his own creation even in thename. How it must have annoyed the Toshosophiststhat he did not use the term \"Shamabalah\"... Butperhaps they would have protested against it; theywere, and are, stupid enough to. Meanwhile, theMaster Blavatsky's true intention, which was aweakening of the fanaticism of the Christiststranglehold on the West, was going down the drainuntil Crowley picked it up and carried it on.... But the answer to the question, \"How is the illusionof evil to be destroyed?\", depends on another pointof theory. We may postulate a Parabrahm infinitelygood, etc. etc. etc., in which case we consider thedestruction of the illusion of evil as the reuniting ofthe consciousness with Parabrahm. The unfortunatepart of this scheme of things is that on seeking todefine Parabrahm for the purpose of returning to Itspurity, it is discovered sooner or later, that Itpossesses no qualities at all! In other words, as thefarmer said, on being shown the elephant: There ain'tno sich animile. It was Gautama Buddha whoperceived the inutility of dragging in this imaginarypachyderm. Since our Parabrahm, he said to theHindu philosophers, is actually nothing, why notstick to or original perception that everything issorrow, and admit that the only way to escape fromsorrow is to arrive at nothingness?We may complete the whole tradition of the Indianpeninsula very simply.

Paradoxical as it may soundthe Tantrics are in reality the most advanced of theHindus ...Madame Blavatsky used Tantrism very discreetly, andone of her followers, Sir John Woodroffe (\"ArthurAvalon\"), translated many important Tantric textsinto English. The reaction of Anglicanism andRoman Catholicism, to say nothing of the otherChristist sects, against it was extremely sharp, andBesant and Leadbeater abandoned the whole effort:Who wants to make money out of \"religion\" neverattacks the status quo.... Their theory is, in its philosophical ultimatum, aprimitive stage of the White tradition ...The reader is again reminded that although ourSchool is indeed the White School from a racialpoint of view it is the School called \"black\" in theInitiated Apologue quoted from The Vision andthe Voice, at least at present.... for the essence of the Tantric cults is that by theperformance of certain rites of Magick, one does notonly escape disaster, but obtains positivebenediction. The Tantric is not obsessed by the will-to-die. It is a difficult business, no doubt, to get anyfun out of existence; but at least it is not impossible. In other words, he implicitly denies the fundamentalproposition that existence is sorrow, and heformulates the essential postulate of the WhiteSchool of Magick, that means exist by which theuniversal sorrow (apparent indeed to all ordinaryobservation) may be unmasked, even as at theinitiatory rite of Isis in the ancient days of Khem.

At last you surely come to God.The poem is, of course, by Crowley himself.There is thus in this School no attempt to deny thatNature is, as Zoroaster said, \"a fatal and evil force\";but Nature is, so to speak, \"the First Matter of theWork\", which is to be transmuted into gold. The joyis a function of our own part in this alchemy. Forthis reason we find the boldest and most skillfuladepts deliberately seeking out the most repugnantelements of Nature that their triumph may be thegreater. The formula is evidently one of dauntlesscourage. It expresses the idea of vitality andmanhood in its most dynamic sense.The only religion which corresponds to this School atall is that of ancient Egypt; possibly also that ofChaldea. This is because those religions are Magicalreligions in the strict technical sense; the religiouscomponent of them is negligible. So far as it exists,it exists only for the uninitiate.There are, however, traces of the beginning of theinfluence of the School in Judaism and in Paganism. There are, too, certain documents of the pure Greekspirit which bear traces of this. It is what they calledTheurgy.The Christian religion in its simplest essence, by thatidea of overcoming evil through a Magical ceremony,the Crucifixion, seems at first sight a fair example ofthe White tradition; but the idea of sin and ofpropitiation tainted it abominably with Blackness. There have been, however, certain Christian thinkerswho have taken the bold logical step of regarding evilas a device of God for exercising the joys of combatand victory. This is, of course, a perfectly Whitedoctrine; but it is regarded as the most dangerous ofheresies. (Romans VI. 1,2, et al.)For all that, the idea is there ...But the idea is not Thelemic at all, on the contrary.There is no \"evil\" in the doctrine of The Book ofthe Law.... The Mass itself is essentially a typical White ritual. Its purpose is to transform crude matter directly"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"into Godhead. It is thus a cardinal operation ofTalismanic Magick. But the influence of the BlackSchool has corroded the idea with theologicalaccretions, metaphysical on the one hand, andsuperstitious on the other, so completely as to maskthe Truth altogether.Now this, of course, is altogether incorrect. The BlackSchool as he interprets it in the essay, meaning theHindus and the Buddhists, had absolutely noinfluence on the corruption of the Gnostic Ritual ofthe Mass at the hands of the Christists. He isdeliberately equating the \"Black School\" with theBlack Lodge and the Black Brothers, to takeadvantage of the emotional connotations of thecolor \"black\" in the average Western mind. He willget to Besant and Leadbeater eventually, as youwill see, after having thoroughly confused the issuefor his own purpose, which, we remind the reader,was to discredit the Toshosophists and Eastern\"maharishis\" and \"gurujis\" in general and topropagandize Θελημα as he then understood it.At the Reformation, we find a nugatory attempt toremove the Black element. The Protestant thinkersdid their best to get rid of the idea of sin, but it wassoon seen that the effort could only lead toantinomianism; and they recognized that this wouldinfallibly destroy the religious idea as such.Antinomianism is the Christist theological conceptthat \"faith\" alone is sufficient to ensure \"salvation.\"This does away with the \"Devil,\" with \"Jesus\" and,what was more serious, with the need for priests,pastors, or organized churches...!Mysticism, both Catholic and Protestant, made afurther attempt to free Christianity from the darkcloud of iniquity. They joined hands with the Sufisand the Vedantists. But this again led to the meredenial of the reality of evil. Thus drawing away, littleby little, from clear appreciation of the facts ofNature, their doctrine became purely theoretical,and faded away, while the thundercloud of sin settleddown more heavily than ever.This reference can only be understood if you study thehistory of the ecumenical movement of the late"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Nineteenth Century, with the creation of the WorldCouncil of Religions, at which Vivekananda madesuch a strong showing.

Fromthe point of view of the Jerry Falwells and PhyllisSchlaflys and the Popes, it is utter disaster,especially to their purses.The most important of all the efforts of the WhiteSchool, from an exoteric point of view, is Islam. Inits doctrine there is some slight taint, but much lessthan in Christianity. It is a virile religion. It looksfacts in the face, and admits their horror; but itproposes to overcome them by sheer dint ofmanhood. Unfortunately, the metaphysicalconceptions of its quasi-profane Schools are grosslymaterialistic. It is only the Pantheism of the Sufiswhich eliminates the conception of propitiation; and,in practice, the Sufis are too closely allied to theVedantists to retain hold of reality.Again, this is deliberately incorrect.That will be all for the present.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally,666LETTER EIGHT: THE THREESCHOOLS OF MAGICK (3)Cara Soror:Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.It has been a long—I hope not too tedious—voyage; butat last the harbour is in sight.Our Essay approaches its goal; the theory of Life towhich initiation tends.He means Thelemic initiation."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Let us continue!The above paragraphs were cut out by Mr. Regardiein his \"edition\" of this book. Perhaps he thought thedefinition of the Essay's goal too threatening tohimself and his cronies.There is in history only one movement whose objecthas been to organize the isolated adepts of the WhiteSchool of Magick, and this movement was totallyunconnected with religion, except in so far as it lentits influence to the reformers of the Christianchurch. Its appeal was not at all to the people. Itmerely offered to open up relations with, andcommunicate certain practical secrets of wisdom to,isolated men of science through Europe. Thismovement is generally known by the name ofRosicrucianism.The word arouses all sorts of regrettablecorrespondences; but the adepts of the Society havenever worried themselves in the least about theabuse of their name for the purposes ofcharlatanism, or about the attacks directed againstthem by envious critics. Indeed, so wisely have theyconcealed their activities that some modern scholarsof the shallower type have declared that no suchmovement ever existed, that it was a kind ofpractical joke played upon the curiosity of thecredulous Middle Ages. It is at least certain that,since the original proclamations, no officialpublications have been put forward. The essentialsecrets have been maintained inviolate. If, duringthe last few years, a considerable number ofdocuments have been published by them, though notin their name, it is on account of the impending crisisto civilization, of which mention will later be made.There is no good purpose, even were there license, todiscuss the nature of the basis of scientificattainment which is the core of the doctrines of theSociety. It is only necessary to point out that itscorrespondence with alchemy is the one genuine facton the subject which has been allowed to transpire;for the Rosicrucian, as indicated by his centralsymbol, the barren cross on which he has made arose to flower, occupies himself primarily withspiritual and physiological alchemy.

The task, however tedious, has beennecessary in order to explain with reasonablelucidity their connection with the world which theirideas direct; that is to say, the nature of theirpolitical activities.The Yellow School, in accordance with its doctrine ofperfectly elastic reaction and non-interference, holdsitself, generally speaking, entirely apart from all suchquestions. We can hardly imagine it sufficientlyinterested in any events soever to react aggressively. It feels strong enough to deal satisfactorily withanything that may turn up: and generally speaking, itfeels that any conceivable action on its part would belikely to increase rather than to diminish themischief.It remains somewhat contemptuously aloof from theeternal conflict of the Black School with the White ...This is again totally incorrect: the Black School ofMagick, the racial School, does not conflict with theWhite School; and the White School happens, by theterms of the Apologue, to be the \"Black School\" thisAeon.

At the same time, there is a certain feeling amongthe Yellow adepts that should either of these Schoolsbecome annihilated, the result might well be that thevictor would sooner or later turn his released energyagainst themselves.Since the Black Lodge and the Black Brothers areessentially diseased, should they triumph theywould certainly spread infection all over the planet.But since for certain reasons this is impossible,Crowley's description of the technique of the YellowSchool is more imaginative than factual. Pleasenotice that the Schools intermingle and exchangeknowledge at need and at random, and that the\"Rosicrucians\" just described were a branch of theWhite School using Yellow School methods in theirmagickal operation. They were, by the way, themost successful White School organization in knownhistory since Ancient Egypt.In accordance, therefore, with their general plan ofnon-action, as expressed in the Tao Teh King, ofdealing with mischief before it has become toostrong to be dangerous, they interfere gently fromtime to time to redress the balance.During the last two generations the Masters of theYellow School have been compelled to take notice ofthe progressive ruin of the White adepts. Christianity, which possessed at least the semblanceof a White formula, is in the agonies ofdecomposition, even before it is actually dead. Materialistic science has overwhelmed the faith andhope of the Christians (they never possessed anycharity to overwhelm) with a demonstration of thesorrow, transitoriness and cruel futility of theUniverse. A vast wave of pessimism has engulfed thefortress of Mansoul.It was indeed a deadly blow to the adepts of the WhiteSchool when Science, their own familiar friend inwhom they trusted, lifted up his heel against them ...All this is specious, all this part of the projected attackon Besant, Leadbeater and the Toshosophists.Science was the weapon the Rosicrucians wielded todestroy the tyranny of the Roman Church, and the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"stimulation of scientific thought has been the specialprovince of the White School of Magick for manycenturies....

It is true that Blavatsky, likeCrowley himself, went to Asia for training, but shewas a White Adept (read \"Black...!\"), and her workwas obviously along the techniques and aims of theWhite School. The main reason why Crowley statesshe was sent by the Yellow School is that Blavatskyclaimed that her Masters were Oriental: he is tryingto dissociate Blavatsky and her Masters completelyfrom what he calls the \"Black School,\" which, as wewill soon see, means especially Besant andLeadbeater in this essay, with their gambit of\"Secret Masters.\" Please notice that Besant andLeadbeater, although failing in their special conbecause of Crowley's intervention, at least openedthe door to any charlatan \"maharishi\" or \"guruji\" inthe West.

They, in conjunction withthe Secret Chiefs of the White School in Europe,Chiefs who had been compelled to suspend allattempts at exoteric enlightenment by the generalmoral debility which had overtaken the races fromwhich they drew their adepts, have prepared a guidefor mankind. This man, of an extreme moral forceand elevation, combined with a profound sense ofworldly realities, has stood forth in an attempt tosave the White School, to rehabilitate its formula,and to fling back from the bastions of moral freedomthe howling savages of pessimism.

It is summarizedin the four words, \"Do what thou wilt.\"It should not be necessary to explain that a fullappreciation of this message is not to be obtained bya hasty examination. It is essential to study it fromevery point of view, to analyse it with the keenestphilosophical acumen, and finally to apply it as a keyfor every problem, internal and external, that exists. This key, applied with skill, will open every lock.From the deepest point of view, the greatest value ofthis formula is that it affords, for the first time inhistory, a basis of reconciliation between the threegreat Schools of Magick. It will tend to appease theeternal conflict by understanding that each type ofthought shall go on its own way, develop its ownproper qualities without seeking to inter- fere withother formulae, however (superficially) opposed toits own.What is true for every School is equally true for everyindividual. Success in life, on the basis of the Law ofΘελημα, implies severe self-discipline. Each beingmust progress, as biology teaches, by strictadaptation to the conditions of the organism. If, asthe Black School continually asserts, the cause ofsorrow is desire, we can still escape the conclusionby the Law of Θελημα. What is necessary is not toseek after some fantastic ideal, utterly unsuited toour real needs, but to discover the true nature ofthose needs, to fulfill them, and rejoice therein.This process is what is really meant by initiation; thatis to say, the going into oneself, and making one'speace, so to speak, with all the forces that one findsthere.It is forbidden here to discuss the nature of The Bookof the Law, the Sacred Scripture of Θελημα.

There are facts and facts:one would not necessarily be much the wiser if onegot the Encyclopaedia Britannica by heart, or theTables of Logarithms.

They held to the Platonic dogma ofarchetypes. They maintained that there was anoriginal (divine) idea such as \"greenness\" or a \"pig,\"and that a green pig, as observed in nature, was justone example of these two ideal essences. They wereopposed by the \"nominalists,\" who said, to thecontrary, that \"greenness\" or \"a pig\" were nothing inthemselves; they were mere names (nominalismfrom Lat. nomen, a name) invented for convenienceof grouping. This doctrine is plain commonsense,and I shall waste no time in demolishing the realists.You will notice that the \"realists,\" as they calledthemselves, were indeed the \"idealists\" to end all\"idealists,\" and the fact that they were able to callthemselves by a term that meant exactly theopposite of what they were explains Crowley'sthousand adjectives and reminds one of the\"democracy\" of Reagan and the \"morality\" ofFalwell, to say nothing of the \"feminism\" of Schlaflyand the \"Christianity\" of the Popes.

But we must not trust any such theorem; it is littlemore than a hint to help us in our guesses. Example:an angel appears and tells us that his name isMALIEL (MLIAL) which adds to 111, the third of thenumbers of the Sun. Do we conclude that his natureis solar? In this case, yes, perhaps, because, (on thetheory) he took that name for the very reason that itchimed with his nature.

Indeed, it was introduced by theToshosophists under the influence of homosexualHindu \"masters\".

Vivekananda's Master,Ramakrishna, had a woman as his instructor; onedoes not consider that Vivekananda was lackingbecause of that. \"Left-hand Path\" meant the leftspinal cord channel, the Ida; and \"Right-hand Path\"meant the right spinal chord channel, the Pingala.The so-called 'Teachers' who introduced thenomenclature considered that if a man went to bedwith another man they would both cultivate thePositive, or Solar Current, which runs throughPingala, while if a man went to bed with a womanhe would cultivate the Negative, or Lunar Current,which runs through Ida. However, it so happensthat the polarity is reversed in the female: the Solarcurrent runs through Ida, and the Lunar currentthrough Pingala! So here, you see, we have the kindof situation that would delight medievaltheologians in search of a human barbecue. TheTantrists — those infamous heterosexuals! — wereskillfully slandered by Besant and Leadbeater'sfaggotty \"gurus,\" who wanted no competition, andespecially no competition from people vile enoughto go to bed with women.

But it is true that with regard to the O.T.O.there is no similar manual of instruction. In theManifesto, and other Official Pronunciamenti, thereare, it is true, what ought to be adequate data; but Iquite understand that they are not as ordered andclassified as one would wish; there is certainly roomfor a simple elementary account of the origins of the"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Order, of its principles, of its methods, of its design,of the Virtue of its successive Grades. This I will nowtry to supply, at least in a brief outline.Let us begin at the beginning. What is a DramaticRitual? It is a celebration of the Adventures of theGod whom it is intended to invoke. (The Bacchae ofEuripides is a perfect example of this.) Now, in theO.T.O., the object of the ceremonies being theInitiation of the Candidate, it is he whose Path inEternity is displayed in dramatic form.What is the Path?1. The Ego is attracted to the Solar System.2. The Child experiences Birth.3. The Man experiences Life.4. He experiences Death.5. He experiences the World beyond Death.6. This entire cycle of Point-Events is withdrawninto Annihilation.In the O.T.O. these successive stages are represented asfollows:—10°(Minerval)2I°(Initiation)3II°(Consecration)4III°(Devotion)5IV°(Perfection, orExaltation)6P.I.(Perfect Initiate)Of these Events of Stations upon the Path all but 3 (II°)are single critical experiences. We, however, areconcerned mostly with the very varied experiences ofLife.All subsequent Degrees of the O.T.O. are accordinglyelaborations of the II°, since in a single ceremony itis hardly possible to sketch, even in the briefestoutline, the Teaching of Initiates with regard to Life. The Rituals V°–IX° are then instructions to theCandidate how he should conduct himself; and theyconfer upon him, gradually, the Magical Secretswhich make him Master of Life.Mr. Israel Regardie, in his \"edition, \" cut off thepreceding three paragraphs, obviously because they"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"make it very clear that Crowley would never havecondoned the publication of the O.T.O. rituals doneby thieves with whom Mr. Regardie always was incontact and whom Mr. Regardie encouraged,abetted, and - as we can plainly see - imitated.Furthermore, some of Crowley's remarks in thoseparagraphs must have hit Mr. Regardie too close tothe flesh to be comfortable. The Rituals of the O.T.O.have been changed, of course, and will never againbe made public by thieves. It is interesting to notethat in his piracy Mr. Francis \"King \" did not includethe Rituals above the VI°, stating that there are \"norituals for those Grades.\" Of course there are; theysimply did not fall into his thieving hands becausethose who delivered the rituals to this butcherynever had them, having no right to the Grades.Since these are the only O.T.O. Rituals that were notexposed, they have been kept, by decision of theO.H.O. The pirated rituals are being used, as it wasintended by the thieves who published them, bytotally unworthy individuals in several countries.Those rituals are no longer valid, and personsundergoing 'initiation' under them are requested towrite to us immediately, informing us of thisinfringement on the rights and name of the O.T.O.Persons authorized to represent the O.T.O. willalways be able to exhibit patents. But since manyhave been expelled for dishonesty or laxity, it ispossible that patents are being exhibited that are nolonger valid. For instance, a member who has notpaid dues for more than three months isautomatically out of the Order.

We find supposedly feministgroups trying to ban pornography and even girliephotos in magazines, without taking the trouble tofind out whether the women who participate inthose enterprises enjoy them, and want toparticipate in them, or are compelled by force to doso, which seems unlikely.

Feminism is not hatred of men, anunfortunate by-product of it, is being used toinfluence feminists as a whole to avoid the male, orsexual activity with the male, except in terms that, ifyou look carefully upon them, differ from the oldstandards only because of a reversal of roles.

I have often been looked upon as asex object, happily sometimes by women, and Ienjoyed the proceedings in bed well enough, with nostrings attached. The emphasis on not beingregarded as \"sex objects\" is merely another attemptof the enemy to lead women back into servitude. Itis very natural that a woman should not want to beregarded only as a sex object; but if this happenswith a man whom you find sexy enough for onenight, but not a man you would want to spend yourentire existence with, so what? Unfortunately, thissubject is too complex to go into at length here.Feminists should beware of any tendencies torestrict their sexual life out of \"respect\" for artificialstandards of \"dignity,\" or abstract concepts of whatbeing a feminist is.

In his oldage, Crowley was a Master of the Temple AND aMagus AND an Ipsissimus: the subsets of his Beingwere distant, often quaint, curiosities to him.

There are two.β: To train the mind to move with themaximum speed and energy, with theutmost possible accuracy in the chosendirection, and with the minimum ofdisturbance or friction. That is Magick.α: To stop the mind altogether. That isYoga.The rules, strangely enough, are identical in both cases;at least, until your \"Magick\" is perfect; Yoga merelygoes on a step further.

Incidentally, during WorldWar II, Kipling's \"If\" was found framed in the officeor home of the great majority of working Britons.This, of course, does not include the intelligentsia,who never work anywhere, just play. The poet hadbeen in disgrace for several years already, and it isinteresting that he should have surfaced, in this onepoem at least, despite the loud complaints of thecritics, at one of the most difficult times in thehistory of England. After the conflict, theintelligentsia again managed to banish him fromthe minds of his countrymen, with the beautifulresults that are so evident at the present time andwhich Crowley, incidentally, had foreseen in hisprophetic poem, Carmen Saeculare, decades before:The harlot that men called greatBabylon,In crimson raiment and in smoothattire,The scarlet leprosy that shamed thesun,The gilded goat that piled the worldfor hire; -Her days of wealth and majesty aredone:Men trample her for mire!The temple of the God is brokendown;Yes, Mammon's shine is cleansed!The house of herThat cowed the world with hermalignant frown,And drove the Celt to exile anddespair,"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Is battered now — God's fire destroysthe town;London admits God's air.This was written forty-five years before London wasrazed by the Nazi raids.

Back came theanswer: \"within a few minutes of eleven. Iremember because your father had hung on as longas he could—he had to take the morning service.\"This occurrence is very common in my experience; Ihave contradicted what sounded like ascertained factand proved on enquiry to have been right; so,considering that the statistics I made many years agoshowed me to have been right 109 times out of 120, Ithink two things are fairly near probation; firstly, Iam not guessing—that doesn't matter much; but,secondly, which is of supreme importance, there is adefinite connection between the personal appearanceand manner of the native, and the Sign of the Zodiacwhich was rising when he first drew air into hislungs.Let me add, to strengthen the argument, that on thefew occasions where I have erred there has been agood astrological reason for it. Exempli gratia, Imight plump for Pisces rising when it was actuallyCapricornus; but in that case Saturn would have beenafflicted by being in Cancer, with bad aspects fromVenus and the Moon, thus taking away all his rugged,male, laborious qualities, and in the Ascendant mighthave been Jupiter, suggesting many of the qualitiesof Pisces: and so forth.Now let me start! You want me to explain the system—or no-system!—which I use. I do not \"move in amysterious way My wonders to perform;\" fornothing could be simpler. For its origin I have tothank Abramelin the Mage, who empties the vials ofhis scorn upon the astrologers of his time with theirmeticulous calculations of \"the hours of the planets\"and so on.

They compare and contrast until they are inbat-eyed bewilderment bemused; and when theanswer turns out absolutely false, exclaim, what ashout: \"By Ptolemy, I forgot to look at the lastLuniation for Buda-Pesth!\" But then they canalways find something or other which will explainhow they came to go wrong: naturally, when youhave several hundred factors, helplessly bound andgagged, it would be just too bad if you couldn't pickout one to serve your turn—after the event! No, deargirl, it should be obvious to an unweaned brat:(a) they can't see the wood for the trees,(b) they are using Ruach on a proposition whichdemands Neschamah. Intellect is quite inadequate;the problem requires mother-wit, intuition,understanding.This is the main reason why Astrology is so erraticthat it cannot be called a science; it is an art. Thepeople who write for The Skeptical Inquirer,which we reviewed in Book Four CommentedPart I, subtitled \"Yoga and Magick,\" periodicallyhave kittens over astrologers and Astrology. Theyhave proved again and again that it doesn't work;and can attribute the stubborn popularity of thesubject with the general public to nothing else butstupidity and escapism. Well, it is not necessarily so,or not always so; unfortunately for official science,once in a while someone comes along who practicesAstrology from a Neschamic level, sometimeswithout even realizing it; and such a personachieves a reasonable efficiency of prediction, sayslightly above fifty/fifty; word-of-mouth does therest. Kepler was an astrologer; he is called anastronomer merely because the scientificestablishment decided to adopt him — after Kepler's"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"law, what else could they do...? But Kepler made agood living as an astrologer, and is reputed to havebeen remarkably accurate in his predictions. So wasCrowley. The O.T.O. has finally been able toreconstitute his work on Astrology. It covers overfour hundred brilliant pages, and we will publish itas soon as we can afford to.Here is my system in a Number 000 Ampoule.Meaning, in very few words.Put up the figure at birth: study it, make notes of theaspects and dignities, concentrate—and turn on theMagical Tap!Occasionally, when I began, I set up the \"progressedfigure\" to see how the patient was doing this week,but it never seemed to help enough to compensatefor the distraction caused by the complication. WhatI do observe to examine the situation of to—day isTransits. These I have found very reliable; but evenwith these I usually ignore aspects of minorimportance. Truth to tell, conjunctions mean verymuch more than the rest put together.Talking of aspects, I think it ridiculous to allow vast\"orbs\" like 15° for Luna, and 12° for Sol. Astrologersgo to extreme lengths to calculate the \"solarrevolution\" figure not to a degree, not to a minute,but to a second: and that when they don't know theexact time of birth within half an hour or more!...How can they? Rare is the person who takes time outto jot down the exact moment when a fetus, issuingfrom a vulva, draws its first breath and complainsagainst the Universe! Times registered in birthcertificates are approximate, to put it mildly; andthe mother who clocks the issue with a chronometeris so rare as to make astrological study of her childsuperannuated; for such a mother surely means tosupervise the unhappy wretch's conditioning for therest of its life — unless, of course, she is a truehuman being. But these are so rare...!... Talk about straining at a gnat and swallowing acamel! Then what does an hour or so matteranyhow, if you are going to allow an aspect, whetherit is 2° or 10° off? This even with delicate aspects"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"like the quintile or semi-sextile. What would youthink of a doctor who had a special thermometermade to register -1/100 of a degree, and never tooknotice of the fact that the patient had just swalloweda cupful of scalding hot tea?In my own work, I disallow a deviation of 5° or 6° fromthe exact aspect, unless there is some alien reasonfor thinking that it is actually operative. With theminor aspects, I dislike reckoning with them if theyare even 3° away.Nor do I see any sense in marking the odd minutes inthe Ascendant, when one is not sure even of thedecan.That seems to be about all that is necessary for my\"morning hate;\"...He was crotchety in the mornings those days, andwhen they complained, he — or they — gave rise tothis expression.

The only wonder is that heneither cut his own throat nor rose every morningto curse you, and me, and the rest of humankind.Heroin — he was a registered addict - England has afew saving graces, and this is one of them (but theyonly did it to keep The Beast alive, so it was not somuch to their credit) — became the only thing thatcould make him register, in his diary, before goingto his hard, cold bed at night, \"I have lived throughthe day.\" No wonder Fernando Pessoa, in Portugal,drank himself to death! Not everyone can have themoral force of an Aleister Crowley....; suppose we go on to the question of interpretation.Thousands of books have been written on Astrology;nobody could possible read them all thoroughly, andhe would be a great fool to try. But he may do littleharm by going into them far enough to observe thathardly any half-dozen are agreed even on the"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"foundations of their system, hardly any two upon themeaning of any given aspect, dignity, or position;there is not always agreement even upon whatquestions pertain to which houses.There are a few completely quack systems, such asthose which mix up the science with Toshosophicalhypotheses ...Like Alice Bailey's books, or Peter Ouspensky's, forinstance....; naturally you discard these. But even of generallyacceptable forms of Astrology, such as Mundane andHorary, I tend to be distrustful. I ask, for instance,why, if Taurus rules Poland and Ireland, as is nodoubt the case, the crash and massacres of 1939 e.v.and later in the one did not take place in the other. All the seaports of the world naturally come underone of the three watery signs; but we do not find thatan affliction of Pisces, which hits Tunis, should doharm to all the other harbours similarly ruled.This brings us to the first Big Jump in the steeplechaseof the whole science. We hear of thousands of peoplebeing killed at the same time (within an hour or two,perhaps a minute or two) by earthquake, shipwreck,explosion, battle or other form of violence. Was thehoroscope of every one of the victims marked withthe probability of some such end? I have known verystrange cases of coincidence, but not to that extent!The answer, I believe, is manifold. It might be, forexample, that Poland and Ireland are ruled bydifferent degrees of Taurus; that there are major andminor figures, the former overruling the latter, sothat the figure of the launching of the \"Titanic\"swallowed up the nativities of the victims of herwreck.Something of this sort is really an obvious truth. Floodin China, famine in India, pestilence anywhere,evidently depend on maps of a scale far moreenormous than the personal.Then—on this point I feel reasonably sure—there maybe one or more factors of which we know nothing atall, by which the basic possibilities of a figure are setto work.

I see no objection at all to postulating thatcertain \"rays,\" or other means of transmittingsome peculiar form or forms of energy, mayreach us from the other parts of the solarsystem; for we can in fact point to perfectlyanalogous phenomena in the discoveries of thelast hundred years or so.

Anelectric stove in the East or the South, is best: itmust not need attention. One can usually buy stoveswith excellent appropriate symbolism.

It can then be used to hold reserves ofincense and other requisites.Note that the height of the Altar has to suit yourconvenience. It is consequently in direct relationwith your own stature; in proportion, it is a doublecube. This then determines the size of your circle; infact the entire apparatus and furniture is ageometrical function of yourself. Consider it all as aprojection of yourself in terms of these conventionalformulae. (A convention does really mean \"thatwhich is convenient.\" How abject, then to obey aself-styled convention which is actually asinconvenient as possible!)Next, the Lamp. This may be of silver, or silver-gilt,(to represent the Path of ג) and is to be hung fromthe ceiling exactly above the centre of the altar.There are plenty of old church lamps which servevery well. The light is to be from a wick in a floatingcork in a glass of olive oil. (I hope you can get it!)

We need at least onehundred buyers to swing the deal, for the Chinesecompany naturally refuses to take the trouble ofselling less than several tons of Galangal root atany one time.

In fact, such idols are often already consecratedtalismans; and their possession and daily use is atleast two-thirds of the battle.The above speculation is incorrect, and Crowley ismerely indulging in exhibiting some of hisknowledge of the Magical Link in worship. There isabsolutely no guarantee that you will make contactwith the Teacher through a 'relic' of him or her; onthe contrary, the most likely result is that you willattract either an astral cadaver, or an elemental, ora demon, masquerading as that person.

All the cards wereagainst him.Why? Let me remind you of the sublimity of the man'sgenius, and the extent of his attainment. Apolloniusmust certainly have made the closest links betweenhis Ruach and his Supernal Triad, and this wouldhave gone seeking a new incarnation elsewhere. Allthe available Ruach left floating around in theAkasha must have been comparatively worthlessodds and ends, true Qlippoth or \"Shells of theDead\"—just those parts of him, in a word, whichApollonius would have deliberately discarded at hisdeath.So what use would they be to Lévi? ...Or to Grady McMurtry, for that matter. This is thetrue objection against worship of 'relics' of 'saints.' Ifthey were true saints, the relics would become thefocus of unhealthy forces; if they were false saints,the astral shells themselves would come, andvampirize the worshippers....

Let us first congratulate ourselves that thissubject of Necromancy is so admirably documented. As to the real Art, we have not only Eliphas Lévi, butthe sublimely simple account in the Old Testamentof the Witch of Endor, her conjuring up of theapparition of Samuel to King Saul. A third classicmust not be neglected: I have heard or read the storyelsewhere—for the moment I cannot place it. But itis so brilliantly told in I Write as I Please byWalter Duranty that nothing could be happier thanto quote him verbatim.It was the story of a Bolshevik whoconversed with a corpse. He told it tome himself, and undoubtedlybelieved it, although he was anaverage tough Bolshevik whonaturally disbelieved in Heaven andHell and a Life beyond the Grave. This man was doing 'underground'revolutionary work in St. Petersburgwhen the War broke out; but he wascaught by the police and exiled to thefar north of Siberia. In the secondwinter of the War he escaped fromhis prison camp and reached anEskimo village where they gave himshelter until the spring. They lived,he said, in beastly conditions, andthe only one whom he could talk towas the Shaman, or medicine man,who knew a little Russian. TheShaman once boasted that he couldforetell the future, which myBolshevik friend ridiculed. The nextday the Shaman took him to a cave inthe side of a hill in which there was abig transparent block of ice enclosingthe naked body of a man—a whiteman, not a native—apparently aboutthirty years of age with no sign of a"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"wound anywhere. The man's head,which was clean-shaven, was outsidethe block of ice; the eyes were closedand the features were European. Theshaman then lit a fire and burntsome leaves, threw powder on themmuttering incantations, and therewas a heavy aromatic smoke. He saidin Russian to the bolshevik, 'Askwhat you want to know.' TheBolshevik spoke in German; he wassure that the Shaman knew noGerman, but he was equally sure hesaw the lips move and heard itanswer, clearly, in German.He asked what would happen toRussia, and what would happen tohim. From the moving lips of thecorpse came the reply that Russiawould be defeated in war and thatthere would be a revolution; the Tzarwould be captured by his enemiesand killed on the eve of rescue; he,the Bolshevik, would fight in theRevolution but would suffer noharm; later, he would be woundedfighting a foreign enemy, but wouldrecover and live long.The Bolshevik did not really believewhat he had seen although he wascertain that he had seen it. I meanthat he explained it by hypnotism orauto-suggestion or something of thekind; but it was true, he said, that hepassed unscathed through theRevolution and the Civil War andwas wounded in the Polish Warwhen the Red Army recovered Kiev.So also we are most fortunate in possessing theaccount almost beyond Heart's desire of Spiritism, inRobert Browning's Mr. Sludge the Medium.

The same horribleprudishness is evident even today in suchsupposedly \"enlightened sexologists\" as Mastersand Johnson, who not only were very careful toavoid giving statistics of penis size, or women'sreaction to penis size, in their books, but went so faras to state the outrageous lie that once a penisgrows in erection, all men are more or less equal!Recently, in a Playboy magazine interview, theyadmitted that their intention had been to avoidcausing pain or inferiority complexes or whatever —not in these exact words. So you have a pair ofsupposed \"scientists\" who conceal facts from thepublic, just like the C.I.A., the K.G.B., the Vatican,Lysenko, and the average politician. Poor Skeat atleast was trying to save his job, but one doubts thatMasters and Johnson were in jeopardy fromanything but their own paternalism—maternalismand Judeo—Christist hypocrisy.

Perspiration—of a very special kind ...It is thick and slick, almost the consistency of semen,sometimes with the odor of semen, sometimes witha peculiar perfume, which may possibly be the thatof equivalent female hormones. Rubbed back intothe skin it invigorates the body.2. Sukshma-Khumbakam: automatic rigidity. Onestiffens like a dog in a bell-jar when you pump inCarbon Dioxide (is it?) 3. The Bhuchari-Siddhi, \"jumping about like a frog.\" One is wafted, without one's Asana being disturbed,about the floor, rather as fragments of paper, or dryleaves, might be in a slight draught under the door. 4. If one is quite perfectly balanced one cannot bemoved sideways; so one rises. And there you are!One should perhaps make a remark about HathaYoga. The term has often been translated as theUnion of Sun and Moon, and it can be so described,but it has also been translated as Union by Courage,and most definitely it can be so described. In orderto reach those stages that Crowley is describing theYogi has to endure formidable bodily pain, greatmental and emotional stress, and quite often thesensation that one is going to die if one sticks to thepractice a moment longer. This is not an image oran exaggeration: one has to experience it to believeit, but it is a fact. It is possible, indeed, although thiswriter does not think so, that the experience oflevitation is merely a delusion caused by a briefattack of insanity. But there have been eye—witnessaccounts of this experience from many parts of theworld, always related to religious ecstasy, althoughnot of any particular dogma — which may or maynot be significant. In his book, Flim Flam, whichshould make part of the library of any seriousstudent of occultism, Mr. James Randi expresses histotal disbelief in levitation, and he particularlydemolishes the levitation claims of the followers of"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"a \"Maharishi\" whose name I have never bothered tolearn, but who is connected directly or indirectly tothe Toshosophists, and who founded so-called\"Transcendental Meditation.\" It is difficult to saywhether the followers of this cunning millionaireare simply hypnotized or lying when they claim tolevitate It may even be possible that some of themdo levitate, briefly; but not at will. The phenomenonis very likely not subject to volition except in veryhigh Initiates, who usually do not have the time orenergy to develop it to such a point — we have otherpriorities. Obviously, it would edify Mr. Randi tosee the phenomenon happen under laboratoryconditions, but one of the problems involved is thatthe Yogi would have to be extremely advanced inconcentration in order to be able to achieve the kindof condition in which conscious levitation may occurin the presence of witnesses and recordingmachinery, and it is unlikely that any legitimateYogi would bother to do this. However, scientistscould try to duplicate Yogic phenomena forthemselves, and one can think of less satisfactoryplaces to practice Yoga than the seclusion of one'sown laboratory. I can personally vouch for thespecial kind of perspiration and for automaticrigidity, for I achieved these myself. But when thetremors of the third stage were starting with me Ireached Dhyana and certain insights, andabandoned Yoga completely, considering that I hadachieved the result that I had been striving for. Ascientists could at least try to verify those claimsbefore denying them; after all, is not that theMethod of Science? Mr. Randi, for instance, couldtry. But one must, as I said before, have the couragenecessary to face the very terrifying sensations ofapproaching insanity and/or approaching death.True yogis are probably even rarer than truepatriots, true statesmen, of true Christians.Personally, I reached the Bhuchari-Siddhi quite anumber of times; but I never observed No. 4.

It seems as ifone were somehow raised, possibly an inch from theground, and deposited very gently a short distanceaway.I saw a very striking case of this at Kandy. When Allanwas meditating, it was my duty to bring his food veryquietly (from time to time) into the room adjoiningthat where he was working. One day he missed twosuccessive meals, and I thought I ought to look intohis room to see if all was well. I must explain that Ihave known only two European women and threeEuropean men who could sit in the attitude calledPadmasana, which is that usually seen in seatedimages of the Buddha. Of these men, Allan was one. He could knot his legs so well that, putting his handson the ground, he could swing his body to and fro inthe air between them.

I set himright way up, and he came out of his trance. He wasquite unconscious that anything unusual hadhappened.

But I can form no theory as to how the practice couldcounteract the force of gravitation, and I amunregenerate enough to allow this to make mesceptical about the occurrence of levitation. Yet,after all, the stars are suspended in space. There isno à priori reason why the forces which preventthem rushing together should not come intooperation in respect of the earth and the body.The Allan part of this is the best evidence at mydisposal. He couldn't have got where he did byhopping, and he couldn't have got into that positionintentionally; he must have been levitated, lostbalance, and dropped upside down.

But I did not persist when I found outhow to do it by fascination. (Here we are at last!)Roughly, this is how to do it. If one is concentrated tothe point when what you are thinking of is the onlyreality in the Universe, when you lose all awarenessof who and where you are and what you are doing, itseems as though that unconsciousness were in someway contagious. The people around you just can't seeanybody.At one time, in Sicily, this happened nearly every day.

Higher. Here we fall straight into the arms of Freud.Why \"higher?\" Because in a scrap it is easier tostrangle him if you are on top. When very youngchildren watch their parents in actu coitus, acircumstance exceedingly usual almost anywhereoutside England, and even here where houseroom isrestricted, the infant supposes that his mother, uponwhom he depends entirely for nourishment, is beingattacked by the intrusive stranger whom they wanthim to address as \"Dad.\" ...Not if the child's intelligence exceeds that of theaverage clod; an observant boy or girl will perceivethat the act is violent but not angry, and will oftenget the first localized flowering of the sexual instinctfrom such a sight. The conflict comes only in lessintelligent minds, particularly in societiesconditioned by sexual restriction. Naturally, for theaverage Jew, and for Freud himself, hisinterpretation was apt. It was also apt for theaverage Christist. But it would not have been apt forSouth Sea islanders before, as Mark Twain put it,the Christist missionaries taught them the meaningof hell; and it was not apt to this writer's reaction,which we detailed in our introduction to The BaghI Muattar in Equinox V 4. Wilhelm Reich'sanalysis of the sexual instinct in children is muchwiser than Freud's; but then, as we ourselvespointed elsewhere, Freud, although a genius,labored under a big handicap, poor fellow: he hadnever been psychoanalysed or undergone Thelemictraining!... From this seed springs an \"over-under complex,\"giving rise later on, in certain cases to whole legionsof neuroses."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"The problem is, however, a little ampler than that.Most societies presuppose that what is \"higher\" is\"better.\" This is not related merely to Freudian—Jewish—Christist sexual hangups; it is related to thesimple fact of brute force. If it is taller than you, it isusually bigger than you, and if it is bigger than you,it is higher than you for the simple reason that itcan beat the living crap out of you. This comes fromthe primeval slime itself. If women were biggerphysically than men, it is very likely that the malewould be fighting for an E.R.A. right now, ratherthan the other way around. Sociobiology deservesserious study from statesmen and from jurists, butis unlikely to get it as long as Christist prejudicelingers in the average human mind.Now then make it a little clearer, please, just what youmean by \"higher.\"Skeat seems to connect it with hills, swellings, boils,the maternal breast; is that reason enough for us toconnect it with the idea of advantage, or—\"superiority\" merely translates it into Latin!—worth, or—no, it's really too difficult. Of course,sometimes it has a \"bad\" meaning, as of temperaturein fever; but nearly always it implies a conditionpreferable to \"low.\"Why, yes, of course; from the point of view of thehealthy animal, it is better to beat than to getbeaten! So what 'higher' simply means is that,unless you are the one looking down, you are cowedand defeated and subservient. This is related tomasochism and to the human mind's capacity forself—deception in order to preserve an illusion ofself—respect. He is bigger than I, and can beat meup; therefore, let me try to find some arguments bywhich I may convince myself that it is right andproper that he be the ruler, and I the rulee. Theinvention of weapons went a long way towardschanging the material odds in this game, but themoral odds have not changed. It may no longer bethe bigger man or woman who rules, but it is stillthe man or woman with the most efficient sexualweapon. If this, incidentally, can be applied to thesexual organs, it is difficult to say. The mystique ofmale member size seems to be that the bigger it is,"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"the better; but the male's mystique of the femaleorgan seems to be that the tighter it is, therefore thesmaller, the better. As we observed before, Mastersand Johnson have done their best to confuse sexualcompetitiveness, when they, with their type ofresearch, were above all other scientists in aposition to clear it for keeps. Given their reticence,and given the \"egalitarian\" and socialistictendencies of the modern so—called \"liberal\" mind,it is quite possible that the mystique of penis size isactually based on statistics, at least to an extent.Future scientists will probably have to work on this.If you think it is not important, you do notunderstand very well how what is between yourlegs influences that which is between yourshoulders. The point of this note, however, is simplythat the concept of \"higher\" does not have any\"uplifting\" qualities to it (I really find it hard toresist a pun.) It merely indicates the slave'srecognition of his or her state of subjugation to hisor her tyrant.Applied to the \"self,\" it becomes a sort of trade name;nobody tells me if he means Khu, or Ba, or Khabs, orUt of the Upanishads or Augoeides of the Neo-Platonists, or Adonai of Bulwer-Lytton, or — — herewe are with all those thrice-accurs't alternatives.

First you want to go up; then you wantto go in. Why?Because it is 'safe,' of course. It is related to thetroglodyte, or any other animal, retreating into itslair. So you see that the combination of 'higher' and'within' merely underlines two of the human being'smost ancient negative attitudes: subservience andretreat.As \"higher\" gave the idea of aggression, of conquest,\"within\" usually implies safety.

The islandershad their own language and their own alphabet —the Runic alphabet — and the two were phoneticallyrelated, which means that words were written in thesame way they are pronounced. But the Runicalphabet was also related to the local religion,which was Druidism; and this would never do. Sothe missionaries declared the Runic alphabet \"evil\"and \"satanic,\" burned the Druids alive, and hadhanged or tortured to death anyone who should befound writing in runes.

Crowleyin his old age was genuinely surprised at the levelsof insight he had been able to put across in a fewwords in such a short book — less than a hundredpages without the commentaries and notes,remember. When an initiate is just out of a Trance,or fresh from a Magickal Retirement, he or she mayproduce work that later on, re-reading it, willsurprise him or her. The Inner Being is the same, butthe personality is functioning at a much lower rateof vibration and may even exclaim to itself insurprise: 'Did I write this?!'

When I reached my second initiation I askedmy Angel to take away all the \"rewards\" — meaning\"siddha,\" etc. — of my grade except those absolutelynecessary to serve those under my care in the Order.The purpose of this request was to make possiblethat, by going further more nakedly into every by—way of my being, I would ensure that my nextmeeting with the Angel would be much intenser inall directions than it would be if I were allowed toenjoy the comfort of \"powers.\" The request wasgranted, and as a result I often find myself readingmy letters to pupils, or the annotations I write toCrowley's books, in order to cull some insights formyself.

A religion then, is a moreor less coherent and consistent set ofbeliefs, with precepts and prohibitionstherefrom deducible. But then there isthe sense in which Frazer (and I) oftenuse the word: as in opposition to\"Science\" or \"Magic.\" Here the point isthat religious people attributephenomena to the will of some postulatedBeing or Beings, placable and moveableby virtue of sacrifice, devotion, or appeal. Against such, the scientific or magicalmind believes in the Laws of Nature,asserts \"If A, then B\"—if you do so—and—so, the result will be so—and—so, alooffrom arbitrary interference.

(You rememberhow this happened, and what came of it,in a rather clever short story by H.G.Wells.) For true Magick means \"toemploy one set of natural forces at amechanical advantage as against anotherset\"—I quote, as closely as memoryserves, Thomas Henry Huxley, when heexplains that when he lifts his water—jug—or his elbow—he does not \"defy the Lawof Gravitation.\" On the contrary, he usesthat Law; its equations form part of thesystem by which he lifts the jug withoutspilling the water.To sum up, our system is a religion just sofar as a religion means an enthusiasticputting—together of a series of doctrines,no one of which must in any way clashwith Science or Magick.Call it a new religion, then, if it so pleaseyour Gracious Majesty; but I confess thatI fail to see what you will have gained byso doing, and I feel bound to add that youmight easily cause a great deal ofmisunderstanding, and work a ratherstupid kind of mischief.The word does not occur in The Book ofthe Law.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally,666Θελημα is not a religion: it is a mode ofTheurgy.

The new Master is \"cast out\" intothe sphere appropriate to the nature ofhis own particular Great Work. And it isproper for him to act in true accordancewith the nature of the man as he waswhen he passed through that Sphere (orGrade) on his upward journey.

What actually happened wasthat he invoked the \"Devil,\" since he wasabsolutely revolted with the results of so—called Christianity; and wasflabbergasted when he was visited by the\"Christ\" as effect of his \"satanic\"invocations. This being was, of course,Aiwass Himself, though it was yearsbefore Crowley understood this. Cf.

The psychology of theMongolian was vastly different from theChinese prior to Lao Zi's emigration (weare not trying to suggest a chain of causeand effect) to the Mongol steppes. TheMongols practiced shamanism of thesimplest sort, and could safely be calledfetishists. The Chinese had an extremelysophisticated corpus of mysticism, whichunfortunately continue to bemisunderstood by most western scholars.The equation of \"heaven\" with the Judeo-Christian vulgar concept of the after-life,for instance, is ridiculous. What theChinese meant by \"Heaven\" was roughlythe same as the Thelemic qabalist meanswhen he or she speaks of the Supernals,at least in terms of level of discourse. Nosingle deity or location is meant or couldbe meant by the term that we translateas \"heaven.\" The simple shamanism ofthe Mongols is best exemplified byGenghis Khan, who tolerated allreligions, and enforced the toleration ofall religions, as long as he lived, andreceived not only Jewish scholars butChristian priests in his tent. He allowedand even encouraged his children and hischieftains to hear their discourses yet,kept faithful to the religion of hisforefathers to the day of his death, andabove all venerated the totem of histribe, which happened to be the hawk.The infusion of Chinese sophistication inMongolian psychology came only whenKublai Khan, Genghis' grandson,abandoned the life of the steppes andbecame even more Chinese than theChinese themselves.

This is the sort of thing that in theabsence of an adequate number ofexperimenters to provide parameters ofmeasurement must remain at least forthe time being, subject to purely personalevaluation.

This situation has been changed to a degreesince, mostly by Frater Saturnus X°having taken residence, during the lastyears of his life, in that country. WhatCrowley did not understand during hisstay in America was that he was underconstant magickal attack; this attackmanifested particularly through pseudo—American Masons. In this respect, it isilluminating to read Simburne Clymer'sworks on Rosicrucianism, andparticularly attacks against A.M.O.R.C.Mr. Clymer's works were written withthe purpose of proving that A.M.O.R.C.was not the 'real' Rosicrucian society inAmerica.

Mr. Clymer's(or whoever wrote under this name)works are, therefore, self—defeatinginsofar as the intention was to prove ordisprove the legitimacy of anyRosicrucian movement.

His verysimplest ideas, the primitive elements ofhis thought, had no true correspondencesin any European terminology. The veryfirst word \"Tao\" presented a completelyinsoluble problem. It had been translated\"Reason\", \"The Way\", \"Το Ον.\" None ofthese convey any true conception of theTao.The Tao is reason in this sense, that thesubstance of things may be in partapprehended as being that necessaryrelation between the elements of thoughtwhich determines the laws of reason. Inother words, the only reality is that whichcompels us to connect the various formsof illusion as we do. Or, in still other words, since all that whichwe can think of is not true, but merely animage of reality falsified through the lensof the Ego, the gestalt of the process bywhich we reason is the only reality, sinceit equates with our psychosomatictendencies. The Ego is thus, a polity oragain, a gestalt, rather than a Monad. Aresultant cannot be called the only forcesince it is a function and not a constant.Indeed, the only constants are theconditions under which the gestalts occur—and these are syndromes, not Monads.It is thus evidently unknowable, andexpressible neither by speech nor bysilence.

Nothing exists except as a relationwith other similarly postulated ideas. Nothing can be known in itself, but onlyas one of the participants in a series ofevents. Reality is therefore in themotion, not in the thing moved.In this sense, 'Way' becomes a peculiarlyapt description, since the word meanssimultaneously manner (or process) andpath. The reader should note that again,it is a gestalt that is sought through theconcept. (We use the word 'gestalt,'rather loosely, and not at all in itsaccepted psychoanalytical sense, toindicate a coherent summation in themind of stimuli occurring in severallevels. These levels in themselves, beingup to a point part of the stimuli; and yet,simultaneously, parameters of theconditions through which the stimuli can"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"occur.)We cannot apprehend anything except asone postulated element of an observedimpression of change. We may expressthis in other terms as follows. Ourknowledge of anything is in reality thesum of our observations of its successivemovements, that is to say, of its pathfrom event to event. In this sense the Taomay be translated as \"the Way.\" It is nota thing in itself in the sense of being anobject susceptible of apprehension bysense or mind. As a way or process, however, it can beapprehended—or we would not be talkingabout it here! Its enormous complexity ofoperation, however, makes any attemptsat analysis confusing and even misleading.It is not susceptible to intellectualapprehension in the normal sense;indeed, any one intellectual formulationof it can but be partial, as A.C. isdemonstrating as he goes, and as Lao Zihimself stated very simply and firmly inthe first paragraph of his book.It is not the cause of anything; it is ratherthe category underlying all existence orevent ...This breath—taking concept is of a daringunequalled by theologians at any time,and makes Lao Zi, perhaps, the deepestthinker of all ages. It must be clearlyapprehended, especially by minds ofscientific bent. Lao Zi states as we did,that our apprehension of reality islimited by our psychosoma, but he goesstill further and says that the way inwhich our psychosoma is formed, and themanner in which our psychosomafunctions, are precipitations orprojections of the cosmic balance offorces, or the \"All-Dao.\" He thereforetakes us into an assessment—or attemptat assessment—of the origin ofintelligent life.

Being the 'Universal Balance of Forces,' theAll-Dao in itself, is totally indifferent tothe occurrence of events.Yet our experience when analyzed tells usthat the only reality of which we may besure is this path or Way which resumesthe whole of our knowledge.This point of view is clearly arguable; butit is arguable in the last quarter of theTwentieth Century, after cybernetics,computer analysis, integrated circuitry,the neutron, the positron, the neutrino, etal.; to say nothing of the fact that wewho say it is arguable, have reached theposition of stating so by following thevery psychological and ethical theoriesestablished by Crowley. The All-Dao hasno 'power' to cause anything to exist orto take place; yet, things do exist and dotake place (this last expression by theway, deserved careful attention fromphysicists, advanced mathematicians andpsychologists with a modicum ofscientific training-unhappily, few as yet).Why? This question is related to theMystery of the Magus and perhaps, theIpsissimus; it is presumptuous for us togo into it except to state, again, thatPoint-Events do occur and perhaps, toadd that as the Atheists say, There is nogod but man; at least, as long as wekeep slaying the cetaceans for meat andblubber.As for TO ON ...TO is the Greek article of the, ON is thepresent participle of the verb to be;hence, The Being, or that which is"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"'absolute existence.' It may surprise mostmodern speakers of the English languageto learn that 'being' is not an originalAnglo-Saxon word, but an attempt totranslate Platonic concepts of existenceinto English; and this indirectly, since theinfluence was that of Thomas Aquinas! Itmay also surprise not only modernspeakers of English, but many pseudo-philosophers and scholars, that TO ON isin essence, the same thing as the HinduATMAN. This concept is totally un-Thelemic. Cf.Liber VII IV,51. In a veryrestricted sense, what A.C. means by hisobjections to the use of TO ON as atranslation of the Dao is that thePlatonic concept of existence is connectedwith the Platonic ideal 'Archetypes.'From the Thelemic point of view, thosearchetypes, which were so useful toChristist theologians, beginning withAquinas are merely expressions ofcultural prejudice at its worst.... which superficially might seem the besttranslation of Tao as described in thetext, it is the most misleading of thethree. For To On possesses an extensiveconnotation implying a whole system ofPlatonic concepts, than which nothing canbe more alien to the essential quality ofthe Tao. Tao is neither \"being\" nor \"notbeing\" in any sense which Europe couldunderstand. It is neither existence, nor acondition or form of existence. Equally,TO MH ON gives no idea of Tao. Tao isaltogether alien to all that class ofthought.

But, evendeeper than this, part of the reality of theinscrutable energy which determines theform of our experience, consists indetermining that experience should takeplace at all. It should be clear that thishas nothing to do with any of the Platonicconceptions of the nature of things.In short, it is not conceptions (no matterhow glorious or all-including!) that arebeing investigated, but the conceivingfaculty itself.

SurelyDamon Knights classic story, \"To ServeMan,\" cannot be entirely forgotten! Noone has established yet that thecetaceans are out to cook and eat us-rather the contrary.The least abject asset in the intellectualbankruptcy of European thought is theHebrew Qabalah. Now that is a fine phrase, and perhapsJewish scholars will understand betterwhy we prefer the expression ThelemicQabalah. For the Jewish Qabalists intheir majority are as foolish and asdogmatic as the Christist theologians.We remember meeting a Jew, a high—grade old—aeon Mason, who as veryshocked when we insinuated thatperhaps the Qabalah had been made formen and not men for the Qabalah!

Du Guesclin's famous wife) at a timeof the most narrow—minded andbloodthirsty religious persecutions in thehistory of the Western world. TheQabalists had to walk a razor's edge,with the burning stake on one side of thethreat of madness at the other. Perhapsat some future date the history date, thehistory of this period of formation of themodern Qabalah—the experimentalQabalah of mystics and magickians—willbe determined; perhaps the records arehopelessly lost by now. At any rate, theQabalah that we prefer to call Thelemicstarted making an appearance during theMiddle Ages, probably at the same timethat Masonry began to form (see ourLetter to a Brazilian Mason).Undoubtedly it was known by theAlchemists, consequently also by theRosicrucians (so—called). During thereign of Frederick the Second, perhaps,Arab and Jewish scholarship was able toconfer and coalesce the Qabalah thateventually pervaded the mysticalfraternities of the following centuries.The word 'occultism,' still so much in use,should be mentioned in this context.Obscurantism was never the intention ofthe early and legitimate Masons,Rosicrucians and Alchemists. They kepttheir findings and their experimentssecret in order to spare themselves andtheir descendants (as well, and perhapsforemost, as their successors) the mosthideous death at the hands of dementedbigots. It was never the intention ofthose honest and brave men, whosememory honors our race, to cast a veil ofsecrecy around their findings in order tokeep themselves the superiors (?!) oftheir fellowmen. Indeed, this concept is a"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"slave—concept. They fully intended tomake their findings public as soon asthey could do so without foolishlysacrificing themselves—onlymegalomaniacs yearn after martyrdom,and only the Christists amongmegalomaniacs, at that. And they didmake their findings public, skillfully andpatiently. Many died in the process,having been too optimistic about thelevel of intellectual awareness andemotional control of the people to whomthey made their revelations. GiordanoBruno and Michel Servet are but twoexamples.... Properly understood, it is a system ofsymbolism indefinitely elastic, assumingno axioms, postulating no principles,asserting no theorems, and thereforeadaptable, if managed adroitly, todescribe any conceivable doctrine.In the same way in which Gregory IXplaced in the 'Holy Sepulchre' underinterdict after Frederick the Secondexcommunicated, became the firstChristian (we do not mean Christist!) toachieve a successful Crusade to make itsafe for visitation by Christists, weexpect orthodox Jewish Qabalists toabjure and deplore this view of theQabalah. It is a measure of Crowley'sgenuine love and respect for hisfellowmen that he never conceived such apossibility. In spite of his childhood andthe attacks he suffered throughout hislife, he never really understood theextent of stupidity and blind hatredamong human beings until in his lateforties. And he spent the next thirty yearsof his life wishing he were dead—butforced to go on living in order to remain—the Beast.It has been my continual study since 1898,and I have found it of infinite value in the"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"study of the \"Tao Teh King.\" By its aid Iwas able to attribute the ideas of Lao Tzeto an order with which I was exceedinglyfamiliar, and whose practical worth I hadrepeatedly proved by using it as the basisof the analysis and classification of allAryan and Semitic religions andphilosophies. Despite the essentialdifficulty of correlating the ideas of LaoTze with any others, the persistentapplication of the Qabalistic keyseventually unlocked his treasure-house. Iwas able to explain to myself histeachings in terms of familiar systems.This achievement broke the back of mySphinx. Having once reduced Lao Tze toQabalistic form, it was easy to translatethe result into the language ofphilosophy. I had already done much tocreate a new language based on Englishwith the assistance of a few technicalterms borrowed from Asia, and above allby the use of a novel conception of theidea of Number and of algebraic andarithmetical procedure to convey theresults of spiritual experience tointelligent students.Indeed, this was perhaps the foremostachievement of Crowley as a scholar.Something of the sort had beenattempted by William James before himin Varieties of ReligiousExperience. But although there is nodenying the depth of James'psychological insight, he was not himself,a mystic. And A.C.'s achievement farsurpasses his in every sense.It is therefore not altogether withoutconfidence that I present this translationof the Tao Teh King to the public.

It musthowever be laid to heart that the essenceof his system will inevitably eludeintellectual apprehension, unless it beilluminated from above by actual livingexperience of the truth. Such experienceis only to be attained by unswervingapplication to the prac- tices which headvocates. Nor must the aspirant contenthimself with the mere attainment ofspiritual enlightenment, howeversublime. All such achievements arebarren unless they be regarded as themeans rather than the end of spiritualprogress; allowed to infiltrate everydetail of the life, not only of the spirit, butof the senses.Cf. LXV iv 18-21; 26; 42-46. Also LXV v 8-10; 20-26.The Tao can never be known until itinterprets the most trivial actions ofevery day routine. It is a fatal mistake todiscriminate between the spiritualimportance of meditation and playinggolf. To do so is to create an internalconflict. Let there be no difference madeamong you between any one thing &any other thing; for thereby therecometh hurt.He who knows the Tao knows it to be thesource of all things soever; the mostexalted spiritual ecstasy and the mosttrivial internal impression are from ourpoint of view ...Now, this 'we' in which Crowley soblissfully includes his readers, actuallyrefers to the deepest and most brilliantminds on the surface of the planet.

It is becausethe purpose of Liber Legis was tointegrate all existing psychologicalresearch (this includes religiousexperience, although it does NOT includereligious dogma) into on equation;specifically, 2=0. Liber Legis is not ametaphysical treatise (as in a sense, theDao De Jing), but a Code of Ethics. Inshort, it is a set of Commandments—wehope better and more inclusive than anygiven before; but certainly, not the last.It is indeed, the only religious code inhistory that predicts its own demise. Cf.AL iii 34. If we are permitted to addsome autobiographical data here, it wasthe very fact that Liber Legis not onlyadmitted its limitations, but predictedthe conditions under which it wouldbecome invalid that was foremost in ourdecision to accept it as our personalguide and rule of life, on all planes untilthe time when the Lady of the Swordand the Scales shall rise.... and I was as constantly disappointedwhen they declared that it did notimpress them, especially as mypreliminary descriptions of the book hadaroused their keenest interest.We have had a similar experience onrecommending Liber CCCXXXIII, TheBook of Lies, to intelligent people asthe supreme masterpiece of initiated"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"wisdom-greater even, than the Dao DeJing!...I thus came to see that the fault lay withLegge's translation, ...Now, here the two-edge sword of Reason isbeing wielded.

How could poor Legge hope totranslate Lao Zi's thought correctly? Thefault is not with the translator, but withthe readers, as we have learnedthroughout the years, by recommendingLiber 333 to all and sundry. Legge did asgood a job as could be expected from anhonest, and highly intelligent scholar;unless he were also a mystic and an M.T.at least!... and I felt myself impelled to undertakethe task of presenting Lao Tze in languageinformed by the sympatheticunderstanding which initiation andspiritual experience had conferred onme. During my Great MagicalRetirement on Aesopus Island in theHudson River during the summer of 1918e.v., I set myself to this work, but Idiscovered immediately that I was totallyincompetent. I therefore appealed to anAdept named Amalantrah, which whom Iwas at that time in almost dailycommunication.This, although possible is unlikely. Crowleywas very fond at that time, of imitatingthe con artist practices of Blavatskyregarding the Hidden Mahatmas and soforth.

Crowley'sversion we can attest as an Initiate, isnot only faithful to the original as hasthe added advantage of being couched inThelemic expressions. In this sense, itprovides added insight into some of thehigher and subtler meanings of LiberLegis.He had translated the Chinese with singularfidelity, yet in almost every verse theinterpretation was altogethermisleading.

The onlyone who was always outspokenlyenthusiastic about Crowley's translationof the Dao De Jing was Mr. KarlJohannes Germer. But we do not doubtthat many outstanding scholars,scientists and writers became acquaintedwith it. Crowley was intimate, or onfriendly terms with men of the level ofJ.W.N. Sullivan, J.B.S. Haldane, A.N.Whitehead and Bertrand Russell.Certainly lesser minds than his in hisspecialty, but at least some of them,outstanding pioneers in their own fields.Those men never advertised theiracquaintance with the 'wickedest man inthe world.' Undoubtedly they feltembarrassed in some cases, or decided itwas better to lurk in others. Anyhow,through their acquaintance, Crowley hada much deeper influence in the thought ofhis time and subsequent time, than isgenerally realized. Jung for example,owes much to Crowley, although henever acknowledged it. We believe it canbe stated with complete truth that nooutstanding mystic, philosopher,psychologist, sociologist, metaphysicianor even statesman since Crowley hasfailed to owe some debt to that strange(to the jejune and the bourgeois) man'sthought and work.So there you are.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally,666"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"LETTER 36: QUO STETOLYMPUS: WHERETHE GODS, ANGELS,ETC.

To them the man is no more than thenecessary creator and sustainer of herchildren.This type is still the most common in theworld. It is often hostile to feminism;also in favor of aspects of feminism thatwill increase the subservience of themale to the female but not those aspectsthat will increase female autonomy fromthe patriarchal family system, unless itbe to institute a matriarchal familysystem. They are sometimes lesbians,since the male is only important to themas fertilizer, but must become mothersbefore they abandon themselves to theirbrand of lesbianism. Many have neverexperienced an orgasm in heterosexualintercourse, and do not care one way orthe other. Restrictive religions such asChristism, Orthodox Judaism, and someforms of Brahmanism and Buddhismappeal strongly to this type of womanand are supported by them. The extremetype of this woman is called 'chaste' inThe Book of the Law. The classicalJewish \"supermom,\" as well as theItalian Roman Catholic mom and theclassical American mom come from thistype of woman.The Osiris-Class comprises those womenwho are devoted to their man qua man,and to his career. Her children, if any,she values as reproductions of theBeloved; they carry him on into futurityby virtue of her deathless love.This type of woman is the self—sacrificingtype.

A man mustbe a companion or a partner, never amaster or an idol. They are selfish, andwhy should they not be? They include, ofcourse, \"playgirls;\" they also includewomen like Helena Blavatsky andElizabeth I. Such women are repulsed bythe purely animal aspects of maternity,and if they decide to have children theyusually reach this decision by an act ofWill, not under the impulse of instinct oremotion. They may be lesbians as well.When heterosexual, they make the bestpossible partners to males who canrespect their independence and treatthem as equals socially, intellectually,and spiritually. In the past Aeon, thosewomen were usually reduced torestricted occupations, or occupationsconsidered \"immoral.\" They becameactresses, dancers, prostitutes, \"witches\"or outlaws, for the system did not allowthem to be anything else. They are stillfeared by most men, and hated by manywomen. The Aeon is too young for themasses of humankind to understandthem, or for them to fully understandthemselves. Even Crowley himself didnot understand them very well, as onecan see from his description.

He is, of course,stating the point of view of the Aspirant.The converse, naturally, is also true: ifyou are a woman, and intend to becomean initiate (or anything else ofimportance in this world outside thenorm), you must consider all men — andall other women and all things, as amatter of fact — subordinate to yourTrue Will. Unless you understand thispoint, you will entirely miss Crowley'sthought. Women \"should be held in equalthough dissimilar honour:\" meaning thateach type of True Will deserves equalrespect, but must be reacted to accordingto one's own True Will. Each of us, maleor female, is, and must remain, the centerof our own universe.

From my standpoint, the Horus—Class are hard to deal with, but at leastgive spice to life. To each his or her ownWill, of course.But the really important issue is therecognition of each type of True Will inwoman.Especially by women, of each other and ofthemselves. The Osiris—Class is frownedupon by the Isis—Class, who are still themajority, and only tolerated becausethey, also, often have children.

The point of the articlewas the mathematical inevitability ofcoincidences — and the temptation totake a coincidence as a manifestation ofthe \"paranormal.\" (I do not know if theauthor read Crowley; I know Rhine did.)However, the subject is not so simple. Ona certain plane or planes, and perhaps onthe inmost plane, the Universe is aContinuum. Coincidence followingvolition may be simple coincidence, butseldom is.

The parallel on the physical plane is thedifference between Onanism and SexualIntercourse.The word \"onanism\" is here used in itsmore common meaning of\"masturbation,\" rather than its Biblicalmeaning of \"coitus interruptus.\"Probably, my reason for insistence on thispoint is my antipathy to introversion inany form. The \"mystic path\" itself ispacked with dangers. Unless thestrongest counter—irritants areexhibited, the process is almost certain tobecome morbid. It is only one step fromthe Invocation of Zeus, or Apollo, orDionysus, which does demandidentification of oneself with the object ofone's worship, to a form of self—worshipwhich soon develops into a maniacalexacerbation of the Ego; and if onepersists in this involuted curve, onebecomes a \"Black Brother,\" or departs forthe local loony-bin.Invocations of even the most positive Godsare dangerous, unless care can be taken tokeep the personality of the god distinctfrom one's own. Athene is a superb deity;but one does not want to be nothing butAthene, except in that supreme momentof Samadhi with Her which is the climaxof the invocation.The next two paragraphs were cut out byMr. Regardie:Do you remember one of Barbeyd'Aurevilly's Contes Cruels about aSpanish nobleman who anticipated one of"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"the privileges of marriage instead ofwaiting for ecclesiastical licence?

Itwould obviously not occur if sexualactivity were truly socially accepted,which it is not: if it were, adolescents onreaching puberty would be encouragedto fuck, rather than furtively encouragedto masturbate. The objections tomasturbation are multiple, bothmagickally and psychologically.Psychologically, as Crowley states, itcreates autism where it did not existbefore, or exacerbates it where it alreadyexisted. Magickally, its effects are evenmore dangerous.

Orgasm — either male or female —is creative.

This was done by nature —call it \"God\" if you will, but if you do, tryto remember that what is natural isgodlike — basically to ensure thereproduction, therefore the survival, ofthe species. If an individual acquires thehabit of pleasuring himself or herselfrather than pleasuring or beingpleasured by another individual this notonly goes counter to the naturalfunctions of sex but also counter to thesocial instincts of the person. Onebecomes incapable of truly empathizing,therefore of truly understanding theneeds of others. Societies in which sex isa \"sin\" always surround sexual activitywith all kinds of aberrant taboos.

It is precisely adolescents who mostneed to fuck: at that age, sexual activityis paramount, concern with sex isoverwhelming, the sensations andemotions are at their apex.

I can speak ofmasturbation with knowledge, for Imyself was given to this habit until myearliest twenties; I stoppedmasturbating finally on the advice ofboth Parsifal Krumm—Heller and KarlJohannes Germer, and under theguidance of the latter. In my case, I hadnever really enjoyed the habit; I yieldedto it under the pressure of hydraulics andunder the restrictions of a veryunhealthy home life, with parents whowere not only sexually restricted byeven, in a psychological sense, sexuallyperverted. And my parents were sexuallyrestricted and psychologically pervertedprecisely because they had been broughtup in the kind of society that considerssexual activity sinful, and equateschastity with sexual repression. In thiskind of society, the young hide and playwith themselves — an excellentexpression! — instead of playing witheach other. And then people wonder whythe sexes do not understand each other,or hate each other, or why the rich areunfeeling, or why governments areunscrupulous, or why priests, preachersand psychoanalysts are insane.

You should not, bythe way, confuse the habit ofmasturbation with the use ofmasturbation as a magickal ritual — athing, incidentally, which is not doneexcept in most exceptionalcircumstances. No: one speaks ofmasturbation here as a form of self—indulgence; and this form of self—indulgence is more dangerous than anyhabit—forming drug, religion included.As a matter of fact, it is closely related toreligious fanaticism, the refusal to facereality, and the incapacity to see oneself.The social encouragement of acceptanceof masturbation by pedagogues andpsychologists, which one notes in modernAmerican society, is one of the wrongestpossible things. The relaxation of socialrestriction led to frankness in sexualmatters, and masturbation was finallyfaced and discussed socially. The moralcowardice and social hypocrisy of athousand years of Judeo—Christism,however, have not been faced by so—called psychoanalysts of Mr. Regardie'silk. Perhaps they simply have beenunable to perceive the roots of their ownconditioning and complexes; more likely,they are more interested in makingmoney than in benefitting society; this,also, is a form of playing with oneself.Whatever their reasons, these have ledto social encouragement of precisely thehabit that would not exist at all — unlessas an atavism or under most unusualcircumstances — if sexual activity werereally accepted.

Forexample, the Archangel Ratziel is lord ofa company of angels called Auphanim;and one must not imagine that all theseangels are identical with one another, orthere would not seem to be much sense init. They have some sort of composition,some sort of individuality; and thecharacter and appearance of the Angel canbe determined by its name.I do not think that I have anywherementioned how this is done.

The reader should realize that allthis is merely a communication code inthis case based on Hebrew lore. Ascientific study of such entities can beconducted on totally different lines,according to the precepts or symbolismof another cultural tradition. This wholesubject matter was first covered byCrowley in Liber 777, which we areexpanding to include as many systems aspossible. But our choice will always be,to some extent, limited by the fact thatwe use the so called Hebrew Qabalah actually, the Medieval Qabalah of theAlchemists, \"Rosicrucians\" and Masons as a rosetta stone. Crowley chose itbecause he considered it the mostpractical and efficient system, and weconcur. But future researchers shouldkeep in mind that whenever youstructure knowledge you are limited bythe structure itself you are using. Oursuccessors may find a more efficientrosetta stone that the Magickal Qabalah.But if so, they will still have evolved amore efficient system from that ofMaimonides, \"Christian Rosenkreutz,\"and Aleister Crowley.Some further detail might be indicated bytaking the letters ד and מ together, forDam is the Hebrew word for blood.

But this is tojudge too rashly; for ♀ himself is only anemanation of the number 7, and istherefore indestructible. {Handwrittennote: Because she-he comes from ... whois △ + □, 3 + 4}As ♃ \"herself\" is equally indestructible,being an emanation of the number 4.

Most aristocratsunder Christism, for instance, havepracticed license, not freedom. In everyhuman society, there has always been acurrent of people who are sexually free.Under Christism, these people have hadto go into strict hiding in order topreserve their social status or,sometimes, their lives; but they are not\"aristocrats\" as a rule. In fact, suchpeople may appear on any level ofsociety; it is merely that under themurderous repression of Christism it hasbeen easier for them to survive andexpress themselves, albeit limitedly andfurtively, when they have had status ormoney. But sexual freedom is a spiritualoutlook, not a status symbol. InEuropean countries such sexually freepeople were so savagely repressedduring the Middle Ages by torture,imprisonment, and genocide that forseveral generations the strain becamerecessive.It is the system natural to any one who haspsycho—analysed away all his complexes,repressions, fixations and phobias.(4) As matriarchy reflected the Formula of"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"the Aeon of Isis, and patriarchy that ofOsiris, so does the rule of the \"Crownedand Conquering Child\" express that ofHorus.

The dichotomy has alwaysexisted; but under Christism, the lowertype was maniacally defended at theexpense of the higher. This insidiousdisease is still so prevalent that one findsa usually intelligent woman, whopretends to be a feminist but is obviouslya die—hard Christist, Ursula K. LeGuin,writing the following preposterousstatement in one of her novellas: That anindividual who saves someone else's livemust be eternally grateful to the personwhose life he or she has saved, especiallyif he or she did so at risk of his or herown existence! You will find this idiocy in\"The Name of the World is Forest.\" So, asyou can see, not only is the debtorabsolved from the need to showgratitude or to seek to compensate his orher savior for services rendered, but thesavior is supposed to think that he or sheis the true debtor! This entire concept isconnected with the psychology of theslave—gods and with the corruption ofthe \"Dying-God\" formula underChristism. Ms. LeGuin ought to beashamed of herself, but I have never yetseen a moral slave exhibit any moralshame whatsoever; they are tooethically corrupt to be able to show anytrue perspective....; there is the master and there is the slave;the noble and the serf; the \"lone wolf\"and the herd.

Race, birth, breeding, etc.are important but not absolutelyessential factors.)Again he is mistaken: race, birth andbreeding are, at this time, not importantat all, because fifteen hundred years ofChristism have protected the slave—typeat the expense of the master—type.Therefore, it is extremely rare to find atrue master—type among people whohave social position, \"noble\" birth, orwealth. One is reminded of the remark ofa member of the new Napoleon nobilityto a member of the old Bourbon nobilityin France: \"The nobility of my family,Monsieur, starts with me; the nobility ofyours obviously ended with yourself.\"(Nietzsche may be regarded as one of ourprophets; to a much less extent, deGobineau.)

Britons will neverget together about anything unless anduntil each one of them feels himselfdirectly threatened.Patriotism is a nice thing, but should bekept under a very firm rein. Of course, atthe time he could hardly foresee what\"Socialism,\" Marxist indoctrination, andpenetration of Anglicanism by theVatican would do to England; except thathe had prophesied the whole mess in\"Carmen Saeculare\" right before thebeginning of this century, and thus oughtto have known better!Now here I must tell you a story which maythrow a good deal of light on much that isobscure in the political situation of '25 to"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"date.

Incidentally, Ihad the conveniences for conferring uponNeuberg the degree of Neophyte, hehaving passed brilliantly through thisyear as a Probationer.I consequently asked him and an Emmanuelman named Kenneth Ward, to come andstay with me. I had met Ward atWastdale Head shortly before, havinggone there to renew my ancient loveswith the creeds of the gullies. Ithappened that Ward was very keen onskiing. I had several pairs and offered togive him some. This casual circumstanceproved an essential part of the chain bywhich I was ultimately dragged behindthe chariot of the Secret Chiefs. At least Ithought it was a chain. I did not realizethat steel of such exquisite temper mightbe beaten into a sword fit for the hand ofa free man.To my annoyance, I could not find theElemental Watch Towers anywhere in thehouse.

This town is so hideous anddepressing that we felt that our onlychance of living through the night was toget superbly drunk, which we did . . .Here Crowley added the followingparenthesis:Let me emphasize that thiswild adventure had not the remotestconnection with Magick. Virakam wasutterly ignorant of the subject. She hadhardly so much as a smattering ofChristian Science. She had neverattended a séance or played Planchette.... Lassati sed non Satiati by midnight, Iexpected to sleep; but was aroused byVirakam being apparently seized with aviolent attack of hysteria, in which shepoured forth a frantic torrent of senselesshallucination. I was irritated and tried tocalm her. But she insisted that herexperience was real; that she bore animportant message to me from someinvisible individual. Such nonsenseincreased my irritation. But—after aboutan hour of it—my jaw fell withastonishment. I became suddenly awareof a coherence in her ravings, and furtherthat they were couched in my ownlanguage of symbols. My attention beingthus awakened, I listened to what she wassaying. A few minutes convinced me thatshe was actually in communication withsome Intelligence who had a message forme.Let me briefly explain the grounds for thisbelief. I have already set forth, in"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"connection with the Cairo Working, someof the safeguards which I habituallyemploy. Virakam's vision containedelements perfectly familiar to me. Thiswas clear proof that the man in hervision, whom she called Ab-ul-Diz, wasacquainted with my system ofhieroglyphics, literal and numerical, andalso with some incidents in my MagicalCareer. Virakam herself certainly knewnothing of any of these. Ab-ul-Diz told usto call him a week later, when he wouldgive further information. We arrived atSt. Moritz and engaged a suite in thePalace Hotel.My first surprise was to find that I hadbrought with me exactly those MagicalWeapons which were suitable for thework proposed, and no others. But a yetmore startling circumstance was tocome. For the purpose of the CairoWorking, Ouarda and I had bought twoabbai; one, scarlet, for me; one, blue, forher. I had brought mine to St. Moritz; theother was of course in the possession ofOuarda. Imagine my amazement whenVirakam produced from her trunk a blueabbai so like Ouarda's that the onlydifference were minute details of the goldembroidery! The suggestion was that theSecret Chiefs, having chosen Ouarda astheir messenger, could not use any oneelse until she had become irrevocablydisqualified by insanity.It might be more appropriate to say thatThey chose no other until she resignedher position by choosing to go insanerather than to continue as ScarletWoman. Cf. AL III 43.Not till now could her place be taken byanother; and that Virakam should possessa duplicate of her Magical Robe seemed astrong argument that she had beenconsecrated by Them to take the place of"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"her unhappy predecessor.She was very unsatisfactory as aclairvoyant; she resented theseprecautions. She was a quick-temperedand impulsive woman, always eager to actwith reckless enthusiasm. My coldscepticism no doubt prevented her fromdoing her best. Ab-ul-Diz himselfconstantly demanded that I should show\"faith,\" and warned me that I waswrecking my chances by my attitude. Iprevailed upon him, however, to giveadequate proof of his existence, and hisclaim to speak with authority. The mainpurport of his message was to instruct meto write a book on my system ofMysticism and Magick, to be called Book4, and told me that by means of this book,I should prevail against public neglect. Isaw no objection to writing such a book;on quite rational grounds, it was a propercourse of action. I therefore agreed to doso. But Ab-ul-Diz was determined todictate the conditions in which the bookshould be written; and this was a difficultmatter. He wanted us to travel to anappropriate place. On this point I wasnot wholly satisfied with the result of mycross-examination. I know now that Iwas much to blame throughout. I was nothonest either with him, myself, orVirakam. I allowed materialconsiderations to influence me, and Iclung—oh triple fool!—to my sentimentalobligations towards Laylah.Triple fool because Laylah showed no suchqualms when time came to follow herown inclinations at his expense. As isusually the case.We finally decided to do what he asked,though part of my objection was foundedon his refusal to give us absolutelydefinite instruction. However, we crossedthe Passes in a sleigh to Chiavenna,"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"whence we took the train to Milan. Inthis city we had a final conversation withAb-ul-Diz. I had exhausted his patience,as he mine, and he told us that he wouldnot visit us any more. He gave us his finalinstructions. We were to go to Rome,though he refused to name the exactspot. We were to take a villa and therewrite Book 4. I asked him how we mightrecognize the right Villa. I forget whatanswer he gave through her, but for thefirst time he flashed a message directlyinto my own consciousness. \"You willrecognize it beyond the possibility ofdoubt or error,\" he told me. With this apicture came into my mind of a hillsideon which were a house and gardenmarked by two tall Persian Nuts.The next day we went on to Rome. Owingto my own Ananias-like attempt to \"keepback part of the price,\" my relations withVirakam had become strained. Wereached Naples after two or threequarrelsome days in Rome and beganhouse-hunting. I imagined that we shouldfind dozens of suitable places to choosefrom, but we spent day after day scouringthe city and suburbs in an automobile,without finding a single place to let thatcorresponded in the smallest degree withour ideas.Virakam's brat—a most god-forsaken lout—was to join us for the Christmas holidays,and on the day he was due to arrive wemotored out as a forlorn hope toPosilippo before meeting him at thestation at 4 o'clock or thereabouts. Butthe previous night Virakam had a dreamin which she saw the desired villa withabsolute clearness.

At one point there is asmall side lane scarcely negotiable bymotor, and indeed hardly perceptible, asit branches from the main road so as toform an acute-angled \"Y\" with the foottowards Naples. But Virakam sprangexcitedly to her feet, and told thechauffeur to drive down it. I wasastonished, she being hysterically anxiousto meet the train, and our time beingalready almost too short. But she sworepassionately that the villa was down thatlane. The road became constantlyrougher and narrower. After some time,it came out on the open slope; a low stoneparapet of the left protecting it. Againshe sprang to her feet. \"There,\" she cried,pointing with her finger, \"is the Villa Isaw in my dream!\" I looked. No villa wasvisible. I said so. She had to agree; yetstuck to her point that she saw it. Isubsequently returned to that spot andfound that a short section of wall, perhaps15 feet of narrow edge of masonry, is justperceptible through a gap in thevegetation.We drove on; we came to a tiny piazza, onone side of which was a church. \"That isthe square and the Church,\" sheexclaimed, \"that I saw in my dream!\"We drove on. The lane became narrower,rougher and steeper. Little more than100 yards ahead it was completely \"up,\"blocked with heaps of broken stone. Thechauffeur protested that he would be ableneither to turn the car nor to back it up tothe square. Virakam, in a violent rage,insisted on proceeding. I shrugged myshoulders.

On the left was awide open gate through which we couldsee a gang of workmen engaged inpretending to repair a ramshackle villa. Virakam called the foreman and asked inbroken Italian if the place was to let. Hetold her no; it was under repair. Withcrazy confidence she dragged him withinand forced him to show her over thehouse. I sat in resigned disgust, notdeigning to follow. Then my eyessuddenly saw down the garden, two treesclose together. I stooped. Their topsappeared. They were Persian Nuts! Thestupid coincidence angered me, and yetsome irresistible instinct compelled meto take out my note book and pencil andjot down the name written over the gate— Villa Caldarazzo. Idly I added up theletters. Their sum struck me like a bulletin my brain. It was 418, the number ofthe Magical Formula of the Aeon, anumerical hieroglyph of the Great Work. Ab-ul-Diz had made no mistake. Myrecognition of the right place was not todepend on a mere matter of trees, whichmight be found almost anywhere. Recognition beyond all possibility ofdoubt was what he promised. He hadbeen as good as his word.I was entirely overwhelmed. I jumped outof the car and ran up to the house. Ifound Virakam in the main room. Theinstant I entered I understood that it wasentirely suited for a temple. The wallswere decorated with crude frescoes whichsomehow suggested the exact atmosphereproper to the Work. The very shape ofthe room seemed somehow significant. Further, it seemed as if it were filled witha peculiar emanation. This impressionmust not be dismissed as sheer fancy. Few men but are sufficiently sensitive todistinguish the spiritual aura of certain"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"buildings.Although, naturally, one's interpretation ofwhat is a \"good\" aura will varyaccording to one's spiritual inclinationsor development.It is impossible not to feel reverence incertain cathedrals and temples.One should always do the Banishinggesture and pronounce the Banishingwords when entering such places,however. Interestingly enough themajority of Christist \"churches\" have atotally miasmic atmosphere; but theBanishing immediately reveals thosethat — statistically exceptions — seem tohave been charged with true veneration.The entrance of an Initiate in any suchchurches and temples, of course, purifiesthem. Which is added motivation toavoid entering them.The most ordinary dwelling houses oftenpossess an atmosphere of their own;some depress, some cheer; some disgust,others strike chill to the heart.Virakam of course was entirely certain thatthis was the Villa for us. Against this wasthe positive statement of the people incharge that it was not to be let. Werefused to accept this assertion. We tookthe name and address of the owner, dughim out, and found him willing to give usimmediate possession at a small rent. We went in on the following day, andsettled down almost at once to consecratethe Temple and begin the book.The beginning of the next account carries,in the original edition, another footnotefrom Mr. Germer which has beenmodified by Israel Regardie in his piracyto advertise another piracy — that ofSymonds and Grant.
