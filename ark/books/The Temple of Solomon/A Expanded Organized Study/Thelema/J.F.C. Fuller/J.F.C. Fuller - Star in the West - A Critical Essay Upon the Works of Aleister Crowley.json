This however I trust he will find is not the case,and, as Ianthe, will discover that after the mystic union has beenconsummated, the beautiful daughter of Ligdus and Telethusa was asacceptable a young husband as ever wooed nymph on the shaded slopes ofIda.Much has been written concerning stars, both terrestrial and celestial, andnot a little regarding that capricious star which gleamed over the humblemanger-bed of the Son of Man.Dark seas of blood have long since lapped that star of the morning into thecrimson oblivion of day, whose empurpled strife has also rumbled into thedistance as the droning of some drowsy fire-finger on the sleepingparchment of life, murmuring and moaning as the wind-kissed mouth of adreamy drum. Yet why should we still listen for those subtle sounds whichhave wearily danced out their slow saraband of sorrow. Once Orphic theyarose emparadising the cavernous depths of Hell, to sink into a dirge-likeNiobe death-chaunt, bewailing the thirteen children of their begetting, risingonce more in the song of Ligeia, enticing men to her mire, and at length todie still-voiced as the daughter of Dis, whose ghostly fingers sinking clutchthe frozen reeds of that slough in which she had so long wallowed.Long have we peered, crouching on the watch-tower of our minds, throughthe darkness of ignorance lit alone by the northern lights of folly, till our"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"scorched eyes falling as slags upon our hearts, a light celestial hath arisenfrom out the eyeless sockets of Eternity.

A Pharos of gleaming hope lighting our wayacross the boisterous ocean of life to our haven of eternal rest.The fools and the faulty, the wise and the wizened read and tremble beforethe might of its majesty, for into its flaming horrent hath it woven andbraided the ashen locks of wisdom, the dyed curls of folly, and all theglittering circlets of golden youth. All is transcended, all is unified andtranscendental; neither is there joy nor laughter, sorrow nor weeping, for allis as a divine mastery of Truth and Knowledge to those who worship thenew-born God, like the Magi of the East, with gold, and frankincense, andmyrrh. Above whose heptagonal cradle flashes the magic star Lusanaher,that great star Cor Leonis, which heralds and directs our reverent pilgrimage.The Star has arisen; let us like men drop the silly pretence of an ostrich-likeself-delusion that the cindery asteroid still lights our way; let us rather applyour mental spectroscope to the analysis of its rays. There shall we perchancediscover the blending of all opposites in one harmonious light; thence shallwe travel to the holy and humble house of the heart, wherein our God isborn, whose name is ineffable, a Crown of Glory, exalted forever above theBalance of Righteousness and Truth. T.A.R.O.As author of the following essay to you my readers, I can but say with thefour beasts of the Apocalypse: “Come and See.”“Behold the Lion... hath prevailed to open the Book and to loose the sevenseals thereof.” For until now “No man in heaven, nor in earth, neither underthe earth, was able to open the Book, neither to look thereon.” Yet throughthe astrolabe of his mind and in the alembic of his heart Aleister Crowleyhas opened the book, breaking not only the first six seals, but the seventhalso. For those who read and understand, the heavens shall depart as a scroll,and the stars shall fall, and the mountains be moved out of their places; andthey shall become as kings in a new kingdom, and be crowned with thatCrown which passes Understanding."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I have attempted in the following seven chapters to interpret the Book of theSeven Seals, and to paint its splendour, as an artist would incarnadine hiscanvas with the red blood of his mistress, love-kissed from the bloom of hercrimson lips. I have not, as Samuel, hacked and hewn Agag into piecesbefore the Lord in Gilgal; but rather Elijah-like have called upon Wisdomand Understanding so that my sacrifice, and even the wood and stone of thealtar, and the water which floweth about it, may be licked up by the fire ofthe great Coronation.As another Ariadne I here offer this work to my readers as a twisted clue ofsilk and hemp to guide them safely through the labyrinthine mysteries ofpoetry and magic, whose taurine crags hug the blue sky, amorous as thekisses of Pasiphae; across the Elysian fields of myrtle and asphodel, up theeagle-crested slopes of Olympus, and over the shining sun-scorched sands ofAmmon, tawny and silken as the crouching form of some colossal lion, tothe cool groves of Eleusis child-like dreaming in the bosom of silvery Atticaby the blue Ægean sea.Yet those who would drink deeper of the wine of this magical Eucharist,spilt with due reverence on the pages of this volume, they must seek it in theSibylline verses of those books from which this one has drawn its life-blood.And they are:Aceldama.

It has been a difficult task. Insimple words and complex symbols Crowley has written with St. Leo—“Know, O man, thy dignity;” and this I have in this essay attempted toexplain, though many I am afraid will misunderstand me, and more stillmisinterpret my modest efforts. For these latter ones I can but exclaim:“Caeterum scis quid ego cogitem, scortum scorteum; Di tibi dent, nudosquelares inopemque senectam et longas hyemes perpetuam que sitim.”And for those former, bid them contemplate well the words of St. Augustine:“Such as the love of man is, such is he himself. Dost thou love the earth?Thou art earth. Dost thou love God? What shall I say? Thou art God.” J.F.C.F."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"FOREWORDIN “Frazer’s Magazine” of November, 1866, may be found the following:“Wherever there is any kind of true genius, we have no right to drive it madby ridicule or invective; we must deal with it wisely, justly, fairly. Some ofthese passages which have been selected as evidence of (the poet’s) plainspeaking, have been wantonly misunderstood. The volume, as a whole, isneither profane nor indecent. A little more clothing in our uncertain climatemight perhaps have been attended with advantage... To us this volume, forthe first time, conclusively settles that Mr.— is not a mere brilliantrhetorician or melodious twanger of another man’s lyre, but authentically apoet.”So writes the critic. The name I have omitted is that of the last of the greatVictorian poets, Algernon Charles Swinburne. In the dying glory of this lastgreat singer of the nineteenth century, the deepening twilight shows but fewrising stars; alone perhaps amid the younger generation of poets – alas, howmany and yet how few – Aleister Crowley stands forth with no little of theglory of the great Victorian cast o’er him; enhancing our pleasures, andenchanting our senses. The Sun kisses the Moon, and through thediaphanous veil of the vestal is seen the subtle contour of her form. But novestal is Crowley, no mere milk-and-bun-walk, where we may rest and takeour fill; for he has unstrung the mystic lyre of life from the tree of theKnowledge of Good and of Evil, singing old songs and new, flinging shrillnotes of satire to this tumultuous world, as some stormy petrel shrilly cryingto the storm; or sweet notes of love, soft as the whispering wings of abutterfly.Here are the jewels of Heaven, of Havilah, and of Eden, with not a little ofthe fire of Hell, the flames of Gehenna, and the darkness of Dûat. If we lookfor pyramids and colossi disappointment will be our lot; we cannot hold, asHanuman of Ind, a mountain in one hand and a forest in the other, neithercan we gaze on a celestial Meru or Olympus; but as we look, and here it isonly the searcher who is rewarded, we find a little jewel, then another, andstill another, till, as we grasp them, their very light is caught by their"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"unfound fellows, and our path is lit as a fairy dell by a thousand wonders oflight and of beauty.“A little more clothing,” the critic writes, as he perused the “Poems andBallads,” perhaps, yet we do not feel its need in the glowing works beforeus. Forty long years have passed, and the world moves. Crowley fairly putshis characters to bed, tucks them up, and does not blow the candle out withcryptic Morse-like dot and dash, leaving the imagination to wallow in thedark, intelligible to the baby-mind of sucklings, and we admire him all themore for not doing so; his undraped virginity is delightful, and if hismaidens lack vestments and his matrons mantles, it is a hearty sight, a robustsight, it flushes the drains of our mind, and discloses a heart lying beneathall the conventional tweeds and silks of our sleek respectability. The staleodour of Mrs. Grundy’s petticoats vanishes, neither is it replaced by thepatchouli of Thais, nor the musk of Aspasia; and if the aroma of a littlehuman sweat does salute our nostrils, it is at least a healthy human smell –an odour of sanctity – infinitely preferable to all the ancient pot-pourri ofPhilistia, that young and old ladies are alike so fond of distributing amongtheir pretty speeches, as well as their pretty garments.“Is life, then, to resolve itself for us into a chain of exhilarating pangs?”asked Pallas, in Mr. Gosse’s “Hypolympia,” in answer to the query ofÆsculapius, “What is pleasure?” We see the mortal form of the immortalhealer climbing along the jutting cornice of some cliff, in search for thesimples of life; and as the zephyrs waft his long ashen locks around hisfurrowed brow, his trembling hand clutches some rugged crag, more perhapsfrom joy than fear. And so, as we now open the works of Aleister Crowley,we are filled with an exhilarating chain of pangs; mortal-like we are neversated, and as our lips taste the nectar of true poetry we tremblingly clutch thecrags of Parnassus in search for the Asphodel of Love, Wisdom, and Beauty.Here, as we turn some beetling height, the dying rays of the Swinburnian sunsink, those rays that ruffled the vestal purity of the clouds to the rosy blushof a lover’s kiss, and in the departing light we again find the mystic Trinitymidst the hellebore and thistles of existence, enthroned, eternal. The sunsinks, and the last notes of the nightingale die into the stillness of fallingnight. The emerald sky like the robe of some car-borne Astarté, slashed withan infinite orange and red, fades into the sombre garment of night; andabove silently breaks a primal sea gemmed with all the colours of the opal,deepening into a limitless amethyst, darkens, and the sun goes out. Thespangled pall of Night is drawn, and the lull of death is o’er us; but no, hark!"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"the distant boom of a beetle is carried across the still glowing welkin, it isthe signal drum announcing the marriage of Night and Day.

Your loves shall lap up slaughter, And dabbled with roses of blood Each desperate darling daughter Shall swim in the fervid flood. I bring ye laughter and tears, The kisses that foam and bleed, The joys of a million years, The flowers that bear no seed. My life is bitter and sterile, Its flame is a wandering star.

Pregnant it certainly is, and more, being already the mother of alarge family, a family as diverse as the offspring of Uranus, father of theGods, born to him by Earth, earthy and celestial. Sweet lyrics are crushedcheek by jowl with the most corrosive satire, sonorous heroics and blankverse at times merge into the most raucous of Hudibrasian doggerel, rimes ofthe sweetest and the most perverse character ring in our astonished ear,tragedy and farce, ever extremes: Paul and Virginie sitting on the knees ofPantagruel, blowing kisses through the Sephirotic circle of eternity. At timeswe listen to the yearning hopes of a Paracelsus, or the noble words of aTannhäuser; at times warm arms are flung around us, and the hot kisses ofsome Messaline suffocate our very breath, leading us into the mansions of ade Sade and through the gardens of an Aretino, horrid with the frenzy ofEros. Or, again, we are treading with the sages of philosophy, or ‘midst thestars in search of the Psyche of events; dreams almost monstrous in theirintensity seize our troubled brain, deep problems of psychology, of sex, ofthe carnal, of the pathic, and of evil, all inter-webbed and woven with theeternal filament of good. And so if we read this strange poet aright, we shallsee as we progress onwards, that he has struck a sonorous note from the rimof Time, fulfilled of the knowledge of good and evil, sweet to the ears ofthose who are born children by the daughters of men to the sons of God,sweet as that mystic fruit was to the lips of Eve, daughter of God, child ofthe mystic Man. But we must speed on, taking in this chapter swift glancesat the magnificent scenery that these volumes offer up to us, plucking thelilies of spring and the roses of summer, and weave them into a laureatewreath with the fiery leaves of the dying year.*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 166."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Poe, in that little masterpiece of his, “The Poetic Principle,” lays down thatthe value of a poem lies in the ratio of its elevating excitement, theexcitement being the power it has in elevating the soul. And here we think,were Poe still living, he would have found no small part of his ideal realized.By soul we naturally do not mean a haloed fowl strumming dithyrambs on aharp, or the mere döppelganger of the living; but that inner power of goodand evil which lies latent in self, controlled by that intuitive consciousnesswithin us, and manifested in our appetites and desires; this intangible soulaspiring upwards is called Virtue, sinking downwards Vice; finding infinityin the conceptions of nether and upper, heaven and hell, paradise andgehenna; and finality on earth – its sporting ground. Further Poe states: thatan epic was of itself a nullity, and that a poem of great length, commencingas it might in exaltation, ended in nine cases out of ten in somnolence.Poetry must stimulate, it must irritate the soul in some definite manner, orelse it ceases to be poetry. For when once poetry exerts a soporific power itswhole object is lost, and, as a flash of lightning, it must he vivid, bright,flaming for a moment, awful, eloquent, rushing from the darkness of nightthrough the flashing elements of day into the silence of eternity.And this is exactly the poetry we here find. No poems are of any greatlength, no poems here contain a labour on the part of the reader to attain theend,* though in some places the labours of Hercules seem insignificantcompared with the labours of mental unknotting, but even in such places(where the sense becomes tangled in the reader’s mind)’ he loses none of thebeauty of rime and rhythm, he never becomes bored, never weary. Set in thepure gold of verse and line, lie lyrics of surpassing beauty: Tannhäuser (thelongest of the poems) would be a magnificent contemplation even if we cutfrom it its sparkling songs, but with them it becomes superb, neither arethere too many; the queen of our poet’s ideals is no gilded prostitute, noTheodora hung with a myriad flashing jewels, but rather some chastepriestess carrying on her breast the mystic symbol of Isis, whose belt is ajewelled Zodiac, and in whose hand is the eternal Ankh. *Except perhaps in Orpheus.This interspersing of lyrics has been carried to a charming intensity ofexpression and their effect on the mind is one full of joy, no cloying, nosurfeit, no repletion; the variety of the dishes is extraordinary in delicacy andpiquancy as well as in number."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The morals of a nation can with fair accuracy be gauged from the conditionof its arts and literature, and in what a state are ours? Our music the janglingditties of the streets, our paintings, posters and bedizened Jewesses; and ourliterature, heroically vulgar, vulgarly obscene, and obscenely insipid.Morals, the nation has none, merely a better art in disguising than in formertimes, that is all. We no longer can produce a Swift, a Congreve, or aDryden, a Smollett, a Lever, or a Sterne, and yet our writers are legion – andas feculent as the flabby prostitutes of the street. The facetiae of the fifteenthcentury, “Les Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles,” “The Decameron,” “TheHeptameron,” “The Nights of Straparola,” “Brantôme,” etc., etc., are notonly masterpieces for all time, but are pure, even chaste, compared with thevirginal lusts that are becoming so fashionable in our modern literature,whose maidens are Lesbians, and whose heroes are satyrs. Europa is nolonger satisfied with her bull, but seeks an ichor-maddened elephant; Ledadisdains her swan, and burns for a straddling ostrich; the goat of lechery sitsenthroned o’er us, and is fast coupling with the mind of the nation, andspawning offspring effeminate, lustful, and degenerate. Tribades with theirevil-smelling kisses swarm over our pages, heroines are no longer satisfiedwith mere men, but must strain to their breasts legless monsters; whilst ahero will listen to his loved one snorting in the arms of some lusty Păthān.Such literature is revolting, not in its mere descriptions, for these are nothingto the student, being generally but poorly described realities, but they arehorrible when strewn broadcast among the children of the nation. We stillhave our Bible and need no more erotica. Filth has been defined as matterout of place, and so is this pathic literature, relegated to the realms of sexualpsychology in the works of an Ellis or an Ebing is one thing, yet thegovernment of this nation cannot stomach them thus, and seizes, expels, andburns; but if these horrid sores of the human soul are cut out and plasteredon the pages of the fickle fiction of the day, then are they passed in seductivecovers as proper nourishment for the nation; and devoured with relish andavidity. One minute, impatient reader, for I hear you mutter: “Are not thesevery aberrations set forth with no mean lustre on the pages of the works ofAleister Crowley?” Listen. Have any of Crowley’s works been printedpueris virginibusque? Are they intended for the gaping public? Are theydevoured by mental babes and sucklings, or worse, forcibly crammed downtheir throats in simple or other forms? I think not. To some it may seemcurious that these poems are published by a society called “The Society forthe Propagation of Religious Truth.” By whom is the Bible published? Is itnot also a religious society, and is the Bible immaculate? Was it not Sir"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Richard Burton, the greatest of Orientalists, who resolved in case the rabidpornophobic suggestions of certain ornaments of the home press were actedupon, to appear in court with the Bible and Shakespeare under one arm, andPetronius Arbiter and Rabelais under the other? And I remember a certainsentence – characteristic of the man – he was describing those people whoare unable to read crude texts, arid needs must have them bowdlerized andexpurgated, lest they fall into a priapic frenzy: “The man must be prurientand lecherous as a dog-faced baboon in rut to have aught of passion excitedby either.”This is all true enough; but I must call a halt. I had not intended here to writea series of apologetics, for I leave that to the poet and his pen, who can welllook after themselves; but what I wished to point out was the deplorablestate into which our literature has fallen. Its ever increasing demand forsensation has been its destruction; everyone now is a mental Trimalchiowhose appetite has to be awakened by the most piquant and fantastic ofdishes. Scott, Dickens, and Thackeray are still (I believe) read by an everdecreasing number of school-girls; Flaubert, Gautier and Balzac – whowould have shocked the youthful years of our parents – have become dulland tedious; a few cranks praise Tourgenief, Tolstoi and Gorky, whilst oneout of every hundred thousand may know that there was such a man asDostoieffsky. And poetry, O greatest of the Muses, thy fate is truly a sadone! Much verse is produced which might be placed with last year’s storelists – you know where; some is distinctly good, but it is soon lost in theraging sea of poetic dialect, and hackneyed naïveté. Here and there we comeacross a charming lyric, which the carping whisky-and-water critic will atonce demolish as weak, troubled, vague, etc., etc. Not long ago my eyes liton the following which I considered a charming verse from a poetic point ofview, if not from that of a morbid anatomist: Look down into the river. Can you see The mingled images the water shows? So lies my soul in yours. As close as lie The folded petals in an unblown rose. Yet the little thing who “stinks and stings” was not satisfied, the secondmetaphor actually weakened the effect of the first, etc., etc. With such havepoets to contend, but I do not think such homunculi worry Aleister Crowleymuch. His poetry is his own, and he gives it us as it is written without"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"respect of persons or opinions, for his masters have been the greatest of ourrace.In these poems we find a certain preponderance of Swinburne, Blake,Browning, Keats, Shelley, and Rossetti. In the dedication to “Jephthah,”which is addressed to Algernon Charles Swinburne, we read the following: As streams get water of the sun-smit sea, Seeking my ocean and my sun in thee.**Jephthah, vol. i, p. 66.And this discipleship to the greatest and last of the Victorian poets has givenus many a subtle and enthralling line. The scene when Charicles wakes andcatches Archais to his breast is worthy of the bard who sang of “Tristramand Iseult.” It is as follows: He sprang, he caught her to his breast; the maid Smiled and lay back to look at him. He laid Her tender body on the sloping field,And felt her sighs in his embraces yieldA sweeter music than all birds. But she,Lost in the love she might not know, may seeNo further than his face, and yet, awareOf her own fate, resisted like a snare.Her own soft wishes. As she looked and sawHis eager face, the iron rod of lawGrew like a misty pillar in the sky.In all her veins the blood’s desires die,And then – O sudden ardour! – all her mind And memory faded, and looked outward, blind, Beyond their bitterness. Her arms she flung Around him, and with amorous lips and tongue Tortured his palate with extreme desire, And like a Mænad maddened; equal fire Leapt in his veins; locked close for love they lie, The heart’s dumb word exprest without a sigh In the strong magic of a lover’s kiss.* *The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 11."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"These superb lines, like those of Swinburne, are in reality a series of brilliantlyrical illustrations depicting the story in measures of divine song. More wefind in this same poem, and in others also; the following fine sonnet entitled“The Summit of the Amorous Mountain,” is distinctly Swinburnian; I give itin its entirety:To love you, Love, is all my happiness; To kill you with my kisses; to devourYour whole ripe beauty in the perfect hourThat mingles us in one supreme caress; To drink the purple of your thighs; to press Your beating bosom like a living flower; To die in your embraces, in the showerThat dews like death your swooning loveliness. To know you love me; that your body leaps With the quick passion of your soul; to know Your fragrant kisses sting my spirit so; To be one soul where Satan smiles and sleeps— Ah! in the very triumph-hour of Hell Satan himself remembers whence he fell!**The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 181.Again, such lines as these from the “Triumph of Man”:And all the earth is blasted; the green sward Burns where it touches, and the barren sodRejects the poison of the blood of God. . . . . . . . . . . . . . To tread base thoughts as our high thoughts have trod, Deep in the dust, the carrion that was God;**Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, pp. 106, 107.remind us strongly of such pieces as “Before a Crucifix,” whilst others takeus into the mystic and simple land of Blake, such as the duet of Chariclesand Archais:"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Hush! the music swells apace, Rolls its silver billows up Through the void demesne of space To the heavens’ azure cup! Hush, my love, and sleep shall sigh This is immortality!**The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 27.Other lines again hold us enthralled with the extraordinary power theycontain, expressed in a single word. Thus in the poem “The Lesbian Hell,”we find ourselves in the unutterable void of Orcus, where kisses are flung invain, and where around us pale women fleet: Whose empty fruitlessness assails the night With hollow repercussion, like dim tombs Wherein some vampire glooms.* *The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 185.This last line is one of the most expressive ever written by Crowley, and inthe last word “glooms” is concentrated more than terror or fear, a broodingunnameable horror, comparable to the word “crowd” that Blake makes useof in his “Mad Song”: Like a fiend in a cloud. With howling woe After night I do crowd And with night will go. Both poets have chosen here not the only word that could be chosen, but theonly word that would in the above poems express the maximum amount, ofhorror in the one case; and of desire in the other.Very different from Blake do we find such a poem as “Vespers,” which,though differing in rime, in cadence and spirit; is reminiscent of Rossetti’s“Blessed Damozel”:Still in those avenues of light,No maid, with golden zone,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"And lily garment that from sightHalf hides the ivory throne,Lay in my arms the livelong nightTo call my soul her own.** Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 53.Whilst parts of the poem “Messaline” with which “Alice” opens remind usof poor “Jenny.”Tennyson, if we are to judge from the introduction to “Alice,” does not seemto hold a very high position in the opinion of Aleister Crowley. “He is aneurasthenic counter-jumper” certainly would not have pleased Poe, whoregarded him as the noblest poet that ever lived. Nevertheless we find tracesof the great laureate’s work in these poems, such as the idea contained in thefollowing verse of “De Profundis”:I have dreamed life a circle or a line, Called God, and Fate, and Chance, and Man, divine. I know not all I say, but through it all Mark the dim hint of ultimate sunshine!**Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 113.which is almost identical with that in Canto LIV of “In Memoriam.” A poemwritten in the metre of Tennyson’s most famous work, yet differing incadence, is “The Blood Lotus.” Quaint carven vampire bats, unseen in curious hollows of thetrees,Or deadlier serpents coiled at ease round carcases of birdsunclean;All wandering changeful spectre shapes that dance in slowsweet measure roundAnd merge themselves in the profound, nude women anddistorted apesGrotesque and hairy, in their rage more rampant than thestallion steed;"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"There is no help: their horrid need on these pale women theyassuage.**Oracles, vol. ii, p. 13.Another poem that in parts reminds us of the “In Memoriam” is “TheNameless Quest,” such lines as:I was wed Unto the part, and could not grasp the whole.**The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 191.breathe a great and similar doubt. As in many respects the agnosticism ofTennyson’s “In Memoriam” resembles the atheistic free thought ofFitzGerald’s “Omar Khayyám,” so do both the above-mentioned poems, andthe first is of similar metre, its quatrains containing, as those of the poet ofKhorassán, flights of great power of thought; the following five quatrains arewell worth quoting:We weep them as they slip away; we gaze Back on the likeness of the former days— The hair we fondle and the lips we kiss— Roses grow yellow and no purple stays.. . . . . . . . . . . . .Why not with time?

(The metre though not the cadenceis that of “Laus Veneris.”)Whilst such lines as the following in the second poem also remind us of theastronomer poet: O thou, zelator of this Paradise, Tell thou the secret of’ the pillar! None Can hear thee, of the souls beneath the sun. Speak! or the very Godhead in thee dies. For we are many, and thy name is One.**The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 191.Before we leave the glowing east, one more curious similarity still strikes us,it is that though in so many ways the ideas of Aleister Crowley are akin tothose of Omar Khayyám, yet his fertile imagination also engenders flights asspiritual as those contained in the melodious ghazals of Jeláladdín. In morethan one place we come across lines similar to these in Tannhäuser: I say, then, “I;” and yet it is not “I” Distinct, but “I” incorporate in All. I am the Resurrection and the Life! The work is finished, and the Night rolled back!I am the rising Sun of Life and Light,The Glory of the Shining of the Dawn!I am Osiris! I the Lord of LifeTriumphant over death—O Sorrow, Sorrow, Sorrow of the World!**Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 261.That such similarities as we have pointed out above show Aleister Crowleyto be a copyist, must be far from the minds of all his readers.

The mere fact that certain forms of thought and modes ofexpression occur here as they have occurred elsewhere, should he as aliterary barometer, enabling us to judge the mental standard of the writer. Allgreat writers will have many points in common. It is more than probable thatAleister Crowley had already read most of Shakespeare before he wrote“The Mother’s Tragedy,” and yet, because of this we should not necessarilysay that the following magnificent lines were due to the influence of thegreat master, notwithstanding the fact that they are in many respects equal tomuch of his best:Your breath, that burns upon me, wraps me round With whirling passion, pierces through my veins With its unhallowed fire, constrains, compels, Drags out the corpse of twenty years agoFrom the untrusty coffin of my mind,To poison, to corrupt, to strike you thereBlind with its horror.**The Mother’s Tragedy, vol. i, p. 160.Many other pieces are almost equally grand, the last speech of Tannhäuser toHeinrich is truly magnificent:And verilyMy life was borne on the dark stream of deathDown whirling aeons, linked abysses, columnsBuilt of essential time...**Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 261.In “The Violet’s Love Story,”*1. or in “Dora,”*2. we have as simple a poemas could be written, and in one of the verses of a chorus in “Jephthah,”beginning “There flashes the heart of a rose,”*3. one of the most mystical.Here is a furious inspiration in blank verse (the prophet in “Jephthah”speaks):*1.

Herewe will give but one or two curious examples, dealing with the great songsof love in the next chapter. As a singer of love-songs Aleister Crowleyexcels. The following is from “The Star and the Garter”:Your lips are gathered up to mine; Your bosom heaves with fearful breath; Your scent is keen as floral wine, Inviting me, and love, to death.**The Star and the Garter, vol. iii, p. 11.Also the following is charming in its simplicity:She has a lithe white body, slimAnd limber, fairy-like, a snakeHissing some Babylonian hymnTangled in the Assyrian brake.**The Star and the Garter, vol. iii, p. 10.A curious Swinburnian strain of passion is found wedged in the satiric linesof “Why Jesus Wept.” Percy, the youth flatulent with love, chants to hisAngela – society – thus: To me she is The rosy incarnation of a kiss, The royal rapture of a young delight, The mazy music of virginity, Sun of the day, moon of the night,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"All, all to me!**Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 39.And again: Love, love, these raptures are like springtide rain Nestling among green leaves.**Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 40.One more example of the diversity of Crowley’s pen, before we deal withhis place in the history of poetry. In the “God-Eater” we come across a mostweird form of poetic imagination in the chants of Rupha – the hag ofEternity: Crafty! Crafty! That is the omen. Fear not the foemen! [She rises up. Mine is the spoil Of the grimly toil. Gloomy, gloomy! Ah! but I laugh. He is but a fool. He has lost! He is lost! Take the staff! Trace the rule Of the circle crossed!* *The God-Eater, vol. ii, p. 135.We have now seen, more or less, some of the chief influences which haveexerted their sway over our poet’s mind; and I think we have shown him tobe a worthy pupil of the great masters we have had occasion to name. Nowthat I have pointed out these certain influences, illustrating them by means ofa few quotations, I intend to enter more into the history of his poetry andalso the place it fills in the history of English poetry generally. This is notaltogether an easy matter. Firstly, in selecting distinctive specimens it isdifficult not to help being guided by individual taste; secondly, the labour of"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"sorting the finest out of the fine is a work which needs no small powers ofapplication; and thirdly, how often may not the individual selector be wrongin his choice? But this latter difficulty is easily overcome by the reader, whohas only to pick and choose for himself; the work of an appreciative essayistbeing merely that of producing a characteristic display of what he considersthe most attractive wares. It is not intended here in any way to assumeimmaculacy for our author, far from it, for faults are to be found here as inevery other work, great or small, false rime and metre, half a step left outhere and there, sometimes a whole one: but taking these poems as a whole,these lapses are remarkably few, and it must also be borne in mind that innearly every case they are intentional lapses from the orthodox rules ofpoetic cadence and metre. One command Crowley alone obeys, and that is:that all verse – rime, rhythm, and metre – to be considered as poetry, mustbe musical.* Without music there can be no poetry, at best but a kind ofpoetic prose as found in the Prophetic Books of Blake, and in the works ofWalt Whitman. Yet in Blake, I think, we do find many consistentirregularities, which have been entirely misunderstood by many of hiseditors and critics. However, it was not till Swinburne loomed athwart theconscious regularity of the Tennysonian era, a poetic pre-Raphaelite, that,strictly speaking, a conscious and musical irregularity became admissible,wedging its way in, and splitting up the metrical structure of perfectscansion.*As a good example I will quote the following opening lines of a sonnet addressed to“the Secretary of State,” by Wilson Bonchord in Poems composed in Prison: When Crime’s sad victim has been tried and brought Within the circle of the difficult sphere Which England’s penal statutes appoint him here: To expiate by patient toil and thought.Neither the second nor the third line scans; nevertheless the second is good, as it ismusical: the extra half-step in the word “difficult” carrying with it a difficulty, and thusemphasizing the meaning; whilst in the third, there is neither scansion nor music.In “Atalanta in Calydon” we find a further breaking away from the dramaticformalities inaugurated during the post-restoration era: Swinburne seeking amore perfect model in the old Tragedies of Greece. This had already beenpartially carried out by Keats, who definitely broke away from the Miltonicstyle of Wordsworth and Coleridge, and was more than half completed byhis contemporary, Shelley. But it was not till Swinburne himself seized thefinely-strung lyre of the unconsciously irregular author of “Prometheus,”and attuned it to the rustle of Blake’s angel-winged voice, that it can be said"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"that a certain system of irregularities in metre became admissible in theformal court of poetry.As the Rossetti brotherhood of painters returned to the stiff and simpleelegance as displayed in the “Primavera” of Botticelli, so did Swinburne goback to the simple beauty of Greek tragedy as depicted in Euripides.*Crowley does the same, as we see in “The Tale of Archais,” also in “TheMother’s Tragedy” and “The Fatal Force”; but in these two latter dramaswith this important difference, that instead of applying Greek style to Greekscenery, he applies it to a totally different end, namely to the expression ofmodern surroundings, or to his own intrinsic ideas, as in the last-named play,which, even more so than in “The Mother’s Tragedy” is, as we shall see lateron, a subtle discount on present-day morality. *Rather than Sophocles or Aeschylus.What Beardsley and Whistler did for art, Crowley is now doing for poetry.Beardsley, especially, succeeded Rossetti just as Crowley is nowsuperseding Swinburne. A poetic iconoclast to the very backbone, we findCrowley, especially in his later works, breaking away from every poeticconvention and restraint. At first it makes itself apparent in “The Star andthe Garter,” which was unwound from that same tangled skein from out ofwhich Browning had ravelled “Fifine,” and then, in the full power ofmanhood, in “Why Jesus Wept”; which one day will find its historic niche inthe temple of Poetry, somewhere between the “Hudibras” of Butler and the“Endymion” of Keats.Though Crowley, as can be clearly seen throughout his works, is not only agreat admirer but also a disciple of Browning’s, he nevertheless vigorouslyattacks that great master’s cacophony and wilful obscurity of meaning, inthat eccentric curiosity of diction “The Sword of Song,” in which our earsare assailed by the most monstrous diversity of noises, following in a rapidand dazzling succession till the ideas engendered in our brains are sportingin an outburst of mental leap-frog. The following are a few:“Fleas kill us” with “Aeschylus”“Trough hock lees” “ “Sophocles”“Globule us” “ “Aristobulus”**The Sword of Song, vol. ii, p. 145."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"And here is a good example:Let me help Babu Chander Grish up!As by a posset of HunyadiClear mind!

Sarasate,Such strains! Such music as once SadiMade Persia ring with! I who fish upNo such from soul may yet cry: VadeRetro Satanas! Tom Bond Bishop!**The Sword of Song, vol. ii, p. 148. Browning’s cacophony in “The Flight of theDuchess” is truly extraordinary:“Soul a stir up” with “streaky syrup” “Went trickle” “ “ventricle” “Sperm oil” “ “turmoil” “Wreathy hop” ““Æthiop” “Matters equine” “ “French weak wine.”We have mentioned “Why Jesus Wept” as one of the most irregular ofCrowley’s poems, yet its irregularities are regularly irregular throughout,bearing a similar relationship to a true poem like “Rosa Mundi” that a comicsong would to a great oratorio. “Why Jesus Wept” is a satiric farce, “RosaMundi” a great love anthem, almost we might say a Wagnerian opera inrime, and comparable in many respects in its continuous though irregularsymphony to the “Lycidas” of Milton. Yet, nevertheless, “Why Jesus Wept”is the more characteristic of the two, and certainly the most iconoclastic ofany.In “Orpheus,” Books I and II, we find a poetic regularity almost strictlyadhered to, not so, however, in Book III, and in “The Argonauts.” But it is"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"not till we get to “Rodin in Rime” that we find practically every sonnet andquatorzain possessing some infringement of the orthodox rules of poetry; yetit cannot be said that these poems, chiefly in iambic verse broken by theoccasional introduction of another foot, usually an anapaest, readunmusically on account of its presence. Take for instance: Cloistral seclusion of the galleried pines Is mine to-day: these groves are fit for Pan— O rich with Bacchic frenzy, and his wine’s Atonement for the infinite woe of man!**W.E. Henley, Rodin in Rime, vol. iii, p. 119.Here “cloistral” is a spondee; “eried pines,” an (imperfect) anapaest; and soon. Again in “La Fortune”: “Hail, Tyche! From the Amalthean horn Pour forth the store of love! I lowly bend Before thee: I invoke thee at the end When other gods are fallen and put to scorn. Thy foot is to my lips; my sighs unborn Rise, touch and curl about thy heart; they spend Pitiful love. Lovelier pity, descendAnd bring me luck who am lonely and forlorn.”**W.E. Henley, Rodin in Rime, vol. iii, p. 120. Compare the following verse inSwinburne’s poem, The Centenary of the Battle of the Nile:The strong and sunbright lie whose name was France Arose against the sun of truth, whose glanceLaughed large from the eyes of England fierce as fire Whence eyes wax blind that gaze in truth askance.Here “piti” is a trochee; “lovelier,” a spondee; “pity,” a trochee.

Bow down in awe! It is enough. The Gods are at feast. Withdraw!**Rodin in Rime, vol. iii, p. 119.Again the same mental stress.All the above are contrary to the rules of scansion, yet nevertheless they aremusical. And though in “Rodin in Rime” perhaps Crowley slightly overdoesthis introduction of irregular lines, yet they add a great charm, as they do inmany of his other poems, producing in their lingering pause or quick jumpan ecstatic spasm, if we may so call it, which renders so many of thesepoems unique. Such as in “Styx” we find:The fourth, to draw her kisses and to keep; The fifth, for love; the sixth, in sweet despair; The seventh, to destroy us unaware; The eighth, to dive within the infernal deep.**The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 183.“In” would scan better; but by replacing it by “within” we can feel the darkwaters close over us as we are borne down their unfathomable depths.Similarly in the following:Aching with all the pangs of night My shuddering body swoons; my eyes Absorb her eyelids’ lazy light, And read her bosom...* *Jezebel, vol. i, p. 131."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The extra half-step in “shuddering” in place of discordantly jarring on themetre produces a keener sense of agony in the reader’s mind than a wordwhich scanned correctly would do.In the next passage, taken from “Tannhäuser,” we find the introduction of aspondee carrying with it a curious sensation of slowness:Chaos, a speck; and space, a span; Ruinous cycles fallen in, And Darkness on the Deep of Time.

I will not say that they are the onlyimperfections to be found throughout these works, but I will say that thereare very few others. And considering that Aleister Crowley has written aboutone hundred thousand lines in the space of ten years, or half the quantityproduced by Robert Browning in fifty-six, the fewness of imperfections inhis work is truly remarkable.Let us now pass from what I may call the Poetic Iconomachy to the PoeticIconolatry of these poems; from Aleister Crowley’s war against poetic form,to his adoration of poetic imagery; and then to the keynote of the whole ofhis poetry, and, as we shall presently see, his philosophy as well, namely—Ecstasy.In “Gargoyles” we find several truly wonderful picture poems. Thus in “TheWhite Cat”: Hail, sweet my sister! hail, adulterous spouse, Gilded with passionate pomp, and gay with guilt: Rioting, rioting in the dreary house With blood and wine and roses splashed and spilt About thy dabbling feet, and aching jaws Whose tongue licks mine, twin asps like moons that curl, Red moons of blood! Whose catlike body claws, Like a white swan raping a jet-black girl, Mine, with hysteric laughter...* *Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 86."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"And the following four verses in “Saida” are superb: The spears of the night at her onset Are lords of the day for a while, The magical green of the sunset, The magical blue of the Nile.

We have swooned through the midday exhausted By the lips – they are whips – of the sun, The horizon befogged and befrosted By the haze and the grays and the dun Of the whirlings of sand Let loose on the land By the wind that is born of the sun. . . . . . . . . . . . . .Thrilled through to the marrow with heat We abode (as we glode) on the river.

As the aristocratic virtues of one century become the democratic vices of thenext, so do the noble renderings of one age of literature become thehackneyed phraseology of the following, this being true whether we arespeaking of poetry or prose. Vet one attribute alone remains ever youthful asthe ages roll by into the aeons, and that is— Ecstasy; whether we find it inthe rapture of Love, the melody of Song, or the fire of Deity, it is what Poemeant by “elevating excitement,” and as we have seen, it was because of itsabsence that he attacked the Epic school of verse. Ecstasy lies beyond our gnosis; as we shall hereafter see, it carries us out ofourselves, beyond the mere shell of existence, into the very depths of theprofound. For the fraction of a second the whole ocean of our being iswhirled through a narrow gorge, then once again we are hurled forth into theeddying cataracts of life, an essential spirit light gilding once again thesepulchral abode of a corpse. For a moment we behold God, face to face, butfor a moment only, then all again is night. Keats attained, and so did Shelleyand Browning. Read the last verses of the “Prometheus Unbound” and “AGrammarian’s Funeral,” and all will be plain; and it is this same ecstasy thatburns white in these two superb poems, which flames a bright star of beautyguiding us on our long journey across the hundred thousand leagues of theempire of Crowley’s pen. We find it shining brightly over almost everypage, a fact which renders the task of quoting nigh endless. Already we havecited a dozen or more examples. Volume I flames like a subtly gemmed ringwith the ecstasy of many moments, and many of the following citations inthis essay will be both brilliant and flashing; and as are the sides of theHeptagonal Vault, so also will be the contents of these seven chapters.

Lavishly scattered, we find it throughout theworks before us; in “Aceldama,” “Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic,” “TheTemple of the Holy Ghost,” “Tannhäuser,” “Rosa Mundi,” and “Alice.”Ecstasy is the keynote here, as it is of all poetry, all literature – aye! of allLife.

Histhoughts are as subtle, his imagination as gorgeous, his melodies ascharming as those of Shelley himself; soft as a summer breeze, fresh as thedawn in May, sunny as a June day, and then furious with burning passionand vitriolic lust. So closely interwoven in spirit are the true lyrics with theremainder of his amatory poetry, that it would be dangerous to attempt toseparate them, and such an attempt would almost certainly lead to repetitionor a breaking of the chain of psychosexual sensations, dimming that lustrewhich thrills through these magnificent verses, from the chaste kiss of amother to the Phaedrian embrace of a Sadistic sow.In “Why Jesus Wept,” we have the ephemeral and headstrong passion ofyouth; whilst in “The Tale of Archais” we find it burning only as a pure andlambent flame, overcoming all adversity, sacrificing self-love and even self-honour to attain the ideal of its purpose.Love is the predominant power in the universe; over and over again we shallfind this enforced, greater than fame, than wealth, than glory, greater thanknowledge, greater than wisdom, greater than the power of the Godsthemselves; for they too must worship at the shrine of Love, the shrine of thegreat World Mother, the mystic Isis, goddess of beauty, mother of love,queen of laughter, mistress of pleasure. “I am all that has been, that shall be,and none among mortals has hitherto taken off my veil.”**Inscribed on the statue of the Goddess.Innocent friendship or platonic love can never be a success where the raptureof a kiss is burning on the lips of two lovers; the first spells ignorance andthe second failure, for love will out, and if not as a limpid and sparklingstream, then as a turbid and roaring torrent, reckless and horrible.

The first effusion of puberty is described inthe-following three lines:...what shall slake This terrible thirst,This torment accurst?**Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 28.This, as is usually the case, finds an outlet in the first pretty maid whohappens to cross youth’s burning path, and in this case the fair damozel isMolly Tyson, and the first scene of their meeting is most typical:Sir Percy. Ah, love, love, how I love you. This is the world! Love!Love! I love you so, my darling. Oh my white golden heart of glory!**Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 30.Eternity is moulded in form of her kiss, and even if “Hell belch its monstersone by: one to stop the way! I would be there” cries Sir Percy as he andMolly rush backwards and forwards kissing and kissing before they canfinally part. And no sooner has he parted with her, having sworn eternal loveand to meet her at moonrise, than he stumbles across a bedizened hag ofsixty-three (society), and in ten minutes, because she calls herself “thewretchedest girl on the wide earth,” discovers “she is most beautiful”; “Howshe speaks! It is indeed an angel singing,” and asks if he may call herAngela, and forgets his poor village girl, and utterly overcome when shesays, (“I am a poor and simple girl, and my eyes are aching with the sight of"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"you, and my lips are mad to kiss you!”) falls into her arms learning his firstgreat lesson; for as Angela says, “it is dangerous, as well as cruel to leave alover standing.”To wake again to all the effervesence of efflorescent youth:Awake! awake!There is a secret in our subtle union That masters the grey snake.Awake, O Love! and let me drink my fill Of thee – and thou of me!**Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 40.His subtle union, however, is soon about to vanish, for Angela in a day or sowill have just about had her fill:Angela. Die, then, and kiss me dead! Sir Percy. I die! I die!Angela. Thy flower-life is shedInto eternity,A waveless lake.**Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 41.He sleeps, and she awake becomes somewhat weary of these “jejuneplatitudes,” these “ululations of preposterous puberty,” these very“eructations of gingerbread” and “flatulence of calf-sickness.”* Soon he iskicked flying out of her ladyship’s bed, and here we must leave him for atime to meet him again and his first love Molly further on, though not underthe sunshine of youthful amorosis.*Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 41.A different phase and a much more pleasing one of the impulsiveness ofyouthful love is given us in that glowing story “The Tale of Archais.” Thereare many mysteries in this poem.

The beauty of theclinging love of childhood is tinged with a glowing desire, the pink desire ofthe bud bursts into the passionate crimson of the rose, and as in “Alice,”“The dove gave place a moment to the swine;” – and yet hardly so! the puredesire of man and woman in whatever state of life, the weaving of thegolden web of twain into one entity, is not lust, never was lust, never will belust.According to the conventional meaning of that word, lust expressessomething unhealthy, unclean; and the love Charicles bore Archais wascertainly not that. This love, to use a good old English word, was a “lusty”love, that is a healthy love, and not a lustful or perverted desire. The beautyof nature, the beauty of living, and above all the bright beauty of Archais;intoxicated him; before him whirled visions of loveliness, and as her eyesreflected the passion of his own, as they smiled back on him all the love hebore her, yielding, he caught her up as a flame would another, and the “ironrod of law” grew misty, for they were one, one in body, mind and soul;alone for that moment, sole inhabitants of this World – Infinite.

Cf. the Qabalistic Dogma of Pistorius: “Schemamisericordiam dicit, sed et judicium.” The Infinite Being when exercising his power uponthe finite must necessarily chastise to correct and not to avenge himself. The strength ofthe sin does not exceed that of the sinner, and if the punishment be greater than theoffence, he who inflicts it becomes executioner and is the real criminal, who is whollyinexcusable, and himself alone deserving of eternal punishment. Any being who istortured above measure, enlarged by an infinitude of suffering, would become God, andthis is what the ancients represented in the myth of Prometheus, immortalized by thedevouring vulture, and destined to dethrone Jupiter. —The Mysteries of Magic, p. 120.Such is the power of Love, undaunted, infuriated in the cause of Freedom,Justice, and Truth. Charicles plunges into the waves of destiny, “And withhis strenuous hands the emerald water gripped.” Onward he swims strivingagainst Poseidon, god of the ocean, who heaps the sea foam against him, ashe makes for the Paphian isle to seek aid from the goddess of Love; and inhis blinding anger he sees her not, though she is by his side journeyinghomeward from Rome.

He was no SirPercy, flatulent with wind, who could not tell a harlot from a virgin; fallingat once a prey to a bedizened old prostitute of sixty-three.Those who should think the passion displayed in this tale as unbecoming andlustful, must indeed have minds composed of dung and cantharides,disappointed sterile old maids, or sated old matrons, pornophobics of theworst description. We know well the class, half Exeter Hall, half EmpireMusic-hall; “douée” (as a charming little French brochure describes one ofthis type), “du plus voluptueux tempérament courut longtemps lesaventures... mais ses ans et le grand usage altérèrent ses charmes, et elle pritle parti ordinaire, de donner à Dieu ce qu’elle ne pouvait plus offrir auxhommes, et pleura dans l’hypocrisie trente ans d’amour et de plaisir.” Weknow the type well, and so does Aleister Crowley; his Angela, before shefell into the boiling sulphuric acid, which was being prepared to remove herenamel, was president of a Zenana Mission.Love is, as must now be apparent, an all engrossing theme in the poetry ofAleister Crowley, every phase almost meeting with an illustration. We haveseen the flatulent love of youth, and its counterpart in the divine poeticsincerity of Charicles and Archais; we will now view it in its maturer form,and firstly, in the form of true and sincere love, unconventional and pure,whether under the bond of marriage, or under the boundless bond of freelove, between two souls of similar affinity.

Outside ourselves ethics do not exist, for they are the greatfaculty of sentient existence. The law of the survival of the fittest is notmoral, it is essential; but, manifested through reason it becomes ethical. Asregards the aspirations of the sexes, nature cares little whether John lovesAnn or Mary. Man, however, cares much. John is not married, Ann is;Nature implants a similar affinity in both, and they verge towards their ownmagnetic centre. Nature says “unite!” Man, however, thinks otherwise andso builds up a stout abatis out of the dead bones of unreasoning ages,fencing Ann in; and even if John does surmount this formidable obstacle, amoral fougasse awaits for his impetuous footstep, which will morally blowhim to smithereens. Again, John is unmarried, and Mary is in a similar stateof bliss, their affinities repel and do not attract: Nature says “keep apart!”;man says “I would rather see you unite with Mary than I would with Ann,affinities be damned!” They unite, and axiomatize the postulate of Hell.Nature now says “part!” man says “Oh! no you don’t.” Around them arethen speedily constructed such labyrinthine entanglements, that few findtheir way out, and still fewer attempt so difficult a task – hence Churchesand Brothels. If John, however, does not marry Mary, Ann squalls, but as thejailer can always let himself out of the prison, so can man, if he does notdrop his keys through some matrimonial grating. Ann then locks up Mary inthat Bastille of despair which is called Piccadilly (this is no paradox) – henceprudes and nymphs. Thus Nature is scouted and thumped on the nosebecause she is essential, and man is enthroned in her stead and smacked onthe back because he happens to be moral – hence Universities and Lunaticasylums.In Love, mankind eternally verges between folly and knavery, because manis a non-essential being, and Nature an un-moral power.But before we enter on the above idea as demonstrated in the poems ofAleister Crowley, it will be necessary to elucidate matters, and first to enteron a brief description of the Essential and the Moral; showing that man asusual has got hold of “the muddy end of the stick”; that the majority of thehuman species live in a state of purulent hypocrisy and mental indolence,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"and that the minority should consider themselves exceptionally fortunate ifthey save their souls from incarceration in the bolgia of conventionalrespectability.Aleister Crowley’s gospel of Love is the gospel of Freedom. As love is oneof those particular qualities that cannot possibly thrive under the perceptionof restraint, so can it only bloom in perfect freedom, whether legalized ornot; all other forms are Lust.Nature is the All-perfect, she is existence taken as a totality, and everythingbeing a part of her, consequently is subject to her government. Theinorganic, and what we choose to call the organic, are her two greatestmanifestations. Some consider these two as definitely separate; ethers thatthe organic is but a higher form of the inorganic; and others again that bothare illusions, and that Reality, as we suppose it materially to be, does notexist outside our own minds. We do not intend to enter here the illusivepaths of Idealism; but we might add, from a strictly logical point of view,that the latter system has much to support it. In all and every one of us lies acertain individual desire, which is strictly subjective, in the individual it iscalled character, in the nation government. The laws of a country are thecompilation of a series of individual characterizations, a series of innerreflections of the outer object. In each one of us there is a slight difference ofeffect, and this variation results in the survival of the fittest intellect. Nowthe essential difference between the spirit of an individual and that of anation is this: the first acts intuitively, the second mechanically; the formerpropels the latter, whilst the latter reacts as a drag on the former. If theformer is in a healthy state so will the latter be; if the latter becomes corruptit will then react and contaminate the former. This is the law of all Form –i.e., Government – and Reform.The outlaw of to-day was the citizen of yesterday, so the law of to-day willbecome the crime of tomorrow.Man being inherently lazy, and hence conservative, this power is foreverreacting on him, and binding him down to a government unsuited to histimes, and it is this power that he has chosen to call – the Moral code;notwithstanding the fact that it is not based in any way on the perceptions hehas obtained from Nature’s code as it now is reflected, but on that reflectionwhich was obtained by his ancestors, a far less worthy appreciation. And inthis inherent conservativeness and horror of change lie most of the tragedies"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"of love; for man trying to quench the natural flame of his desires in a torrentof chilly and criminal atavism, merely floods the virtuous path, leaving theby-ways of vice high and dry, inviting, crying to the sated wanderer.Man lives by paradoxes and contraries; martyrs and tortures himself,building around him lofty restrictions bristling with moral frises, and brokenethical beer-bottles, digging deep trenches around his joys, and then fillingthem with the tears of exasperation at his lot. All is either monopoly, orslavery, or taboo. Free in his actions he conceived law and solicitors; free inhis aspirations, religion and priests; free in his affections, marriage andwives. Inwardly he agrees that marriage is a success only when it comprisesa total unison of mind, body and soul, of sympathies and passions;outwardly that it is a perpetual seal, sealed by God. Dr. Maudsley once said,“No one can escape the tyranny of his organization,” but woe to the manwho cannot dissemble that he can! Marriage, the hackneyed sexual union, isa lie to love, a legalizing of prostitution, an abortive horror, over whichbroods the grinning form of the Jew-God – God of lechers and harlots, ofDavid and Rahab. What sight more truly pitiable than to behold the tenderheart of some young girl, or the ardent spirit of another, cramped by thisunnatural bond, and denied the joys of a beneficent Nature, that yearning tolove and be loved. But not with impunity do we thus triumph over ournatures; love cannot be so rudely suppressed; the primary want of our beingmust inevitably conquer. Looking back on history we find few parallels tothe general lust of the present day. Two thousand years of the Cross have to-day left as token of its morality 80,000 prostitutes on the London streetsalone.* “Can that have been human?” I see you point through the drizzlingnight to a cramped and shivering form. Can that have been a woman? Thatliving death, degraded by crime, brutalized by vice, vitiated, unsouled; lowerthan a slave, worse than a dog; spurned by man, shunned by woman, ahuman wreck, a growing horror? Even so, once a smiling girl, sweet as arose, pure as a lily; now the bedraggled gin-sodden harridan. O! marriage,thy name is Failure: O! priest, what hast thou done? Cramped the humanmind, betrayed thy trust, sacrificed love on the altar of Mammon, leaving theheart as a blighted flower, the soul as a hollow shell, void, execrable.*In 1861 Henry Mayhew stated that the assumed number of prostitutes in London wasabout 80,000. And further adds— “large as this total may appear, it is not improbable thatit is below the reality than above it. One thing is certain – if it be an exaggeratedstatement – that the real number is swollen every succeeding year, for prostitution is aninevitable attendant upon extended civilization and increased population.” —LondonLabour and London Poor, p. 213."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Even love is sold, the solace of all woe Is turned to deadliest agony, old ageShivers in selfish beauty’s loathing armsAnd youth’s corrupted impulses prepare A life of horror from the blighting baneOf commerce; whilst the pestilence that springs From unenjoying sensualism, has filledAll human life with hydra-headed woes.So sang Shelley. Now let us turn to Aleister Crowley, and we shall find hisideal no less great, noble and true than that of Shelley’s, the divinest of thepoets and pioneers of Truth, Freedom, and Beauty.Love is the finding in others what others cannot find in them, and it is of twodegrees. The love of a mother towards her child; and the love of man andwoman towards woman and man. The first is generally considered to bepurer and more ideal, but this idea has only grown out of man’s entireignorance regarding the physical relationships. The mother is in no waypurer than the wife, neither is the virgin purer than the mother. The truestdefinition of chastity is that as given by Benjamin Franklin, which defineschastity as “the regulated and strictly temperate satisfaction without injury toothers, of those desires which are natural to all healthy adult beings.”* Thereason for this idea of uncleanliness though certainly obscure is traceablemore particularly to the utter mystery man saw in this supreme function, andalso, that all hygienic laws being unknown to him, any disease resultingfrom the act was attributed indirectly to the woman – instead of to his ownwant of knowledge – and directly to the supernatural manifesting its wraththrough her as a medium; for the supernatural to primitive man’sunderstanding invariably took the shape of malevolent and not benevolentpowers. This and the periodic functions of the woman, as well as, asWestermarck says, “the instinctive feeling against intercourse betweenmembers of the same family or household,” developed the conception ofuncleanliness in. an act which has been rightly stated by Geoffrey Mortimeras being “the eternal symbol of love and life, and the purest of human joys,”and which act being attributed to supernatural powers came under theauthority of religion, and fell into the hands of an interested priesthood,giving them an immense power over women, and through women over men;an influence that has been exercised in every land, and every age, by thesespiritual leaders: an influence by which they have in so many cases ruled the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"minds of men, and by which for so many centuries they have blighted thehappiest prospects of many a human heart. But surely now that we havereached the twentieth century, thousands and thousands of years since theseprimitive times, should we not shake off these trammels of infant thought,and, assuming our manhood, decry an ideal that is not only brutal butabsurd; instead of reverencing it because of its great antiquity, or because ofour conservative sympathies with the past days of our fathers. Woman is asclean as man, and a wife married or unmarried as pure as any virgin.Generation is no more filthy than alimentation; both are necessary, both areaccompanied by natural appetites; the one maintains the individual, the otherthe race; both may be carried to extremes, both may become lusts.*A disciple of Pythagoras once asked him, when was it permitted him to cohabit with hiswife? To which that philosopher replied: “When you are tired of resting.” Théano, wifeof Pythagoras, was also once asked: “How long does it take for a woman to be purifiedwho has known a man?” To which she answered: “If it is with her husband, she ispurified by the act, if with another she is for ever defiled.” For it is not marriage whichsanctifies love, but love which justifies marriage. —EDOUARD SCHURÉThe world is ever progressing onward, and we must progress with it, or elsestagnation and retrogression will set in; and in these competitive times thelatter two spell social and moral death. What was good yesterday may bebad to-day, and what is good to-day may be evil to-morrow. What theultimate end will be, none can tell, for it lies “behind the veil”; but what wemust do is very certain, very definite, very sure. We must ameliorate our lot,not by the ephemeral laws of the dead, but through the needs and wants ofthe living, on the solid foundation of the truest possible morality, based onNature, and manifested to us through our divine powers of reason. Andmuch of this new morality do we find in the love-gospel of AleisterCrowley.First turning to the love incarnate in motherhood, we find a touching case inthe picture of Cora in “The Mother’s Tragedy.” Cora Vavasour, late of thehalls, yet as true and noble a woman as ever lived, a type of woman that,thank Heaven, is not so uncommon among those whom the prudes call fallenclasses. Cora was scarcely, however, one of these; living in luxury she triedto bury the recurring past, “Old hours of horror,” and she trusted that “Godhath made smooth the road beneath the hearse” of her “forgetful age.”Let me not shrink!

To adulterate is to debase; but there is nodebasement here. Love burns pure as a flame, and if it is, as it is here,between a married woman and a lover who is not her legal husband, so muchdeeper the lesson, so much vaster the love; defying all for its own sake: andhere, as we shall see in the end, sacrifices itself, so as not to tarnish thenames of innocent children, which the old harridan Society would otherwisehave besmirched with her foul saliva. In “Messaline” we however have, asthe poet says “leprous entanglements of sense”; here is a magnificentpassage heated with passion and not a little lust:Breast to great breast and thigh to thigh, We look, and strain, and laugh, and die. I see the head hovering aboveTo swoop for cruelty or love;I feel the swollen veins belowThe knotted throat, the ebb and flow Of blood, not milk, in breasts of fire; Of deaths, not fluctuants, of desire;Of molten lava that abidesDeep in the vast volcanic sides;Deep scars where kisses once bit in Below young mountains that be twin, Stigmata cruciform of sin,The diary of Messaline.**1.

The lesson that Love is onlyworthy its hallowed name, when free; that it is only worth having whenfreely given, and worth keeping when freely held, without bond or writ.

If wives were a success, man wouldnot want to go neighing after other women; if food were not so expensive,women would not sell their bodies for offal. Vaughan says to him, pointingto a prostitute, “Do you find beauty in her?” to which Percy answers: “No,but I see in her history a poem, to which I trust that God will write an end!”*And so the God, who is eternal Love at present does – in the Lock Hospitalor over Waterloo Bridge. Nevertheless there is a great truth hidden in thisline. The truth that love shall triumph over mind, or rather that both shallagree. If the carnal act is foul, it is then as foul in the palace as in the brothel:mere prostitution of the body need not necessarily mean a similarprostitution of the mind, as we saw in the “Tale of Archais.” Every woman’sbody is as free a possession of her own as that of every man is of his own,and what is disgraceful to woman is equally disgraceful to man, and viceversâ.

The laws of theVedas, of Manu, of Buddha, the codes of Confucius and Lao-Tze, theTalmudic books of the Jews, and the Koran of the Mohamedans, all maintainits direct influence and restrictions; and in the West in the old mythologiesof Teuton and Celt, in the old Norse sagas, more so in the Roman andGrecian law, and still more so on the Christian edicts of Constantine,Theodoric, Athalaric, and Justinian, and the innumerable codes of theMiddle Ages: all of which growing one into the other have produced thattruly revolting state of affairs belting the world with Lust. As every one of ushas been bred on dead flesh, so every one of us passes along our wayspiritually encumbered with the dead bones of our ancestors’ opinions; andliving with them we die, only to add more mental tibias and spiritualmetatarsals to the groaning back of the future.In the Kingdom of Love these extremes gave birth to two forces, “NeronicLust” and “Platonic Affection.” From a heterogeneous mass of ics, ists, andians, sprang the idea that there was an inherent evil in the culmination of thenuptial state; and out of it grew the preying vampirism of Paul. ‘Thisinherent evil supposed to lie latent in matter, as opposed to the bliss of spirit,Crowley sets forth very forcibly in several of his poems. In “The Growth ofGod” we have most of the argument in the following lines:The Shapeless, racked with agony, that grewInto these phantom forms that change and shatter;The falling of the first toad-spotted dew;The first lewd heaving ecstasy of matter.**The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 178.The idea grows still more powerfully in the next verse:I see all Nature claw and tear and bite,All hateful love and hideous: and the broodMisshapen, misbegotten out of spite;"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Lust after death; love in decrepitude.Thus, till the monster-birth of serpent-manLinked in corruption with the serpent-woman,Slavering in lust and pain – creation’s ban.The horrible beginning of the human.**The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 198.

But besides You ask hot snow and leaden feather-flights!**Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 237.Which contains a great truth, namely, that platonic love is no love at all. Anaffection it may be, but love it cannot be if it dare not see its form mirroredin the eyes of a loving woman. Its failure in the end is a certainty; certainascetics may compel their wills to conquer their natures, but men as a wholecannot. Certain maniacs such as Origen may emasculate themselves for theKingdom of God, but the great human masses will let the Kingdom of Godgo to the Devil, if a pretty pair of lips is in question. Not for long in any casecan we change our natures, as the anchorites of the Libyan deserts only toofearfully proved; boiling with carnalities they feared to see their ownmothers, and were even forbidden to keep in their possession animals of thefemale sex – O Stylites! they are now in heaven!How we clave together!

In the former,questing for the ideal of his hopes, man falls tangled into the arms of thereal; in the latter, entangled, he strives to tear away the meshes of hispassion, and at length succeeds in releasing himself from the magic threads.In “The Nameless Quest,” Gereth is in love with the Queen, and the Kingcalls on a knight to go on the Nameless Quest to a certain pillar which lies atthe end of the road which leads from Human desire to Divine contentment;around it lie the bones of the “questing slain” unburied, unremembered,unconfessed; Gereth’s name is cried aloud, and the King bids him God-speed, girding on him his own true sword, whilst the Queen draws from herfinger a ring and places it on his.

A manwho truly loves a woman loves her so intensely that all else is as naught; shegrows before him gigantic through the mist of his desire, swallowing him upin the affinity of her being. The King’s sword was of little use; the pillar ofthe Higher Self lay in the salt-encrusted plains, saline with the tears and sobsof failure; the ring emblematic of surrender, without beginning or end, wasemblematic also of the eternality of love, that circling girdle of the world.In “Tannhäuser” we have a similar idea, though reversed; for Tannhäuserenmeshed in the web of the Venusberg, strives against the sensual to gain aspiritual victory; whilst in “The Nameless Quest” the knight, fearful offalling in the sensual slough, seeks, and loses his straight way in the spiritualdesert. Thus, as in the latter case, the striving against the desire of a purelove leads to an almost certain failure, so in the former, when sunk deep inthe mud of an impure affection, even if released from its circling arms,worldly mercy is as cold to him who has plunged through the Cytherean seaas a winter in Gaul.

The path of Vice we must tread before we can find the high road ofVirtue, and Vice we must wed before we can open the gates of a moreperfect understanding. The great Commandment is: “Live in the midst ofVice; but heed that Vice doth not live in thy midst.”**Vide Hosea.“God is the Complex and the Protoplast.” And so are we; entwined withinus, as in the poem of Tannhäuser, lie the countless threads of inheritedtendencies. To suspend our soul on one alone leads only to utter destruction;to climb to heaven we must grasp the whole tangled skein of our experiencesand mount from Malkuth to Kether through the gates of Knowledge,Wisdom, and Understanding.

Regardless of manners, man sucks the wretched littlebone as he would the leg of a chicken, tears off the flesh and casts it into thebin. The masses are but sheep, following the bell-wether convention; deprivethem of their initial, and they become neither lambs nor tigers but merelyasses.

Again, in others so subtle is thepsychology of sense that this hysterical clinging to the Chaste often reacts,hurling its unfortunate aspirant into the arms of Lubentina. The lust afterGod and the lust after man are near akin. A woman crossed in love anddebarred from enjoying the sweet embraces of her lover, will embrace in hisstead the sour feet of her God. Similarly, Magdalene, having passionatelysought love, and having lost the skein of her desires in the labyrinthinebyways of lust, threw her weeping form at the feet of Him in whom shefound the ideal of her affection, washing those dusty feet with her tears, anddrying them with the long tresses of her hair, still perfumed with the kissesof a thousand lovers. Jesus Christ and John Smith are very nearly related,and a woman who is capable of loving one is also capable of loving theother. Flaubert finely pictures this when he represents Madame Bovary,kneeling at her prie-dieu and addressing to her Lord the same sweet wordsshe had formerly murmured to her lover in the effusions of adultery. So itoften happens that the most spiritual are at heart the most passionate. Passionand Religion are the divine Dioscuri, children of Nemesis.Man, when God became too intangible, too magnificent to approach,conceived a mediator.

Such is the dualityof love – the mundane and the celestial.Which nations now are the most passionate, the man-worshippers or thewoman-worshippers? the latter, and it is for this reason that I includedTannhäuser in the first part of this essay, rather than in the second, dealingwith the philosophy of Aleister Crowley. It is this spiritual exaltation,curious as it may seem, which so often links the pure true love to the foulfalse love. Love of man and woman is normal, love of man and woman forGod is abnormal, and the abnormal in its turn breeds the lustful, whether theabnormality lies in the twists of the mind or the aberrations of the soul.Amnon lusted after Tamar, he was a mental monster; Ezekiel devoureddung, he was a spiritual abortion.That a passionate nature is necessarily a lustful one, is often no more thecase than that a lustful one need necessarily be passionate; that lust as wellas passion often inhabit the same mind is true enough, and that its forms aremonstrous must be apparent to all students of sexual psychology; as thecold-blooded lust of the lecher, who can only find stimulation for his grosslecheries in the horrors of a de Sade, devouring in security and ease maidensand youths, as the minotaur did of old – “semibovemque virum,semivirumque bovem.” This is the lust which is the most horrid, and themost damnable; it takes much to produce a passionate man, but little toengender a lustful one. The present generation possesses a minimum ofpassion and a maximum of lust. There is no lust of Rome, of Greece, orArabia, no vice of Sodom, of Paphos, or Lampsacus, that is not practised to-day in any of our larger modern towns. Lust of wealth, lust of ease, lust orrenown, lie as cankering worms in our hearts; and the cold bought lust of ourmarriage-beds and our streets fill our days with woe. Chivalry is dead, andthe gilded Ass reigns in the place of the champing Stallion, and brays itsgoatish desires over the naked form of the sterile Mule.No longer in this ice-bound age of frozen phalli do we hear sung:For, swooning at the fervid lipsOf Artemis, the maiden kissesSob, and the languid body slipsDown to enamelled wildernesses."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Fallen and loose the shaken tresses;Fallen the sandal and girdling gold, Fallen the music manifoldOf moving limbs and strange caresses, And deadly passion that possessesThe magic ecstasy of theseMad maidens, tender as blue seas.**The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i. p. 170.For this is passion, if not quite so pure as some we have already seen, yetstill passion of an unlustful nature.

His religion, his philosophy, and his psychology,all point to an ultimate blending of our extreme perfections andimperfections – vice and virtue – in one great monistic unity. He that wouldbe wise must know all things, all things that his transient life can enable himto grasp. In the age which produced Rabelais and Boccaccio, vice wasflagrantly open, and the lust which the early Christians had first opposed andsecondly absorbed, slowly burnt within the society of their days, till it burstout in the lecherous flames of a libidinous papacy. Many witty andlascivious books, which in those times were openly enjoyed, have beenhanded down to us. In the north the puritanic upheaval, still so felt, set in;and in its first stages it probably was strictly anti-vicious, but in its secondmerely a screen to hide vice from the public gaze. This, in its turn, led to thegood feeling a disgust for the bad, which in our age has developed into aninborn shame which condemns open vice, but tolerates, even endows it,when hidden. Open vice, unscreened and esotericised by religion, wouldhave in the sequence of events led to an open feeling of disgust, for Naturenever permits man to borrow without paying back, the general settlementday will always sooner or later arrive, and then a new epoch of time will beheralded in. Secret vice is the very worst form of vice; like a hidden gin wefall betwixt its jaws unawares. The crass and studied silence that mothersand fathers maintain over their children as regards all subjects of sex isprobably responsible for fifty percent: and more of all the sexual crimes andsexual ills of the present day. When mankind has grasped the fact that itsorgans of reproduction are no more disgusting than its organs of respiration,it will then have grasped a greater truth than all philosophies have everpromulgated, than all religions have ever revealed. “And they were bothnaked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed”: THIS IS VIRTUE.“And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they werenaked”: THIS IS VICE."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Know Thyself, Be Thyself, Honour Thyself, are the three greatestcommandments we can follow.

And as religion could notpossibly restrain her octopus tentacles of cupidity from the game of grab, shealso hisses, “Pray to God and he will tie a knot in his bandana and perhapsremember it some day; but above all, sacrifice to me, or by Jove!

Hegel held: “that a thing can only arise through itsopposite,” and this idea was also held by the Qabalists. Deity created goodand evil; and both are absolutely necessary to the existence of each other.Further, the Qabalist does not even recognize their independence as twoopposing powers, but as one under the one Supreme Deity; the externalvisible matter world of evil and darkness, and the internal spiritual higherworld of Goodness and Light, beneficent and malevolent as the ancient godsof Babylonia.

Hermes struck a higher chord when hesaid: “To create God, is to accomplish our own creation, to make ourselvesindependent, impassible, and immortal.” Blake demonstrated the at-onenessof Good and Evil very clearly in “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.” “I tellyou no virtue can exist without breaking these ten commandments,” he says,referring to the Decalogue. Further back in his “Proverbs of Hell,” he writes:You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.The pride of the peacock is the glory of God.The lust of the goat is the bounty of God.The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God.The nakedness of woman is the work of God.For everything that lives is Holy.In Samuel Butler’s “Erewhon” we find much the same idea in the followingcouplet."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"He who sins aught sins more than he ought, But he who sins naught, has much to be taught.Blake further writes in “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell”:A man carried a monkey about for a show, and because he wasa little wiser than the monkey, grew vain, and conceived himself asmuch wiser than seven men.

TheArcanum of Solomon is represented by the two pillars of the temple,Yakheen and Boaz, the two forces, the white and the black; separate andcontrary, yet in their polarity they are uniform, equilibrating their unity. Thephilosopher’s stone, as Hermes declared, consisted in separating the etherealfrom that which was gross.Thou shalt separate the earth from the fire, the ethereal from thegross, gently, but with great industry. It ascends from earth to heaven, and again it comes down fromheaven to earth, and it is invested with the potency of superior andinferior things. Thou wilt possess by this means the glory of the whole world,and all darkness will depart from thee. It is the strong power of every power, for it will overcome allthings subtle and penetrate all things solid. It is thus that the world was created.**Hermes.Tannhäuser also separated the higher from the lower self, the good from theevil. Christ also attempted the same course, not living alone for either goodor bad, but for the whole, as Jeláládeen sang, “I am the song and singer,”etc., the surest centre of immortality lying in the whole, and not in the part.The Qabalist compared the wicked with the excrement of the great humanbody, a necessary vivific secretion, and not a poison to the living organism.Waite tells us: “These excretions also serve as a manure to the earth, whichbrings forth fruits to nourish the body; thus death reverts always to life, andevil itself serves for the renewal and nourishment of good.”*1.

Many are the tracks and by-paths oflife which lead over the mountains, the swamps, the forests of existence tothat great road, the road of the Soul.From the supernal flights of Idealism, we now find Crowley in the mostinfernal depths of realism striving through a sea of blood towards thatflaming pentacle which flares on the dim horizon of Hope. All is night, yetall is expectation; herculean is the task, yet the heart is that of a Titan. Blakesaw that “Prisons are built with stones of Law; brothels with bricks ofReligion,” and so does Crowley. Both in their sagacity perceive that the onegreat crime is that of exclusiveness. The Christian failing to see this,worshipped the masculine power of wisdom and neglected the femininepower of Intelligence, his God was as the God of most religions a veritableHe-God, therein lay his fault; the only philosophy perhaps that grasped thetruth was that of the Qabala. The microprosopus was neither masculine norfeminine, but androgynous; and it was left for William Postel to utter one ofthe greatest world truths when he said, “The Word has indeed become man,but not until the Word has become woman will the world be saved.” It is thisthat Crowley sets vividly out before us in his following ethical philosophy.“To behold sin in its naked Deformity, is the most certain method to obligeus to love Virtue,” such is to be read in the prefatory note of a curious littlevolume to be found in the British Museum library under the attractive title of“The prostitution of Quality or Adultery à-la-mode.” It was through theGarter that in the end the Star was seen, in other words it was through theintimate knowledge of the lewd, bad and vicious, that the tender weepingheart was discovered; the rough matrix contained a gem of surpassingbeauty, the horny shell a pearl of perfect loveliness. Charicles had to treadthe thorny path before he won his Archais, and so must we, before we canwin knowledge, weep many bitter tears.

The former isontologic, the latter empiric: the first descends from fiction, whilst thesecond rises from fact; both, paradoxical as it may seem, are at one and thesame time contradictory and identical, merging into a perfect unity, not inthe realms of a spiritual or material monism, but in those of a Hylo-Idealisticphilosophy, which is Agnostic, and from thence into a Self-Illuminismwhich baffles definition.*1. Argument: This chapter attempts to show how all philosophies may be equated incorresponding terms of each other; and how the philosophic principles of Berkeley andHume, combined, form what may be known as the philosophical theme of Crowleyanity,in which it is demonstrated how all systems are inwardly mystically identical, andoutwardly sceptically diverse. Further, how by the study of Berkeley, Hume, and Kant,taken unitedly or separately, the conclusion which is arrived at is, that the Reason alone isinadequate to solve the Great Problem; for ultimately all systems based on a Rationalfoundation arrive at an inscrutable mystery – ”God,” “A Something,” “An à priori,”beyond which they cannot penetrate. Where Agnosticism and Scientific Buddhism end,Crowleyanity begins. By Qabalistically tackling the question, it proposes a Future to allRational Philosophies, thereby becoming a mystical theurgy, whereby the difficulties setin motion by the conceptions of “Infinite” and ”Eternal” are overcome by the annihilationof Time and Space, and the reduction of all rational terms to an absolute inertia in zero.From here Crowleyanity becoming purely mystical becomes symbolic, leading those whofollow into the Kingdom of the Adepts; and finally showing how the keynote of allmystical systems of either East or West, is to be found in Ecstasy; and how the former,arriving at this sublime state by purely mechanical methods, are not so suitable to thoseWestern nations as their own poetic mysticism, as found in the divine works of theChristian Fathers, the Alchymistic Philosophers, and the Mystical Poets of Ancient andModern times.*2. There is an old saying, “All men are born either Platonists or Aristotelians.”For many centuries now, European thought has been labouring under thedamnosa hereditas of foregone conclusions. And as religion in the attemptto anthropomorphise power, through the medium of dialectic symbols, lostall footing and plunged headlong into the pandemoniac majesty of Deity, sophilosophy, losing all grip of reality by clutching the illusive realism of itsown creative faculties, was itself whirled into that furnace of hereditary"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"prejudice, and educational bias, from out of which it has flowed a mass ofmolten and subservient acquiescence.

Before the name of That which is beyond lifeand death, beyond matter and energy, beyond the human and the mortal; hestands, holding before us as a standard, the homologue of the Labarum ofold, “In hoc signo vinces... Non timendum est Veritate duce.”In order to cut a long story short, it may be assumed that so-called modernphilosophy finds its founder in the French philosopher Descartes; for it washe who started to unravel the Penelope web of tangled philosophic thought,which had lain sleeping for a thousand years or more upon the sterile shelfof Christian impotence.His theories of “Innate ideas” raised the anger of Locke, the disciple ofAristotle and Bacon. Revolting from the cognito ergo sum of Descartes, hecompared the mind to a tabula rasa, on which he in his turn wrote an equalabsurdity in the words: nihil est in intellectu quod non antea fuerit in sensu.Leibnitz in his day, perceiving the weakness in this axiom, extended itsphraseology, but in no way its meaning, by adding Excipi nisi ipseintellectus. This weakness in Locke’s system became only too apparent tohis followers; and Berkeley, as well as Hume, and later still Kant himself,travelling by slightly different roads, ultimately arrived at the samedestination: “we cannot go beyond experience.”In the first half of the last century Kant’s immediate successors, such asFichte, Schelling and Hegel, swinging round this central point of attraction,though viewing it from different positions, ultimately, like moths round acandle, fell spluttering into the socket, burnt by that same flame they wereattempting to explain away.

And it is on account of the want of this ”I“ that all scienceresting on the inquiry “What do I know?” without the “I” being analyticallydisclosed, must, and does, rest upon knowledge purely accidental orhypothetical.*Huxley’s Essay on Hume, p. 59.It is quite as possible for hypothetical arguments to be rightly and wronglyapplied, as it is for mechanical tools. A pick-axe is a most useful implementin levelling a road, and equally a most useless one in mending a watch; soalso with hypothetical arguments, a subtle and illuminated mystic willdiscard such mean scaffolding, or at least attain such a perfection in the artof constructing his temple of the Holy Ghost as in time to be able to dowithout such mental timber. Such scaffold poles are those which support andbuttress up the frail edifice of science on the mud of ignorance, in which itand its superstructure will eventually be engulfed; for its whole foundationreposes upon the unequilibrated illusions of the mind, which so long as theirinfluences remain unbalanced, stand as impediments in the way of theinward development of the human race.* And as the gigantic edifice of theChristian Church was the child of the neuropathic mystagogues of the darkages of religion, so now the colossal fabric of Scientific Utilitarianism,offspring of a distorted and epileptic steam-mania, has bemerded us with itspanting slime, and wound us tight in the arachnoid meshes of itskakodemoniacal web, until we stand before ourselves, no longer homosapiens, but alone, naked and unadorned, a cinder-sprinkled, soot-besmeared, spider-legged, homo ridiculissimus!*Science here as a method is not attacked.

This system of thought, built on the illusive phantasmagoria of themind, found in the West a master-mind to mould it into shape, in thepersonality of Democritus of Abdera; and from the day when that sagematerialized the creations of his brain to that of Büchner and the present-daymud-larks, it has formed the stumbling-block to nearly every great thinker,and the veritable pus puriens of the common mind. However, out of theslough grew, as must always happen, a subtle plant; and in the form ofNewton, whose scientific demonstration of auto-kineticism, many agespreviously adumbrated by Empedocles and Democritus, gave the death-blowto that Empiricism, which may be typified in Locke’s assertion that ”motionand figure are really in the manna,” to which Berkeley attributed a purelymental existence; for he asserts again and again that the only substantialexistence is the hypothetical substratum of mind, i.e., spirit.* And this, asHuxley himself states, if pushed to its logical extreme, passes into pantheismpure and simple; and thus through objecting to Locke’s primary qualities asthings in themselves, Berkeley returns, through the objection, back to thecausa sui, or better, ratio sui of Spinoza, the spiritual twin of Locke.*All these philosophers end in the same quandary as the old gentleman who with onlyone tooth in his mouth tried to spike a pickled onion.I have taken some little trouble to arrive at this one isolated conclusion, thatthe Realism of the scholastic philosophers, the materialism of the classicaland modern sages, and also, if we choose to extend our scheme,Nominalism, Conceptualism, Theism, Positivism, Spiritualism(Malebranche), Agnosticism (Spencer), all and one, with all the other isms,may, with the slightest trouble in the world, be equated into correspondingterms of Berkeleyan Idealism. And why? Because each individual master,each separate school, like the astronomer in the fable, whilst gazing at hisown particular star, fell into the open ditch which yawned unperceived at hisfeet. And Berkeley: is he the Ultima Thule, the stone of the wise?

The question asked is:which is first, A or B? And the answer depends entirely upon the direction ofthought. Science will say that intelligence is last, and that matter slowlyevolves into animal life; in fact, that matter (A) is first, and intelligence (B)is second. The idealists and sankhyâs will put intelligence (B) first, and theseries will run B,A,B,A,B,A. Both, however, are indicating the same chain;but Crowley,* like the philosophers of the Vedanta, strides beyond bothintellect and matter to find an “I“ (purusha) or self, which is beyond allintellect, and of which intellect is but the borrowed light, as Patanjali says inone of his yoga aphorisms: “The seer is intelligence only, and though pure,sees through the colouring of the intellect.“*This is the earlier Fichtean Crowley, though he has already passed through Schelling toHegel, and grouped this triad in one, as it were Fichte in excelsis; not the middle, who hascalled the triad “Schelling”; still less the latter, who, perceiving the antinomies of reason,dismisses alike the data and conclusions of all the sciences with an all-embracingscepticism, while he devotes life to the perfecting of an instrument by whose aid we mayeventually be able to make a fresh start.In “Pentecost,” Crowley writes:You know for me the soul is noughtSave a new phantom in the thought,That thought itself impermanent,Save as a casual elementWith such another may combineTo form now water and now wine;The element itself may beChangeless to all eternity,But compounds ever fluctuateWith time or space or various state.(Ask chemists else!)

Formwas reality, and nothing else, it was the sole and only essence. From suchmetaphysics rose numerous modified forms which may he roughly classedunder the name of Spiritualism (Malebranche). They asserted that matterobjectively was illusion or maya, and that the world problem could only beconsidered as a reality subjectively in the thoughts as “thinks,” in fact theworld real was simply an elaboration of these ”thinks.” These spiritualisticphilosophies stagnating for a time were soon mystified by man’s inherentlonging for the wonderful,* and developed into various systems of Spiritismand Mysticism, both high and low. Of the latter the most renowned, and inmany ways the most profound, was the Philosophy of the Qabalah.*“The imagination of man is naturally sublime, delighted with whatever is remote andextraordinary, and running without control into the most distant parts of space and time inorder to avoid the objects, which custom has rendered too familiar to it.” —An Enquiryconcerning Human Understanding, Hume (Religion of Science Library), p. 172.The Qabalah, if it may be called a philosophy; for it was never synthetical,or concrete, being a conglomerated mass of ecstatic ideals and exalteddesires, evolved in the mind of man as an attempt to grasp all possiblequantities emanating from the Ain Soph, which in itself remained Zero.Turning now for a short time from the Mystic to the Idealistic philosophy,we find that though both are closely united, the former founds its system onman’s wondering ignorance in trying to link subject and object esoterically,whilst the latter builds up reality in mind perceptions, treating nothing asillusion but the reality of the materialists. Berkeley, when he declared in his"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"transcendental philosophy that esse=percipi was only in reality reiteratingthe idea held ages previously in “The Veil of Maya.” Kant threw more fuelon the Berkeleyan argument when he stated in his ”Critique of PureReason,” that we can have no positive knowledge whatsoever of “the thingin itself.” Since then this idea of the subjectivity of reality has gained moreground under Hegel, and later in numerous works dealing directly orindirectly with Spiritual Monisms. Even in the middle of the eighteenthcentury, forty years after Berkeley had stimulated the dry bones of thisproblem into a vigorous existence, materialism waged but a losing, or at bestan unprogressive war against it. Holbach himself had to admit that, thoughhe considered Berkeley’s arguments as sheer sophisms, they neverthelessremained unanswerable... Idealism may not be correct, neither may itsintenser form Spiritualism; but so far as this argument is of value, neithermay Realism nor Materialism; for both these philosophies have, as we havejust seen, resolved themselves into an infinite chain of events, which may beexpressed under the symbolization of A,B,A,B,A,B, the ultimate issue beingthe triumph of Agnosticism.All the wisest from all ages with all their wisdom finally have had to utter”We Know Not,” and write “ignoramus” across their life’s work.

To clearly illuminate theOrphic progress through the Plutonic regions of Philosophy, it will benecessary, first of all to satisfy the three heads of the terrible offspring ofEchidna’s womb, whose names are Berkeley, Hume, and Kant.BERKELEYBerkeley, that “God-illumined Adept,”*1. almost at the commencement ofhis introduction to “The Principles of Human Knowledge,” states: “Upon thewhole, I am inclined to think that the far greater part, if not all, of thosedifficulties which have hitherto amused philosophers, and blocked up theway to knowledge, are entirely owing to ourselves – that we have first raiseda dust, and then complained we cannot see.”*2. And naturally to expect,Berkeley himself, though an Adept of a very high order, starting upwardsthrough the clear atmosphere of the sky, clutched the very fire from the altarof God, and then in his descent to the dusty plains of Earth, caused such awhirlwind to arise, that his immediate successors, and even we who live twohundred years after that storm arose, scarce dare open our eyes for fear ofbeing blinded.*1. Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 225.*2. P. 6.A mystic by nature and a priest by profession, we must, in reviewing hisbequests to knowledge, always remember how much of the one side todeduct from the other, should we wish to prove him either an Adept or aBishop. But with such inborn predilection, and such outward assumption, itis easy to understand why it was that he threw the whole energy of his lifeinto an attempt to refute the advancing scepticism latent in the works ofHobbes and Locke. He saw, and seeing fought the many children which hadsprung from the fertile womb of the Cartesian doctrine, of abstract generalideas and secondary qualities; which alone found birth in the powers oflanguage, and in the delusion of words. But behind the didactic Berkeleystands the mystic, that other Berkeley, whose knowledge has alone beenattained by a very few; for he spoke with God face to face."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"“Could men but forbear to amuse themselves with words, we should, Ibelieve, soon come to an agreement in this point... that the absoluteexistence of unthinking things are words without a meaning, or whichinclude a contradiction.”**The Principles of Human Knowledge, p. 43.Berkeley, as has only too often been repeated and too frequentlymisunderstood, did not deny the meaning of substance as taken in the vulgarsense – a combination of sensible qualities, and though it may be possible,he stated, “that solid, figured, movable substances may exist without themind, corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies, yet how is it possiblefor us to know this? Either we must know it by sense or by reason... Butwhat reason can induce us to believe the existence of bodies without themind, from what we perceive.”*1. This point Crowley fully emphasizes in“Time” when he writes: “a thing is only real to us so far as it is known by us;even its Unknowability is a species of knowledge of it: and, by Savitri! whenI say real to us, I say real absolutely, since all things lie to me in the radiusof my sensorium. ‘To others’ is a vain phrase.”*2. And as it has already beenshown in the chain A,B,A,B,A,B, it matters not if the Materialist chooses toplace his finger on A, or the Idealist on B; so in the above, Berkeleyannihilating the idea of a material substratum, at one and the same moment,unwittingly immolates his own cherished child on that same blade withwhich he has just sacrificed his foe. And, seeking to supplant the miserablehuts of the materialist, Berkeley similarly builds his gorgeous palaces onreason, perceiving not that the foundations of both are the same, and that onelike the other will crumble into dust before the blinding storm of dialecticdispute.*1. The Principles of Human Knowledge, p. 39. *2. Time, vol. ii, p. 269.Berkeley, in positing Esse=percipi, considered that he once and for all hadoverthrown scepticism, which he defined as – the disbelief of the senses.*1.In “The Principles of Human Knowledge,” he states: “Our knowledge ofthese (ideas) hath been very much obscured and confounded, and we havebeen led into very dangerous errors, by supposing a twofold existence of theobjects of sense – the one intelligible or in the mind, the other real andwithout the mind; whereby unthinking*2. things are thought to have a"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"natural subsistence of their own distinct from being perceived by spirits.This... is the very root of Scepticism... For how can it be known that thethings which are perceived are conformable to those which are notperceived, or exist without the mind.”*3. Shortly before arriving at thisconclusion, he had already stated that as “the infinite divisibility of matter”was now universally allowed by the most approved and considerablephilosophers, hence it follows that there are an infinite number of parts ineach particle of matter which are not perceived by sense. “...In proportion,therefore, as the sense is rendered more acute, it perceives a greater numberof parts in the object, that is, the object appears greater, and its figurevaries.”*4. In other words the Self of the Idealist as the Not-self of theMaterialist, is purely maya, i.e., motion. But a still more importantcontradiction creeps in here, and curious to say, the very monster Berkeleyset out with lance in rest to overthrow, proves but a Quixotic windmill whichsends our gallant knight rolling in the very dust in which he had hoped to laylow the sceptical and monstrous giant. Thus in the place of disprovingscepticism he unconsciously cleared the way for the greatest of all sceptics –David Hume.*1. Time, vol. ii, p. 51.*2. Berkeley, throughout “The Principles,” as well as the “Dialogues,” overlooks theNewtonian law of gravity altogether, though he supposes that he himself is not the onlythinking entity in the world, his arguments lead one to infer that he is. As an Idealist heproves that nothing can exist except in mind; then finding he has overlooked the questionof God, as an Animist adds: that all things, he himself included, cannot exist except in themind of some Divine Being, failing (perhaps purposely) to see that such a Being was alsobut a figment of his mind.*3. Ibid. p. 79.*4. Ibid. p. 55.HUMEHume, at heart a thoroughgoing agnostic and man of the world, saw thepractical falsity of abstruse philosophy, the conclusions of which were atonce dissipated by the “feelings of our heart,” which reduced “the profoundphilosopher to a mere plebeian.” He forcibly asserts, that ideas of primaryqualities are attained by abstraction – “an opinion which if we examine itaccurately, we shall find to be unintelligible, and even absurd.” He furtheragrees with Berkeley in stating that: “An extension that is neither tangiblenor visible, cannot possibly be conceived,” and that, “The mind has never"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"anything present to it but the perceptions, and cannot possibly reach anyexperience of their connexion with objects.”*1. And again that the“...universal and primary opinion of all men is soon destroyed by theslightest philosophy, which teaches us, that nothing can ever be present tothe mind but an image or perception, and that the senses are only the inletsthrough which these images are conveyed, without being able to produceany immediate intercourse between the mind and the object.”*2. However,the great unknown waste of this “immediate intercourse” Hume bravely setsout to explore.*1. An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, p.163.*2. Ibid. p. 161.As Berkeley had previously got hopelessly bogged in the swamps of God, soHume, avoiding the shore line, set out on the same quest by way of thedesert of Scepticism, without the chart of so divine a knowledge, but withthe compass of a more certain direction; nevertheless, soon losing his way inthe arid wilderness of doubt, he also left the great riddle unanswered, to leapvoiceless midst the desert wind, and to dance songless ‘mongst his bleachedand rattling bones. Further on we shall see how Crowley, setting out withboth chart and compass, like a second Œdipus wrested the secret from theage-worn lips of the Sphinx; for as he himself says:Eternal mockery is the real; Eternal falsehood, the ideal.**Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 93.However, Hume arrives at a negative result of extraordinary worth. He tookNewton’s second law of motion,* i.e., of Cause and Effect, and wroteagainst it a colossal “WHY?”*Every change of motion is proportional to the force impressed, and is made in thedirection of that force.Berkeley, as we saw above, arrived at the conclusion, that it was impossibleto solve the question of relationship between the things which are perceived,and the things which are not perceived; and in the “Three Dialogues betweenHylas and Philonous” he further elaborates this proposition. Hume by aslightly different road arrives at an exactly similar conclusion, namely: how"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"is it possible to judge the relationship between cause and effect, or in otherwords the perceived and not perceived?“The first time a man saw the communication of motion by impulse...(billiard balls)... what alteration has happened to give rise to this new ideaof connexion? Nothing but that he now feels these events to be connected inhis imagination...”**An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, p. 78.Hume thus arrives at the conclusion that cause and effect can only beinferred from each other, and never known. “Beyond the constantconjunction of similar objects, and the consequent inference from one to theother, we have no notion of any necessity or connexion.”**An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, p. 85.“Their (bodies) secret nature, and consequently all their effects andinfluence, may change, without any change in their sensible qualities.

Can I do better than propose thedifficulty to the public, even though, perhaps, I have small hopes ofobtaining a solution?

And he continues further on: “Andthough he should be convinced that his understanding has no part in theoperation, he would nevertheless continue in the same course of thinking.There is some other principle which determines him to form such aconclusion.”*2.*1.

Having left Berkeley in thedark, feeling on the dusty shelves of his reason for a flint and steel in thespirituality of God, whereby he may burn in twain the gordian knot intowhich he has tangled his understanding; we now find Hume, in a similarmanner, groping for the handle of some bricked-up door, which will leadhim forth from the depths of that same night in which Berkeley has alreadylost his way.When Hume states: “he feels events to be connected in his imagination”; heis only reiterating the words of Philonous, when he says: “I have a notion ofSpirit, though I have not, strictly speaking, an idea of it. I do not perceive itas an idea, or by means of an idea, but know it by reflexion.” To whichHylas very properly replied: “Words are not to be used without a meaning.And, as there is no more meaning in spiritual Substance than in materialSubstance, the one is to be exploded as well as the other.” Philonous, inanswering Hylas then asserts acquaintance with that nature of the humansoul which Hume declared to be inconceivable. “How often must I repeat,that I know or am conscious of my own being; and that I myself am not myideas, but somewhat else, a thinking active principle, that perceives, knows,wills, and operates about ideas.”**Three Dialogues, p. 95.This “human soul” of Hume, the “I myself” of Berkeley are synonymousterms; in fact, they are one with the “purusha” of the Yogins, and the“magical stone” of the philosophic alchymists. Hume arrives at theconclusion: “that there is a species of scepticism, antecedent to all study andphilosophy, which is much inculcated by Des Cartes and others, as asovereign preservative against error and precipitate judgement. Itrecommends an universal doubt, not only of all our former opinions and"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"principles, but also of our very faculties, of whose veracity, say they, wemust assure ourselves, by a chain of reasoning, deducted from some originalprinciple which cannot possibly be fallacious or deceitful.

Hume starting with the proposition that ideas are copied fromimpressions ends in the unknown; Berkeley through a similar processdeclares bankruptcy in God: Kant does likewise, stating in his “Critic of pureReason”; “All knowledge (touching an object of mere reason) can becommunicated not logically but morally... I am morally certain... etc.” Butwhat he means by the word “morally” he does not explain, postulating inplace of an explanation an “à priori certainty.” To Hume’s scepticism heanswers: the object is unknowable per se, the subject is also unknowable perse, because they both vary, consequently ontology is impossible. But thelaws and forms of thoughts are universal and irrefragable, and form anunalterable standard of certainty whereby knowledge may be increased. Àpriori laws are not derived from experience, but belong to the inherentstructure of the mind. Kant then sets himself to answer the question: Howare synthetic judgements à priori possible? And his answer is: Unlesscognitions are synthetical they can add nothing to our previous knowledge,unless à priori they cannot be universal. Unless universal they cannot beapodictically true. Kant’s reasoning runs as follows: Firstly, there is asensibility, a power of being affected by objects, a passive faculty; secondly,an understanding, a faculty recognizing the affectations of the sensibility,this is active, and responds to stimulation. The sensibility, however, has itslaws, and to discover them, we must separate those which are multiple fromthose which are one. The objects are variable, the passive functions of themind remain invariable, the multiple he calls the material, the invariable hechristens form – Space and Time.Space and Time are therefore the indispensable conditions of all sensation,and according to Kant are not deducible from experience, consequently theyare à priori. The understanding, similarly as the sensibility, possesses certainforms called judgements, of which there are four classes: “quantity, quality,relation, and modality.” These are the à priori categories of theunderstanding, and they are synthetic."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"This à priori (Crowleyanity affirms) is no innate intuition at all, in factmerely an abstraction from experience, and an equivalence of statement.

To accomplish this end, and to avoid falling into thesame entanglement of empirical uncertainties (physical), groping about inthe dark for some weapon which might enable him to free his unfortunatemaster, himself fell into the same metaphysical pitfall, and contented himselfby declaring his strangling senior as “free.” In other words: “It (the source ofmetaphysical knowledge) consists, then, in knowledge à priori, that is,knowledge derived from pure understanding, pure reason” (p. 11).* [Then itis impossible and its extension zero; for the intension of reason and its formsare alike built up by experience, that of the race (H. Spencer).]*Bohn’s edition of the Prolegomena.Having postulated metaphysical knowledge, Kant then proceeds to subdivideit into two headings: 1, Analytic; 2, Synthetic judgements; the first Crowleywould identify with [verbal propositions], the second with [real]. First Kantstates: “All analytic judgements are based entirely on the principles ofcontradiction... and are... à priori” (p. 13), e.g., “Every body is extended,”... “Nobody is unextended,” e.g., “Gold is a yellow metal.”"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"“Now, to know this, I require no further experience beyond my conceptionof gold, which contains the proposition that this body is yellow and a metal”(p. 13).

Thus gold must be reducible to thenoumenon, and so disappear.]In the second proposition Kant says: That though there are syntheticjudgements à posteriori, “there are also others of an à priori certainty,”which “can never have their source solely... in the principle ofcontradiction” (p. 13). “Judgements of experience are always synthetic. Itwould be absurd to found an analytic judgement on experience” (p. 14).[Crowley at once answers, “All judgements are founded on experience. Thisprimary fallacy of à priori validity is clearly the root of the great follieswhich follow. 1+1=2 cannot be doubted, but it is a definition, and meansnothing, being arbitrary.

Mathematics is analytic, because a parabola is but a name, and all itsqualities are directly deducible from its definitions, etc., etc., and thereforecontained therein, though not seen. (b.) Mathematics is based on racialexperience, and even on individual learning; only a few highly developedbrains can apprehend its propositions. It may be doubted whether anysynthetic judgement exists at all; for the moment it is made it becomesanalytic. This is obvious of “A” and “E” propositions, and only not so of “I”and “O,” because the subject is impure.]Kant then rejecting metaphysics as a true science (p. 21), asserts, howeverwith confidence, “that certain pure synthetic cognitions are really given à"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"priori, namely; pure mathematics and pure natural science... both... partlyapodictically certain through mere Reason.” [However he fails to quote anysuch proposition! And his “apodictic certainty” only means that the humanmind is unable to transcend that limitation. Thus metaphysics is a merebranch of psychology, for one thing; for another, every result obtained ismerely a statement of limitation, and therefore every accession of knowledgeis a vision of a new vista of ignorance. Summa scientia nihil scire, has yetanother meaning.]Having then as he thought discovered an à priori basis to metaphysics, heplaces before his reader the crucial problem. “How are syntheticpropositions à priori possible”? And at the very outset, assuming puresynthetic knowledge from the Reason as real (p. 22), attacks the problem.“How is it possible when a conception is given me, I can pass out of it, andconnect it with another which is not contained in the former,” and explainsthe difficulty by assumed knowledge à priori, [Rendering Hume’s positionnow impregnable, thanks to ethnology, etc., etc.]; and then Kant asks, “Howis pure mathematics possible”? [Again falling into the fallacy of supposinghis own brain to be without a history, It is curious to note that Kant’s àpriori is but a recasting of the old myth of Pallas, Wisdom, springing full-armed from the brain of Zeus, and like the legend is a strangely falseassertion.] Thus, into the trap Kant sets out to rescue Hume from, he himselffalls, by asserting that: “it is only by means of the form of sensuous intuitionthat we can intuite things à priori, but in this way we intuite the objects onlyas they appear to our senses, not as they may be in themselves (p. 29). [ThusKant himself proves the noumenon, the sole refuge from scepticism, itself tobe sceptical.] Kant must have in some way felt the weakness of hisargument, since in the following page, he, in true Berkeleyan fashion, inorder to upset the sceptic, argues in a circle; and to prove the possibility of àpriori judgements, insists on the sceptic proving an à priori proposition.Having thoroughly entangled the sceptic, as he thinks, he launches out an“apodictic certainty,” very similar to Berkeley’s “God-idea,” and defines“Idealism” to “consist in the assertion that there exist none but thinkingentities.” [Crowley at once denies the “certainty,” and demands anexplanation of “thinking.”] Then working through the Berkeleyan argumentsbackwards, he arrives at defining.

Concerning whichHuxley states: “not one of these events is ‘more than probable’; though theprobability may reach such a very high degree that, in ordinary language, weare justified in saying that the opposite events are impossible.”**Essay on Hume, p. 155.This is even going a step in advance of Hume, who stated: “a miracle is aviolation of the laws of nature.”* As to the conservation of energy andmatter, Crowley would say: [“they were arguments in a circle (A); for theuse of scientific instruments by which they were discovered, implies theselaws.”] Kant would not say (A) but “à priori truth”; and as to the laws ofcause and effect, [if we accept causality, etc., then we must regard all astruly parts of one thing, perhaps even as aspects of one thing.] And Kant,after a series of analytical arguments, comes to the conclusion that thelegitimacy of natural laws “rests on the necessary connection of phenomenain an experience, in other words, on the original laws of the understanding,”(p. 67). The understanding drawing its laws à priori not from nature, butprescribing them to it.

Berkeley, as we have seen, opened thegateway of scepticism, and was the first to vanish in the Absolute ether ofPyrrhonism, which he outwardly symbolized under the form of a Bishop ofthe Church of England. Hume following, clutched vaguely in the night ofdoubt at a “something” he could not grasp, and whose watery substancetrickled through his clenched and searching fingers. Kant similarly losing hisway in the night of Hume’s ignorance, struck a spark on the tail of his shirt,proclaiming the day; but as the flames rose and scorched his fundamentalbasis, he, also, leapt from his empiric hose into the cool comfort of thatwatery ocean Hume had attempted to shadow in the palm of his hand. Thenbehind these three gallant knights clattered along their no less gallantesquires: Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, and in the distance, lost in the dust ofReason, stand the present-day yokels of thought, thinking at appointed hoursaccording to appointed books.FICHTE, SCHELLING, AND HEGELClose on the heels of Kant came Fichte with his unknowable appulse as theonly potency of the not-self, which assuaged the raging thirst of inquiry aswould a bottle of wine long since dry. Behind him Schelling, who leapinginto the clouds, grasped at object and subject as existing actualities, callingthe bastard children of his brain manifestations of the Absolute. Then Hegelwho, instead of sitting out on the universal stairs with Berkeley’s “Bishop,”waltzed wildly with some ethereal Absolute, which, whether object orsubject, was in no case existence, merely the skeleton of some phantomappearance, having no life in itself, but solely in the absolute mirror of itsreflection. Each of these Titans, in his own manner, threw fresh fuel on tothe Berkeleyan conflagration, so hoping that, by piling up the blazing mass,they might illumine the entire universe. And how they failed the last fivedecades have only too directly shown, by their stagnation in the realms of acertain and unknowable Absolute; and in the parasitic growths of ScientificAgnosticism, Scientific Positivism, Scientific Monism, and the general"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"overwhelming materialization of present-day thought. Yet the self per seremains just as unknowable in a positive degree, as it would have, had all theages forever held their peace. Nevertheless the arguments which they setforth, ideal or material, have in their frantic efforts to support it, forced thewhole gigantic structure to the ground. From these ruins of experienceCrowley now rises up a fiery phoenix, directing us to the only possible waywhich will lead us to our much-desired haven of rest. Motion must cease, irritation must be prevented, Time and Spaceannihilated, and the divine “I” set free from the sordid rags of the world, tobe clothed in the brilliancy of God.* This added “impulse,” which in thehomogeneous protoplasm causes fission, is as mystical to-day as that added“something” which will cause the mind of one man to admire a Wagnerianopera, and another a drawing by Beardsley. No sound is in the air, vibrationsonly pass. No sound is in the brain, molecular changes only result. Wherethen is sound? It is a creation in the mind by the divine “I”; that unextendedabsolute Passivity, whose dwelling is in that equilibrating activity whichbalances action and reaction.*It should never for a moment be forgotten that any attempt to construct a positivephilosophic system from these data would be strenuously repudiated by Crowley. Thedanger constantly recurs, because in the normal (educated) man the reason is master. Likethe hydra of Hercules, its heads grow again; they must be branded by the torch ofilluminism, as well as smitten off by the sword of scepticism.Hegel (outside the realms of the divine philosophers) was one of the veryfew who partially grasped the supreme truth of Crowleyanity, when hepostulated: “Being and Non-Being are the same.” He saw that pure being is,in its last analysis, beyond fertilization, development, or motion, and ispractical nothingness. “The fertilization of Being, according to Hegel, arose by the passing over, asit were, of Being into its antitheses, otherness, or complement – that is, intoNon-Being. But this antithesis, otherness, complement, was in a real senseBeing itself, for Being and Non-Being, being equally nothingness, are in thesame category. Herein, however, were motion, interaction, stimulus, and noresponse to stimulus rendered, not only a possibility, but a reality; and PureBeing, thus enriched or fertilized by the double interaction, becamemanifested as existence – that is, conditioned Being. Pure Being, theUnconditioned, the Absolute of Potentiality rolled round into pure Non-"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Being, the Unconditioned; the Absolute of Impotentiality, emerged,energized, and conditioned, and became the Limited, the Relative. This isthe groundwork of the Hegelian philosophy.”**Absolute Relativism, p. 114.Yet once again that added impulse arises in the passing over. What is it?Crowleyanity does not, in words, explain; for being beyond reason, it is bothinexplicable and undefinable in rational terms; yet it directs, and the wearytraveller, searching for the stone of the wise, has but to follow, guided by thesure and certain hope that if he so will, it will guide him to that great andglorious transfiguration he so ardently desires.TIMEKant, as we have seen, places both Time and Space in the realm of the àpriori; a realm utterly devastated by Crowley’s scepticism. Spencer inanswering the questions, What is Space? What is Time? replied, “Space isthe abstract of all relations of co-existence. Time is the abstract of allrelations of sequence.” These definitions have been found wanting, chieflyon account of the doubtful connotation of the word abstract, but withMcTaggart’s emendation read:Space is the synthesis of all experiences of co-existence. Time is the synthesis of all experiences of sequence.**Absolute Relativism, p. 14.So we find that taking the above as general definitions, they may with equalaccuracy be applied to either the Ego or the race; in the former case, Spaceand Time vanishing with the extinction of the individual; in the latter withthat of the race. So also if space be defined as “the potentiality of all co-existences,” then in the destruction of all existences Space will also cease tobe. But if Space be defined “as that eternal actuality wherein all other thingsor no things may co-exist, then, even on the destruction of all things, Spacewould still remain.”* Yet this definition is extremely faulty, as Time re-mains to be considered; which we shall now deal with.*Absolute Relativism, p. 15."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"In Crowley’s essay bearing the name of “Time” the matter is set forth in adialogue between a British sceptic and an Indian mystic. In it, by a ratherdifferent route, he comes to a somewhat similar conclusion to that taught byEckhart in Germany at the beginning of the fourteenth century. “That thecreature apart from the Absolute, that is, God, was nothing, that ‘Time,Space, and the plurality which depends on them,’ are also nothing inthemselves, and that the duty of man as a moral being is to rise beyond thisnothingness of the creature, and by direct intuition to place himself inimmediate union with the Absolute.”*1. The two disputants, Scepticus andMysticus, set out by agreeing that the unknowable is unreal, and as the lattersays with Berkeley, “a thing is only real to us so far as it is known by us.”*2.*1.

Scepticus answerssomething about the earth moving round the sun, and is at once shown byMysticus that a man stating a fact in reference to “Since the Derby was run,”would be more intelligible than he who would say, “Since May, such andsuch a day”; “...for his memory is of the race, and not of a particular item inthe ever changing space-relation of the heavens, a relation which he cannever know, and of which he can never perceive the significance; nay, whichhe can never recognize, even by landmarks of catastrophic importance.”*3.Scepticus at once grasps the absurdity of such a situation by picturing thecross-examination of a farm-hand by a lawyer:*1. Time, vol. ii, p. 269.*2. Ibid. vol. ii, p. 270.*3. Ibid. vol. ii, p. 272.“Now, Mr. Noakes, I must warn you to be very careful.

Scepticus goes on to statethat H. G. Wells has put his finger on the very spot whence all research mustbegin: and that is, “the illusionary nature of the time-idea.”*2. “You wouldsay that of two men born on a day, dying on a day, one may be young, theother old... he lives the longest who remembers most.”*3. Mysticusconsiders the definition insufficient unless the “vividness of eachimpression” is added to the “number of impressions.” Scepticus then showsthat it would be possible in thought to construct a scale of vividness from ato n, by which we could erect a formula to express all that a man is. “Forexample, he might be: 10 a+33125 b+890 c+800112 658 e+992f+...+...+...n, and, if we can find the ratio of a:b:c:d:e:f...:n, we can resolvethe equation into a single term, and compare man and man.”*4.*1.

Their Godis but a friend, a mighty man who will eventually pull them out of thepresent bog of existence; being too lazy to do so themselves, they invest himwith special powers; once fashioned, the next step was to endow him with animmortalizing energy, and then, curious to say, they discovered he had giventhem, as a slight reward, an immortal soul for all the trouble they had takenin turning him out a really nice, amiable, and respectable Deity. Havingmagnified their friend into a God, they then proceeded to enlarge theirenemy into a Devil. This gross materialism in accordance with the universallaw of polarity, set in motion by the hand of Idealism, produced as effect afanciful spiritualism, which sought in the mysteries of life an answer that laystill on the cold lips of Death. These two powers, the Pantheonic materialismand the Gnostic spiritualism, bore the hybrid – Christianity.As all religions have finally become subservient to an interested priesthood,so have all religions (however spiritual they may have been in their youth)been materialized and sacrificed on the altar of gain. To this rule Christianityforms no exception; once crudely and sincerely spiritual, it has becomedeceitfully materialistic.God, who was formerly an Almighty Pleroma, is now but the moke whichcarries the priest’s eggs to market; and Christ, the Saviour and Redeemer,the stick with which the wretched old jennet is beaten along. Christianity isno longer what its name implies, the system of doctrines as taught by Christ,but diametrically the reverse, the system of desires as wrought by Man. It isno longer “Sell all,” but “Seize all”; or “Give all,” but “Get all.” Mammon is"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"the God of to-day, and modern Christianity is absolute and unadulteratedmaterialism. As such it is not necessary to look far for its antithesis.Religions decay through materiality, and whenever religions decaymysticism arises; for materiality cannot explain existence, neither can itquench the thirst of man. Since Christianity has suffered from senile decay,what have we found? A new religion? No. An old religion? Yes.Rejuvenated? Yes. Man is too lazy to build if he can reconstruct. The greatmass of the people yearn for something better than the existing conceptionsof Faith; leaderless, disunited, they fall an easy prey to the charlatans whoever keep their finger on the social pulse, and are ever as willing to pose,when opportunity is offered, as seer, clairvoyant, or palmist, as they are astrickster, tout, or quack. And the result? A vast drift of earnest aspirationsseething in an ocean of ignorance. The great thoughts of old prostituted tothe gains and stupidity of modernity, a great libel foisted on the past tosatisfy the credulity of the present; a systematized thieving from the statue ofIsis to adorn the idol of Mammon, god of bankers, brigands, and beggars.Astrology gave us astronomy, and Alchemy gave us chemistry, both wereantagonistic to the ideas of their day; let us hope that Psychical Researchwill give us a purer metaphysics.Now the question before us here, is: how does all this decaying and growingof ideals affect the poetic philosophy of Aleister Crowley? And the answeris as follows:To the writer of this essay it seems on reading Aleister Crowley’s poems thatthe revolt against existing ideals and morals is more the outcome ofspontaneous intuition than of meditative scepticism: and so strong is thecurrent, and so diverse and intricate are its eddies, that for one who is not anadept, it seems almost a forlorn hope to plunge into the boiling cataract ofhis ontologic philosophy, with any expectation of reaching the further bankin safety. It would perhaps seem safer to forego such an attempt altogether,but so alloyed have these mystical ideas become with the general structureof his philosophy, that such a course is rendered impossible, so that thefailure of safety would be only more ignominious than the failure of attempt.Aleister Crowley as we have seen is no Christian, neither is he a gulliblespiritualist, nor a gross materialist. Seeking an answer to the mystery, he firstfinds it in the ontology of the Qabalah, and then finally through Mysticismand Agnosticism, to their reconciliation in a neo-Hermeticism, a neo-Rosicrucianism – which we have already called Crowleyanity.*"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"*Not only has Crowley succeeded in finding all the scattered pieces of Osiris which Isisdiscovered, but also his phallus which she could not find.Yet though he does not end at that barrier beyond which the Rationalistcannot proceed, he by no means rejects common sense and understanding ashis Epode on Nature clearly shows.Nature my name is called.

In one degree"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"at least they are right, for the mysticism as contained in these systems ofthought is as old as thought itself.The great system of the Qabalah is one of emanation – a type of spiritualmonism, an attempted explanation of the nature of the Deity, within thelimitations of mind. Its correspondence with the Talmud is more of methodthan material. That it was of slow growth is very certain, that it is aconglomerated mass of a multitude of efforts is also most sure. The Zohar isits corner-stone, and the date of its construction extends probably from thesecond to the seventh century of the present era. Much of its logic,psychology, metaphysics, philosophy, and theology, is drawn directly fromthe Midrash. To make it superior to profane literature its simplicity has atvarious times been cloaked in a truculent obscurantism, many of its studentsdelighting in paraphrases and hermeneutical constructions. Because of theirunintelligibility words were transposed, numericalisms added, till at lastmuch if not all its sense was lost in a maze of mental legerdemain, and insuch exegetical methods as Gematria, Temurah, and Notariqon, which on thevery face of the argument seem to condemn a system which aimed atsupplying mankind with a great and beautiful truth.We should not like to say that Aleister Crowley’s poems are entirelyguiltless of the accusation of obscurity; but to the uninitiated more liesbelow the surface than is ever dreamt of; and we do not consider that the usewhich he frequently makes of words, or rather names of an inward grace,should be considered as obscure. It is not difficult for the most uninstructedin the Qabalah to discover that Binah is equivalent to inspiration orunderstanding, that Chokmah means wisdom or revelation, or in fact tograsp the simpler ideas contained in the Sephirotic Scheme. Without suchknowledge, in fact, half the pleasure is lost in not understanding thesepoems, and a false idea of an attempt to “flummox” the reader’s mind arises.A mystery is simply an unanswered riddle. If to a person who knows not asingle word of Urdu, I use such expressions as “suar,” “sala,” “bahinchut,”they to his mind will be entirely sterile of meaning; but not so, however, tothe initiated, who would highly appreciate them (unless applied to himself).Such use of words appears only absurd to these who fail to understand theirmeaning. A word may be charged with meaning just as a battery may becharged with electricity. Unconditionally there is little difference, beyondthe literation, between “Hocus-pocus” and “Gee-up.” If I say the latter to mytowel-horse, I do not expect it to break into a canter; if, however, I say it tomy pony, and it holds the key of this mystery, I do; so with any other word.

As in physics there is a kinetic force,so in metaphysics there is a kinetic ideation. To the Qabalist, the Qabalahunlocks as a key the corridor of the soul, and the pent-up sense rushes forthas some prisoner released from his dungeon, a mingled mass of emotion andreality. To the sceptic no change takes place, far his mind is sterile andunable to conceive, but his ignorance in no way proves that the Qabalah ismere Buncombe. Because a weak man cannot lift a certain weight, that is nocriterion that a strong man cannot. There is truth in everything, and truth liesbeyond mere utility. If we cannot understand, it is sheer falsehood to say Yesor No, the agnostic mode being the only right course open to us; yet if itwere put to us to answer such a question as “Is the reverse of the moonstudded with tintacks?” “No!” would naturally be the correct answer, andnot, “I cannot tell you”; for as long as the bastion of our doubt is strongerthan the cannon of our enemies’ assertion, we then, temporarily at least,have every right to answer in the negative.To be a student of the mysterious is a very different thing from being amystic. That the author was the latter must surely be disproved on reading“Ascension Day” and “Pentecost,” that he belongs to the neo-mystics ortheosophists is openly denied in a note to the former poem, and in thepreliminary invocation to “Jephthah.” In which latter poem the followingmay be aptly quoted as showing how that, when reason lies fallow, modernspiritism is steadily supplanting Christianity:Master, the night is falling yet again. I hear dim tramplings of unholy forces:I see the assembly of the foully slain: The scent of murder steams: riderless horsesGallop across the earth, and seek the inane: The sun and moon are shaken in their courses: The kings are gathered, and the vultures fall Screaming, to hold their ghastly festival.**Jephthah, vol. i, p. 66.The search after Mystery is finely described in the opening dedication of“The Songs of the Spirit”:"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Mine was the holy fire that drew Its perfect passion from the dew, And all the flowers that blushed and blewOn sunny slopes by little brooks.Mine the desire that brushed asideThe thorns, and would not be denied,And sought, more eager than a bride,The cold grey secret wan and wide of sacredbooks.**Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 29.It is in this search that the soul unfurls its wings and sweeps into the infiniteether of existence, bending its course towards God in its own unutterableideal.With burning eyes intent to penetrateThe black circumference, and find out God.**Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 32.In “The Alchemist,” or in that beautiful poem “The Farewell of Paracelsus toAprile.” “Struggling in vain to what one hopes the best.”* We find thislarger hope is here the keynote, as it is in so many of Crowley’s poems; tomention perhaps the most noted, we find this sacred flame flashing forth in“Aceldama,” “Paracelsus,” “The Ultimate Voyage,” “The Nameless Quest,”“The Neophyte,” and in “Tannhäuser.” Many of the poems in “Songs of theSpirit” and “The Holy of Holies,” hold fast to this idea; and it is this ideal,the progression from the Kingdom to the Crown, from Malkuth to Kether,which constitutes one of the most beautiful doctrines of the older andsimpler Qabalah. *Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 40.The Qabalah guides us to a divine theurgy.

Over the face of the whole world we findearnest thought arriving at or towards such a conclusion. In ancient Chinawe hear Lao-Tze declaring: “What is there superior in Heaven and Earth,and from which Heaven and Earth sprung? Nay, what is there superior toSpace and which moves in Space? The great Tao is the parent of Space, andSpace is the parent of Heaven and Earth, and Heaven and Earth producedmen and things...” A similar conception of the Wisdom is held in theChaldaic, Memrah; in the Vach, or word, of the Rig Veda; in the Honover orword, of the Zend Avesta; in the Avalôkitêsvara, or Kwan-Yin, the Sakti ofAmitâbha, the boundless light of the later Mahayana Buddhists. Again wefind it in the conception of Prana or life spirit of ancient India; the Atharva-veda says: “Reverence to Prana, to whom the universe is subject, who hasbeen lord of all, on whom all is supported.” Prana is the Purusha or AUM,the totality of Brahman, Vishnu, and Siva, of Past, Present, and Future.

We cannottruly affirm: ‘Nothingness is green, or heavy, or sweet.’“Let us call time, space, being, heaviness, hunger, the categories. If a man beheavy and hungry, he is extended in all these, besides, of course, manymore. But let us suppose, that these five are all. Call the man X; his formulais then Xt+s+b+h+h. If he now eat, he will cease to be extended in hunger; if hebe cut off from time and gravitation as well, he will now be represented bythe formula Xs+b. Should he cease to occupy space and to exist, his formulawould then be X0. This expression is equal to 1; whatever X may represent,if it be raised to the power of 0 (this meaning mathematically, ‘if it beextended in no dimension or category’), the result is Unity, and the unknownfactor X is eliminated.“This is the Advaitist idea of the future of man; his personality, bereft of allits qualities, disappears and is lost, while in its place arises the impersonalUnity, The Pleroma, Parabrahma, or the Allah of the Unity-adoringfollowers of Mohammed.

That it exists not in themind is agreed; and that it exists not in place is no less certain – since allplace or extension exists only in the mind, as hath been already proved. Itremains, therefore, that it exists nowhere at all”*1. i.e., in the Absolute Zero.And again he asserts, this time by the word of Philonous: “Consequentlyevery corporal substance being the substratum of extension must have initself another extension, by which it is qualified to be a substratum: and soon to infinity? And I ask whether this be not absurd in itself, and repugnantto what you granted just now, to wit, that the substratum was somethingdistinct from and exclusive of extension?”*2.

Beingforms of extension, Space permits Size, and Time, Number, i.e., inConsciousness. This is the meaning of “Time is the fourth Dimension.” Sothe hard thinking of Crowley arrives eventually at the transcendental idea ofconsidering Space as a plane, and nearness as Time.“Can Space be identified with Matter (Akasa, means both), and Time withMotion?” Crowley answers, “Yes.” [For in extension Space is the singleimmovable consciousness; Time the extension in number, the motion of theimmobiles.

This taken together reduces the universe to alot of minima cogitabilia, linked only by Time; Anima explained by Ratio.*Space is Geometry: Time is Arithmetic, i.e., the geometrical conception, themathematical conception. Thus, if I {see/think of} a blue pig ten times, thatis ten blue pigs; yet in Space there is but one blue pig. Can we reduce Space– which I spiritually comprehend so well, intellectually so badly – to a formof Time (which, vice versa?) Yes, if we suppose that a really accurate{definition/division} of consciousness would show that only the “minimumcogitabile” was truly apprehended at once.] Thus in the comprehension ofCrowleyanity Space seems “Anima,” Time “Ratio.”*Angelus Silesius also beautifully shows how Time and Space are but inverse measuresof the force of the soul, in the Cherubic Wanderer, where he writes:Rise above Space and Time, and thou canst be At any moment in Eternity.Sit in the centre, and thou seest at once,What is, what was; all here and all in heaven.I am as great as God, and he as small as I;He cannot me surpass, or I beneath him lie.Self is surpassed by self-annihilation; The nearer nothing, so much more divine.Who is as though he were not – ne’er had been –That man, oh joy! is made God absolute."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"BUDDHISMAs regards the beginning of all things the Buddhist is discreetly silent, he (asCrowley says) neither prevaricates like the Hindu, nor openly lies like theChristian.In the Is’a Upanishad we read:Into dense darkness he entersWho has conceived becoming to be naught, Into yet denser heWho has conceived becoming to be aught.In the second discourse of the Bhagavad-Gītā we also read:Uncleavable He, incombustible He, and indeed neither to bewetted nor dried away; perpetual, all-pervasive, stable, immovable,ancient, unmanifest, unthinkable, immutable He is called.This is very much like the Athanasian Creed, after having defined God inevery possible way, to end up by describing him as “incomprehensible.” Notso the Buddhist who went back to the older vedic conception:In the beginning there is existence blind and withoutknowledge; and in this sea of ignorance there are appetencesformative and organizing. — The Questions of King Milinda.We must, however, pass by the question of beginning, and see how theBuddhistic ideals have affected the poetry and philosophy of AleisterCrowley.According to Buddhism, existence is sorrow, the cause of sorrow is desire,the cessation of sorrow is the cessation of desire, which can only be realizedby following the Noble Eightfold path.

Thus by rendering all knowledge automorphological, inorder to annihilate the unity of thirty-nine articles without parts or passions,rearing himself up, he plunged down, creating in his fall, “a footless stockingwithout a leg“ – Unknowability.In “Eleusis” Crowley illustrates this, and says: “Evolution is no better than creation to explain things, as Spencer showed.”**Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 228.Huxley the sublime philosopher, the true agnostic, the periphery of whoseknowledge extended far into those mirrored realms wherein Spencer onlysaw his own distorted countenance, seeing well that Hylo-Idealistic-Solipsism led the whole sentient creation from sub-rational matter to rationalman, was sufficiently a true agnostic not to deny the possibility of a divineSolipsism, leading rational man to a super-rational God, but yet notsufficiently illuminated to transmute ”I doubt” into ”I know.” However,Huxley grasped the great and grand truth that the natural philosopher whoexamines worlds, suns, and stars, is in reality only experimenting on his own“inner consciousness,” beyond which to him there is Nothing.These stars thou seest Are but the figuring of thy brain.*"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 89.This Nothing, this absolute nihility, is again the Qabalistic Zero.

The Caput Mortuumwas his playground, but the Anima Vitae eluded his eager grasp; yet thisgreatest of modern philosophers, curious to say, stood almost alone, on oneside growling science asserting, “There is no Archaeus,” on the otherreligion howling ”There is! There is!” Yet as a positive and a negativeformulate Zero, so these twain were as one yelping pack of jackals, whoprowl by night fearing the brightness of the day.Huxley aptly sums up the standpoint an Agnostic should take in thefollowing:If a piece of lead were to remain suspended of itself in the air,the occurrence would be a “miracle” in the sense of a wonderfulevent, indeed; but no one trained in the methods of science wouldimagine that any law of nature was really violated thereby. He wouldsimply set to work to investigate the conditions under which so highlyunexpected an occurrence took place, and thereby enlarge hisexperience, and modify his hitherto unduly narrow conceptions of thelaws of nature.**Huxley’s Hume, p. 155. “It will be said that these are miracles, but we reply thatmiracles, when they are genuine, are simply facts for science.”“A philosopher has declared that he would discredit universal testimony ratherthan believe in the resurrection of a dead person, but his speech was rash, for it is on thefaith of universal testimony that he believed in the impossibility of the resurrection.Supposing such an occurrence were proved, what would follow? Must we deny evidence,or renounce reason? It would be absurd to say so. We should simply infer that we werewrong in supposing resurrection to be impossible.”“Ab actu ad posse valet consecutio.” —E.

The second great principle is the Conservationof Matter and Energy, or in other words the law of Cause and Effect. A lawwe have gone to some length in demonstrating to be apodictically untenable,though highly probably à posteriori. Crowley, like Hume and Huxley, solelyidentifies it as a law based upon inference. This sequence of events is vividlydemonstrated in “The Mother’s Tragedy.” Cora thinks, “God hath madesmooth the road beneath the hearse of my forgetful age.” Not so however:They know not, learn not, cannot calculate How subtly FateWeaves its fine mesh, perceiving how to wait; Or how accumulateThe trifles that shall make it master yetOf the strong soul that bade itself forget.**The Mother’s Tragedy, vol. i, pp. 156-7.Qabalistic Dogma of Pistorius."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Factum fatum quia fatum verbum est.A supreme reason governs all, and hence there is no fatality; all which is must be;all which happens ought to take place.

It is morning; I walk down the hill to catch a train;as I walk I literally leave shreds of myself behind me. I am no longer the “I“of five minutes ago, fleeting I pass along life’s way.

Crumpled as some much-written palimpsestI am thrown to the basket of the dead, a useless manuscript. When was I,“I”; in the morning when I crushed the daisy, when I slew the fly, or when Iwas converted into pulp? Which? The Buddhist answers, “you were never‘I,’” the Agnostic answers, “You were never ‘I,’” both merely state – seethat on the papyrus of thy life thou inscribest what is good, what is beautiful,for others must read it, it is thy soul.Change, change, no stability. The “is“ is not as the ”was,” and the “was” isnot as the “will be”; every cause has its effect: “Freewill” is the postulate ofMorality, “Determination” of Science. Thus in Buddhism we find Anikka,Dukkha, and Anatta, and in Agnosticism Change, Sorrow, and Absence ofan Ego; and in both: That to deny all religions is a sublime act of faith.The metaphysics of these verses Is perfectly absurd.

Kant hasproved beyond all doubt, that by empirical means we can never hope topenetrate beyond the tremendous night of Reason; then came Fichte,Schelling, and Hegel, they, peering into the depths of the Darkness, here andthere saw some fleeting asteroid; after them came Huxley, who gloominginto the depths, far in the distance, saw the whirling cloud of stars, stillbeyond him must we go, beyond that trembling cloud which hovers as sometired dove on the horizon of our minds, past nebulæ of stars and molten sunssinging midst new-born spheres and hoary-headed worlds, “I would that Iwere the sky that I might be all eyes to behold thee,” till the stars circleabout us, and the wild comets speed by, and suns embrace suns, and themoons melt shrieking through the firmament. Then all powers will dissolve,and the great golden dawn effulgent will flash through the portals of night,standing before us bride of our desire, robed in a minion suns, the starsflaming in her hair, incarnate symbol of perpetual youth.So we feel with Crowley that:Time and again, in the History of Science, a period has arrivedwhen, gorged with facts, she has sunk into a lethargy of reflectionaccompanied by appalling nightmares in the shape of impossibletheories.*"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"*The Sword of Song, p. 207.And that:History affirms that such a deadlock is invariably the prelude toa new enlightenment; by such steps we have advanced, by such weshall advance.

We rank thegreat adepts with the madmen of God, whose miracles are mere imitations,whose powers are mere pretensions, and whose illumination is merereflection; but what is it then these great beings imitate, pretend to, orreflect? Here lies the dark question which no denial can disprove, noassertion comprehend, and which work alone through the alembic of ourhearts can reveal and accomplish.THE ADEPTSIt is this something, this light which every Adept sets out to discover; for,whether in the dark night of the neophyte, or the noonday brilliancy of thesupreme magus, Reason deserts us, and we at length are forced to seek adiviner illumination beyond those dark realms of rational understanding.Crowley writes on this point, in “Eleusis,” as follows:"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Not while reason is, as at present, the best guide known to men,not until humanity has developed a mental power of an entirelydifferent kind.

Mansel saw it and counsels usto try Faith, as if it was not the very fact that Faith was futile that badeus appeal to reason. Huxley saw it, and, no remedy presenting itselfbut a vague faith in the possibilities of human evolution, calledhimself an agnostic: Kant saw it for a moment, but it soon hid itselfbehind his terminology; Spencer saw it, and tried to gloss it over bysmooth talk, and to bury it beneath the ponderous tomes of hisunwieldy erudition.**Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 228.This may be further amplified by the following quotation fromEckartshausen:In time and space knowledge is but relative. Is it not true thatall which we call reality is but relative, for absolute truth is not to befound in the phenomenal world. Thus your natural reason does notpossess its true essence, but only the appearance of truth and light:and the more the essence of light inwardly fades, and the manconfuses himself with this appearance, and gropes vainly after thedazzling phantasmal images he conjures.**The Cloud upon the Sanctuary, p. 3.This appearance of Truth is practically what the Hindu would call ”maya,”in which all created beings live. There is a way which leads beyond it, andany man can discover it, if he be fit and willing, and this way leads to God.The Absolute Truth lying in the centre of mystery is like thesun, it blinds ordinary sight, and man sees only the shadow.

Ignorance or Knowledge have nothing to dowith illumination any more than pig has to do with Chicago pork; yet asthere are standards of knowledge, so are there degrees of illumination; forthere is not the slightest doubt that Booth and Robert Evans stand on a muchlower footing than a St. Augustine or a Paracelsus; yet nevertheless,Boehme, who was only a shoemaker, ranks with them.*2. “It is no doubtmore difficult,” writes Crowley, “to learn ‘Paradise Lost’ by heart than ‘Weare seven,’ but when you have done it, you are no better at figureskating.”*3. So a Boehme may rank with an Augustine, whilst an Evans maynot.*1. Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 220.*2.

After the colossal fable of Œdipus we find the gracious poemof Psyche, which was certainly not invented by Apuleius. The great magical arcanumreappears here under the figure of a mysterious union between a god and a weak mortalabandoned alone and naked on a rock. Psyche must remain in ignorance of the secret ofher ideal royalty, and if she behold her husband she must lose him. —E. Lévi, TheDoctrine of Transcendent Magic, p. 16.Inspiration does not enter into the understanding, it illuminates a deeper partof the Ego, and under its influence the imagination is diverted from thespeculative understanding to more active powers which release theimprisoned “I.” When once these powers are released from the earthy graspof the understanding, and the Ego sloughs its outward empirical skin, wethen become mystics; nevertheless, “If any man say, I love God, and hatethhis brother, he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth,"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"how can he love God whom he seeth not.” So the mystic’s work lies here inlife, and the greatest and most divine mystics have probably been thosewhose naïveté of soul was such, that they knew not that they were mystics;and whose illumination has become so brilliant, that they cannot even findexpression in the most divine of symbols. Such adepts who arrive at soexalted a plane, keep silence, as Crowley says: “the first and last ordeals andrewards of the Adept are comprised in the maxim ‘Keep Silence’!”**Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 221. “TO KNOW, TO DARE, TO WILL, TO KEEP SILENT, are thefour words of the magus, inscribed upon the four symbolic forms of the Sphinx.“To command the elements, we must have overcome their hurricanes, theirlightnings, their abysses, their tempests.“In order to DARE we must KNOW; in order to WILL we must DARE; we mustWILL to possess empire, and to reign we must BE SILENT.” —E.

In the first theAdepts rise as artists, philosophers, and men of science, who are sooner orlater recognized as great men; in the second the adepts as adepts appear, butseem as fools and knaves; and in the third, that of Slime, vanish altogether,and are invisible.* Then the chain starts again. Thus Crowley writes:*Dionysius thus describes the mystical adept: “Then is he delivered from all seeing andbeing seen, and passes into the truly mystical darkness of ignorance, where he excludesall intellectual apprehensions, and abides in the utterly impalpable and invisible; beingwholly His who is above all, with no other dependence, either on himself or any other;and is made one, as to his nobler part, with the Utterly Unknown, by the cessation of allknowing; and at the same time, in that very knowing nothing, he knows what transcendsthe mind of man.” —De Mysticâ Theologiâ, cap. i, p. 710.Decadence marks the period when the adepts, nearing theirearthly perfection, become true adepts, not mere men of genius.

Samâdhi is theengineer who manipulates the engine.

Passing to that state beyond progress, which is purefreedom and divine Will, man reaches the stage when he ceases to thinkempirically under the schemata of Time and Space. The mind at suchmoments reaches heights wherein another light succeeds to the light ofexperience; there is a mental “whirl” which, though irrational to pure reason,has an incalculable value, probably depending on certain higher lawsunknown to the rational world. When the soul has reached this point, law, inthe rational sense of the term, has ceased to have any existence, and ithenceforth enters into direct communion with the Good; which is its ownlaw.Thus when we have raised our hearts to the nth power, we become as Godsknowing good and evil; and if this raising of the heart, which Crowley sobrilliantly sets forth throughout his works, can in any way lead a man into anobler and higher insight of himself, no one can ever doubt then that it isright for him to so raise it.We have already seen from Dr. Maudsley what dangers have to be expectedby those who chose this hill-top track to follow.

It is something quite other than myself, and forthis reason I am frozen with terror; it is something identical withmyself, and therefore I am kindled with love.**St. Augustine, Confessions, vii, ix, x.Similarly John Tauler writes:The more the Bridegroom loves the Bride, the more bitter willbe the cup he gives her to drink. “The cup is that she is to cease fromall her own thoughts... for she can take pleasure in nothing that is nother own.” She must be made like the Bridegroom, and humbly submitto the process, and joy in suffering for his sake, until she “is whollypurified from all faults and stain of sin, and become perfectly fair andunspotted.” Her wedding gift is “The Holy Ghost.” He sheds forthupon the Bride the torrent of divine love... insomuch that the Brideloseth herself and is intoxicated with love, so that she forgets herself,and all creatures in time or eternity together with herself... The joythat the Bride hath with the Bridegroom is so vast that no senses orreason can apprehend or attain unto it.”**John Tauler, by W.P. Swainson, p. 13.These two men had glimpses into total consciousness, of which clearconsciousness, as Ribot says, is but a small portion, just as distinct vision isbut a small portion of total vision.**Vide note Science and Buddhism, vol. ii, p. 258.The mystic, as the yogi, sets out to know the unknowable, and as “it is justas grave an illusion to attribute morality to a stone as it is to think to find the"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"supernatural in the world of phenomena,”*1. so in the inmost depths of theego alone, itself unthinkable, lies the source of all mystic experience. “I live,yet not I, but God in me.” This is the suspense of Job, the sleep of Solomon,the silence of St. John, arrived at by fixing the mind upon one single objectof thought, so that the treasures of representation which lie dormant in thememory, flow towards that one object and overwhelm and engulf it in adivine glory, as Eckartshausen says: “With, however, the development of thenew organ... the curtain is all at once raised, the impenetrable veil is tornaway, and the cloud before the Sanctuary lifts, a new world suddenly existsfor us, scales fall from our eyes, and we are at once transported from thephenomenal world to the region of truth.*2.*1.

I may here point out that not only in their Sapphic brilliance,but also in their mirrored mysticism, so many of Crowley’s poems are akin to the esotericteaching of the Sufi poets of Persia, such as Jeláladdín and Jámi. A very beautiful parableof Jeláladdín runs as follows:One knocked at the Beloved’s Door; and a Voice asked from within, “Who isthere?” and he answered, “It is I.” Then the Voice said, “This House will not hold Me and"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Thee.” And the Door was not opened. Then went the Lover into the Desert, and fastedand prayed in Solitude. And after a year he returned, and knocked again at the Door.

Fitzgerald’s Salámán and Absál.As do the following lines of Jámi:Gaze, till Gazing out of GazingGrew a BEING Her I gaze on,SHE and I no more, but in OneUndivided Being blended.All that is not one must everSuffer with the Wound of Absence;And whoever in Love’s CityEnters, finds but Room for ONE,And but in ONENESS Union.And those of Feridoddin Attar:Joy! joy! no mortal thought can fathom me.

I have often been carried away by it... there is suchperfection of joy that soul and body cannot express it... if they could theperfect union of all the powers would be at an end.”*I.N.R.I.So Crowley finely describes:Death from the universal force Means to the forceless universe Birth.

We will now show the chief means which were employed by theadepts of the West in gaining this end.Though, as it would be only natural to expect, the Christian Church stronglyrepudiated the idea of connection between her Ceremonial practices andthose of Magic,*1. for she has always denied relationship to those who liveoutside the brothel, the asylum, and the jail; and further, in this case, burntand destroyed countless thousands of innocent and erudite persons on theauthority of a divine book she had rendered obscene by her whorishthumbmarks; nevertheless, in spite of her Lodges and her logic, the greatestof her sons and daughters, as we have already seen, were mystics andmagicians pure and simple; this no doubt accounts for the comparativesafety and dignity with which the early fathers travelled in the East, and thegreatest of her ceremonies were entirely of a magical nature. I defy any oneto find any essential difference between the Spiritual Exercises of St.Ignatius and the practices of Raja Yoga; space here does not permit me todraw parallels, though I have collected a considerable number. And as withIgnatius, so with other true saints of the Church,*2. and so also with the"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"countless magical ceremonies which have tinted the atmosphere of the West:they are all one.*1. This term must not be confounded with that applied to Theobald’s toy-shop, or tosuch jugglery as performed by Maskelyne and Colley.*2. A good example is that of Hugo de St. Victor. He made a three-fold division, thelowest being Cogitatio, the next Meditatio, and the last and highest, Contemplatio.On a similar basis Richard de St. Victor erected six stages of contemplation:1. In imaginatione secundum solam imaginationem.2. In imaginatione secundum rationem.3. In ratione secundum imaginationem.4. In ratione secundum rationem.5. Supra rationem sed non praeter rationem.6. Supra rationem videtur esse praeter rationem.Nevertheless, though at heart one, many extraneous differences do exist, andit behoves any true searcher after Truth to discover for himself thestraightest road towards his ultimate home which he long ago first left; toask help of none, to live alone, as he will have to die alone, to heed no man,to work out his own salvation, to see that his staff is stout, and that his lampburns brightly, lest he fall into that great slough of rational dung-wallowingwhich besets his path. To voyage like our father Ambrose through thunderand lightning, past the sun, and the moon, and the stars, as Crowley mostcuriously depicts in “Ambrosii Magi Hortus Rosarum,”* that mysteriouslysymbolic progress through the Tarot, the ten numbers and the twenty-twoletters.*Ambrosii Magi Hortus Rosarum, vol. ii, p. 212. I do not hesitate to add here that hadthis extraordinary Essay been written in the days of Albertus Magnus, it would now beconsidered one of the most important and curious of magical works; many religions havebeen founded on less.When along the shores of the Ægean sea a mysterious voice proclaimed:“Great Pan is dead!” Christianity was born; and like all the other greattruths, it contained a great lie: Pan was not dead, but he was snoring in thatdrunken night which cloaked the debaucheries of the classic day, and as thenight grew darker, and the dismal vapours of the middle ages rolled on,blotting out one by one the remaining stars of that past wonder which wasRome, great Pan stirred himself, and awoke. But the crystal wine of Iacchushad long since soured in the thunders of those dark days, yet, with death-palelips, he drank the blood-red wine of witchcraft. “Hark! the cock crows!Farewell till to-morrow, to-morrow night!

We willback to our old Gods again.”**The Bride of Corinth, Goethe.There is an idol in my house By whom the sandal always steams.Alone, I make a black carouse With her to dominate my dreams. With skulls and knives she keeps control (O Mother Kali!) of my soul.**Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 97.Crowley’s interpretation of Ceremonial Magic, the getting back to the oldgods, so to say, is lucidly described, under the terms of a rational system, inhis introduction to the “Goetia” of King Solomon. It is as follows:I am not concerned to deny the objective reality of all“magical” phenomena; if they are illusions, they are at least as real asmany unquestioned facts of daily life; and, if we follow HerbertSpencer, they are at least evidence of some cause.Now, this fact is our base. What is the cause of my illusion ofseeing a spirit in the triangle of Art? Every smatterer, every expert in psychology, will answer “Thatcause lies in your brain.” English children are taught (pace the Education Act) that theUniverse lies in infinite Space; Hindu children, in the Akása, which isthe same thing. Those Europeans who go a little deeper learn from Fichte, thatthe phenomenal Universe is the creation of the Ego; Hindus, orEuropeans studying under Hindu Gurus, are told, that by Akása ismeant the Chitakása. The Chitakása is situated in the “Third Eye,” i.e.,in the brain. By assuming higher dimensions of space, we canassimilate this fact to Realism; but we have no need to take so muchtrouble.This being true for the ordinary Universe, that all sense-impressions are dependent on changes in the brain, we must includeillusions, which are after all sense-impressions as much as “realities”are in the class of “phenomena dependent on brain changes.”"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Magical phenomena, however, come under a special sub-class,since they are willed, and their cause is the series of “real” phenomenacalled the operations of ceremonial Magic.. . . . . . . . . . . . .But can any of the effects described in this our book Goetia beobtained, and if so, can you give a rational explanation of thecircumstances?

Carlyle also partially grasps this idea in “Sartor Resartus” when he writes:“Witchcraft and all manner of Spectre-work, and Demonology, we have nownamed Madness, and Diseases of the Nerves. Seldom reflecting that still the new questioncomes upon us: What is Madness, what are Nerves? Ever, as before, does Madnessremain a mysterious-terrific, altogether infernal boiling-up of the Nether Chaotic Deep,through this fair-painted vision of Creation, which swims thereon, which we name theReal. Was Luther’s Picture of the Devil less a Reality, whether it were formed within thebodily eye, or without it? In every the wisest Soul lies a whole world of internal Madness,an authentic Demon-Empire; out of which, indeed, his world of Wisdom has beencreatively built together, and now rests there, as on its dark foundations does a habitableflowery Earth-rind.” —Sartor Resartus.*2.

By act, word, and thought, both inquantity and quality, the one object of the ceremony is beingconstantly indicated. Every fumigation, purification, banishing,invocation, evocation, is chiefly a reminder of a single purpose, untilthe supreme moment arrives, and every fibre of the body, every force-channel of the mind, is strained, and in one overwhelming rush of theWill in the direction desired. Such is the real purport of all theapparently fantastic directions of Solomon, Abramelin, and othersages of repute. When a man has evoked and mastered such forces asTaphtatharath, Belial, Amaimon, and the great powers of theelements, then he may safely be permitted to begin to try to stopthinking.

For ifthey firmly believe the spirit was dislodged, there can not be the slightestdoubt on this point, the spirit being a temporary part of the “brain,” as allother “ideas” must be from the idea of “constipation“ – which Seidlitzpowders will also remove – to that of Heaven and Hell,*2. whichSwedenborg also dislodges. *1.
