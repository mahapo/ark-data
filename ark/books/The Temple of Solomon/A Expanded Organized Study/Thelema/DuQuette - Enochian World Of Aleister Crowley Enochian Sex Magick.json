Hyatt, Ph.D. How do you know when you are really beginning to understand a subject? When you come to the realization that it is basically much easier than you ever imagined. For years I avoided an in-depth study of Enochian Magick, believing it to be not only too ponderous a task but also anachronistically irrelevant. I considered it a quaint dead-end of Elizabethan magic, elements of which have trickled down the centuries and lodged themselves in modem ceremonial magick. I admit that I had a certain level of curiosity and fascination, especially when I saw the painted tablets and Enochian \"chess\" equipment that Israel Regardie would display on rare occasions to his friends. But the idea of actually taking the time to make sense of this collection of complex and fragmentary material was totally intimidating. And the thought of having to learn an \"angelic language\" did not thrill me at all. I was quite happy to file Enochian Magick in the same drawer of my mind where I keep \"Secrets of Aztec Cardiology\" and \"Cooking with Barbed Wire.\" Then several years ago I was pleasantly disabused. I had asked Crowley expert, Lon DuQuette, to write an epilogue for my book. Secrets of Western Tantra, (Falcon Press, 1989) and in the course of our discussion he asked me if I had ever utilized Enochian Angels for operations of Sex Magick. He was genuinely amused when I revealed my reasons for avoiding the subject and he suggested that if ever I wished to learn how to immediately perform Enochian Magick, I should simply read Crowley's Liber Chanokh and get started. 13"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley When I protested that I had read it, that in fact, it was included in Gems From The Equinox, (Falcon Press, 1982). He said, \"then read it again, carefully, and this time assume that everything you need to know is right there in the text.\" He continued. \"It is much simpler than you think.\" He then encouraged me to call him if I ran into trouble. His somewhat cavalier attitude was oddly reassuring, so I took some time that evening to reread Chanokh. I followed his advice and pretended it was the only book on the subject in the world. To my great surprise I discovered that everything seemed quite clear. Was this the same book that frustrated and confused me earlier? Did I all of a sudden become so much smarter? Questions that were raised by one sentence were answered in the next. The fundamentals of the system unfolded neatly before my eyes. In less than an hour, I felt perfectly competent to start basic operations. I had no reason to call Lon for advice. When I did call him it was to tell him of my application of the system to elements of my Tantric practices and that I wished to publish Chanokh along with his comments and supplementary material of my own findings. I have enjoyed our collaboration very much for his enthusiasm for the subject has been irresistibly contagious. Now we invite you to enter The Enochian World Of Aleister Crowley. Relax. It is much simpler than you think and I guarantee you that if you do embark upon the sexual practices all of your efforts will be well rewarded. 14"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Introduction By Lon Milo DuQuette In the introduction of a recently published book on magick, the writer characterizes the Enochian material in Crowley's Equinox as being \"scanty\" and in \"disarray\". I am afraid I could not disagree more. In fact, it is so exquisitely comprehensive and laid out with such orderly neatness that, (to quote Masonic scholar, Gary Ford), \"Crowley can only be criticized for being too anal retentive.\" If the critic was capable of paying attention and spent the hour or less that it takes to read Chanokh she couldn't help but grasp the subject. This, in my opinion, cannot be said of any other text on the subject. For example, the somewhat complex explanation of how the 18 Calls are ordered and combined for invocations of the 16 different subangles takes four pages in Regardie's Complete Golden Dawn System Of Magic, (Falcon Press, 1984). Crowley does it easily in 10 sentences. I will not argue that Crowley demands much from his readers. But in the case of Liber LXXXIV vel Chanokh the difficulty is that one finds it almost impossible to believe that so much is communicated in so few words. The genuineness of these Keys, altogether apart from any critical observation, is guaranteed by the fact that anyone with the smallest capacity for Magick finds that they work. Aleister Crowley Twenty five years ago few members of the general occult community had ever heard of the 15"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley Enochian system of Magick. Those who were aware of its existence fell into two main categories: I. Members of the surviving magical societies which operated in the basic traditions of Ordo Templi Orientis, A.'. A.'. or The Golden Dawn. II. Individuals lucky enough to posses either of two long-out-of-print works: The Equinox Volume I, Numbers 7 & 8 The Golden Dawn Volumes 1-4 The Equinox, Aleister Crowley's Magnum Opus, issued at six month intervals between 1909 and 1914, was the first modern publication to examine the Enochian system in the seventh and eighth books of the ten number series. Israel Regardie's Account Of The Teachings, Rites And Ceremonies Of The Golden Dawn followed in four volumes, the first published in 1937 and the fourth in 1940. Though material relating directly to Enochiana occupies only a fraction of the above texts, the quality of the material is unquestioned. Both provide clear, fundamental information that gives the student both a basic understanding of the system and all the tools necessary to begin to immediately apply it and operate Enochian Magick. In 1969 Regardie's Golden Dawn was reissued in a two volume format and then in 1974 he edited and released Gems From The Equinox containing all the Enochian material from the original 10 volume set. Both works are still in print. The Complete Golden Dawn System Of Magic, (Falcon Press, 1984) Regardie's tour de force published shortly before his death, includes his invaluable. Addendum to the Concourse of Forces. This tome stands as a monument to both the man and the material. This time the Enochian Genii has stayed out of the bottle. 16"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick Since 1969 an increasing number of students have turned their attention to this attractive yet, at first glance, overwhelmingly complex system. Their diligence is rewarded with something very rare indeed—a magical system that really works! This takes many arm-chair magicians entirely off guard. A legitimate encounter with an Elemental Spirit or an Angel of an Æthyr invariably leaves a more lasting impression on the magician than the phantoms of self-deluded wishful thinking that mark the \"successful working\" of the dilettante. Today Enochiana commands a respectable amount of space on the shelves of your local occult or New-Age bookstore. Much of the original Dee material (still existent) has been reprinted and made available to an ever-growing body of readers. The students of the early 1970s have become the researchers and prolific authors of today. Many of the new works are excellent and offer invaluable contributions to the ever-increasing library of Enochian knowledge. (The works of Robert Turner should be singled out for their insight and high level of scholarship.) Some others I feel are of less value. While perhaps informative as examples of the \"findings\" of one magician's experimentation, the distinction is not always made clear as to what is the author's speculation and innovation and what actually are the procedures suggested in the original documents. Then, to make matters even more confusing, the author presumes to define to the reader what they can expect to experience, intimating that if they get anything else they are somehow in error. In my opinion, these works are little more than guided meditations upon another magician's visions and deny the reader the challenge of self discovery and mastery. But I'm sure that new volumes such as these 17"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"will continue to appear.

This coupled with Regardie's fine Enochian Dictionary and pronunciation guide provides the reader with the minimum material necessary to get started. For the advanced student we offer practical instructions concerning powerful sexual applications of the system and the opportunity to re-evaluate the original information that the greatest magician of 20th Century felt was most necessary to master first. 18"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Chapter One.

While this is a grossly inaccurate oversimplification, (Dr. Rudd, Elias Ashmole, Wynn Westcott and Israel Regardie might at least be called midwives), it is basically true. Through the efforts of the unbelievably mercurial Elizabethan mathematician. Dr. John Dee and his equally unbelievable \"psychic\" partner, Edward Kelly, the raw material for the Enochian System was \"dictated\" through a series of Angelic communications that lasted from 1582 to 1589. Copious records were kept, many which have survived to the present.

Mainly due to his inspired scholarship and impeccable logic. Dee's and Kelly's \"raw\" material was hammered into a comprehensive and workable system of ceremonial Magick. The two major branches of the system were then grafted to the Adeptus Minor curriculum of the Golden Dawn. Aleister Crowley, who joined the Golden Dawn in 1898 and attained the Grade of Adeptus Minor in 1900, was of course exposed to the Order's Enochian teachings. However, Crowley took the Enochian \"ball\" and ran with it farther than the founders of the Golden Dawn had ever dreamed possible. His exploration of the 30 Æthyrs as chronicled in The Vision And The Voice (Gems From The Equinox, Falcon Press 1982) has been seriously compared to the visionary works of William Blake and the Qabalistic images of Ezekiel and the Revelation of Saint John the Divine. It was also Aleister Crowley who reorganized and elucidated upon the Golden Dawn Enochian material and published it in Equinox Vol. I, Nos.

Christopher S.

David P. Wilson Resign yourself at the outset to take responsibility for your own magical reality. When you have firmly assumed this responsibility you will realize that there is no Enochian universe per se. There is only your universe which you can access by the Enochian formulae. There is no Enochian magick per se. There is only your magick, facilitated by the methods of the Enochian system. This is not to argue the concept of spirits and angels having a certain objective reality. Indeed, the fundamental operating principal of evocation is to give outward substance to inner realities. But the sooner you rid yourself of preconceived ideas of how all this is going to manifest the sooner you will be able to recognize it when it really does start to manifest. For example, let us compare the Enochian system of Dr. Dee to a more familiar \"system\" of another Elizabethan genius. The sensitive theater-goer reaps a rich harvest of intellectual and spiritual rewards whenever he or she sees a play by William Shakespeare. 21"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley Each character in the play, hero or villain, speaks the \"truth\" from their particular perspective and it is up to us as the audience, to analyze these \"truths\" and apply them toward understanding our own lives.

These \"truths\" would be the same \"truths\" if the actors were dressed traditionally, or as cowboys or as space aliens. Granted, you might be distracted and miss the point of Hamlet's soliloquy if it were delivered by a giant amoeba, but a Biologist might find it most profound. Just as no two people see and react to a play in exactly the same way, so too, no two magicians will have identical experiences in evocation.

In fact you are encouraged to do so. By following the suggestions in the section that follows you will avoid many time-consuming mistakes that have traditionally plagued the Enochian student. Supplementary to the text of Chanokh, I have provided comments to each of the major sections and have added additional diagrams in the Appendix.

The first is: The Elemental Watch-Towers Of The Universe And The Tablet of Union These are the Elemental Tablets (Plates III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII) which are constructed with the purest Hermetic logic and lettered according to the diagrams of Dee and Kelly. These letters form the names of the Spirits of Fire, Water, Air and Earth. These are the \"Elementals\" of literature, the Salamanders of Fire, the Undines of Water, the Sylphs of Air and the Gnomes of Earth. Exactly what are the Elements and, more importantly, why would anyone want to call up an Elemental Being? Below is a portion of our book The Ultimate Divination (New Falcon Publications, 1991) which touches upon the subject of the Elements. The ancients viewed the Elements as the building blocks of creation. They divided them into four broad categories which they called FIRE, WATER, AIR and EARTH. Of course these are not the chemical elements which combine to form the material world around us. Nor are they literally Fire, Water, Air and Earth. They are, most simply put, the totality of all the forces, energies and qualities in the universe divided info four broad categories. These categories, by their natures, bear a poetical resemblance to Fire, Water, Air and Earth. These qualities are the 25"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley foundation of both galaxies and sub-atomic particles and the limitless diversity of creation is the result of the infinite number of ways these four Elements can be mixed, combined and recombined. It is interesting to note that modern physics postulates four fundamental forces; the Strong Force, the Electro-Magnetic Force, the Weak Force and the Gravitational Force that, by their characteristics, bear a remarkable resemblance to the ancient Elements: The ancients also postulated a Fifth Element (quite literally a \"quintessence\") which serves the double duty of binding the four Elements together and (at the same time) keeping them far enough apart to retain their individuality. This Fifth Element they called SPIRIT. Once you have colored your Tablets you will see how the \"Angels\" of any given Element are formed, combined, mixed, recombined and reformed. (Note: Completed Colored Tablets are currently available through New Falcon Publications.) Obviously these Elementals are more than just the Salamanders in your fireplace, the sailor's Mermaid, Tinkerbell or Gimli the Dwarf. They have far more universal natures and as such are worthy of our attention. As a matter of fact they are at work, either efficiently or inefficiently, in each of us. Perhaps if we had a better understanding of our Elemental balance (or lack of it) we might get a clue as to how to improve our lives. Note: What follows may seem a bit complicated to the new student. A full explanation of the operating procedure will be given in the following chapters. For example, some years ago I accepted a job from an old friend who asked me to edit a psychology book he had just completed.

I drew it on a piece of scratch paper and after the obligatory banishing I gazed upon it for a few minutes then went to bed. The next morning I decided I would take the figure SOAIZNT gave me and simply draw it at the top of each page of my daily note pad where I would be forced to look at it almost continually. Throughout the course of the project (which went surprisingly well by the way) I was focused upon this symbol and constantly reminded of the invocation and the incredible vision of the Angel who aids works of this nature. In practical workings such as this it is very helpful to bring something from the vision back into this world. In the everyday world of our waking consciousness life forms, such as people, animals, plants, etc., we perceive as living \"beings.\" On the other hand, symbols such as triangles, pentagrams, letters, etc., we perceive as abstractions, springboards to a variety of ideas. In the \"magical\" world it is just the opposite. When we \"see\" a life form, such as an Angel or a unicorn or an aardvark, it is an abstract personification of an idea. Symbols, on the other hand, are \"living beings\" on that plane, the true life forms of the magical universe. As you can imagine these symbol-life forms can be powerful tools in the hands of the magician. Bringing them through to our objective world is an important part of practical workings. The second pillar is: 28"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick The Thirty Æthyrs Whose Dominion Extendeth In Ever-Widening Circles Beyond The Watch-Towers Of The Universe These are the \"heavens\" or Aires of the system. Starting with the 30th Æthyr and working to the 1st, the magician explores only as far as his or her personal level of Initiation will permit. This process is comparable to \"pathworkings\" of the Qabalistic system. In Enochian terms, the \"Great Work\" of the magician is to master all 30 Æthyrs. (Starting with 30 and ending with 1) Experiences with the 30 Æthyrs are highly personal and entirely unique to each magician. Working with the Æthyrs can be a lifetime endeavor and it is entirely presumptuous and inappropriate for another individual to \"guide\" another in this area. Thus, with these two branches of the system, the Elemental and the Æthyric, we have formulae to access both the phenomenal world of the Elements and private world of our own Spiritual Journey. Both types of operations require the ability on the part of the magician to skry or \"travel in the Spirit Vision.\" If you are not already a talented skryer there is no better way to train than Enochian Magick, especially elemental workings. There are as many skrying techniques as there are magicians who skry. Dee and Kelly gazed into a concave obsidian mirror. Crowley held a large topaz mounted upon a wooden cross to his forehead. But other methods include gazing into crystals, ink, fire eleven a blank TV screen. You can sit in a chair or on the floor or lie on your back. You can close your eyes or keep them open.

I was amused to hear one skryer's abilities criticized for being done in a \"light trance\" state. We should all be so lucky! For anyone who has tried unsuccessfully to skry in the past I offer the following hint. Stop trying to skry! Don't try to \"see\" a vision in your mind. The vision is already going on in the part of your mind (the right side of your brain) where you are not currently focused. (Don't criticize the movie if you go to the theater, buy a ticket then choose to stay in the lobby.) When you refocus your attention to that part of your mind you will find the \"vision\" in progress. It's impossible to refocus while you are consciously trying to refocus. So stop trying. Relax. This change of focus happens each time you drop off to sleep. There is a moment when your thoughts begin to take visual form. You have a choice for a brief moment of \"snapping out of it\" or relaxing and \"going with it, allowing yourself to change your focus for the rest of the night. When you skry you are not asleep but neither are you focused on the objective world as analyzed by the left side of your brain. You relax and allow yourself to focus on the subjective, visual world of your brain's right hemisphere. The most important thing to remember is not to project an objective reality to another skryer's vision. This is the flaw of \"guided Pathworkings\" or meditations upon another magician's visions. It is your magical universe you are dealing with and no one else's.

LXXXIV (84) is the Qabalistic numeration for Chanokh, the Hebrew spelling of Enoch. Note: When originally published the title did not bear the number. Crowley assigned the number 84 when the Syllabus of the Official Instructions of A.'. A.'. was published in The Blue Equinox. Since then, due to a series of typographical errors, the number LXXXIX (89) has been mistakenly used in the title of published works. For our purposes we will refer to it simply as Chanokh. PART I THE HOLY TWELVEFOLD TABLE The Holy Table is part of the \"furniture\" of the Temple and does not directly concern Elemental or Æthyrical workings. Angels found on the Holy Table are not called forth in these operations. The original table top measured 35 7/8in X 36 l/4in X 7/lOin.

It is now believed that, do to a 17th Century printer's error, Casaubon's version (and consequently everybody's since) was printed with the letters in reverse order. One of Dee's descriptions of the Table indicates it resembled the illustration we have included in the Appendix (Diagram A) of this book. This is regarded as the correct version. (Note: The Plates referred to are not in the Appendix but in the text of Chanokh itself [Chapter Five of this book]. All of the diagrams are in the Appendix of this book and are not original Chanokh illustrations.) THE SEVEN TALISMANS Like the Holy Table, these are considered Temple \"furniture\" and do not directly concern Elemental or Æthyrical workings. Spirits found on these talismans are not called forth in these operations. The illustrations in Plate I are too small to read. Enlargements from the 17th Century manuscript. Dr. Rudd's Treatise, are included in the Appendix (Diagram B) of this book. It is interesting to note that the names on these \"planetary\" talismans are those of the Goetia. This indicates (or at least implies) Dee's familiarity with the LEMEGETON and his attempt, at least early in his workings, to incorporate it in the Enochian system. PART II THE HOLY SEVENFOLD TABLE THE SIGILLUM DEI ÆMETH Perhaps the most widely recognized diagram of the Enochian system, the Sigillum Dei Æmeth does not directly concern Elemental or Æthyrical workings. Like the Holy Table and the Talismans, its Angels are not called forth in these operations.

Note: The illustration on Plate II was taken from Dee's diaries. The large wax version on display at the British Museum is slightly different. For example on the actual wax version, there are 7 crosses on each of the 7 bars making up the main heptagram. The illustration shows only three bars with 7 crosses the other 4 containing only 3. Even though the above items of temple furniture are unnecessary for Elemental operations and for exploring the 30 Æthyrs, the reader might like to make his or her own versions of them to support the skrying mirror.

The Hierarchy of the Fire, Air, and Earth Tablets are determined in exactly the same way. 34"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick Note: To make this section easier to understand, I have included in the Appendix (Diagram D) an English version of the Water Tablet conveniently split apart for easy viewing. If you keep this diagram in front of you while reading Part III of Chanokh I think you will have no trouble understanding what is being said. BASIC TERMS The Four Great Watch-Towers are often referred to as the Elemental Tablets of Air, Water, Earth and Fire. Plate III shows them together; Air in the upper left-hand quarter, Water in the upper-right hand quarter, Earth in the lower left-hand quarter and Fire in the lower right-hand quarter. Plates IV, V, VI, & VII show them singularly. Each of the Elemental Tablets is also divided into four sections by the two central vertical columns and the central horizontal line. (The Linea Patris, the Linea Filii and the Linea Spiritus Sancti respectively) This is also referred to as the Great Central Cross of the Elemental Tablet. (See Diagram D). The four sections of the Elemental Tablet created by the Great Central Cross are called Subangles which are also attributed to the four Elements. (Air in the upper left-hand quarter, Water in the upper-right hand quarter. Earth in the lower left-hand quarter and Fire in the lower right-hand quarter. In Diagram D in the Appendix of this book, you will see an example of the Water Tablet divided by the Great Central Cross and broken into its Subangles. (Air of Water in the upper left, Water of Water in the upper right. Earth of Water in the lower left, and Fire of Water in the lower right) Subangles on the Air, Fire and Earth Tablets are arranged in exactly the same way. 35"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley 1. THE THREE HOLY NAMES OF GOD (See Diagram D) The Three Holy Names of God are made up of the first three letters, the next four letters and the last five letters of the Linea Spirtus Sancti (the central horizontal line of each Elemental Tablet) For our example, the Water Tablet, the Three Holy Names are: MPH ARSL GAIOL. Note: Don't let these names intimidate you. Just locate them. Don't worry about pronouncing them now. There is an excellent pronunciation guide provided later in this book. Now try to locate The Three Holy Names on the Fire, Air and Earth Tablets. 2. THE GREAT ELEMENTAL KING (See Diagram D) The eight letter Name of the Great Elemental King is formed by a clockwise whorl around the center of The Great Central Cross of the Linea Patris, the Linea Filii and the Linea Spirtus Sancti. The Great Elemental King may be considered the Sun Senior of the Tablet. The Great Elemental King of the Water Tablet is RAAGIOSL. Now try to locate the Great Elemental Kings on the other three Elemental Tablets. 3. THE SIX SENIORS (See Diagram D) The 7 letter Names of the Six Planetary Seniors are also drawn from the Great Central Cross. Each Name starts in the middle of the Cross and moves towards the extremities. (Arrows in Diagram D show the directions the names are read and the Planet to which each of the Seniors is attributed). This is the same for all four Elemental Tablets. In the case of the Water Tablet; SAIINOV is the Senior of Jupiter, SOAIZNT is the Senior of Mercury, LAOAZRP is the Senior of the Moon, 36"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick LIGDISA is the Senior of Saturn, SLGAIOL is the Senior of of Venus and LSRAHPM is the Senior of Mars. Now locate the Six Seniors on the three other Elemental Tablets. 4. THE CALVARY CROSSES (See Diagram D) Each of the four Subangles on an Elemental Tablet contains a Calvary Cross. The two Angels of the Calvary Cross rule the Subangle. With the first Name (the vertical line — reading from top to bottom) you call forth the Power of the Subangle. With the second Name (the horizontal line— reading from left to right) you compel the Power to obedience. (We will see how to do this later) These names as they apply to the Water Tablet appear in the text of Chanokh. Remember, there are four Calvary Crosses in each Elemental Tablet. Now locate the four Calvary Crosses in the subangles of each of the four Elemental Tablets. 5. THE KERUBIM (See Diagram D) The four letter Name of the Kerub is found above the arms of the Calvary Cross of each subangle. The letters of the Cross itself are never included in the Kerub's name. The Kerub rules the angels who reside below the arms of the Cross. The four letters in the name of the Kerub can be rearranged in different orders to create different Kerubs who in turn rule different angels beneath the arms of the cross. (The letters of their names rearranged exactly as those of the rearranged Kerub.) Note: A great deal of confusion exists concerning this statement in Chanokh: They are ruled by names of God formed by prefixing the appropriate letter from the 'black cross' to their own [the Kerubim] names... There is disagreement among scholars as to which letters from 37"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley the \"Black Cross\" (the Tablet of Union) are \"appropriate.\" If you refer to Diagram G you will see that 16 of the 20 squares correspond to the 16 subangles of the four Elemental tablets. The most popular theory maintains that these are the appropriate letters to help form the name of the \"God\" that rules the Kerub of any given Subangle. Let us use the example of the Elemental Tablet of Water (Diagram D) the Kerub of the Subangle of Fire is NLRX. Now refer to Diagram G and find the Fire of Water square. It is the fifth square of the second line. \"A\" (The \"A\" in HCOMA). So the God that rules NLRX would be ANLRX. Please remember that there is disagreement, even among very knowledgeable experts, about these \"God\" names and where exactly they fit in the Enochian Hierarchy. I advise beginning students to first become adequately fluent in basic hierarchical workings then develop for themselves a structure for these \"supercharged\" angels. The system does not pivot on this point. 6. THE FOUR MIGHTY AND BENEVOLENT ANGELS (See Diagram D) These Angels are found beneath the horizontal bar of the Calvary Cross and are last in the Hierarchy of the Elemental Angels. They are extremely interesting and can provide great insight into the nature of the Elements. (Again, the names are only of four letters). Note: Remember these four Angels are ruled by their Kerub who is found above the horizontal arm of the Calvary Cross. When you make a different Kerub (by changing the order of the letters in its name) you automatically make four new sets of Angel names beneath the arm of the Calvary Cross (by changing the 38"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick order of the letters of their names in the same manner as the new Kerub.) 7. THE DEMONS OR ELEMENTALS (See Diagram D) Unfortunately the definitive instructions promised by Crowley were not forthcoming and experts and students alike are left to speculate and disagree. The reader is encouraged to join in this quest. It is clear that they are not routinely called forth in workings of the Elemental Tablets. [Following Crowley's comments on the Triliteral names of demons (above) he begins a second section of PART III with subheadings 1-5.] PART III (SECOND SECTION) As you can see from Plates IV, V, VI, VII and VIII, the Squares of the Elemental Tablets and the Tablet of Union are really Pyramids with flat tops. The Pyramid with its four sides and top is an especially appropriate symbol for the Four Elements ruled by Spirit. Each side of an Enochian Pyramid has a very specific attribute. There are 20 Pyramids in the Tablet of Union and 156 in each of the four Elemental tablets. Each Pyramid houses an Angel with a one letter name. The attributes of that Angel are determined by the positioning of the Pyramid upon the Tablet and proportions of the different Elements represented on its four sides. When two Pyramids are combined they form an Angel with a two letter name whose attributes are a bit more complex. And so on. To most easily understand how these attributes are determined I will give the reader the most valuable hint of all: 39"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley HINT # 4. HAND COLOR PLATES IV. V, VI. VII, & VIII Before attempting to understand the second section of Part III, you are well advised to make photocopies of Plates IV, V, VI, VII & VIII and then hand color the Pyramids. By coloring the Pyramids you will learn, in the fastest and easiest way possible, the logic behind their construction. THE COLORING KEY FOR EACH PYRAMID Leave the center square of each Pyramid (which contains the letter) uncolored for the time being. Sides with the Spirit  White Symbol     Sides with the Fire Symbol Sides with the Water Symbol Sides with the Air Symbol Sides with the Earth Symbol Red Blue Yellow Green or Black I suggest you start with the Tablet Of Union, (Plate VIII or the English lettered version in the Appendix, Diagram G). Even though it is small, it is a very important Tablet for its Angels, EXARP, HCOMA, NANTA & BITOM, rule the other four Elemental Tablets, (EXARP rules the Air Tablet, HCOMA rules the Water Tablet, NANTA rules the Earth Tablet and BITOM rules the Fire Tablet.) The Tablet Of Union is considered the Elemental Tablet of Spirit. The four Elements are represented in 40"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick their purest form, undifferentiated by the level of admixture that characterizes the other four Elemental Tablets. The Tablet Of Union acts in exactly the same manner as Spirit acts upon the four Elements. It binds them together so they can combine to be the building blocks of creation yet keeps them separated just enough to prevent the loss of their individual and fundamental natures. This active and passive quality of Spirit is the reason that there are two types of Spirit Pentagrams, Active and Passive. The Angels of the Tablet Of Union can be said to be the very \"roots\" of the Angels of the Elemental Tablets. Once you have colored your Tablet Of Union, you will discover that a very simple pattern is formed by the attributes in the Lines and Files (or Columns). The top and bottom section of each Pyramid is attributed to Spirit. The right side is attributed to the Primary Element (as dictated by which Line the Pyramid is located) and the left side is attributed to the Secondary Element (as dictated by which Column it is located). Note; This and what follows below will be laughably easy to understand if you have taken five minutes and colored your Tablet Of Union. THE LINES The four five letter Names (EXARP, HCOMA, NANTA and BITOM) are the Primary Spirits of the Elements. Each Spirit governs an entire Elemental Tablet. EXARP is the Spirit of Air and governs the entire Air Tablet. The right section of each Pyramid of EXARP is Air. 41"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley HCOMA is the Spirit of Water and governs the entire Water Tablet.

BITOM is the Spirit of Fire and governs the entire Fire Tablet. The right section of each Pyramid of BITOM is Fire. THE COLUMNS This same order of Air, Water, Earth and Fire is repeated in the Columns of the Tablet Of Union as Secondary attributions which appear on the left section of each Pyramid. (See Diagram G) The first Column, EHNB is the purest of all the Column Names. Each letter rules its respective Line and is three parts Spirit and one part its respective Element. E governs EXARP H governs HCOMA N governs NANTA B governs BITOM. The sixteen letters of the remaining four columns contain both Primary and Secondary attributions. (Remember, the Secondary attribution is located upon the left section of these Pyramids.) These sixteen letters govern the sixteen Subangles of the Elemental Tablets.

Take the letter E from EXARP and put it under your microscope. You will see the entire Air Elemental Tablet. Take the letter O from BITOM and put it under your microscope. You will see the Earth Subangle of the Tablet of Fire. Take the second letter N from NANTA and put it under your microscope. Your will see the Water Subangle of the Earth Tablet, etc. After you have colored your Tablet Of Union color each of the four Elemental Tablets. (You may purchase all of these beautifully mounted on boards from New Falcon Publications.) HINT #5 COLOR EACH ELEMENTAL TABLET IN FOUR STEPS Note: There are various ways the Pyramids of the Great Central Cross may be colored. We have chosen the method below because the attributes are uniformly determined through Elemental rulerships. STEP 1: THE GREAT CENTRAL CROSS The Top section of each Pyramid of the Great Central Cross represents Spirit and is painted White. The Bottom section of each Pyramid of the Great Central Cross represents the Element of the Tablet. In 43"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley the case of the Water Tablet it is painted Blue. (When painting the Fire Tablet the bottom sections of the Great Central Cross would be Red, the Air Tablet Yellow, the Earth Tablet, Green or Black) The Left side of each Pyramid of the Great Central Cross represent the Signs of the Zodiac. These are grouped in threes by element and positioned as describe in Chanokh. The Fire Signs (Aires, Leo and Sagittarius) are colored Red. The Water Signs (Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces) are colored Blue. The Air Signs (Libra, Aquarius and Gemini) are colored Yellow. The Earth Signs (Capricorn, Taurus and Virgo) are colored Green (or Black) The Right side of each Pyramid of the Great Central Cross represent the planetary rulership of the 36 decans of the Zodiac. There are 36 decans and 36 Pyramids in the Great Central Cross. For our purpose we color the planets according to the rulership of the fixed signs: Saturn and Mercury for Air are colored Yellow Jupiter and the Sun for Fire are colored Red Venus and the Moon for Earth are colored Green or (Black) Mars for Water is colored Blue. STEP 2: THE CALVARY CROSSES The Top section of each Pyramid of the Calvary Crosses of the subangles represents Spirit and is painted white. The Bottom section of each Pyramid of the Calvary Crosses of the subangles represent one of the ten Sephiroth of the Qabalistic Tree of Life and are 44"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick numbered according to Plates IV, V, VI and VII. We suggest for the time being, that you leave the Bottom sections White and simply number them in black. Later you may wish to paint them one of the four traditional colors of the Sephiroth. The Left section of each Pyramid of the Calvary Crosses of the subangles represent the Element of the Tablet. In the case of the Water Tablet, the Left section of the Pyramids of each of the four Calvary Crosses would be painted Blue. The Right section of each Pyramid of the Calvary Crosses of the subangles represent the Element of the subangle itself and painted accordingly. [Upper Left-hand subangle (Air-Yellow), Upper Right-hand subangle (Water-Blue), Lower Left-hand subangle (Earth-Green or Black), Lower Right-hand Subangle, (Fire-Red)] This pattern is the same for all four Elemental Tablets. STEP 3: THE KERUBIC ANGELS These are found above the arms of the Calvary Crosses. The Top section of each of the four Kerubic Pyramids represent the Elemental Tablet and are colored accordingly. In the case of the Water Tablet, blue. The Bottom section of each of the four Kerubic Pyramids represent the Element of the subangle itself and is colored accordingly. Color the Right and Left sections of each of the four Kerubic Pyramids as indicated in Plates IV, V, VI and VII. The order that the elements are arranged follow a logical permutation and dictate the order of the Lines and Columns of the 16 Lesser Pyramids found below the arms of the Calvary Cross. 45"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley STEP 4: THE SIXTEEN LESSER PYRAMIDS These are found below the arms of the Calvary Crosses. The Left section of each Pyramid of the Lesser Angels represents the Elemental Tablet. In the case of the Water Tablet it is colored Blue. The Right section of each Pyramid of the Lesser Angels represents the subangle and is colored accordingly. Color the Top and Bottom section of each of the sixteen Lesser Pyramids as indicated in Plates IV, V, VI. and VII. Notice how the coloring order is dictated by the squares of the Kerubic Angels. Granted, all this may take a few hours to execute but it will save you months (or as in my case, years) of confusion. Now with your colored Tablets before you, read the material in the Second section of Part III of Chanokh and marvel at the \"method\" to the \"madness.\" PART IV THE ENOCHIAN ALPHABET AND THE ENOCHIAN LANGUAGE One of the most unique characteristics of Enochian Magick is that the invocations are recited in a language completely unique to the system. This language comes down to us as the result of the workings of Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelly and, according to their records, was taught to them by the Enochian Angels themselves. Israel Regardie in his massive work. The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic (New Falcon Publications, 1984), makes the following comments: 46"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Enochian. Sex Magick The Enochian language is without any history prior to the skrying of Edward Kelly and John Dee. There is no record of its prior existence, regardless of some fanciful theories which have been invented to account for it. The Enochian language is not just a haphazard combination and compilation of divine and angelic names drawn from the Tablets. Apparently, it is a true language with a grammar and syntax of its own. Only a superficial study of the invocations suffice to indicate this to be a fact. The invocations are not strings of words and barbarous names, but are sentences which can be translated in a meaningful way and not merely transliterated. I believe, when invoking, that it is of the utmost importance to recite the Call or Calls in Enochian and not use an English translation. Not that it is unimportant for the Magician to know exactly what is being said but it is obvious to me that the intelligences who delivered this language to Dee and Kelly did not do it to hear themselves talk. Reciting in Enochian instantly changes one's consciousness and induces a state of mind conducive to magical working. The Calls themselves are very unique and are nothing like the tedious beseechments and endless whining and self debasement that characterize Goetic evocations. Rather, in the Angel's native tongue, they sing of its attributes and environment and offer a dignified invitation to communicate with the Magician. This format is irresistible to the Angel. Think about it. If a mouse crawled up on your shoe and started to squeak, you would only give it as much attention as you would need to chase it away. But if it crawled up on your shoe, called you by name and then began to recite, in English, a litany of recognizable personal traits: ... Oh thou who art so huge, who wakest with the music of the clock-radio and who bringest 47"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley in the morning paper, who with thy mouth consumest the eggs of the hen and wipeth thy lips with paper... ... you would sit up and take notice. You might even try to have a meaningful conversation with the little fellow. You wouldn't even mind if he spoke with a thick accent! The Enochian Calls as they appear in Chanokh are written phonetically and are very close to the standard used by the Golden Dawn which appear in Regardie's Enochian Dictionary in the Appendix of this book. Plate DC shows the Enochian Alphabet and Plates I, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII are lettered in Enochian. PART V THE THIRTY ÆTHYRS OR AIRES As we will read in Chanokh, Crowley says that Dee: ...symbolized the Fourth-Dimensional Universe in two dimensions as a square surrounded by 30 concentric circles (the 30 Æthyrs or Aires) whose radii increase in a geometrical proportion The \"square\" mentioned above is the Four Elemental Tablets and the Tablet of Union. These are quite literally Watch-Towers that stand at the very edge of the phenomenal universe. Beyond the Watch-Towers are the Æthyrs, the Aires, the Heavens. They can be visualized as thirty spheres, one inside another like layers of a glass onion. The Thirtieth, TEX is the lowest and consequently the closest to the Watch-Towers. LIL, the First, is the highest and represents the Supreme Attainment. It is the Great work of the Magician to \"explore\" the Æthyrs one at a time, and learn the lessons, master the problems and receive the wisdom each has to offer. 48"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick Most anyone who cares to try has some level of success in the lower Æthyrs. It is most important to keep a detailed record of all workings because eventually you will reach a point beyond which you cannot pass. This point marks the limits of your present level of \"initiation\" and the last Æthyr you could successfully penetrate holds the key to your spiritual advancement. Each of the Thirty Æthyrs is populated by Governors whose responsibilities are partially described in Dee's Liber Scientiæ, Auxilii, et Victoriæ Terrestris. For our purpose we will view the Governors as angelic personifications of the different facets of the Æthyrs. They serve as our guides and most importantly they are \"someone\" to whom we can talk and ask questions. The names of the each of the Thirty Æthyrs and their Governors is provided in the text of Chanokh. Each Æthyr has three Governors (except the Thirtieth which has four). Sigils (signatures) of the Governors are taken from the Elemental Tablets showing that the influence of the Æthyrs is universal reaching even into the Watch-Towers of the Elements. These sigils of the Governors are illustrated in Plate X and more clearly in Diagram F and are numbered 1 through 91. In order to more easily find the Sigil of each Governor, the reader is encouraged to number the list of Governors as found in Part V of Chanokh starting with OCCODON-1, PASCOMB-2, VALGARS-3, DOAGNIS-4, etc. Ironically very little effort is required to \"work\" with the Æthyrs. One Call only is necessary for all thirty of them. The name of the Æthyr itself being the only variable. Once the Call is recited the names of the Governors are vibrated one at a time. Often the vision 49"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley changes drastically when the next Governor's name is vibrated. Take your time with each one and, as always, keep a detailed record of your operation. Now let us turn our attention to the section of Chanokh designated in the text as: PART II THE FORTY-EIGHT CALLS OR KEYS The calls or Keys activate the tablets and subangles in the same way as the power switch turns on a TV before selecting a channel. At the beginning of this section Crowley tells us which Calls are used in all the various invocations of the Elemental system. He does so in the fewest words humanly possible. Perhaps the reader will appreciate the elucidation below. FIRST KEY Use first in all invocations of any of the Angels of the Tablet of Union. (It is not used in the invocation of any of the Angels of the Elemental Tablets.) SECOND KEY Use second as invocation of the Angels of the letters E H N B of the Tablet of Union. Like the FIRST CALL it is never used in the invocation of the Angels of the four Elemental Tablets. (The sequence of Calls being 1 and 2.) Note: The Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Keys are used in certain invocations of the Tablet of Union and in the Invocations of the Elemental Tablets. What follows immediately is how they are used in invocations of the Tablet of Union.

THE CALL OR KEY OF THE THIRTY ÆTHYRS As we have mentioned above, the Nineteenth Call, or Key of the Thirty Æthyrs, is the only call necessary for workings with the Æthyrs. It is only necessary to change the name of the Æthyr itself near the beginning of the Call. Note: In a footnote in Chanokh, Crowley mentions a second name in the Call that \"...may appropriately be varied with the Aire\". Try as I may to discover a logical correlation between LIL (the Æthyr in question) and IDOIGO (the footnoted name in question), I cannot. Until I do, I will continue to vary the Call of the Thirty Æthyrs only with the name of the Æthyr itself. If I am wrong I am willing to be forgiven. 53 "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley MINIMUM RECOMMENDED OPERATING PROCEDURES The question now arises \"How do I go about implementing the above information to invoke the Angels of the Elemental Tablets or begin my exploration of the Æthyrs?\" The nature of the original Dee material is such as to make exact and definitive operating procedures unclear. In other books of Enochian Magick, particularly those written in the last 10 years, you will find elaborate instructions that differ considerably from what is suggested below. As you become more familiar with the system you will develop your own sense of what is logical and appropriate. It is very important during the period of your learning curve to stay focused on source material such as Chanokh. Chanokh provides basic operating instructions, though not always clearly. It is obvious that Crowley assumed the reader would have a basic magical education and would be able to proceed somewhat on their own understanding. These comments and the supplementary material in the Appendix are intended to help on both these fronts. But we should not ignore the obvious fact that Crowley's original presentation was very short and straightforward. Nowhere does he even hint that the Magician must engage in a long series of beseechments, coercions and just plain magical whinings that characterize other branches of magick. What is unique about Enochian Magick is the absence of such infantile nonsense. Calls are addressed in the language of the beings involved. There is a simple hierarchy that needs to be recognized. The rest is between you and the Angels. 54"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick To make matters even simpler he provides us with five flawlessly constructed \"Temple Openings\" which are inserted prior to the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Keys.

If you are unclear as to the appropriate signs, pentagrams or hexagrams used in the Temple Openings refer to the Appendix. The simple procedure outlined below will take you anywhere you wish to go with the system. Of course you are free to expand and innovate upon the system as much as you feel necessary. (I would not, however, advise that you omit any of the following steps) PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS TEMPLE ARRANGEMENTS These can be as simple or as elaborate as you wish. A clean, uncluttered room with an altar or table in the center is perfectly adequate. You may wish to place your Elemental Tablets on the walls of the four quarters (Air in the East, Fire in the South, Water in the West, and Earth in the North) or you may wish to arrange them upon the altar. It is not essential to have any Tablets in the Temple at all. DIRECTIONS OF THE WORKING When invoking, that is when you wish to bring the Spirit to you, face the micro-cosmic-elemental direction dictated by the four winds; operations of Air in the East, Fire in the South, Water in the West and Earth in the North.

These, grouped about the Holy Twelvefold Table, similarly obtained, were part of the furniture of the Holy Table, as shewn in Plate I. Other appurtenances of this table will be described hereafter. II Other Pantacles were obtained in a similar manner. (Plate II) is the principal one, which, carved in wax, was placed upon the top of the table. On four others stood the feet of the table. Note first the Holy Sevenfold Table containing seven Names of God which not even the Angels are able to pronounce.

These names will be found in the Pentagram and about it. These angels are the angels of the Seven Circles of Heaven.

He symbolized the Fourth-Dimensional Universe in two dimensions as a square surrounded by 30 concentric circles (the 30 Æthyrs or Aires) whose radii increase in a geometrical proportion. The sides of the square are the four great watch-towers (Plates IV-VII) which are attributed to the elements. There is also a \"black cross\" (or \"central tablet\" according to the arrangement shewn—compare the black cross bordering the tablets in Plate III with Plate VIII). Plate III gives the general view. [The reversed letters which form the word PARAOAN are written in Enochian for convenience, as our A and 0 are not distinguishable reverse from forward.] Plate IV gives the complete attribution of the tablet of Air. The 6th file is called Linea Patris. The 7th file is called Linea Filii. The 7th line is called Linea Spiritus Sancti. The great cross divides the Tablet into four lesser (sub-elemental) Tablets, the left-hand top corner being Air of Air, the right-hand top corner Water of Air, the left-hand bottom corner Earth of Air, the remaining corner Fire of Air. Each of these lesser Tablets contains a Calvary Cross of ten squares, which governs it. Plates V, VI, and VII are similar for the other elements. This is the way in which the names are drawn from the great Tablets. [Examples taken from Water Tablet.] 1. Linea Spiritus Sancti gives the Three Holy Names of God of 3, 4, and 5 letters respectively: 63"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley MPH ARSL GAIOL 2. A whorl around the centre of the Tablet gives the name of the Great Elemental King, RAAGIOSL [similarly for Air BATAIVAH, for Earth ICZHHCAL, for Fire EDLPRNAA]. 3. The 3 lines of the central cross of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost give the names of 6 seniors. [Thus the 4 tablets hold 24 \"elders,\" as stated in the Apocalypse.] They are drawn of seven letters, each from the centre to the sides of the tablet. Linea Patris, SAIINOV and SOAIZNT Linea Filii, LAOAZRP and LIGDISA Linea S.S, SLGAIOL and LSRAHPM These three sets of names rule the whole tablet, and must be invoked before specializing in the lesser angles of the sub-elements. 4. The Calvary Crosses. The name upon the cross read vertically is the name which calls forth the powers of the lesser angle. NELAPR (water of water) OLGOTA (air of water) MALADI (earth of water) IAAASD (fire of water) The name read horizontally on the cross is that which compels the evoked force to obedience. OMEBB (water of water) AALCO (air of water) OCAAD (earth of water) ATAPA (fire of water) 5. Above the bar of the Calvary Cross remain in each case four squares. These are allotted to the Kerubim, who must next be invoked. They are: TDIM DIMT IMTD MTDI, being metatheses of these four letters.

They are ruled by names of God formed by prefixing the appropriate letter from the \"black cross\" to their own names. 6. Beneath the bar of the Calvary Cross remain 16 squares not yet accounted for. Here, beneath the presidency of the Kerubim, rule four mighty and benevolent angels— INGM LAOC VSSN RVOI 7. Triliteral names of demons or elementals are to be formed from these 16 squares, uniting the two letters on either side of the upright of the cross with a letter chosen from the Central Tablet or black cross in accordance with rules which will be given in their due place. Thus: GM, IN, OC, LA et cetera, form bases for these triliteral names. The following rules explain how the sides of the pyramids of which the squares are formed are attributed to the Sephiroth, Planets, Elements, and Zodiacal signs. 1. Great Central Cross. This has 36 squares, for the decanates of the Zodiac. On the left side of the Pyramid, Linea Patris has the Cardinal signs, the sign of the Element itself at the top, in the order of Tetragrammaton (Fire, Water, Air, Earth) going upwards. Linea Filii has the Common signs in the same order. Linea S.S. has the Kerubic signs, that of the element on the left, in the same order, right to left. But the order of the decans in each sign is reverse, and thus the planets which fill the right-hand side of the Pyramids go in the first two cases downwards, and in the third from left to right. 65"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley The upper sides of the Pyramids are all attributed to the Element of Spirit, the lower sides to the Element of the Tablet. Each square is also referred to the small card of the Tarot which corresponds to the Decan (refer to Crowley's work, 777, Weiser, 1972). 2. Calvary Crosses. Each has 10 squares. The upper sides of the Pyramids are uniformly given to Spirit, the lower sides to the Sephiroth, in the order shewn. The left-hand sides are attributed to the element of the Tablet, the right-hand sides to the sub-element of the lesser angle. 3. Kerubic Squares. The upper sides pertain to the element of the Tablet, the lower sides to the sub-element. Right and left-hand sides in this case correspond, according to a somewhat complex rule which it is unnecessary to give here. The attributions to the Court Cards of the Tarot naturally follow. 4. Lesser Squares. The upper side of each pyramid is governed by the Kerub standing on the pile above it. The lower side is governed by the Kerub also, but in order descending as they are from right to left above. [See angle of Air of Water; the Kerubs go Earth, Fire, Water, Air (from the square marked D, the fifth from the left in the top rank of the Tablet), and downward the lower sides of the squares marked 0, D, *E, Z (this should probably read 0, D, X, Z. Ed) go Earth, Fire, Water, Air.] The left-hand side refers to the element of the Tablet, the right-hand side to the sub-element of the lesser angle. 5. The Black Cross of Central Tablet.

It is quite natural that the images which are evoked by the Devotee in his ardor for the Beloved are identical or similar to those that accompany sexual longings. The traditional cultures of India and the Orient, of Africa, Polynesia, of the natives of North and South America, indeed of almost any culture unpolluted by Judeo-Christian-Islamic thought, have no difficulty whatsoever with this parallel. With the exception of the Song of Solomon, Western religious literature avoids Divine Eroticism like the plague. Even the esoteric disciplines of the West seem uncomfortable with the subject and go to great lengths to veil their terms. The bizarre nomenclature of Alchemy, when studied with half your brain in the bedroom, reveals that perhaps there are several good reasons why the alchemists were called \"puffers\". But for the most part, we in the West are expected to unite with our Divine Beloved vicariously. Nuns are the \"Brides of Christ\", we unite with the Father or the Mother only \"through the Son.\" Even the \"magic\" ceremony needed to consummate these voyeuristic unions must be experienced vicariously through a priest. In the highly explicit book The Ultimate Taboo—Sex, Religion and Magic (New Falcon Publications, 1991), we explore the abnormalities of such practices and the psycho-sociological phobic reactions to Sex Magic. I do not intend to use this space to serve as an introduction to the theories or techniques of Sex 103"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley Magick or Tantra. There are many fine works available that introduce those subjects very well. For the reader who is already knowledgeable on these subjects, a few helpful hints concerning how Enochian can be used in these areas may prove valuable and rewarding. The modern view that our normal waking consciousness stands somewhere between the limitless potential of transcendental experience and the \"demons\" that run amok in our subconscious mind is not too dissimilar to the medieval view that Mankind is sandwiched between God and the Angels, between Heaven and Hell. The working hypothesis of the magician of old went something like this, \"God has dominion over me and compels me to do His will. I have dominion over the spirit world, (especially over the so-called fallen angels), and just as I look up to God, they look up to me, therefore I can compel them to do my bidding.\" In 1458, the noted Qabalist and court magician, Abraham the Jew, in his classic work. The Book of the Sacred Magick of Abra-Melin The Mage, took this concept of the hierarchy of responsibility a sublime step forward and catapulted magick to the same level as the Yogic disciplines. Simply put, to work the magick, you must first be united with Divinity. (This experience he calls The Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.) This initiatory landmark is only accomplished after a six month period of purification and a strict regimen of ever-increasing longing for union with the Angel. Once this \"marriage\" is consummated and the \"blessing\" of the Angel's presence is bestowed, the magician immediately turns to the lower spiritual world and bestows the same \"blessing\" on the resident denizens and extracts from them a pledge of loyalty and support. 104"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick These wild and infernal spirits who, up until now were unacknowledged, uncontrolled and most likely at odds with the True Will of the magician, were now going to be given the opportunity to work for his and their greater good. And now that the magician had formed an intimate alliance with the Divine, he had the spiritual \"authority\" to force the lower spirits to cooperate. Thus, Abraham the Jew reveals an indispensable truth; Magick demands an assault on two fronts at once. It requires realization of your responsibility not only to that which is above but also to that which is below. It is only through you that the Divine (your Superconsciousness) can manifest on this plane. Without you the spirits of the Infernal regions (your subconsciousness) have no hope of \"salvation\" (balance and control). Indeed, without your controlling influence they will become a very real threat to your life and sanity. You must see to it that each area receives proper and equal attention. Neglect your higher aspiration and you will find that you soon lack the spiritual integrity to command the spirits. Neglect the spirits and they will sooner or latter surface to demand your attention. Wild beasts can be domesticated and trained to serve you. If you treat them well and allow them to share in your continuing good fortune they can realize their greater potentiality. However, if you abuse them or forget to feed them they will inevitably seize the first opportunity to break out and devour you for their needed nourishment.

Please pay special attention to the following. ENOCHIAN SEX MAGICK But to love me is better than all things Liber AL, I, 61 I will now proceed to ignore my own advice regarding other magician's visions. I hope the reader will recognize the value of what follows and will kindly forgive me. In the series of visions of the 30 Æthyrs that Crowley chronicled in his remarkable work. The Vision And The Voice, he describes his vision of the Body of the great Goddess. The imagery is so powerful and his narrative colored with expressions of such tender awe, that one cannot but share, however temporarily, his overwhelming desire to unite with Her. To lose oneself utterly in Her would most certainly result in such intensity of bliss as to make the ecstasy of orgasm seem as a candle held up to the sun. But that was Crowley's vision... Crowley's Great Goddess. To dwell on Her when you have your own Great Goddess (or God) \"waiting\" for your devotion would be as stupid as refusing a date with the lovely girl next door (who has secretly loved you all her life) because you have to sit at home alone, and pine over a painting of Helen of Troy. 106"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick Do you see where I'm heading with this? By a serious and concerted effort on your part, it is possible for you to achieve the highest level of spiritual experience your evolutionary-initiatory status will permit, including a relationship with the Divine Beloved. Once you \"know\" Her (or Him) all subsequent \"earthly\" ecstasies take the form of devotional offerings to the Great Lover who rewards the devotee with increasingly sweeter embraces until finally the embrace is eternal. Where do you seek the initial Vision? In yourself. How can you start to look in yourself? One way is by systematically skrying the 30 Æthyrs. Nor let the fools mistake love; for there are love and love. There is the dove, and there is the serpent. Choose ye well! Liber AL, 1,57 In The Little Mermaid, Hans Christian Andersen writes of an Undine who is so enamored of a mortal man that she relinquishes her status as an immortal being for the opportunity to love and be loved by him. This charming tale contains a profound magical truth. Elemental spirits, whose natures are so specialized that they lack the balance of qualities necessary for sentient life, do indeed long for union with \"complete\" beings such as ourselves. Because their natures are universal they truly are immortal and if they should ever achieve union with a mortal they would actually \"die\" to their old, incomplete existence to be \"born\" into the life of their beloved. This is exactly what we do in our relationship with the Divine Principal. The spirits of the Elemental Tablets are particularly suitable for such operations and all that is required is to call them up. It is so simple that you may 107"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley set to work ill-prepared for success. A few words of caution might be in order. Think before you proceed. Just what are you really prepared to handle? Experience has shown that it is most often wisest to contact a spirit from very low in the elemental hierarchy for operations such as this. Also, as in the everyday world, it is unwise to try to juggle too many of these relationships at the same time. If you think \"Hell hath no fury like that of a woman scorned,\" think again. And sometimes jealousy really is a green-eyed monster. Finally, and most importantly, Never confuse your love for the Divine with your love for the Elemental. The sexual \"role\" the magician assumes when making love to the Goddess (or God) is diametrically different than the \"role\" he or she plays when mating with an elemental spirit. In the former, the magician's attitude is that of adoration and awe and release is a gift from above, the result of ecstatic surrender. (To assume that attitude with an elemental lover would be spiritual suicide.) The sexual \"role\" the magician assumes with the elemental is one of loving dominance. The Spirit surrenders to you. You bestow your ecstasy as a gift and allow your elemental partner to share, through you, the Divine love. Confusing these two \"loves\" is surely the fountainhead of all the ills sexual repression has visited upon mankind. If it is your Will to be a sex magician, see to it that you use your magick to face and conquer your life, not to hide from it. 108"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Chapter Seven Techniques Of Enochian Sex Magick By Christopher S. Hyatt, Ph. D. There is no evidence that the communicating Angels that delivered the Enochian system to Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelly ever instructed them concerning sexual applications of the art. Biographers will be quick to point out the famous incident of April 1587 when, according to Kelly, the Angel Madimi suggested to Kelly that he and Dr. Dee share their wives in common. (Dee was absent during this communication). Enochian scholars argue that the text of this communication contains many flaws that do not characterize other less personal communications and that this may have been a case of magical wishful thinking on Kelly's part. Nevertheless it seems they did indeed swap wives and in spite of obvious attempts to erase the manuscript, the record confirms this. It seems the only \"magical\" result of this \"operation\" was the break up of Dee and Kelly as magical partners and the close of one of the most remarkable chapters in magical history. To those knowledgeable in the theory and techniques of Tantra, the keys of the Enochian system open a treasure-house of practical applications. The exercises outlined below should be practiced only after you have a thorough mastery of the system in all its non-sexual applications. Any uncertainties on the part of the magician as to what he or she is doing will destroy needed concentration and create a \"break\" which will absorb the entire force of the operation. (In sexual workings that could be an overabundant amount 109"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley of energy particularly if you perform the exercises in my Tantra book.) EXPLORATION OF THE THIRTY ÆTHYRS As written earlier in the text, the Thirty Æthyrs are the \"heavens\" or Aires of the system. Starting with the 30th Æthyrs and working to the 1st, the Magician explores only as far as his or her personal level of Initiation will permit. This process is comparable to \"pathworkings\" of the Qabalistic system. In Enochian terms, the \"Great Work\" of the magician is to master all 30 Æthyrs. (Starting with 30 and ending with 1) Experiences with the 30 Æthyrs are highly personal and entirely unique to each magician. Working with the Æthyrs can be a lifetime endeavor and it is entirely presumptuous and inappropriate for another individual to \"guide\" another in this area. This personal aspect of the Æthyrs coupled with the simplicity of its \"one-Call-does-it-all\" procedure makes it ideal for preliminary workings. The great stumbling block to exploring the Æthyr is the difficulty one encounters in \"breaking through\" to the next Æthyr. In the higher levels this may be because the magician has reached his or her initiatory limit. But in the lower Æthyrs it is more often the case that the magician simply can't \"let go\" and refocus his or her attention to the section of the brain where the vision is taking place. In Secrets of Western Tantra I provide an entire array of exercises which will help the Magician \"let go.\" The following exercise is intended exclusively for workings of the Thirty Æthyrs. There are two participants whom we will refer to as the Magician and the Assistant. For our illustration the male participant is the Magician and will recite the Call and \"receive\" 110"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick the vision, the female participant is the Assistant and will eventually record the vision. These gender roles are for illustration only. The Magician can just as easily be female and the Assistant male. This particular operation is equally effective for participants of the same sex and can also be adapted for solitary workings. It makes absolutely no difference who is Magician and who is Assistant. It is only important that the couple decide before the operation commences. Note: There must be no ambiguity about the willingness of either participant to take part in an operation of this kind. If one participant has to be coerced, begged or tricked into participation the vortex of ill-will that will emanate from the offended party will insure not only the failure of the operation but also the destruction of a more precious \"magical asset\", the respect of another human being. EXAMPLE: The Magician wishes to explore the 30th Æthyr, TEX, and the Assistant has expressed to him that it is her Will to participate in the operation. Both participants bathe and dress at first in simple, soft, white garments. You may light incense, bum candles or use lights or soft music to enhance the mood. Small amounts of alcohol are also useful. Prepare the room in which you are working with the appropriate symbols for the Æthyr such as the sigils of the Governors or the Elemental Tablet from which they are taken. In the case of TEX it would be the Water Tablet. (One couple I know has the Elemental Tablets and the Tablet of Union constructed entirely of wooden pyramids which they painstakingly have painted and lettered in Enochian. These are placed on the floor, under their bed, prior to æthyric or elemental workings.) 111"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley Begin by performing the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram in the area in which you will be working.

Still facing east: Trace the Banishing pentagram of Earth and vibrate YHVH (yoad — hay — vaahv — hay), as you thrust your symbolic dagger into the heart of the pentagram. With your arm still extended, turn to the South: Trace the Banishing pentagram of Earth and vibrate the name ADONAI (aah — doh — noy). {Remember to thrust the symbolic dagger as you vibrate each God name}. With your arm still extended, turn to the West: 112"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick Trace the Banishing pentagram of Earth and vibrate the name EHIEH (eh — hayh — yay). With your arm still extended, turn to the North: Trace the Banishing pentagram of Earth and vibrate the name AGLA (ah — guh — lah). With your arm still extended return to the East, completing the circle. Now Imagine yourself surrounded in a Flaming Circle of four Pentagrams. Stand straight with your arms out forming the shape of a Cross: Say: Before me Raphael (rah - fay - ale) Behind me Gabriel (gah - bree - ale) At my right shoulder, Michael (mee- khigh - ale) At my left shoulder, Auriel (oh - ree - ale) Then Say: Before me flames the Pentagram Behind me shines the six-rayed Star. Finish by repeating the Qabalistic Cross: Touch your forehead and say Atoh Touch your Heart and say Malkuth Touch your Right Shoulder and say Ve- Geburah Touch your Left Shoulder and say Ve- Gedulah Touch your Heart and say Le-Olam Point the symbolic dagger inward and say Amen. (See the Appendix for examples of the invoking and banishing Pentagrams of all the Elements which 113"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley are used in Elemental Temple openings and invocations). The Magician then recites the Call of the 30th Æthyr, TEX, (Madariatza das perifa TEX... etc.) while the Assistant simply relaxes and meditates upon the sounds of the Enochian Call. When the Call is completed let the Magician slowly vibrate the names of the Governors. (In the case of TEX there are four Governors. All other Æthyrs have three.) Then, (believe it or not), forget about the operation. Relax, take your time and enjoy each other's company. Build slowly and naturally to greater levels of arousal. Continue to do everything you can to sustain your love making (At least 25 minutes, but for God's sake don't keep looking at your watch!). The idea is to become joyfully and totally exhausted. Then at the moment of orgasm (and not a split second before) let the Magician remember the purpose of the operation (the Skrying of the Æthyr) and repeat the first line of the Call; Madariatza das perifa TEX cahisa micaolazoda saanire caosago od fifsa balzodizodarasa laida. This may be done verbally or mentally but it must be well memorized so that it can come forth effortlessly. (Note: A tape recorder can be used for both repeating Calls and taking notes. Sometimes two recorders are very handy, one for taking notes and the other for playing Calls). The Magician then falls exhausted and allows the flood of images to wash through his brain. The temptation to fall asleep will be almost irresistible and that is where the skill of the Assistant is most vital. After a few quiet moments if the Magician is not relating his vision to the Assistant she must take it upon herself to question him. This requires a high 114"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick degree of tact and subtlety for she does not want to disturb the vision and yet she cannot allow him to fall into a deeper state of unconsciousness. This takes practice. She should have a pad of paper and a pencil handy and should write down everything that the Magician says. She should be especially careful to correctly spell any unknown words or phrases and she should not hesitate to ask the Magician (or the entity speaking through the Magician) the correct spelling of Angelic words. If the vision stalls and reaches a point where nothing further is happening the Assistant can sometimes give it a push. EXAMPLE Magician: All I see is a bunch of trees. Nothing is happening. Assistant: Try turning around. Do you see anything now? Magician: Just more trees but there is a small pond in the middle. Assistant: 'Walk over to the pond. Look in the pond and tell me what you see. Magician: At first I see only my own reflection but as I keep looking I see that the pond is actually a bowl supported by the wings of four Angels, etc. If angels or other beings appear in the vision they must be tested by repeating the names of the Governors one at a time. If the entity shows discomfort at the name of any of the Governors dismiss it by continuing to repeat the Governor's name until it disappears and a being appears that is strengthened by hearing the names. Do not be afraid of anything you \"see\" or \"hear\". Maintain an attitude of good natured tolerance even if hideous sights or terrifying beings or creatures appear. 115 "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley Act like a dispassionate explorer. Fear is failure and the forerunner of failure. When it is clear that the vision is finished, or when it is obvious that the Magician is now fatigued or ready to fall asleep it is time to end the operation. It is of the utmost importance that the Magician now \"snap out of it\" for it is he who must banish and close the Temple. If the Magician is reluctant to \"wake up\" and perform his duties it is the Assistant's responsibility to see that he does. No effort should be spared to \"break the spell\" and return the Magician to the objective world. Turn on the lights, talk loudly, get a drink, or splash some water on your face. Finally, he performs the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and the Magician and the Assistant review the notes and transfer them to the Magician's diary. The comments of the Assistant are often extremely important and should not be omitted in the record. Often the couple will wish to change roles and explore the same Æthyr on a subsequent occasion. Allow at least one day between operations. ELEMENTAL OPERATIONS AND CREATION OF THE MAGICKAL CHILD Dr. Israel Regardie believed that certain sex magick techniques could be used by advanced students to incarnate \"spiritual\" energies on the physical plane, as well as making important shifts in the orientation of the Psyche and the Universe. In other words, if these methods were used properly, couples could bring into the world \"divine\" forces in the children they generated, who could influence the future of the race. In addition to creating \"real children\" these methods could be used to create \"bio-psycho-spiritual vessels\", which would shift the focus of the mind as well as develop new powers and abilities. 116"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick The creation of the magickal child by ritualized sexual practices is symbolic in one sense of the whirling forces of nature, mixing and separating in their chaotic dance of creation. This mixing and separating process is vividly displayed in the Elemental Tablets and the Tablet of Union of the Enochian system. Working with these basic forces of nature allows conscious co-operation and co-creating with the cosmos, and the magician becomes a miniature form of the cosmic process following its root law. By willful and conscious co-operation the magician increases and refines his energies, sacrificing himself or herself willingly to Nature instead of being a passive food source in the spiritual food chain. The realization that man's emotional, physical and sexual energies are food for the \"gods\" can create great personal turmoil at first, however when one begins to joyously participate in the spiritual feeding frenzy, one is \"elevated perpendicularly to infinity.\" SELECTING THE MAGICKAL CHILD THE ENOCHIAN METHOD The selection process is the most difficult and, in truth, the most magickal, aspect of the operation. The \"soul searching\" necessary for such an important act is awesome and should not be embarked upon with a frivolous attitude. The Enochian adept (and no other should embark upon such project) is intimately familiar with every area of the Elemental environment and with his or her current initiatory position relative to the Thirty Æthyrs. By reviewing his or her personal diaries of perhaps hundreds of non sexual Enochian workings, the Magician can determine the areas of the system that manifest the qualities which are desirable in the magickal child. 117"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley For the purpose of our illustration we will say that we wish create a magickal child of purity and beauty. A child capable of reflecting and transmitting energy and impressions without being affected. A child such as this might be a great actor or politician because in this child others see themselves reflected. This is charming and disarming to others because when they look at the child they will see only what they want to see. By checking the records of our previous evocations we see that TDIM, the Kerub ruling the Water Subangle of Water is the perfect Spirit to manifest in such a child. The technique as outlined below has been adapted from the exercise The Orgastic Circulation of Light and is an excellent example of Tantric Enochian evocation. In Dr. Regardie's copy of Wilhelm's Secret Of The Golden Flower, 3rd impression, 1935, there are a number of passages underlined. Dr. Regardie was not a habitual underliner, thus we may assume that when he did underline it was for a very good reason. One of the passages which he underlined more than once contained references to the circulation of light. In the next method, the proper circulation of light is essential for true magickal effects to occur and has been modified for use in creating the magickal child. It is urged that the partners should practice the ritual many times prior to including the sexual aspects. As a rule it is wise to practice this together holding hands or touching in some fashion. At the time determined most auspicious for the conception of the magickal child the Temple is made ready. Banished, Cleansed and Consecrated. The Temple is then opened in the Grade of 3° = 8° as outlined in Chanokh and the two participants recite a 118"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick brief Oath declaring their intention to perform this creative act. PART I THE GREAT WHIRLINGS The male should be on his back and the female should sit on top of him. Move only when instructed, unless the penis begins to lose its stiffness. Begin by imagining a scintillating white light about the size of a small basketball forming above the head and piercing the top of the skull. This is called the Kether point. Now vibrate the Three Holy Names of God (from the Water Tablet). MPH ARSL GAIOL as the sphere of Light grows brighter and more energetic. Do this for five minutes. On the last six vibrations of MPH ARSL GAIOL the female should move on each sound of the Names. As the force of this whirling ball of power becomes exceedingly real for you and your partner, allow the energy to descend slowly through the head. Allow it to rest in the throat or Da'ath point. Here imagine a lavender color. Vibrate the Name of the Great Elemental King of Water, RAAGIOSL until the energy becomes exceedingly real for you and your partner. Again on the last six vibrations of RAAGIOSL the female should move six times. Bring the energy down through the chest until it rests at the Heart or Tiphareth. Vibrate the Names of the six Seniors of the Water Tablet, SAIINOV, SOAIZNT, LAOAZRP, LIGDISA, SLGAIOL, LSRAHPM. The color of light should be golden yellow growing brighter and clearer as you vibrate each Name. 119"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley On the six last vibrations of the names of the Seniors the female should move six times. Move the power through the diaphragm and abdominal region to the pelvis (Yesod), and vibrate the Divine Names of the Calvary Cross, Water of Water, NELAPR, OMEBB visualizing a sphere of deep purple. Here on the last ten vibrations of NELAPR and OMEBB the male should move ten times very slowly. Finally, allow the energy to descend through the legs until it formulates at Malkuth, the feet. Both participants vibrate the name of the Kerub, the Name of their magickal child TDIM visualizing a black sphere. The male should again move ten times quickly on the final vibrations of the Child's name. Now, draw the energy up from the Black light of Malkuth changing colors as described above as it ascends to Kether. When the light reaches Kether concentrate on the White brilliance of this region. When the light is at Kether and your movements are complete, meditate silently for a few moments and then begin the circulation of white light. Note: At times Dr. Regardie ignored the different colors of the Spheres and simply used the white scintillating light of Kether for each of the points. However, he and I agreed that the colored system is better suited for the practice of Sex Magick. PART II THE ORGASTIC CIRCULATION OF LIGHT Circulate the energy of the the White Light as follows: 120"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick Allow it to descend downward and outward via the left side of the body during every exhalation. When it reaches the left foot, transfer the energy over to the right foot and allow it to ascend the right side of the body on the inhalation. This should be done at least 10 times. The partners should move slowly in unison 10 times. The second circulation of energy begins in Kether and travels down the front of the body on the exhalation and then up the back of the body on the inhalation. This should be done at least ten times as well. The partners should move slowly in unison ten times. The third circulation, beginning with Kether follows down through the body on the exhalation until it reaches Malkuth. The energy is drawn up through the body to Kether on the inhalation. When it reaches the Crown, imagine it to discharge like water from a fountain, at the end of each inhalation. The fire and sparks of this scintillating fountaining go up and out through the Crown and then descend down and encompasses the body on the exhalation. After the final circulation has been completed and the fountaining maintained for a few movements, the couple should begin moving and breathing heavily as they surround themselves with sparkling light. The .movements should then become spontaneous and at the moment of orgasm the light should be gathered and thrust beyond Sahasrara, toward the Chakra with No Name. PART III THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF THE LIGHT The orgastic Light of the Chakra of No Name may be likened to the Philosopher's Stone, The Golden Flower, or the Lotus. It is a body of light created by the process of transmutation of spiritual-sexual energy 121"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Enochian World of Aleister Crowley and is the womb of the magickal child. This is an experiential realization, thus, the proof of the pudding is in the Doing and Creating. The process of transmutation requires the proper balance and mixing of heat and cold, passive and active, and white and black. In a broader sense we are using tremendous active forces to create a non-active force. The nurturing we provide the womb-child through our practices creates a worthy resting place of deep silence for the aspirants involved in the creation process. The circulating of orgastic light is no doubt one of the most beautiful secrets of the Great Work. As the light circulates again and again and your practices become more powerful and refined, a crystallization occurs and you begin to form the magickal child. Whether you choose it to be physical or spiritual or both, the creation of this spirit body allows you to have contact with the forces of the higher Spiritual Body. You have not only opened the doors of perception, but can now begin the process of real action in a way unknown to those who lack this initiation. 122 "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Chapter'EightThe EnochianDict i onary,wOROS'\"Aoi ( AAo JAoio mAoloA\" . i. on inAb il.(Ap i).

It is to be performed after the \"Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram\" and is most appropriate for invocations of the Enochian Seniors. 1. Stand upright, feet together, left arm at side, right arm across body, holding the wand or other weapon upright in the median line. Then face East, and say: 2. \"I.N.R.I. Yod. Nun. Resh. Yod. Virgo, Isis, Mighty Mother. Scorpio, Apophis, Destroyer. Sol, Osiris, Slain and Risen. Isis, Apophis, Osiris, IAO.\" 3. Extend the arms in the form of a cross, and say: \"The sign of Osiris Slain.\" (See illustration.) 4. Raise the right arm to point upwards, keeping the elbow square, and lower the left arm to point downwards, keeping the elbow square, while turning the head over the left shoulder looking down so that the eyes follow the left forearm, and say: \"The sign of the Mourning of Isis\" (See illustration.) 5.

Cross the arms on the breast, and bow the head, and say: The sign of Osiris Risen.\" (See illustration.) 7. Extend the arms again as in (3) and cross them again as in (6), saying: \"L.V.X. Lux, the Light of the Cross.\" 8. With the magical weapon trace the Hexagram of Fire in the East, saying: \"ARARITA.\" (This is a word created by the initials of a Hebrew sentence which means \"One is His Beginning: One is His Individuality: His Permutation is One.\") This hexagram consists of two equilateral triangles, both apices pointing upwards. Begin at the top of the upper triangle and trace it in a clockwise direction. The top of the lower triangle should coincide with the central point of the upper triangle. 9. Turn to the South. Trace the Hexagram of Earth saying: \"ARARITA.\" This Hexagram has the apex of the lower triangle pointing downwards, and it should be capable of inscription in a circle. 10. Turn to the West. Trace the Hexagram of Air saying: \"ARARITA.\" This hexagram is like that of Earth: but the bases of the triangles coincide, forming a diamond.  142 "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Enochian Sex Magick 11. Turn to the North. Trace the Hexagram of Water saying: \"ARARITA.\" This hexagram has the lower triangle placed above the upper, so that their apices coincide. 12. Return to the East and repeat steps (1-7) The Banishing Ritual is identical, save that the direction of the Hexagrams must be reversed. To invoke or banish Planets or Zodiacal signs, the Hexagram of Earth alone is used. Draw the hexagram, beginning from the point which is attributed to the planet you are dealing with. 143 "}]
