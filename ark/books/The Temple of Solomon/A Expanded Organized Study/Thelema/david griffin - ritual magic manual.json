The syn- chronicity of that holiday made it a table for three and not just two, since Erich Neumann's The Great Mother, the beloved Isis, was in our midst from the first moment of our contact. When I walked into the empty neon lit dining room (hardly the ambiance of a British Museum reading room where Magicians long before us made such similar histor- ical encounters) my first reaction was disappointment. There sat this man looking pitifully alone among a tangled architecture of twisted wire tables and chairs, tall but too thin in stature, a military haircut and the most hollow, vacant yet absorbing eyes that held the look of a zealot! My immediate resolve was to make this as painlessly brief a meeting as possible! Little did I know in those first seconds that those eyes were truly and undeniably capable of staring into and surviving the fires of the gods while not going blind, the eyes of magical genius and such enormous raw talent that only a holy fanaticism indeed could contain such sacred and hungry wantonness for the wildest, most unex-plored and deepest of mysteries. He had written to me through a colleague: a post card from Cairo, Egypt, with a Beverly Hills, California, mailing address. The card was referred to me since I lived in Southern California. I sent him a pa- thetically hasty reply on a piece of yellow pad paper written in pen- cil. Since my introduction to the fifth edition of The Golden Da7un by Israel Reeardie had been vublished in 1986. I was used to receiving"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Foreword 15The Iiitt~al Magic Munual cards and letters from all over the world from would-be and hopeful magicians interested in Initiation and training with me as I had been trained by Regardie. To that first meeting, I had only brought with me my copy of The Golden Dawn (autographed by Regardie years before) and Tabatha Cicero's New Gulden Da?on Xitunl Tarot, a modern tarot deck which accurately portrays the Tarot Trumps as described in the Golden Dawn Initiatory rituals. At random, David selected the High Priestess (Moon) and the Devil (Capricorn) cards from the deck (the Woman and the Serpent of Revelation) which presaged the theme of our magical relatio~~ship to the present date. After breakfast, we vis- ited Regardie's grave nearby and on the way I returned home to gather up Regardie's ritual wine cup and Enochian chess set which were just a few of the items of his magical paraphernalia he had given to me as a gift several years before. At the grave, David improvised a ritual in- voking the energies of Daath that was, despite the hubris of such an endeavor, stunning in conception and execution. Having worked with the likes of a magical titan as Israel Regardie, very, very little im- pressed me at that phase of my magical career, but there on that sun- dripped grave lawn, I knew I had another true Zanoni in my presence with his makeshift turban of white silk embroidered with the Queen scale colors of the Tree of Life and a talisman he had made of rose leaves and 24 carat gold while a lone hawk blessed the beginning of our conjoint adventure by diving through an aquamarine sky overhead. The rose leaves and gold talisman of that day's meeting were the foretelling piece which prototypically announced his future exhaus- tive and elegant research into the Inner or Second Order work of the R.R. et A.C., the magical curriculum which immediately follows the Golden Dawn or Outer Order elemental Initiations. March 25, 1997, is the 15th anniversary of my resurrecting classical Golden Dawn Initia- tory work in the United States through founding a Temple in Los Ange- les, California, under Regardie's close direction. Additionally, June 26, 1997, was also the fifteenth anniversary of my receiving the Adeptus Minor (5=6) Grade from Israel Regardie in a Vault built with sainted patience by Chic Cicero in Columbus, Georgia. And so, in remembering these anniversary milestones in my personal magical career, it is an honor to be asked to introduce this important work, The Ritual Magic Manual: A Cornplete Course in Practical Magic, which explores all facets of the R.R. et A.C. as not as yet fully accomplished heretofore. Having trained many magicians through the Outer Order process, I have repeatedly observed that many of them perceive attainment of the 5=6 Grade of Adeptus Minor as a conclusion in itself, resting on du- bious laurels of success and not remembering the exhortation in the sa-cred Obligation of the 5=6 Grade Ritual (Yesod) where the Chief Adept states, \"...I also undertake to work unassisted at the subjects pre- scribed for study in the various practical grades from Zelator Adeptus Minor to Adept Adeptus Minor, on pain of being degraded to that of Lord of the Paths of the Portal only.\" The hoped-for experience of growing into Tiphareth by advancing into 5=6 is attaining to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. But al- though Regardie states in The Tree Of L$e how individual and unpre- dictable such attainment may be, it is often a growing and developmen- tal process rather than an isolated event (infrequently occurring during the 5=6 Initiation itself) for which this book can provide the first guide of its kind. Every Initiate who walks out of a Vault of the Adepti for the first time should be handed a copy of this book as a powerful prompt and practical, magical roadmap, a true grimoire to keep working toward that supreme experience of the Holy Guardian Angel which Regardie further states in The Tree of Life as \"...the supreme object of all magical ritual ... in other words, the communion with the Higher Self. ...It brings with it new powers, new extensions of consciousness, and a new vision of life.\" The \"Introduction\" is an important and salient overview which as- sists the advanced as well as beginning Magician. It should not be over- looked in addressing the more complex material further on in the text. The author addresses and reminds us of the often neglected concept of \"vibration\" (so succinctly elucidated in the occult classic, The Ky-balion, by Three Initiates). It additionally emphasizes the important consideration of psychotherapy as conjoint with magical practice (which is an idea Regardie espoused until his death). Common sense and \"how to\" reminders of not accidentally \"de-charging\" magical weapons, a discussion of the significant differences between channel- ing, guided fantasy, and Skrying in the Spirit Vision all help to re- mind the student to be wary of carelessness and self-delusion. The au- thor also examines the important point of selecting the sidereal as op- posed to tropical system for astrological mapping and includes elemen- tary Qabalistic information and correspondences. Of particular and important academic note is that the author has addressed the \"...numerous corruptions and misconceptions ...\" of the various names in the frequently flawed extant published hierarchies and has corrected them. He also provides a believable argument for a rethinking and augmenting of former guidelines to Enochian pronunciation."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"16 17 The Ritual Magic Manual The opening chapter on Basic Rituals is what adds to the \"user friendliness\" of this practical manual, for it affords the beginner (and reminds the experienced practitioner) of the necessary tools to begin building (or continue reinforcing) in the Sphere of Sensation (Aura) those symbols which produce gradual and imperceptible but undeni- able and absolutely necessary change for legitimate and not just nomi- nal, magical adeptship. This is change which impacts the student not only psychologically and emotionally but also physiologically where brain chemistry, hormonal activity, and central nervous system func- tion all become more finely attuned and harmonious in their interrela- tion. One of the most frequently overlooked issues in magical training is that lovely and poetic phrase in the oath of the Adeptus Minor Grade that states, \"I further promise and swear that with the Divine Per- mission I will, from this day forward, apply myself to the Great Work -which is, to purify and exalt my Spiritual Nature so that with the Divine Aid I may at length attain to be more than human ...\" This means exactly and literally what it says! An Adept's body in terms of physiology, chemistry, structure, and function is not the same as the average man, or what Regardie referred to as \"homo normalis.\" By at- tending (Tarot Trump #1-The Magician) to \"...symbol, ceremonial, and sacrament...,\" the anabolic and catabolic activities of the body in their processes actually do (literally) purify and consecrate the Temple of the physical body to prepare it for contact with what Paul Foster Case refers to in The True Arrd Invisible Rosicrrician Order as \"Contact with this True Rosicrucian Order, which is impossible without the necessary physical changes.\" So cast a scant eye on the Grade titles many so- called Adepts publicly (and tastelessly!) place behind their names as they are usually only nominal! Additionally, keep in mind that \"purification and consecration\" is also a psychological process which will expel the dross of the personality which can also result in the eruption of any variety of personal unconscious material (the academic and historic term is \"complex\") which is well illustrated in the symbolic diagram in the Golden Dawn system as \"The Garden of Eden After the Fall.\" And finally, every single time any ritual is performed to the best of one's ability and experience, regardless of how halting or even fraught with the occasional error, a physical change(s) occurs in the practitioner's physiology. Of particular importance in this chapter's list of rituals are the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and the Middle Pillar tech- nique. The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) is not un- Foreword like a kind of daily magical \"brushing of teeth\" which one should be as devoted to as that same daily hygienic practice! In my experience, I have observed that daily work with the LBRP does not gain momen- tum until after about 90 days of faithful practice, particularly for be- ginners. Additionally, experienced practitioners frequently abandon this simple protective and deeply symbolic technique as elementary and unnecessary and experience the attendant, unsettling fallout of de- pression, oversensitivity to others' emotional atmospheres (particularly overall negativity and generalized depression or anxi- ety), odd experiences, or just plain \"bad luck\" in their day to day per- sonal lives. Keep in mind that the LBRP is not only for protection of the Sphere of Sensation, but also assuredly sensitizes the physic cen- ters of perception and attracts any variety of energy/thought forms on the Inner Planes for which the would-be Magician needs discernment, a healthy and fortified ego not easily given to inflation by the archetypes, and downright common sense with some modicum of bal- ance and groundedness! The Middle Pillar technique is what Regardie had frequently called the \"sine qua non\" of Magic, an absolute and nonnegotiable ne- cessity for Magical success. The Middle Pillar not only enhances relax- ation and produces a generalized sense of balance and well being, but also slowly but assuredly builds into the Sphere of Sensation those vi- tal (and \"real\") \"spiritual organs\" which makes communication with the inner planes and reception of the Universal Energy (Prana, Orgone, LVX) possible and appreciable. A well done Middle Pillar should take approximately 30 minutes to perform (if not longer), and Regardie could not stress enough the importance of attending particularly to the relaxation and deep breathing processes in preparation for it. He as- cribed to Wilhelm Reich's theory of body character armor which in part is caused by chronic tension and unconscious muscle rigidity, thus preventing the full flow of the Universal Energy. For safety, the stu- dent should work with only white light as a visualization aid in its performance for considerable time, always opening and closing with a LBRP. Unless the practitioner works with the Middle Pillar technique daily and patiently, the rest of magical \"work\" is only personal the- ater, so much occult and narcissistic claptrap and frankly a pure and unutterable, total waste of time! Knowing all the names of the Qabal- istic Angels on the head of any variety of Magical pin will only de- velop one into absolutely nothing more than that kind of insufferable anal retentive bore who abounds in all occult circles and unfortunately can only rhapsodize on meaningless minutiae. There is no other way"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"18 The Ritual Magic Mantial toward the heights than through discipline and a willingness to actu- ally change the body, mind, and psyche into the most fit of vehicles for this stunning and Great Work. There are no shortcuts, there is no drug, there is no positive and glamorized parental transference which will do more than eventually turn into a pillar of salt like Lot's wife! Regardie's only criticisms of my personal magical process (and biting criticisms they were) were when I was lax in the regular and disci- plined performance of the Middle Pillar. The student is further re-ferred to Regardie's The One Year Mantlal. Anyone who can go through a year of these exercises and come out still standing will be way ahead of the magical game and deserve my personal congratulations for a job exceedingly well done in taking self in hand and to task! Of particular importance is the jewel of the chapter entitled \"Unity, All is God.\" Its humble and even homespun writing style shows the purest distillation of Regardie's thinking in his later years. All of the philosophical fundamentals of Magic are in this chapter. There is nothing else! Ev- erything else is only ornament. This simple chapter alone deserves rereading time and time again at different stages in one's magical ca- reer. The bulk of David Griffin's book presents rituals for Elemental, Planetary, Zodiacal, Sephirotic, and Talismanic Magic. These are written in a cogent style with clear instructions and numerous accompa- nying diagrams. The manual format allows great ease for the practi- tioner to immediately work with the ritual of his/her choice without having to look up appropriate names and symbolic designations in complicated lists of correspondences. No other book so clearly combines the flashing colors with the assumption of god forms. Additionally, there is a unique unifying of Enochian, Planetary, and Zodiacal mate- rial while interpreting, explaining, and integrating \"The Book of the Concourse of Forces.\" Chapter seven addresses demonic evocation, a controversial topic all too frequently sensationalized or treated ignorantly. The author's concise and careful comments include all the appropriate psychological and technical cautions while adding that dimension of demonic evocation as interpreted through the lens of modern psychology. This writer and Regardie had countless discussions regarding the role psy- chotherapy and psychological theory (of varying modalities) played in Magic. In Regardie's Middle Pillar, in 1938, he wrote, \"These ideas are mentioned not because a systematic union of Magic and Psychology will be here presented, but in the hope that this effort will spur some psychologist acquainted with magical and mystical techniques to at- Foreword tempt such a task. Whoever does succeed in welding the two indissol- ubly together, to him mankind will ever be grateful.\" Regardie was indeed a prophet of his day, for nearly 60 years later, any variety of schools of psychological thought, particularly Jung's Analytical psy- chology, have not been afraid to attempt swimming in the unknown and deep waters of the meaning of the unconscious. The author's elucidation of demonic evocation as bridged with psychological theory is courageous and decidedly daring but not foolhardy. And many a con- sulting room around the world steeped in the quagmire of fossilized thinking and terribly bereft of specific and effective technique would do well to at least consider how magical techniques such as these could enhance the patient's experience of life and integration of personality. However, the risk of identification with the archetypes of the uncon- scious always portends strong, uncontrolled possibilities of ego infla- tion, and enormous inner and outer destruction, so all caution and care is a necessary ingredient for even the most ambitious explorers of interi- ority! Far too little serious academic work has been done in these re- mote and primitive areas of understanding the psyche, and the field is wide open for study like the truly seductive and immeasurable inner space it actually is. But let the Magician beware lest untrained enthu- siasm and unskilled illusions of invincibility maximize its dangers. This writer would suggest leaving this portion of study strictly alone for many years until balance, individual fulfillment, overall health, and stability manifest in the outer life to reflect the same within. Even then, the Magician needs two strong companion guides along this narrow road: a mature and experienced psychotherapist or analyst with some respect and open mindedness for the Magical Arts as well as a seasoned Magician whose own life exemplifies sanity, compassion, and clarity of thought. Regarding this topic, I am reminded of a journal entry dated August 4, 1983. It was the evening before Regardie and I were to leave for Figi, New Zealand, and Australia. We had talked well into the night specifically picking apart a study of pathology as related to Jungian analysis and how the complexes compared with the medieval forms of entities used in evocation. Regardie commented, \"Now there is a correspondence between the two, and few people there are that can figure that one out! Can't get beyond their prejudices and fears of what's in the slime and the mud of the human psyche! But don't identify with the complexes! It's your death! Instead, relate to them.\" In this chapter, the author is one of those few who could \"figure that one out\"!"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"20 The Ritual Magic Manual David Griffin has achieved a masterpiece in this practical com- pendium of the Magician's Art, with its strong links to sound psycho- logical thinking.

The Novice as well as the Adept will herein find everything that he or she needs to prac- tice Magic immediately as well as to improve and expand his or her magical training. The present book makes the techniques of Ritual Magic more acces- sible to the general public than ever before. More than a theoretical work on Magic, this is a hands-on manual for Magical practice. The Rituals in this book integrate and present many disparate and highly interesting aspects of Ceremonial Magic, such as the correct use of Flashing Colors, Geometrical Figures, and the Assumption of God Forms. The student should begin with this introduction then read the in- troduction to each new chapter or section as he or she comes across it. The introductions frequently contain information necessary for the suc- cessful performance of the Rituals in each subsequent chapter or section. Before performing any Rituals, the student should thoroughly fa- miliarize him or herself with the Pronunciation Symbols given at the beginning of Chapter One. These symbols appear in pronunciation guidelines throughout the book and provide the student with precise pronunciation information. The student should then learn the Rites and Rituals and perform"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"22 23 The Ritual Magic Manual them in the order in which they appear. This is important for several reasons. First, the Rituals in the book appear so that the independent student will experience the Energies of the Magical Forces in the same order that they manifest during Initiation into the Rosicrucian Magi- cal Tradition. Furthermore, the Rituals in the main body of the book frequently refer to Basic Rituals found in Chapter One. In other words, success in later Rituals depends on skills learned in earlier chapters. Vibration and the Nature of Ceremonial Magic Numerous Spiritual Traditions around the world have stressed the importance of repetition, frequency, and vibration in Spiritual Disci- pline. Eastern Mystics have long understood the power of sound. One of the most important aspects of all meditative techniques is the proper use of special sounds or Mantras, repeated over and over by the medi- tating Mystic. Science as well has demonstrated that from a certain point of view everything may be considered as vibrating waves. Ceremonial Magic combines various distinct kinds of vibration. The Magician includes the vibration of physical movement through tracing geometrical figures, symbols, or sigils in the air. Simultaneously, he or she intones certain names of God, Archangels, or Angels, including thereby the vibration of sound. At the same time, the Magician visual- izes the traced figure, symbol, or sigil in his or her mind's eye, thus in- cluding mental imagery. Furthermore, he or she visualizes these im-ages in particular colors, including the vibration of color as well. Fi- nally, the special juxtaposition of Flashing (directly complementary) Colors create an even more potent vibration. This simultaneous combi- nation of numerous types of vibration in a single act has an enormous creative power, especially on the Inner Planes. Magic and Psychotherapy Israel Regardie believed that every Magician should undergo psy- chotherapy simultaneously with Initiation. For the student working outside of an Initiatic Order, psychotherapy is highly recommendable for a variety of reasons. Any Spiritual Discipline, practiced with enough discipline and persistence, will eventually bring forth powerful unconscious contents into consciousness. In the case of Ceremonial Magic, there exists a particular danger of ego inflation or in some cases even megalomania. Furthermore, whereas the solitary practitioner of Ceremonial Magic may potentially accomplish the magical aspect of Introduction Initiation independently, the psychological aspect is virtually impos- sible to complete alone.' Journal Keeping Every serious student of Magic should begin to keep a journal on a daily basis. Record any Magical Work, dreams, and visions, as well as the -\tmundane events of everyday life. Entries involving Magical Work should describe any Rituals performed, the Zodiacal2 location of the Sun and Moon, as well as a brief description of any feelings, intuitions, and observations during and following the Ritual. There are many im-portant aspects about ourselves and our magical progress discernible only in retrospect and numerous fundamental insights to gain during the process of reflection itself. If a Magician keeps a detailed journal, he or she eventually begins to discover subtle patterns of relationships un-derlying apparently random events of daily life. Magical Implements Every serious student and practitioner of Magic will eventually wish to craft and consecrate his or her own Magical Implements and craft the finest ones that he or she can. There is no need to describe the crafting and consecration of the Magical Implements of the Golden Dawn and the Rosicrucian Magical Tradition as there are already good books on the subject in print.3 The instructions given in the texts of the Rituals in the present book always mention the appropriate Magical Implements to make instruc- tions clearer for advanced Magicians and Rosicrucian Adepts. Nonetheless, with the exception of Demonic Evocation, each Ritual in this book may be performed with nothing more than the Magician's forefinger, a few items found in any kitchen cupboard, and the Enochian Tablets included in this book. Each Invocation Ritual contains a synopsis that refers to altar cloths and candles in corresponding colors, scents, and so forth. These items help to create an environment that facilitates the attainment of an altered state of consciousness in the Magician in harmony with the Ritual. Despite their usefulness, however, such environmental props should not be considered as essential to the success of a Ritual. Most Adepts and experienced Magicians are well aware of the ' See appendix V, \"Israel Regardie, The Golden Dawn, and Psychotherapy,\" for an analysis of the rocesses underlying Initiation and Psychotherapy.

Nonetheless, there is absolutely nothing that can replace the actual performance of Ceremonial Magic. A disciplined student who faithfully performs the Rituals every day armed with nothing more than an index finger will eventually make more magical progress than a highly skilled craftsman with the finest Implements who is lacking in discipline for daily Ritual Work. For those students who have already crafted and consecrated Magi- cal Implements, the texts of the Rituals appear in such a fashion as to prevent their accidental desecration. The consecration of any Magical Implement or Talisman involves its charging with Energy through Rit- ual Invocation. To avoid accidentally discharging this Force, protect the object by wrapping it in silk or linen of the appropriate color when not in use. Never allow anyone other than the Magician who charged them to handle these objects, and always put them away before ban- ishing, since Banishing Rituals serve to send away Forces attracted through Invocation. For the aforementioned reasons, the texts of the Iiituals in this book include reference to two separate Banishing Daggers; one Planetary and one Elemental.J The experienced Magician will have wondered with which Magical Force to consecrate the Banishing Dagger and how to avoid banishing its Charge. The best answer is to consecrate and use separate Elemental and Planetary Banishing Daggers. Consecrate the Elemental Banishing Dagger using Hexagrams with the Force of Gevurah, and use it to banish Pentagrams. Consecrate the Planetary Banishing Dagger using Pentagrams with the Force of Elemental Spirit, and use it to banish hexagram^.^ The beginning student may safely ignore this discussion, and banish either with an unconsecrated Dagger, or simply use his or her index finger. Channeling, Guided Fantasy, and Skrying in the Spirit Vision Skrying in the Spirit Vision is not the same thing as channeling, guided fantasy, guided meditation, nor even Pathworking as popularly understood. Unfortunately, there are numerous books of dubious quality currently in print that attempt to establish Pathworking or Enochian Orthodoxies, prescribing what one should see or experience. Such prac- 'Tradition notw~thstru?dmg, the author advises ngdit?st banlshlng with the Lotus Wand, slnce thls may inadvertently bamsh the Forrcs ~nveeted In the l.otus Wand during its consecratlot? See Chapter SIX, \"l'ractlcal and Talisrnanlc Magic,\" for more lnformatlon on Magleal Consecration tices are of questionable spiritual value, except in stimulating the imaginative faculties, and are not Skrying in the Spirit Vision. Skrying in the Spirit Vision has several distinguishing features de- spite certain commonalities with other forms of visionary experience. First, unlike channeling or spontaneous imagery, specific Forces are ceremonially invoked prior to skrying. Furthermore, the Enochian Tablets provide detailed maps of the Inner Planes. Unlike channeling or spontaneous imagery, the Magician skries to the particular Plane of specifically invoked Forces. Finally, the Magician tests each aspect of the visions. It is, after all, for good reason that the Astral Plane is called the realm of illusion as bookshelves filled with channeled ma- terial all too readily attest. After invoking the Force of the desired Plane through Ritual Invo- cation, the Magician awakens his or her imaginative and visionary faculties by briefly addressing each of the five senses before the mind's eye. Such guided fantasy may be as simple as imagining oneself lying on a beach (or in any other landscape), hearing the sound of the waves, feeling the warmth of the sun, seeing the palm trees, and smelling the scent of food being prepared nearby making one's mouth water. Most Pathworking books unfortunately never progress beyond this phase. Immediately following the awakening of the imaginative facul- ties, Skrying in the Spirit Vision frequently makes use of symbolical devices like specially colored, truncated pyramids. Such devices serve as symbolical gateways before the mind's eye as a means of spiritually entering into the Plane of the invoked Force. For most of the Rituals contained in this present volume, the Seals located at the top of each Enochian Tablet will serve this purpose quite satisfactorily. Having invoked the Force through Ritual, awakened the imagina- tive faculties, and symbolically entered the Plane of the Force, a spon- taneous vision then unfolds before the Spirit Vision of the Magician. This phase of spontaneity is of enormous spiritual value and the essence of Skrying. With practice, a skilled Skryer develops the abil- ity to suspend the rational faculties, immersing him-.or herself com-pletely in an unfolding inner drama and landscape yet skillfully test- ing every aspect of the apparition. Once the vision ends, the student should immediately record the experience. Using paint, colored markers, pens, or pencils the Magician should endeavor to briefly sketch or paint important imagery. In preparing such sketches, ignore artistic quality and focus on objectify- ing and recording any encountered symbols or imagery. Follow this by writing a detailed account of the experience before concluding the Rit-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"-- 26 The Ritual Magic Manual \tIntroduction 27 ual and banishing. Describe the surroundings, details of landscapes, and so forth, as well as any information gathered about the nature of the Plane or its inhabitants. Attempt to describe how this Plane oper- ates in the physical world, including any plants, animals, minerals, and so forth, which might correspond to the nature of the Plane. Israel Regardie published several written Skrying records of early Rosicru- cian Adepts. Although this material should not be consulted as a guide to what one \"should\" experience while Skrying, it is nonetheless useful as an example of how to keep good records6 The Magician should later attempt to interpret and analyze the imagery and events of the vision. Since the language of the unconscious and of the Inner Planes tends toward that of exaggeration and infla- tion, the student should attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff. Take nothing at face value lest one fall into ego-inflation and folly. Carefully analyze the symbols of the vision as though they were metaphors of a poem rather than literal like a work of prose. The Ma- gician should not permit anyone other than him or herself to interpret this material, however, as this inevitably brings extraneous and irrel- evant material into the interpretation. Testing Visions While Skrying The following rules for testing the veracity of visions derive from R. R. et A. C. Flying Rolls XI and XXV:7 1. Any entities encountered while skrying should immediately be tested as to their true natures. a. If the vision is that of an Elemental or Subelemental Plane, test any entities by giving the Grade Sign or Signs that correspond with the Plane in question.$ b. In all cases, the Magician may use the Neophyte (that is, the Sign of the Enterer and the Sign of Silence) and the LVX Signs. The LVX Signs serve as a particularly good, all purpose test. They will usually dispel any illusion. An entity who can return these Signs is usually trustworthy. c. \tAs a further test, Divine or Angelic Names which correspond to the particular Plane of the vision should be vibrated. The texts of all Invocation Rituals in the present book give these Names. 2. \tThe followi~~g Hebrew Letters which correspond to the seven Tradi- ' The Golifrn Duwri (7.11~ orlyrriul Aca,iint i,f tlir Teariirng~, Krtrrs, i~nd Cermtoriies of tlir Hernrutlc Order of the Goldrri Du:un) 119371,revealed by lbrael Regard~e, 6th ed.

Trace a Tauv to banish interruptions by intrusive memories. 3 Jupiter (Kaph). Trace a Kaph to banish intrusive fantasies about the future. f: \tMars (Peh). Trace a Peh to deal with aggressive entities. If one is being challenged in an aggressive fashion in a vision, tracing a Peh should calm things down. 7 \tSun (Resh). Trace a Resh to overcome ego inflation. When the in- formation one is receiving in a vision seems exaggerated or in- flated, tracing a Resh will help to ground the information and balance the interaction. 1 Venus (Daleth). Trace a Daleth to banish the intrusion of erotic fantasies as well as interference arising from one's emotions. 2 \tMercury (Beth). Trace a Beth to test the truth of statements made by an entity, to banish deceitfulness, and to eliminate any intrusive thoughts that may interrupt the vision. 3. \tMoon (Gimel). Trace a Gimel to refocus a vision. 3. \tOrdinarily, whenever a vision is interrupted the Skryer should trace the appropriate letter to banish the interruption, then trace a Gimel to refocus the vision before proceeding. Astrology and the Rosicrucian Sidereal Zodiac Before the performance of any Ritual of Astrological (that is, Plane- tary or Zodiacal) Magic, an Astrological Chart should ideally be cast for the time and the place of the Working. Fortunately for those Magi- cians with access to a computer, it has become much faster and easier in recent years to cast precise Astrological Charts. A wide array of excel- lent astrological software now enables Magicians to perform tasks with the click of a mouse that once required hours of painstaking calcu- lations to complete? Most interpretive astrologers employ the Tropical Zodiac for Chart calculations and interpretations. The Tropical Zodiac places the be- ginning, or cusp, of the Zodiacal Sign Aries at the position where the Ecliptic (the path followed by the Sun viewed from the Earth's per- spective) intersects the Equator at the time of the Vernal Equinox. This location shifts very slightly from year to year relevant to the fixed stars, however. Due to this phenomenon, known as the Precession of the 10 Edition, from Time Cycles Research, IS one such software applicahon"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"28 29 The Ritual Magic Manual Equinoxes, the Tropical Zodiac no longer corresponds to the stellar con- stellations from which the Zodiacal Signs derive their names. In Astrological Magic, the Magician works with the Energies of the Planets and of the Stars as they physically exist. When casting Charts for Magical Operations, therefore, the R. R. et A. C. has traditionally employed a Sidereal rather than a Tropical Zodiac. In the Rosicrucian Sidereal Zodiac, the Signs correspond closely to the stellar constellations from which they derive their names. The Signs and con- stellations realign by placing the beginning, or cusp, of the Zodiacal Sign Leo at the location of the fixed star Regulus. A great deal of Sidereal Astrology research during the last hundred years, however, strongly suggests that the most historically correct Zodiac (that is, the one most closely corresponding to the system once used in ancient Mesopotamia) is the Fagan-Bradley Sidereal Zodiac, which places the fixed star Regulus not on the cusp, but at five degrees, six seconds Leo. Although the latter appears to be more historically accurate, Rosicrucian Magic integrated significant material into the System based on Regulus' location on the cusp of Leo (for example, the Tree of Life in a Solid Sphere and the attribution of the Tarot to the heavens). It is therefore advisable to employ the Rosicrucian Sidereal Zodiac when casting Charts for Rituals of Astrological Magic. Those Magicians wishing to use the Rosicrucian Sidereal Zodiac should first cast Charts using the Fagan-Bradley Zodiac, then subtract five degrees and six seconds from Fagan-Bradley positions. Magic and the Tree of Life This book uses the following glyphs throughout to symbolize the Ele- ments, the seven Traditional Planets, and the twelve Signs of the Zo- diac. Glyph Element Glyph Planet Glyph Sign A V Fire Water fi 24 Saturn Jupiter y 8 Aries Taurus A Air d Mars 11 Gemini 7 Earth O Sun @ Cancer @ Spirit 9 Venus 62 Leo !2Mercury TTJ Virgo Introduction The Magical Forces attributed to the Sephiroth and to the Paths on the Qabalistic Tree of Life comprise the heart of the Rosicrucian Sys- tem of Ceremonial Magic. These Forces are Sephirothic, Elemental, and Astrological in nature. The Sepher Yetzirah, an important Hebrew mystical text, attributes the Elemental, Planetary, and Zodiacal Forces to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet and to the Tree of Life ac- cording to a different arrangement than does the Western Esoteric Tra- dition.' Nonetheless, the Tree of Life represents a view of the universe combining Greek Neoplatonic thought, Hebrew mysticism, Astrology, Alchemy, and astronomical observations from ancient Sumeria and Babylon. The notion of the Elements derives from the Neoplatonists. The Sumerians and Babylonians observed the seven Traditional Planets as luminaries wandering through the starry heavens against the back- drop of the constellations attributed to the Signs of the Zodiac. Thus ascending the Tree of Life is analogous to reaching out from the Earth through the Planets to the Stars.

Indeed Malkuth corresponds to the realm of the Elements, which is the realm of physical reality. In Rosicrucian Magic, each of the Elements corre- sponds to the angles of a Pentagram as follows. Rather than the usual Elemental Glyphs, the Glyphs for the Kerubic (or Fixed) Zodiacal Signs represent the Elements when traced inside Pentagrams traced in Ceremonial Magic. These Signs correspond to the four Kerubs seen in the vision of the Prophet Ezekial. Leo corresponds to the lion and to the Element of Fire, Scorpio to the eagle and to the Element of Water, Aquarius corresponds to the man and to the Element of Air, and Taurus to the ox and the Element of Earth. Further, Rosicru- cian Elemental Magic uses the Glyph of the eagle instead of the regu- lar Glyph for Scorpio. This is because two images are traditionally as- sociated with Scorpio; the serpent and the eagle. Whereas the former, according to tradition, represents the evil and destructive energies of Scorpio, the latter represents the sublimated and positive energies thereof. The attribution of the Elements to the angles of the Pentagram de- picts Spirit above, presiding over the remaining Elements, which cor- respond to the remaining angles in the same fashion in which they ap- pear in the various quadrants of the Enochian Elemental Tablets. These quadrants of the Enochian Elemental Tablets embody the Ener- gies of the Sub Elements. For example, on the Enochian Fire Tablet the quadrants represent the Sub Elements; Fire of Fire, Water of Fire, Air of Fire, and Earth of Fire. The Sub Element, Spirit of Fire, is repre- sented by the white colored lines in the center of the Tablet. This dis- tribution is depicted in simplified fashion in the following diagram, which is useful in understanding the arangement of the Sub Elements on each of the Enochian Elemental Tablets.'! \" The Enochian Elemental Tablets are mcluded as color ~llustratlons ~n th~s book Examining the Tree of Life illustration again, we notice six Sephiroth above Malkuth that together form the shape of a Hexagram. Tradi- tion considers Daath at the uppermost angle of this Hexagram as a \"Non-Sephirah\" (indicated with a dotted line in the Tree of Life dia- gram). In Rosicrucian Magic, the seven Traditional Planets correspond with the angles and the center of a Hexagram as follows, in the same pattern as they appear on the Sephiroth and on the Tree of Life. Sat- urn, although formally attributed to the Sephirah of Binah, within this framework nonetheless occupies the position of Daath. Thus it becomes clear that the attributions of the Elements and Planets to the angles of the Pentagram and the Hexagram are far from random. All the Invoking and Banishing Rituals in this book illustrate the cor- rect use of Pentagrams and Hexagrams in each instance. Nonetheless, an understanding of the attributions of their angles shall assist the student to comprehend the structure underlying the Rituals. Two additional rules will further assist in this regard. When work- ing with Elemental Forces, invoke by tracing the Pentagram toward the angle attributed to the Element in question, and banish away from the same angle. When working with Planetary Forces, begin to trace the Hexagram from the angle attributed to the Planet in question fol- lowed by a second Triangle traced from the angle directly opposite the first one. Always trace Hexagrams for Invocation in a clockwise direc- tion and counter clockwise to banish. One of the seven Traditional Planets rules each Zodiacal Sign.

Invoke and banish Zodiacal Forces, therefore, using ei- \"' ther Hexagrams or Pentagrams according either to the Planetary Rulership or the Elemental Triplicity of the Sign.I2 Finally, looking at the Tree of Life illustration yet again, we notice three additional Sephiroth above the six that form a Hexagram. These are known as known as the Supernal Sephiroth, unto which cor- respond the Wheel of the Zodiac and the three Alchemical Forces of Salt, Sulfur, and Mercury. Invoke and banish Sephirothic Forces with Hexagrams like Planetary Forces, beginning from the angle of the Planet associated with each Sephirah. Invoke and banish the Super- nal Sephiroth, i.e., Kether, Chokmah, and Binah, from the upper- most, Saturn angle of the Hexagram. Invoke and banish Malkuth from the lowermost, Lunar angle. Color Scales and Flashing Colors Rosicrucian Magic traditionally employs four Color Scales13 that cor- respond to the four Qabalistic Worlds, the Suits of the Tarot, the Ele- ments, and the letters of the name Jl?' as follows: Color Scale \tQabalistic Tarot Suit Element Letter of World 71Z' Kmg's Scale \tA~iluth Wands Flre Queen's Scale \tU r I 11 Cups Water 7 Prlnce Scale \tYet~lrah Swords Air 1 Prlncess Scalc \tAsslah Pentacles Earth 7 The colors attributed to the Elemental, Planetary, Zodiacal, and Sephirothic Forces represented on the Tree of Life and used in Ceremo- nial Magic combine the first two scales of color.14 The colors of the Paths on the Tree and the corresponding Forces are in the masculine, active, or King's Scale, since the Paths represent Energy in motion be- tween the Sephiroth. The colors of the Sephiroth and the correspond- ing Forces are in the feminine, passive, or Queen's Scale, since the Sephiroth represent contained Energy at rest. Rosicrucian Magic makes special use of complementary colors. Such colors, like red and green, cause an optical impression that appears to flash when placed together in juxtaposition. Such \"Flashing Colors\" have great power to attract the corresponding Magical Forces. The \"The mtroductton to the chapter SIA, bl,~g~r,\"\"Zod~ac,~l dtscusses this in greater deta~l.

Introductioiz Rituals, Talismans, and Enochian Tablets in this book all make exten- sive use the power of Flashing Colors. Scholarly Considerations Since Israel Regardie first published the Golden Dawn material in 1937, an unfortunate tendency has developed in books on Ceremonial Magic to uncritically rely on the Hierarchies of Divine Names, Archangels, Angels, Intelligences, Spirits, and Demons as published by Iicgardie. New research conducted in preparing this book has located ~)rc,-(;olden Dawn sources for nearly each of these Hierarchies. In the ~'rocc~ss,n~~merouscorruptions and misconceptions published by Re- );,~r.clic,h,~ve been either corrected or eliminated. Documentation pro- \\,icl(*~i in footnotes, introductions, and appendices shall hopefully en- ~.our,~gc. research in this arena.15 c~dditional 'l'he most reliable Names within the Hebrew Hierarchies in this book are those which include Hebrew vowel pointation. In such in- stances, pre-Golden Dawn sources were located in either Biblical or Rabbinical literature that included vowel pointation. The inclusion of pointation in these Names wherever they appear in the present book provides the scholar of Magic with information at a glance regarding the degree of reliability of Names from Hebrew Hierarchies. Fur- thermore, a native-speaking Professor of Hebrew collaborated in cor- recting all Hebrew guidelines given throughout this book. Another unfortunate and prevalent tendency in the Western Esoteric Community has been the unreflective and dogmatic application of rules set forth by S. L. MacGregor Mathers and W. Wynn Wescott concerning Enochian pronunciation. These rules can at times be quite useful phonetically, especially with names drawn from Enochian Tablets that otherwise would be impossible to pronounce. However, when rigidly applied to the Enochian Calls, these rules result in endless strings of extraneous syllables that destroy the intent and beauty of the Angelical language. For example, one recent book on the Golden Dawn transliterated the word \"Ozongon\" from an Enochian Call as \"Oh-zoad-oh-noo-goh-noo.\" In recognition of this problem, all Enochian Calls, Names, and so forth, in the present work have been retransliterated from original Enochian manuscripts. The methodology of this new transliteration in- cludes pronunciation information given by John Dee in the manuscripts l5 In this book, footnotes document~ng earlier sources are given only for the ftrst instance where a Name from each Hierarchy appears m the text."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"34 The Ritual Magic Manual themselves in addition to the Mathers-Wescott rules. Appendix I, \"The Enochian Calls\" analyzes this problem in depth and explains the complete methodology used in the new transliteration. The Vault of the Adepti The Vault of the Adepti is a highly charged magical chamber used for Ritual by the R. R. et A. C. (the Rosicrucian Order beyond the Her- metic Order of the Golden Dawn). Its symbolism is that of the burial place of Christian Rosenkreutz (Frater C. R. C.), the founder of the Rosicrucian Order. Most of the Rituals in this book may be adapted for use inside a Vault of the Adepti. Under these unusual circumstances, however, cer- tain traditional rules of the Order must be observed. According to tra- dition, an Adept should never banish, reverse circumamubulate, nor to use any form of Enochian Magic inside a Vault. Therefore the Adept should carefully modify any Ritual to omit all banishing, reverse cir- cumambulation, Enochian Calls, and names of Enochian Entities when working inside a Vault of the Adepti. This need not concern the aver- age Magician, since only Rosicrucian Adepts have access to such a Vault. Such Adepts, however, considering their years of training, should find it easy to adapt the Rituals of this book for use inside a Vault.

Pronunciation Symbols The student should thoroughly familiarize him or herself with the pronunciation symbols given below. Although the symbols are unique to this book, they appear in pronunciation guidelines in every Ritual and provide the student with more precise pronunciation information than has ever been available before in a book on Ceremonial Magic. The average student should require no more than ten or fifteen minutes to become familiar with these unique symbols. Due to the frequent use in Magic of foreign, Enochian, and unfamiliar words, the pronunciation guidlelines given in the text of the Rituals are quite helpful when performing them. In a few instances where sounds have no exact English equivalents, examples are given from other languages. For English speakers unable to pronounce these sounds correctly, their closest English equivalents should be employed until the pronunciation of the correct sounds are learned."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"37 36 \tThe Ritual Magic Manltal Vowels Symbol \tPronounce asin bother, cot, and father (as pro- nounced by most Americans) ddy, fade, date bed, bet, peck nsd, bleed, meet hit, rid, tip klte, flight, bu bone, thrown, know -up, enmgh, tough rule, fool, youth how, loud, out ba cai, destrq Shortened Vowels In Hebrew, there exist certain half-vowels that are shortened versions of usual Hebrew vowel sounds.

Use the Sign of the Enterer, also known as the Sign of Horus or the Attacking Sign, primarily to project Magical Energy. Use it in the charging of Pentagrams and Hexagrams in Ceremonial Magic and to charge Talismans in Practical Magic. To perform the sign of the Enterer, stand with your feet parallel about shoulders width apart. Visualize a star shining just above your head about the size of a baseball. Inhale silently, and visualize a shaft of white Light coming down through your body from the star above you to a second star beneath your feet. As you inhale, draw down the light and raise your elbows upward and outward, parallel with your shoulders. Hold your hands flat beside your neck, palms downward, fingers extended, pointing forwards. Suddenly and forcefully, step forward with your left foot, thrust your hands directly forward, and lower your head between your arms, eyes forward. As you do so, exhale silently, visualize the Light rising back up through your body, and project it out through your fingertips. Basic Rituals Use the Sign of Silence, also known as the Protecting Sign or the Sign of Harparcrates, for protection against any attack or to stop or seal the motion of Magical Energy. When projected with the Sign of the Enterer, Magical Current tends to rebound upon the Operator through a reflux wave. The Sign of Silence prevents this rebounding of Energy on the Inner Planes. Use the Sign of Silence, therefore, following the Sign of the Enterer to confine a Force during the Consecration of Talismans in Practical Magic.

Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. Analysis of the Key Word lntroduction This Rite centers around the letters INRI ('-I;'), which tradition says were written upon the cross of Jesus Christ as an abbreviation for Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews. There are, however, numerous other levels of occult meaning regarding these four letters UI the Rosicrucian Magical Tradition. One of these is a Hermetic secret alluded to by the Latin phrase \"Igne Natura Renovatur Integra\" which means \"By fire, nature is perfectly renewed.\" These four letters additionally adorn the rays of the angles of the Rose Cross Lamen worn by Adepts of the Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis. A deeper interpretation lies occulted behind the attributions of the Hebrew letters and the Magical Forces to the Paths on the Qabalistic Tree of Life. The Path attributed to the Hebrew letter ' is attributed to the Zodiacal Sign Virgo as well, that of ;to Scorpio, and 1to the Sun. There exist further magical associations between the Sign Virgo with the Egyptian Goddess Isis, Scorpio with Apophis, and the Sun with Osiris. When the first letter is taken from the Names of each of these Gods, the name \"IAO\" [e-S-01 is formed. Additionally due to the Signs associated with Isis, Apophis, and Osiris, they form the letters \"LVX\" [Iuks]. Basic Rituals Thus within the letters IRNI lie concealed the letters IAO and LVX, which may also be found upon the rays of the angles of the Rose Cross Lamen. The name IAO was considered by the Gnostics to be the Supreme Name of God. Its letters further allude to Salt, Sulfur, and Mercury in Alchemy and to an even more recondite secret symbolized by the relationship between Isis, Apophis, and Osiris.

Rose Cross Ritual Introduction The Rose Cross Ritual has a rather different effect than the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. It is known primarily for its calming, soothii~g, and protective qualities. Furthermore, it has been claimed by Regardie and other authorities that this Ritual does not light up the Inner Planes. Certainly, this is the case in the form which this Ritual embodies below, as it separates the different forms of vibration (that is, sound, movement, and mental imagery). Therefore, do not visualize anything while tracing the figures or projecting through them during this Ritual. Furthermore, do not vibrate Names simultaneously with movements or the tracing of lineal figures. Instead, separate each event. This Ritual stands in a certain fashion, therefore, in a class all of its own. The stage directions, although of necessity somewhat complex, are nonetheless clear. Except where otherwise specifically directed by Ritual instructions, you should always move clockwise around the Temple (as in circumambulation). Ritual 1. \tStand West of the Altar facing East. 2. \tPerform the Rite of the Qabalistic Cross (Optional). 3. \tLight a stick or cone of incense. Go to the Southeast corner of the room.

Proclaim: \"Let the Divine Light descend,\" and draw the Light down over your head to your feet. Assumption and Divestment of God Forms Introduction The Assumption of God Forms is an extremely potent adjunct to Invocation. By assuming the Form of a corresponding God or Divine Image, the Magician links personal consciousness with an aspect of his or her Higher Self (Divine Genius) harmonious with the nature of the invoked Forces. The invocation is thereby transformed. The summons no longer arises merely from the personal will and Ego of the magician. Instead, the God Form irresistibly compels the Forces to manifest with the power of a Divine Mandate. The timely divestment of all God Forms assumed during a Rttual is as important as is the proper banishing of the invoked Forces. Maintaining a sound and healthy Ego is as essential to a magician as is the ability to exalt one's consciousness. If all assumed God Forms are not properly divested prior to banishing, there is a serious risk of psychological inflation or even of megalomania developing over time. Assumption of God Forms 1. \tStudy carefully a picture or drawing of the God. Notice all details of appearance, clothing, and so forth. Familiarize yourself with the attributions of the God. Take note of the color, as well as the Flashing (complementary) Color which corresponds to the Force to be invoked. These colors are given in the text of the Rituals. 2. \tClose your eyes. In your mind's eye, build up the image of the God in front of you. It should be colossal and towering in stature. Clothe the God Form in the color appropriate to the Force you are invoking highlighted with the flashing (complementary) color. Build up all the details of the God's appearance."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"59 3. \tGive the Sign of the Enterer and, taking one step forward, enter the God Form. 4. \tAssume the God Form completely. Vibrate the Name of the God several times while you visualize the God Form enveloping your Sphere of Sensation (Aura). Identify yourself with the God. Take your time. Merge with the God, uniting your consciousness with the co~~sciousnessof the Divinity. As completely as possible, imagine yourself becoming the God. Divestment of God Forms 1. \tClose your eyes. In your mind's eye, reconnect for a few moments with the God Form which you have previously assumed. Build up the Image of the Divinity again completely enveloping your Sphere of Sensation (Aura). Notice all of the details, colors, and so forth, of the God Form. 2. \tTake one step backwards stepping out of the Image. As you do so, disidentify yourself from the God Form, separating yourself from the Image completely. 3. \tGive the Sign of Silence, and remain thus while you disperse the Image. In your mind's eye, see the God once again towering before you. Take your time, and visualize the Image slowly disintegrating and disappearing until it is completely gone. An Invocation of the Highest Divine Force Introduction No major Ritual Work should be undertaken without first performing an Invocation of the Highest Divine Force. Regardie taught that this preliminary Invocation is the single most important factor in the success or failure of any Magical Operation. In such an Invocation, the Magician summons and embodies the Highest Divine Force, also known as the Presence of God, the Higher Self, the Holy Guardian Angel, the Divine Genius, or the Daemon. Such an Invocation serves numerous functions. First of all, it exalts the consciousness of the Magician. It provides a clear transition from the mundane state of daily consciousness to the exalted state of mind required in all serious Ceremonial Work. Secondly, it brings the entire Operation under the Guidance, Direction, and Protection of the Higher Forces. Finally, it serves as a reminder of the underlying purpose of all Theurgy. All Magical activity, indeed any activity in the life of a Basic Rituals Magician, no matter how mundane, should be undertaken in cognizance of that ultimate goal, which is the completion of the Great Work. The Great Work, or the Opus Magnum, is as individual and personal as one's mundane career. However, underlying these differences there is a common goal that has variously been called the Beatific Vision of God, contact with the Higher Self, and Knowledge and Conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel. Such an Invocation is of necessity extremely personal. The Rite which follows, although it has been used with great success by the author, should not be slavishly performed. It is given only as a provisional formula, stripped of all poetic elements and symbolism which reflect the personal aspiration and psychic predisposition of the author. Of all the Rites and Ritual formulas in this book, this one must absolutely be personalized. It should come to intimately reflect the psychic predisposition of the individual Magician incorporating the symbolism which best represents the Highest Divine Force for that person. The Image of God held by a Hindu is radically different than that of a Christian or than the experience of the Higher Self of an Atheist. Yet each psyche responds to its own symbols. The following Rite of Invocation of the Highest Divine Force is adapted from The Middle Pillar Ritual combined with the Assumption of God Forms. Since it allows room for individual imagery as well as for the addition of personal symbolism, it be may used by Magicians on a provisional basis. It should be supplemented as quickly as possible with poetry or prayer selected by the each student as best representing their own individual aspiration. The student versed in Magical technology would be well advised to work this Rite only for a short time, before replacing it with one entirely of their own creation.

Rite of the Magical Eucharist Introduction This Rite should always be used prior to the Banishing of any Elementai Invocation. The form given here is that which should be used for the Supreme Irxvoking Ritual of the Pentagram. It may easily be adjusted slightly for other Invocations according to the nature of the invoked Forces. For example, in the Greater Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram for the Element of Air, one would have only the Enochian Air Tablet and the Tablet of Union in the Temple and invite only the Elemental Hierarchy of Air in each of the four Quarters to partake of the Eucharist. The invitation should always be extended, nonetheless, to partake of each of the four Elements. The Eucharist is the aspect of the Ritual which is most enjoyable for \tthe Forces thcnxselves. The Elementals (that is, Salamanders, Sylphs, Undines, and Gnomes) particularly enjoy partaking of and conxmuning with the other Elements. It is recommendable to include this Rite following the invocation of Planetary, Zodiacal, or Sephirothic Forces as well. This is due to the fact that the invisible beings which reside in these lofty realms do not have immediate access to the Elements, as do we who live on Earth (the realm of Assiah, Malkuth, and of the Elements). These invisible entities take Basic Rittrnls particular delight, therefore, in partaking of the Elements through this Rite. Synopsis Altar: Rose (East), red candle (South), cup of red wine (West), bread and salt (North). Rite 1. \tStand West of the Altar facing East. 2. \tAssume the God Form of Osiris dressed in white with yellow, blue, black, and red trim while vibrating \"Osiris\" [o-ser]. 3. \tDeclare: \"For Osiris On-Nophris, who is found perfect before the Gods hath said (point to the Altar): These are the Elements of my body, perfected through suffering, glorified through trial. For the scent of the dying rose is as the repressed sigh of my suffering and the flame red Fire as the Energy of my undaunted will. The cup of wine is as the pouring out of the blood of my heart sacrificed unto regeneration, unto newer life, and the bread and salt are as the foundations of my body which I destroy in order that it may be renewed. For I am Osiris triumphant, even Osiris On-Nophris, the justified. I am he who is clothed in a body of flesh, yet in whom is the Spirit of the great Gods. I am the Lord of life, triumphant over death. He who partaketh with me shall arise with me. I am the manifester in matter of those whose abode is in the invisible. I am purified.

When finished, drink the last drops of wine from of the cup, invert it, and place it upon the center of the Altar. Proclaim: \"Tetelestai!

Introduction Ritual Timing The ideal time to begin any Elemental Working is during an Elemental Tide corresponding to the Element of the Ritual. Except in Workings in- tended to be used for Practical Magic,' however, the importance of per- forming the Rituals outweighs all other considerations. The Elemental Tides entered the Western Esoteric Tradition through the influence of Theosophy, which called them the \"Tattwa Tides.\" The first cycle of Elemental Tides begins with Sunrise, and a fresh cycle begins every two hours. Within each one hundred twenty minute cycle, the Tide of each Element lasts for twenty-four minutes alternating in the following order: Spirit, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. Facing the Quarter of the Element There are two different allocations of the Elements to the four cardinal directions. The first allocation follows the \"nature of the winds\" which blow from these directions, and should be used for all Elemental ' See chapter slx, \"Practical and Talismanic Magic,\" for more ~riform~ttion. 67"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"68 69 The Ritual Magic Manual Invocation.

Below we see such an Astrological Chart oriented so that the cusp of Leo is on the Ascendant in the East and the Midheaven is in the South. The Kerubic Zodiacal Signs (that is, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius, and Taurus) align along the angles of the Chart in such a fashion that a Fire Sign is in the East, an Earth Sign in the South, an Air Sign in the West, and a Water Sign is in the North.

The greatest obstacle facing Egyptology in this regard, however, 1s the lack of vowels in hieroglyphics. The hieroglyphic spellings of these names appear m E. A.

Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram Introduction The Supreme Invoking fitual of the Pentagram invokes the Forces of the Tablet of Union and has two different forms. The distinction arises due to the various functions of the Tablet of Union, which rules the specific Element of Spirit (Akasha), yet generally rules all of the El- ements, in unity, as well. These two different functions of this Tablet result in two distinct forms of this Ritual, according to its intended fo- cus. When this Ritual is being employed to generally invoke all of the Elements together, it unites their Forces in balanced disposition. In this case, only the First Enochian Call should be used, and the Names and Sigils of each of the Elemental Hierarchies should be vibrated and traced in their respective Quarters. These Names and Sigils are given in the text of the Ritual. When this Ritual is being employed to invoke the specific Element of Spirit (Akasha), then the Second Enochian Call must additionally be employed. This is because the Second Enochian Call rules the spe- cific Element of Spirit. Furthermore, the Names and Sigils of the Ele- mental Hierarchies should, in this case, not be vibrated and traced in their respective Quarters. This would merely create a confusion of En- ergies, by accentuating the individual nature of each Element. The Names and Sigils of the Elemental Hierarchies should therefore, in this case, be omitted. To avoid confusion, it should be noted that the pentagrams, the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"118 119 The Ritual Magic Manual symbols in their centers, and the names vibrated while tracing them, are to be employed in all forms of this Ritual.

Introduction Ritual Timing Whenever possible, cast a Sidereal Astrological Chart for the time and place of the Ritual. It is advisable to &nploy the Rosicrucian Sidereal Zodiac when casting Charts for Rituals of Astrological Magic.' In Workings intended for Practical Magic, preferably choose a time for the Ritual when the Planet of the Working is strong in the As- trological Chart. This is particularly important when consecrating a Talisman, since the Chart of the Working additionally serves a birth chart for the Tali~man.~ The ideal time to begin any Planetary Working is during the day and the hour corresponding to the Planet in question. Except in Work-ings intended for Practical Magic, however, the importance of perform- ing the Rituals outweighs all other considerations. One might, for ex- ample, merely choose the day attributed to the Planet as the best ' See \"Astrology and the Rosicrucian Sidereal Zodiac\" in the ~ntroductlon of thls book for more znformation.

One Traditional Planet cor- responds to each of the twelve hours of the day, beginning at sunrise 6 with the Planet that rules the day. The Planets then cycle downward 7 according to the order that they correspond to the Sephiroth on the 8Tree of Life (that is, in their order of their relative motion when viewed from the Earth) as follows: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, 9 Mercury, and the Moon. The next hour begins with Saturn again, and 10 the cycles repeat until Sunrise the following day. The Planetary Hours are usually not sixty minutes long like normal hours are, however. To 11 determine the duration of Planetary Hours on a given day, divide the 12 number of minutes between Sunrise and Sunset into twelve equal parts. Each resultant is the duration of one Planetary Hour during daylight hours. Likewise divide the hours between Sunset and Sunrise into Hour twelve equal parts. Each of these parts is the duration of one nocturnal 1 Planetary Hour. The following table resumes the Planets that rule each Planetary Hour. Facing the Planet At a certain point in Planetary Invocation Rituals, the Magician should face the location of the Planet to perform additional Invoca- tions. When avoidable, the Magician may simply face East to perform this aspect of the Ritual. Magicians having cast a Sidereal Astrologi- cal Chart for the time and place of the Working have better options, however, due to information revealing the actual spatial location of the Planet. Traditionally, the correct method to \"face the Planet\" during a Rit-ual has remained a symbolical one, by orienting the Astrological Chart upon the Altar so that the Ascendant faces East, and that the Midheaven faces South. The Magician then faces away from the Altar in the direction indicated by the location of the Planet in the Chart.

Vertically orient the Chart, so that the Ascendant faces East and the Midheaven faces straight up above the Altar, to determine the location of the Planet in the sky. For even greater precision, make a further adjustment slightly North or South of this position according to the present Declination of the Planet. This information is readily available in any astrological ephemeris or in Charts cast with a computer using good astrological software. Magical Implements Remember that performing the Rituals on a regular basis outweighs all other cox~siderations. Those Magicians not in possession of consecrated Magical Implements should simply use their hands or index fingers, to- gether with Enochian Tablets from this book, and a few items from the kitchen. Rosicrucian Adepts have traditionally employed the Lotus Wand as the Magical Implement of choice for Planetary, Sephirothic, and Zodiacal Invocation. The Lotus Wand therefore appears in the text of the Planetary Rituals. The Phoenix Wand, however, is actually more suitable to Planetary Invocation, since its seven colored sections corre- spond to the seven Ancient Planets. To use the Phoenix Wand in Plane- tary Magic, hold it by the colored band attributed to the Planet of the Working. The twelve colored bands that divide the Lotus Wand correspond to the twelve Signs of the Zodiac. There are several means of correctly employing the Lotus Wand in Planetary and Sephirothic Invocation. The Magician may hold the Lotus Wand by the white section for gen- eral Invocation, for sephirothic influences, and for matters of a divine or spiritual nature. The student may also hold the Lotus Wand by the colored band attributed to the Sidereal Sign where the Planet of the Working is currently located. Finally, he or she may hold the Lotus Wand by the band of one of the Zodiacal Signs ruled by the Planet, ac- cording to a traditional system of Diurnal and Nocturnal Signs. Day and Night Houses of the Planets Israel Regardie published the correspondences of the seven Traditional Planets ruling the Diurnal and the Nocturnal Zodiacal Signs in 1937 with several significant errors. The frequent republishing of Regardie's errors by subsequent authors has resulted in decades of incorrect magi- cal practice. The rulership of the Signs by the seven traditional Plan- ets as well as their Diurnal or Nocturnal nature was apparently first Planetary Magic published by Claudius Ptolomy in tetra bib lo^,^ an important text in the history of Astrology. A careful examination of the following illus- tration will clarify the origin of these attributions. The Moon and the Sun, which rule over Cancer and Leo, the first and the warmest Signs of Summer, sit at the top of the Zodiacal Wheel. Planetary Rulership of the remaining Signs then descends the Wheel symmetrically according to the relative motion of the Planets viewed from the Earth, and beginning with Mercury at the top and ending with Saturn at the bottom. The Signs on the left side of the wheel, with Leo and the Sun, are the Diurnal Signs or \"Day Houses of the Planets.\" The Signs on the right side of the chart, with Cancer and the Moon, are the Nocturnal Signs or \"Night Houses.\" Leo serves as both Day and Night House of the Sun, and Cancer serves the same for the Moon since these two luminaries rule only one Sign each. The following table resumes these ideas and lists the Signs of the Detriment, Exaltation, and Depression of the Planets.

The le- gitimate criteria to evaluate growth and further development in the R. R. et A. C. system are: whether said developments are logically con- sistent, whether they follow similar lines of synthesis as those used during the nineteenth century, and whether or not they are magically effective. The Rituals in this chapter integrate Enochian material into Plane- tary Magic along the same lines that Elemental Magic integrated sim- ilar material in the last century. The Enochian Planetary tablet^,^ their attributions, and the Enochian Calls complete this integration. For a detailed analysis of the attributions of the Names and Squares of the Enochian Planetary Tablets, as well as the Planetary attribution of the Enochian Calls, see Appendix 11: The Book of the Concourse of Plaizetary and Zodiacal Forces. A thorough study of this material shall prove of great value to the Magician. Regarding the Planetary Hierarchy of Divine and Angelical Names, new research has revealed the traditional distinction between Sephirothic and Planetary Hierarchies to be false. The correct distinc- tion lies rather between Sephirothic and Kameothic Hierarchies. In the \"Planetary\" Hierarchy, the Divine Names are those of the Sephi- rothic Hierarchy, whereas the names of the Planetary Intelligences and Spirits derive from a system of Magic Squares called the Kameoth. All that remains of the \"Planetary\" Hierarchy are the so-called Archangels of the Planets, spelled in most modern sources as: Cassiel, Sachiel, Zamael, Michael, Anael, Raphael, and Gabriel. Interest- ingly, of all the Hierarchies, these \"Archangels\" are the only entities ' Included as color illustrat~ons m this book. Planetary Magic whose Names Regardie does not give in Hebrew. Furthermore, the He- brew spellings given by Aleister Crowley for these Names in 7776are completely inaccurate, likely representing a retransliteration into He- brew of the English transliteration given by Regardie. Various versions of Sepher ~atziel, an important Jewish magical text, clearly demonstrate the origin of the these Names in the Sephi- rothic Hierar~hy.~ Interestingly, the names of the Archangels Michael and Raphael are not always transposed in the various versions of the Sepher Raziel manuscripts as the) are in the \"Planetary\" Hierarchy. Furthermore, earlier manuscripts indicate that the notion itself of a \"Planetary\" Hierarchy likely originates as a Qabalistic adaptation of an earlier system of Planetary Magic, apparently Chaldean in rig in.^ Once restored to correct Hebrew spellings, it becomes clear that the names of this Hierarchy are indeed not \"Archangelic\" in nature at all.9 For example, when correctly spelled in Hebrew, the name of the \"Archangel\" of Mars is in reality the arch-demon Samael (?NQo).'O With one notable exception, most of the other names of this Hierarchy are virtually identical with the Archangels of the Sephirothic Hier- archy. Interestingly, the name \"sachiel\" given by Regardie as the \"Archangel of Jupiter\" comprises but a corrupt translitration of the Name of the Sephirothic Archangel of Chesed, \"~zad~iel\" (?K'?-T~). It seems likely that the Planetary Hierarchy originated when early Qabalists wished to adapt a yet earlier system of Planetary Magic for Qabalistic use. In the earlier system, the entities are of a na- ture similar to the characteristics attributed to the Planets in tradi- tional Astrology. The creators of the Qabalistic Hierarchy apparently replaced the names from the earlier magical system with the names of Archangels drawn from the corresponding Sephiroth on the Tree of Life. The Malefic Planets, Mars and Saturn, presented a unique problem, however, since Sephirothic Archangels could not adequately represent their destructive energies. The Qabalists therefore attributed the De- mon Samael to Mars. For Saturn, they found a classical Qabalistic so- b Aleister Crowley, 777 and Other Qabalistic Writings, ed.

They permuted the Name of the Archangel of Binah, Tza- phquiel (5K73fl~), by exchanging its first and third letters, Tzaddi (X) and Qoph (p). The resultant permutation, Qaphtziel (h'X93), ade- quately represented the malefic energies of Saturn. Apparently, igno- rant scribes later corrupted Qaphtziel through transliteration into \"Cassiel,\" the form in which Regardie published this name and au- thors have copied and republished it ever since. In conclusion, the Planetary Hierarchy previously employed by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn should no longer be used. Instead, Iiosicrucian Magic must henceforth distinguish between Sephirothic and Kameothic, rather than Sephirothic and Planetary Hierarchies. Therefore, when performing Planetary Invocation, Magicians should first invoke the Divine Name, Archangel, and Angel from the Sephi- rothic Hierarchy, followed by the Kameothic Planetary Intelligence. In Magical Evocation, the Magician would follow this with an Evoca- tion of the Kameothic Planetary Spirit.\" Never invoke the Kameothic Spirits, however, since their nature is clearly demonic.

Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Hexagram Introduction The Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Hexagram invokes the combined Forces of the Planets in balanced disposition. The following version of this Ritual invokes the Forces of the Planets in the descending order of their relative motions when viewed from the Earth. This is identical with the order they appear on the Tree of Life, and they correspond to the letters of the seven-lettered name Araritha (MZ'lWlK). The fol- lowing version of this Ritual is primarily for use inside the Vault of the Adepti, and its form derives from the disposition of the Planets in the Vault, as illustrated below.25 When the Ritual is being performed inside the Vault, all Banishing, reverse Circumambulation, and the Enochian Call should be omitted. It is traditional to never banish any- thing nor to use Enochiana inside the Vault. A good alternative version would be to invoke the Planets according to increasing vibratory frequency of the colors which correspond to them in the King's Scale (that is, in the order of the walls of the Vault). The Magician should eventually experiment with both ver-sions. 2s Note that the orientations given within the text of this Ritual are not always preclse, due to the difficulty of d~viding a Heptagram and a Triangle illto the directions usually assoc~ated with a compass The Magician should therefore make frequent reference to this illustration when perforirung this Btual."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"215 The \tRitual Magic Manual WNW WSW W Synopsis Altar: \tWhite Altar cloth, candle, incense, cup of water, Lotus (or Phoenix) Wand (wrapped), Planetary Banishing Dagger, materials for the Rite of the Magical Eucharist (optional).

Introduction Pentagrams vs. Hexagrams The Zodiacal Rituals in this chapter employ Greater Invoking and Banishing Rituals of the Pentagram. Under most circumstances, this is a satisfactory method of Invocation, since each Sign of the Zodiac has an affinity with the Elements known in Astrology as Elemental Trip- licity. Each Zodiacal Sign has an additional affinity, however, with one of the seven Traditional Planets according to the Planetary Ruler- ship of each Sign.' To emphasize the Planetary, rather than the Elemental, nature of the Sign, the Magician may therefore alternatively invoke Zodiacal Forces by employing Greater Invoking and Banishing Rituals of the Hexagram for the Planet ruling the Sign. The Invocation of Zodiacal Forces inside the Vault of the Adepti is one example where Hexagrams would be more appropriate. Hexagrams are preferable in the Vault due ' See \"Day and Night Houses of the Planets\" 111 the introduction to chapter three, \"l'lanciary Rituals,\" for a d~scussion of Pl'metary Rulership"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"260 261 The Ritual Magic Mlznual to its Planetary nature, since the Forces in this highly charged magical chamber reflect through its seven Planetary walls. Trace the Hexagrams in the King's Scale color attributed to the Zo- diacal Sign, with the Sign's glyph traced in its center in the Flashing Color. The colors used in the Pentagram Rituals in this chapter are cor- rect. Employ the Names and Sigils from the Zodiacal Hierarchy in the same fashion as included in the Pentagram Iiituals in this chapter. The correspondences between the Signs of the Zodiac, their Planetary Rulers, and the Elemental Triplicities are as follows: Sign Planetary Elemental Ruler Triplicity v 6 a 8 0 B Zodiacal Magic The ideal time to begin any Zodiacal Working using Hexagram Rit- uals is during the day and the hour corresponding to the Planet ruling the Sign,\" and either during the hours of the day or of the night, de- pending on whether the Sign is Diurnal or Noct~rnal.~ The ideal time to begin any Zodiacal Working using Pentagram Iiituals is during an Elemental Tide6 that corresponds to the Element of the Triplicity of the Sign. An alternative excellent time for all Zodiacal Invocation is when the Sign is ascending in the East, as determined by the Sidereal Astrological Chart. Except in Workings intended to be used for purposes of Practical Magic, however, the importance of performing the Rituals outweighs all other considerations. Facing the Sign At a certain point in Zodiacal Invocation Rituals, the Magician should a:!2A \tface the location of the Sign to perform additional Invocations.

In Workings intended to be used for Practical Magic, preferably choose a time for the Ritual when the Planet of the Working is strong in the AS- trological Chart. This is particularly important when consecrating a Talisman, since the Chart of the Working serves as a birth chart for the Talisman.\" :Scc '.4strology an3 thc Kos~cruclan Sldereal Zodlac\" In the introduction of this book for more 1nturm.ltlon' 5ec ch'lpter six, \"l'ractical and Talisrndnis htagic,\" for more lnformatioli on Talisma~is and on L<rdi,icai ll~giilty South, Air in the West, and Water in the North (When using the Rite of the Magical Eucharist in Rituals of Zodiacal Invocation, likewise orient and arrange the Elements upon the Alta~).~ Magicians having cast a Sidereal Astrological Chart for the time and place of the Work- ing have better options, however, due to information revealing the spatial location of the Sign. Traditionally, the correct method to \"face the Sign\" during a Ritual has remained a symbolical one, by orienting the Astrological Chart upon the Altar so that the Ascendant faces East and that the Mid- heaven faces South. The Magician then faces away from the Altar in the direction indicated by the location of the Sign in the Chart. An additional excellent alternative exists during the hours when the Sign is above the horizon.

For even greater precision, make a further adjustment slightly North or South of this position according to the present Declination of the Sun. This final adjustment is necessary since the Zodiacal Constellations lie along the Ecliptic, the path apparently followed by the Sun when viewed from the Earth. The Ecliptic begins due East only at time of the Equinoxes, when it intersects with the Equator. The Declination of the Sun shows the current degree of variance between the Ecliptic and the Equator. This information is available in any astrological ephemeris or in Charts cast with a computer using good astrological software. Spirit Pentagrams When using I'entagrams for Zodiacal Invocation, some Magicians have traditionally preferred to precede each Zodiacal Invoking Pentagram with a Spirit Invoking Pentagram as is done in Elemental Invocation. Magicians who prefer this practice may add this step to the Rituals in this Chapter. It should first be considered, however, that the Signs of the Zodiac belong to an entirely different and more exalted Plane than do the Elements. While the Elements come under the presidency of Spirit, the Signs of the Zodiac come rather under the presidency of the Supernal Sephiroth and correspond with the Sephirah of Chokmah. New Developnlents in Zodiacal Magic The Rituals in this chapter integrate Enochian material into Zodiacal Magic along the same lines that Elemental Magic incorporated similar material in the last century. The Enochian Zodiacal Tablet: its attri- butions, and the Enochian Calls complete this integration. For a de- tailed analysis of the attributions of the Names and Squares of the Enochian Zodiacal Tablet, as well as the Zodiacal attribution of the Enochiarl Calls, see appendix 11, \"The Book of the Concourse of Plane- tary and Zodiacal Forces.\" Although unnecessary to perform the Ritu- als in this chapter, a thorough study of this appendix shall prove of great value to the Magician. * li~cludedas a color ~llushat~on book.in th~s Zodiacal Magic Greater Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram, Pisces Synopsis Altar: \tRed-violet Altar cloth, candle, incense, cup of wa- ter, Lotus Wand (wrapped), Elemental Banishing Dagger, materials for the Rite of the Magical Eu- charist (optional).

Until the present, however, the application of these Forces to Practical Magic has not been discussed. Although each Ritual of the main body of the present work includes a Magical Intention within its structure, these Intentions have so far been limited to the development of the Sphere of Sensation (\"Aura\" or \"Energy Body\") of the Magician, together with the stated aspiration to come into ever greater contact with the source of wisdom and guidance frequently referred to as the Divine Genius or Holy Guardian Angel. The subject of Practical Magic has deliberately been postponed until the later chapters of the present work to counteract prevalent miscon- ceptions about the function and aim of Magic. The primary purpose of Magic in the Rosicrucian Tradition is personal and spiritual develop- ment, rather than the mere ability to cause things to happen in the ex-"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"524 525 The Ritual Magic Man~lal ternal world. Although the Adept indeed develops formidable skills in this latter arena, such abilities are merely byproducts of Initiation or magical discipline, rather than their primary aim. Initiation into any genuine Magical Order or Tradition inevitably includes magical as well as psychological aspects. Appendix V, \"Israel Regardie, The Golden Dawn, and Psychotherapy\" demonstrates that, from a psychological perspective, genuine self initiation is virtually impossible. Nonetheless, under certain circumstances the solitary stu- dent can indeed accomplish the magical function of Initiation through discipline and persistence in the practice of Ceremonial Magic. The magical aims of Initiation are the systematic awakening of certain Forces in the Sphere of Sensation (\"Aura\" or \"Energy Body\") of the student, and the strengthening thereof. The Adept over time learns to embody, transmit, and direct ever in- creasing amounts of Magical Current. There has been a great deal of misunderstanding regarding Magical Current, the Energy known in Rosicrucian Magic as LVX [lux]. More than an intellectual idea, this Energy is as physically real as electricity or fire and can be felt within and flowing through the body. Furthermore, LVX is the Force with which the Magician invests his Magical Weapons and Talismans dur- ing their consecration. Practical Magic For the purposes of Practical Magic, Elemental Magic serves primarily to create direct effects in external reality. Astrological Magic facili- tates personal development. Sephirothic Magic is useful for spiritual development as well as for the attainment of certain mystical states. The Planets in Astrology traditionally represent particular psycho- logical drives, urges, and motivations.' Thus Practical Planetary Magic assists the development and transformation of the personality. The Signs of the Zodiac astrologically represent twelve qualities of being or attitudes toward life? Thus Practical Zodiacal Magic serves to transform the way we interact with the world around us. Finally, the Astrological Houses \"bring the chart down to earth, serving as the lens to focus and personalize the planetary blueprint onto the actual landscape of life, and dividing that landscape into twelve categories of e~perience.\"~ The Houses corresponding to the Zodiacal Signs like- ' Sasyortas. Howarii. Tlx Tiwl~~' IIJ the Houses IIINol~res. All Introdi~cf~ori Astrologrcal intrrprefafron (London Aquarlnii, IY65), p. 19'bid Ibld Practical and Talismanic Magic wise bring Zodiacal Magic down to earth, enabling the Magician to create change in external reality in the fields of experience represented by the Houses. In Zodiacal Magic, the Houses exactly correspond to the Zodiacal Signs, as they do in the Natural Zodiac (that is, with the first degree of Aries on the Ascendant, the first degree of Taurus on the cusp of the second house, the first degree of Gemini on the cusp of the third house, and so forth).\" The Elements operate in the lowest of the four Qabalistic Worlds (called Assiah) and in the lowest of the ten Sephiroth (Malkuth). Since these are the realms wherein we live in the physical world, the Elemental Forces serve directly to create change in physical reality. The Magician wishing to magically cause effects in the external world will therefore find the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram the single most important Ritual at his or her disposition. Indeed this Rit- ual can accomplish such amazing results that numerous aspiring Magi- cians never progress beyond it, or beyond a variation thereof. Such Ma- gicians, however, are like those misguided alchemists whose exclusive aim is to make gold. Whether the Magician chooses Elemental, Planetary, Zodiacal, or Sephirothic Forces with which to manifest a particular Magical In- tention is largely a question of discrimination. The categories listed at the end of the chapter will be of great assistance in this regard. For example, let us assume that a Magician needs money. The Supreme In- voking Ritual of the Pentagram would be a good first choice to manifest anything in the physical environment, since it invokes the combined Forces of the Elements, and since everything on the Earth contains a combination of each of the Elements. After consulting the categories given at the end of this chapter, however, the Magician could quickly ascertain that several additional options exist. An examination of these various possibilities shall serve to illustrate the primary differences between Elemental, Planetary, and Zodiacal Magic. Upon examining the categories, the Magician first notices that the Element of Earth rules money and material matters. Should the Magi- cian choose to work elementally, the desired result could most effec- tively be achieved by performing two separate Workings. The Supreme Invoking and Ritual of the Pentagram followed by the Greater Invoking and Ritual of the Pentagram for Earth would be an effective combination. The Magician would notice as well, however, that the Zodiacal Sign of Taurus rules materialism and that the corresponding Second House rules money. Whereas he or she might most readily"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"- - 526 527 The Ritual Magic Manual produce the funds by using Elemental Forces, the student could additionally transform and develop his or her relationship to money and materialism by employing the Forces the Zodiacal Sign of Taurus together with those of the Second House. Furthermore, the Magician could choose to work planetarily, and to transform his or her urge to safety and security with a Saturn Working, or urges as related to money and prosperity through a Jupiter Working. Flashing Tablets and Talismans Rosicrucian Magic has traditionally used Flashing Tablets or Talis- mans as focal objects for Planetary, Zodiacal, and Sephirothic Forces, when employing these Energies for Practical Magic. Such a physical link is necessary, since the Planets and the Zodiacal Signs are at- tributed to Sephiroth and Paths above Malkuth on the Tree of Life, and above Assiah in the four Qabalistic Worlds. Furthermore, the Sephiroth themselves belong to a loftier Spiritual Plane than do the Elements. A complete set of such Talismans appear as color illustrations in this book. These Talismans bring together various aspects of the R. R. et A. C. System, which include the employment of geometrical figures and colors corresponding to Magical Forces. Each corresponding color appears together with its contrasting or \"flashing\" color. This flashing effect is conducive to the attraction of the corresponding Magical Force to the Talisman. Polygons and the colors of the Queen's Scale appear in Talismans for the Forces attributed to the Sephiroth, since they best reflect the passive or receptive nature of the latter. Polygrams and the colors of the King's Scale appear in Talismans for the Forces attributed to the Paths on the Tree of Life, as these best reflect their active or outflowing nature. The Talismans in this book further include Names of God, Archangels, Angels, Intelligences, Spirits, Qlippoth, and Spheres, to- gether with Sigils for these Names. The Names of the Qlippoth and other Averse Forces appear on these illustrations only so that they may additionally be used as Lamens for the Magical Evocati~n.~ It is best not to include these Names on Talismans. The student should employ the illustrations as a guide to construct his or her own Talismans for Practical Magic. The crafting of Talis- mans entails more than mere preparation, being essential to the Ritual, and should be conducted with great solemnity. Take great care in See chapter seven, \"Dernon~c Evocntlon;' for more ~nforrnatlon Practical and Talismanic Magic selecting of the brightest possible colors, as well as in tracing the Sig- ils. Ceremonial Formula of Magical Consecration The Ceremonial Formula for the Consecration of Talismans is used in the Rituals for the Consecration of the Elemental Weapons and Magic Sword published by Israel Regardie.6 Regardie sometimes used the Middle Pillar Ritual to consecrate Talismans as well, and elsewhere describes an additional means of Consecration according to the Neo- phyte F~rmula.~ To consecrate a Talisman by the Ceremonial Formula, first invoke the respective Forces, then charge the Talisman with them. Place the Talisman on the Altar at the point of the Ritual following the Magical Intention. Trace and visualize a circle of white Light around it to confine the Force. Repeatedly project Magical Current into it using the Sign of the Enterer immediately followed by the Sign of Silence. The Sign of the Enterer projects the Current, and the Sign of Silence pre- vents the Force from bouncing back on the Magician. Next perform ad- ditional Invocation directly over the Talisman, repeating the appro- priate Invoking Pentagram or Hexagram, then retracing the respective Names and Sigils. Project additional Magical Current into the Talis- man as before. Finally, purify it with water and consecrate it with fire, then wrap the Talisman in silk or linen of the corresponding color and put it away before banishing. Dignity of the Planets and the Signs Always determine the Dignity of the Planet or the Sign of the Ritual before consecrating an Astrological Talisman. The Dignity of a Planet is determined by its strength in the Sign where it is located, together with aspects it makes with other Planets at the time of the working8 Although of lesser importance, aspects made by the Planet with cer- tain angles of the Astrological Chart are significant as well, particu- larly with the Ascendant and the Midheaven. A Planet is strongest in the Signs that it Rules, strong in the Sign of its Exaltation, weak in the Sign of its Depression, and weakest in the \" The Golden Dawn (Thr orrgrnul Acco~rt~t of the Teachtnx5, R~tes, and Cerernon~es uf the Hrrmetrc Order of tile Gullfen Dazun) [1937], revealed by Israel Regardle, Slxth ed (St Paul Llewellyn, 1989). pp 317-328-'Ibid., pp. 384.387. 413-422.

Likewise, in simplest terms, a Planet is strongest when it is Conjunct (o),strong when Trine (A), weak when Square (U), and weakest when in Opposition (2)with another Planet. Two Planets are Conjunct when they are together in an Astrological Chart, Trine when they are one hundred and twenty degrees apart, Square when they are ninety degrees apart, and in Opposition to one another when they are one hundred and eighty degrees apart. Astrology traditionally allows about five degrees variance in these mea-surements while still considering the Aspects to be valid. Likewise Zodiacal Signs are strongest when occupied by Planets that rule them, strong when occupied by Planets in their Exaltation, weak when occupied by Planets in their Detriment, and weakest when occupied by Planets in their Depression. Aspects made by any Planet occupying the Sign, of course, additionally affect its Dignity. Always cast, therefore, a Sidereal Astrological Chart for the time and place of the Ritual. This is particularly important in works of Tal- ismanic Magic, since the Chart becomes the Birth Chart of the Talis- man.

Introduction Magical Evocation Magical Evocation of the Averse Forces is the most feared, maligned, and misunderstood aspect of Ceremonial Magic. Interestingly, it is one of the most potentially valuable as well. Many readers will wonder what, if anything, Demonic Evocation has to do with the Golden Dawn or with Rosicrucian Magic. Indeed, many Rosicrucian Adepts have no idea how or where this aspect of Magic fits into the System, even though they have stood upon the Names of the Qlippoth on the floor of the Vault of the Adepti. The knowledge that follows in this chapter was once reserved exclusively for Rosicrucian Adepts who not merely had attained the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel but had risen with Osiris in the Tomb of Frater CRC as well, thus attaining the strength of Gevurah.' Indeed, the work of the Sword is the work of the Major Adept, and all others should fear, shun, and avoid it.

Evocation to Visible Appearance is an extremely powerful form of Ritual, designed primarily for working with the Averse Forces in a safe and sane fashion. S. L. MacGregor Mathers spent a great deal of time studying and translating Magical Grimoires including the Greater Key of the Lesser Key of Solomon3 (also known asSolon~o11,~ the L.smrgeton), the GriiTioire of Ar~rtadeI,~and the Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melitz Israel Regardie contended that the the h/l~ge.~ Magical Grimoires contain the remnants of an ancient form of Psychol- ogy, although in a greatly corrupted form. This corruption is likely due to the official condemnation of Magic in all its forms by the Christian Church during the Middle Ages. Thus the repressive paradigm preva- lent in Europe during the Middle Ages degraded the ancient and sacred science of Theurgy into the vulgar Sorcery of the Grinloires and cor- rupted its sublime aims into the puerile desires of its guilt-instilled and greedy practitioner^.^ At the close of the Twentieth Century, as well as of the Millennium, we live under very different conditions than did the Magicians of earlier times. Science has greatly diminished the power of Dogma to determine how we see the world, and Psychology has emerged to fill the role once played by Theurgy. We live in an age of religious toler- ance, wherein Christians may again begin to embrace the value of Magic. Indeed, Christ the Magus is the ideal of Christian Magicians. Let the intolerant and the self-righteous remember that the religious leaders of his day accused Christ himself of evil magic, of commanding demons by the power of the Prince of Demons. Hierarchies of Demons An important obstacle to overcome in the practice of Magical Evocation is the difficulty to find a suitable Hierarchy of Averse Forces. The Hi- erarchies in most of the Grimoires are hopelessly corrupt, largely due to the practice of young religions to demonize Gods and Angels from the 'Clizo~crrln Soli~rr~o!zrs. trans. and ed. S L.

Demonic Evocatiolz pantheons of pre-existing and contemporaneous spiritual traditions. For example, Baal and Astarte, the great God and Goddess of the Caananites, appear diabolized in the infernal Hierarchy of the Goe- tia in the Lemegeton as the demons Beelzebub and Asteroth. Other Grimoires even include Isis, the sublime Mother Goddess of Egypt, as one of the denizens of Hell. Fortunately, however, the Hierarchies of Forces attributed to the Qabalistic Tree of Life by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn provide a perfect vehicle for Magical Evocation. These Hierarchies descend through all four of the Qabalistic Worlds and onward into the Realm of the Averse Forces. Unto Aziluth, the Highest of the four Qa- balistic Worlds corresponds a Divine Name attributed unto each Sephirothic, Zodiacal, Planetary, and Elemental Force. Likewise, unto Briah, the next descending World, corresponds the Name of an Archangel, and unto Yetzirah, the name of an Angel or Choir of Angels presiding over each of the Forces. Unto Assiah, the lowest Qabalistic World corresponds a Name for the Sphere of the operation of each Force, and in the Infernal realm beyond Assiah corresponds the Name of an Averse Force. Thus we find in the Tree of Life an excellent model and vehicle for use in Magical Evocation. Preparation for Evocation Magical Evocation of the Averse Forces is one of the most perilous tasks an Adept must undertake. Within the initiatic framework of the R. R. et A. C., the Initiate should not undertake work of Evocation until the 6=5 Grade of Adeptus Major. As a Minor Adept, the Magician at length achieves the Knowledge and Conversation with his or her Holy Guardian Angel (also known as Divine Genius) and progressively invokes the Forces of the Tree of Life through the Subgrades. Only then, having grown into the full consciousness of Tiphareth and contact with the Divine and Angelical Forces, is the Adept ready to strive to achieve the strength of Gevurah. The Magical Weapon attributed to Gevurah is the Magic Sword, and the primary magical task of the Adeptus Major is the confrontation with the Averse Forces. Before advancing to the Compassion and Love of Chesed, the Adept must first fully integrate the Strength of Gevurah by reworking the Forces of the Tree of Life, Sephirah by Sephirah through Gevurah in the 6=5 Subgrades of Adeptus Major. The Major Adept must therewith evoke, constrain, and subdue each of the Averse Forces. In the R. R. et A. C., the initiatic Rites of the Order, a rigid regimen of Magical Invo-"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"548 The Ritual Magic Manual Demonic Evocation 549 cation, and significant self-abnegation together prepare the Adept for this perilous undertaking. Without such formal preparation, the solitary practitioner should by some means or another first have come into the fullness of the Knowledge and Conversation with his or her Holy Guardian Angel. The student should have additionally successfully invoked and ban- ished each of the Divine, Archangelical, and Angelical Forces in the Rituals of this book before setting out to evoke, constrain, and subdue any of the Averse Forces. Should this not be the case, the solitary practitioner should leave Magical Evocation strictly alone. Evocation is not a game to toy with, but a dangerous undertaking even for a Major Adept. The result of ignoring this warning could be spiritual disaster, ruin, obsession, or even psychosis. Psychology and Evocation One may best understand the function of Magical Evocation within Rosicrucian Magic from a psychological perspective. Modern psychol- ogy offers the Magician important insight into processes known to Theurgists for thousands of years. The notion of the Unconscious, an as- pect of the psyche lying beneath the threshold of conscious awareness, provides new insight into the nature of the Entities previously under- stood as Demons. Israel Regardie suggested that: \"The term 'complex' has achieved a fairly wide notoriety during the last quarter century since the circulation of the ideas of Freud and Jung. It means an aggre- gation or group of ideas in the mind with a strong emotional charge, capable of affecting conscious thought and beha~ior.\"~ Living in the dark realm beyond the light of consciousness, the complexes enjoy a sort of semi-autonomy within the psyche. Whether the Magical Forces, Angels, and Demons exist objectively or rather merely subjectively within the psyche of the Magician is an epistemological question that goes beyond the scope of the present dis- cussion. For practical purposes, it is quite useful to consider the Forces at times as though they were objective and in other instances to treat them as though they were purely subjective psychic contents of the Magician. This is not dissimilar to the scientific understanding of light. We may best understand certain properties of light by consider- ing it as a wave and others by considering light as a particle. We may thus gain new insight into the nature of Demons by consid- ering the Averse Forces as subjective Forces within the Psyche of the Magician. These complexes exist beyond the threshold of consciousness, beyond the light of reason so to speak, in the darkness of the psyche. In Qabalistic terms, the four Worlds of Aziluth, Briah, Yetzirah, and Assiah, with their corresponding Gods, Archangels, and Angels are Forces of Light. They exist in the Light of consciousness. The Averse Forces, Qlippoth, Spirits, and Demons are unconscious Forces, which exist in the dark realm beyond our conscious awareness. Indeed, the Demons are but the \"Shadows of the Gods.\" A lotus flower opens gracefully in the light, but its root grows in the dark slime beneath the water. Each of the Forces attributed the Tree of Life may be likened to a lotus flower. The Divine Names, Archangels, Angels, and Spheres corresponding to each Force are like the petals of the lotus, bathing in the light of consciousness. The corresponding Qlip- poth, Spirits, and Demons are the root of the lotus growing in the dark slime. The Gods, Archangels, and Angels are rational or conscious Forces. The Averse Forces comprise the dark, non-rational, frequently repressed, instinctual, and emotive counterparts of the same. These Dark Forces exert a great power over consciousness. They move us instinctually, emotionally, and frequently completely unob- served and unnoticed. Who has not experienced being \"carried away\" by a strong emotion, like anger, which colors consciousness temporarily with nearly irresistible power? Who has not said, at one time or an- other, \"I just don't know what came over me?\" Indeed, unconscious Forces play a far more active and fundamental role in day-to-day life then we are normally aware. They manifest autonomously, in response to stimuli in the environment, and independently of our will and awareness. It is the task of the Major Adept to grow in awareness of, to make conscious, and to master these Forces. From this perspective, Magical Evocation bears a certain resem- blance to the process of psychotherapy, since it involves the bringing of unconscious contents to light. By evoking the Averse Forces into the Triangle of Art, the Magician brings them into the light of conscious- ness, virtually comes to see them, and attempts learn about their na- ture, function, and mode of operation in the process. Before the Evocation, this had remained completely unconscious or, so to speak, in the darkness. With time, the Adept learns to quickly recognize these Forces whenever they manifest in his or her day-to- day life and to direct their operation to the service of greater psychic unity and harmony. As Israel Regardie put it: \"No longer are they [the Demons] independent spirits roaming the astral world, or partial sys- tems roaming the unconscious, disrupting the individual's conscious Israel iirgardic, The Apt ar:J Meai?irrg i,fMagtc (Toddington: Helios, 1964), p. 32"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"551 life. They are brought back once more into the personality where they become useful citizens so to speak, integral parts of the psyche, instead of outlaws and gangsters, grievous and dangerous enemies threatening psychic unity and integrity.\"$ It is frequently easier to recognize the manifestation of these Forces in retrospect rather than during their manifestation moment-to-mo- ment. These processes are very subtle and extremely easy to overlook. The Magical Diary or Journal is therefore an important tool in becom- ing conscious of these Forces, as we frequently notice them first during the process of reflection. Thus we have seen that modern psychology illuminates processes underlying Ceremonial Magic. It would behoove psychologists and psychotherapists as well, however, to pay closer attention to Ceremo- nial Magic. Through Rituals like Magical Evocation, Ceremonial Magic has a great deal to offer psychology, especially regarding tech- nique and methodology. Safety in Evocation Rituals Until this point, every Ritual in the present book has appeared so that the solitary practitioner may easily and readily invoke and banish each Magical Force without the aid of a Magical Order. This chapter includes only one Ritual, however. The solitary practitioner, if he or she has performed each of the preceding ~ituals-in this book, should have no problem in adapting the following Ritual to work, in turn, with each of the Averse Forces, by employing the Hierarchies given within each of the Invocation Rituals, together with the corresponding Names and Sigils from the Infernal ~ieiarchies listed in appendix I< \"Magical Correspondences.\" These precautions are necessary to attempt to avoid the catastrophe that would doubtlessly ensue, should the casual reader skip the rest of the work and attempt to begin directly with Magical Evocation. It remains to clarify how to perform Magical Evocation in safety. The Averse Forces are indeed Unbalanced Forces whose Energy is highly unstable and dangerous. Proper msulation is the most important key to relating to them in a safe fashion. For example, by way of anal- ogy, electricity in itself is neither good nor evil. Although guaranteed to kill you, should you grab a live wire with enough current flowing through it, with proper insulation electricity may nonetheless light up Demonic Evocation an entire city. Likewise, although they are extremely dangerous, the Magician with proper insulation may safely handle the Averse Forces. In a Ritual of Magical Evocation, the Magician organizes his or her defenses to provide sufficient insulation for complete safety. The Ma- gician's first line of defense is the Triangle of Art. This is the space wherein to evoke the Demon to visible appearance and to constrain it during the Ritual. According to Rosicrucian Tradition, another alterna- tive instead of a triangle is to employ polygons whose numbers of an-gles correspond to the nature of the Force. For example, the Evocation of the Qlippoth of Hod could employ an octagon, that of the Spirit of Jupiter, a square, and so forth. In practice, however, the traditional Triangle of Art, specially prepared for the Ritual, is generally quite sufficient. The Adept may nonetheless wish to experiment with poly- gons other than a triangle for use as constrainment devices, since there exists historical precedent in the Rosicrucian Tradition for this varia- tion. Place the Triangle of Art in the East of the Temple or in the Direc- tion usually associated with the Force. For example, to evoke the De- mon of Air, set up the Triangle of Art in the West, the Quarter toward which the Magician should face to skry to the Plane of Air. One line of Tradition then suggests the use of vast amounts of thick, smoky incense for the Entity to use as a material basis to appear. In recent decades, however, research has suggested that the smoke method is but a blind, or \"smoke-screen,\" for the actual procedure, which is to place a mirror inside the Triangle of Art.g For the latter method, arrange the Trian- gle vertically so that the Magician can easily see his or her reflection therein. Although the Adept should experiment with both methods, research reveals the latter to be more effective. There is a distinct ad- vantage to using a mirror in the Triangle instead of smoke, since the En-tity appears together with the reflection of the seer, thus facilitating the projection of psychic contents into the Triangle. Construct the Triangle of Art of plywood, and paint it white. Paint a black triangle outline about two inches inside the edge, and glue a round mirror in the center. Then add the Names and Sigil in crayon or in any other easily removable material before each Ritual. In the fol- lowing illustration, the Triangle of Art bears the Names and Sigil ap- propriate for the Evocation of Zazel, the Demonic Spirit of the Planet Saturn, which follows in this chapter. The Divine name, Archangel, Angel, Intelligence, and Sphere appear in Hebrew in the outer trian- gle. The inner triangle contains the Name and the Sigil of the Demon.

Thus the Divine, Archangelical, and Angelical Forces that correspond to the Demon protect the Sphere of Sensation of the Magician. During the Evocation the Magician affects the Averse Force, con- strained within the Triangle of Art, through sympathy with the Lamen that he or she wears. This Lamen contains all the relevant col- ors, geometrical figures, Names, and Sigils of the Entity's Hierarchy of Forces, including the Name and Sigil of the Averse Force itself. A complete set of such Lamens appears among the color illustrations con- tained in this book, one for each of the Sephirothic, Zodiacal, Plane- tary, and Elemental Forces. The Aim of Evocation The true function of the Magical Evocation of the Averse Forces lies concealed in the Book of the Sncre~i Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage. The Abra-Melin working consists of a six-month Invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel of the Magician, followed by several days of the Invo- cation of the Angels, and finally by several days of the Evocation of the Averse Forces. This is a far different system than those outlined in other Grimoires, most of which seek demonic aid for a laundry list of trivial purposes like finding buried treasure. In the Abra-Melin Ritual, the primary aim of Evocation of the Averse Forces is to solicit an oath of obedience from them to the Magician's Holy Guardian Angel. This is an extremely interesting procedure with far reaching psy- chological implications. Indeed, this is a magical cure for the malady of which the Eastern Lamas, Yogis, and Mystics accuse us: \"That in the West, Consciousness is cut off from its roots.\" There can be no lotus flower without the root in the dark slime. Our fear and condemnation of the dark and demonic in the West have led to a condition wherein the unconscious, instinctual aspects of the Divine have been diabo- lized, shunned, and feared. Thus repressed, these Forces take on a twisted sort of autonomy and indeed manifest in a fashion disruptive to consciousness. Therefore, the Magician extracts an oath of obedience from the De- mon as the climax of the Evocation. In Rosicrucian Magic, the Demon does not swear this oath to the Ego of the Magician. Such an oath would be like the demonic pacts described in certain Grimoires and would place the Magician's Ego in great peril, likely leading to infla- tion, obsession, or to a state of mind once described as demonic posses- sion. Furthermore, unlike the Abra-Melin system, the Demon does not even swear its oath to the Magician's Holy Guardian Angel. In Rosi- crucian Magic, the will of the Magician magnified by the power of the Magic Sword obliges the Demon to swear an oath of allegiance and obedience to the Divine Force corresponding to its own nature and to place its entire Energy at the disposition of the corresponding Archangel. For example, in the Ritual that follows, the Magician obliges the Demonic Spirit of the Planet Saturn, Zazel, to swear alle- giance and obedience to the Divine Force of Saturn, YHVH Elohim, and to place its Energy at the disposition of the corresponding Archangel, Tzaphquiel. This magical act unites the conscious and unconscious aspects of Sat- urn or of that aspect of Psyche corresponding to Saturn. Thus are the In- fernal and Averse Forces constrained, contained, and brought into proper relationship with the Divine and Angelical Forces as well as with the consciousness of the Magician. Although the Divine and An- gelical Forces remain opposite in nature and irreconcilable with the In- fernal and Averse Forces, the Adept nonetheless thereby creates a uni- fied pair of opposites, a dynamic functional polarity of Magical Forces. The Dark Forces are brought into correct relationship with Divine guidance, and Divinity comes to dispose over its dark, chthonic, instinctual power. The Magician thereby grows in awareness, learning to recognize the operation of these Forces in day-to-day life and to liberate him or her- self from their blind Force. At length, the Magician learns to act in co- ordination with Divine guidance and True Will, consciously directing and administrating the Dark Forces like the conductor of a symphony. Thus the Major Adept becomes the conductor of an orchestra of Forces that once conducted him (or her), unseen and unobserved, from the darkness. Thus we may understand what an R. R. et A. C. paper published by Israel Regardie means when it says: \"Hear thou, then, a mystery of the knowledge of evil. The 5=6 Ritual of the Adeptus Minor saith that 'Evil helpeth forward the Good.' When the Evil Sephiroth are ex- pelled from the Nephesh into the Evil Persona, they are, in a sense, equilibrated therein. The evil persona can be rendered a great and strong, yet trained, animal whereupon the man rideth, and it becometh a strength unto his physical base of action ...Now then shalt thou begin to understand the saying 'He descendeth into Hell,' and to comprehend in part this strength, and thus to understand the necessity of evil in material creation.

Although many of these confessions appear rather exaggerated to modern eyes, there in nonetheless sound psychological sense in including some sort of Magical Confessionas a prelude to Magi- cal Evocation. Even if it serves no other purpose, it liberates the Magi- cian of guilt and fear, real or imagined, prior to the Evocation. This is important when confronting Averse Forces, since they may attempt to exploit and manipulate the slightest sign of guilt or fear in the Magician. The following Rite of Magical Confession has been used successfully by the author on numerous occasions. It combines the essence of the Grimoire confessions, certain psychological insights, and a Magical Formula for the forgiveness of sins purportedly used by Christ himself, which derives from the Gnostic Gospel, Pistis Sophia.\" The solitary practitioner may use this example, create his or her own personal confession, or entirely omit such a Rite as a prelude to Evocation. Rite Proclaim: \"I confess my sins to God, to my Holy Guardian Angel, and to myself, that I may be free of all guilt, fear, and insecurity. I have at times acted contrary my values. I have even blamed myself for things which were not my doing, nor even my responsibility. I forgive myself for all wrongdoing, real or imaginary. I forgive myself for falling short of my ideals and expectations at times, for acting contrary to my val- ues, and for blaming myself for things beyond my control. As I forgive myself, I ask forgiveness from God and my Holy Guardian Angel as well, that I may perform this Ritual of Magical Evocation at peace with myself and free from all guilt, fear, and insecurity. I Invoke Di- vine mercy, compassion, and forgiveness in the name of El and of the Sephirah of Chesed.

Therefore, that I may stand in purity in the presence of my Angel, let the forgiver of sins come, whose names are these: 'SIPHIREPSNIKHIEU, ZENEI, BER-IMOU, SOKHABRIKHER, EUTHARI, NANAI DIEIS BALMERIKH, MEUNIPOS, KHIRIE, ENTAIR, MOUTHIOUR, SMOUR, PEUKHER, OOUSKHOUS, MINIONOR, ISOKHOBORTHA.'

This chart should be within the Circle with the Magician dur- ing the Working. Calculate the Planetary Hours prior to the Ritual, since for Astrological Forces, it is particularly important to begin the Ritual during the Day and the Hour of the Planet or of the Planet rul- ing the Sign. Once the Ritual begins, the Magician should not leave the Magic Circle for any reason whatsoever until the Ritual is concluded, and all of the Forces have been banished. Make necessary arrangements ahead of time to be able to perform the Ritual uninterrupted. Synopsis Altar: Magic Circle.

Israel Regardie warned that \"It is a very powerful system, and if used carelessly or indiscriminately will bring about disaster and spiritual disintegration.\"' Paul Foster Case considered the Enochian system to be hopelessly tainted, and removed Enochian Magic entirely when he reformulated Golden Dawn material into his B. 0.T. A. Don- ald Tyson has even suggested that Enochian Magic was revealed to John Dee as a means of setting in motion the destructive forces of the apocalypse, as described in the book of Revelation in the New Testa- ment.2 While there does exist a certain parallel between the English translation of a few of the Enochian Calls and the apocalyptic im- agery of the book of Revelation, this imagery may be considered as symbolical of spiritual realities rather than descriptive of physical events. In any case, much of the fear surrounding Enochian Magic has been greatly exaggerated. The author of the present book has been working with the Enochian system, including the Enochian Calls, for many years, with great suc- cess, and without fulfilling any of the aforementioned predictions of gloom and doom. The Enochian Calls serve primarily as Energy ampli- fiers, and when properly used, clearly add great power to Rituals of ' Tlie Golderi Dauri (Tllr original Account of tlir Tracl~iri~c, rfR~tes, cnrid C~~rerrlotrir, itrc tlernretrc Urdrr i!t the Golden Daiuili [1937], revealed by Israel Regardie, 6th ed.

Nonetheless, the decision whether or not to employ the Enochian Calls with the Rituals contained in the present book must be left to the discretion, personal responsibility, and risk of each Magician. A primary difficulty in working with Enochian Magic lies in find- ing a correct or satisfactory means of pronunciation. Names derived from the Enochian Tablets are particularly problematic as consonants therein are frequently so clumped together that such Names are virtu- ally impossible to pronounce. In recognition of this problem, certain rules were laid out by W. Wynn Wescott and S. L. MacGregor Mathers for the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Wescott suggested that each letter should be pro- nounced separately. Using this method, for example, the consonant clump \"pfmng\" would be pronounced \"pee-ef-em-en-gee.\" Mathers in- stead proposed that the first vowel in the name of the phonetically equivalent Hebrew letter be employed. For example, the Hebrew name for phonetical equivalent of the letter \"I\" is \"Lamed.\" Therefore, Mathers suggests that the vowel \"a\" be used to render words pro- nounceable when the letter \"I\" appears in consonant clumps. Each of these methods are indeed quite useful when working with Names drawn from the Enochian Tablets. Unfortunately, however, the blathers and Wescott rules have tended to be applied far too rigidly and dogn~atically, especially to the Enochian Calls, resulting in end- less strings of extraneous syllables. For example, one recent book on the Golden Dawn transliterated the word \"Ozongon\" from an Enochian Call as \"Oh-zoad-oh-noo-goh-noo.\" Numerous clues to correct pronunciation may be found in original manuscripts%andwritten by John Dee. These manuscripts clearly indi- cate that the dogmatic application of such rules to the Enochian Calls was neither originally intended by Dee nor by the Angels which dic- tated them. The Calls properly pronounced and free of surplus sylla- bles remain sonorous in the extreme, reflecting the vibrant beauty of the language of Angels. The Enoshian Calls given in this appendix have been retransliter- ated from Sloane Manuscript 3191. In preparing this new translitera- tion, every effort has been made to restore the pronunciation to that most likely intended by John Dee and the Angels. The student who prefers, however, to use the Wescott-Mathers method will find the Calls elsewhere so transliterated by Israel Regardie.4 Slocuic,IvlS 3iY1 /15'15?],Dr John Uee (l.oitdon: The Brit~shLibrary). Israel Rcgard~c,rile-Gi!ripletc Guliirtl Dn721i Sitsteni uJ Mrig~s(Santa Mon~ca 1:alcon Press, 1987), Vol Enochian Calls This fresh transliteration of Sloane MS 3191 has presented numerous difficulties and raised interesting questions. To begin with, the word spacing in the handwritten version of the Angelic Calls is so bad in certain places that is nearly impossible to distinguish where one Enochian word ends and the next one begins. Furthermore, the fashion that the English translations are arranged above the Enochian text in the original manuscript is of little use in overcoming this problem. Ev- ery effort has therefore been made to reproduce, as closely as possible, the original word spacing of the Enochian in the transliteration given below. The most fascinating question regarding pronunciation raised by an examination of Dee's handwritten version of the Angelic Calls in Sloane MS 3191 is his copious use of diacritical marks. This mystery appears to have been completely overlooked or ignored by contempo- rary Enochian scholarship. The primary diacritical marks used by Dee are ', A, and \", and they are used over vowels in ninety-five per cent of all instances. These diacritics have been included in the new translit- eration as faithfully as possible. In each instance where an Enochian word is given, the spelling used by John Dee in Sloane 3191 including his diacritical marks has been reproduced side by side with its new transliteration shown in brackets. Unfortunately, however, certain substitutions for the diacritical marks actually used by Dee have been obliged by editorial considerations. The mark A has been substituted for the mark actually used by Dee, which most closely resembles the upward pointing curve used in modern English to indicate a short vowel sound. It is hoped that the inclusion of these diacritical markings shall stimulate additional research regarding their actual meaning. An examination of Sloane MS 3191 by various Professors of modern and classical European languages and linguistics has unfortunately not yet conclusively ascertained the meaning of the diacritical markings. It has been determined, however, that their usage apparently does not match neither that of Latin, Greek, nor any Germanic, Latin, nor Slavic derivative language, neither as they are employed today nor as they were used during the Sixteenth Century. It is therefore likely that the they represent a personal phonetical code devised by Dee for his personal use. The transliteration methodology which has been employed in the present book for all Enochian words is outlined below and has been ad- hered to in a consistent fashion. The resulting fresh transliteration of Enochian Names and Calls remains steeped in Rosicrucian tradition, 10, pp. 56-74"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"571 570 \tThe Ritual Adagic Mnrzltal yet as true as possible to the original manuscripts as well. Transliteration Methodology 1. \tEvery effort has been made to avoid the addition extraneous vow- els and syllables. 2. \tThe phonetic value of each individual letter has been preserved. 3 \tWherever necessary, consonants which may be elongated through prolonged vibration as suggested by Wescott (particularly I, m, n, r, v, and z) have been used as separate syllables (avoiding thereby the addition of extraneous vowels). 4. \tWherever an extra vowel is absolutely necessary, the first vowel in the name of the equivalent Hebrew letter has been employed as suggested by Mathers. 5. \tIn the choice of vowel sounds, preference has been given to the phonetic values of vowel sounds most frequently used in Hebrew as suggested by Mathers. 6. \tThe sound of the letter z should be elongated through prolonged vibration. This appears to be the true meaning of the marginal notes made by Dee in Sloane 3191 rather than the literal pronunci- ation of \"z\" as \"zod,\" the Elizabethan appellation of the letter Uz,?'5 7. \tThe letter Q has been transliterated as \"k~.\"~ In cases where there is no vowel follo\\ving in the Enochian, it has been transliterated as \"kw2.\" 8. \tThere is no evidence to be found in the manuscripts indicating an Enochian equivalent of the English sounds of the combined conso- nants \"sh,\" \"ph,\" or \"th.\" They have therefore been transliterated in such a fashion that the phonetic values of the individual let- ters have been retained. There are numerous instances, however, where marginal notations do suggest that \"ch\" should be pro- nounced as a k. In the present transliteration, this \"ch\" has been given a guttural phonetical value similar to the German \"ch\" as used in the word \"Buch.\" This has been indicated as an underlined \"k\"-in the transliterations. 9. \tThere are sporadic instances where marginal notes indicate that the letter \"g\"should be pronounced as \"dg.\" Obviously \"g\" has two phonetic values in Enochian: that of a hard g (as in \"go\") as well 'This apparent nusunderstandulg of the margmal notes has had a profound and unfortunate effect on the history of Enochan prt,nunclat~on. Far from arbitrary, this itas been extrapolated from various margll~al ncltdtlons 111the Sloane MS 3191 Enochinn Calls as one which closely approximates the English \"j\" (as in \"job\"). Attempts have been made to be as consistent as possible with the transliteration of this letter. Patterns revealed by marginal nota- tion have been given priority. In doubtful instances the more sonorous option has been employed. 10. According \tto marginal notes, the letter \"c\" is at times to be transliterated as \"k\" and at other times as \"s.\" Attempts have been made to be as consistent as possible with the tra~lsliteration of this letter. Patterns revealed by marginal notation have been given priority. In doubtful instances the more sonorous option has been employed. 11. In Dee's handwriting the uppercase letters \"U\" and \"V\" are consis- tently rendered as \"V.\" Furthermore, there are numerous instances wherein from one place to another in Sloane MS 3191 Dee also in- terchanges the lower case letters \"u\" and \"v\" as well. Every at- tempt has nonetheless been made to maintain the phonetic value of the letters \"u\" and \"v\" as they actually appear in the manuscript, except in cases where an extra vowel would have then become necessary. In certain instances where an additional vowel is required by the text \"v\" has been rendered \"vh.\" The Enochian Calls and the Elemental Tablets The Application of the Calls to the Enochian Elemental Tablets is re- sumed below.

It is possible to rearrange the letters of m7' into twelve dif- ferent orders or permutations. These may then be associated with other groups of twelve things: the signs of the Zodiac, the Tribes of Israel, the categories of Aristotle, and so forth. For this example, the Twelve Banners of 712' are linked to the signs of the Zodiac, and the results are examined in the light of one of the \"traditional\" sets of correspon- dences to 717'. The order of the Banners or permutations of 717' is im- portant. The method is to start with the usual form of the name and then to get a second form by switching the last two letters about. The third banner is obtained from the second by switching the fourth and second letters. The fourth is obtained from the third by switching the last and first letters. The fifth is obtained from the fourth by switch- ing the last two letters about. The rest are obtained by a repetition of the same series of operations. The twelfth banner automatically is changed by this process into the first, and the whole thing repeats in a regular cycle of such permutations. This is also the nature of the annual cycle of the twelve signs of the Zodiac.

Regarding Planetary Magic, numerous aspects of the Heptarchical system out- lined by John Dee in Sloane MSS 3188 and 3191 have appeared particu- larly promising. Previous efforts to integrate this material met with but limited suc- cess due to divergent systems of ordering the Planets. In the Table of the Forty-nine Good Angels,l Dee arranges the Planets in the following Order: Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, Saturn, and Moon, unto each one of which corresponds the Names of a King, a Prince, and five other Angels. In the following adaptation of Dee's illustration, numbers added around the outer circumference show the attribution of the forty-nine Enochian Calls to the Planetary and Subplanetary Forces. An analysis of this attribution follows later in this examination. ' Illustrated in Sloane MS 3191 [1585?],Dr. John Dee (I.ondo11. The Rrrt~sh 1.1brary)"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"The Ritual Magic Manual The Table of the Forty-nine Good Angels Apparently, Dee's Planetary ordering diverges from any arrangement employed by the R. R. et A. C. A careful examination of Sloane MS. 3191, however, reveals a solution to this problem. Luckily, when pre- senting the forty-two Ministers that serve each King and his Prince, Dee includes the Sigil of an Angel at the top of each manuscript folio.2 The Names of these Angels derive from the Sigillum Dei Aemeth. The Names of the Kings derive from the Table of the Forty-nine Good An-gels, which associates a Planet with each King. By applying the Planetary correspondence of each King to the Sig- illum Dei Aemeth by way of the Sigils and Angels from the manuscript folios, a different planetary ordering becomes apparent, occulted in the Sigillum Dei Aemeth. When orienting the Sigillum Dei Aemeth with the top facing toward the West, this arrangement exactly corresponds to the planetary order in the Vault of the Adepti: Venus, Moon, Saturn, For a transcrlptlon of these MS tollos, see John Dee, The Ei~richlanEvocatron qfDr John Dee, ed and trans Geoffrey James (G~llette Heptangle, 1984)' pp 44-52 Book of the Concourse of Planetary and Zodiacal Forces 623 Jupiter, Mars, Sun, and Mercury. This previously hidden correspondence between the planetary arrangement implicit in the Sigillum Dei Aemeth and the walls of the Vault of the Adepti thus provides the key that enables an effective integration of the two systems. The color illustration of the Sigillum Dei Aemeth included in this book depicts this correspondence through the Planetary colors on the Hexagram and the inner Heptagon. Through the clear link between the Meptarchical Kings attributed to each Planet and seven Angels of the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, the Sig- illum represents a Tablet of Union for Planetary Forces. The Sigillum thus serves an identical function in Planetary Magic as does the Tablet of Union in Elemental Magic. Furthermore, the Seals around the cir- cumference of the Sigillum and the Names connected with them (i.e., Galas, Gethog, Horlwn, Aaoth, Galethog, Innon, and Thaaoth) like- wise correspond with the Planets. These Seals and Names thus serve as a connecting link between the Sigillum Dei Aemeth and the individual Planetary Tablets. Each Planetary Tablet consists of a Seal derived from the circum- ference of the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, the Name of the corresponding Heptarchical King in the first Row, and the forty-two letters that comprise the forty-two Ministers of this King below. Thus every Tablet contains seven Rows of seven letters, which together yield forty-nine Squares. The letters comprising the forty-two Ministers of each Heptarchi- cal King originate by permutation from the Table of the Forty-nine Good Angels. The enterprising student can easily work this out for him \" or herself by comparing each group of forty-two Ministers with the Table of Forty-nine Good Angels and discovering the patterns through which each group of letters derives. Such a study, however, clearly reveals a number of transcription errors made by Dee in Sloane MS 3191. The Planetary Tablets in this book include corrections of these errors with the noteworthy exception of the Saturn Tablet. The permutation method through which this group of letters originates remains undiscovered. Any apparent pattern would require the significant change of at least eleven of the forty-two letters. Therefore, the letters that appear on the Saturn Tablet in this book match exactly those given by Dee in Sloane MS 3191. This is the most satisfactory arrange- ment until additional research reveals a better solution for the Saturn Tablet. On each Planetary Tablet, a Traditional Planet rules each Row and Column. The Planet of the Tablet governs the first Row and Column of"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"621 The Ritunl Magic Mn~ual each Tablet. The remaining Planets rule remaining Rows and Columns from left to right and from top to bottom in the order that the Planets appear in the walls of the Vault of the Adepti. According to the King's Scale color attributed to each Planet, this order precisely matches the progression of the colors of the visible spectrum. The King's Scale Color of the Planet that rules the Row determines the color of Squares within each Row. The King's Scale Color of the Planet governing the Column likewise deternines the color of Letters inside the Squares within each Column. Thus each of the forty-nine Squares of any I'lanetary Tablet embodies a uniquely different inter- play of Planetary and Subplanetary Forces. The Magician may thus determine the interplay of Forces within each Square at a glance ac- cording to color. The following analogy clarifies the relationship between the Table of the Forty-nine Good Angels and the individual Planetary Tablets. Imagine that each Planetary Tablet is an independent country. The Table of Forty-nine Good Angels then represents the combined Foreign Mulistries as well as Embassies of each of the Seven countries. The King, as head of State in both foreign and domestic affairs, stands first in his section on the Table of the Forty-nine Good Angels as well as on his Planetary Tablet. The Prince is like a Foreign Minister. Although second only to the King in influence at home, the Prince lives out of the country in one of the six Embassies. The Name of the Prince of each country lies not in the same section as his King on the Table of the Forty-nine Good Angels but in the section immediately preceding it and following the Name of the King in that section. By analogy, this sec- tion is the foreign country where the Prince lives and works in the Em- bassy. The remaining five An~bassadors live in the remaining five coun- tries of their Embassies. The Names of these Ambassadors lie on the Table of Forty-nine Good Angels, therefore, in the remaining five sec- tions of the Table where they respectively occupy in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh positions. In the preceding illustration of the Table of the Forty-Nine Good Angels, a small Planetary Glyph imme- diately preceding each Name indicates the \"country of origin of each of these Entities. The Entities depicted on the Table of the Forty-nine Good Angels are Archangelic Forces as related to the Planetary Tablets. The Prince and the five Ambassadors, to continue the analogy, occasionally come home from their Embassies abroad. At home they each have a particu- lar area of influence as well. The King and the Prince together govern Book of the Concourse of Pla~letar!y and Zodlacnl Forces 625 the Tablet as a whole. Additionally, since each Row of the Tablet rep- resents a Subplanetary Force, the King governs the first Row of the Tablet as well, which bears the Letters of his Name. The Prince and the Ambassadors each governs one of the remaining Rows of the Tablet. Sympathies of the Subplanetary Forces determine these areas of influence. For example, Bormila, the Ambassador of Venus depicted on the Table of Forty-nine Good Angels in the Saturn section, rules the Row of the Venus Tablet bearing the letters LBBNAAU. Saturn governs this Row, which represents the Subplanetary Force, Saturn of Venus. The Entities of the Table of the Forty-nine Good Angels govern of the remaining Subplanetary Rows of the Planetary Tablets in the same fashion. The Table below resumes and illustrates this relationship. Besides these Archangels, an Angel governs each Subplanetary Row of the Planetary Tablets as well. The Names of these Angels are iden- tical with the Names depicted on the individual Rows of the Tablets beginning with the first letter of each line. In the rows bearing the Names of the Heptarchical Kings, the King represents the Angelic as well as the Archangelic Force. Furthermore, an Angel governs each Square of the Planetary Tablets. The Names of these Angels begin with the letter of the Square, continue to the right to the end of the Row, then finish from the beginning of the Row toward the right again, including every letter of the line in the Name. This is identical with the derivation of the Names of the Angels ruling the Servient Squares of the Elemental Tablets. In invoking the Angel of any specific Square of any Planetary Tablet, begin first the Greater Invoking Ritual of the Hexagram for the Planet ruling the Tablet. Next invoke the Archangel and the Angel that govern the Row before invoking the An- gel ruling the specific Square. The forty-nine Enochian Calls correspond to the Planets, as well as to the forty-nine Subplanetary Rows of the combined seven Planetary Tablets, according to the arrangement of the Planets given by John Dee in the circular Table of the Forty-nine Good Angels. Calls one through seven correspond with the seven Kings in a clockwise fashion beginning with the Venus section. Calls eight through fourteen likewise corre- spond with the Princes beginning with the Venusian Prince located in the preceding, Lunar section of the Table. The remaining Calls like- wise correspond with the Ambassadors. The Angels communicating with John Dee withheld the First Enochian Call, stating that it appertained only to God and could not be revealed. Dee nonetheless numbers the first Call given by the Angels as the First, resulting in a system of forty-eight rather than forty-nine"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"626 The Ritual Magic Manual Book of the Concourse of Planetary and Zodiacill Forces 627 Calls. The final Call therefore appears twice Subplanetarily, to com- pensate for this fact. To fully grasp the planetary attribution of the Enochian Calls, the student should carefully observe the numerical or- der of the Calls given around the outer circumference of the Table of Forty-nine Good Angels, illustrated at the beginning of this appendix. The First Call additionally rules the Sigillum Dei Aemeth (the Planetary Tablet of Union) as a whole, the Names included in the sec- tion of the Sigillum Dei Aemeth attributed unto Venus, and the Sigil of Galas. This Sigil appears on the circumference of the Sigillum Dei Aemeth in the Venus section as well as on the Seal of the Venus Tablet. Calls two through seven moreover rule to the remaining Planetary sec- tions, Sigils, and Names depicted on the Sigillum according to the aforementioned Planetary attributions. When invoking the Name of any Entity from the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, first vibrate the First Call followed by the Call that governs the Planetary section of the Sig- illum containing the Name. When invoking any Planetary Tablet or any Subplanetary Row of any Tablet, first vibrate the Call ruling the Planetary Tablet. To in- voke any Subplanetary Row of any Planetary Tablet, next vibrate the Call that rules the Subplanetary Iiow. The following Table resumes the above correspondences as related to the seven Planetary Tablets and their forty-nine Subplanetary Rows.

The first impediment arises because John Dee, in \"Earthly Knowl- edge, Aid, and Vict~ry,\"~ attributes the Twelve Tribes of Israel to the Signs of the Zodiac differently than does the R. R. et A. C. The Signs of the Zodiac thus correspond differently with the Enochian Zodiacal Kings in each system. The second difficulty relates closely to the first and concerns the best method of attributing twelve Divine Names from the Elemental Tablets to the Zodiacal Signs. In a lecture to members of the Golden Dawn, entitled \"On the Twelve Tribes of Israel and the Twelve Signs of the Zodia~,\"~ S. L.

Book of the Concourse of Planetary and Zodiacal Forces 635 attempts to elucidate these correspondences by weaving a tapestry of associations with the Tribes, derived primarily from Biblical sources. These include the children of Jacob, their various Mothers, their order of birth, and the blessings of Moses and Jacob upon the various Tribes. Interestingly, Albert Pike presents a nearly identical exposition of similar associations in Morals And Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry.\" Mathers then comments upon the vari- ous armorial bearings ascribed to the twelve Tribes. This ascription exactly corresponds to that of the twelve ensigns attributed to the twelve Tribes in English Royal Arch Freemasonry.12 Thus it becomes apparent that the source from which the Golden Dawn borrowed this particular set of correspondences is English Royal Arch Freemasonry. John Dee intended a different arrangement, however, implied in a diagram, entitled \"Ordo Israelis Dispersi, hoc Estate 1585,\"13 illus- trated below. Although Dee does not include the Glyphs of the Zodia- cal Signs, but rather the numbers one through twelve, his intention is nonetheless easy to deduce. When one assigns the Zodiacal Signs from Aries as one through Pisces as twelve, the resulting attribution of the twelve Tribes of Israel to the Zodiacal Signs exactly matches those given by Cornelius Agrippa in his book on Celestial Magic.l4 Dee clearly intended to attribute the twelve Tribes of Israel as well as the Enochian Zodiacal Kings to the Signs of the Zodiac according to the correspondences used by Agrippa.

This arrangement exactly coincides with the Golden Dawn attribution of the Elements to the four Quarters according to their \"Natural position in the Zodiac.\"15 Thus it provides an excellent vehicle for the complete integration of the two systems. The chart below shows the correspondences that the Golden Dawn has traditionally used in this regard. The correspondence between the Enochian Zodiacal Kings and the Zodiacal Signs does not match that intended by Dee, as demonstrated above. Instead, the Golden Dawn correspondences between the Tribes and the Signs derived from Royal Arch Freemasonry, when applied to the above diagram, result in com- pletely different correspondences between the Signs and the Kings.16 Zodiacal Enochian Divine Tribe of Is-Sign Zodiacal Name rael King Lavavoth Aozpi Gad Arfalog Mor Ephraim Zarnaah Dial Manasseh Alpudus Hctga Issachar Hononol Oip Judah Zarzilg Teaa Naphthali Gebabel Pdoce Asshur Olpaged MP~ Dan Cadaamp Arsl Benjamin Zinggen Caiol Zebulon Ziracah Oro Reuben Zurchol Ibah Simeon The inclusion in these correspondences of twelve Divine Names from the Enochian Elemental Tablets further impeded the successful inte- gration of Enochian material into Rosicrucian Zodiacal Magic.

The Great Circle of the Quarters This arrangement, although seductive, is seriously flawed. The Ele-ments of the Tablets from which these Divine Names originate do not correspond with the Elemental Triplicities of the Zodiacal Signs. When used in Ceremonial Magic, the failure of this arrangement be- comes obvious. For example, it requires the Magician to invoke Sagit- tarius (a Fire Sign) using a Fire Invoking Pentagram while vibrating ARSL, a Divine Name from the Elemental Tablet of Water. Further- more, the attribution of the Elements to the Quarters in this arrange- ment bears no resemblance to anything else in the R. R. et A. C. system. The following diagram illustrates an alternative, superior means of integrating the two systems.

The Name of each King consists of seveIl letters resulting in twelve Rows and seven Columns, which together yield eighty-four Squares. A Zodiacal Sign governs each Row, and a Traditional Planet governs each Column. The King's Scale Color of the Zodiacal Sign ruling the Row deter- mines the color of Squares within each Row. The Zodiacal Signs' colors progress as do the colors from an artist's palette. The King's Scale Color of the Planet governing the Column determines the color of Let- ters inside Squares within each Column. The Planetary colors progress as do colors through the spectrum of visible light, which is the same order as the walls of the Vault of the Adepti. Thus each of the eighty- four Squares of the Zodiacal Tablet embodies a uniquely different in-terplay of Zodiacal and Planetary Forces, which the Magician may discern at a glance according to color. The following illustration shows the correspondences of the Zodia- cal Signs and Quinants2 with the Squares of the Zodiacal Tablet. The first Square of each Row corresponds to the Zodiacal Sign of the Row as a whole. The remaining six Squares of each Row consecutively corre- spond each to one Quinant of the Sign (that is, five degrees).

R. et A. C.) are two divisions of an initiatic and mag- ical Order founded by high-ranking Freemasons in England, respec- tively in 1888 and 1892. Although the exact origins of the Order remain obscure as well as controversial, its primary historical importance lies in its brilliant synthesis of mythical and magical material, from such varied sources as the Fanza Fraternitatis (the first published Rosicrucian document), The Egyptian Book of the Dead, Cornelius Agrippa, Tycho Brahe, and John Dee. Salient aspects of the vast corpus of the Order's initiatic and magical material were first revealed in 1937 by the late Dr. Israel Regardie. This material has subsequently impacted most areas of modern magic, as well as many other arenas of spirituality. Israel Iiegardie (1907-1985) stands as an important generational link to the magical rebirth of the late nineteenth century, as well as a pioneer in an early attempt to integrate psychology and magic. Born in 1907, Regardie as a young man knew both Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) and Dion Fortune (1890-1946), two early adepts of the Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis, each of whom went on to found their own eso- teric fraternities. Regardie was also initiated into the Stella Matutina, an early offshoot of the Golden Dawn. Finally, Regardie's work was groundbreaking as an early attempt to integrate psychology and magic."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"646 The Ritual Magic Ma~izlal When Iiegardie was a young man, he fervently wished to become a magician. He considered Aleister Crowley to be the foremost magician of the period and, having introduced himself to Crowley by means of an admiring letter, began to work as his personal secretary in Paris in 1928. After several years with Crowley, Regardie was forced to leave as the result of a painful rupture with his mentor. The trauma caused by this breach wounded Regardie deeply; he later said it took him nearly seven years to recover from it. Impoverished and confused, Regardie was taken in as a house guest of Dion Fortune, who was living near Glastonbury in southwest Eng- iand. Fortune was not only a talented magician but a natural clairvoy- ant as well. Until he died he never forgot her hospitality and generos- ity during this difficult period. Dion Fortune influenced Regardie in a completely unexpected direc- tion. She had been instrumental in bringing Sigmund Freud's ideas to England and had written a collection of short stories called The Secrets of Dr. Tizzirr~ler. Although she characterized these stories as fiction, she said that Dr. Taverner actually existed and that the stories re- flected factual case studies in which psychological and magical pro- cesses were linked. It was at Dion Fortune's dinner table that Regardie was first ex- posed to the ideas of Freud and C. G. Jung. Shortly thereafter, still struggling with the onslaught of emotions stemming from his breach with Crowley, Regardie entered first into Freudian psychoanalysis and later into Jungian analysis. During this phase Regardie became aware of how great a role his own unresolved emotional conflicts from early childhood had played in his rupture with Crowley. Regardie eventually concluded that it was such unresolved infantility that ac- counted for most of the chaotic group dynamics of earlier esoteric fra- ternities. This would lead him to insist on the necessity of psychother- apy for anyone seriously practicing any spiritual discipline. Regardie later moved to the US., where he became familiar with the ideas of Wilhelm Reich and entered into Reichian therapy. He also began to correspond with Reich's daughter Eva, which stimulated him to take a serious interest in the mind-body connection and at length to train as a chiropractor. Even tourard the end of his life, Iiegardie continued to respect both Freudian psychoanalysis and the ideas of Jung. He eventually came to believe, however, that Jungian analysis as he had experienced it was lacking in effective technique. He ultimately concluded that verbal therapy of any orientation paled in the light of Reich's bodywork, and Israel Regardie, The Golden Dawn, and Psychotherapy 647 that the techniques of ceremonial magic would one day become a pow- erful adjunct to psychotherapy. As a therapist and a bodyworker, Regardie combined Reich's ap- proach with minor chiropractic adjustments, basic magical techniques, and hatha yoga. In a typical session, Regardie would begin by initiat- ing deep, rhythmic breathing in the client for a considerable period of time. This hyperventilation would create a slightly altered state of consciousness. During this process Regardie would survey various areas of tension on the body and would reduce their tightness with a type of deep and at times painful massage. Both Regardie and Reich felt that unresolved emotional conflicts were stored in the body as tension. Using a physical approach would release blockages so that life energy, which Reich called \"orgone,\" could pass freely through the entire body. During the course of a ses- sion, a great deal of emotion would frequently emerge, which the client was encouraged to express. Regardie often related Reichian ideas to the magic of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He was particularly fond of one magical exercise called the Middle Pillar Ritual. In this technique the magi- cian visualizes successive spheres of light at various points above, be- low, and along the spinal column while vibrating certain words. This generates a certain kind of energy, which, according to Regardie, is identical to Reich's orgone. This energy is then circulated around and through the entire body by means of further visualization. Legitimate esoteric orders have always been primarily intended to provide a context within which initiation may safely and effectively occur. As will be shown here, there are many parallels between initia- tion and forms of psychotherapy that take into account the spiritual dimensions of growth. Regardie even advised that the two should be considered as complementary processes, and that initiation should al- ways be accompanied by some form of psychotherapy. Regardie of course considered Reichian therapy to be the most use- ful adjunct to magical work. In view of the current lack of trained Re- ichian therapists, however, other schools of psychology suitable for work alongside magical training are those that include spiritual growth as a part of their paradigm, such as the Jungian and Transper- sonal orientations, Psychosynthesis, and the emerging school of Eso- teric Psychology. Why does a candidate for initiation need psychotherapy? Any form of spiritual training, when practiced with enough sincerity and discipline, will eventually activate what Jung calls the complexes of"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"the personal unconscious. These may be defined as infantile emotional patterns left over from very early childhood that revolve around unre- solved parental conflicts. These complexes are symbolized in the di- grams in this appendix by the seven-headed dragon. Frequently they are energized by spiritual practices. Uniess the complexes are allowed to emerge into consciousness in a safe and controlled fashion, they can be acted out in dangerous ways. This helps explain why many \"spiritual\" groups have become dysfunc- tional and at times even destructive. Admittedly, combining initiation and psychotherapy does involve some difficulties. Whereas psychotherapy is unlikely to harm the ef- fectiveness of an initiation or of any other genuinely spiritual process, not everyone seeking initiation can afford the substantial expense of psychotherapy. Furthermore the average lay person may find it diffi- cult to distinguish an effective therapist from an incompetent one. Un- fortunately, inept and destructive psychotherapists are frequently easier to find than capable ones, and the same holds true for initiators and initiating orders. Far too many esoteric groups are primarily moti- vated by their leaders' needs for money or manipulative control over people's lives. True initiation is a process not unlike that of psychotherapy in that the skill and personal ethics of the initiator are crucial to a successful outcome. Moreover a relationship with an unethical initiator can be as damaging as one with an unethical psychotherapist. Anyone seeking initiation thus needs to be extremely discriminating in the choice of an initiator or order. The seeker also needs to distinguish between initiating orders and personality cults, since far too many spiritual groups have been built around the personalities of charismatic but manipulative leaders. This phenomenon, combined with a disregard for the psychological issues that may arise, accounts for many of the abuses that have plagued the esoteric community. An analysis of the psychological dynamics underlying initiation will help to clarify why such abuses occur. The initiatic process of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn clearly illustrates the dangers as well as the potential of initiation. But let us first consider the primary differences between initiation and psychotherapy. Initiation, as its name suggests, may be defined as a new beginning. In the Golden Dawn system, the initiatic process has a magical as well as a psychological component. The magical component may be de- scribed as the systematic awakening or ignition of certain forces or en- Israel Regardie, The Golden Dawn, and Psychotherizpy 649 ergies in the \"Sphere of Sensation\" of the initiate. (The Sphere of Sen- sation is the term used by the Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis to describe what is commonly called the energy body or the aura.) This process requires an initiator in whom these forces are already awakened and active, since initiation occurs through an actual trans- mission of energies. Thus from a magical perspective, the relationship between the initiator and the candidate is crucial. In this sense genuine self-initiation, if not altogether impossible, is at least extremely dif- ficult to achieve. It is nonetheless possible, although difficult, to ac- complish much of this magical aim of initiation through systemati- cally and repeatedly invoking the correct magical energies using cere- monial magic Although much has been written about the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, almost nothing has been said about the overall initiatic process in which the Golden Dawn is but the first step. From the begin- ning, this system was conceived as being composed ten grades, each one corresponding to a Sephirah on the Qabalistic Tree of Life, and of three degrees, each one corresponding to an entire order.

The grades of the first degree begin with the Neophyte initiation and correspond to the Sephiroth of Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, and Netsach. The second degree and order are those of the Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis. The Grades of the second degree begin with the probationary initiation of the Portal of the Vault of the Adepti and correspond to the Sephiroth of Tiphareth, Gevurah, and Chesed. The third degree and order are those of the Ordo Argentei Astri (commonly referred to as the third order). The grades of the third order correspond to the Sephiroth of Binah, Chokmah, and Kether, and begin with the probationary initi- ation of the Portal of the Abyss (which corresponds to Non-Sephirah of Daath). In the first order, the magical forces are awakened, activated, and balanced in the candidate by the initiator in the rituals themselves. These forces are those of the traditional elements; Fire, Water, Air, Earth, and Spirit, which are symbolized by a pentagram. Beginning in the second order, however, the individual practice of ceremonial magic greatly enhances this process. The Second Order work primarily activates the forces of the seven traditional planets: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon, which are symbolized by a hexagram. Furthermore, in the second order, the adept learns to in- dependently work with the elements through a series of sub-grades, which further differentiates these forces in the adept's aura. The third order primarily activates the forces of the signs of the zodiac, as well as alchemical Salt, Sulfur, and Mercury, which are symbolized by a triangle. Thus the work of the third order includes alchemy as a psycho-spiritual process as well as ceremonial magic. Having thus examined the magical aspect of initiation, we may now understand the significance of the symbol of the Rose Cross (shown below) used by the Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis. Though its imagery is too intricate to be fully discussed here, we might point out that this Rose Cross symbolically depicts the forces awakened in the energy body of a fully initiated adept. It also illustrates the harmony and equilibrium of their operation, as represented by the four elements and the seven traditional planets. Israel Regardie, The Golden Dawn, and Psycizotizerapy 651 The three concentric rings of Hebrew letters in the center of the figure are divided into groups of three, seven, and twelve letters each. This distribution is taken from the Sepher Yetzirah or \"Book of Formation\" of the ancient Qabalists. The innermost ring corresponds to the first or- der and the forces of the elements. The second ring corresponds to the second order as well as to the seven traditional planets, while the third correlates to the third order and the signs of the Zodiac. Let us go on to examine some of the dynamics of psychotherapy in order to better understand initiation from a psychological perspective. According to certain schools of psychology, a phenomenon called \"transference\" figures prominently in effective psychotherapy. Trans- ference may be defined as the process of becoming conscious of our unre- solved parental conflicts. During the course of psychotherapy, the client begins to see the therapist as embodying these unresolved con- flicts. This occurs as the client projects the contents of his or her own un-"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"652 The Ritzial Magic Manual lsrael Regardie, The Golden Dazun, and Psyclzotherapy 653 conscious onto the therapist in much the same fashion as a film is pro- jected onto a blank screen. Transference also plays a crucial role in the process of initiation, ex- cept that here it is the initiator who becomes the screen for the projec- tions. This is one reason why initiation may be such an extremely effec- tive tool in facilitating personal as well as spiritual development. But it also explains why initiation in the hands of inept or unscrupulous leaders can lead to heartbreak, disappointment, or even death and de- struction. Moreover, because the transferential relationship with an-other human being is a central factor in initiation as well, genuine self- initiation is as impossible as self-administered psychotherapy. , As we have already mentioned, psychotherapy concurrent with ini- tiation is a good idea, even if it is not always possible. But certain spe- cial circumstances do need to be considered. Certainly the therapist should be able to regard spirituality as a healthy phenomenon; ide- ally he or she should have experience working with spiritual issues. Although the therapist and the initiator do not need to consult each other, they must maintain healthy boundaries in their relationship with the initiate. It is never a good idea for a therapist to discuss case material outside the therapeutic relationship. Unfortunately some therapists tend to discuss this material with colleagues, supervisors, even sometimes at cocktail parties, all the while believing that they are behaving ethically because they only use the client's first name. Both the therapist and the initiator need to understand from the outset that such discussions must not occur. Initiation may be likened to an alchemical process: in order to be most effective, the vessel -the relationships with therapist and initiator -needs to be hermetically sealed. This is the primary reason that such great importance is given to secrecy and silence in esoteric matters. Silence creates power and pressure, which ultimately produce profound spiritual and psychologi- cal transformation. Whether the primary transference occurs with the initiator or the therapist is relatively unimportant. One never consciously decides to create a transferential relationship. It happens completely uncon-sciously, taking place with the person one is most able to fall in both love and hate with. What matters most is that it occur and that the 'r The earliest phase of the initiatic process of the first degree is symbol- ically depicted in a diagram called \"The Garden of Eden before the Fall\" (shown above). This diagram, which is presented to the initiate in the 3=8 grade of Practicus, represents a stage of primordial inno- cence. At this stage the candidate typically sees the initiator in an un-realistically positive light as a sort of ideal or perfect parent. In this diagram, Eve, the female figure shown at the bottom of the Tree of Life, represents the ideal mother (and the Qabalistic Nephesh or in- stinctual nature); she is depicted supporting the pillars of Jachin and Boaz. Adam, representing the ideal father (and the Qabalistic ruach negative projections and feelings be allowed to emerge and be safely worked through. or the rational aspect) stands above her with his chest at the station of Tiphareth, arms outstretched towards Chesed and Gevurah. This diagram represents the bliss of innocence: the candidate is liv- ing in a state of bliss because of his or her contact with the \"ideal par- ents\" as projected onto the initiator. This process is not unlike lung's portrayal of falling in love. According to Jung, when men fall in love,"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"654 The Ritual Mrzgic Manuul they project their own feminine side or anima onto the beloved, while women project the inner masculine, which Jung calls the animus. This is the stage that is most susceptible to abuse by inept or un- scrupulous initiators. Allegations of sexual harassment, manipulation, and other forms of abuse have surfaced, not merely surrounding leaders of occult orders, but in the mainstream religious community as well. As Jim Jones, David Koresh, and the Order of the Solar Temple have proven, this abuse of trust may even have fatal consequences. Certain safeguards, such as laws enforcing ethical guidelines, have been set up for psychotherapy. But as yet there are no such laws pro- tecting initiates in esoteric fraternities, though emotional, physical, or sexual abuse in these areas can be just as damaging. The decision to enter initiation may therefore be likened to the decision to enter psy- chotherapy, and the choice of a suitable initiator is at least as impor- tant as that of a good psychotherapist. In both choices individuals should be extremely judicious. A further examination of the diagram of \"The Garden of Eden before the Fall\" reveals the illusory nature of the relationship with the ideal parents. One notices first of all the absence of the Supernal Sephiroth (Kether, Binah, and Chokmah) on this Qabalistic Tree of Life: they are symbolized only in potential by the winged female fig- ure at the top of the Tree. This figure symbolizes the neshamah, or Di- vine Feminine, of the Qabalists. Furthermore Eve (the female figure at the foot of the Tree) stands upon a coiled seven-headed dragon. This dragon has a long history. It is to be found as early as the Pa- leolithic period in the form of the serpent associated with the consort of the Great Mother Goddesses as well as with her Tree of Life. This same serpent appears later in the Egyptian myths of Ra's struggles with the serpent-fiend Apep. In this same negative light it is encoun- tered yet again in the New Testament book of Revelation. Nonetheless the serpent remains an important symbol of resurrec- tion and the renewal of life, since it sheds its skin on a regular basis. When interpreted psychologically, this serpentine dragon represents what Jung calls the complexes of the personal unconscious. The unfolding initiatic process inevitably leads to the situation represented by the diagram entitled \"The Garden of Eden after the Fall\" (depicted below). This diagram is shown to the candidate during initiation into the 4=7 grade of Philosophus. Here the heads of the dragon arise into consciousness; as shown in the diagram, they attach themselves to the seven lower Sephiroth on the Tree of Life. At this phase the initiate's ego is assaulted by his or her personal complexes. Israel Regardie, The Golden Diiwn, and Psychotlzerapy 655 This is a necessary process for the awakening psyche, but it tends to be an unpleasant one. How many love affairs have ended in disappointment or tragedy? Both the psychotherapeutic and initiatic processes further expose the unresolved conflicts of early childhood. The beloved, who once was seen in an imaginarily positive light, now becomes invested in the op- posite fashion. The Queen of Heaven becomes the Hag, and the Fairy Prince becomes the Ogre. The same person who once \"could do no wrong\" suddenly \"can do no right.\" These negative projections are, of course, as unrealistic as the positive projections of the previous phase. It is crucial to the outcome of the initiation that the complexes of the personal unconscious be allowed to manifest in a safe and controlled way within the container of the relationship with the initiator. The emergence of these complexes can cause outbursts of irrational behavior in the candidate. This can be quite traumatic for the initiator as well as the candidate, as both frequently find themselves embroiled in the unresolved infantile drama of the candidate's early childhood. At this stage the skill of the initiator becomes crucial. He or she needs to be extremely conscious of what is happening, and sometimes must have"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"656 The Ritual Magic Manzral almost superhuman patience to endure the candidate's outbursts. This situation is complicated by what psychologists call \"countertransference,\" in which the initiator's own personal complexes are projected onto the candidate. Initiators and therapists should never assume that they have become completely conscious of their own inner processes; no matter how much one has grown, one is always vul- nerable to the further emergence of one's own unconscious material. The initiator may even erupt into outbursts of irrational behavior, which may further escalate the situation. This phase of initiation is also fertile ground for abuse by inept or unethical initiators, who may either be blinded by their own com- plexes or tempted to maintain the positive transference of the first stage. The adoration of students can easily seduce an initiator into at- tempting to maintain the illusory role of the charismatic, idealized patriarch or matriarch. But this would be poison to successful initia- tion and spiritual growth as well as to the health of any legitimate spiritual organization. Initiators must therefore resist this tendency at all costs; otherwise the initiation cannot progress beyond the phase symbolized by \"The Garden of Eden before the Fall.\" Furthermore, the negative transfer- ence inevitably arrives! If a leader is unable or unwilling to become a focal point for these unpleasant projections, he or she will find some other object for them to be projected onto. This leads to extremely unhealthy situations. Unscrupulous leaders are frequently obliged to find or create one or more scapegoats to serve as objects of the negative projections. This can lead to a pattern of abuse within, and expulsion from, the group. In the worst cases it leads to growing paranoia, as the scapegoat is projected onto an imaginary en- emy or even society at large. Waco, Texas and Cheiry, Switzerland have become monuments to the danger of this dynamic. At this point the esoteric community has placed far too little em- phasis on personal growth and group dynamics. Yet it must be remem- bered that any time one comes into contact with spiritual energies, the contents of the personal unconscious will become activated as well. Hence esoteric orders need to facilitate personal growth alongside spiritual growth. The dynamics of personal interactions within these groups needs to be examined as well. Throughout the first degree, the candidate was gradually entering into an entirely new relationship with his or her own Higher Self. In the early stages of the initiation, this relationship manifested chiefly through the unconscious projections onto the initiator. In the Portal Israel Regardie, The Golden Dawn, and Psychotherapy 657 Ritual of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the seeds were planted to enable the relationship of the candidate with the Higher Self to become fully conscious. This birth into consciousness then occurs with the entry into the Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis during the initiation into the 5=6 grade of Adeptus Minor. In the early part of this ritual, the candidate is symbolically bound to a cross (which symbolizes the elements). This voluntary subordina- tion of the ego to the Higher Self at length liberates the ego from the onslaught of the unconscious complexes. This is symbolized by the dropping away of the heads of the dragon from the Sephiroth (shown below). After this stage of the ritual, the candidate is brought inside the Vault of the Adepti for the first time. This vault, a highly charged magical chamber, is the symbolic burial place of Christian Rosenkreutz (Frater CRC). As a place where the initiate is reborn, the vault thus partakes not only of the symbolism of tomb but that of the womb as well. Once inside the vault the candidate is led to the head of the Pastos, the symbolic sarcophagus of Christian Rosenkreutz. When the lid of the Pastos is eventually removed to reveal the hidden figure of the"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"658 The Ritual Magic Manila1 Chief Adept (the initiator) inside, the candidate symbolically be- comes illuminated by an influx of consciousness coming from the Higher Self. The new adept thus begins to enter into an entirely new and fully conscious relationship with this Higher Self (as symbolized in the fol- lowing diagram). During this investigation we have gained an understanding of the psy- chological as well as the magical processes underlying legitimate ini- tiation. This, however, is not the end. Many years ago Regardie called for further exploration of the integration of psychology and magic. In fact, one might call the area of overlap between these two fields \"Eso- terlc Psychology.\" This inquiry has been an attempt to make a small contribution to this emerging new field. The work, however, is just be- ginning. Standing at the vantage point of the end of the millennium, ten years after Regardie's death, we feel obliged to repeat his appeal for further research: \"Whoever does succeed in welding these two [psychology and magic] indissolubly together, to him mankind will ever be grateful.\" APPENDIX VI Bibliography Works on the Golden Dawn Magical System Brodie-Imes, J.
