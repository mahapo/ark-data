It isalso one of the least well-understood topics in Crowley’s corpus, arguablydue in part to the sometimes ambiguous ways in which he presented it.Numerous interpretations of the Holy Guardian Angel abound, from the‘subconscious’ and a ‘projection of the personality’ at one end of the scale,through to an actual extraterrestrial alien at the other.The objective of this essay is to engage in a comprehensive and thor-ough review of the occasions where Aleister Crowley wrote about the HolyGuardian Angel in his published works of prose in an attempt to derivea definitive account of what he actually meant when he used that term.A Bird’s Eye ViewIn order to frame the discussion that will follow, we will need to begin byexamining at a high level the place that Crowley gave the ‘Holy GuardianAngel’ in the overall scheme of his philosophy and world view, the relativeimportance he ascribed to it in comparison with other ‘magical’ concepts,and the significance of the term itself. Since, for this purpose, we areprimarily interested in what Aleister Crowley actually wrote, this firstsection will inevitably be relatively quotation-heavy.KCHGA as the ‘Great Work’Critical to understanding the role of the Holy Guardian Angel in AleisterCrowley’s philosophy and work is to realise its absolutely central position.He equated ‘Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel’with the ‘Great Work’, and made it the central objective of the magicalsystem of training in the outer order of his A∴A∴organisation. InOneStar in Sight— a ‘detailed account’ of ‘the structure and system of theGreat White Brotherhood’1— Crowley explained that:1i.e. the A∴A∴3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4The Grade of Adeptus Minor is the main theme of the in-structions of the A∴A∴It is characterised by the Attainmentof the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian An-gel. This is the essential work of every man; none other rankswith it either for personal progress or for power to help one’sfellows. This unachieved, man is no more than the unhappiestand blindest of animals. He is conscious of his own incom-prehensible calamity, and clumsily incapable of repairing it.Achieved, he is no less than the co-heir of the gods, a Lordof Light. He is conscious of his own consecrated course, andconfidently ready to run it.Crowley continued to stress the central importance of KCHGA right untilthe end of his life, writing in his last work,Magick Without Tears, that:It should never be forgotten for a single moment that the cen-tral and essential work of the Magicians is the attainment ofthe Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.He explicitly linked KCHGA and the ‘Great Work’ in Chapter ΓΛ ofLiber Aleph:This Great Work is the Attainment of the Knowledge andConversation of thine Holy Guardian Angel.as well as in Chapter III ofMagick in Theory and Practice:It is the second half of the formula2which symbolises the GreatWork which we are pledged to accomplish. The first step ofthis is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation ofthe Holy Guardian Angel, which constitutes the Adept of theInner Order.The key is to understand that when Crowley used the term ‘HolyGuardian Angel’ within the context of his A∴A∴organisation and withinthe context of his overall program of ‘magical’ training, he used it to referto a concept of individual attainment, of ‘personal progress’, and of self-development. The importance of this fact will become clear later in thisessay.The HGA and the ‘True Will’The usage of the term within the context of ‘personal progress’ becomeseven more striking when we observe that Crowley also used ‘Holy GuardianAngel’ to refer to the ‘True Will’, or to the revelation of that will. Thisis perhaps stated most clearly inHeart of the Master, where he explainsthat:2i.e. the formula of Tetragrammaton."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5The Way of Perfection is thus twofold: first, the True Willmust be consciously grasped by the Mind, and this Work isakin to that called the attainment of the Knowledge and Con-versation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Second, as it is written:‘Thou hast no right but to do thy will,’3each particle of energywhich the Instrument4is able to develop must be directed tothe doing of that WillThe connection is again explicitly made in his ‘new comment’5to AL I,7:So also our own Silent Self,6helpless and witless, hidden withinus, will spring forth, if we have craft to loose him to the Light,spring lustily forward with his cry of Battle, the Word of ourTrue Wills. This is the Task of the Adept, to have the Knowl-edge and Conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel, to becomeaware of his nature and his purpose, fulfilling them.and in his ‘new comment’ to AL II, 65:It is curious that this verse should be numbered 65, suggestingL.V.X.,7and Adonai, the Holy Guardian Angel. It seems thatHe is Hadit. I have never liked the term ‘Higher Self’;8TrueSelf is more the idea. For each Star is the husk of Hadit,unique and conqueror, sublime in His own virtue, independentof Hierarchy.where he defines the Holy Guardian Angel as the ‘True Self’, of which thewill is ‘but the dynamic aspect’.9He further identifies the Holy GuardianAngel as ‘Hadit’, and asserts that ‘each Star’ — i.e. ‘every man and everywoman’10— is the ‘husk of Hadit’. That is to say, the Holy GuardianAngel is within each person, and not external to them.In Chapter XVIII ofMagick in Theory and Practicehe further explainsthat:It should go without saying that until the Magician has at-tained to the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian3AL I, 424i.e. the mind.5Written in 1920 and privately published in 1926 asAn Extenuation of The Bookof the Law.6We will return to the idea of the ‘Silent Self’ later in this essay.7LXV, as opposed to ‘L.V.X.’, is 65 represented in Roman numerals, and is the enu-meration ofLiber Cordis Cincti Serpente, an ‘account of the relations of the Aspirantwith his Holy Guardian Angel’.8The subject of the ‘Higher Self’ also comes in for further investigation later in thisessay.9The Message of the Master Therion.10AL I, 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6Angel he is liable to endless deceptions. He does not knowHimselfand the identification is made very directly inLiber Samekh, the ‘Ritualemployed by the Beast 66611for the Attainment of the Knowledge andConversation of his Holy Guardian Angel’ (emphasis added):the Adept will be free to concentrate his deepest self, thatpart of him which unconsciously orders his true Will, uponthe realization of his Holy Guardian Angel. . .For his Angelis an intelligible image of his own true Will, to do whichis the whole of the law of his Being.Significantly — as we shall discover later in this essay — Crowley alsomakes the identification in Chapter 7 ofThe Equinox of the Gods:Teeth are displayed when our Secret Self — our SubconsciousEgo, whose Magical Image is our individuality expressed inmental and bodily form — our Holy Guardian Angel — comesforth and declares our True Will to our fellows, whether tosnarl or to sneer, to smile or to laugh.It is worth pointing out that although the HGA forms the subject ofLiber Cordis Cincti Serpente— one of the three most important ‘HolyBooks’ of Thelema — the term never actually appears inThe Book ofthe Law. It is Crowley’s equation of the Holy Guardian Angel with therevelation of the ‘True Will’ which provides the linkage between the term— which might otherwise be seen as a strictly ‘magical’ idea rather thana ‘Thelemic’ oneper se— and Thelema.HGA as an ‘Absurd’ TermIn Chapter II ofMagick in Theory and PracticeCrowley wrote that:He who became the Master Therion was once confronted bythis very difficulty.12Being determined to instruct mankind,He sought a simple statement of his object. His will was suf-ficiently informed by common sense to decide him to teachman ‘The Next Step’, the thing which was immediately abovehim. He might have called this ‘God’, or ‘The Higher Self’,or ‘The Augœides’, or ‘Adi-Buddha’, or 6113other things —but He had discovered that these were all one, yet that each11i.e. Crowley.12i.e. the difficulty of ‘avoid[ing] the clouding of the mind by doubt and metaphysicalspeculation’.13Which, together with the four listed, would sum to 65, the number of NVIT andthe enumeration given toLiber Cordis Cincti Serpenteas we have already noted."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7one represented some theory of the Universe which would ulti-mately be shattered by criticism — for He had already passedthrough the realm of Reason, and knew that every statementcontained an absurdity. He therefore said: ‘Let me declarethis work under this title: “The obtaining of the Knowledgeand Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel”’, because thetheory implied in these words is so patently absurd that onlysimpletons would waste much time in analysing it. It wouldbe accepted as a convention, and no one would incur the gravedanger of building a philosophical system upon it.This is echoed back in 1909 in the first volume ofThe Equinox, whereJ.F.C. Fuller quotes a letter from Crowley in the first installment ofTheTemple of Solomon the King:Abramelin calls him Holy Guardian Angel. I adopt this:1. Because Abramelin’s system is so simple and effective.2. Because sincealltheories of the universe are absurd itis better to talk in the language of one which is patentlyabsurd, so as to mortify the metaphysical man.3. Because a child can understand it.Clearly Crowley thought the ‘theory implied in these words’ — thatis, that there really is an ‘angel’ somewhere out there in the universe whohas been specially appointed to watch over one — is ‘patently absurd’. Somuch so, in fact, that ‘no one would incur the grave danger of building aphilosophical system on it.’ As it happens, it appears Crowley may havesuccumbed to an unjustified degree of optimism, here, because it turnsout that many people do indeed ‘[build] a philosophical system’ on theliteral ‘theory implied in these words.’***From our ‘bird’s eye view’, therefore, we can see that Crowley:•identified the attainment of the ‘Knowledge and Conversation of theHoly Guardian Angel’ with the performance of the ‘Great Work’;•identified the attainment of the ‘Knowledge and Conversation of theHoly Guardian Angel’ with the revelation of the ‘True Will’; and•adopted the term ‘Holy Guardian Angel’ as a deliberately ‘absurd’convention, and intended for no philosophical or metaphysical sig-nificance to be placed upon it.With these observations in mind, we may proceed to a more detaileddiscussion."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8The ‘Subjective-Objective’ DebateWhen the concept of the ‘Holy Guardian Angel’ becomes a subject of dis-cussion within the ‘magical’ or ‘occult’ communities, it is usually framedin terms of what we may call the ‘Subjective-Objective Debate’. It isoften claimed that Aleister Crowley changed his mind on the matter ofthe Holy Guardian Angel throughout his life, sometimes describing it ina ‘subjective’ sense to refer to something purely within the consciousnessof the individual, and sometimes describing it as an ‘objective individ-ual’ in an entirely external sense. It is one of the goals of this essay todemonstrate that distinction to be something of a false dichotomy, and toshow that Crowley’s representation was relatively consistent throughouthis life, even if he didn’t always go out of his way to make that clear.Before we can do that, we must again begin by examining what the manactually said that gave rise to this view, and we will begin by looking atthe ‘objective’ side.The ‘Objective’ HGAThe bulk of the remarks held to support the ‘objective’ side of the debatecome fromMagick Without Tears, and it is often claimed that this work,being Crowley’s last, represents a more ‘mature’ presentation of his ideason the HGA and therefore should take precedence and ‘overrule’ his pre-vious works.14This is a very superficial view, however, since as we shalllater see15he also continues to present the ‘subjective’ side of the debatein the very same work. But, we are getting ahead of ourselves; let’s lookat the remarks in question first, and then consider them in the context ofthe debate.The granddaddy of them all comes in a letter entitled ‘The HolyGuardian Angel is not the “Higher Self” but an Objective Individual’:the Holy Guardian Angel. . . is something more than a man,possibly a being who has already passed through the stageof humanity, and his peculiarly intimate relationship with hisclient is that of friendship, of community, or brotherhood, orFatherhood. He is not, let me say with emphasis, a mere ab-straction from yourself; and that is why I have insisted ratherheavily that the term ‘Higher Self’ implies ‘a damnable heresyand a dangerous delusion.’ If it were not so, there would beno point in The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage. Apart14It would be equally easy to argue that this one work is a dubious anomaly, thathe was ‘losing it’ towards the end of his life, or that he was tailoring his message to arank beginner, or that he was experimenting with a more ‘religious’ presentation afterhis earlier, more rational attempts at ‘Scientific Illuminism’ failed to attract a largenumber of adherents, but we have a duty to at least try to take Crowley at his word.15See page 28."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9from any theoretical speculation, my Sammasati16and analyt-ical work17has never led to so much as a hint of the existenceof the Guardian Angel. He is not to be found by any explo-ration of oneself.There are three components of this comment which we will examineseparately:•the ‘Higher Self’ as a ‘damnable heresy’;•the ‘point’ ofThe Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage; and•the idea of an ‘objective individual’.A Damnable HeresyIn seeking to understand what Crowley meant when he described theconcept of the ‘Higher Self’ as ‘a damnable heresy and a dangerous delu-sion’ it will be useful to appeal to precedent, because this letter is notthe first time he discussed it. Indeed, he spoke of it elsewhere inMag-ick Without Tears, in the immediately preceding letter titled ‘This “Self”Introversion’:We may readily concur that the Augœides, the ‘Genius’ ofSocrates, and the ‘Holy Guardian Angel’ of Abramelin theMage, are identical. But we cannot include this ‘Higher Self’;for the Angel is an actual Individual with his own Universe,exactly as a man is; or, for the matter of that, a bluebottle.He is not a mere abstraction from, and exaltation of, one’sown favourite qualities, as the ‘Higher Self’ seems to be.and also over twenty years earlier in his ‘new comment’ to AL I, 65 as wehave already seen:It is curious that this verse should be numbered 65, suggestingL.V.X., and Adonai, the Holy Guardian Angel. It seems thatHe is Hadit. I have never liked the term ‘Higher Self’; TrueSelf is more the idea. For each Star is the husk of Hadit,unique and conqueror, sublime in His own virtue, independentof Hierarchy.16The seventh element of the Buddhist ‘Noble Eightfold Path’, and referring to‘mindfulness’, or awareness of one’s bodily functions, feelings, and the contents of one’sconsciousness. Jeffrey Block described it as ‘bare attention, a detached observationof what is happening within us and around us in the present moment.’ Crowley’simplication here is that the Holy Guardian Angel — and the ‘True Self’ — does notconsist of our thoughts, feelings or awareness, but exists somehow outside of that.We shall return to this idea later when we give deeper consideration to the idea of‘independent intelligence’.17i.e. ‘Vipassana’, referring to self-observation and introspection, again emphasisingthat the Holy Guardian Angel exists outside of the mind."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10There are two important points to be gleaned from these extracts. Thefirst is that it refutes the idea that Crowley’s dismissal of the ‘Higher Self’notion of the Holy Guardian Angel represents a change in his position onthe subject, because we can clearly see that he was opposed to the use ofthe term as early as 1920 when the ‘new comment’ was written. Theremay be other evidence to suspect that Crowley changed his mind, and weshall examine this matter presently, but we note here that the remarksagainst the ‘Higher Self’ do not themselves support such a view.The second is that by dismissing the idea of the Holy Guardian An-gel as the ‘Higher Self’, it is evident that Crowley isnotdismissing the‘internal’ or ‘subjective’ idea of the Angel in its entirety. We will discussthe ‘Augœides’ and ‘the “Genius” of Socrates’ in more detail later in thisessay, being content to remark here that they are definitely ‘internal’ con-cepts, and Crowley openly states — inMagick Without Tearsitself, inthe letter immediately preceding the one where he proposes the ‘objec-tive individual’ idea — that they are ‘identical’ with the Holy GuardianAngel. Crowley’s identification of the Angel with the ‘True Self’ is evenmore conclusive, since it would be nonsensical to suppose that our ‘TrueSelf’ could be an entirely separate and external being. This also cementsfurther the fact that Crowley didnot‘change his mind’ about the natureof the Holy Guardian Angel inMagick Without Tears, because in thatwork we can clearly see him defining the Angel in the same ‘subjective’sense that he did many times earlier in his career, and which we will seelater. At the most one could suggest that Crowley contradicted himselfin that work, butMagick Without Tearscannot be used as evidence infavour of an argument that he ‘changed his mind’.Clearly, when Crowley railed against the use of the term ‘Higher Self’in relation to the Holy Guardian Angel, he was not dismissing the ‘sub-jective’ view at all, but merelyone typeof ‘subjective’ view. He also tellsus precisely which type of view he’s talking about: ‘a mere abstractionfrom, and exaltation of, one’s own favourite qualities.’The ‘Higher Self’ view of the Angel is one that is not uncommonlyencountered. For instance, Will Parfitt suggests the following criteria forevaluating the veracity of encounters with the Angel:Does the scene look right? Do you sense the rightness of thesymbols involved? Is the expression of your Angel right?18Similarly, a 2008 forum post onLAShTAL.comquoted the following froman online text calledThe Principles of White Magic:19one of the most common questions posed by aspiring mysticsand magicians is, ‘But how do I know if this is real informa-18The Living Qabalah.19Located athttp://blazing-diamond.angelfire.com/101over.htm, retrieved March 7,2010, and presumably written by the author of the post referencing it."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11tion? How do I know if the message is coming from my higherself or some advanced being, or is it simply a product of mywishful thinking and power of imagination? It could be thatI am just kidding myself.’and continued to give one answer:if a message intuitively internally ‘rings true’ it should be ac-cepted as being trueBoth of these extracts exemplify the problem Crowley was talking about inequating the Holy Guardian Angel with ‘a mere abstraction from. . . one’sown favourite qualities’, as they both recommend evaluating the ‘commu-nications’ from the Angel in terms ofwhat already ‘feels right’, andwhatalready ‘rings true’. In the same letter20fromMagick Without Tears,Crowley says that:one should insist on definite communication of knowledge (orwhat not) which is incontestably not one’s own. The factthat the self-begotten feelings are so eminently satisfactory —naturally, since there is nobody to oppose them — is damnablyseductive. Once started on that road, one can easily developself-deception to a fine art.We have already seen that Crowley used the term Holy GuardianAngel in the context of a system of self-development, and the most obviousrequirement of such a system is that it must not merely exalt that whichwe already know and feel; if any real development is to take place, then anysuitable system must involve a definite departure from that. We have alsoalready seen that Crowley identified the attainment of the Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel with the revelation of the ‘TrueWill’; the very idea that such a revelation could be necessary presupposesthat we do not initially know what that ‘True Will’ is, and we may supposethat things will remain that way if we insist on accepting or rejectingcommunications from that will based on what we already think aboutourselves, and on what we already think we value.When the term ‘Higher Self’ is used in practice, it is presented asbeing the source from which one’s ‘higher’ values or qualities originate,while the regular old self is polluted with one’s so-called ‘lower’ or ‘baser’values or qualities which prevent one’s ‘Higher Self’ from being the solebasis of conduct. In other words, the idea is that one already knows whatone ‘should’ do, and the difficulty involved in ‘attaining’ boils down toconsistently doing it. This is entirely consistent with the Christian viewof ‘sin’ as described by St. Paul in his Epistle to the Romans, 7:14–20:20i.e. ‘This “Self” Introversion’"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, soldunder sin. For that which I do I allow not: for what I would,that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. If then I do thatwhich I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. Nowthen it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no goodthing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform thatwhich is good I find not. For the good that I would I do not:but the evil which I would not, that I do. Now if I do that Iwould not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth inme.This is diametrically opposed to the doctrines of Thelema, which holdthat the essential ‘problem’ of attainment is not being unable to act inthe way that is known to be ‘proper’, but being unaware of — or mistakenabout — what is ‘proper’ in the first place. The introduction toMagickin Theory and Practicestates that:The most common cause of failure in life is ignorance of one’sown True Will. . . A man may think it is his duty to act ina certain way, through having made a fancy picture of him-self, instead of investigating his actual nature. For example,a woman may make herself miserable for life by thinking thatshe prefers love to social consideration, or vice versa. Onewoman may stay with an unsympathetic husband when shewould really be happy in an attic with a lover, while anothermay fool herself into a romantic elopement when her only plea-sures are those of presiding over fashionable functions. Again,a boy’s instinct may tell him to go to sea, while his parentsinsist on his becoming a doctor. In such a case he will be bothunsuccessful and unhappy in medicine.If we are to discover this ‘True Will’ — which, again, Crowley identi-fied with the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel — then it is of primary importance that we donotsim-ply ‘[exalt]. . . one’s own favourite qualities’ since it is that collection of‘favourite qualities’ — the ‘fancy picture’ we make for ourselves — whichobscures the will from us in the first place, but this is exactly what hap-pens when we seriously entertain the notion of a ‘Higher Self’. In reality,‘higher’ almost inevitably boils down to ‘stuff I think is neat’, and ‘lower’boils down to ‘stuff I don’t like much’. One’s conception of a ‘HigherSelf’ will be comprised of those qualities which one already prefers, andif we aspire to that ‘Higher Self’ then we are doing nothing but aspiringto just the kind of ‘fancy picture’ Crowley warned against inMagick inTheory and Practice. In reality, the actual process of attaining to theKnowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel reveals things"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13about the self that not only did we not suspect — i.e. that do not al-ready ‘ring true’ — but which we would positively prefernotto be true.The practice of self-investigation21routinely reveals uncomfortable anddisconcerting truths about one’s own being which contradict the ‘fancypicture’ one has made for oneself and which one would often rather notconfront, but which onemustconfront if any meaningful development isto take place.Independent IntelligenceIndeed, this is exactly what Crowley was referring to when he said that,otherwise, ‘there would be no point in The Sacred Magic of Abramelinthe Mage’, such point being that ‘one should insist on definite communi-cation of knowledge (or what not) which is incontestably not one’s own’as we have already seen. This was echoed years earlier in an appendixtoMagick in Theory and Practiceentitled ‘Notes on the nature of the“Astral Plane”’ (emphasis in the original):Nothing is easier than to suggest visions, or to fashion phan-tasms to suit one’s ideas. It is obviously impossible to commu-nicate with an independent intelligence — the one real objectof astral research — if one allows one’s imagination to sur-round one with courtiers of one’s own creation. . .The essence of the right sensation consists in recog-nition of the reality of the other Being. There will beas a rule some element of hostility,22even when thereaction is sympathetic. One’s ‘soul-mate’ (even) isnot thought of as oneself, at first contact.One must therefore insist that any real appearance of theAstral Plane gives the sensation of meeting a stranger. Onemust accept it as independent, be it Archangel or Elf, andmeasure one’s own reaction to it. One must learn from it,though one despise it; and love it, however one loathe it.One must realize, on writing up the record, that the meet-ing has effected a definite change in oneself. One must haveknown and felt something alien,23and not merely tried on anew dress.21This does not contradict Crowley’s earlier statement that the Holy Guardian Angel‘is not to be found by any exploration of oneself’, since Crowley is using the term‘oneself’ to refer to what we might call theconscious‘self’, or the contents of themind, whereas we are using the term to refer to investigating the nature of thetrueself. This distinction in examined in more depth on page 27.22Again disputing the idea that communications from the Holy Guardian Angel canbe evaluated against what ‘feels right’.23For the avoidance of doubt, ‘alien’ in this context means ‘strange’ or ‘foreign’, anddoes not imply ‘extraterrestrial’."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14Before we examine the meaning of terms such as ‘independent intelli-gence’ in detail, we will first consider Aleister Crowley’s own words onthe ‘reality’ of such ‘intelligences’.In Chapter XVIII ofMagick in Theory and Practice, Crowley made thefollowing remarks about the ‘Body of Light’ and ‘astral travel’ (emphasisadded):It24is of course not ‘real’. . . Before treating of clairvoyanceone must briefly discuss this question of reality, for misappre-hension on the subject has given rise to endless trouble.There is the story of the American in the train who sawanother American carrying a basket of unusual shape. Hiscuriosity mastered him, and he leant across and said: ‘Say,stranger, what you got in that bag?’ The other, lantern-jawedand taciturn, replied: ‘mongoose’. The first man was ratherbaffled, as he had never heard of a mongoose. After a pause hepursued, at the risk of a rebuff: ‘But say, what is a Mongoose?’‘Mongoose eats snakes’, replied the other. This was anotherposer, but he pursued: ‘What in hell do you want a Mongoosefor?’ ‘Well, you see’, said the second man (in a confidentialwhisper) ‘my brother sees snakes’. The first man was morepuzzled than ever; but after a long think, he continued ratherpathetically: ‘But say, them ain’t real snakes’. ‘Sure’, said theman with the basket, ‘but this Mongoose ain’t real either’.This is a perfect parable of Magick.and follows this up in ‘Notes on the nature of the “Astral Plane”’ with(emphasis in the original):It ismore convenientto assume the objective existence ofan ‘Angel’ who gives us new knowledge. . .The ‘reality’ or ‘objectivity’ of these symbols is not perti-nent to the discussion. The ideas of X to the 4th power andsquare root of -1 have proved useful to the progress of mathe-matical advance toward Truth; it is no odds whether a FourthDimension ‘exists’, or whether square root of -1 has ‘meaning’in the sense that square root of 4 has, the number of units inthe side of a square of 4 units.The Astral Plane — real or imaginary — is a danger toanybody who takes it without the grain of salt contained inthe Wisdom of the above point of view. . .We must not assert the ‘reality’ or ‘objectivity’ ofan Astral Being on no better evidence than the subjec-tive sensation of its independent existence. We must24i.e. the ‘Body of Light’."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15insist on proof patent to all qualified observers if weare to establish the major premise of Religion: thatthere exists a Conscious Intelligence independent ofbrain and nerve as we know them.25Earlier in this essay26we saw that Crowley’s dismissal of the term‘Higher Self’ inMagick Without Tearscould not be interpreted as a‘change in position’ since he was equally dismissive of the same termover twenty years early in his ‘new comment’ toThe Book of the Law.The above extracts show that the same can be said of ‘objective’ Angels;Crowley was putting forward the same ideas as far back as 1921 when‘Notes on the nature of the “Astral Plane”’ was written.27More importantly we can see that in ‘Notes on the nature of the “As-tral Plane”’, where Crowley talked very explicitly about ‘independentintelligences’, he repeatedly insists on the point that the ‘“reality” or“objectivity”’ of such things as ‘Angels’ is ‘not pertinent’ — more thanthat, he admonishes that ‘we must not assert the “reality” or “objec-tivity”’ of such beings without ‘proof patent to all qualified observers.’Indeed, he carries this idea of the irrelevance of the Angel’s ‘reality’ rightthe way through toMagick Without Tearsitself, saying in the letter ‘DoAngels Ever Cut Themselves Shaving?’:Are we to conclude that the whole set of impressions is nomore than symbolic? Is it all a part of oneself, like a daydream,but a daydream intensified and made ‘real’ because its crucialincidents turn out to be true, as much always occur duringthe testing of the genuineness of the vision?. . . It seems to memuch simpler to say that these Angels are ‘real’ individuals,although living in a world whose laws we have no conception;and that, in order to communicate with us, they make use ofthe symbolic forms appropriatestressing that the adoption of terminology such as ‘Angel’ is nothing morethan a convenience, a position taken for simplicity.28Thus, while Crowleytalks easily of ‘objective individuals’ and ‘independent intelligences’ he25Crowley then goes on to argue thatThe Book of the Lawprovides just such ‘proofpatent’. While this is certainly an assertion worthy of skeptical consideration, suchconsideration is beyond the scope of the present essay.26On page 10.27Although it wasn’t published until 1929 when it appeared as an appendix toMagickin Theory and Practice.28For the sake of completeness, we should note that some in the ‘objective’ campmay take exception to our omission of two sentences from the middle of the aboveextract: ‘I’m sorry, but I can’t let it go at that! Some of my own experiences havebeen so confoundedly objective that it just won’t work.’ While not being good forappearances, the existence of these sentences does not change the fact that Crowleyemployed the ‘much simpler’ argument in the same paragraph. Indeed, immediatelyafter the quoted extract he wrote to his correspondent: ‘Ha! Ha! Ha! I suppose"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16goes out of his way in those same works to stress that one should notattempt to assert the ‘reality’ of such things. Thus we can conclude on thegrounds of Crowley’s own words that his assertion that the Holy GuardianAngel is an ‘objective individual’ or an ‘independent intelligence’ need notimply an assertion that it is a wholly independent and external ‘being’existing entirely separately from the individual having the ‘vision’.As Crowley said in Chapter VII ofMagick in Theory and Practice,‘it would be childish to cling to the belief that Marius de Aquila29actu-ally existed’, and it would be equally childish to cling to the belief that‘Angels’ actually are honest-to-goodness ‘præternatural beings’. Yet theideas of ‘objective individuals’ and ‘independent intelligences’ do reinforcethe dangers we spoke of in the previous section in relation to the conceptof the ‘Higher Self’, and Crowley did repeatedly refer to such ideas, sowe cannot merely dismiss them. Having shown that Crowley was at leastnot asserting the existence of ‘real beings’,30we can turn our attention towhat such concepts actually might mean. Before we can do that, though,we must consider the meaning of ‘objective individual’.An Objective IndividualThe ‘The Holy Guardian Angel is not the “Higher Self” but an Objec-tive Individual’ letter inMagick Without Tearsdeals primarily with thequestion of what order of existence ‘angels’ belong to, and particularly‘whether they are liable to accident, misfortune and the like.’As soon as we reach the second paragraph of that letter we are in-stantly hit with the problem of understanding the distinction between‘subjective’ and ‘objective’. This distinction can have many shades ofmeaning, and it is important when dealing with this matter to not con-fuse those shades; in other words, to not take a statement couched in thoseterms in the context of one shade of meaning, and then inappropriatelyextend it to falsely cover others.The infamous ‘objective individual’ paragraph from that letter can beseen in a very different light when we examine it in the context of thewhole letter in which it appears. In that letter, Crowley says that:for the purposes of this letter I propose to use the word ‘angel’to include all sorts of disembodied beings, from demons toyou think you’ve caught me out in an evasion there!’ showing that even he wasn’tconvinced by the strength of support for his ‘objective’ comments. He does go on tosay ‘Not so, dear child, not so,’ but is forced to resort to comparisons with ‘What do Iknow of Therion’s mode of life?’ to argue that ‘reality’ is no different, which of courseit is.29A Roman that Crowley claimed to have been in a ‘past life’.30In this context, at least. In other contexts, most notably when talking aboutAiwass, he certainly did appear to assert this."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17gods — in all cases, they areobjective; a subjective ‘angel’ isdifferent from a dream only in non-essentials.Let us first not get too caught up in the term ‘disembodied’; par-ticularly let us not make the mistake of thinking that this necessarilyentails the existence of actual living beings without bodies in the sensethat Christians believe their god to exist, for instance. For illustration,let us take the example of Zeus. Zeus fits the description ‘disembodiedbeing’ — in the first place, he is known to be the King of the Gods inGreek mythology, who rules the sky, consorted with Hera, had at leasttwo elder brothers, fathered children, and performed all manner of otherindividual acts consistent with being, well, a ‘being’. In the second place,he is clearly ‘disembodied’, if for no other reason than the obvious factthat he doesn’t actually exist in a physical sense.So what means ‘objective’ in this sense? Simply that anybody so in-clined can independently discover any number of qualities, characteristicsand stories about Zeus by consulting a large body of literary and othersources. Regardless of the fact that he doesn’t physically exist, in thissense he has ‘known’ characteristics and there are relatively definite leg-ends about some of his antics. The same cannotbe said of Crowley’s‘subjective angel’ which is ‘different from a dream only in non-essentials’and is accessible only to one particular individual.This is important to grasp. ‘Objective’, in this sense, does not meanthat one can grab hold of Zeus and give him a sharp slap to the backof the head. It simply indicates the presence of objective qualities whichexist independently of any one given individual. If a given individualclaimed that Zeus was not the King of the Gods, but rather a lowly cabinetmaker from Nuneaton, that individual’s error could be relatively easilydemonstrated. Yet with Crowley’s ‘subjective angel’ who is known only toone single perceiver this cannot be done. ‘Objective’canmean somethingexisting entirely separately fromanybody’sconsciousness, butin this caseit does not in fact mean that. To take the above quotation and arguethat Crowley was necessarily implying that some angels actually do existentirely separately from anybody’s consciousness is to argue that the Bookof Genesis doesn’t really describe the ‘Fall of Man’ because it contains noaccount of Adam stumbling over a rock and bruising his knee. Neither isit any escape to argue that Genesis does not describe the ‘Fall of Man’because no such thing actually happened; Conan Doyle’s stories describesomething of the life and times of Sherlock Holmes, and this statementloses none of its truth with the observation that Sherlock Holmes neveractually lived. It is very easy to become confused over terms in such amanner, and one must constantly be on one’s guard against doing so.With this in mind, Crowley continues to distinguish between ‘angels’which are ‘microcosms’, and angels which are not. With regards to thefirst:"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18some angels are actually emanations of the elements, planets,or signs to which they are attributed. They are partial be-ings in very much the same way as are animals. They arenot microcosms as are men and women. They are almost en-tirely composed of the planet (or whatever it is) to which theyare attributed. . . In the above case, evidently his existence de-pends on that of the planet Venus; and one might supposethat, if that planet were stricken from the solar system, therewould be no more Qedemel. But this is to judge too rashly;for Venus itself is only an emanation of the number 7, andis therefore indestructible. . . It is some such idea as the abovewhich is at the back of the conventional idea that elementalsare immortal, that they incur mortality when their ambitionand devotion causes them to incarnate as human beings.The ‘some such idea as the above’ to which Crowley is referring isthe fact that these ‘non-microcosmic angels’ are merely representationsof something else, and when that ‘something else’ is eternal, so are the‘angels’ which are actually merely labels for them. Crowley says thatthere are ‘many Eastern stories of the destruction of dryads or Nats bythe cutting down of the tree in which they have made their habitation’— naturally, because the spirit in question is defined entirely as being thespirit of that tree, and when that tree is gone, it cannot have a spirit. Onthe other hand, a ‘spirit of thunder’ is going to be far less susceptible toharm, because although you can cut down as many trees as you like, youwon’t be able to get rid of thunder so easily.Thus, a ‘non-microcosmic angel’ can be ‘objective’ in the sense that itis a personification of a definite thing — such as thunder, or a specific tree— which qualities can be reliably detected by anyone who cares to look,and it can still be ‘objective’ even if there is no actual physical spirit,since it is merely a label for something that actually is physically ‘outthere’. This is what is meant by ‘some angels are actually emanationsof the elements, planets, or signs to which they are attributed’; they areactually ‘emanations’ of those things, because they are, in fact, nothingmore than convenient labels for those things, or at least for particularaspects of those things. These spirits are inseparable from those aspects,because this is how they are defined.Then, on the other hand, we have ‘microcosmic angels’, who:are microcosms in exactly the same sense as men and womenare. They are individuals who have picked up the elementsof their composition as possibility and convenience dictates,exactly as we do ourselves. I want you to understand that agoddess like Astarte, Astaroth, Cotytto, Aphrodite, Hathoor,Venus, are not merely aspects of the planet; they are separate"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19individuals who have been identified with each other, and at-tributed to Venus merely because the salient feature in theircharacter approximates to this ideal.Zeus would be an example. Zeus is not just a personification of thesky, or of thunder — he is a definite individual with his own personality,foibles, tendencies, and characteristics, all of which are defined by legend,and this conglomeration of attributes is larger than any specific objector phenomenon with which he is associated. Once more, this descrip-tion survives the observation that Zeus isn’t ‘real’, in the same way thatthe statement ‘Sherlock Holmes was a man’ survives the observation thathe wasn’t ‘real’, either. Such imaginary individuals ‘have picked up theelements of their composition as possibility and convenience dictates’ be-cause those elements are created over time by people, and over time theseelements change, are added to, are blended with those of other mythologi-cal individuals, so as to make those personalities alter and grow over time,in exactly the same way that the personalities of real living individualsdo.The presentation of this type of ‘disembodied being’ as an ‘objectiveindividual’ should, therefore, in no way be taken to mean that this type ofangel is an actual existing being in the same way that the people walkingthe earth today are. This type of presentation is entirely consistent witha wholly imaginary being, and all that is required for the ‘objectivity’that Crowley is talking about is that the characteristics of that imaginarybeing be more or less agreed-upon and determinable.31To argue thatCrowley actually thought that ‘Astarte, Astaroth, Cotytto, Aphrodite,Hathoor [and] Venus’ were real existing beings is wishful thinking in theextreme, especially when we have passages such as:Thus, when we say that Nakhiel is the ‘Intelligence’ of the Sun,we do not mean that he lives in the Sun, but only that he hasa certain rank and character; and although we can invoke him,we do not necessarily mean that he exists in the same senseof the word in which our butcher exists.inMagick in Theory and Practicetelling us what Crowley actually didmean.***Our examination of Crowley’s comments on the ‘objective’ side of thedebate have therefore revealed four important points:31When talking about the Holy Guardian Angel, it is the very fact that these charac-teristics are ‘determinable’ — and are therefore not wholly invented by the aspirant’sown mind, even if he were to be the only individual with the practical ability to observeand determine them — that allows the aspirant to have ‘known and felt somethingalien, and not merely tried on a new dress’."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20•Crowley’s remarks inMagick Without Tearswhich are often held toexemplify a ‘change in position’ by Crowley on the subject of the‘reality’ of the Holy Guardian Angel in fact do no such thing, sincewe can see that all the positions outlined in those remarks were alsobeing outlined by Crowley at least twenty years earlier;•Crowley’s dismissal of the term ‘Higher Self’ as a description of theHoly Guardian Angel does not invalidateany‘internal’ or ‘subjec-tive’ view of the Angel, merely one view which consists of ‘a mereabstraction from, and exaltation of, one’s own favourite qualities’;•Crowley’s use of the term ‘objective individual’, when read in thecontext of the entire letter in which that term appears, need notbe — and is apparently not intended to be — understood as anassertion that the Holy Guardian Angel is a ‘real, external being’wholly separate from the aspirant; and•Crowley’s concept of ‘communicating’ with something ‘independent’is of critical importance to the attainment of the Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, since this is the onlyalternative to the ‘Higher Self’ view.It is only this fourth and final point which gives any credence to the‘objective’ side of the debate, and is therefore the only point we need toconsider further. We will do so within the context of examining whatCrowley said on the ‘subjective’ side of the debate, but before we do thatwe must address one additional matter related to the ‘objective’ side.The Aiwass ProblemAs well as making various sometimes confusing and apparently contra-dictory remarks about the Holy Guardian Angel in an ‘objective’ and‘subjective’ sense, there is one additional and wholly separate sense inwhich Crowley talked about the ‘Holy Guardian Angel’.InThe Equinox of the Gods, Crowley wrote that:I lay claim to be the sole authority competent to decide dis-puted points with regard to the Book of the Law, seeing thatits Author, Aiwaz, is none other than mine own Holy GuardianAngel, to Whose Knowledge and Conversation I have attained,so that I have exclusive access to Him.and earlier, in his ‘new comment’ to AL III, 68:And is not this Book the Word of Aiwaz, and is not He mineHoly Guardian Angel[?]"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21We saw in the previous section that comments Crowley made whichare often used to support an ‘objective’ view of the Holy Guardian Angeldo not, in fact, contradict the ‘subjective’ view at all. But the idea ofAiwaz being Crowley’s Holy Guardian Angel, if we entertain it seriously,creates a whole slew of contradictions.Firstly, we can remark that inOne Star in SightCrowley said that:It is impossible to lay down precise rules by which a manmay attain to the knowledge and conversation of His HolyGuardian Angel; for that is the particular secret of each oneof us; a secret not to be told or even divined by any other,whatever his grade. It is the Holy of Holies, whereof eachman is his own High Priest, and none knoweth the Name ofhis brother’s God, or the Rite that invokes Him.yet we know the ‘Name of [Crowley’s] God’ — indeed, we know twoalternative spellings for it — as well as the ‘Rite that invokes Him’, sinceCrowley published it in 1929 asLiber Samekh. This is not, of course, aserious problem — there is no reason why someone should not disclosetheir method for invoking their Holy Guardian Angel nor any names theychoose to give to it.More serious is what — if we accept that Aiwaz was Crowley’s HolyGuardian Angel and that he achieved Knowledge and Conversation of himas he claims, inThe Equinox of the Godsamongst other places, to havedone in October, 1906 after ‘six months of Invocation’ — we are to makeof the 1904 ‘reception’ legend ofThe Book of the Law. One would thinkthat audible dictation — if we are to believe Crowley’s story — wouldqualify as ‘Knowledge and Conversation’,32yet it occurred more than twoand a half years before the KCHGA that Crowley actually described inThe Equinox of the Godsitself.Moreover, despite Crowley’s categorisation inMagick in Theory andPracticethat one is ‘conscious of his own consecrated course, and con-fidently ready to run it’ once one has attained to the Knowledge andConversation of one’s Holy Guardian Angel, in Crowley’s own words herejected the message of Aiwass until he found the ‘missing’ manuscript ofThe Book of the Lawin Boleskine House, in June of 1909.33In a letterdated April 25, 1938, Crowley wrote that ‘I fought against [the] forces [be-hindThe Book of the Law] with the whole of my power for many years’,and inMagick Without Tearswrote that: ‘You disagree with Aiwass —32Although John Symonds draws a distinction between ‘conversation’ and ‘dictation’in his introduction toThe Confessions. Even so, Crowley claimed to have put questionsto Aiwass and to have received answers. InThe Book of Thoth, for instance, heclaimed that ‘when he was writing down theBook of the Lawfrom the dictation ofthe messenger of the Secret Chiefs, he seems to have put a mental question, suggestedby the words in Chapter I, verse 57. . . there came an interpolated answer’.33SeeThe Confessions of Aleister Crowley, Chapter 65."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22so do all of us’. If we accept the notion that Aiwass was Crowley’s HolyGuardian Angel, then whether we place his Knowledge and Conversationwith Aiwass in 1904 or 1906, the fact that he rejected Aiwass’s message,fought against that message ‘with the whole of [his] power for many years’and still, even in 1945, ‘disagree[d] with Aiwass’, then the type of ‘HolyGuardian Angel’ that Aiwass is appears very, very different from the typeof Holy Guardian Angel that Crowley consistently talked about through-out the rest of his corpus, regardless of whether the latter is ‘subjective’or ‘objective’.A further problem arising from Crowley’s statement that ‘none knoweththe Name of his brother’s God, or the Rite that invokes Him’ is the factthat he consistently required the assistance of others to ‘invoke’ Aiwass.The 1904 ‘reception’ began with Rose, not Aleister, Crowley receiving a‘communication’ from Aiwass,34and in April, 1906 he ‘decided to ask F.35to invoke Aiwass and converse with Him when invoked, and thereby todecide on the quality of that Magick’36which she then did, with ‘Aiwass’apparently appearing. If the Holy Guardian Angel is the embodiment ofthe ‘Great Work’ and the ‘True Will’ that Crowley consistently describedit as then it strains one’s credulity to suppose thatsomeone elsecouldinvoke one’s ‘Angel’.In addition, inMagick Without TearsCrowley wrote of the way inwhich the ‘Masters’ — whom we may reasonably identify with ‘the forcesbehind the Book’ — contacted him:the effort on my part was precisely nil, I resented Their inter-ference with proud bitter angry disbelief. . . They chose meThis is entirely consistent with Crowley’s assertion that he ‘fought againstthose forces with the whole of [his] power’, and makes clear the fact thathis dealings with those forces — of whom Aiwass was at least their rep-resentative, if not one of them himself — wasnotthe result of anythingthat Crowley did, but the result of something that was donetohim. Thisalso makes no sense at all in the context of the Knowledge and Conversa-tion of the Holy Guardian Angel being equivalent to achieving the ‘GreatWork’, with the idea that KCHGA exists within the context of a systemof personal development. If Aiwass is Crowley’s ‘Holy Guardian Angel’,and his communications with Aiwass are reflective of his ‘Knowledge andConversation’ with Aiwass, then once again he was a very different kindof ‘Holy Guardian Angel’ than the kind to which the entire developmentprogram of the A∴A∴was directed, ‘objective’ or otherwise.34In Chapter 6 ofThe Equinox of the Gods, Crowley asks: ‘who, it may be asked,was Aiwass? It is the name given by W. to P. as that of her informant’, ‘W.’ beingRose Crowley and ‘P.’ being Aleister.35i.e. Elaine Simpson36The Confessions of Aleister Crowley, chapter 58."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23Further, the contexts in which the Aiwass assertions appear are them-selves rather strange and contradictory. As we have already seen,37TheEquinox of the Godsitself defines the Holy Guardian Angel as ‘our SecretSelf — our Subconscious Ego’, but then says that:they38are not My words, unless Aiwaz be taken to be no morethan my subconscious self, or some part of it: in that case,my conscious self being ignorant of the Truth in the Bookand hostile to most of the ethics and philosophy of the Book,Aiwaz is a severely suppressed part of me. Such a theorywould further imply that I am, unknown to myself, possessedof all sorts of præternatural knowledge and power. The law ofParsimony of Thought (Sir W. Hamilton) appears in rebuttal.appearing to flatly refute such a suggestion. In a single chapter, Crowleysimultaneously claims that the Holy Guardian Angel is ‘our Secret Self— our Subconscious Ego’, that ‘Aiwaz is none other than [his] own HolyGuardian Angel’, and that Aiwaz should apparently not ‘be taken to beno more than [his] subconscious self’. The fact that all three of thesestatements — which appear in quick succession to each other — cannotsimultaneously be true should lead us very strongly to suspect that whenCrowley labeled Aiwass as his ‘Holy Guardian Angel’, he wasn’t usingthat term in the same sense that he usually was, and was generatingconfusion by using the same label to refer to two very different things.Further still,The Equinox of the Godsalso contains the followingstatement from Crowley:I now incline to believe that Aiwass is not only the God or De-mon or Devil once held holy in Sumer, and mine own GuardianAngel, but also a man as I amand in the previous chapter he says that:whether Aiwass is a spiritual being, or a man known to Fra.P., is a matter of the merest conjecture.The idea of the Holy Guardian Angel being a ‘præternatural being’ isdifficult enough, but the suggestion that one’s Holy Guardian Angel canactually be another human being walking the planet — as Crowley ap-pears to assert that he is in the first quotation above, and appears tohave no problems accepting in the second — pushes the definition pastbreaking point.Crowley’s identification of Aiwass as his Holy Guardian Angel is ananomaly, therefore. It may be that he was merely seeking to bolster his37On page 6.38i.e. the words ofThe Book of the Law."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24own position as a religious and world leader by creating a very personallink with the ‘præternatural author’ ofThe Book of the Lawso that hecould then claim — as he did — to ‘have exclusive access to Him’,39andtherefore ‘to be the sole authority competent to decide disputed pointswith regard to the Book of the Law’. Whether this is the case or not, it isat least beyond reasonable doubt that when Crowleydidrefer to Aiwassas his ‘Holy Guardian Angel’, he wasnotusing that term in the samesense as he consistently used it elsewhere in his works, because to do sowould completely overturn and abrogate his entire philosophy and systemof magical development, and the fact that he continued to promote thisphilosophy and system right the way through toMagick Without Tearsdemonstrates that he did not, in fact, consider it so abrogated. Thisbeing the case, the ‘Aiwass problem’ need trouble us no further, and wecan continue with our investigation.The Subjective HGAWe have previously looked at the question of whether the Holy GuardianAngel is or must be an ‘external individual’ — i.e. an honest-to-goodnessexternal angel — or an ‘internal individual’ — i.e. a kind of ‘projectionof the personality’ — and most discussions on the subject revolve aroundthis question. It is, however, arguably far more interesting to look moreclosely at the idea that the HGA is any kind of individual at all.The most simplistic interpretation of the concept of the ‘Knowledgeand Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel’ is that of an individual ofsome kind — either external or internal — that one goes to for ‘advice’,that one asks questions of, and that one obtains guidance from. Crowleyhimself said inMagick Without Tears:Imagine for a moment that you are an orphan in the chargeof a guardian, inconceivably learned from your point of view.Suppose therefore that you are puzzled by some problem suit-able to your childish nature, your obvious and most simpleway is to approach your guardian and ask him to enlightenyou. It is clearly part of his function as guardian to do hisbest to help you. Very good, that is the first method, and aclose parallel with what we understand by the word Magick.4039Although he clearly did not, since as we have seen Rose Crowley was apparentlyable to receive communications from him and Elaine Simpson was able to directlyinvoke him herself.40As is often the case, it is enlightening to consider the context in which this commentwas made. His correspondent asked ‘why [should I] devote so much of my valuabletime to subjects like Magick and Yoga?’ to which he replied: ‘[Your time] certainly isnot valuable unless the universe has a meaning, and what is more, unless you knowwhat that meaning is — at least roughly — it is millions to one that you will find"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25Crowley famously said inMagick Without Tearsthat:My observation of the Universe convinces me that there arebeings of intelligence and power of a far higher quality thananything we can conceive of as human; that they are not nec-essarily based on the cerebral and nervous structures that weknow; and that the one and only chance for mankind to ad-vance as a whole is for individuals to make contact with suchBeings.and this was primarily responsible for kicking off the bizarre ‘extraterres-trial’ offshoot of ‘Thelema’. Those in the ‘objective’ camp tend to sub-scribe to the view that the HGA is just such an entity, despite the factthat this particular quote specifically talks about the chance for mankindto advance as a whole, rather than about any form of personal progress.41But, for the sake of argument, let’s assume for a moment that suchbeings do exist, and that we have contacted one that we believe to be our‘Holy Guardian Angel’, so we ask it questions in some way — whetherverbalised or not — to obtain a form of guidance. If we are to accept onface value that the guidance we receive is guidance we should follow, weare making two implicit assumptions:1. The entity knows what is ‘best for us’; and2. The entity wants to communicate that to us.These are not assumptions we should make without grave consideration.It is entirely possible that the entity in question may be mischievous, orpositively malevolent. The fact that he is a ‘higher being’ cannot be reliedupon to infer his good intentions. Humans, for instance, may reasonablybe assumed42to be a ‘higher form of beings’ than cows. Yet if cowsyourself barking up the wrong tree. First of all let us consider this question of themeaning of the universe. It is its own evidence to design, and that design intelligentdesign. . . there can be no possible doubt about the existence of some kind of intelli-gence, and that kind is far superior to anything of which we know as human.’ Crowley’sinvocation of the argument from design is curious. As far as the evolution of life isconcerned, Darwin and his successors — such as Richard Dawkins inClimbing MountImprobable— have destroyed the argument by revealing natural selection as the onlyknown mechanism capable of solving the problem of improbability and explaining theappearanceof design; the postulation of an intelligent designer in fact only compoundsthat problem of improbability. Modern theories of cosmological inflation suggest thatthe observed structure and order in the universe arose from quantum fluctuations inthe inflationary region ‘seeding’ the formation of discrete structures, which also speaksagainst the concept of a designer. If — as this extract appears to suggest — Crowley’sbelief in ‘præternatural intelligences’ relies heavily on the argument from design, thenit is a belief we should treat with a high degree of skepticism.41And, in fact, Crowley never links ‘such Beings’ with the same ‘order’ of Beings towhich he asserts the Holy Guardian Angel belongs in the ‘objective individual’ extract,but many Thelemites groundlessly make this connection anyway.42By other humans, at least."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26ever managed to make a conscious link with humanity, just imagine the‘wisdom’ they’d receive: ‘We’re going to fatten you up, then kill you andeat your flesh. Then we’re going to stick your children in little cratesand do the same to them, too. Oh, and then we’re going to make reallynice coats and shoes out of your skin. Have a good eternity!’ It’s quitepossible that if these beings are so far advanced compared to us, then weare so low compared to them that they may not even notice us, let alonecare about our wellbeing.In any case, we are faced with the problem that we cannot accept theguidance from such an individual to bea prioriworth following. Thisproblem is not diminished by taking the ‘internal individual’ approach.Let’s assume that, instead, the HGA is a ‘projection of the personality’as some claim,43and repeat the process by going to it for guidance. Itis well known that the personality contains many conflicting and self-destructive elements. If it were not so, then the part of the personalitywe are thinking with wouldn’t need the guidance of another part. Thisthen raises a similar question: how do we know the part of the personalitywe are speaking to is worth listening to? What if we are speaking to the‘projection’ of a neurosis, or a conflict?Under either approach, therefore, we are left with the problem of howto determine whether or not the guidance we receive is guidance we shouldbe following, how to determine whether the ‘individual’ — whether inter-nal or external — is an individual worth listening to.This leaves us in a sticky bind. There are only two possible approaches.One is to simply havefaiththat the messages are genuine. This, for ob-vious reasons, is not a sensible approach. The other is toassessthe‘genuineness’ of the messages in some way. This raises an obvious ques-tion: if we are independently capable of assessing the genuineness of themessages from the ‘angel’, then why do we need to contact the ‘angel’at all? If we already possess such a discriminatory faculty, why shouldsuch ‘Knowledge and Conversation’ be required, or even useful? If yougo to your ‘angel’ for guidance, and filter the messages through your owndiscriminatory faculty, then you aren’t ‘listening to your angel’ at all —you’re picking and choosing the messages that best agree with what youalready think.44Not only does this make ‘Knowledge and Conversationof the Holy Guardian Angel’ a nonsensical concept, but it makes it a non-existent one; an individual following this approach is simply engaged inno such thing.The theory of the HGA as a separate individual — either an ‘objective’or a ‘subjective’ one — that one individual is able to consciously conversewith appears to be fundamentally self-contradictory and flawed, and even43And which Crowley denounces as ‘a damnable heresy and a dangerous delusion’as we have already seen.44Compare this to our comments in relation to the ‘Higher Self’ on page 11."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27when successful appears unable to do what it claims to.There is a way to make this approach work, however, if we shift per-spective slightly. We can say that the HGAisan individual, in the fullsense of the word, if we define the HGA — as Crowley in fact did —as theself. This definition would require that we consider the consciousmind, the thoughts, the emotions, the self-image, everything we usuallyrefer to as ‘ourselves’, tonot comprise a self at all. With this perspective,the HGA is not the ‘Higher Self’; it is theonlyself. ‘Knowledge and Con-versation of the Holy Guardian Angel’ would therefore consist not of oneindividual communicating with another individual, but of one ‘individual’realising that it’s not an individual at all, and throwing its own ‘interests’out of the window. In this case there is no need to ‘assess the genuineness’of the guidance from the ‘angel’, because there is no longer any conflictingguidance arising from the consciousness, no longer any ‘self-interest’ thatthe ‘guidance’ needs to further.And, in fact, when we look at how Crowley actuallydescribedKCHGA,this is exactly what we see. InLiber Samekh— ‘being the Ritual employedby the Beast 666 for the Attainment of the Knowledge and Conversationof his Holy Guardian Angel’ — Crowley writes that:the Adept will be free to concentrate his deepest self, thatpart of him which unconsciously orders his true Will, uponthe realization of his Holy Guardian Angel. The absence ofhis bodily, mental and astral consciousness is indeed cardinalto success, for it is their usurpation of his attention which hasmade him deaf to his Soul, and his preoccupation with theiraffairs that has prevented him from perceiving that Souland continues:If the Adept is to be any wise conscious of his Angel it mustbe that some part of his mind is prepared to realise the rap-ture, and to express it to itself in one way or another. Thisinvolves the perfection of that part, its freedom from preju-dice and the limitations of rationality so-called. For instance:one could not receive the illumination as to the nature of lifewhich the doctrine of evolution should shed, if one is passion-ately persuaded that humanity is essentially not animal, orconvinced that causality is repugnant to reason. The Adeptmust be ready for the utter destruction of his point of viewon any subject, and even that of his innate conception of theforms and laws of thought.Thus, the individual’s conscious mind must achieve ‘freedom fromprejudice and the limitations of rationality so-called’ in order that itsown activities do not influence or restrict the actions of the self, in order"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28that its own ‘preferences’ do not pull the self in any one direction oranother from whither it would naturally tend to go. It must achievesilence in its own meanderings if it is to perceive accurately the natureof the self, and to become consciously aware of the will. It is indeedthe ‘usurpation of his attention which has made him deaf to his Soul,and his preoccupation with their affairs that has prevented him fromperceiving that Soul.’ The ‘Conversation’ with the Angel comes when theaspirant has become sufficiently practiced in seeing past the contents of hisown mind that he can perceive his ‘True Self’ within, his Holy GuardianAngel, and the source of his ‘True Will’. It is this ‘True Self’ which is‘independent’ of the mind and ‘external’ to it, and it is by appealing tothis ‘True Self’ that we obtain the benefits of communicating with an‘independent intelligence’ as opposed to the mere contents and distortedreflections of our own conscious minds.This idea runs through substantiallyallof Crowley’s published tech-nical prose, even in his final work,Magick Without Tears, echoing hisstatement fromMagick in Theory and Practiceover twenty years ear-lier45which we have already quoted:46We may readily concur that the Augœides, the ‘Genius’ ofSocrates, and the ‘Holy Guardian Angel’ of Abramelin theMage, are identical.and later in that same work, when talking of:Initiation, which implies the liberation and development of thegenius latent in us all (is not one of the names of the ‘HolyGuardian Angel’ the Genius?)‘Augœides’ is an obscure term. Thomas Taylor, the English Neoplatonist,wrote, when commenting on the Greek philosopher Porphyry, that:a long period, when the revolving orb of time has perfected itscirculation, frees the soul from its concrete stains, and leavesthe ethereal sense pure, together with the fire (or splendour)of simple ether. For here he evidently conjoins the rationalsoul, or the ethereal sense, with its splendid vehicle, or thefire of simple ether; since it is well known that this vehicle, ac-cording to Plato, is rendered by proper purgation ‘augœides’,or luciform, and divine.describing the term in relation to a purification or liberation of the ‘soul’,just as Crowley talked of ‘the liberation and development of the genius45And also echoing his letter inThe Temple of Solomon the King, almost fortyyears earlier: ‘Abramelin calls him Holy Guardian Angel. . .

The ‘“Genius” of Socrates’ has been discussed by Frenchphilosopher Sarah Kofman:if we are to understand that nature of the Socratic ‘genius’appropriately, without mistaking it, as some do, for a sortof guardian angel, the anthropological analogy must be re-tained. . . we recognize that Socrates’ genius is nothing otherthan his personal oracle; it functions as an internal replace-ment for the earlier decision-making agency, the external ora-cle.47making a very explicit link with the idea of the Holy Guardian Angelas a kind of ‘internal’ advisor rather than an actual, honest-to-goodness‘guardian angel’ which Crowley describes as ‘patently absurd’. Thus,even in his last work — which, as we have seen, is the work primarilyresponsible for starting the whole ‘objective’ side of the debate — Crowleycontinues to describe the Holy Guardian Angel in terms of ‘liberating’something already latent within us — i.e. unleashing the ‘True Self’ fromthe veils of the mind which surround it — as opposed to ‘contacting’ anexternal being.In the ‘new comment’ to AL I, 8–9, Crowley writes that:We are not to regard ourselves as base beings, without whosesphere is Light or ‘God’. Our minds and bodies are veils of theLight within. The uninitiate is a ‘dark star,’ and the GreatWork for him is to make his veils transparent by ‘purifying’them. This ‘purification’ is really ‘simplification’; it is notthat the veil is dirty, but that the complexity of its folds makeit opaque. The Great Work therefore consists principally inthe solution of complexes. Everything in itself is perfect, butwhen things are muddled they become ‘evil’. The Doctrine isevidently of supreme importance, from its position as the first‘revelation’ of Aiwass. . .We are to pay attention to this Inmost Light. . . It is the‘veils’ mentioned previously in this comment that obstruct therelation between Nuit and Hadit.We are not to worship the Khu, to fall in love with ourMagical Image. To do this — we have all done it — is toforget our Truth. If we adore Form, it becomes opaque toBeing, and may soon prove false to itself. The Khu in each ofus includes the Cosmos as he knows it. To me, even anotherKhabs is only part of my Khu. Our own Khabs is our one soleTruth.47Socrates: fictions of a philosopher."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30Crowley rightly labels this doctrine as being ‘of supreme importance’,since it is the fundamental idea underlying the Thelemic approach to self-development. The ‘Light within’ of the Khabs — the ‘True Self’ or ‘SecretSelf’ of which Crowley so often spoke, and which he identified with the‘Genius’, and ‘Augœiedes’ and the ‘Holy Guardian Angel’ — is ‘veiled’by the ‘folds’ of the Khu, by ‘our minds and bodies’, and the essence ofpersonal attainment — the essence of attaining to the Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel — is to ‘make [one’s] veilstransparent’, to clear through the ‘muddle’ of the mind.This is the language used inLiber Samekhwhich we have alreadyseen: ‘The absence of his bodily, mental and astral consciousness is in-deed cardinal to success, for it is their usurpation of his attention whichhas made him deaf to his Soul, and his preoccupation with their affairsthat has prevented him from perceiving that Soul’. Of the mechanismunderlying theLiber Samekhritual itself, he states in the rubric to thatritual that ‘the effect of the Ritual has been (a) to keep them48so busywith their own work that they cease to distract him; (b) to separate themso completely that his soul is stripped of its sheaths’.The notion of a ‘Silent Self’ — or ‘Soul’, or ‘Genius’ — being sur-rounded by veils of ‘complexes’ also appears in Crowley’sConfessions,where he explains to J.W.N. Sullivan that:You, being a man, are therefore a star. The soul of a star iswhat we call genius. You are a genius. This fact is obscuredby moral complexes which enmesh it, or lack of adequate ma-chinery to express it in terms of action.The idea comes up as early asBook 4in 1911, where Crowley writes:The main idea is that the Infinite, the Absolute, God,49theOver-soul, or whatever you may prefer to call it,50is alwayspresent; but veiled or masked by the thoughts of the mind,just as one cannot hear a heart-beat in a noisy city. . . to obtainknowledge of That, it is only necessary to still all thoughts.This extract again speaks to the doctrine of the Khabs being ‘veiled ormasked by. . . the mind’, and the solution being to ‘still all thoughts’ inorder to ‘make [one’s] veils transparent by “purifying” them’, much asthe dirt in a disturbed pool will settle to the bottom and leave the waterclear, if only the water is stilled for long enough to allow that to happen.48i.e. ‘his bodily, mental and astral consciousness’.49See page 6 for an example of Crowley using ‘God’ to refer to the ‘Next Step’, andidentifying it with the ‘Holy Guardian Angel’, and page 5 for an example of him usingthe word ‘Adonai’ — which means the same thing — in the same way.50Per the preceding footnote, we may add ‘Genius’, ‘Augœiedes’ and ‘Holy GuardianAngel’ to this list."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31The idea is repeated in solar terms inDe Lege Libellum, published in thethird volume ofThe Equinoxin 1919:Behold! the Kingdom of God is within you, even as the Sunstandeth eternal in the heavens, equal at midnight and atnoon. He riseth not: he setteth not: it is but the shadow ofthe earth which concealeth him, or the clouds upon her face.51Indeed, the idea is presented even earlier, in one of the Thelemic ‘HolyBooks’ themselves, namelyLiber Cordis Cincti Serpente— an ‘accountof the relations of the Aspirant with his Holy Guardian Angel’ — whichwas written in 1907. LXV II, 59–60 says:But I have called unto Thee, and I have journeyed unto Thee,and it availed me not. I waited patiently, and Thou wast withme from the beginning.while LXV III, 29 continues:Yet all the while Thou was hidden therein, as the Lord ofSilence is hidden in the buds of the lotus.and LXV IV, 39 repeats:Before I saw Thee Thou wast already with me.Throughout the book, the theme of the Holy Guardian Angel — its pri-mary subject — as being something which exists within the individual,and which must only be attended to for communion to occur is repeat-edly found: ‘Many things I beheld mediate and immediate; but, beholdingthem no more, I beheld Thee.’52This last quotation echoes the statementfromLiber Samekhthat ‘the absence of his bodily, mental and astralconsciousness is indeed cardinal to success, for it is their usurpation ofhis attention which has made him deaf to his Soul, and his preoccupa-tion with their affairs that has prevented him from perceiving that Soul’.Liber Cordis Cincti Serpentesays ‘Many things I beheld mediate and im-mediate’, corresponding to the ‘usurpation’ of the aspirant’s attention ofhis ‘bodily, mental and astral consciousness’. Once the aspirant succeedsin attaining to the ‘absence’ of that consciousness — i.e. when he ‘be-hold[s] them no more’ — then the Knowledge and Conversation of hisAngel ensues: ‘I beheld Thee.’ The aspirant’s Angel was ‘with [him] fromthe beginning’, and ‘journey[ing]’ to the Angel — i.e. pursuing a pathof external attainment, seeking ‘God’ outside of one’s own consciousness,‘worship[ing] the Khu’ and ‘fall[ing] in love with [his] Magical Image’ —51This connection with the Sun is expanded on by C.S. Jones in his essaySteppingout of the Old Æon into the New, also published in the ‘Blue Equinox’.52LXV III, 32"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32‘availed [him] not’. The Khabs — the ‘Holy Guardian Angel’ — is ‘hiddentherein’, and he must simply bring about the silence of his ‘bodily, mentaland astral consciousness’ in order to enter into communion with it.Crowley also talks to this idea in his ‘new comment’ to AL III, 60–62(emphasis added):Thus he will assimilate the Law,53and make it the norm ofhis conscious being; this by itself will suffice to initiate him,to dissolve his complexes, to unveil himself to himself;and so shall he attain the Knowledge and Conversation of hisHoly Guardian Angel. . .We have seen that Ra-Hoor-Khuit is in one sense the SilentSelf in a man, a Name of his Khabs, not so impersonal asHadit, but the first and least untrue formulation of the Ego.We are to reverse this self in us, then, not to suppress it andsubordinate it. Nor are we to evade it, but to come to it.Again we see the idea of the ‘unveil[ing]’ of the Khabs — the ‘SilentSelf’ — through the dissolution of ‘complexes’ that Crowley describedearlier in his ‘new comment’. By ‘com[ing] to. . . this self in us’ — by‘Worship[ing]. . . the Khabs’54— and making transparent the veils aroundit, we ‘attain the Knowledge and Conversation of [our] Holy GuardianAngel’.InLittle Essays Toward Truth,55Crowley writes that (emphasis added):Here the great obstacles are these; firstly, the misunderstand-ing of Self; and secondly, the resistance of the rational mindagainst its own conclusions. Men must cast off these two re-strictions;they must begin to realise that Self is hiddenbehind, and independent of, the mental and materialinstrument in which they apprehend their Point-of-View56and inMagick Without Tearsthat:As you travel inward, you become able to perceive all thelayers which surround the ‘Self’ from within5753The fact that this commentary is on AL III, 60, ‘There is no law beyond Do whatthou wilt’, provides further evidence of Crowley’s identification of the Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel with the revelation of the ‘True Will’.54AL I, 955Published in 1938.56Or, as the chapter ‘Steeped Horsehair’ inThe Book of Liesputs it, ‘mind, neverat ease, creaketh “I”. . . man [is] only himself when lost to himself in The Charioting.’57Again demonstrating that Crowley had not, even inMagick Without Tears, aban-doned this same idea of attaining to self-knowledge by perceiving through the ‘veils’of the mind that he had been consistently expressing over the preceding forty years,notwithstanding the ‘objective individual’ comments in another letter."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33Finally, Crowley recounts an incident in hisConfessionsinvolvingFrank Bennett:One afternoon we went off bathing with the Ape.58I prattledas we walked quite pointlessly and just as we reached the edgeof the cliff above the bay I made some casual remark whichproved a winning shot. He stopped short and gasped; his eyesstarting from his head. . . I was mildly surprised to see himdash down the path like a young goat, tear off his clothes,and sprint into the sea like an alarmed seal. He never spokea word till after the swim and the return to the the road. Hethen said with a pale face and in awed accents, ‘Please tellme again what you said just now?’. . . He asked me to discussthe subject more fully, which I did, after which he relapsedinto silence. Directly he reached the abbey,59he passed into astate of trance which lasted three whole days without a break.He then came to me looking like an incarnation of pure joyand told me what had happened. . . One minute facet of truthunveiled from the matrix by the wheel of my word had let inthe light. In three days he had achieved the critical initiationwhich had baffled him for nearly thirty years.As John Symonds and Kenneth Grant explain in the footnotes to theiredition ofThe Confessions:We know from Frank Bennett’s diary what Crowley said tohim on this occasion. ‘Progradior,60I want to explain to youfully, and in a few words, what initiation means, and whatis meant when we talk of the Real Self,61and what the RealSelf is.’ And there and then Crowley told him that it wasall a matter of getting the subconscious mind to work; andwhen this subconscious mind was allowed full sway, withoutinterference from the conscious mind, then illumination couldbe said to have begun; for the subconscious mind was ourHoly Guardian Angel. Crowley illustrated the point thus: ev-erything is experienced in the subconscious mind, and it (thesubconscious) is constantly urging its will62on consciousness,and when the inner desires are restricted or suppressed, evilof all kinds is the result.58i.e. the ‘Ape of Thoth’, Leah Hirsig.59i.e. the ‘Abbey of Thelema’ in Cefal`u, Sicily.60‘Progradior’, roughly translating to ‘I advance’, was Frank Bennett’s ‘magicalmotto’ in the A∴A∴61i.e. the ‘True Self’, or the ‘Silent Self’.62Here Crowley is identifying the ‘True Will’ with the will of the ‘subconscious mind’,with the will of the ‘Holy Guardian Angel’."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34Here, in clear and straightforward psychological terms, Crowley identifiesthe ‘Holy Guardian Angel’ with the ‘subconscious’, the ‘True Self’, andthe ‘Khabs’, and states that ‘initiation’ is nothing other than the pro-cess of clearing away the ‘restriction’ and ‘suppression’ of the ‘consciousmind’ which interferes with the expression of the ‘inner desires’, or the‘True Will’. The method is to ‘allow’ the self to have ‘full sway, withoutinterference from the conscious mind.’ As he said inLiber Aleph:Give Ear, give Ear attentively; the Will is not lost; thoughit be buried beneath a life-old midden of Repressions, for itpersisteth vital within thee (is it not the true Motion of thineinmost Being?)and inLittle Essays Toward Truth:We must learn to live without the murderous consciousnessthat every breath we draw swells the sails which bear our frailvessels to the Port of the Grave. . . This state is, in fact, anecessary condition of any proper contemplation of what weare accustomed to consider the first task of the Aspirant, thesolution of the question, ‘What is my True Will?’ For until webecome innocent, we are certain to try to judge our Will bysome Canon of what seems ‘right’ or ‘wrong’; in other words,we are apt to criticise our Will from the outside, whereas TrueWill should spring, a fountain of Light, from within,63andflow unchecked, seething with Love, into the Ocean of Life.This is the true idea of Silence;64it is our Will which issues,perfectly elastic, sublimely Protean, to fill every interstice ofthe Universe of Manifestation which it meets in its course.Thus, we can see that Crowley’s presentation of this idea of the ‘HolyGuardian Angel’ is remarkably consistent, fromLiber Cordis Cincti Ser-pentein 1907, throughBook 4in 1911, throughLiber Aleph, his ‘new com-ment’ andThe Confessionsaround the beginning of the 1920s, throughMagick in Theory and Practiceat the end of the 1920s,65throughLittleEssays Toward Truthtowards the end of the 1930s, all the way toMagickWithout Tearsshortly before the end of his life. Moreover, this concept isinextricably woven into — in fact, defined in terms of — the revelation ofthe ‘True Will’ which is the single most fundamental aspect of practicalThelema and the central concept ofThe Book of the Lawwhose pro-mulgation Crowley made his life. If we accept that the attainment of the63Since it is ‘the true Motion of thine inmost Being’ and ‘but the dynamic aspect ofthe self’.64i.e. the ‘absence of his bodily, mental and astral consciousness’ described inLiberSamekh.65That is,Magick in Theory and Practicewas published in 1929. Much of it waswritten considerably earlier."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"35‘Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel’ is the primaryconcern of Crowley’s system of magical training and self-development,and we accept that that system takes place within the wider context ofThelema, then we are compelled to also accept that this notion, as wehave described above, is what Crowley truly meant when he talked aboutthe HGA. To suppose that it means something else — whether communi-cation with extra-terrestrial aliens, or with ‘projections of the personality’— is unavoidably to make a mockery both of Crowley’s system of trainingand of Thelema itself, since the three concepts go hand-in-hand.SummaryAfter conducting a thorough and comprehensive review of Crowley’s writ-ings on the subject of the Holy Guardian Angel, a number of inescapableconclusions emerge. Most fundamentally, as we have seen, Crowley iden-tified the attainment of the ‘Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel’ with the ‘Great Work’ and with the revelation of the‘True Will’. Since Crowley consistently talked about the ‘True Will’ interms of the ‘inner desires’ of the self which is veiled behind the distortinginfluences of the conscious mind, then we are clearly led to the realisationthat the ‘Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel’ isnothing other than the making transparent of these veils, and that the‘Holy Guardian Angel’ is, in fact, the individual’s ‘True Self’.The comments used to advance a view that Crowley really meant anhonest-to-goodness ‘external Being’ when he used the term are seen to nothold water. His admonition against the term ‘Higher Self’ merely refersto the dangers of worshiping those veils themselves, instead of getting tothe ‘Real Self’ behind them, and his usage of the term ‘objective indi-vidual’ is revealed by the very letter in which that term appears to notrefer to ‘external Beings’ at all. Other than the anomalous ‘Aiwass prob-lem’ which we can justifiably put aside, the only such comments reallyrequiring explanation are those which deal with the idea of ‘independentintelligence’, and when we realise that the thing that intelligence needsto be independentfromis our own conscious mind, then the identifica-tion of the Holy Guardian Angel with the ‘True Self’ — an identificationCrowley repeatedly made throughout the whole of his published works— becomes incontrovertible. That Crowley believed in the existence of‘præternatural beings’ and that he considered making contact with themto be ‘the one and only chance for mankind to advance as a whole’ seemsbeyond reasonable dispute, but this belief of Crowley’s is something thatexists wholly apart from the system of personal attainment and devel-opment that he presented — i.e. to enableindividualsto ‘advance’ —and wholly apart from his usage of the term ‘Holy Guardian Angel’ torefer to the object of that system, and should not be confused with them."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36The ‘Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel’, and thediscovery of the ‘True Will’, are entirely equivalent, and all Crowley’swritings on the subject of the Holy Guardian Angel can only be renderedcomprehensible in this context."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Bibliography[1] Block, J.
