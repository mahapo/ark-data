From his early youth he had a deep interest in the occultand spiritual patterns of the world. In his early twenties he chanced tomeet the infamous Aleister Crowley, Whose hyperbole stirred andoutraged Fleet Street in the twenties and thirties.Crowley's advice to the young seeker was simple - go to the Eastto learn more of the occult and wisdom patterns which had flourishedthere from pre-Christian times. However, the Spanish Civil War - inwhich Dadaji fought against the Fascists as a member of the Interna-tional Brigade - and the second world War intervened.It was 1949 before Dadaji left the shores of Britain to arrive,penniless, in Bombay. There he was introduced by a mutual acquain-tance to a sadhu of the Adinath cult. The Naths were at one time verynumerous and influential in India; there are nine subsects, one of whichis the Adinath cult. 'Nath', is Sanskrit for 'Lord' and is an epithet ofShiva, the Lord of Yoga. Initiates have names ending in 'nath'.One of the Nath initiates - Goraknath - devised or reintroducedHatha Yoga in the 1lth Century. The Nath cult was also responsible forsuch works as the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and the Shiva and GorakshaSamhitas.The sadhu introduced to Dadaji was the last remaining AdinathYogi in all India, and was also the Adiguru or holder of the sacred lineof tradition. Unlike some of the other sects of Naths the Adinath's chiefinterest was the Yoga of liberation from the restraining conditions of life,and to become free from the Wheel of Samsara or death and rebirth.Dadaji was initiated as a sannyasi by Adiguru Lokanatha, so becomingthe first Englishman to become a sadhu.A sadhu may make only three demands: for shelter - the shade ofa tree; for clothing - rags. For food - leftover scraps. These conditions informer times helped the seeker after wisdom to realise the transitoryand ultimately worthless nature of attachment.In this the sadhus emulate the Guru figure of all India, LordDattatreya. Datta is the legendary founder and guardian spirit of manyif not most of the Nath subsects. He represents a human being who hasswung free of the three gunas or threads of Hindu philosophy fromwhich the whole fabric of the Cosmos is said to be sewn. For this reasonhe is often pictured as a naked man with three heads and six arms torepresent the Hindu Trinity of gods, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Tantra MagickFor the next thirty years Dadaji wandered South East Asia as apenniless sannyasi. His travels took him to Bhutan, where he wasinitiated into the Kargyupta Sect of Tibetan Lamaism. He also travelledto Malaysia where he became a Taoist priest and studied the I Ching,and to Ceylon, where he was for a time a 'Bhikku of Theravada Bud-dhism.It may perhaps seem strange that a sannyasi of a Hindu traditioncould also become a lama, a bhikku and a priest, but as many of theEastern traditions recognize only sincerity in an aspirant for wisdomand knowledge there is no essential contradiction in a person havingmore than one guru or guide or seeking wherever an individual questmay lead.During Dadaji's Indian wanderings, he met and was initiated bythe last surviving Guru of the Uttara Kaulas of Northern Tantriks. Healso became an initiate of the Naked Sahajiya cult of Benares.IntroductionAMOOKOS - The Arcane and MagickalOrder of the Knights of ShambhalaIn this book you will find the first three sets of instructions for the groupAMOOKOS (the Arcane and Magickal Order of the Knights of Shambhala).For the first time, we publicly reveal the methods, rites andphilosophy pursued by an inner group of initiates within the NathaCommunity.This book shows how the esoteric strands of east and west are-fused together into a practical system which had as its purpose theunveiling of the spiritual potential latent in every individual. Initiates ofAMOOKOS take as their starting point the assumption that within eachand every human is a divine spark, the Alpha Ovule, or spirit, whichsimply had to be freed from the bonds or fetters of ignorance orconditioning to shine free.As a presentation of practical methods for working towards self-knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, many may find the exercisesin the different grade papers indispensable. Much of the material willnot be found in any other tradition or teaching. Its rendering of thebasics and essentials of tantrik practice in simple language is also new.AMOOKOS was started at the behest of HH Shri GurudevaMahendranath. Wishing to transmit his own experience and the Nathtransmission, in 1978 Mahendranath passed the parampara or line oftransmission to a youthful 'seeker after truth'. At this point, the AdinathSampradaya was transformed into an international group (See Charterbelow). Soon after, instructions were received to start a nine-gradegroup within the Naths, and AMOOKOS was the result.Dadaji collaborated with the compilers of this material at everystep, and approved their contents:'the morning post arrived and another shake up with the grade rawmaterial. Astounding - will take some days to get through it stepby step.'14 March 1983.'I have been wandering again through AMOOKOS grade 1 and 2material. It is stupendous, nectar of the wise. You have certainlyproduced a miracle explosion in the occult world.' 24 March 1983.\"The grade 3 papers are hyper-dimensional and this alone is amasterpiece of collated wisdom and expression.' 16 November1983."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"more independent nature. Zonule holders have autonomy in the run-ning of their own encampment. AMOOKOS wanted to encourage inde-pendence for people, and so avoid the problems of egotism, factional-ism, and 'grade congestion' — problems which have plagued manyWestern groups.The Inner Temple was for people who wish to pursue their ownspiritual path, and who need no props, guidance or instruction fromothers.Membership is open to any sincere person of 18 years or more.There are no financial obligations. There was an obligation not to com-municate grade material to non-initiates. Members are free to leaveAMOOKOS at any time, and for any reason, or, if they choose, tosuspend their work for resumption at a later date.Many will wish to know the reason why these instructions are nowbeing made more generally available. The major and important reasonis that as the world approaches the millenium, members of the NathaCommunity feel that all should be able to take advantage of the exercisesand wisdom contained in these papers. At the same time, the corrup-tion, back-biting and factionalism of different esoteric groups is ascandal to those who seek a spiritual path. Individual zonule holdersthroughout the world are continuing their work of guidance, experi-mentation and study.The international Nath Community wishes to make available itsmethods and philosophy to all. The time for secret hole-in-the-wallgroups is over.Charter of AMOOKOSBe it known that on this New Year Day, January the First,Nineteen Hundred and Seventy-Eight, this decision, being mytrue Will and Wish has been put into immediate operation.Therefore I, Shri Gurudeva Dadaji Mahendranath, the onlysurviving Supreme Guru of the Adi Natha Sampradaya - the Cultand Organization of the First and Supreme Sacred Lords of theSpiritual Cosmos; King of Shambhala and Grand Lord of itsKnights; Keeper of the First Book of the Nine Secret Chiefs, Merlinof Cockaigne and Light of the Silver Star; do hereby ordain by thatSupreme Authority which rests with me, that the Adi-NathSampradaya shall from henceforth become an International andCosmopolitan Order of all Worthy People, students and house-holders above the age of eighteen years, who may occupy a normallife and pursuit of livelihood; provided always that they accept thethree basic aims and objects of the Nathas - to wit - real Peace, RealFreedom and Real Happiness. Therefore from the Naked Guru toNaked Sishya, the Transmission and Initiation shall begiven to allNoble Masters, Magicians, Alchemists, Masons, Rosicrucians,Astrologers and Occultists of stable nature who will bond them-selves into one Grand Concord of Cosmic People and Work,Experiment and Teach for the weal and welfare of all mankind. Thisnew promulgation does not prevent or discourage those whom asNathas wish to become Hermits, Sannyasins, Anchorites or Re-cluses if they wish to do so. To finalize this decision of a greater andmore expansive Order, the Initiation and Parampara (line of Nathsuccession) has now been passed on by me to Shri LokanathMaharaj, Lord of Cockaigne and Prince of Babalon that He maycontinue the line of succession and pass it on to all other worthypeople. This is our law, the Rhythm of the Cosmos by which theWise must live."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Chapter One: The Apprentice(AMOOKOS Grade Paper 1)IntroductionTo start work in AMOOKOS you will first have to assemble those thingsrequired to work the grade. It will be necessary for you to resolve toactually do the work - our path is a practical one, and the higher realmscannot be introduced all at once.The papers of the first degree are designed to be useful for bothbeginners and people who have had some experience of the esoteric.The work included is designed to give members a foundation for themore demanding work which follows.You should take your time with the grade and not be in too muchof a hurry. Read the chapter through once to familiarise yourself with itscontents. Assemble whatever is necessary.Make daily efforts with perception (page 27) and the Daily Rite(pages 21 to 22).Make weekly experiments in your laboratory Zonule with skrying(page 28). At your leisure, familiarise yourself with the system ofmnemonics, and with the symbolism on page 23 if it is unfamiliar to you.Study and reflect on the rest of your material at your Will.Symbolism of the GradeSymbol:Measuring stick. We can see three aspects to this: the Measure, theMeasurer and the Measured. An object, that which may be measured,may only be known by the measurer (subject) through an instrument ormeasuring-stick. One of our first tasks is to make a valid instrument bywhich the whole Cosmos may be measured.This ruler is divided into 5 sections. More will be learnt of this in theAcademy of the 5 senses, while working the second grade.Colour:Emerald Green. You may use cloth of this colour to sit on whenmeditating in the place of the Dragon-Seat, in the Umbra Zonule.Gem:Green stone, such as an emerald.

Strive to write accurately andfreely, and keep the diary up to date.Its cover and its interior may be adorned with any symbols,patterns of colours that you feel express your aspirations. No-one in theorder will ask to see your diary, although you are free to discuss it withyour co-members if you desire. The size of the book is entirely up to you,although from practical experience we advise it be no smaller than A5,with a hard cover.Umbra ZonuleThe work of members of AMOOKOS takes place in the Umbra Zonule(literally: twilight circle). This is the place where magickal energy israised, directed or absorbed. All individual and group work takes placein this area. Trace a circle about yourself. You may use chalk, or col-colored powders, or the circle mayalso be visualised or traced withthe point of a wand. The centre ofthe zonule is called the Dragon-Seat.You should assemble the fol-lowing in order to represent thefive elements:Aether:The Will of the Magician [a redpentagram]Air:An incense stick is its symbolFire:A brazier, candle, or oil lampWater:Water in a bowlEarth:FoodstuffThese should be placed inthe appropriate quarters as shownin the diagram."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The place of Aether is theDragon-Seat.

However, any time isgood; in this matter there are nofixed and hard rules. We includeon page 21 a ritual which youshould perform each day.InitiationBefore proceeding to work with these papers, it is essential that you areinitiated. If there is no local AMOOKOS group (Zonule) then youshould do this at a time prearranged time with your magickal Guide.In this rite you must be naked. Beforehand you should have hada shower or bath. Do not wear any jewellery on this occasion. You willneed to assemble your equipment to represent the elements and inaddition, you will need ash in order to consecrate your body with themarks of the Tantrik. In order to close the Zonule you will also need acontainer of some sort in which you can light a small fire.OpeningYou should open a Zonule in the following manner: Make a circle of anysuitable size and by any suitable means. Whether within a dwelling orbeneath the sky, you should be naked and apart from the initiation youmay wear ornaments and jewellery if desired.Mark four points around the circumference of the circle to indicatethe major directions. The centre is the Dragon Seat.Also present within the circle should be flame, incense, fruit, waterand a red pentagram. The first four should be placed in the quarters, thelast directly in front of you.Face the east, and dispense with any negative energies by snap-ping the fingers of the right hand or making some other sharp noise -such as the Vajra Mantra PHAT. Do the same in the order East, South,West, North, South-East, South-West, North-West, North-East, Aboveand Below.Facing East, and being seated, say:I salute the line of innumerable NathsAnd cast the Circle of Dragon GlowMay my Zonule be intactAnd the peace of Om Shiva Shakti dwell herein.Clap the hands together, three times, loudly.

See also detailsof further reading, at the end ofthis chapter.The Opening Rite - anintroduction to itssymbolismThe first degree of AMOOKOScan be viewed symbolically asthe first Temple, City, or Gate onour Kaula island of Amookos-Shambhala. We discuss the termShambhala more fully below, onpage 28. In AMOOKOS we seethis land of peace, freedom andhappiness as an internal place, lo-cated within our own bodies.Amookos-Shambhala has nine en-closures in all, each a pleasure-garden of delight.For the new member, the ramparts of this city are guarded on theirfour sides by four celestial yoginis (female yogis), or goddesses, eachmounted on their magical beasts.At the centre of the city-complex of Shambhala is a Meru-Lingam,Merlin or Staff which supports the world. Here is Adinath Shiva withhis Shakti. Adinath is a Sanskrit word which means the PrimordialLord. The Kaula Island itself is in the centre of an ocean of nectar orambrosia.AH this is symbolically resumed in the grade papers by the bodyyantra. A yantra is simply the representation, in the form of a diagram,of a spiritual truth. They frequently offer many interpretations. Forinstance, the body yantra is an emblem both of the body itself, and of thetwo luminaries, sun and moon, and the earth. The Dragon Seat of theUmbra Zonule is the Bindu or centre of the circle. But this is alsoidentical with the meru lingam in the symbolism of the island ofAmookos. You will come to study the Body Yantra in depth whileworking the second grade.The Dragon Lords or Secret Chiefs of Amookos each hold thedouble trident or Vajra 3 which signifies the human body - two arms,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"two legs, head and genitals. Youwill see that this is also the Sunand Moon in one figure, or above-below.4The beasts which guard theramparts of the Island ofAMOOKOS are animal forms ofShiva, and the yoginis or God-desses are forms of Shakti, or theGoddess Kalika, who is the Ladyof Time.You can represent these inthe UZ as crystal, ruby, sapphireand emerald lingas or penises setin golden yonis or vaginas. Ifrepresented in this way, a redtrident should be marked on thelingam.More esoterically, the fourforms represent the angles orcorners of an Amookos time-breath chart, or breath-cycle,known vulgarly as a horoscope. East is the Ascendent, South is theMidheaven, West is the Descendant, and North is the Lower Heaven.These four together make one day of Shambhala.Such a day is not reckoned in hours but in minutes and equals 24hours x 60 minutes = 1440 minutes. (In the Lunar Kalendar there are 15days or Eternities, that is to say 21600 minutes.)Each of the four lokapalas - that is, pairs of World Protectors orguardians - is, therefore, 360 minutes (a quarter of a day) and each pairalso forms in itself a complete cycle or circle (360 degrees). You may calleach pair what you will so long as it be remembered they are a pair:Shiva-Shakti. We call them Dawn, Midday, Sunset and Midnight, or thefour Twilights. In each pair there is light and darkness, yin and yang.These four twilights occur in one Shambhala day, and also in a yearof Shambhala. There are four festivals to mark these four twilights.These occur at the two Equinoxes and two solstices: Spring =Dawn,Summer = Midday, Autumn = Sunset, Winter = Midnight.The diagram overleaf - shows the interplay between light anddark.The Amookos Adinath tradition states that magickal acts and ritesperformed at the twilights are the most efficacious. In the Indiansubcontinent the twilights are said to be the times when Lord Shiva rulesthe earth.The symbols of the four Twilights should be represented in everyZonule or UZ of AMOOKOS. You should attempt to draw them foryourself, or alternatively may visualise the yoni-lingas as describedabove.In your own body the four twilights are represented by the groupsgrouped into two pairs - Cerebral/Genital and Oral/Anal. The formerrests on the nervous system, the latter on the alimentary canal.When taken together, the four Guardians or Lokapalas make up aSphynx, or riddle of Egypt. In the breath-cycle astrology of Amookos,the four angles are exceedingly important. The Angles represent theplanet earth, and the secret centre of that, in Shambhala, is the Wizard-ess or Wizard who sits in the centre of the UZ on the Dragon Seat.Shambhala can be seen as a pyramid, its four sides of Shambhala-Pyramidos representing the four elements. The summit of the Pyramidhas a similar significance to the peak of Mount Shambhala or the centre,Meru-Lingam - if the four conditions are met and are in balance then it"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Tantra Magickmay be said to exist.A word about Shiva and Shakti. Shiva is the primordial god andShakti the primordial goddess. Although there are many differentnames of the God and the Goddess, we Kaulanaths hold that they aresimply adjectives of the primordial God and Goddess. As the Nathsfollowed Nature, so the most natural thing was to visualise the Creatoras a female-male union - after all this is how creation takes place onearth.AstrologyThe art of astrology is an essential adjunct to our work. From determin-ing good times for the performance of rites, knowing the position of theMoon, and for understanding one's own psychology, astrology willprove very useful to you.It is necessary to distinguish between Tropical and Sidereal astrol-ogy. The former enjoys a vogue in the West, and its history is confused.It is based on the Spring Equinox coinciding with 0 degree Aries. Inreality, because of the phenomenon known as the precession of theequinoxes, the Spring Equinox has not coincided with the stars of theconstellation Aries since the 5th Century AD.This means that none of the zodiacal signs, as they are known in theWest, correspond with the actual positions of the constellations whichderive from their names. Sidereal Astrology is based on the constella-tion positions as they actually appear in the sky, and is the astrology ofIndia, Tibet, China, Chaldea and Babylon.If you have previously studied astrology and been satisfied, wewould ask you to temporarily suspend your beliefs and to take a carefullook at our AMOOKOS astrology, the real function of which is aSpiritual one, to become free from the web of rebirth.You may be interested to know that Pythagoras, one of our\"brothers in spirit' is still revered to this day by Hindu Astrologers, whoknow him as Yavanacharya (Sanskrit: The Greek Teacher). The Her-metic Order of the Golden Dawn also promoted the sidereal version ofastrology.At this stage, you are not required to make a comprehensive studyof the principles, but will gradually be introduced to further aspects ofthis work. In the meantime, try to learn the symbols of astrology, andperhaps purchase a current Ephemeris - such as Raphaels' - which givesthe important cosmic phenomena for one year.26The ApprenticeMnemonicsThe first goal of a member of Amookos must be to free herself or himselffrom conditioning, and to think independently. On this all else depends.Much you will find here is not usually classed as 'occult' butproficiency in the methods will be an invaluable aid to visualisation andimagination, essential skills, and also give you an insight into thesubscience called Association of Thought. Aside from any of theseconsiderations, you will find Mnemonics useful in everyday life.Compile a list of words which rhyme with the numbers:1-10, eg 1 Bun, 2 Shoe, 3 Tree, etc. Keep the rhymes simple. Whenyou have made or memorised the list you are ready to proceed. Asksomeone to read you a list of ten objects she or he has thought of. As youhear the words, associate each with the words you have linked to thenumbers, for instance, Apple Bun 1, Car Shoe 2, etc.As you hear the words read out, make an image which links thetwo words. For example, a bun with applesauce, a car in the shape of ashoe. Making these associations, you will be able to remember in anysequence, the list of words read out. Test the person who doesn't knowthis method by reading out ten words and seeing if they can repeat themin any sequence.The second method involves linking each word of a list with thenext word, creating a chain. For example: apple/car (a car in the shapeof an apple); car/dog (a dog with wheels) etc.Practise these methods until you are proficient One objectionoften raised is that these methods seem time-consuming and elaborate.If you try the test of remembering ten words without using eithermethod you will see how helpless you are without them.Further material of greater practical use has been prepared, butfirst become proficient in both of the above methods.PerceptionAs you may have intuited from the Pentagram Rite, perceptual aware-ness is an essential adjunct to our work. One may go very far using onlythese methods. The curriculum of the five Academies of perceptioncommences in the second Grade.The object of this work is not merely to increase the range of thesense organs themselves, but to increase the quality of awareness. Tochange the perception from passive to active.In ordinary development word-association prevents the sensesfrom functioning actively at an early stage in life. All results are to beentered in your diary.27"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Tantra MagickThe ApprenticeSkryingThe development, in positive ways, of the imaginative faculties will aidyour work in many ways.

A glass of black inkcould also be used.Before attempting to skry, open the UZ in the appropriate manner,and sit quietly gazing into the glass. Do not concentrate over much, butrather let the mind flow freely. Observe any images that may arise, andnote them afterwards in your diary. You may try this experiment oncea week.ShambhalaShambhala is a Sanskrit word, occuring in many Hindu texts. It evenappears in dictionaries of the Sanskrit language, giving it the meaningof \"wanton woman\", and a town in Uttar Pradesh. This town still exists,and it is the place where Kalki, the tenth Avatar of Vishnu, and identicalwith Rudrachakrin, is to be reborn at some future time.In Bhagavata Purana (ancient legends of the Divine), reference ismade to Shambhala in this sense. The appearance on earth of the Spiritof Lord Kalki (Kalkinath) marks the period known as Satya Yuga, theAeon of Truth, the Golden Age in the past. This age closes the dark ageof Kali yuga.When the dark age has passed its nadir, and reached a stage ofexhaustion (marked by terror, intrigue, domination and chaos), thespirit of the Divine is to manifest in Shambhala as Lord Kalki. He isassociated with two symbols, that of the flaming sword and the whitehorse.Flaming sword may also be expressed as a sword of flame, as itdoes not mean sword in an aggressive sense, but a flame shaped like asword. In detail, this flame means a new dispensation, a new Way ofLife, new and different values which are to bring light to people whohave endured in darkness. The sword implies destruction as the newwill destroy the old way's systems and ideas.The white horse is important because this animal is not an indige-nous animal to India. It came originally from the lands North, East andWest of the Himalayas. It therefore indicates something foreign, or fromoutside India. A new way of life cannot be a continuity of something old.All of the foregoing has a deeper meaning than might be expected.28We do not interpret Kalki as an actual person to incarnate on earth, butrather a symbol of something, some inner impulse which has to flowerwithin us.The dark age represents conditioned being, the spirit of Kalki thelight which is the light of spirit. Not being dependent on the old orancient, the only weapon to achieve this internal New Aeon is that oftruth.Many books have suggested an actual Shambhala exists or existed,a place where everything was sweetness and light. We have to rejectthis. If this country of peace, freedom and happiness is to exist, then itmust be an internal place. For these reasons we come across Shambhalaas being located at various points within the human body.In Amookos we sometimes call ourselves Shambhala Interna-tional, because any place which is a meeting point for Kaula Naths maybe said to be a Shambhala - but only if we are courageous and openenough to embrace truth.Shambhala and the Left Hand Path (VarnaMarg)If we investigate the differences between an esoteric (left hand) and anexoteric (right hand) path, we can construct a comparative chartShambhala  AghartiLeft hand path  Right hand pathHard to grasp  Easy to graspTantrik  OrthodoxyScience  SuperstitionMeditation  Priestcraft/prayer'Left hand path' in India has not the same derogatory connotationas in the West. It means the path where sexuality and death are takeninto account, where being individual is important, where there are norules. Right hand paths lay down rules for the orthodox to follow - noeffort is required according to the priests; just follow the instructionsand you will go to heaven.It is necessary to mention here that due to its antinomian tendency,the Shambhala path suffers greatly at the hands of uninitiated writers.Attempts have been made to lay all the crimes of mankind at the handsof the Tantriks, people whose only crime was not to try and changeothers. In Amookos we have a saying: Don't try and change the world,just make sure it doesn't change you.In the right hand paths the weeds of politics and priestcraftflourish - it is the land of easy answers, rationalizations, control of the29"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"masses, \"God is on our side\", and labels for everything.MeditationFew are born with the ability to practice the different esoteric patternsand most need to develop and formulate them through meditation.This is a most practical means by which we may know and recallthat which has never really been lost, the identity of ourselves with theDivine.There can never be an universal meditation system for all people.Most do best when they settle for their own individual patterns.Guidance only can be given.

Trance, unconsciousness and sleep areinstruments of defeat.in the preliminary and early exploratory mind wanderings, con-centrate by counting the breaths. Count the breath as it moves in andout, one to seven, repeat. Breath is synonymous in Amookos with theDivine. We have words in our language which express this - atmosphereof Greek origin has the same root as atman of Sanskrit, meaning spirit,or breath.It should be clear that it is not necessary to meditate 'on' anything.It is enough in the early stages to just observe the processions of trains-of-thought. It is not the aim of meditation practice to obliterate thought.This would be impossible. The aim of meditation is to disentangle theobserver, the measurer from the sea of thoughts in which she or he isnormally entangled.By observing the chains, many hints as to one's own word-webmay be discovered. These often have emotional bases, and can form theseed or nucleus of obstacles, conditioning and dark thoughts.Be sure to record carefully in your diary the results of your work.The Siddhis - Psychic RealmsThis paper covers a wide variety of subjects in brief form. It is notclaimed for this paper that it is a comprehensive guide to the differenttopics. Members of AMOOKOS are encouraged to explore thesesubjects for themselves according to their interests.It has been our experience in twenty-four years of study thataccomplishment in these siddhis (magickal powers) is very much rarerthan one would think from the vast amount of literature relating tothem. Many people claim expertise but the student should beware oftaking such claims on face value.The AMOOKOS standpoint is that some people seem to be bornwith a share of these siddhis, but conditioning and mind-fog obscuresthem. If an active spiritual disposition arises in an individual then thesiddhis arise naturally. There seems to be an inbuilt protection againsttheir full development in someone not pursuing a spiritual path. This isnot to say that everyone claiming such powers are frauds, there arepeople who either genuinely believe they possess such powers or elseactually do possess them to some extent. The AMOOKOS membershould cultivate an open mind tempered with a healthy scepticism.A times in local Zonules groups may experiment with thesetechniques in a practical fashion.PsychometryThis is the ability to pick up information psychically from objects. Thisis sometimes extended to include photographs or pictures of people orplaces. Every object is said to somehow 'soak up' psychic emanations. Ifsuch an object has been in close proximity with an individual it mayhave a field surrounding it or permeating it which reflects that of itsowner.As a guide to practice our advice would always be to set up yourUZ before experimenting. Take the object and hold it lightly. Allow yourmind to relax, and observe any images or words which may arise. It isimportant to aid rejecting information, and for this reason it seems to beimportant to say the first thing which occurs to you, however ludicrousor ridiculous it may seem.Astral TravelThis is a very popular subject, and there are many books relating to it.However it is important to be sure that you have the same understand-ing of the term as the author. What is called out of the body experienceor Astral Travel by psychics and experimenters is often confused withthe process of creative imagination practised by the Golden Dawn andother modern western magickal orders.We talk here about Out Of the Body Experience related to whatpsychics often term the 'etheric' body. This is considered by many to bea simulacrum of the physical body existing in a subtle form, and attachedto the physical body by a subtle cord. There are many techniques related"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Tantra MagickThe Apprenticeto this practice. Sometimes separation of the 'etheric' from the physicalbody occurs spontaneously. This is discussed further in chapter three.Everyone's experience seems to differ slightly. It is possible to trainin the various techniques to accomplish separation. However it is ofteneasier to travel by British Airways than to accomplish it.Clairvoyance and ClairaudienceThese words imply the ability to 'see' or hear psychically. There arespiritists who claim the ability to see spirit guides and souls. Once againdiscrimination should be employed. Use your own standards to judgevalidity.Magickal Links and Psychic AttackA psychic link between an object and an individual (as in psychometry)can be used for magickal purposes - according to shamans and wizardsof past and present. For this reason such things as nail clippings, hairand bodily secretions have always been regarded as things whichshould be carefully disposed of. Paranoia creeps in here. Remember thata person calling herself or himself a wizard or a witch does not mean sheor he is one.In our experience genuine 'psychic attack' is an exceedingly rarephenomenon. If on the other hand, you take it upon yourself to attemptsuch an attack upon another, remember that in AMOOKOS such acourse may only be taken after consulting two other Yogi-Magicians ofthe Middle Temple. It is very rare for such an attempt to be warranted- look to yourself for the muddy reasons behind your motives of darkand revenge.As far as initiates of AMOOKOS go there is no reason for anyoneto fear 'psychic attack' by others. Our line is very old and our membersare protected by the Guardians and Fierce Dakinis of the Sampradaya orline of initiation. If in a difficult pass as a result of your experiments youmay call on the Line to protect you.PsychokinesisA way of moving objects by the power of the mind or by psychic means.Much in the news in the last decade because of the tricks of Uri Gellerand other forkbenders. Remember that skilled conjurors are capable ofproducing effects which seem to baffle the mind and defy explanation.If such things were possible there would be no need for governments tospend millions of pounds on weapon technology. This point also appliesto other psychic 'abilities'.It is known that both the US and the USSR governments havesponsored research into psychic abilities - but such experiments are only32to be expected and do not necessarily mean that government agenciesbelieve they work. All avenues are investigated.AurasMany ancient traditions aver that individuals have a field of psychicenergy capable of being discerned by sensitive individuals. Howeverthis subject too suffers from too much literature and not enoughpractical experimentation.Beware of literature which gives 'pat' meanings to aura colours.Every individual differs. This subject is different from 'charisma' whichevery Amookos member should cultivate.BioenergyBioenergy, life-energy, Chi or whatever term given refers to the subtleenergy which seems to mark the difference between a corpse and aliving human being. This energy seems to be of a fluidic nature and canbe blocked in its passage by muscular or mental blocks. The AMOOKOSaim is to have it flowing freely and available at all times. The Tantrikterm for it is Prana-Shakti, the energy or shakti which is related inti-mately to the processing of food, breath and impressions.

A copyof Tantrik Astrology1 should be obtained.It is essential that you grasp the major differences between Tropi-cal Zodiac (TZ) and Sidereal Zodiac (SZ).AMOOKOS Time Lore is founded on the following alchemicalprinciples:- that which is above is like that which is below (Macro Microcos-mos);- every natural process in the Cosmos is based on the same naturallaws as every other process - learn from nature;- one's own true Being or Spirit or Shiva particle is free from time.We can see Time as Shakti.All planets, constellations, and planetary aspects in an Amookosbreath chart (or horoscope) can become the powers and energies of anAdinath. Usually they enslave a person by unconscious identification,caused by the breath taking on a certain rhythm at birth. One may betheir Master or Mistress (Nath).In the rosary of a Nath there are 108 beads. In an Amookos breathchart there are 108 parts of the Moon.The Body YantraintroductionYou must make very serious efforts to understand this symbol, as on itmuch of the AMOOKOS curriculum depends.In essence the Body Yantra is a simplified Shri Yantra. The dot inthe centre or bindu represents Adinatha, that is to say Consciousness-Awareness."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Strive to expand this table by yourself. It has to be stressed thatthese three fundamental qualities cannot be studied in isolation, nor dothey exist except in relationship with each other. The whole triangle canalso be seen as the circle of Adinatha's Shaktis or Energies called Will(Iccha), Knowledge (]nana) Action (Kriya).We have to examine these powers in a practical way. Will is alsodetermination, resolution. Knowledge is know-how, lack of ignoranceabout any given thing. Action is the means of accomplishing what iswilled.To take a practical example: to bake a cake you have to set theobjective and be prepared to carry it through to the end, despite anyobstacles. This is Will.You have to know how to do it - the recipe, oven setting, etc.You have to actually do it! You have to use instruments, the bowl,the oven, the mixing spoon. You have to assemble the required materi-als.Only in this way through the combination of the three, can thedesired object be brought into existence. Therefore, before undertakingany project you are asked as an AMOOKOS member to firstly make apowerful resolution to carry things through. Secondly you must ensurethat you have the necessary knowledge. Thirdly you must do it. Youshould apply these three Shaktis in every endeavour. Apply this to alland everything.You will see from this that the most basic yantra from which allothers proceed isIt symbolises the union of the three Shako's.The Body Yantra shown on page 44, consists of five circles or man-dalas:1 The Bindu, potential, Adinath2 The Triangle3 Circle of eight petals (planets)4 Circle of twelve petals (constellations)5 Square of four gates or the magickal enclosureIt is the central triangle which gives rise to the various modifica-tions shown by the petals. In this second degree we will be working witha yantra in which the circle of twelve petals is omitted.A yantra can be constructed in two ways:Bhu (Skt, Earth) Flat, 2-dimensionalMeru (Skt, a Mountain) Rising to a point or pyramidThe Body Yantra illustrated above has twenty-seven points of En-ergy; from the outside working in they are four elements, twelve Con-stellations, eight planets, three fundamental qualities, (as describedabove). The bindu, which is identical with you, the wizard upon thedragon Seat, is outside Time or Space, and has no number or character-istics except Consciousness-Awareness. It is the True Being, or Spirit, orShiva Particle.These twenty-seven points of energy are also the letters of thealphabet, counting the blank space as an additional character. They arethe root of all mantra.The number twenty-seven is of some importance to AMOOKOSwork, and its value and significance will become steadily apparent toyou. It is a key which unlocks and unblocks human psychology - as itdoes so it draws together all the elements of our Tradition.The circle ofthe eight planetsshows a modifica-tion of the pointsShiva and Shakti.The table belowshows how theseemanate from eachother"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Tantra MagickEsquires and HandmaidensThe Body Yantra should be thought of as a mapping of Macrocosmonto the Microcosm, here for example, the cosmos onto the body: this issummarized in the legendary Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistos:\"I speak not fictitious things, but that which is certain and mosttrue.

You were asked to meditate on thesethree great Lights of sun, moon and fire (page 23).The realization of these Three in One is one of our great secrets.Moon is Knowledge and IntellectSun is emotional Feeling and WillFire is bodily Sensation and ActionThe question you have to ask yourself is: What is the fourth?A Nath is a human of higher intellect who gives equal importanceto these three in Her or His being. For such a person the world may beheld in the palm of the hand. It should be clearly understood thateducation emphasizes only one of these lights - knowledge.This disaster produces psychopaths and sociopaths devoid offeeling and bodily sensation. The Chalice of Shambhala, or ShambhalaVajra, into which is poured the Nectar of Adinatha is one unified Whole.Part of your task in this grade is to correct the imbalance in your ownnature, to uncover the Moon.Meditate for ten minutes daily on the following points: do I feel mybody? Do I sense my emotions?

It is called Ayurveda. For a human to be healthy her or his body,made of the three Qualities, should be in harmony. For this to occur abody requires food.

Then drawa Yantra appropriate to the particular Shakti, and Her worship isaccomplished in a similar way, substituting Her subsidiary attendantsfor the eight planetary Shaktis.Work in these lesser Yantras should be performed on similar linesas the Great Body Yantra. The magician has to win their love to gainsuccess. This implies repeated practice and also suitable offerings. In thecase of the Yellow Goddess, yellow flowers, yellow powder, yellowcloth, etc are to be used.The Body Yantra and the Tradition of TantraThe Body Yantra is a Kalachakra Yantra - one that deals with the Wheelof Time, and is a synthesis of the Yantras of the Devis or Goddesses Kaliand Lalita.The eight yoginis on the eight petals of the Yantra represent theeight planets Pluto, Mercury, Jupiter Saturn, Venus, Uranus, Neptune,Mars. Three Yoginis in the central triangle represent Moon Sun and Fire.Four yoginis on the gates of the diagram represent the four elements, orthe four twilights. The bindu or point in the centre of the Body Yantra isShiva-Shakti-Samarasa (Sexual Union) or Perfect Assimilation. It is50Esquires and Handmaidensfrom their union that the whole Yantra proceeds.When actually performing the ritual, you should spend a consid-erable period visualizing the Goddess as residing in one's heart, Thevisualize her being 'drawn out' of your body by your breath and placedin the centre of the Yantra. Once She has been invoked into the centre,the rest of the ritual must proceed as if She were actually present in theYantra. So one should bow to Her, give Her flowers, fruit, and othersuitable things, and finally give Her your own complex of Yoginis.As the Devi resides in your body surrounded by her Yoginis(which people mistakenly take to be their own powers), the ritual is anaffirmation of a situation which can actually be taken to exist at all times.Adinath Shiva, free from Time, the Witness, has no powers or energies.It is Devi only who enjoys, feels, thinks, etc, etc.In this particular ritual you are taking the Devi as in one of herParticular aspects as Lady of Time. The affirmation or offering couldtherefore take the form:O Devi, I give you my body (Earth), emotions (Sun), mind (Moon),vigour (Mars), imagination (Neptune), sense of analysis (Ura-nus), affection (Venus), sorrow (Saturn) happiness (Jupiter), senseof logic (Mercury), sense of detachment (Pluto). Take my whole day(Dawn, Midday, Sunset, Midnight) and my whole night.Offerings to the DeviIn this ritual anything may be offered to the Devi when She isseated in the centre of the Yantra. Every tantric tradition insists thatanimal sacrifice should be given to the Devi. The mantra Svaha at the endof a string of Bija5 mantras indicates this sacrifice. If an animal isoffered, it is said that it must be male. This is because the sadhaka ormagician is taken as male. The highest sacrifice is a human being, andonly kings may perform this sacrifice.Traditionally, Tantra tells us that the 'King' is a Vira or Hero whois prepared to offer his life to Devi.

All of thememploy the same structure for ritual there are variations - for examplewhile we invoke the great Shakti of Time into her Yantra, Shiva isinvoked into a stone representing the penis, Vishnu into a spiral stone(Shalagrama) Ganapati into a red stone, etc, etc. But whatever the base,the ritual dynamic remains the same.It is important not to be misled about ritual. In the West, which isrelatively ritual-free, esotericists tend to think that simply doing a ritualaccomplishes what is desired. This might even be justified by calling theritual a 'spell'. But a ritual is iconographic. Its form and structure tell usmany things about the people who devised it. For this reason ritualsshould not be altered indiscriminately.So deep thought and pondering about the structure and compo-nents of a ritual is a necessity for a Tantrik. After all, many millions ofordinary folk in India perform Tantrik rituals without any understand-ing of their dynamics. This means that people are pacing out magickcircles, performing banishing rituals, using Yantras.So you should very carefully examine the structure of the BodyYantra Ritual with all its elements for an understanding of its purposeand aims. To simply take them on face value is to miss their point.7Amulet of the Great Goddess of TimeYou may read this amulet or armour during the rite as an offering to theGoddess installed in the Yantra. It may, alternatively be written onpaper, and the Goddess installed into it, later to be worn on the person.52Esquires and HandmaidensAlternatively it may be used as a rite of general protection when recitedat one of the four twilights.OmMay Shiva with his shakti of Time protect me in my heart!May the Shakti of Knowledge protect my brain!May the Shakti of Action protect my genitals!Nila Shakti protect my brain, Pita Devi shield my forehead!Malini-Devi, dance on my tongue!

On being served well by devotion, He alone is theirredeemer. The five Kleshas that have become fetters are Ignorance,Ego, Attraction, Revulsion, Clinging to Life\".(Linga Purana, II, 9)Practical work with these five obstacle blocks is a major secret ofthe Nath tradition. This part of your work stems from a very ancient andcentral tradition within the Sampradaya (or line of initiation). The 5 ObBlocks must be combatted individually, and their tangled ramifications54Esquires and Handmaidenswithin us should be the subject of repeated meditation and study.This work is very inner. If you do not yet have a copy of TwilightYoga you should obtain one.1. IgnoranceThis can take many forms. For example, thinking we know what isreal when we have no basis for such a thought. Remember the fivesensory joys of a Knight Of Shambhala: the five senses refined andawakened. As a conditioned product it is certain that you suffer to agreater of lesser extent from the drug called hypnosis. Your senses aredull and base, and you sense only what you are conditioned to sense.This is only one aspect of the Ignorance Ob-Block. If your senses areobscured, how can it be possible to perceive what is real or imaginary.2. EgoThe imaginary opinion we have of ourselves which can also takemany varied forms. The idea that we are capable or incapable of someor many things which the evidence of our actions contradict. Thisopinion may be deflated (masochism) or inflated (narcissism). Eitherway it is not true. Ask yourself what has given birth to such a monster?Do your words, appearance, or whatever you 'value' about yourselfcompensate for a stultified inner existence? Are you such a wondrousbeing that none of this could possibly apply to you? Investigate, experi-ment and verify.3. RevulsionNothing in itself is horrible, but our attitude of mind gives it itscolour. How many things do you dislike simply because you areconditioned? Customs, local mores and ethics are all rejected by theKaula Nath. If you are repulsed by anything trace it back to its root. Howdid you know it was horrible? Who told you? The natural person actingspontaneously has no need of conditioned ideas. One of Shiva's namesis \"Aghora\" meaning nothing in itself is horrible. Conditioned by therevulsion Klesha we set ourselves artificial limits.4. AttachmentThe false idea that we possess anything. \"This is mine.\" Identifi-cation with all sorts of ideas, things, people. The inability to realize thatwe are as much a part of nature as the things we claim for our own. Theinability to realize that it is what we need - rather than what we want -which is important.5. Clinging to LifeRefusing to submit to natural laws. Trying to make two go intothree or refusal to accept the inevitable. Lack of ability to surrender, orto give in. This has many undesirable side-effects, including the inabilityto give ourselves to anything or anyone.55"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Tantra MagickWorking on these Ob-Blocks is an essential element of the WisdomTeaching of Amookos. Now is the time to start dissolving the fivekleshas with their entanglements.You cannot be a master until you have tackled the Ob-Blocks inyourself, and there can be no magick with them. The Kleshas apply onmany levels and are in fact the horrible shadows of the pure elements.We will discuss this further in chapter three. Reach to their essence andyou are free of them.The Human MultichordWe may see the human frame as containing a multitude of stringedinstruments, each of which vibrates at a certain rate. Many will be foundby the wise to be out of tune. In some cases this disharmony can wreckthe whole.Unnecessarily tense muscles can rob a person of energy. In mostcases the muscle groups which are chronically tense will be unconscious- that is, we are unaware of them.These tensions, judged as a collective or aggregate, form armours,nets or types which may permit no free expression and preclude theinflow and outflow of mother nature in her many forms.Nets or armours fall into distinct groups in accordance with Time-Breath Science. See the section on Time Lore in the first Grade paper:popularly this is known as an individual's horoscope. This matter isdiscussed in some detail later and in the book Tantrik Astrology (seebibliography). An individual approach based on accurate knowledge isessential.The armours fall into two categories depending on their relation toSun and Moon; Hard and Soft. The three Shaktis of Sun, Moon and Firein a person form a triple octave so that which is structured in bodily ten-sion is also reflected intellectually and in the emotions.For these reasons a purely intellectual or one-sided approach toproblems, pathologies and conditioning fails. Tendencies to armouringare birth born.We must never forget that we are, in Tantrik terminology, Hero-ines and Heroes. The inner and oral tradition is that Yoginis and Shaktisexist simply for the purpose of keeping our minds off these problems. Soresolution is of the utmost importance, as we are on the path of return.Why is it said that the Kaula Nath way is as narrow as a razor edge? Itis because we are willfully setting ourselves as Heroines and Heroes ina battle we must win, but which the ordinary person cannot even face.56Esquires and HandmaidensAcademy of symbolismThe Significance of Dattatreya(Initiates of AMOOKOS were given a copy of the Dattatreya Upanishad,translated into English, and published in the Adyar Library Series.8Upanishad means secret or esoteric doctrine - oral lore. There aresaid to be one hundred and eight Upanishads, this being an idealnumber. The Dattatreya Upanishad is assimilated to the fourth or socalled Magickal Veda - Atharva Veda.Veda means knowledge or ritual lore. An Upanishad may havenothing to do with religion. It is either genuine magickal lore, or, in somecases an attempt to imitate the genuine article. Many Upanishadspresent a whole body of the highest or spiritual esoteric lore in thebriefest space.Dattatreya is credited with being an enlightened being who wasthe first expounder of the Agamas and Tantras. He is the alleged authorof the Avadhoot Gita and it the promulgator of the Shri Vidya. He is theGuru or Guide figure of all India, the prototype of all Yogis and Sadhus,and the legendary founder of the Naths.He is mentioned in sacred texts, such as Upanishads, Puranas andTantras. In the Shrimad Bhagavata a large section deals with him asAvadhoot 9. Modern images of Dattatreya often show him clothed.This panders to a modern puritanism and modesty, for of old and bytradition he is always spoken of as completely naked.A whole lore exists on this nakedness. The Sanskrit word isdigambara, meaning clothed with the directions of Space.Many legends are associated with him, although very few have sofar been translated into English. Very often he is said to appear to peopleas naked, chewing betel, with a naked Shakti on his left lap, eating hogmeat and drinking wine.We can learn from this that he is a figure having little to do withorthodoxy. The pig is abhorred in India. Wine is said by the orthodox tobe under Brahma's curse. Nakedness is prohibited by the Right Hand orOrthodox. Datta is the eternal Shaman, Shiva himself, rejecting alluseless rules and living according to his own True Will or Law. This isSvecchacharya - the Path of Own Will.At least one thousand years before Buddha, Lord Datta is said tohave achieved enlightenment under the Audumber Tree. It is possiblethat this early legend gave rise to the Buddhist story.The image of Dattatreya can tell us something about his signifi-cance and occult meaning. He has three heads, six arms, stands on the57"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Tantra Magickworld, is flanked by a cow, and surrounded by four dogs. He wears redpadukas (wooden sandals).

TheCosmic Shaman.Today Datta is often worshipped or propitiated as a god. Thisprocess often happens to people in India. Datta is especially popular inthe regions Saurashtra and Maharashtra. In the South of India he is thefocus of a purely devotional cult.The Academy of the Five SensesYou must take the practices described here very seriously and makeconscientious efforts to adhere to the six month schedule.The word \"Academy\" is derived from Akademos, a Greek demi-god who gave his name to the garden in which Plato taught hisfollowers. Now it indicates a place of study, a college, or a university.Tantriks evolved five symbols to represent what Western oc-cultism calls the five elements.10During a day of 21600 breaths, symbol of Macrocosm-Microcosm,a particular element may be more powerful than any other, as we sawwith dark and light in chapter one. Just as the power of an elementwaxes, so too it wanes, and the next element in the sequence becomesinfluential.Every time-bound thing is composed of these five elements,whether the 'thing' is dead or alive. Thus a living human body and acorpse are both composed of the five elements. It is only when theDivine Triangle of awake-awareness enters into the Thing that it be-comes animated or alive.This is a basis for our five flowering arrows of AMOOKOS, which58Esquires and Handmaidensyou will recall from the Pentagram Rite of the First Degree. The arrowsare the five senses, composed of the five elements. An arrow symbolizesforce going outward, the flowery arrow represents an Inner and anOuter movement. When the Triangle or Awake Awareness enters thenthe five Arrows or Senses flower. In the third degree the names andagencies of these five Great Goddesses or Maha Shaktis are revealed.Work in the five Academies consists of ensuring that your sensesor instruments or Shaktis are charged to the limit with the divine Shivaenergy or Awake/Awareness. In other words, you must turn dry sticksinto flowering blooms. The importance of these exercises cannot beoverstressed. They form an indispensable foundation for your own CityOf Shambhala or Maha Zonule.The Microcosmic MahazonuleTo understand the purpose of the six month exercise it becomes necessaryto introduce some further concepts. We consider Shiva-Shakti as ultimatelyinseparable, a unity. This is represented by the Bindu or point at thecentre of a downward pointing triangle. Shiva is the Bindu of Awake-Awareness, Shakti is the triangle formed of Iccha (Will), Jnana (Knowledge)and Kriya (Action).These three Shaktis together constitute the Triple Goddess, some-times called Lalita (She Who Plays). These three symbolize the threeGunas or Primordial Threads or Qualities, from which is woven theCosmos -Reconciling (Fire), Active (Sun) and Passive (Moon). By mu-tual blendings these three create the whole manifestation.Maya - Goddess of IllusionBecause of the large number of possible blendings and reblendings,Awake Awareness (Shiva) may seem to become identified, conditioned,and confused. This illusion and delusion is called Maya - sometimespersonified by a very alluring Goddess. She is also called KanchukiDevi, that is, the Goddess of the Sheaths. These are five fold in number,so-called the five limitations.1 of Action (limited Kriya Shakti)2 of Knowledge (limited Jnana Shakti)3 by Desire (limited Iccha Shakti)4 by Time5 by FateThrough the innumerable possible blendings and reblendings, theindividual forgets she or he is Shakti-Shiva and considers herself orhimself to be a limited individual (Purusha) with a certain nature59"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Tantra Magick(Prakriti). This certain nature, a reflection or shadow or false image ofShakti, has a mental apparatus which is itself also a reflection of Iccha,Jnana and Kriya Shaktis.For instance, the \"I\", or ego, or personal identity (Ahamkara) is thereflection of Iccha, and causes the Individual to think all that exists canbe appropriated by him or herself - rather than Shiva-Shakti\". Mind(Manas) is the main factor relating to association of thoughts, caused bythe sense-impressions. The Intelligence (Buddhi) is that which under-stands the significance of external or internal sense-impressions.The five elements are organized as a vehicle of Shiva-Shakti. Theyare animated by the triangle of Awake Awareness, with powers ofaction and powers of sensing.The five powers of action are Excreting, Sexing, Grasping, Movingand Speaking. The five powers of Sensing are Smelling, Tasting, Seeing,Feeling and Hearing. By means of these ten instruments a human beingis able to move in the world and sense the five impressions:Scent Taste Sight Touch SoundThe five impressions which go round and roundThese five impressions, in union with the three reflections of Iccha,Jnana and Kriya Shaktis constitute the Subtle Body, which may survivephysical death.At all times remember your unity with Shiva/Shakti. If you forget,or in our terminology are conditioned to forget this unity with Shiva/Shakti, the influx of sense impressions can create a new Maya or confu-sion. Thus ends the discussion on the thirty-six Tattvas of traditionalTantrika.Practical WorkExperience shows that many people cease to be aware of their surroundingsat an early age. The mental apparatus has a peculiar tendency to buildup internal images, often randomly associated with other internalimages, and compounded by word-descriptions. These in turn, act toprevent further sensing.As an example, we have the word 'red' and most people would saythat they understand what colour this word implies. Yet holding theconcept of 'redness' can cause us to be unaware of the possible grada-tions. Our language is constructed in such a way that we usual ignorethe shades of red. Our internal conception of many words can cause usto Ignore the evidence of our senses. The map is not the territory.A word can conjure up an internal image of the object it represents,yet the internal images may differ from every individual, and may berandomly associated with many other images and objects.60Esquires and HandmaidensThe curriculum which follows is intended to explore the limita-tions and conditionings which must be destroyed before further workcan proceed. It is very important that you keep a separate and completerecord of your twenty six weeks of sense experiment. The curriculumcannot end after twenty six weeks.

No special preparations arenecessary. Spend between five and ten minutes on it. Perform it whilelying in bed, upon awakening.With both feet together, visualize that a Flame of Great Effulgencewhich is the Fire at the End of Time, is kindled in the big toe of your leftfoot.

Its efficacy is said to live in thefact that it is the form of the Absolute, Sun and Moon together, and it isa mantra which all people recite 21600 times every day through theirbreathing.It is thus the form of time; as the Zodiakos has 21600 minutes, and"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"is a complete circle, so macro-cosm and microcosm have 21600breaths, which is Hamsa.It is a secret of the Nath-Kaulas that \"Time is Breath\"Hamsa is said to be Sh-abdabrahman or the Absolute assound.Lord Shiva or Adinath issaid to have five faces. Each mouthuttered mantras, tantras andyantras so that people could befreed from the ocean of samsara,or the wheel of time. Four of hisfaces are in the cardinal pointsand there is an upper face fromwhich proceeded the Hamsa andall-pervading mantra.The Hamsa or swan is saidto be the vehicle of Brahma or theAbsolute. Parahamsa is the namegiven to one who has attained tothat, unknown to us, state beyond Hamsa.Hamsa is the maintenance or inbetween state between Creationand Dissolution. Hamsa upholds the microcosm, which is also themacrocosmos.The letter 'Sa' is Creation, and 'Ham' is Dissolution in the continu-ous breaths of a human being, this takes the form HA-Sa-HA. HA-Sa byrule of grammar becomes HAMSa or the Absolute's vehicle. Sa+HA byrule of grammar becomes SO-AH AM (Her or Shiva I am)This continual sound of the Absolute is present within the heart ofevery man and every woman. Hamsa is said to be the Goddess Gayatri,seed of all Vedas.However, within the mantra Hamsa is contained a very ancientNath-science connected with the interplay in the human body betweensun and moon. The breath is influenced by the various planets which arethe rays or sheaths of sun and moon. When breath resorts to Hamsa,which is sun and moon conjoined, time stops and one is free ofKalachakra and Shiva-Shakti oneselfThe subject of Mantra cannot be divorced from the power of wordsgenerally. All words are made up of letters of the alphabet. In AMOOKOSthe collectivity of these words is a Great Shakti or Female Energy.Study of sound in the Academy of the Five Senses should havedemonstrated to you beyond doubt that what people say is often notwhat they mean, or what you think them to mean. \"Big\" words likejustice, peace, love inspire people to various activities, and you shouldalways be aware that one word may mean very different things todifferent people. Because of this great hypnotic power we call misGoddess Maya.Meditate on this point: Can Association of Thought exist withoutwords?A very well known phenomenon in hypnotism is the 'post hyp-notic suggestion'. When someone is in the hypnotic trance it is sug-gested to them that on being awakened they will perform some or otheract, often using a word by the hypnotist as a trigger. For example it maybe suggested that on hearing the word 'moon' the person will stand up.It has been noted that after people have carried out an action on atrigger word, if they are asked why they, in our example, stood up, theywill give some very plausible reason. They may say \"I stood up becauseI thought I saw someone I know out of the window\" or \"I felt as if Iwanted to stretch my legs\". It doesn't matter how many times they are'triggered', they will always produce an excuse which may even makeyou doubt what you know.This phenomenon is made use of by stage hypnotists, and theaudience laugh at such stupidity. But the really laughable thing is thatmost people perform most actions in a state of hypnosis, and very oftenplausibly give 'reasons' which explain their actions. Ha Ha Ha.The medium of hypnosis may be (1) words of others (2) emotionsof others (3) unconscious imitation of others. The hypnotic subject is ofa conditioned nature, a receptive and gullible robot whose whole beingmay contain nothing but other peoples' words.As Adinaths we should made concerted attempts to test the truthof these statements above for ourselves, with an open mind, in ordinarylife.Yoginis of the Body YantraHere are the full meditations on the Yoginis of the Body Yantra.

It is the diagrammatic form of the Goddess, consid-ered as the Body or the Cosmos.She is the Shakti of Time, orKali. Her partner, with whomShe is One, is Mahakala Adinath- Free from Time.However, as the Shri Yan-tra is connected with the processof Creation, as this creation isprimarily a sexual process, Kaliis figured in the Shri Yantrasymbolism as Lalita, the erotic orplayful form.We learn from Nature thatfor creation to occur, the spermof a man and the egg of a womanneed to come together.

It is not static, it is always in movement. If wetake it as a separate thing it is only in order to understand this change,and not because it is a fixed symbol.Two plants or People give rise to a third. Taken in isolation the ShriYantra represents a human being, a Micro-Macrocosmos, the Body ofTime. As Kali is Time and Manifestation, so too Adinath is sometimesfigured as a corpse, or Witness of this Manifestation.Lalita is also known as Tripura (three cities). These three cities areHer Shaktis or powers of Will - Knowledge - Action, and Creation -Maintenance - Destruction. They are also the three cities called Knower-Means of Knowledge-Known, or, as in our first degree, Measurer-Means of Measuring-Measured.

Twelve plusfifteen - the twenty-seven letters of the AMOOKOS alphabet.The Flowering of the YantraThe eight petals and the sixteen petals together are the twenty-fouraspects6 of the Sun and Moon with the eight planets, but not with oneanother.

(The Lord ShivaAdinath is beyond Time.) When the plant has flowered it is a humanbody. Before this it is in creation, or growth.Shri Yantra as a BodyThe Bindu, or point in the centre represents Shiva-Shakti Samarasa - theunion of Shiva and Shakti.The little triangle in the centre represents the Chalice of Shambhala,84Craftsmen and Craftswomenor Moon, Sun and Fire, which are in the body as brain, heart or nerveplexus, and the grey matter in the spine.The eight triangles represent the Knower or the Measurer, and isthe City or Circle of the Knower.The Two sets of circles each with ten triangles represent the meansof knowledge and action, the five senses and the five ways of actiontogether with the five impressions and the five elements. This is the Cityof the Means of Knowledge, or the Measuring Stick.The circle with fourteen triangles represents the fourteen maincurrents of Psychic Energy in the Body, and thence all their extensions.The eight petalled circle symbolises the sexual powers and attrac-tions in the body, and the sixteen petalled circle symbolises the meansof attraction.The Earth square or Magick Enclosure is the physical body of theindividual with its various elements.There are thus nine circles of the complete Shri Yantra (Micro-Macrocosmos). In each circle Lalita exists in a triple form, presidingover the Shaktis or powers of each of the Circles.

Jvala is less known than Lalita orKalika, but sits on a volcano and showers forth ashes.Lalita herself is said to be of three forms - a Girl, a Mother and anOld Woman. These relate to the Power of Menstruation, to Creation,Maintenance and Destruction. We can see that the Erotic Form of Lalitahas within Herself all elements, taken in a particular aspect or way.The Fifteen Eternities of the Goddess of the Shri Yantra havenames like lady of Sexual Desire, Yoni Adorned with Flowers, Lady ofthe Form of Fire, She who is always Wet, etc. Each of the mantras of theseDevis are of an erotic nature, in consonance with the Presiding Goddessof the Circle.Smashing the Five KleshasCutting the tanglewood thicketThe second degree papers gave a brief outline of the tanglewood calledfive ob-blocks.

This \"I\" is nothing more than a piece ofdriftwood to cling to and call my own, then what remains when I die?Surely if there is something of ourselves that is immortal it cannot bethis.Ignorance Ob-BlockMeditate on this: If \"I\" am so mistaken as to identify \"Myself\"with such partial aspects of the universe and call them \"I\" or \"mine\"then how can I claim knowledge of any other sphere or thing. How canI hope to see the wood in the midst of such a dense and tangled thicket?Techniques for klesha-smashing using astrologicaltheatreThe stage for this theatre is everyday life. The other actors are uncon-scious.Act One - Mars and Neptune.The sexual roleplay. Passivus is opposed and attracted by Activus.The technique is to assume either Mars or Neptune and observe howother people's Mars or Neptune reacts with yours. You have to makeyour act thoroughgoing and this implies that you are familiar withspeech, voice pattern and muscle tone of the body. This is how Mars andNeptune function in relation to women and men.This should be helpful to you. The following notes on Mars/herois derived from the post Reichians.

What distinguishes the group Venus, Uranus, Neptune andMars from Pluto, Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn is that the former aresexually based and the planets Venus-Uranus-Neptune-Mars functionin a sexual and interactive way within the pairs. Why?A reason may be found in the order of the planets from the sunoutwards excluding earth, which isAs contrasted with the known planetary pairs. We know that thisorder is:But if you examine the first list again you will see the planets in theorderHow does the model for the planets work in a human organism. Tounderstand this we will employ Gurdjieff's Enneagram - a very usefuldevice in understanding octaves and patterns of growth and decay.Place the planets on the enneagram as in the second diagram, andwe have an explanation for both the Tamasic and Rajasic outwardexpressions of the planets Pluto, Neptune, Uranus and Saturn (on theleft side) belonging to darkness. Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiterbelong to light.The pairs arise as follows: Pluto-Mercury and Jupiter Saturnadhere together as pairs. Neptune, Uranus, Mars and Venus and theirinterplay are represented by:"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Soft and soft do not go together, and neither do hard and hard.Of course the yoni must be soft and the penis hard for this interplayto come about. The moon is soft and the sun is hard.The Great Treatise in the I Ching confirms the astrological and theAMOOKOS view that an octave both expands and contracts withinitself. As any plant grows (we take plant as a synonym for organism) amutual process of backwards and forwards lines of time if proceeding.This enables us to produce the forward-backward enneagram shown inthe diagram. You will need time to assimilate these ideas. Examine thediagrams and explanations carefully, meditating on them where neces-sary.The Smashing of ConditioningAccept your feelings (emotional and physical). Allow them to penetrateyour head.

The more tense youare, and the more obstacles, the less 'alive' you feel.ConditioningImitation of parents and others on a subliminal level is frequentlythe root of conditioning, as we discussed under 'Mantra'. If you experi-ment with this you may notice, for example, that one word or gesturewill swiftly reverberate around a room. This is the basis for muchhypnosis. Conditioning moves from the intellectual to the physical levelvery swiftly. Once structured in muscles the psychic knot is 'forgotten'.The 'Awakened' state is often taken by occultists to refer only tosome nebulous transcendental realm. This most certainly is not ourview. We mean it on an ordinary level - in the here and now.The RidgepoleThis expression of the I Ching reveals the dynamic Magick ofAMOOKOS. The Ridgepole is the fluid yet equipoised point existingbetween the two states of active/passive. The head is 'heaven', theEarth is at the feet.

Such which has passed intothe hands of the orthodox as been twisted out of context and has lost itsmeaning. But in the symbolism or iconography much of real occultvalue can still be discerned by the awake-aware.As an example, in this section, we will discuss the hidden symbol-ism of the well-known God known as Ganapati or Ganesha. In present-day Hinduism Ganesha has degenerated into a God stopping obstacles,and His image can often be seen in shops. The shopkeepers 'worship'Him for the success of their trade.If we look at a contemporary image of Ganesha, the iconographyhas preserved much of the occult or esoteric side, although the exotericside has triumphed. We see a strange composite of elephant and man,and at the bottom of the picture a mouse or rat.This is a glyph of the three worlds - of heaven, earth and theunderworld, or sun, moon and fire. But in a very clever and wise waythe symbolism has been drawn from the animal or mammal kingdom.In this picture man is the mean between the large or macrocosm andsmall or microcosmos.Because of this triple sym-bolism Ganesha is connected withthree gunas. His association with'obstacles' comes from the greatstrength of the elephant, the in-telligence of the human and thesubtlety or ability to penetratesmall spaces of the mouse or rat.Ganesha is usually shownwith four arms - these representthe four directions of space or thefour elements - the God being thespirit or quintessence of these.This is also an indication of howthe four turn into three and thethree into one.Ganesha means Lord ofHosts. As is usual in the Tantriksymbolism the Name is really anadjective. This adjective is alsoapplied to Shiva. The Hosts arethe hosts of spirits or denizens of"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Tantra MagickCraftsmen and Craftswomenthe three worlds.Although Ganesh is usually thought of as the son of Shiva andParvati, the more cosmic view is that He is, simply, a specialised aspector symbol of the primordial God. Because we follow nature, it is entirelynatural that Primordial Godhead is represented by the penis, while theGoddess is shown by the yoni.Knowledgeable about the creation of a child, the ancients, knowingof macro and microcosmos, found it natural to conceive of the sexualunion of a woman and man as analogous to the creation of the cosmos.You will not be surprised to learn that there formerly existed anesoteric group of Ganesha worshipers who worshipped the GaneshaLingam and his Shakti as creators of our cosmos.Contemporary images of the elephant-headed God invariablyshow Him clothed. Formerly this was not the case. We can note thefollowing prescriptions for images drawn from a medieval and occultIndian work:-Ganesha: Vermillion colour, three eyes with a large belly. In Hisfour hands he holds a tusk, a noose, a goad and grants boons. He holdsin His trunk a pomegranate and a crescent moon is on his forehead. Heis adorned with huge serpents.The symbolism relating Ganesh as being a child of Shiva andParvati also has meaning. Their other son is Skanda or Kartikeya. Herides a peacock. If we take Shiva as guru, His sons, one with him inspiritual lineage, are the Divine and the Heroic dispositions. Ganeshaand Skanda are princes and Shiva is the king.The Ganesha UpanishadWe would ask you to examine this in the light that it is a resume of occultor magickal lore. Think about it with an open mind and analyse it forwhat it is.We do not, in these papers, wish to restrict ourselves to theoccultism of the Indian subcontinent. The gods and goddesses of manyplaces and traditions can reveal a wealth of material which can expandour understanding. Occult symbols or sages can often preserve a wholebody of wisdom and yoga magick. Some of this has been corrupted orgarbled through the course of time by the ignorant. But the wise can re-construct the past into the present for projection into the future.Ganapatl UpanishadAuspicious-ness to those who hear - thus the Shanti.1 Om Lam I bow to Ganapati.2 You clearly are the tattva.

Many problems arise because of mutual interpenetration. A daydreamis an example of this, as is performing a whole series of complex actionswithout being aware of any of them.In our dreams, wake state can exist. Usually we recall fragmentsthe next morning when we awake. These fragments may contain hintsof previous day's activities, of things which have happened when wewere dream-awake, (mad association) or deepsleep - awake.If you are interested in working with these fragments, the books ofDr Ann Faraday may prove useful to you. But it is possible to get boggeddown in the world of 'Dream Power' or the mad pursuit of luciddreams.Members should carry out their own experiments with dreamsand states of consciousness. As there are many levels to this work, andit is best carried out on a personal basis, we have not included it as aformal part of the curriculum. But you are strongly recommended toincorporate elements into your own work.A Tantrik View of ConsciousnessPeople commonly experience three states: Being awake (Jagrat),dreaming (Svapna), and deep sleep (Sushupti). But the fourth state,Awake Awareness (Turiya) is not usually considered by ordinaryscience.All of these states interpenetrate each other. A daydream isSvapna in Jagrat. A lucid dream is Jagrat in Svapna. Other subdivisionsexist, and can be explored. One of the aims of AMOOKOS is to givemembers experience of the fourth state in each of the other three states.Dream RecordKeep a separate diary by your bed. Use a biro or pencil to recorddreams. Include the date, time, and the place of the record. Note yourdreams first thing in the morning, immediately on wakening. At firstyou may find this hard to do, and there will be days when you recordnothing, but persevere. Note fragments of dreams, however bizarre andapparently unconnected. Meditate on your dreams in the umbra Zonule.Dreams as a guide to ConditioningDream content often contains references to the previous day'sevents. These may show inner reactions to people, events, and evenhealth. They are a great guide to discovering conditioning. The key todream symbolism is often conundrum, ambiguity, and puns. This innercode is unique for everyone.Senoi TribeThis group of people incorporated dreams into their world-view.In the morning, family members shared their dreams. If someone met ahostile entity in a dream, she or he had to subdue it, and force it to givea dream gift to bring back into everyday life. The gift had to besomething useful or aesthetically pleasing. The Senois seemed to regardhostile dream elements as split off parts of their own selves. Attemptthis technique with your own dreams. Resist the temptation to interpretdream characters as being \"outside\" yourself. Dream friends should becultivated. Dream animals like lions and tigers might represent latentpowers. Before sleeping, ask for a specific dream on a specific point —perhaps some split or confusion you've been unable to resolve in eitherthe umbra Zonule or in ordinary life. The tantrik goddess of dreams isSvapnavati Devi (She who goes in sleep).Lucid DreamingLucid dreams can be triggered mechanically by biofeedback meth-ods.

Try andkeep records of these as well.Siddhis - magickal powers : an inner viewAstral Projection, the idea that human beings have a subtle bodyattached to the physical one is very ancient and common to manydifferent cultures.Astral Projection and the body's NadisThis is work of the Nadi Chakra. The nadis in the body are the conduitsof vital energy or prana. There is a shakti called Pranashakti. Her Yantrais the nadi network in the body. Before being able to withdraw thesenadis it is necessary to be aware of Pranashakti within your own body.These manifest as currents which can very definitely be felt physically.Their action hinges on breath being 21600 (ie the number of breaths inone day and one night).The radiance or luminosity of Pranashakti extends a few inchesbeyond the body. Pranashakti is one with Nada (Sound in itself). Whenshe is withdrawn, at first one's outer extremities become cold. One mayfeel slight breezes seeming to move over your limbs. Then the bodybecomes or feels as if it is paralysed. As Pranashakti merges with NadaShakti a feeling of vibration commences until a stage is reached wherethis involving Pranashakti becomes sound. At this stage Nasikashaktimay manifest.This Nasika is a zig-zag phenomenon accompanied by strongemotional and physical feelings and perhaps inner sound moving fromone side of the back to the other. This is often confused with so-calledKundalini - but recall that this term is loosely and incorrectly used by theuninitiated.When all Prana has withdrawn into Nada, exit is made via thecrown of the head. This process described in full here is exactly analo-gous to the death process. It is not easy to become proficient in thismethod, and indeed if you have equilibriated your three shaktis withinyour body it is even harder. Remember it is only possible to withdrawPranashakti when you are fully aware of how to extend Her - in otherwords, when you have experienced or had sexual intercourse with Her.The difficulty with attempting astral projection before one hasstabilized one's nadi web is that the withdrawn energy can cross intoareas which have not been stabilised.An old Shaivite tradition gives a clue to a sound occult basis for thedifferent 'bodies'.BINDU BLISS\"BODY\"  SOUND IN ITSELFNADA KNOWLEDGE \"BODY\" THE 4THMOON IMPRESSION \"BODY\" BRAINSUN BREATH \"BODY\" HEARTFIRE FOOD \"BODY\" GENITALSA mantra and a human body have these components. Althoughthese five elements are shown 'above' each other, the truth is that theyare omni-pervading. How to realise in oneself Nada or sound in itself,this is enigma. The axis for the three centres of Moon, Sun and Fire, isBindu, its axis is Nada.The Astral Body is taken as the old idea of a body attached to thephysical form by a thin cord is the breath body.

Treat suchclaims with scepticism. Each siddhi is a very great thing and much rarerthan most people would have you believe. Achievement implies a levelof being of greatness.Abandon the idea that every one is capable of progressing inmatters of yoga magick.

But devoidof will as 98% of people are, this can only be a delusion.Food (our physical body) can be well or badly cooked. Qualityvaries from cook to cook. Being is the cohesive elixir which we arelooking for. Devoid of spiritual being, people are mere beasts (pashus)and less than animals, which are at least true to their own natures.Another point useful to remember is that you will know foryourself your own powers, but others will not (and indeed cannot)usually recognise them, other than by reacting to you in different ways,but usually unconsciously.Do not neglect the fact that you have a wealth of so-called ordinarypower which is mostly unused.

Her Guru linenumbers amongst its members both Matsyendranath and Gorakhnath.She is the Shakti of Time. Time itself is Shri Mahakali, and Her spouseor alpha ovule is Shri Mahakala Bhairava, at once beyond and one withTime.Time is viewed as terrible because its inexorable process consumesthe cosmos. From Mahakali emerges a cluster of lesser Shaktis which areher Shaktis of Creation, Maintenance and Destruction. These are theyoginis and Door Protectors of the Body Yantra.Sometimes shown at the centre of the Kali Yantra are five triangles,each point of which represents one of her most intimate forms known asNityas, a word meaning 'eternity' or 'day7. These days are the waningdigits of the Moon.Kali, like many other great Vidyas, is a complete cosmos withinHerself, and 'astrology' is the key to understanding Her symbolism.

Their sexual unionsymbolises that which unites them, ie their child or earth. Because thishas the property of reconciling Kali and Kala it is linked to the GunaSattva. Moon is Tamas and Sun is Rajas. All these factors are inter-changeable.Both Sun and Moon have four modes or Kulas which correspondto the four elements Earth, Air, Fire and Water. Earth too has fourmodes. In the case of the Sun the modes are known as Mercury, Jupiter,Venus and Mars. The Moon's Kulas are Pluto, Saturn, Uranus andNeptune. These are therefore subdivisions or Kulas or clusters of ShivaShakti.If we take each of these four as engaging in sexual intercourse theyproduce:Shakti + Shiva = ChildPluto + Mercury = AirSaturn + Jupiter = EarthUranus + Venus = WaterNeptune + Mars = FireMoon + Sun = AetherThese are Kali's fifteen Nityas, and the digits (Kalas) of the waningmoon: Full Moon (Sun), Mars, Fire, Neptune, Uranus, Water, Venus,Akasha, Saturn, Earth, Jupiter, Mercury, Air, Pluto, New Moon (Moon)Mahakali is therefore unified time, or the collectivity of all HerKulas or Yoginis. One is already liberated - the Alpha Ovule. The trickis to 'rearrange' the kulas so that (1) both time and its power becomesapparent to you and others according to one's Will, and (2) that onerealises oneself as source and expression of Time.Basis of TimeNumber, that is to say the interplay of Shiva and Shakti, is the basis ofTime. The whole circle of Zodiakos with the planets, sidereal constella-tions, angles and Navamshas is Mahakali Herself.The lesser subdivisions of Time come into play as a result of thereblending of the lesser Kulas with the greater Kulas. In a time breathchart there are two great realms which are reconciled in a human being,taken as a symbol of Sun/Moon or Shiva/Shakti perfect assimilation:108Realm 1 Realm 2Kala (Sun) Kali (moon)12 Kalas 15 KalasA microcosm is defined as the blending of the 12 Kalas of the Sunand the fifteen kalas of the Moon. Both sets of Kalas are again made upof the sexual union of Shiva and Shakti in various proportions. Amicrocosm is therefore sometimes called a 27, whereas a Macrocosm isa 108.This mutual blending of the Sun and Moon or Shiva-Shakti isrepresented in the Shri Yantra in a unified way by the 5 downwardpointing triangles (5x3), and four Upward pointing triangles (4x3).Time and its unitsThe basis of Time in Tantrika conception is breath. This is because it is themean unit of the whole cosmos as food. In Ayurveda there is 'food' asfood, 'food' as breath and 'food' as sense impressions. All three typesare consumed at a different rate or vibration.In one day and one night a balanced human being is said to breath21600 times. 10800 are for the night and 10800 for the day. A day and anight is one breath for the Sun. One year is one day for the sun. A lunarfortnight is one breath for the Moon.The basic unit for Zodiakos is also 21600 (minutes of arc). Of these10800 are of Kala and 10800 or Kali. This divides Zodiakos into a Solarand a Lunar half. Within this Wheel of Time there are therefore sixsidereal constellations which are Lunar, and six which are Solar. Thesetwo sets are each divided into a Solar and a Lunar half, and of these twosets of three are made up of a Rajasic (Solar), Tamasic (Lunar) and areconciling component.This gives the fundamental division of the constellations into 12 -the 12 Kalas of the Sun. They are in units of 4.The Time Breath ChartThis individual chart shows how the particular blendings of the 27solunar Kalas affect a being's breathing pattern.Magickal application of the Time Breath ChartA balanced human being breathes 21600 times in day and night. Anunbalanced human breathes haphazardly according to the patternfound in the Time Breath Chart.109"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Tantra MagickThe 27 Hormonal Messengers or DutisThe heart and core of the 27 Kalas is Samarasa beyond Time and Space,modified into 27 various blendings of Sun and Moon. This is theSupreme Hormone.A Time Breath Chart shows a predisposition to one of more of thevarious hormone - Kalas. It is these which are both affected by and affectthe breath, the physical appearance, the muscle structure, armouringsand so forth.The Kaula CircleThis was made of up 8,15, or 27 Shaktis with their Shivas, selectedaccording to the predispositions in their individual TBCs of the variousKalas, the conception being that by assembling these Dutis, Suvasinis orNityas one created on earth a model of Macrocosm.Poison or NectarWhether these messengers act as poison or nectar depends on theirindividual positions in relation to the Wheel of Time at the time of birth.PoisonsThese are configurations which affect a human being on Sun, Moon andFire levels to produce psychological disturbances structured in mind,feelings and muscles.Planets as Symbols of the Hormone-DutisBecause the planets or Yogins as a circle within themselves contain allthe elements of the Micro-macrocosm, it is possible to take their effectsas a measure of all other effects occurring in the wheel of time.Nectar or PoisonIf nectar, the planes give beneficial results to the individual in whosechart they are found. If poison, the planet gives detrimental effects.However the significant thing from the point of view of a Nath-Magician is that, whether 'good' or 'bad', the person manifesting themis partial.Chief Nectar is SamarasaThe goal of the magician working with the Kala Chakra is the liberationwithin her of his being of the Maha Amrit or Super Nectar, which givesboth access and birth to all other nectars.Sama ConsciousnessThis is Equipoise, a stale of being in which partial identification with one110Craftsmen and Craftswomenor another thing cannot happen.Kala Chakra Method of MagickThis involves the individual fight against particular identificationsbased on one's own Time Breath Chart and the seeking of Sahaja, Sama,Samarasa based on return to one's source and freedom from action-reaction shown in one's own chart.Uncover the Moon!The most vital magickal aspect of the action of these Kalas of the Moonis that they partake of Maya or seizure, and have power only when amagician is unconsious of them. Because they simultaneously affect thethree levels it is impossible to attack their lawful results using one onlyof mind, body or feelings.Observe others!Because others unconsciously express the effects of the hormonal Shaktis,observation of them in others is the key to uncovering their effects inyou. For example if you see 50 people with Pluto Kala strong and eachmanifests the same hormone or type, and if you yourself know that youhave Pluto Kala strong it is reasonable to presume that you also may beunconsciously expressing Pluto Kala. This gives you a strong basis forworking.Shaktis themselves oppose Kalachakra MagickBecause the Kulas have as their function the covering or englamouringof their own Shiva consciousness they oppose the process.Heroines and HeroesYou must be heroic if you venture far on this path of tantra as everythingin you and much outside opposes the work. Therefore make a strongresolution to carry things through.Yogas in KalachakraAny place where on Kala in a Time Breath Chart is connected with anyother Kala or Kalas is a yoga or union of two hormonal factors.Final ConclusionReread Tantrik Astrology.

Siddhiemanating from one's own being arises from liberation. The fiveobjects of the senses constitute the expanded Cosmos. Of all thisKnowledge is the Essence. Yoga is liberation.The absolute without parts (Adharma) is the Creator. Ignorance isthe same as knowledge. Ishvara, the Lord is the Cosmos. The eternalis the same as the transitory. Knowledge is identical with theabsence of knowledge. Adharma is Dharma. This is liberation. Thefive bonds constitute the essence of real knowlege. The Pinda is theproducer (of all). In that is liberation.This is real knowlege. Of all the sense the eye is the chief. One shouldbehave in a way opposite to that expected. One should not do thisdevoid of Tightness. All this is the essence of Shambhavi.The amnya not to be found in knowledge. Guru is oneness. All isoneness within the mind. Siddhi does not exist in uninitiated ones.Abandon pride and so forth.One should not reveal this. One should not discuss this withpashus. Even weak argument may contain the truth. One shouldnot make distinctions. Do not speak of the secret of self. One mayspeak of it to a pupil.Within a Shakta, outwardly a Shaiva, in the world a Vaishnava.This is the rule. Liberation comes from knowledge of self.Condemn not others such as Adhyatmika. Do not perform vows.Do not establish oneself on restraint. Binding oneself is notliberation, a Kaula should not practice outwardly. One becomesequal to All. One becomes liberated.One may read these sutras at sunrise. One attains the siddhi ofknowledge. This is the knowledge of Self, or Parameshvari.May the Kaula triumph!Om shanti shanti shanti.The Kaula Upanishad is complete.112113"}]
