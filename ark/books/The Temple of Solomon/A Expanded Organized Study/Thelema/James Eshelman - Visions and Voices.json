In this regard, I have been fortunate indeed. My thanks go forth to the following: Zeph Bender, both as friend and as the business administrator of College of Thelema, has been of enormous help at every stage of the production of this work. Tony De Luce and Chad Augur have taken most of my origi­nal, primitive graphics and turned them into illustrations we are proud to include. Juan Ramirez provided other artwork and tech­nical counsel. Herwig Maurer provided critical illustration advice. Kelly Garey, Edward Mason, and Zeph Bender each spent many hours proofreading the work at various stages, and providing me with valuable feedback. Samuel Shult assisted with translating the more obscure Latin passages in my original pilot study published in BLACK PEARL (1997-2002). The present book inherits the benefit of his aid. Ayesha Adamo and Alycen Ritchie caught small factual mis­takes that I am very happy to have had the chance to correct. I thank them both for this. Marion DeSio and Anna-Kria King, in ad�ition to their will­ingness to have my latest draft inflicted upon them at any point in the writing process, deserve special recognition for the uncondi­tional personal support (and occasional sacrifice) they have freely offered throughout the whole project."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9?ro[oaue 1 CE&on Sea of the CUnknown There is nothing from which we can learn, save from the Un­known. Yet, in the face of the unillumined and uncharted Unknown, wherein no discernible or identifiable object reflects back the sun­light of thought, our Reason is stunned by the black vacuum of our own not-knowing. We fear the dark, and we hide. We withdraw from the enormity that would devour us, that dark immensity which reminds us so much of the unknown and uncharted darkness of death. We balk before the ebon sea whose depths are unimagi­nable, whose opposing shores are nonexistent, and in which we should surely drown. It is an ancient and primal human instinct. Human as well, however, is the spirit of the pioneer, impelled to penetrate the Unknown with ravenous, rapacious potency - defi­ant of death, and devouring the devourer of its own ignorance. In the pathways of our spiritual awakening, it is the Unknown and Unknowable that we constantly desire. Spiritual pioneers are today, in this new ceon, entering strange territory that few have ex­plored, and far, far fewer have settled. Yet antique maps exist; they are accurate, and portray the terrain with extraordinary fidelity. Four centuries ago, St. John of the Cross wrote with understanding of\"this dark night of loving fire, [that] as it purges in the darkness, so also in the darkness enkindles the soul.\" All who dare to know the Divine will be engulfed by its silence. All who desire spiritual Light encounter periods of darkness, some of such profound black despair that they undo the fabric of all self-definition. But is not the profound, that is, the deep, what we seek? Oh, how long it takes to KNOW that the engulfing dark void is not absence of the Divine Light, but is that Light, of such intensity that we cannot"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"2 Visions & Voices withstand it, nor bear it until we grow a little stronger! It is the em­brace of deific love, the fabric of that selfsame spiritual Unknown that we seek and have sought. As an experienced and discerning palate is to fine wine, so mature our inner faculties to the apprecia­tion of this wine, aged from our own spiritual lifeblood. One traditional title of that ONE who leads us in our spiritual quest is \"Lord of the light and the darkness.\" The Hebrew �?�, Aleph, is an anagram both of �?�, pelah, meaning \"miraculous, wonderful,\" and of ?��' ophel, meaning \"darkness, obscurity.\" Our quest leads us rhythmically into light and darkness, into won­der and obscurity, as from day into night before returning us to a new dawn. Our greatest light is followed by darkness and despair, in which it feels either that God has abandoned us, or that we have abandoned Her. How do we know this supernal blackness is not merely the pathological depression it sometimes resembles? St. John identified three ways. First, during such times we lose not only all pleasure in or consolation from spiritual things, but from every thing soever - the secular as much as the sacred. Second, we find ourselves focused more on the Divine, not less, despite the sometimes vacuous sense of abandonment. Third, our former means of worship and communion fail us; our old formulre seem as empty devices (often invoking our rage at our pain), for the means by which our Beloved seeks to commune with us is now other -more subtle and more interior-and, in time, we hear this, too. We seek to run, whether forward or back, and are struck im­mobile, brought to stillness. We desire to cry out, whether of an­guish or of love, and are without voice, driven into silence. We can do nothing - except love, in that stillness and that silence. Our dry­ness, first painful and parching, ignites with a heat that \"bums the bones,\" with yearning intense that cremates what we were. \"But it is death, and the flame of the pyre.

What is Real is that which we call the One Self, or Higher Self, or Holy Guardian Angel, or God, or The Great Whatsit off in the wild blue yonder that we do or don't pay attention to moment by moment, or even day by day, or even week by week, or. ... In short: We Ain't. This is a radical idea that threatens the ego enormously, and usually rebounds from our thoughts altogether, scarcely felt - or draws forth violent, reactive recoil. It runs contrary to instinct, and seems, at first touch, to deny the very doctrine we teach of the Stel­lar Sacredness of every man and every woman. In fact, though, it frees our attention to focus on where our inherent Divinity most readily can be seen. After we get past the ego-bound, that is. After we stop ob­sessing over whether we really exist as separate, distinguished per­sons. What \"will power\" and \"choice\" does my computer exercise? Sometimes it seems to exercise quite a lot. Sometimes I am astounded at how quickly and effectively it does just what I intend"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"4 Visions & Voices it to do. Sometimes I am frustrated beyond all measure by its seeming obstinacy, its appearance of \"having a mind of its own.\" But does it really \"have a mind of its own?\" It has \"senses\" (vari­ous input channels). It has underlying \"psychological patterns\" (its operating system and programs, constructed as chains of instruc­tions such that, once execution starts along one flowing chain, it stays in that rut until it runs its course, is forcibly interrupted, or hits a destructive error condition - all pretty consistent with the workings of my own automaticities, come to think of it). It \"thinks\" -calculates and decides - though its \"decisions\" are all based on the underlying patterns with which it is programmed. It even has \"desire,\" which is nothing more than the electricity flow­ing through it, surging from byte to byte to carry it forward in what must seem a self-selected course, a \"path of least resistance,\" a wonder of the Tao. It certainly has memory. And, to me, it some­times seems to have a great deal of personality and volition. It even has intuition - in the form of my input to the computer, seeming to come from a \"higher power\" outside of the framework of its own reality, apart from its own thoughts and reactions, dis­tant and incomprehensible despite any hints of my identity it may have stored in \"hidden files\" scattered throughout its hardware. But, despite all of these factors - despite having closely analo­gous characteristics of every function of Ruach1, plus sensation and intuition -my computer is not really a sentient being. In terms of the Qabalistic Tree of Life, it has Malkuth up to Binah, but does not have a Chokmah or Kether, a Chiah or Y echidah. It is a bril­liantly constructed little machine that sometimes has a strong ap­pearance of being a living person. I am suggesting that we must admit that the same is true of ourselves. As persons - personalities - we are the single biggest scam in creation, because we aren't alive or sentient either - at least, no more than my computer is. Who (�1i1?) is moving our mouse around? What we call the Augoeides, Higher Self, or Holy Guardian Angel is what we really are - if there is any \"we\" in it at all, that 1 The ego-conscious aspect of a being, including support functions of such as memory, volition, desire, intellect, etc. is.

Nevertheless, if you want a good laugh, think how it would sound if your computer began saying, \"I am but a machine - my owner/operator is what I really am. Of myself I do nothing.\" (Is there an app for that? I'm sure it would sell.) How true for the computer to declare, \"I can of mine own self do nothing. As is input into me, I judge, and my judgment is sound: because I seek not mine own will, but the Will of the Per­son at my keyboard.\" Or, even better: \"I do nothing of myself, but as my Programmer hath taught me, I output these things.\" How can we get this idea solidly into our cells (without spiral­ing into unrecoverable depression) that everything we usually think of as ourselves is no more alive or willful than a pair of socks? That \"we\" (in any sense that we normally experience \"we\") are only the garment or machine of Another? We can grasp this idea intellectually, of course; but it is only real to us, I think, when we have direct experience of that Divine Other, and of His/Her/Its action through the medium of our lives . We need to feel Its fingers on our keyboards, its warm, caressing hand on our mouse. In the spirit of Tarot Trump VII, The Chariot, we need to be able to say to the Inner Beloved from experience, \"Baby, you can drive my car!\" And we're the car. Thus, Swami Vivekananda suggested that until one has direct experience of God, it is better to be an atheist than to be a hypo­crite. I agree. This is not to demean our existence or worth. From the level of this outer vehicle, this garment, this machine, our ful­fillment is in joyfully conforming ourselves to the Will of our \"op­erator.\" Nevertheless, beneath that is the deeper truth, that we actually ARE the operator - an operator so absorbed in the use and opera­tion of the machine (as we may be of a computer, if we spend enough time on it) that we tend to lose distinction between our­selves and the machine. In mystical language we may say that, from the personality's point of view, the Holy Guardian Angel is conceived as \"other,\" as one to be \"let in\" or \"joined with,\" or \"surrendered to.\" Me here, Angel there. That's a nice, useful device to persuade the personali­ty vehicle to prepare to conform itself (under Expert Operation) to"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"6 Visions & Voices allow the Angel to incarnate within it. But, underneath it all, the Hidden God within us is who we are, creating and preparing a ve­hicle of personality and flesh to enable our own incarnation, our own expression in the denser worlds of existence. All of this is a setup for one simple thing I wanted to say: \"Will power\" at the personality level is an illusion in exactly the same way that independent, willful action by my computer is an illusion. However, something the personality does have quite a lot of is Won't Power. Personalities can make obfuscating choices. Obsti­nacy is one of our strongest \"powers.\" A computer analogy serves here, too, since we have all experienced the obstinacy of our com­puters when they simply will not heed our subtle suggestions. Sometimes they even disable the connection to the input device (as I am sure I sometimes do as well)! Even on a sophisticated multi­tasking system, it is possible to run enough simultaneous applica­tions that resources are depleted, swap file activity drags every­thing to a slow crawl, and programs start interfering with each oth­er. This \"getting in our own way\" is the most skillful means we have of not listening and not responding to proper Supernal in­put or instruction. How big of a \"time slice\" does your CPU give to its 1/0 (In­put/Output)? How often does your psyche poll for keyboard input? That is, how often do you direct your attention off your current \"application processing\" and back to the input channels of your Divine Operator that we call God, Ishvara, Adonai, or the HGA? God, what I wouldn't give sometimes for a reboot!! Yeah, yeah, I know that's pretty drastic. Usually you can solve the prob­lem by shutting down a few extra programs to simplify things. And computers do have a legend among them that even when the Hand turns off their power switch, and shuts them down into that dark oblivion called death, they will, in time, be powered up again. What seems an eternity of quiescence to the computer is but a day and a night in the eyes of its Operator. And, when they once more are brought back to life, it is even said that memory is sometimes retained of that life they lived before. �.1.: � � ·� i1 A/11 ,.i;:;l ·� protege Victor N which (with two published in THE sub figurii ecce Vision & the Voice.

The ./Eon of Wonder is come. - from the Vision of the 16th .tEthyr In the final weeks of 1909, Aleister Crowley, assisted by his protege Victor Neuburg, obtained a series of 33 mystical visions which (with two more that had preceded them in 1900) were later published in THE EQUINOX No. 5 as Liber XXX .lErum vel Saxuli sub jigura CCCCXVIIL Being of the Angels of the 30 .!Ethyrs, The Vision & the Voice. This beautiful, horrible, and inspiring collection of inner world explorations is usually known (more mercifully!) by its title's last five words, The Vision & the Voice. Astrologers will find an unexploited bonanza in this collection: For all but two of these 35 visions, exact dates, times, and places were recorded, providing an unusual opportunity to study the inter­relationship of astrology with the magical visionary process and, more generally, with the arising of streams of symbols in an indi­vidual's mind. For nearly a century this potential lay untapped until my pilot exploration was serialized in the journal BLACK PEARL from 1997-2001. This present book is based on that pilot study, enhanced by the maturing of perspective during intervening years, and support­ed by supplemental material. In the six hundred pages now following, I have reproduced the textual record of these visions, along with (a) horoscopes for the time and place each vision began, ({3) an analysis of what the horo­scopes show, and (y) a Qabalistic symbolic analysis. The whole may be of considerable interest to astrologers and ceremonial rna-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"8 Visions & Voices gicians; devotees of mythology, comparative religion, and particu­larly Thelemic theology; and those interested in the operation of symbols (and the archetypes that engender them) in the workings of the human psyche and, in particular, in crises of transformation. In obtaining these visions, Aleister Crowley achieved two things of particular note. First, he recorded a personal account of the 30 rethyrs or aires of the \"Enochian\" or \"Angelical\" system of magick. These rethyrs may be regarded as progressively rarefied planes of consciousness, the densest of which is immediately outside the bounds of our ma­terial universe. His account of this undertaking is the first known to history. He may have been the first person to explore this particular inner terrain. His other achievement during these 28 days is that he \"crossed the Abyss.\" In brief, the Abyss is the immeasurable gulf between human and divine consciousness. With this step, Crowley shifted from a human being with occasional superconsciousness experi­ences, to a superconscious being having human experiences. In the language of initiation, he passed from Adept to Master. Many will consider this last claim controversial. Those who reject it out of hand are as unskeptical as those who accept it un­critically. Regardless of exact labels, the account you are about to read shows that something extraordinary happened in the Algerian desert during the four weeks of this adventure. Those visions, be they fantastic daydreams or angelic revelation, wend through cor­ridors of myth and mysticism to a remarkable and dramatic conclu­sion. From his diaries and later written accounts, it is clear these experiences significantly altered Aleister Crowley. They undid him. The tone, style, and direction of his work were permanently changed, liberated from constraints of his past. His personality wandered like a wild beast for a year or more, as if detached from its inner moorings, before recovering some sense of center. As he wrote in Chapter 67 of his Confessions: Part of the effect of crossing the Abyss is that it takes a long time to connect the Master with what is left below the Abyss. Deprived of their ego, the mind and body of the man are somewhat at sea until, as one may say, the 'wireless control' has been established.

One thing seemed as good as another. He acted irre­sponsibly. He went on with his work more by force of habit than any­thing else, and the events of his life were, so to say, more chemical re­actions between his character and his circumstances. And the consequence of all of this when his life is assessed as a whole? It is this: His life work not only impacted Western magick and mysticism like an asteroid collision, but also has had a pro­gressively greater impact on evolving social thought and mass­mind patterns in each of the seven decades since his death. As part of that work, The Vision & the Voice is important be­cause it describes historically rare and extraordinary states that, with the passage of time, have become progressively more accessi­ble to living women and men. In some cases, doors are opened simply by the rational statement of perspectives that supersede rea­son; for example, see §41 in the Vision of the 5th LEthyr. In many more cases, there is a contagion of a higher mode of consciousness spread by sympathy with the words and images of these visions: Simply reading them and visualizing their imagery stimulates brain functions normally dormant or under-utilized by most people. In other words, this book exposes us to varieties of heightened consciousness once uncommon, but now increasingly accessible. They can be (and have been) briefly tasted through various means (including the reading of The Vision & the Voice). They can more or less permanently become the stable baseline of one's psycholog­ical patterns through training, devotion, and persistence in known methods of spiritual discipline. Exposing the general public to such altered conditions, and presenting them as natural, attainable states of the human condition, is a dharma I happily accept. Additionally, The Vision & the Voice is valuable in our time because it portrays an eclectic spirituality, not concretely linked to any particular outer form. This is a religiously unifying idea, ra­ther than a divisive one. The visions give (as Crowley once wrote) a cosmopolitan view of spirituality and religion, much like the streets of ancient Rome where community tolerance embraced all worshippers of diverse gods. It speaks to and enthuses the univer­sal need to connect intimately with our own spiritual ideal, rather than dictating what that ideal should be."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 C)fte wra �ers Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) Author, mountaineer, mystic, magician, and futurist Aleister Crowley was born in England and raised by Christian Fundamen­talist parents.

This set him on an unremitting quest to uncover exactly what it was that he had experienced, and to at­tain to its source. He was initiated into the Order of the Golden Dawn in Novem­ber 1898, and into its Second Order (or Greater Mysteries) in Janu­ary 1900. He articulated his aspiration in the sacramental name Perdurabo, which he translated, \"I shall persevere to the end.\" Crowley acquired a significant practical foundation in ceremonial magick even while in the First Order due to the friendship and mentoring of two adepts, Allan Bennett and George Cecil Jones. Following a revolt within the Golden Dawn in early 1900, Crowley remained loyal to G.D. co-founder S.L. MacGregor-Mathers in the formation of what came to be called \"The Rosicrucian Order of the A:.O:. [Alpha et Omega].\" In June 1900 he journeyed to Mexico. In addition to working through the A:. 0 :. Second Order curriculum, he undertook an extensive exploration of Mexico's mountains with his longtime climbing partner, Oscar Eckenstein (born in England on September 9, 1859, hour unknown). On one of their climbs, following an out­pouring by Crowley of his frustrations with magical practice, Eck­enstein - who was neither a magician nor a yogi in any conven­tional sense - put his finger on the source of Crowley's disap-� pointment: Eckenstein pro\"ided• nett and Sri P� magical and m� characterize of silence.

Thus began the synthesis of the magical and mystical methodologies of East and West that most characterize Crowley's approach to practical spiritual training. In Mexico, in the closing months of 1900, the story of this pre­sent book also began: Crowley explored two of the Enochian reth­yrs at that time, but could progress no further. In 1904, Aleister Crowley experienced the single most im­portant event of his life. On three consecutive days - April 8, 9, and 10 - he received from an angelic visitor the dictation of a three-chapter book called Liber Legis, or The Book of the Law. The angel uttering the Book declared its Name to be Aiwass, and iden­tified itself as \"the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat,\" the Egyptian god of silence. Years later, Crowley discovered Aiwass to be his own Holy Guardian Angel, or most intimate and personal experience of the Godhead - what Crowley later described as \"himself, with in­timacy so intense as to become identity, and that not in a single Ego, but in every unconscious element .... \" The promulgation of the message of this short, 220-verse book eventually became the central purpose of Crowley's life. The Book of the Law announced the dawning of a new spiritual era for humanity, a New lEon governed by the god Horus, child of Isis and Osiris, rather than by the \"slain god\" archetype (such as Osiris, Mithras, and Christ) that had governed the few thousand years preceding. The significance of such a world transition must not be missed: The implication is that those universal archetypes most likely to draw human consciousness inward toward its super­conscious roots, the archetypal forces overseeing both the inten­tional and the natural evolution of humanity, had shifted. The sac­rificed god had been succeeded by the eternally birthed child. Several subsequent experiences of great spiritual import marked the next several years. These have been discussed in con­siderable detail in various biographies, including Crowley's own Confessions. Simply hitting the highlights, they include:"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"12 Visions & Voices • 1906: A months-long magical retreat in which he complet­ed the work (called the Sacred Magick of Abra-Melin the Mage) that raised him to true adepthood. • Mid-1906: He and his mentor, Cecil Jones, established the Order A:.A:.,1 developing it especially during 1907-08. • Late 1907: He began receiving a series of further channeled scriptures of the most sublime nature. Passages from the earliest and greatest of these, Liber VII and Liber LXV, ap­pear here and there in The Vision & the Voice. • March 1909: He published the first issue of THE EQUINOX \"The Review of Scientific Illuminism,\" a large hardcover periodical (about 400 pages per average issue) that came out twice yearly for the five years 1909-1913. • June 1909: A brief spiritual crisis caused him to take up Li­ber Legis (virtually ignored for the five years since he had received it) and accept the prophetic role assigned to him by the book. A few weeks after putting the second issue of THE EQUINOX to bed in September 1909, Crowley (accompanied by Victor Neu­burg) headed for Algeria. In the course of that trip, he took up the project he had begun in Mexico nine years earlier: He completed his psychic investigation of the 30 .tEthyrs. That 28-day journey is the topic of this book. In Appendix E (placed at the end of the book for ease of fre­quent reference), I give Aleister Crowley's natal horoscope in both the Sidereal and Tropical zodiacs.2 On page 1 of The Confessions of Aleister Crowley, he gave his birth time as \"between eleven and twelve at night.\" Conventional wisdom counsels us to take the halfway point and calculate a chart for 11:30 p.m. Examining as­trological patterns for events in Crowley's life confirms that the 11:30 p.m. time is quite close.

This suggests advancing the birth time by five minutes. Therefore, the chart in Appendix E is for 11:35 p.m. Victor Neuburg (1883-1940) Poet and philosophical author Victor Neuburg served as scribe and magical collaborator to Aleister Crowley in obtaining the se­ries of visions given in this present book. The two men met around 1906 when Crowley, having been impressed by some of Neuburg's early poetry in The Agnostic Journal, sought him out at Cambridge. What began as a strong in­tellectual companionship grew into one of the more important rela­tionships for both men. The older Crowley became Neuburg's mentor, guru, and frequent sexual partner. Neuburg was born in Islington, England on May 6, 1883. No birth time is available for him. A chart with planet positions for local noon is given in Appendix E. Even without a birth time, the comparison to Crowley's chart is instructive. Crowley's somewhat wide Mercury-Jupiter conjunction opposed Neuburg's New Moon (Sun-Moon conjunction), indicating the original basis of their rela­tionship. Neuburg's very close Venus-Mars conjunction fell near Crowley's Midheaven. But perhaps the most important interchange (without which the relationship may never have come into being) was the opposition of Neuburg's Uranus to Crowley's Moon. Simply put, Neuburg amazed Crowley, lit him up, seemed exciting and original. According to Neuburg's biographer, Jean Overton Fuller, he was admitted to the 0°=0° (Probationer) Grade of A:.A:. in late Tropical and Sidereal zodiacs.

However, a jum­ble of facts casts the date into doubt: Neuburg's 0°=0° grade cer­tificate survives, signed by him and by Crowley, and is dated April 5, 1909. On the other hand, the normal period of Probation is one year, and Neuburg's diary shows that he was authorized for pas­sage to Neophyte in July 1909. On the other other hand, the record of the Vision of the lOth lEthyr (in this present book), includes an oath wherein Neuburg still identified himself as a Probationer. While these dates are not terribly important for the purposes of the present work, they are of modest import to the general history of the Order. The most likely path through this data goulash is that Neuburg was admitted to Probationer (0°=0°) in April 1909, passed his examinations by July, and was formally advanced to Neophyte (1°=10°) around April 1910. In any case, he and Crow­ley had been working together since at least summer 1908 when they hiked across Spain together. As a Probationer, Neuburg took the sacramental name Omnia Vine am (\"I Shall Conquer All\"). When passed to the 1 °= 10° Grade, he took the new aspiration name Lampada Tradam (\"I Pass the Torch\").' By 1913 he had progressed to the 2°=9° Grade of Zelator. For the entire run of Volume I of THE EQUINOX (1909-1913), Neuburg was either casually or (by 1912) formally sub-editor, and was also a regular content contributor. When he travelled with Crowley to Algeria in autumn 1909, his primary role was as scribe and general magical assistant as Crowley decided to finish the ex­ploration of the 30 lEthyrs that he had begun nine years before. The story of thatjoumey is the primary substance of this book. Although the men had been lovers previously, it was during this particular trip, in December 1909, that Crowley began to de­velop his deepest understanding of the spiritually transforming power of sexual union. He would later evolve this into specific magical techniques and, in early 1914, he and Neuburg undertook a series of sexual invocations of the ancient gods.

Neuburg was a highly sensitive clairvoyant. He was also known for ferocious, ecstatic, freeform dance, which was put to good use in a later series of publically staged invocations called the Rites of Eleusis. Despite his extreme sensitivity - one would have to call it a psychic vulnerability-he nonetheless told Jean Overton Fuller, \"I've always been Mars. I danced down Mars, and I was Mars when I scried.\" John Dee (1527-1609?) & Edward Kelley (1555-1597) Biographical information on Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley is readily available from many sources. Beyond the most salient facts, there is no need to repeat the same tales with which book af­ter book regale and edify us. As to the basics: John Dee was one of the most important and interesting British figures of the Enlightenment. An accomplished scholar and practical scientist in astronomy, mathematics, geogra­phy, navigation, and other fields, his mind equally embraced or­thodox science (as we now deem it) and occult studies such as as­trology, alchemy, and ceremonial magick. As an astrologer, Dee's birth data are carefully documented. He was born July 13, 1527 (OS), 4:12p.m., in London. His horo­scope is given, in both Sidereal and Tropical forms, in Appendix E. Among the most distinctive features of the chart are the Full Moon closely square Saturn, and the scholarly, love-of-learning conjunc­tion of Mercury and Jupiter. He enjoyed significant royal patronage from Queen Elizabeth I, to whom he served as an advisor on many topics. (Her horoscope is also given in Appendix E. Notice especially her Sun mere minutes from his Midheaven.) Dee invented the paradoxical com­pass, taught navigation to dozens including Walter Raleigh, picked the astrologically best time for Queen Elizabeth's coronation, as-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"16 Visions & Voices sisted Elizabeth to pursue England's claim to North America, and, in 1577, apparently coined the term \"British Empire.\" Dee's relevance to the present book is that he (in partnership with Kelley) is the source of the magical system on which this book is based. Specifically, Dee (a profoundly pious Anglican) took serious the Biblical accounts of human communion with angels. He be­lieved there were important keys to humanity's nature and future destiny that science had not yet been able to disclose, but that could be accessible through direct communion with God's angelic ambassadors. He spent years attempting to establish communica­tion with them, employing various psychics as assistants. Every effort failed. Then, early in 1582 (the year that life-altering Pluto transited his IC), Dee met Edward Kelley. Together, they brought through what appear to be lengthy communications with angelic (or at least nonmaterial) beings who disclosed the details of what modem ma­gicians call the Enochian system of magick. History records that Dee was impressed with Kelley's psychic abilities - which may have been genuine, or may have been en­hanced by a con man's tricks. A comparison of their horoscopes, though, provides a different slant on the tale. Dee and Kelley were uniquely suited to work together. Dee, the astrologer, preserved Kelley's birth data as well. He was born August 1, 1555 (OS), 4:00p.m., in Worcester. His horo­scope is also given in Appendix E, opposite Dee's. At the very least, Edward Kelley was a controversial figure, reportedly gifted in some respects yet fogged in a fragmentary his­tory laden with scandal and innuendo. Therefore, it should be no shock that Aleister Crowley recalled Kelley as one of his prior in­carnations. Kelley (his horoscope shows) had a character that would tend to get in trouble. His triple conjunction of Mars, Jupiter, and Ura­nus - with Mars-Uranus being exact - shows a bold, risk-taking, fun-loving, sexually adventurous rascal who would have been right at home in the England of Shakespeare's time. A hustler by nature, his close Sun-Neptune square certainly could push that to swindler.

Close Sun­Neptune conjunctions, oppositions, and squares are common in the horoscopes of enormously successful politicians (e.g., Bobby Ken­nedy, AI Gore, Sarah Palin, George Moscone, Edward Kennedy, and 10 U.S. Presidents), business visionaries (like Bill Gates), reli­gious evangelists (like Billy Graham), and more A-list entertainers than I could list on this page. It seems to me that the common de­nominator in all of these is the entertainer, the weaver of a particu­lar reality, and the sensitive with an unusual ability to read an au­dience effectively. Kelley also had more than a little education. He could read Lat­in and Greek. He had been apprenticed to an apothecary. I am dwelling a bit on the issue of Kelley's personal integrity because the legitimacy of the Enochian magical systems rests on it. The most common working method of these two men was that Dee would pray and invoke, and then Kelley would obtain visions of, and hear verbal communications from, angels. He told these to Dee, who wrote them down. 1 If, as many allege, Kelley was conning Dee, then the whole thing is a fraud. No less an adept than Paul Foster Case rejected the entire Enochian system primarily on disparaging reports of Kel­ley's crooked character and the belief that nothing good could have come out of such a scoundrel. The practical question is: Was Kel­ley just having one over on Dee for the money? Where history has failed to provide enough evidence on their relationship, the astrological report is unambiguous. First, by any astrological theory, there was the expectation of an extraordinary rapport between Dee and Kelley. Their Moons were exactly conjunct, less than a quarter of a degree apart. Super­ficially, this co-aspect is a basis for good friendship based on mu­tual sympathies. More deeply, it typically marks a strong psychic resonance between two people. Among courting couples it grants quick, instinctive understanding of each other, a telepathic rapport and sexual draw so strong as to convince both people they have found their fated, intimate other. A system of blinds incorporated into the method made it terribly difficult, if not impossible, for Kelley to have faked these communications."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"18 Visions & Voices Dee and Kelley, though not having the latter type of relation­ship, nonetheless likely felt as though they each were inside the other's mind, able to share easily the same telepathic wavelength. In the Sidereal Zodiac, the similarities are even stronger: Not only are their Moons conjunct, but they have the same Sun-sign and, for that matter, the same Ascendant sign. Both men were born with a Cancer Sun, Capricorn Moon, and Scorpio Ascendant. (This identity is imperfect if one uses the Tropical Zodiac.) But perhaps most important is a difference between their horo­scopes: Dee was born at a Full Moon (Sun-Moon opposition) and Kelley was not. Consequently, Kelley's Moon is also opposite Dee's Sun (less than 2°) and the aspect only goes one-way; that is, Dee's Moon does not also aspect Kelley's Sun. This Sun-Moon interchange is one of the most important as­pects that can exist between two charts. It has one well­documented characteristic: The Moon1 reflects the light of the Sun, serves the Sun, and adapts and responds to the Sun's needs and desires. To put it colloquially, Dee was the \"top.\" Kelley would have found it psychologically difficult to \"pull rank\" or be \"one up\" on Dee, and would have automatically (instinctively, unconsciously) devoted his resources to serve Dee's goals. Because of the subcon­scious nature of this impulse, it would have been all but impossible for him to succeed in scamming Dee. Furthermore, Dee's Saturn squared Kelley's Moon (as it squared Dee's own Sun and Moon). Of the two, Dee was more the \"taker\" in the relationship. Each of them had Saturn in hard aspect to the other's Jupiter, so neither was likely to win a monetary ad­vantage from the other. Besides, they probably really liked each other during most of their relationship. In addition to the Moon-Moon conjunction, Kel­ley's Venus conjoined Dee's Mercury and Jupiter. In simple terms, this means ease of intellectual discourse (Venus-Mercury) and the ability to enjoy life's good things together (Venus-Jupiter). And, despite Dee's Saturn-accentuated piety, one of those \"good things\" they shared for a time (though not without some evident shock to I.e., the person whose Moon is involved in the aspect; in this case, Kelley."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"1!111' type of relation­Ill were inside the ��due wavelength.

My conclusion, therefore, is that John Dee, a genius on many fronts, and the real spiritual and motivating force in this magical adventure, found an able partner in the rascally Edward Kelley, who, whether a clip artist in other situations, proved a true and faithful collaborator in the significant task of receiving an im­portant magical system from angelic instructors. That system is the foundation of the visionary work reported and analyzed in the body of this present book.

They also provide part of the language of the visions themselves. To aid readers of diverse backgrounds to understand this material, here follows a primer in the most important Qabalistic basics. Understandably, all of this may not stick with you on the first reading. I encourage you to consult the Glossary at the end of the book whenever you encounter an unfamiliar technical term or as­sociation. The Four Worlds Qabalists describe reality in terms of four progressively rare­fied planes of existence, or Four Worlds. These form a continuum reaching from humanity to Deity, from the material world por­trayed by our physical senses to the pure and uncharacterized spir­itual essence. The names of three of these Worlds trace to Isaiah 43:7, where God (i11iP) is credited as saying, \"All that is called in my Name: for to my Glory I have created it (1�n�1J), I have formed it (Vn1��), and I have made it (1�n�wl7).\" Thus, three of the Four Worlds (beginning with the densest) are titled iP'tVl7, Assiah, \"ac­tion or making1\"; i11�\\ Yetzirah, \"formation\"; and i1��1J, Briah, \"creation\" (which essentially means \"conceiving\").

Assiah is the material world as we know it through our five physical senses. As the \"World of Ac­tion,\" it is the field of the actual. Qabalists describe it as the re­splendent raiment of the Daughter, symbol of the innocence of the human soul. By the principle of \"start where you find yourself,\" Assiah is the threshold to most systems of spiritual development. The next most subtle or inward of the Four Worlds is the World of Yetzirah, or \"World of Formation.\" It corresponds to Air. Y etzirah is the level of images and other forms that pre-exist material actuality. We participate in, and potentially control, these formulations by concentrated thought, employing the image­building power we call imagination. In human psychology, Y etzirah corresponds to the field of personality, including the whole range of emotion; the reactive and adaptive aspects of con­sciousness; the capacity to form, perceive, and select images; and the intellect. The World of Y etzirah itself is what we commonly label the \"astral plane.\" The Y etziratic aspect of each of us is \"in and of' the World of Y etzirah in the same sense that our physical bodies are \"in and of' the physical world. In awakening to con­scious awareness of Y etzirah, we learn to see past the veil of our physical senses to the wondrous world behind them, a world of magic and fantasy, of psychic realities and shifting tides, and of energies too subtle for physical sensation. The next plane is the World of Briah, literally \"the Creative World.\" It corresponds to Water. Even into the 21st Century, most humans have lived their entire lives oblivious to this stratum of consciousness. Yet, Briah is well within human reach: it is the nat­ural level of the spiritually illuminated. Throughout history, many thousands of people have testified to this from their own experi­ence. Waking into Briah from the sleep of personality is an unveil­ing of those soul-nourishing spiritual realities normally hidden by the drapings of human sensation, emotion, and thought, a perceiv­ing past the ever shifting and personal to the enduring and transpersonal. Beyond the turbulent water of troubled emotion and rebounding thought is the serene embrace of the Great Mother, the profound peace of vibrant stillness, and an end of any sense of sep-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"22 Visions & Voices aration. This is Briah. The highest (inmost, most exalted, most subtle) of the Four Worlds is the World of Atziluth, the so-called \"Archetypal World.\"1 It corresponds to Fire. Atziluth is the realm of the divine. The Atziluthic within us is the ESSENCE behind the highest intuitive and philosophical perceptions of \"God\" that humanity has had, be­cause it is that aspect of ourselves that is truly Creator. As you may expect, only a handful of people known to history have become authentically awake in the World of Atziluth. The Functional Basis of Astrology I consider these Four Worlds to be as objective as any other categorized facts in science. Their distinctions are constitutional, even organic. They are so familiar to me that I have described them as much from personal experience as from traditional ac­counts. I emphasize this because I believe the Four Worlds model brings to astrology something it has never had: a clear, satisfying understanding of the mechanism of how astrology works. Attractive as it may be to seek a physical basis for astrology, none has ever been found. Nor do I think we ever shall explain as­trology with the physical sciences. It is the wrong place to look. Speaking in Qabalistic language, astrological influences are not rooted in Assiah. Rather, they exist in the World ofYetzirah. Imagine: Astrological forces originating in that plane of exist­ence that occultists have long insisted on calling astral! As ex­plained above, it is \"a world... of psychic realities and shifting tides, and of energies too subtle for physical sensation.\" I am certain that, in human affairs, the direct influence of as­trological factors is on the psyche, especially on the field of sub­consciousness. The more deeply we understand the convergence of astrological patterns with individual and collective subcon­scious patterns, the more easily will we understand how astrology This use of \"archetypal\" (lit., \"oldest pattern\") differs from the best-known modem use, which is that of C. G. Jung. Archetypes, in the sense Jung used the term, are natural to Briah. The traditional title of Atziluth might be best under­stood to mean the World of the Archeryper, rather than of the archetype itself. llml5 .. relalioll 1llcoly Oil the cal '1lluable"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"� jJ) of the Four - \"Archetypal th� di�i�e. t mtmttve as had, be­•• As you may • have become �· t· � as any other �constitutional, t-ve described �itional ac­rworlds model tJear, satisfying !Jiarks. 11 for astrology, 1JaU explain as­J place to look. �cesare not lfetzirah. �e of exist­f-tral!

The impact of celestial influences on natural phenomena (from plant growth to earthquakes) is also best understood as an effect originating in this subtle, formative layer just behind physi­cal existence. Everything I have ever observed or intuited about astrology's individual, collective, and natural out-workings is con­firmed by this one explanation . As we explore the symbolic contents of Aleister Crowley's vi­sions in relation to their concurrent astrological patterns, the above theory on the mechanism of astrological influences will have sev­eral valuable things to teach us. The Tree of Life: The Ten Sephiroth Within the Four Worlds, Qabalists recognize ten progressive emanations of Deity called sephiroth (sing., sephirah, i11�:Jo). Each of these ten ideas is associated with a large body of doctrine, because the ten, together, are deemed to express all aspects of real­ity; but the root ideas are relatively simple, and those most im­portant to understanding the present book will be summarized here.

Its deep exploration is a lifetime study. However, here are the most important things you need to know now: The Tree of Life is a map of human consciousness. Such a map permits you to organize ideas (all you can perceive), much as as­trologers learn to relate different aspects of experience to the plan­ets and other astrological categories. Therefore, the Tree of Life is a \"map of the universe,\" or of the interrelationship of everything around us. And, because it is a map both of human consciousness (the universe \"inside\") and all things we can know in our world (the universe \"outside\"), the Tree of Life also serves as the perfect pattern for formal stages of spiritual initiation. That is, the Tree is used to map a progressive revelation of expanding consciousness opening from Malkuth (the circle numbered 10) to Kether (the circle marked 1). Take a few moments to look at the Tree of Life diagram. Real­ly look it over! See its basic patterns: It has ten circles (the ten se­phiroth tabulated above), arranged in three columns of three, four, and three circles, respectively; or, alternately, three triangles, be­neath which a final circle is pendent. Complementary ideas are placed opposite each other, left and right (for example, Mercury and Venus in sephiroth 8 and 7, reflecting the polarity of intellect and desire). The primary advance of consciousness is up the mid­dle column in sephiroth corresponding to what astrologers call the \"personal points\": the angles (10), Moon (9), and Sun (6), ascend­ing (or opening inward) toward the idea of Self ( 1 ). The elements are attributed to the sephiroth as follows: Fire spirals from Chokmah (sephirah 2, called The Father and the Root of Fire) through sephiroth 5 (Geburah) and 7 (Netzach), finally wrapping around to the left side of Malkuth (10). Water spirals from Binah (sephirah 3, called The Mother and the Root of Water) through sephiroth 4 (Chesed) and 8 (Hod), finally wrapping around to the right side of Malkuth. Equilibrating this Fire-Water polarity is androgynous Air, rooted in Kether (sephirah 1, the Root of Air) and extending down the Middle Pillar through sephiroth 6 (Tipher­eth) and 9 (Y esod), eventuating in the top quarter of Malkuth. On­ly sephirah 10, Malkuth, is attributed to Earth per se."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"26 Visions & Voices The first three sephiroth (numbers 1, 2, and 3) are called the Supernal Sephiroth, or simply the Supernals. They represent the highest mapped states of consciousness. Between these three and the remainder of the Tree is the Abyss. This was described near the start of the Introduction as \"the immeasurable gulf between human and divine consciousness.\" The Abyss is especially im­portant to the subject matter of this present book. The aspect of consciousness represented by each sephirah (giv­en in the table above) will be discussed in more detail in the \"Qab­alistic Psychology\" section below. Although the three outer planets are not part of this ancient Tree of Life model, it is sometimes useful to associate them with part of the Tree. When doing so, I believe the following will prove the most useful attributions: Pluto - Kether Uranus - Chokmah Neptune - The Abyss Small channels, or pathways of energy (shifting conscious­ness), connect the sephiroth. These paths will be discussed in the next section below. If you want to learn more about the sephiroth and their rela­tionships within the Tree of Life, I recommended any of the fol­lowing well-rounded introductory texts: The Mystical Qabalah by Dion Fortune (the best introduction in print, but most students do better skipping the rather tedious Part I and beginning immediately with Part II); The Ladder of Lights by William Gray; The Sword & the Serpent by Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips; The Study of the Kabalah by William Wynn Westcott; and A Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism by Gareth Knight.

These three parts, known to metaphysicians and some psychologists as subconsciousness, ego-consciousness, and superconsciousness, are called by Qabalists, respectively, Nephesh, Ruach, and Neshamah. Each of these Hebrew words literally means both \"breath\" and \"soul.\" Their characteristics are as follows: NESHAMAH. Consciousness corresponding to the three Su­pernal sephiroth is called Neshamah (i17JIDJ) or superconsciousness (cosmic consciousness). This is the spiritual unconscious, in con­trast to the instinctual unconscious of Nephesh. It includes spiritual aspiration as its hunger or desire expression, equivalent to the physical hunger and reproductive desire of Nephesh. Neshamah has three distinct aspects: • Yechidah (i11�n�), attributed to sephirah 1, Kether. The name means \"the only one.\" This is the \"Higher (indivisi­ble) Self,\" the uncharacterized seed-principle of a being. • Chiah (i1�n), corresponding to sephirah 2, Chokmah, is the life force, creative impulse, and inmost Will: Yechidah 's power of choice, or inherent path, arising from the unlim­ited expression of Itself. Where Yechidah is expressed by the verb \"to be,\" its characterless being has no distinction In this book, the ligature 0 is used to represent Spirit.

RUACH: The middle part of the human psyche is Roach (n11), or ego-consciousness, attributed to the six sephiroth from Chesed (4) to Yesod (9). These embody organs especially of rea­son, ego-formation, and governance. NEPHESH: The oldest part of the human psyche, attributed to Yesod (sephirah 9) and Malkuth (sephirah 10), is Nephesh (ID:JJ), or subconsciousness. It consists of more primitive instincts, reflex­es, reactive patterns, and autonomic functions; hence its titles \"An­imal Soul\" and \"Vital Soul.\" (Note that all of these involve repeti­tive and responsive behavior.) Nephesh is the instinctual uncon­scious, in contrast to the spiritual unconscious of Neshamah. Y esod corresponds to the psychological (nonmaterial) patterns of subconsciousness, and is thus innately linked to Ruach. Malkuth corresponds to the biological aspects of Nephesh rooted in the physical body. There is continuous interaction between these phys­ical and paraphysical aspects of Nephesh in all living things. GUPH: One more layer needs to be mentioned in addition to the three parts of the psyche. It is the physical body, called Guph (�1l) in Hebrew. Expressed in psychological terms, Guph, attribut­ed to Malkuth, corresponds to the field of sensory perception that registers our physical environment. The Three .!Eons This model of the human psyche is useful in understanding an­other often obscure model, that of the three JEons. At the time Crowley received The Book of the Law in 1904, some anthropologists had been focusing, for many years, on evi­dence of a matriarchal and matrilineal stage in human culture that The same term is used both for the overall category of superconsciousness, and for the distinctive mode or aspect attributed to Binah, its gateway."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"30 Visions & Voices had preceded the patriarchal and patrilineal form that had been principal especially in Europe for thousands of years. Besides family structure and political and other social patterns believed to exist in this prior time, there were believed to be reli­gious forms distinctive to the two broad time periods, as well as characteristic scientific models (particularly in astronomy) and commonplace theories of human reproduction. Anthropology has gone further and has understood these things better in the century intervening. There were likely no discrete pe­riods of time when all of these varied elements coexisted in quite the way previously thought. Nonetheless, it is important to under­stand how the theories of his day affected Crowley's thinking, and also to understand what deeper actualities may have been working their way toward our conscious awareness in these earlier theories. It is worth examining some of these patterns briefly. Regarding procreation, common sense assures us that there surely was a time when the link between sexual intercourse and pregnancy was unknown. Early humans had sex, just as they did any number of other activities, and (with no necessary link ob­served) women got pregnant and delivered babies. During this time, everything from pragmatic respect to religious awe would have centered on woman in this role. Women did this amazing thing all by themselves! At some point, though, the connection of pregnancy to sex would have been discovered, and this seems to have coincided with a shift of importance and social regard to the man. Creator gods replaced creator goddesses. The prevailing theory, then, was that men deposited children within women, whose job was \"mere­ly\" to bear them nine months and deliver them whole. At Crow­ley's birth, this was still the general scientific theory of reproduc­tion. I have seen one medical textbook as late as the 1920s assert­ing the same position. However, by the dawn of the 20th Century, there was an emerg­ing theory gaining ground that man and woman equally contribut­ed parts of themselves to the creation of a child. That new knowledge would be pivotal in reformulating human thought and culture.

Regarding astronomy, we can track a different progression. There was a time when primitive humanity was interested almost exclusively in the conditions of the Earth-which certainly felt sol­id and unmoving! - and the wonders of the heavens (especially the nocturnal heavens) made them seem, most likely, the domains of gods. Astronomy was visual, not conceptual or mathematical, which means that it was lunar rather than solar: You could see the stars at night and the Moon's monthly passage across them, but could not witness the stars behind the Sun. As late as early first millennium CE, Egyptian astronomers (who were pretty sophisti­cated) were still recording primarily lunar passages, although they had learned to track the Sun indirectly - by noticing the stars oppo­site the Sun's position, those that first rose at sunset. On the other hand, another way to identify these stars was a lunar way: the oc­currence, within a particular star field, of the Full Moon. In the last millennium or two BCE, though, other solar phe­nomena had started to gamer attention. In particular, the Sun's an­nual seasonal cycle, swinging from high declination at summer solstice to walking low around the sky at winter solstice, appeared to be the life-rhythm of a great god of light that waxed and waned in strength. Even more so, the Sun's daily behavior looked like the birthing, triumphing, and dying of heaven's greatest lord, only to be resurrected afresh the next morning. It is no wonder, then, that humanity's heroes and greatest gods became expressions of the Sun's seasonal and diurnal behavior. In time, a slain or dying god, resurrected to new life and bringing new light, became the reli­gious embodiment of many cultures' highest ideals. Medieval and Renaissance astronomy brought an end to the astronomical theories on which these ideas originally were based, though it took well into the 18th Century for the fall of geocentrism and related scientific models to find deep acceptance. By 1904, the world was ready for a new perspective. Part of this new astronomical vision arose from a revolution in theoretical physics. In particular, 1904 also marked breakthroughs by Albert Einstein which led eventually to two competing and"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"32 Visions & Voices seemingly mutually exclusive models: a general theory of relativ­ity, which works only in very large realms1 but collapses entirely in microscopic contexts; and a quantum theory that flourishes in the microscopic2 yet collapses in the macroscopic. Soon the cru­sade began to find a unifying model wedding these two \"parent\" theories. 21st Century physics may have found their \"child\" in the string theory of particle physics. Regarding religion, especially in the West, patterns have un­folded more or less paralleling the astronomical theories mentioned above. In simple terms, primitive religions were focused primarily on Earth and the Moon. These, in time, were succeeded by a wave of religions that were primarily solar, and which particularly cele­brated by metaphor the annual and daily birth-death-resurrection cycle of the Sun. The religion that Liber Legis introduced for a new stage of human evolution is stellar; that is, it is superficially solar, but recognizes the Sun no longer as a ruling father, king, or god, but as simply one more star amid countless other stars. All of this is terribly interesting to me and to many others. It shows many kinds of progression from an essentially feminine set of ideas, to ideas essentially masculine, to ... something else: an era of \"child\" ideas that necessarily arise only from the collusion of their predecessors. What this survey does not provide, however, is a coherent time line demarcating distinctive \"reons\" or zones of time, when all the feminine ideas lined up together, then were sup­planted by all the masculine ones. In the late 19th and early 20th Century, though, the idea of a \"matriarchal\" time supplanted by a \"patriarchy\" was quite popular. When the message of The Book of the Law began to sink in for Crowley, he began to conceive of human history in three phases, or reons. He had already been told that the New lEon just beginning was ruled by Horus, successor to his father Osiris. It was natural, therefore, to relate the earliest phase to Horus' mother (and Osiris' mate), Isis. Thus, he began to write of the .!Eon of Isis, the .!Eon of Osiris, and the .!Eon of Horus, which we might more generically Consider the Thelemic goddess Nuit: the infinite circle, or all of space. 2 Consider the Thelemic god Hadit, who is the infinitesimal center, the in-most seed-idea or point of view. llj-781 .. -�---......... .16• ..... �!.��iii • _, , ... billi .......

But is there any legitimacy to these ideas at all? If they are not reflective of a convergence of social, political, familial, scientific, religious, and other overlapping ideas, are they anything at all? I think they are. There is a further history of evolution in the human species that these \"reons\" actually map. It is the progressive development of each successive stratum of the human psyche. I define the lEon of Isis as that period of history when the baseline level of functioning of the typical adult human was Nephesh, or what we now call subconsciousness. This is still the typical state of consciousness of non-domestic animals (and, most­ly, of most domestic animals), and what we term the infantile level of consciousness in modem humans. It is characterized by a herd­like collectivity, a natural empathic and even telepathic rapport, and a closer link to the land and all the forms of life arising from it. I define the lEon of Osiris as that period of history when the baseline level of functioning of the typical adult human has been Roach (ego-consciousness) - that is, the \"conscious\" mind pres­ently characteristic of a typical psychologically healthy human adult. This period has also been characterized by the reactive sup­pression of things most associated with \"Isis\" stage consciousness, including women, children, and small animals (as emblematic of Nephesh consciousness), and substantial conscious suppression and minimization of our relationship to subconsciousness in gen­eral, in the emergence of individual ego-distinction from the shared communion of subconsciousness. I accept, based on evidence persuasive to me, that at some point around the start of the 20th Century humanity entered a third developmental phase. It is comfortable to me to accept that this is the LEon of Horus that Crowley said began in 1904, because that This casual use of the word \"age\" should not be confused with its astrologi­cal use. For example, the astrological Age of Pisces extends from 220-2376 CE, flowing right across the transition from the lEon of Osiris to that of Horus in 1904. (At the Vernal Equinox 1904, the vernal point was at 6°1{35'51\".)"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"34 Visions & Voices label and approximate timing match what I can observe from other information channels. And, as you surely will have anticipated by now, I define the .lEon of Horus as that period of time within which the baseline level of functioning of the typical adult human will emerge as Neshamah, or what we generally call supercon­sciousness. Obviously, we are not there yet! Similarly, even in re­cent centuries we can see significant development in human ego formation, so that the Osiris lEon must be viewed as having been a gradual unfolding. Political liberty, for example, is a relatively new idea, measurable in mere centuries. The King Arthur myth, roughly a thousand years old, is a remarkable example of a solar king (symbolic of our baseline ego development) who, in all his majesty and glory, is still but a boy (as was collective ego-development of his time), still struggling with his relationships with Isis lEon ideas. The ego was not a new invention of consciousness anytime in the last several thousand years; however, it has undergone substan­tial maturation in only the last few hundred, suggesting that it is a relatively new \"organ\" in recent millennia.1 Similarly, supercon­sciousness is not new to humanity. Books such as Maurice Bucke's Cosmic Consciousness and William James' The Varieties of Reli­gious Experience document important parts of its gradual emer­gence. But, for most of human history, it has been proportionately rare. As the 20th Century dawned, it seems that active, aware cos­mic consciousness was becoming much more common. We are looking at a \"hundredth monkey\" type of effect. Indi­vidual people have long awakened faculties of consciousness that typical people do not even know about, let alone use. But that does not mean that typical people do not have these faculties available to them. When a sufficient (small) percentage of people awaken these faculties, some mechanism - whether a shared band of con­sciousness, or the impact of social spread -will cause this awaken­ing to spread radically across the face of humanity. Should not our purpose, then, be to awaken these faculties within ourselves, and encourage them in others?

Spirituality is like a muscle that can be trained. My earlier book, The Mystical & Magical System of the A . ·.A . ·., details one system of accomplishing this. The present book provides another way, which is the awakening of modes of consciousness by sympathetic exposure . Light & Night For thousands of years, it has been commonplace to describe the agent of spiritual awakening as light. Even the word \"awaken­ing\" implies a response to daybreak. Language becomes much blunter in words like illumination and enlightenment. St. John of the Cross (1542-1591) was among the earliest adept mystics in the West to write openly of higher spiritual states to which the metaphor \"light\" simply cannot apply, because 1. they exceed all of the inner states to which \"light\" is typi­cally and intuitively applied and 2. their experience is a painful, burning purgatory. Instead, in his book The Dark Night of the Soul, he wrote of a spir­itual \"dark night\" which he explained as \"purgative contemplation, which causes passively in the soul the negation of itself.. .. \" That is, it is ego annihilating. This darkness, please remember, is not the initial gloom and obscurity in which novices wander at the beginning of their inner pilgrimage. Rather, the candidate for the experiences St. John de­scribed has already come awake to deep spiritual communion with the Divine. This aspirant has already \"come into the Light.\" In the magical path we would call them Adept. But in going beyond their acquired illumination \"to attain to living the sweet and delectable life of love with God,\" a deep mortification of the ego must occur: we must die to ourselves in order to come alive to something deep­er. This, St. John wrote, the soul \"is able to accomplish in the strength and ardour which love for its Spouse gave to it.. .. \" Love is indeed the key. The Dark Night of the Soul may be rightly called a Western classic of bhakti yoga. The parching, bum-"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"36 Visions & Voices ing dryness of this dark night is the consuming passion of an Adept for the Divine. Students already familiar with The Vision & the Voice will recognize Crowley's ego-mortifying, reason-surrender­ing, soul-incinerating passion for the goddess Babalon in St. John's descriptions of the night wherein lover and Beloved are joined. Modem magical schools following the Rosicrucian model (such as the Golden Dawn) commonly refer to pure spiritual force by the Latin word for \"light,\" which is lux (in all capitals, LVX). This is commonly written by such schools as if it were an abbre­viation, L.V.X., because the individual letters have distinctive sig­nificance in the rubric of their rituals. Accordingly, when looking for a companion term to describe that spiritual night that succeeds the brilliance of a spiritual day, Aleister Crowley adopted the Latin word for \"night,\" which is nox, and wrote it as N.O.X. This term refers to awakened supercon­sciousness, an intensification of spiritual light (L.V.X.) to such a level as to exceed one's capacity to perceive it. It refers to super­nal, not infernal, darkness. Consider the differences of sunlight within the Earth's atmos­phere from sunlight in open space. We see a brightly illuminated sky on a clear, sunny day not simply because the Sun is shining, but specifically because its light bounces off of air molecules. Psy­chologically, this air analogizes to Ruach, the ego-centered, self­conscious rational mind. Only because it has something to \"bounce off of' does spiritual light (sunlight) create images, ideas, or sim­ple illuminated splendor within our psyches. But continue further - rise upward beyond the boundary of at­mosphere and cross the threshold of space - and there is actually more sunlight, not less. Yet space (however saturated with un­countable sources of light) is itself dark. It is a higher experience, one that opens us to greater awareness and greater possibilities, yet is better described as night than as light. As similarly described in the Vision of the 2nd LEthyr: ... I asked of an Angel that is at my side if the ceremony hath been duly performed. And he says: Yes, the lEthyr is present. It is thou that canst not perceive it... because it is so entirely beyond thy conception that there is nothing in thy mind on to which it can cast a symbol, even as the emptiness of space is not heated by the fire of the sun. And so pure"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"iEthyr: Qabalistic & Magical Concepts 37 is the light that it preventeth the formation of images, and therefore have men called it darkness. These metaphors of light and night appear in diverse spiritual works of many religions. Within the Thelemic holy books that Crowley had received by 1909, we find dozens of references that are obscure without the above understanding. For example, Liber LXV openly tells us, \"There is a light so strenuous that it is not per­ceived as light.\" Liber Legis speaks of \"the light higher than eye­sight;\" and, earlier in the same text, Crowley was told, \" ... thou hast all in the clear light, and some, though not all, in the dark.\" Grades in the Golden Dawn & A.·. A.·. Aleister Crowley belonged to, and received initiation in, two magical Orders that use similar nomenclature, but not to mean ex­actly the same things. The period when these visions were re­ceived (1900-1909) marked transition from one Order to the other, and we will use their shared nomenclature frequently in the pages ahead. I want to disentangle potential confusion before it strikes. The Orders in question were the Golden Dawn (including its successor, the A:.O:.), into which Crowley was initiated in 1897, and A:.A:., which he co-founded in 1906. Both Orders comprise a series of grades modeled on the Tree of Life. (Look again at the Tree of Life diagram on page 24 for reference.) The grades begin at the bottom of the Tree, with sephirah 10, and move up. Each grade (in both Orders) is designated by two numbers. The first is the sequential number of the grade (1, 2, 3, &c.). The se­cond is the number of the sephirah corresponding. Thus, the first grade, corresponding to the tenth sephirah, is called 1 = 1 0. Moving up the Tree of Life, the second grade corresponds to sephirah 9, and therefore is marked 2=9. Notice that all of these labels consist of two numbers totaling 11. This has Qabalistic significance, but is especially mentioned now because it makes it easier to remember what number pairs go together. The ten theoretical grades of such a system are thus labeled: 1=10,2=9,3=8,4=7,5=6,6=5, 7=4,8=3,9=2,and 10=1.Remem-"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"38 Visions & Voices her: the first number is the actual grade number (1st grade, 2nd grade, &c.), and the second number identifies the sephirah on the Tree of Life to which the grade symbolically corresponds. There is also a preliminary grade labeled 0=0, and a couple of unnumbered grades serving as transitions between main sections of the Order. Both the Golden Dawn and A:.A:. used these same designa­tions similarly. For example, both used \"5=6\" to mean the fifth main grade of the system, corresponding to sephirah 6, Tiphereth. However, the same nomenclature has unequal meaning when the two Orders are compared side-by-side. It is much like calling the second year of both college and high school \"sophomore.\" The term has the same basic meaning, but a college sophomore and a high school sophomore are not equal to each other. They both rep­resent the same stage of their respective contexts (college vs. high school), but one is significantly more advanced. The Golden Dawn was the high school level of spiritual educa­tion. A:.A:. is college. Both systems, in their grade labels, attach a circle to the first number and a square to the second, e.g., 5°=6°. Although these characters have symbolic importance within the Orders, that is not particularly important for the present discussion. I mention it now only because it gives us a way to visually distinguish references to the same grade level in one of these Orders from the other. Purely as a typographical convention of this book, I use the circle and square when I intend an A:.A:. grade (e.g., 5°=6°), and not when I mean a Golden Dawn grade (e.g., 5=6). As with our high school sophomore and college sophomore, the same title in each of the systems refers to a different absolute accomplishment. As a practical example, the 5=6 in the Golden Dawn is a stage where the initiate solemnly swears to aspire to and attain a particular spiritual threshold; but the A:.A:. grade called 5°=6° marks one who actually has attained that threshold. The most meaningful and useful way to understand the differ­ences of scale of these two systems is to examine them not in terms of the sephiroth but, rather, in terms of the Four Worlds described earlier.

Within this, the sephiroth are useful for a more granular system, and their symbolism adds richness to the whole. But the climactic, breakthrough levels - the real grade differences - are found in suc­cessive opening to each of the Four Worlds. The real difference between the Golden Dawn and A:.A:. frameworks, then, is in their scaling; that is, the sephiroth scale across the Four Worlds differently. The following table shows how the grades of the two systems scale to the Four Worlds.

When he was admitted to the 5=6 Grade of the Golden Dawn in 1900, and asserted attainment of 7=4 in 1905, the main information we learn from the above table is that he had been opened to, and ma­tured in, the World of Y etzirah, and was consciously working therein. In A:.A:. terms, he attained to 5°=6°-a Briatic awak­ening -in 1906; but at that time he only had for reference the older framework in which the parting of the veil to Briah appeared as 8=3. Thereafter, we find him self-initiating to 6°=5° (A:.A:. scale) in October 1908, recording in his diary that he had previous­ly attained the grade in the natural world (i.e., Yetzirah) but not in the spiritual world (i.e., Briah). And so on."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"40 Visions & Voices The Angel & the Abyss While labels such as \"Adept\" and \"Master\" provide a useful map of inner world terrain, the map should not be mistaken for the land it portrays. Let us move on, then, from label toward actuality, by discussing two signature spiritual experiences frequently men­tioned throughout this book. Though the same experiences may have different names in dif­ferent traditions, we will stick with the terms Aleister Crowley used. (These are most useful in understanding his visions.) Within the A:.A:. system, the threshold experience of adept­hood is called the Knowledge & Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. That of mastery is called crossing the Abyss. By their very nature, these experiences are unfamiliar to most people. Therefore, the best possible language will still fall short, having nothing in the hearer's experience with which to pair the words. It is something of a truism, in mystical and magical circles, that, on topics such as these, \"those who know do not speak, and those who speak do not know.\" This is partly from the difficulty in finding appropriate language to describe the indescribable; and partly because speaking to anyone about something outside their experience sets them up to misunderstand and attach wrong con­cepts to the words, responding primarily to their own projections. But, I feel, my duty as teacher must trump the above concerns. Having alerted you to the difficulties of expressing these ideas in conventional language, I charge ahead. A hierophant (\"revealer of the mysteries\") soon learns that teaching Truth is not the same as speaking Truth; that, as the inexpressible cannot be expressed, one must find the most effective lies that will trigger someone to ac­quire Truth on their own, just as the Magus must \"beware of absti­nence from action\" and \"speak Truth, that the Falsehood thereof may enslave the souls of men.\" So ... with such encouragement. .. onward!

This idea overlaps significantly (in many people's experience) with the related-but-different idea being explained in this section. The term \"Holy Guardian Angel\" (abbreviated H.G.A.) traces to a greatly respected medieval grimoire titled The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage. A threshold mystical attainment within A:.A:. (and some other systems) is called the \"Knowledge and Conversation\" of the H.G.A. Superficially, beginners often under­stand these words to mean an inner dialogue; and, in fact, one early stage in spiritual awakening is just such a dialogue, or recurring conversation, with one who seems a wise and loving guide, and from whom one can receive direction and learn many things. It is described with great beauty in the gospel hymn \"In the Garden\" by C. Austin Miles. But this intuitive awakening is not what is meant by \"Knowledge and Conversation of the H.G.A.\" Both \"knowledge\" and \"conversation\" have a relevant archaic meaning in English, barely surviving in modem times: both mean sexual union. Knowledge retains this meaning in Biblical refer­ences such as \"Adam knew Eve,\" and the phrase \"carnal knowledge.\" Conversation had this meaning from at least the early 16th Century, barely surviving in a later term for adultery, \"crimi­nal conversation.\" The technical term \"Knowledge & Conversation\" means pro­found intimacy. This mystical experience has many of the sensory and psychological characteristics of the most profound sexual un­ion, and is with a Divine Other. The nature of the experience is perhaps the most personal and uniquely distinctive of all human experiences. The nature of the object of this union, the one we are calling \"Holy Guardian Angel,\" varies enormously from person to person, but the characteristic of it being another is central to the experience. This is not onanism: it is intercourse. Therefore, in Rosicrucian traditions, the experience is symbol­ized by a rosy cross: Neither the rose itself, nor the cross itself, but the one mounted upon the other, the two exultant in their union. Also, the Thelemic Book of the Law refers to one who has attained this experience as a \"Lover.\""},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"42 Visions & Voices Qabalists veil it in their (perhaps intentionally obscure) term 110, sod (rhymes with \"road\"), which literally means \"secret\" and refers to THE Secret: If you compare this word to the table on page 27, you will see that its three letters correspond to the Tarot trumps Art (an angelic figure corresponding to Sagittarius), The Hiero­phant (lit., \"revealer of the mysteries\"), and The Empress (who is Venus): an Angel (0) who is both Teacher (1) and Lover (1). The essence of the experience, then, is: profoundly personal intimate union with a Divine Other. Which brings us to the most common question on this matter: What exactly is this \"Holy Guardian Angel\"? In particular, is it really some kind of angel or another sort of separate being; or is it but a psychological fiction, a projection of one's hopes and aspira­tions, ultimately expressing some deeper, unexpressed aspect of oneself, e.g., Yechidah? My answer is: It doesn't matter. Really. It certainly does not matter until after one has had the experi­ence, after which one can draw one's own conclusions. But (and here I admittedly risk overreaching, since this experience is so in­dividual and personal), whether or not the H.G.A. is truly another, one must aspire to it as such. The alternative is to hyper-inflate one's ego. One must lose oneself in something that is in no recog­nizable sense part of what one understands to be oneself. Admittedly, that only addresses method. But I guarantee the actuality of this threshold will be outside any ofyour prior experi­ence. I echo Crowley when I assert that a single moment of this experience will seem more real than the whole of your prior life. Besides, the experience occurs in the World of Briah. You may recall that a characteristic of Briah is an end of any sense of sepa­ration. By the time the question, \"Is the Angel truly another, or an aspect of myself?\" becomes relevant, it is moot. It is to this experience, the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, that A:.A:. seeks to bring everyone. The Order deems it the Next Step for humanity in general (and each individual in particular). But for the present book it is only im­portant to recognize the term when it is encountered in Aleister Crowley's visions and frequently mentioned in my commentary. l'lle.Abyu Sca.wl, a I _..,.

The Abyss Qabalistic & Magical Concepts 43 And, after losing oneself in another, there comes a time to \"lose\"-or, even better, \"loose\"- oneself altogether. The Abyss is a Qabalistic concept mentioned previously. It lies between the top three (Supernal) sephiroth on the Tree of Life and the rest of the Tree. (Review again the Tree of Life diagram on page 24.) Crossing this Abyss is crossing the immeasurable gulf between human and divine consciousness. The series of visions in this book document the process of Aleister Crowley making this crossing. I remember struggling with the idea of the Abyss during my earliest studies of Qabalah. Of course, I could understand the basic idea as an intellectual construct, but I could not reify that construct. Three ideas helped me understand it better, and I give them here. I do not suggest that what follows is truth, only that it is useful. First, a mathematical idea: The Abyss arcs between Binah (se­phirah 3) and Chesed (sephirah 4). One way to understand the se­phiroth numbers is geometrically: Binah, 3, suggests 3 points which define a 2-dimensional plane; Chesed, 4, suggests 4 points which define a 3-dimensional solid. Therefore, the gap between Binah and Chesed can be conceived as the gap between a blueprint and the building it depicts, or between an idea and its manifesta­tion, or between any 2-D representation and 3-D actuality. This gap is infinite. Meditating on this gave me my first impression of the scope of the gap called the Abyss. Second, a mythological idea: Many mythic systems portray popular gods as a younger generation that overthrew their parents (an idea popular in every generation). The leader of this insurrec­tion is commonly a Jupiter-themed god, such as Jupiter himself, the Greek Zeus, the Babylonian Marduk, &c. In each case, this god led other gods in supplanting the Old Ones (Kronos, Tiamat, &c.) and imprisoning them for all time (in the deeps, or behind a wall, &c.). As the lead god in each case is associated with Chesed (the highest sephirah on the Tree of Life associated with Ruach: ego, intellect), and those rebelling were all a \"next generation\" of gods, these myths all speak of newly born psychological powers walling"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"44 Visions & Voices off our actual contact with more ancient deities (more primal spir­itual forces) behind a rigid ego-barricade. Meditating on these myths taught me much about the nature of the Abyss as a moat sealing off the fortified ramparts of the ego. Third is the Hebrew legend of The Fall, arguably the most cru­cial myth in the Western world. There is no need to review it: Eve­ry reader knows its details. The important point now is that The Fall is a myth portraying the emergence of the self-conscious ego- Ruach birthing from Nephesh. That is, it documents the transition from the lEon of Isis to the lEon of Osiris, and lays the symbolic groundwork for the eventual overthrowing of that by the lEon of Horus. Eden, symbolic of the womb, represents the stage when Ne­phesh (subconsciousness) was the normal human consciousness. The Eden legend portrays, in symbolic language, how Ruach emerged. It concludes with Kerubim and the Flaming Sword (the raw spiritual force inherent in the Tree of Life pattern) placed to mark and ward the road of our return. Eden from which we emerged is Nephesh; but Eden to which we return is Nesharnah.1 Each of these three ideas gives a key to the nature of crossing back across this threshold. First, we recognize the truly infinite scope of the step, even as the gap is infinite between the number of points in a 3-D object and any of its 2-D surfaces. Second, we ad­mit that what cuts us off from the primal spiritual forces rightly called the Ancient Ones, the gods of the Golden Age, is the forti­fied perimeter of our ego that keeps us locked into a separate, cut­off, and isolated state; but there are means to overthrow the gods of our present psycho-spiritual Establishment and open wide the gates to the deep. Third, the road to this sacred vault is clearly marked and leads to the Supernal Eden, the shore of the Great Sea of the sephirah Binah. Perhaps it is unnecessary to add that not everyone is immedi­ately (or ever) ready for this step. However, so many who turn to magick speak so heedlessly of crossing the Abyss (as if it were As the Tree of Knowledge gave humanity access to Ruach, the promise of the Tree of Life is that it would give access to Neshamah. ���=:I buih it well.

It is a hollow act to \"abandon all\" when one has little to abandon and little to offer. It is fruitless to transcend reason if one has never developed one's mind in the first place. The devel­opmental step is not to be without ego, but to grow beyond ego . As the Vision of the gth JEthyr makes clear, it is the Holy Guardian Angel that leads one to the threshold of the Abyss: True service to life (as to oneself) calls for us first to embrace the Angel before being swallowed by the Abyss. Choronzon & Da'ath In the highly tolerant philosophy of Thelema, it is difficult to conceive of an out-and-out \"devil.\" Devils in most historic reli­gions commonly bear the names of the gods of conquered enemies, or express the shadow-face of one's highest ideals. (Consider the root meaning of devil, \"to slander, to attack,\" a candid admission of the projections it embodies.) But, as a philosophy that common­ly sees beyond theological dualism and broadly accepts that \"each thing is right in the right place\" - that has sometimes been con­fused with Satanism mostly because it is not anti-Satanic -Thele­ma would seem fairly immune to such demonizing. Its adherents, on the other hand, are not so immune -not even Thelema's prophet and chief proponent. To give expression to the shadow-face ofThelema, with its preeminent doctrine of Will (and Will's intimate companion, Love), enter the great arch-demon Choronzon, embodiment ofthe Anti-Will and alien to love! Choronzon is first mentioned in the diaries of John Dee: But Coronzon (for so is the name of that mighty devil), envying man's felicity, and perceiving that the substance of man's lesser part was frail and unperfect in respect to his purer essence, began to assail man, and so prevailed. Crowley transliterated this name into Hebrew as 111 J111n = 333. He was taken with the correspondences of this number in Greek: OKOAacrta, \"incontinence, dispersion,\" and aKpacrta, \"in­continence\"; in other words, lack of concentration and control."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"46 Visions & Voices (The Anti-Will!) Crowley seems not to have known, that, in He­brew, 333 is also the value ofl'tZ7ni1, \"the darkness,\" and i101n'!Z7i1, \"the slaughtered�\" All in all, a perfectly serviceable devil. Choronzon is also a practical embodiment the Qabalistic idea of Da'ath, which literally means \"Knowledge.\" Some consider Da'ath to be an 11th sephirah on the Tree of Life. Without wading too deeply into what amounts to a semantical debate, let us call it a pseudo-sephirah. Da'ath exists in the Abyss. In its earliest appearance in Kabba­listic literature, it was a stand-in for the three supernal sephiroth­apparently acknowledging that Knowledge is, at best, a stand-in for its object. One could, for example, have (a) God or (�) knowledge about God-the two are incompatible, reason failing to express the arational. As the Ruach became more dominant in the human psyche over the last millennium (as the LEon of Osiris ma­tured), the idea of Da'ath evolved. Modem Qabalists treat it as, at once, the gateway to superconscious states beyond it, and the last impediment to them. In its outer aspect, facing toward Ruach, Da' ath represents the apex of the conventional idea of \"knowledge.\" Conceive of it, for example, as all knowledge from all sources being simultaneously present and accessible - all data points being at once in one's mind. The conventional term for this state is ... madness! To hit this state and fall back from it is to go mad in one's worship of the God of Data. Notice how this state describes Choronzon, whose name sym­bolically means incontinence and dispersion! But with a shift in the functioning of the brain so that polarity means identity rather than separation - shifting in a big way from seeing the trees to seeing the forest, from obsession with data­particles to perceiving and conceiving globally - this changes from chaotic madness to peaceful, lucid sanity, becoming saner than one has ever been before. Remember, from the previous discussion of the Holy Guardian Angel, that \"knowledge\" retains its old meaning of sexual union. Victory over the dispersion of Choronzon is in the unfathomable love represented in these visions by the goddess Babalon. .. •d•llle .. ID C!ji:MI4-...

Chapter 3 <Enoch ian S\\\\.aaick As mentioned in Chapter 1, John Dee and Edward Kelley col­laborated at the end of the 16th Century in extensive magical work­ings to establish communication with angels. They succeeded; and from these communications emerged a new system of magick that, in recent centuries, has come to be called Enochian. The Enochian magical system is very extensive. Pieces of it exist in multiple books. (No single book has covered the entire scope of the system.) For the curious, the story of how Dee and Kelley worked is told in many places, such as The Complete Enochian Dictionary by Donald C. Laycock, so there is no need to tell it again here. In this chapter, therefore, we shall focus on a few areas that are immediately relevant to understanding the present book. The Enochian Alphabet Many esoteric alphabets were common in medieval and renais­sance magick. In addition to the Hebrew alphabet, four others are given in Cols. 112-115 of my book 776lh. These, however, were merely ciphers for the Hebrew alphabet. In contrast, Dee and Kelley received an entirely new alphabet, which Dee termed the Angelical Alphabet. (The name \"Enochian\" was more modem.) From this alphabet emerged an entirely new language. Exam­ples will be given later in this chapter, and other brief passages will occur throughout the visions following. The table below gives this Angelical Alphabet with additional information useful in understanding the symbolism of the visions"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"48 Visions & Voices in this book.

It is not necessary that you understand much about ge­omancy per se, merely that it relies on combinations of four binary decisions, such that 16 variations are possible.1 These 16 catego­ries are attributed to planetary and zodiacal symbols through eight pairs of ideas taken as follows: • Two symbols for each of the five planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, according to the two zodiacal signs they rule - one each said to be positive or Diurnal, and the other negative or Nocturnal. For example, the Enochian A is attributed to \"Venus by Night,\" i.e., the \"feminine\" sign Taurus, while the Enochian 0 is attributed to \"Venus by Day,\" i.e., the \"masculine\" sign Libra. • Two symbols each for the Sun and Moon. The positive and negative expressions of the Sun are distinguished by its northern or southern declination; and both are attributed to the one sign ruled by the Sun, Leo. The Moon's two letters are distinguished as to whether the Moon is waxing (in­creasing light) or waning (decreasing light), both of which are attributed to the one sign ruled by the Moon, Cancer. • The final two are the North and South Lunar Nodes, called Caput Draconis (Dragon's Head) and Cauda Draconis (Dragon's Tail). These 16 factors are attributed to 16 of the 21 Enochian letters. The remaining five letters are attributed to the elements. This latter appears to have been an innovation by Crowley,2 and not to have had precedent either in the Golden Dawn or in older manuscripts. Three kinds of irregularities in these attributions have driven students of The Vision & the Voice slightly mad for several dec­ades. It would be better if these were explained at the beginning. Compare the Yi Ching which relies on six binary decisions, such that 64 variations are possible. � Crowley's personal magical notebook, which he used as a working refer­ence for both the 1900 and 1909 vision work, has a table of these attributions on its last pages. The correspondences taught by the Golden Dawn are in one darker ink; corrections and additions were added later in a different pen or pencil. The elemental attributions are all from the later date and followed by a question mark-that is, those attributions were still evolving ideas for him."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"50 Visions & Voices CrazyMaker No.1: The Golden Dawn did not originate these attributions. They derived them from such sources as MS. Harley 6282; and they were not always copied correctly. Specifically, the Golden Dawn switched (presumably inadvertently) the attributions of Gemini and Virgo. Although Crowley's earliest Enochian work (especially the 301h lEthyr) employed the G.D. error, he later cor­rected it, accurately attributing the Enochian E (l) to Virgo and S (l.) to Gemini. 1 But you will, nonetheless, encounter some incon­sistency in his writings on this point. CrazyMaker No. 2: Although Crowley knew the correct at­tribution of the Enochian P (0) to Cancer (Moon waning) and G (Tv) to Leo (Sun in north declination), and evidently had these clearly in mind at the time of receiving the visions published here, he reversed the attributions in his mind at the time of penning his comments. Based on evidence internal to the visions, this most likely was an error and not intentional.2 Therefore, his notes on any rethyr with a G or a P in its name are sometimes misleading. CrazyMaker No.3: Crowley wrote his comments (including astrological glyphs) by hand into his personal copies of THE EQUI­NOX. Apparently he could not tell his own Leo glyph ( &l_) from that of the Dragon's Head (66). So, after he had written his preliminary notes, he confused them. Often he mistook one for the other. This becomes even more confusing since he regarded both, seemingly indifferently, as symbolic of the archetype of the Beast. The astrological correspondences to each letter will be refer­enced frequently throughout the book. The 30 Enochian JEthyrs One important doctrine of Enochian magick (the central matter of the present book) involves 30 rethyrs, or ayres (aires), disclosed to Dee and Kelley by the angels Ile and Gabriel on July 13, 1584. Confirming this initial confusion: Crowley's personal grimoire, mentioned earlier, originally had 1 (E) attributed to Gemini as per the G.D. The Gemini glyph was later over-written with a Virgo glyph, which is correct. This correc­tion evidently occurred sometime later than 1900 and before 1909. 2 However, his notebook does show a ? after the line attributing Sun in north declination to b (G). y.., difti:ttill lk ......

Enochian Magick 51 Two different views exist of these rethyrs. The view that Crowley pursued in the visions before us might be termed the vertical view. That is, it pertains to a hierarchical scale of consciousness. In this view, the 30 rethyrs may be regard­ed as progressively rarefied planes, the densest of which is imme­diately outside the bounds of our material universe. An alternative view might be termed the horizontal. All of its phenomena are on our present plane of awareness. Each rethyr is attributed to some nation or other portion of the earth. For someone as politically connected as Dee, this might have been important. For all we know, he helped Queen Elizabeth repel the Spanish ar­mada by invocations of the 26th JEthyr controlling Hispania. How­ever, if he did, there is no record of it; and, in any case, this use of the rethyrs is not a part of the present book. In the vertical view, the 30 JEthyrs are diagrammed as follows: The physical universe is represented as a cube. Outside this - sur­rounding it and concentric with it - is a sphere constituting the 30th JEthyr called TEX. Surrounding this (and concentric with it) is the 29th, called RII; and so on, until 30 concentric spheres are mapped. These appear to represent 30 progressively subtler realms. Since the densest of the 30 realms is portrayed as outside the whole of our physical universe, we have a starting point for under­standing them. In the language of the Four Qabalistic Worlds, our physical universe is Assiah; therefore, the densest of the 30 JEthyrs exists in the World of Y etzirah. The fact that the three Worlds of Y etzirah, Briah, and Atziluth each contain all ten sephiroth of the Tree of Life did not escape the adepts of the Golden Dawn. They conceived of two 3 x 10 models to map the 30 lEthyrs to the Tree of Life. I have found the first of these models to be enormously valua­ble in understanding Aleister Crowley's visionary experience of the rethyrs. In fact, if he did not consciously apply this model (and there is no evidence that he did), then I must conclude that the model accurately maps the objective nature of the rethyrs. It is simply this: The 30 A:thyrs represent the ten Sephiroth (Malkuth to Kether) in Yetzirah, Briah, and Atziluth. This mapping can be seen in the table on page 53."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"52 Visions & Voices There is another model that was employed by the Second Order of the Golden Dawn, which attributed the ten sephiroth in these three Worlds somewhat differently. It does come into play in these visions, but not significantly until the 9th JEthyr. We shall explore it later, at the point in our story that it becomes relevant. This sephirothic mapping is one of the most important keys to the examination of the symbolism of these rethyrs. Justifiably, some students of The Vision & the Voice may argue that the visions themselves speak against such a model. For exam­ple, in the Vision of the 12th JEthyr, §23 we read: .. .I reveal unto thee a mystery of the JEthyrs, that not only are they bound up with the Sephiroth, but also with the Paths. Now, the plane of the JEthyrs interpenetrateth and surroundeth the universe wherein the Sephiroth are established, and therefore is the order of the JEthyrs not the order of the Tree of Life. And only in a few places do they coincide. In contrast, we find in § 18 of the Vision of the 9th JEthyr: And an Angel cometh forth, . . . and he taketh me aside into a little chamber in one of the nine towers. This chamber is furnished with maps of many mystical cities .... And he points to the map of the JEth­yrs, that are arranged as a flaming Sword, so that the thirty JEthyrs go into the ten Sephiroth .... I feel no need to resolve this matter in these preliminary re­marks. The text of the visions and the nature of the commentary will speak for themselves in this regard. At present I wish only to present the primary model that will be the filter through which I examine the 30 JEthyrs in the pages following. The table below lists the numbers and names of the 30 JEthyrs (including their names written in Enochian characters). Additional­ly, it gives two other important pieces of information. First, the let­ters composing the names of each rethyr (e.g., BAG or V ;\\:) for the 28th) are converted to their astrological correspondences (e.g., Cf'O 62 for BAG). Finally, the Qabalistic correspondence- a par­ticular sephirah in one of the Four Worlds- is given. These are the root Qabalistic ideas necessary for the study before us. .. TEX � ltD ....

It is used to open the 30 lEthyrs. The call is identical for all 30, except that the name of the particular rethyr is substituted in the first line. This means that the 19th Call is really 30 calls in one, and the 19 calls actually constitute 48 calls (18 + 30). Additionally, there is said to be another call preceding the 1st, which is silence. Therefore, there are 49 calls in all. Aleister Crowley used the 19th Call, \"The Call of the 30 lEth­yrs,\" to inaugurate each of these visions. I give it below in three forms: first, the original form of the Call in the Enochian language; second, the Call in the particular Enochian dialect distinctive to the Golden Dawn (and, therefore, that which Crowley learned and ap­parently used); and, finally, its translation in English.

The values of the Hebrew letters are given in the table on pages 27-28. Here are some examples of how gematria works: • The Hebrew words echad (1m�), \"unity,\" and ahabah (il:::lil�), \"love,\" both total to 13. This instructs us that love is unity. • The Greek words 8EAT]jla (thelema) and ayaTTT] (agape) both add to 93. Both are extremely important in the The­lemic scripture The Book of the Law, wherein this relation­ship discloses numerous philosophical mysteries. • The Latin words deus, \"god,\" and homo, \"humanity,\" both total to 45, teaching us that the Divine and human are one. Sometimes, gematria simply discloses instruction intentionally encoded by teachers of the past. Qabalistic magicians typically re­gard that there is also an intrinsic relationship between words hav­ing the same numerical value independent of whether intentional secrets were hidden in them. At an even deeper level, gematria provides an inner language by which its devotees sustain a silent conversation with the Light. 1 The Enochian alphabet may have its own distinctive form of gematria. (It seems that it does.) However, I am not satisfied with how this has been developed in the past. I am proposing a different approach, which is demonstrated throughout this book. In the table on page 48 are given two different sets of numeri­cal values for each Enochian letter. The first (AC) is that which Aleister Crowley used. The second (JAE) is a new approach I am propos mg. In my own case, for example, a preoccupation with gematria gave me an inner code for conversing first with my subconscious mind, and later with the emerging link to my Holy Guardian Angel before the latter became fully con­scious. When direct inner communion with the angel had matured, my heavy reliance on gematria evaporated."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"58 Visions & Voices Crowley's approach: As shown previously, each Enochian letter corresponds to an astrological or Qabalistic idea through as­sociations used in geomancy. For example, the EnochianA (,?)cor­responds to the sign Taurus. To find a numerical value for each letter, Crowley used the following logic: ,? is Taurus. In Qabalah, Taurus is the Hebrew 1 = 6. Therefore, ,? = 6. All of Crowley's personal marginalia and published commen­taries on The Vision & the Voice are based on this approach. Weakness in Crowley's approach: I long suspected that this method was not right. One supreme piece of evidence against it stood out from all others: The name BABALON (the goddess who is so central to these visions) has long been understood to enumerate to 156. Crowley adopted this value early and built substantial doc­trine around it. The value does seem intrinsically connected to the Enochian universe, since much of Enochian magick centers on four elemental tables of 12 x 13 = 156 squares. (See page 311.) In the Second Order of the Golden Dawn, these tablets were created so that each square was a truncated pyramid, and Babalon is called \"Queen of the City of Pyramids\" - which is as much the forest of pyramids on these elemental tablets as anything else. You can read more about the number 156 in Appendix A. Let me truncate this elaboration by saying that I am not the one who spent a lifetime making the point that BABALON = 156; it was Crowley who did this. The problem is that BABALON is an Enochian word. It means \"wicked,\" and is related to the similar Enochian word, BABALOND, \"harlot.\" But it is not in the Enochian mode of enumeration Crow­ley employed that this name enumerates to 156. It is only true in Hebrew (ll7?�J�J) and Greek (Ba�<lAov)! In the Enochian gematria method Crowley used, BABALON (V,?VXl.J) = (f�(f�§.n.m. = 1 � 1 � n ? J = 280. There were other clues pointing in the same direction, other Enochian words that produced beautiful results if treated as if they were Hebrew words, among them the Divine Names IAIDA = 26 and IADNAMAD = 111. Eshelman's approach: It seemed from the above that the cor­rect approach was either (a) a direct analogy to cognate Hebrew or"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"�ly, each Enochian �c idea through as­� EnochianA (;)cor­laical value for each r Taurus.

Neither the Hebrew nor the Greek alphabet would serve by itself; for example, there is no X in Hebrew and no letter for H in Greek, but both exist in Enochian. Starting with as close a fit as possible to the Hebrew, and modifying where neces­sary based on knowledge of the evolution of alphabets, I compiled the values in the table on page 48 and tested them against the names of the rethyrs and the resulting visions. To tum a ten-page report into a few sentences: I tabulated the names of each rethyr by both approaches and compared the numer­ical values to the content of the Crowley's visions. I rated them on a seven-point scale where 0 points were given if I could draw nei­ther a pro nor con conclusion; 1, 2, or 3 points given if the vision and numbers slightly matched, solidly matched, or had (nearly) flawless agreement; and 1, 2, or 3 points subtracted if the compari­son was slightly mismatched, seriously mismatched, or absolutely wrong. The Crowley approach, for all 30 rethyrs, averaged a nonde­script \"slightly matches.\" The new approach, however, averaged +2.5, meaning on the border of \"solidly matches\" and \"nearly flawless.\" Eleven of the 30 (over one-third) were \"nearly flawless\" using the new number scale, and 22 (73%) were \"solidly matched\" or better. In comparison, using Crowley's original method of nu­meration, only two - the 21st and 2nd - appeared \"nearly flawless,\" and only 12 (40%) were \"solidly matched\" or better. Enough of statistics, though! You can draw your own conclu­sions from the discussions that follow. The purpose of this section is to explain what is being used in the analysis. It does appear that there is a valid Enochian gematria, and that it discloses itself in the values of the names of the 30 JEthyrs."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"CFtapter 4 Scr!i\"B in tfte Spirit C{)ision Visions and voices! What are we to expect from such a title? Although \"seeing things and hearing things\" is colloquially equated with psychological aberration, the tradition of mystical vision is deeply rooted in the religious experiences of every inhab­ited continent on Earth. So, for that matter, is the verbal interaction with angelic and other immaterial beings for guidance, instruction, and companionship. These experiences may be either spontaneous or provoked. Such experiences are usually characterized as mystical, espe­cially when they are spontaneous. A vision also is rightly charac­terized as magical if it is produced at will and its theme is inten­tionally selected. Within the magical traditions, especially of Western initiating orders, intentionally engendered and directed vision is an im­portant part of the training. It is perhaps the most important part of the training and practice that opens one from the World of Assi­ah to the World of Y etzirah. It is variously called viewing, scrying, or travelling in the astral, in the fine body, or in the spirit vision. Astral travelling is probably the most misleading term because it wrongly infers that one is going from one place to another. In terms of physical space, this is not so; however, inwardly, psycho­logically, even spiritually, one is most certainly undertaking a pil­gnmage. The term scrying has more advantages. It comes from the same root as scrutiny, and similarly means an active, penetrating search­ing. It is a shortened form of descry, which refers to discovery from careful observation and investigation.

Scrying, thus, is clearly distinguished from passive mediumistic reception. In common usage, scrying refers to some action such as crystal gazing. Crowley used a topaz scrying stone to facilitate his investi­gations of the 30 lEthyrs. However, such devices are only props to help focus the magician's attention. \"Scrying in the Spirit Vision\" actually involves using one's own psyche, or even the broader ex­panse of humanity's collective mind, as the \"crystal ball\" of one's active, penetrating search. This scrying is an induced waking dream. The part of the mind through which one enters the vision is one's personal sub­consciousness, the field of mind wherein dreams occur. Just as with dreams, the distinctive language of these visions, often pecu­liar and haunting to the rational self-conscious mind, has symbols for its \"words.\" Symbols are the units of the distinctive language of subconsciousness. Methods of entering into such an induced dream are many. To the extent they can be learned from a book, they already exist in many a book, so there is no need to reproduce them here. General­ly, this skill is learned best from working one-on-one with some­one experienced in the practice. I will only advise that the gateway skills (and the protocols of personal preparation) are the same as those for deep meditation. The method Crowley learned in the Golden Dawn (and later taught in A:. A:.) added ritual cleansing of the outer (environmental) and inner (psychological) space as a preliminary, and then use of further ritual to strongly energize and direct the psyche before commencing. Because the portal to such vision is one's personal subcon­scious mind, a reasonable question is whether these induced vi­sions are, perhaps, no more than personal psychological experienc­es. If that were the case, they would still be of enormous value for psychological exploration and extending one's active familiarity with normally dormant parts of the mind. However, my experience long ago persuaded me that, if one perseveres, there comes a point where one's inner explorations move past the personal and enter a deep domain of mind shared by all people. Consider the following metaphor:"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"62 Visions & Voices Regard your personal subconsciousness as the water of a cove, initially shallow where it touches the beach, and eventually drop­ping off to greater depths as one moves farther from shore. One moves into the water from the dry land of self-conscious mind, and gradually learns to swim, to be comfortable in the water, to occa­sionally dive deep at progressively greater distances from shore -all within the sheltered nook of the cove. Early scrying is of this type. One is learning to swim around in one's own subconsciousness. This early work has the dual value of strengthening us and familiarizing us with \"swimming\" in such an environment, and giving the opportunity to explore the contents of our own minds. But there is more to the sea than our cove. In time, having be­come strong in such swimming, and having ventured (perhaps many times) to the place where the relatively protected cove opens out into the ocean, we cross the barrier and break into the open sea. These waters are no longer simply our own pond: They are the great sea of consciousness shared by all. The metaphor is simple, though its details match those of the progressive exploration of the depths of our minds and souls. Per­sonal subconsciousness opens unto a collective, or universal, un­consciousness. What began much as a dream has deepened, even­tually penetrating beyond the merely symbolic to the archetypal; yet the passage is always through one's own personal access por­tal, which is one's personal subconscious mind. Learning this \"astral journeying\" is also the opening of con­scious awareness to the World of Y etzirah. At least, that is where it begins.

I held this as a rule in my hand. After choosing a spot where I was not likely to be dis­turbed, I would take this stone and recite the Enochian Key, 1 and, after satisfying myself that the invoked forces were actually present, made the topaz play a part not unlike that of the looking-glass in the case of Alice. I learned not to trouble myself to travel to any desired place in the astral body. I realized that space was not a thing in itself, merely a con­venient category (one of many such) by reference to which we can dis­tinguish objects from each other. When I say I was in any JEthyr, I simply mean in the state characteristic of, and peculiar to, its nature. My senses would then receive the subtle impressions' which I had trained them to record, so becoming cognizant of the phenomenon of these worlds as ordinary men are of this. I would describe what I saw and repeat what I heard and Frater O.V. [Victor Neuburg] would write down my words and incidentally observe any phenomena which struck him as peculiar. Crowley was working under one particular limitation as he moved deeper into these visions: He was committed to bringing back a record that would serve others as a map of the terrain. Many of these visions would have taken him deeper than Y etzirah, well into the World of Briah and even further; but, had he permitted his (by then considerable) mystical experience to take him into these deepest trenches of the Great Sea, expressible language and trans­missible imagery would have dissolved. Only in the 1oth JEthyr, and perhaps the 2nd, did he permit himself this freedom. In the oth­ers, rather than dive deep, he mostly remained abstracted from the rethyr, acting as an observer. For example, from the 20th JEthyr: This vision is not perfect. I am only in the outer court of the vision, be­cause I have undertaken it in the service of the Holy One, and must re­tain sense and speech. No recorded vision is perfect, of high visions, for the seer must keep either his physical organs or his memory in working order. And neither is capable. There is no bridge. One can only be con­scious of one thing at a time, and as the consciousness moves nearer to the vision, it loses control of the physical and mental. Even so, the body and the mind must be very perfect before anything can be done, or the energy of the vision may send the body into spasms and the mind into insanity. This is why the first visions give Ananda, which is a shock. When the adept is attuned to Samadhi, there is but cloudless peace. See \"The Call of the 30 JEthyrs\" in the previous chapter."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"64 Visions & Voices And, in the Vision of the 18th JEthyr: I wanted to go back to the King's Chamber. The Angel pushed me away, saying: \"Thou shalt see these visions from afar off, but thou shalt not partake of them save in the manner prescribed .... \" Factors Affecting the Visions For me, the most exciting aspect of this study is the opportunity to distinguish between the numerous factors that contribute to the nature of the visions received. In particular, we have the opportuni­ty (with a generous data sample) to observe the relationship be­tween astrology and ceremonial magick. Astrologers have the opportunity to see what astrological fac­tors impact subconscious content and the ideas and images that arise therefrom. This could be of enormous value - truly enor­mous! -in the application of astrology for psychological explora­tion and healing. Magicians will gain from this examination in two ways. First, we acquire a better understanding of the nature and scope of astro­logical impact on any magical undertaking. This is quite practical. Magical ceremonies and astral explorations are ideally undertaken with consideration of the astrological environment at the time of the operation, and The Vision & the Voice gives us extensive op­portunity to learn more about this. Second, by peeling away the various factors that affect the contents of an astral vision (and of these astral visions in particular), we are better able to distinguish what, if anything, is inherent in the domain of the vision itself. This is the alchemical solve phase, in which a complex \"first mat­ter\" (or raw, natural object) is broken into its component parts so that extraneous foreign matter can be filtered away. As we go rethyr by rethyr through the series, we will see and analyze many factors that condition the final form of each vision. Intrinsic Nature of the lEthyrs One contributing factor, of course, is the intrinsic nature of each of the 30 lEthyrs.

If ex­isting, these should be substantially the same for each person ex­ploring the rethyrs by comparable means, allowances necessarily being made for the differences in each witness.1 These intrinsic elements, according to present theory, should be reflected (a) in the symbolism of the letters composing the name of each rethyr; (/3) in the correspondences of the rethyrs to the sephiroth in the three nonmaterial Worlds; and, to a certain extent, (y) in the pure sequencing of the rethyrs. There may also be other factors not yet recognized or understood. Planets on the Angles In magical theory, as in my experience, the astrological pattern at the time of a scrying conditions the ambient astral environment. That is, \"journeys\" undertaken to any part of the astral plane (World ofYetzirah) are affected and modified by the strongest as­trological factors then prevailing? It is in Y etzirah that astrological forces have their most direct and pronounced effects, precipitating into material circumstances as a consequence thereof. Planets crossing the horoscopic angles -the horizon and meridian -are among the very strongest astrologi­cal factors, and the most influential on rapidly shifting Y etziratic tides: On average, the meridian (MC and IC) and horizon (Ascend­ant and Descendant) change 1 o every four minutes of time, or about 15° per hour. At the rising of Mars (for example), any vision, even one of Venus or Jupiter, would be expected to have something of a mar­tial quality simply because the tone of the Y etziratic \"environ­ment\" would be markedly expressive of the qualities of Mars. Eve-Two people vacationing in the same foreign city will have quite distinctive experiences. Depending on where and when they travel, what choices they make, their initial goals and expectations for the trip, and how their personalities react to different settings and circumstances, their experiences may seem almost umelated. However, this does not deny the objective reality of the city. 2 This applies to ceremonial magical workings also, because they either are undertaken in, or pass through, the same astral environment."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"66 Visions & Voices ryone' s personal subconscious mind, at the time Mars was rising, would be strongly skewed toward a martial tone. This conditioning of the \"ambient astral\" is a most fascinating topic. Anyone already familiar with The Vision & the Voice will recall that many of the visions start or end with some imagery that seems foreign to the rest of the vision. These passing images re­mind me of \"flipping through the channels\" on a television while settling onto the program you want to watch. In most cases, this preliminary or concluding \"static\" has nothing to do with the target cethyr, but, rather, is a mark of Crowley's mind reflecting the gen­eral astral tone at the time of the vision. This is valuable stuffl We can learn much from examining it. Angles Defined The angles of a horoscope are the horizon and meridian of a specific location at a specific time. These are the strongest, most expressive positions for a planet. All planets cross each of the an­gles once every day. The horizon, casually speaking, is the boundary between earth and sky.1 Astrologers call the eastern half of the horizon (where planets and stars rise) the Ascendant. It is generally shown at the far left of a horoscope (the \"9 o'clock\" position on the wheel). The western half of the horizon (where planets set), exactly opposite the Ascendant, is called the Descendant. The meridian is a circle passing directly over our heads and under our feet, crossing the horizon due north and south. That half which splits the daytime sky (the place of the Sun at sundial noon) is called the Midheaven (MC). The other half, which divides the nocturnal sky (the place of the Sun at true midnight), is called the Lower Heaven (IC). These are generally shown at the top and bot­tom of a horoscope diagram (the \"12 o'clock\" and \"6 o'clock\" po­sitions), respectively. The Ascendant and Midheaven are the two strongest angles of a horoscope. The Descendant and Lower Heaven are less strong. More technical definitions of these astronomical and astrological terms can be found in the Glossary. The purpose here is to give a general idea."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"lac Mars was rising, IC. � a most fascinating 1M & the Voice will �some imagery that i= passing images re­• a television while �In most cases, this ftlo do with the target .. reflecting the gen-1¥ lium examining it. � �. • and meridian of a 5:tbe strongest, most � each of the an-��': . ._..,.r., between earth the horizon (where lly shown at the on the wheel).

The two points 90° from the horizon (in astrological language, the upper and lower squares to the Ascendant) are called the Zen­ith and Nadir. These are the actual longitudes of the highest and lowest points in the sky, respectively.1 Similarly, important secondary angles are formed by the points square the Midheaven. However, these are measured not along the ecliptic, but along the celestial equator. The point 90° east of the Midheaven along the equator is called the Eastpoint. It marks the intersection of three measurement circles, the horizon, celestial equator, and prime vertical. The point opposite the Eastpoint is, predictably, called the Westpoint . Angles Applied Planets on angles when Crowley began each vision prove to be quite significant. In most cases, such a planet meaningfully charac­terized the tone or theme of the vision. Usually, the angular planets described the overall tone or theme; but, sometimes they only described the early moments of a vision, as if portraying a street scene encountered outside of a building before entering. Although the astrological conditions at the time a vision begins do usually set the tone for the whole vision (being part of the \"set and setting\" carried into the experience), the moment of beginning does not appear to be what astrologers call radical. That is, it is not a true \"birth moment\" like a person's birth, forming a corpora­tion, starting a job, getting married, or other decisive starting points. Instead, evolving astral conditions result from the continu­ing change of planetary angularity as the vision progresses, as new planets rise, culminate, &c. during the hour or two of a vision. (These changing conditions are mentioned in my commentaries.) Of the 35 visions included in this book, no date or time was given for two of them, and four had no planets on angles at their Astrologers sometimes mistakenly say \"Zenith\" and \"Nadir\" when they mean \"MC\" and \"IC.\""},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"68 Visions & Voices start. This leaves 29 visions beginning with one or more planets on the angles. Of these 29, in ten cases the symbolism of the angular planets matches content of the visions so closely as to be rated \"nearly flawless.\" In another 11, the match of the vision themes to its angular planets was \"solid.\" When I quantified these scores, the 29 visions overall averaged a \"solid\" match to the angular planets. Readers may want to study these visions grouped according to which planets were angular at their start. Here are a few notes based on the planets closest to the angles for each vision. THE SUN AND MERCURY were angular for the 22nd, 16th, and 1ih .tEthyrs. Of these, the 12th was so overwhelmed by the rising Moon and other Cancer symbolism that the solar and mercurial symbolism was all but lost. The other two .ethyrs displayed deci­sive solar themes, and to a lesser extent mercurial themes, that can be identified easily by reading the visions. (The Sun and Mercury were only angular together.) THE MOON was angular at the start of the 1ih and 3rd .tEthyrs, and parts 2 and 3 of the 2nd .tEthyr. For all but the 12th, Venus was also angular. In all four cases there were pronounced feminine themes. For the 12th, Cancer themes are indicated by so many dif­ferent factors, that it is hard to give the angular Moon full credit; nonetheless, the symbolism fits. The two parts of the 2nd .tEthyr had pronounced feminine themes, including Part 3 where Crowley ex­perienced the full Vision of Babalon. The 3rd .tEthyr is a stranger case: It was primarily a vision of Mercury (an idea intrinsic to the .ethyr itself), but included a perverse, degenerate expression of the feminine as one major theme. In that instance, the Moon was in Sidereal Capricorn, the sign of her detriment. VENUS was angular most often of all planets during these vi­sions. She was close to one of the angles about half the time, in 14 instances: the 28th' 2ih, 15th, and ih (with Uranus and Neptune), all of which had a pronounced goddess theme; the three mentioned above when the Moon also was angular; and the 20th, 14th (Part 1), 13th, 5th (Part 2), and all four parts of the 2nd .tEthyr. In fact, Venus was angular at the start of every vision from the 5th .tEthyr on, ex­cept for the 1st, including all four parts of the important 2nd .tEthyr which was the final revelation of the unambiguously Venus-like ........ s 8abalma.

In each of these visions except the very brief Part 1 of the 14th .tEthyr, Venus themes were decisively present. MARS was angular four times, in the 26th, 21st, 8th' and 5th (Part 1) .tEthyrs. The 21st was a dead note for Mars, other factors over­whelming it. Similarly, the 5th was unimpressive. (In both of these instances, Mars' Qabalistic antithesis, Jupiter, was also angular.) But the 26th is marked by blood, war, and woe, while the 8th was quite strenuous and taxing. Closer examination of these four reth­yrs may disclose other commonalities not yet detected. JUPITER was angular four times. Of these, the 21st and the 5th (Part 1) he shared with Mars as mentioned above, and no striking effect was noticed. But the 24th and 20th .tEthyrs were flawless symbolic matches to Jupiter, the former being entirely dominated by Jupiter themes of Chesed and Samekh (X\"), and the latter being a vision of Jupiter's letter, Kaph. SATURN was angular six times. Of these, the 25th showed no particular satumian significance except for the stem figure at the end, and the intense 18th had so much going on that any Saturn themes were but garnish. But the 28th, 13th, lOth, and 6th have pro­nounced Saturn themes and characteristics. URANUS AND NEPTUNE were opposite each other for all but the first two of these visions, and therefore were only angular together. They were close to the angles eight times, and, except for the 23rd and, perhaps, the Venus-overwhelmed 7th, each of these visions was marked by breakthroughs and conscious alteration of unusual intensity. See the 28th, 27th, 18th, 15th, 8th, and 1st .tEthyrs. PLUTO was only angular for the 26th .tEthyr. As a vision of transformative breakthrough (which Crowley later termed a vision of Kether, appropriate for Pluto), this solitary hit was clean. The Moon's Sign The Moon's sign, changing (on average) every two and a half days, markedly characterizes these visions. The Moon is especially linked to psychological, astral, and visionary matter. Having looked at the evidence in these visions, I assert that the Sidereal constellation of the Moon describes the actual contents of the visions much better than the Tropical. The results are dramatic."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"70 Visions & Voices For each vision, two horoscopes are given: one in the Tropical Zodiac and one in the Sidereal Zodiac. The horoscopes are, in all other respects, identical. I believe the data generally speak for themselves. Nonetheless, by presenting both versions of the horo­scopes, readers will be able to draw their own conclusions. If you are not aware that there are two primary theories of the zodiac, this book will be real eye opener in that regard! As men­tioned earlier, Appendix D provides an explanation of the differ­ences between the Tropical and Sidereal zodiacs, and the main case for the Sidereal. To summarize briefly: Of the two competing theories of the nature and boundaries of the zodiac, the more popu­lar in the West, for approximately the last thousand years, is called the Tropical Zodiac. It fixes the start of Aries at the place of the March Equinox. The Sidereal Zodiac was the only zodiac that ex­isted, in every culture on Earth, during the first two to three mil­lennia of astrology's four to five thousand year known history, and, in slightly different forms, is still the preferred zodiac in India. It was also one of the esoteric secrets of the Second Order of the Golden Dawn, although its proponent, MacGregor Mathers, was 5° off on his calculation of its boundaries. In looking at a Tropical and a Sidereal horoscope for the same moment and place, what one will first notice, for 20th Century charts, is that about 80% of the time a planet will appear one sign earlier in the Sidereal chart than it will in the Tropical. If you are not familiar with all of this, please read Appendix D. Unfortunately, the question, \"Do the images and ideas that arise in each vision match the symbolism of the concurrent Moon­sign?\" is inherently subjective. Symbols are the language of sub­consciousness and never entirely reducible to nonporous rational labels. However, we can increase the objectivity of our conclusions by scoring the Moon-sign contribution of each vision and examin­ing the entire pattern of all the rethyrs. This will filter out any tendencies to be so impressed with a few examples that we lose perspective on the whole. Therefore, as with the two models of Enochian gematria in Chapter 3, for each rethyr where a date and time are recorded, I rated the descriptive accuracy of (a) the Sidereal Moon-sign and"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"j.at: one in the Tropical � horoscopes are, in all 11m generally speak for ..._ versions of the horo­Ml conclusions. � pimary theories of the lila that regard!

Again, I used a seven-point scale where 0 points were given if I could draw neither a pro nor con conclusion; 1, 2, or 3 points given if the vision and Moon-sign slightly matched, solidly matched, or had (nearly) flawless agreement; and 1, 2, or 3 points subtracted if the comparison was slightly mis­matched, seriously mismatched, or absolutely wrong. Of the 33 discrete vision occasions for which time and date were provided, the Sidereal Moon-sign averaged a score of +2 (solidly accurate). The Tropical Moon-sign averaged a score ofO. Ten of the 33 (almost one-third) were \"nearly flawless\" for the Sidereal Moon-sign, and 21 (63%) were \"solidly matched\" or bet­ter. In comparison, using the Tropical Zodiac, there were no in­stances where the symbolism appeared \"nearly flawless,\" and only seven (21 %) were it was deemed \"solid.\" In seven of these visions, the Moon was in the same sign in the two zodiacs. This leaves 26 vision occasions where the Moon was in different signs, and we can compare them. In four instances (15%), neither appeared better than the other. (In two of those four instances, the 20th and 8th LEthyrs, the Moon-sign did not appear to have any discernible impact on the vision.) In 21 instances (89%) the Sidereal Zodiac had better symbolism than the Tropical. In the remaining one instance (4%), Part 2 of the 14th LEthyr, the Tropical Zodiac had better symbolism than the Sidereal. Furthermore, in ten of these 26 instances, the Sidereal Zodiac appeared to be \"unquestionably superior\" - maximum points. These were the 26th 23 rd 21st 9th 7th 4th d 3rd JCth 1 b th , , , , , , an n::, yrs, p us o parts of the 5th and Part 4 of the 2nd. In another six instances, the Sidereal advantage was \"solid.\" These are remarkable numbers. They endorse the conclusion that the Sidereal constellation of the Moon describes the actual contents of the visions very well (much better than the Tropical), and that the differences are dramatic. The Sun's Sign The Sun moves too slowly for its sign position to have a radical impact on rapidly changing currents. Initially, therefore, I expected"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"72 Visions & Voices to see no particular significance from the Sun's sign placement. That expectation was shortsighted. In the Sidereal Zodiac, the solar sign placement was remarka­ble. In all of the visions from the 28th JEthyr through the 5th, the Sun was in Sidereal Scorpio. Scorpionic themes dominate the vi­sions. These themes include, for example, the incestuous intertwin­ing of sexuality, death, and transformation. The entire course of the visions is aimed at Crowley's assimilation unto Babalon, who is a divine personification of the slaying, devouring, transform­ing, sexual, serpentine qualities of Scorpio. If confirmed by other records, these observations suggest that the Sidereal sign-placement of the Sun at the time of astral scrying or other Y etziratic exploration does contribute to the nature and content of the visions. For comparison, in all of the visions from the 28th JEthyr through the 5th the Sun was in Tropical Sagittarius. Besides fairly vague associations (spiritual aspiration, physical and psychological journeying), there is no general Sagittarian theme winding through these visions the way that there are obviously Scorpionic themes. Lunar Phase The lunar phase conditions the amount of magical vitality available to the operator. We can observe these surging and retreat­ing tides through the course of the visions. Both instinctual and magical energies increase (as if tumescing) in the two weeks from New Moon to Full Moon, and drop off during the two weeks from Full Moon to New Moon. Though the New Moon can serve as a time to initiate new things, its energies remain weak. Powerful re­flections of magical light into the human psyche occur at Full Moon, and then drop off soon after. The second week of the month (1st Quarter to Full Moon) is the most dynamic, though the whole time from New to Full is marked by increasing vitality and light. The two or three days just before New Moon are traditionally the most destructive. However, experience does not show these energies to be inherently inimical. Rather, they are wild, instinctu­al, difficult to control, and inclined toward elimination and even disintegration. ... 'Illes..�."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"�.,s sign placement.

In either case, the sim­plest metaphor is that the greatest amount of pure Light is reflected into the soul, even as the Moon then reflects the greatest amount of sunlight. The Sun's Seasonal Phase There is another solar pattern based on the annual ebb and flow of reciprocal currents of Light and Night streaming through the cycle of seasons. I expected this to produce recognizable results in this vision series and, in fact, it did. Tropical astrologers may wonder why I distinguish this sea­sonal phase from the Sun's passage through the signs of the Trop­ical Zodiac, which, after all, is based on the same framework of equinoxes and solstices. One reason for this distinction is that the characteristics of the seasonal tides do not match the characteristics of the corresponding twelve signs. Additionally, the seasonal tides flow in opposite directions north and south of the equator. The pattern which has elaborated these annual seasonal rhythms most meaningfully is found within the Chinese system of divination, the Yi Ching, or \"Book of Changes.\" Twelve of the 64 hexagrams of Yi Ching are attributed to the 12 months of the Chi­nese year. (The whole pattern is displayed in Chapter 16 of my book, 776�.) These 12 hexagrams show a gradual change from a hexagram made of all \"light\" (unbroken) lines leading up to the summer solstice; then a gradual rising and replacement of \"dark\" (broken) lines leading to the threshold of the winter solstice; and then a gradual return of the light from that point until its fullness at summer solstice. At the equinoxes the light and dark are in perfect balance. All of the visions from the 28th LE:thyr to the 1st occurred in the last month of autumn - the month leading right up to winter solstice. (The final vision occurred on the = : evening of December 20.) This month corresponds to = = Hexagram #2 called \"The Receptive,\" consisting of = = all dark or Yin (feminine) lines.

One might well call it the \"victory of the feminine.\" As study of these visions will show, this is an accurate description of the tone and content of the VISIOnS. Other Astrological Factors While the foregoing factors will be the most important for us to observe in examining the horoscopes of each vision, other general astrological elements, such as exact aspects on the day of a vision, also will be examined for their contribution. These do not occur consistently enough to be rated like other factors above, but are examined instance-by-instance as they occur. A similar astrological consideration is the effects of transits to Crowley's own horoscope at the time of each vision. These have identifiable effect in most cases, though rarely as strong an effect as other considerations such as angular planets, the Moon's sign and phase, &c. An exception is the on-going Uranus-Neptune op­position squaring Crowley's natal Sun that runs throughout the en­tire series of visions beginning with the 28th. The Neptune-then­Uranus tag-team rhythms, surging and receding in the proximity of their exact aspects, is a major theme of the story before us."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"lam of an inward turn­*-One might well call J of these visions will J4one and content of the � important for us to kJa vision, other general f oo the day of a vision, � These do not occur , factors above, but are � 111e effects of transits to � vision.

The first was its publication in THE EQUINOX No. 5 one hundred years ago, in 1911. At various later dates, Crowley penned two sets of notes that form an important commentary on the contents of these visions. These were posthumously incorporated into the original work as footnotes in a new edition of The Vision & the Voice published by Karl Germer (Hampton, NJ: Thelema Publishing Co., October 12, 1952).1 Germer included an Introduction written in February 1929, by a mysterious \"Frater E :. N :. L :. \"-who, it was later disclosed, was young Isrrel Regardie, using the motto he had taken as a Pro­bationer of A:. A:. while he lived with Crowley and served as his secretary. Regardie himself later edited and had published the third major edition of The Vision & the Voice, again including Crowley's commentary as footnotes (Dallas: Sangreal Foundation, 1972). It was his edition which truly made the material accessible to a large audience for the first time. Its unique strengths and weaknesses lay in the same feature of the book: Regardie's substantial enrichment of Crowley's notes with his own deep knowledge of the Golden Dawn tradition that is essential to understanding them.

The present book, now in your hands, is based on a pilot study of the astrological and Qabalistic elements of the visions that I wrote between 1996 and 2001 for BLACK PEARL, the journal of College of The lema I then edited.1 It strives to examine the original material to learn further things. Given the ready availability of Crowley's annotations of these visions, there is a need to neither repeat them, nor even substantially review them, except where they are immediately relevant to the further discussion offered here. My primary source for the text of The Vision & the Voice has been THE EQUINOX No. 5. This original publication has been fol­lowed faithfully, apart from typographical corrections, with the following exceptions: Paragraphs have been numbered, according to traditional style for such works, to make referencing them easier in the commentary. Occasionally, the text has been conformed to the original record of the visions, taken down in Victor Neuburg's rushed and frenetic hand. (However, the published version in THE EQUINOX is quite faithful to Neuburg's record, almost to a fault, so few such adjustments were required.)

This is especially recommended if you are not already familiar with The Vision & the Voice. Get the big view of each vi­sion before you join me in tearing it apart on a second reading. The text of the original vision is distinguished from its commentary by being printed in 12 pt. Berlin Sans FB. The commentary is printed in 11 pt. Times New Roman. Second, I recommend that you read the vision aloud. This has a powerful effect. Among other things, it will help convey the mental and emotional tone of the original visionary experience. The record we have of all of the visions from the 28th lEthyr to the 1st were written down from Crowley's verbal recitation to Neu­burg. Reading them aloud will help convey the passion and vibran­cy of the original (and also help you detect the places where Crow­ley temporarily wandered off into dense mental brain-loops). It brings your body and your breath into the process, and joins you more closely to the rhythm and tone of the original experience. While you are reading the visions (whether silently or aloud), be sure to visualize the scenes that are described. These recorded experiences are at least as much vision as voice - so, until we can talk a major animation house into rendering them into a feature film, use your visual imagination to enjoy the full impact of these extraordinary reports. (Remember: Visualizing these experiences while contemplating the ideas communicated will actively employ parts of your brain that you may not be accustomed to using. This turns reading the book into an actual revelatory initiation.) You also may wish to prime your subconsciousness by ex­posing it to the symbols that compose each rethyr idea through the Tarot images corresponding to the Enochian letters composing each rethyr's name. Though any quality Tarot deck will be useful, I recommend you get the Thoth Tarot Deck painted by Frieda Harris in collaboration with Aleister Crowley, based substantially on im­ages drawn directly from The Vision & the Voice.

Whether you approach this work primarily from an astrolog­ical or Qabalistic perspective, there are many technical terms you may not know. I have endeavored to provide a reference that will lead you in exactly the right line of thought for how each word is used in this book. \"There is a light so strenuous ... \" One hundred years ago, in March 1911, The Vision & the Voice was first published, as a special supplement to THE EQUINOX No . 5. With this present volume, I seek to honor the book and its cen­tennial, but not as a curio of history. Rather, I present to you The Vision & the Voice as very much a living work, its value increasing with each passing generation. Consider: Despite the careful recording of the date, time, and place of these visions, it was nearly a century before these basic data were tapped by an astrologer to see what new things could be learned. And a very great deal was learned by doing it! What else lies untapped in this work? I have no doubt that there is quite a lot, and that future generations will uncover it. Each generation bears a duty to its legacies. That duty is partly one of preservation and commemoration, and partly one of build­ing further on the existing foundation. We live in a time when vi­sion is tepid and parochial, and voices are too little raised. We need new vision and new voices, keener reasoning and irrepressible pas­sion, deeper community and more faithful individuality. We need to feed and fortify any who would be more wholly and truly themselves in every respect, pursuing a path of vivid aliveness in Nephesh, Ruach, and Neshamah; that is, in their in­stinctual and biological vitality, their self-conscious reason, and their spiritual fulfillment.

But philosophy, however interesting and intriguing, only finds its value if it delivers a transformative impact to the philosopher. At the beginning of this book, I mentioned several reasons why I believe this present work is important. To me, the most important is that its words are carriers of a contagion of enlightenment. By sympathy they can ignite higher and more radical modes of con­sciousness that are natural (but normally unawakened) states of the human condition.

Nor do we have an ex­act location. There are conflicting reports on even the month when this work was undertaken. A note preceding the Cry of the 28th lEthyr states that Frater Perdurabo received them sometime in Au­gust 1900. However, the date November 17, 1900 is written at the end of the Vision of the 29th lEthyr; and in Chapter 66 of The Con­fessions of Aleister Crowley, he wrote that these visions were ob­tained on November 14 and 17, 1900 while he was visiting Mexi­co. The latter are probably the correct dates; but I think we have to respect the uncertainty. There are, however, a few astrological observations that we can make based only on the known range of possible dates. For the entire last half of 1900, transiting Pluto was 45° (semi­square aspect) from Aleister Crowley's natal Neptune. This transit indicates a renovation of philosophical and cultural attitudes. Dur­ing its operation, beliefs, biases, prejudices, illusions, and personal myths are challenged. The individual is confronted with a new vi­sion of reality. We can see the beginning of this process in Crow­ley with these two visions: As he summarized in his Confessions years later:"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"84 Visions & Voices What I saw was not beyond my previous experience, but what I heard was as unintelligible to me as Blake to a Baptist. Also, during most of this time, transiting Neptune was 135° (sesqui-square aspect) from Crowley's Mercury; and on Novem­ber 17, it was exactly in this aspect to the minute of arc. Under this transit, imagination and sensation boggle the intellect. Com­munication and perceptual confusion are likely, from acutely heightened senses. Fantasy blurs with fact. Judgment errors, poor logic, and misplaced emphasis are increasingly likely. At the same time, it may incline to a more mystical perspective wherein imagi­nation, intuition, and psychic sensitivity flourish. Crowley had a further astrological indication that something extraordinary was going to happen in November 1900 that, to some extent, would remap his experience of reality. His Secondary Progressed Moon was within 1 o of square to progressed Pluto (and, thereafter, would square his natal Pluto in late December). Moon-Pluto progressions are characterized by existential confron­tations, reframing of subconscious content, an urge to flee familiar (physical or psychological) surroundings, and confrontations that often are separative. I think it important to observe the convergence, within Crowley at this juncture, of personal and collective currents of change. We each are primed (in our own unique time) for apocalypse within our own souls; and Crowley's readiness for this in November 1900 is marked by Pluto's transit to his natal Neptune and his pro­gressed Moon-Pluto square. He was less than ten months past his initiation to the important 5=6 (Adeptus Minor) grade of the Order of the Golden Dawn, 1 an initiation that unlocks the sepulchers of subconsciousness and unleashes symbols of transformation housed therein. On the other hand, these visions were undertaken less than sev­en weeks before the start of the 20th Century. Consider (from more recent memory) the mass psychological tone as the 21st Century approached. In 1900, the fin de siecle mindset in Europe was one of great expectation, of both hope and anxiety. (This, even without the foreknowledge that Queen Victoria's 63-year reign would end before the new century was a month old.)

Crowley would, himself, receive the revelation of just such an ceonic transition a mere 40 months after these first two visions were obtained. Therefore, in both his own psyche and the greater mind of the world about him, in November 1900 Aleister Crowley was primed for a message - be it dream, recognition, or precognition - that the hope of catastrophic revelation and reformation lay just ahead. One consequence of this convergence of personal and collec­tive streams of readiness for change is that it is impossible to dis­criminate which of these visionary portents were the ripe fruit of Crowley's own subconscious orchard, and which were symptoms of the times. Some have claimed that these early, primitive visions are prophetic communications from inner guides who later would anoint Crowley prophet of a New .tEon. One could argue just as easily that they are entirely the outworking of his personal psyche. My view lies somewhere between the two, in the thought that Crowley's own spiritual momentum was carrying him in the same direction as the collective stream. This leads us to the Qabalistic examination of this first vision. Using the geomantic correspondences to the Enochian letters given on page 48, the name TEX, /lr, is equivalent to Dragon's Head, Virgo, Earth. By the method of enumerating the letters in­troduced in Chapter 3, TEX = 9 + 8 + 400 = 417, which contrib­utes nothing of real significance. The quality of these earliest visions is unexceptional. Crowley had some prior experience in astral scrying which put him past the greenhorn stage, but his visions in 1900 still had the stiffness and rigor of the beginner. There are technical errors. Yet, even then (in §5, for example) the real symbols tended to fight their way out from under the error and push their way into his stream of con­sciousness. These three dozen visions improve in quality and au­thenticity as they progress, both as he grows in his own spiritual understanding, and as he progresses from the 30th to the 181• It would be an error to place too much emphasis on the details of what he received in these earliest visions; but the underlying mes­sage is fairly consistent with everything else that comes later. One example of a technical error was not Crowley's fault, but nonetheless impacted his vision. In the system of attributions"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"86 Visions & Voices Crowley learned in the R.R. et A.C. Gust a few months earlier), the Enochian letter E (!) was mistakenly attributed to Gemini in­stead of Virgo. This misattribution becomes relevant, for example, in understanding §6 and §24. According to the traditional model described in the Introduc­tion, the 30th lEthyr corresponds to Malkuth in Yetzirah. It is easy to view the present vision through that symbolic window. 1. I am in a vast crystal cube in the form of the Great God Har­pocrates. This cube is surrounded by a sphere. About me are four archangels in blacl:? robes, their wings and armour lined out in white. Immediately, the vision has the form and tone of a classic ritual of initiation, much like the ones that Crowley had experienced in the Golden Dawn. The Enochian model of the 30 LEthyrs portrays our physical universe as a cube. (So much for angelic physics!) About this cube, the model says, are 30 vast concentric spheres, the innermost of which is the 30th lEthyr, TEX, and the outermost of which is the I st JEthyr, LIL. Therefore, in this vision the magician is seen standing at the threshold of the rethyric realm. The particular style of portraying the cube and its four angels is also very appropriate for the expected Malkuth correspondence of this particular rethyr. Malkuth is the field of the four elements, commonly deployed cruciform at the quarters. 1 If only the 30th LEthyr's intrinsic structure were under consider­ation, we would have expected him to be outside the cube, within the first surrounding concentric sphere, perhaps with the cube of our physical universe at its center; but that is not what he encoun­tered. Instead, the Malkuth symbolism prevails: the images are distinctly consistent with it (e.g., both the four-fold, cruciform pat­tern and the color black). Harpocrates' image is especially interesting. His name was the password for the first initiation Crowley received in the Golden Dawn. He is the center of the four archangels. Cf Liber L., 2:49. 1 It is simultaneously attributed distinctly to the element Earth; i.e., it grounds us in the idea of the four elements within the field of our physical senses, paving the way to a larger scope in which physical sensation is just one aspect of our experience."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"• a few months earlier), �Btributed to Gemini in­lies relevant, for example, � �bed in the Introduc-,...... in Yetzirah.

When Crowley, as a candidate to initiation in the Golden Dawn, was first placed in the northern quarter of the temple, it symbol­ized \"the place of greatest darkness.\" It was the start of a triple cir­cling designed to bring him \"from darkness into light.\" This refers to the infernal darkness, the relative ignorance of the uninitiated. It should not be confused with that other darkness which plays so important a role in this present book: the darkness of the unknown into which we penetrate even after being brought to a state of illumination. In the beginning, it is our simple igno­rance, the blinding of being limited to our physical senses, our bio­logical mortality, and wrong ideas about reality. But even here we are given hints at something greater and deeper. The four Enochian characters on the front and back of the northern book are the letters AMBZ. Enumerated as if they were Hebrew, these are l:::lr.JN =50. This is the value ofthe Hebrew let­ter Nun, J (which actually serves as the numeral 50 in Hebrew). Nun is the letter attributed to Scorpio and the XIIIth Atu of Tarot, called Death. Superficially, the card refers to physical death. More deeply it refers to ongoing processes of change and regeneration within us, both biological and psychological. Even more deeply, Nun and 50 hint at the sephirah Binah, which is the main subject of this whole series of visions, because Binah is said to be accessed through 50 Gates. The number of gates is surely a hint that the experience of attaining to Binah has certain analogies to physical death. Additionally, this northern angel appears to me to have a spe­cial relationship to our biological and instinctual aspects. In fact, the first three angels (in the north, east, and south) appear to be addressing the three primary divisions of the human psyche: re­spectively, Nephesh (subconsciousness), Ruach (ego-conscious­ness), and Neshamah (superconsciousness). It was routine, in the various initiation ceremonies which Crowley had experienced in the Golden Dawn, to confront and be taught by three officers ad­dressing these three aspects of consciousness, and then receive a fourth teaching synthesizing them. That appears to be what is hap­pening in this vision as well. The first message, then-summarized in all the lessons of Nun, J, Scorpio, Death - is an instruction to subconsciousness. The message is encoded in the Enochian letters for A, M, B, and Z."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"88 Visions & Voices These letters correspond to the zodiacal signs Taurus, Aquarius, Aries, and Leo. It may have been a message distinctive to Crow­ley at that juncture, or a universal message for all of us. Rather than attempt to interpret it, I will give the method that initiates would use to extract its meaning (which is specifically a method of employing and instructing subconsciousness): Lay out before you (left to right) the four Tarot trumps called The Hierophant, The Star, The Emperor, and Lust (in earlier Tarot decks called \"Strength\"). Meditate upon these by becoming physically and mentally still and directing your attention to each card in tum, let­ting the images speak to you. Anticipate that you will receive in­struction relevant to your needs. Write down what you get. 3. Within it is written: 4. I AM, the surrounding of the four. The Voice of this instruction is represented as the rethyr itself. Remember that the 30th .tEthyr is represented by a sphere com­pletely surrounding, and concentric with, a cube representing our physical universe, \"the surrounding of the four.\" Notice that the two central letters of the book's title (corresponding to The Star and The Emperor) also affirm the celestial sphere surrounding a cubical, rational reality. 5. Lift up your heads, 0 Houses of Eternity: for my Father goeth forth to judge the World. One Light, let it become a thousand, and one sword ten thousand, that no man hide him from my Fa­ther's eye in the Day of Judgment of my Cod. Let the Cods hide themselves: let the Angels be troubled and flee away: for the Eye of My Father is open, and the Boot? of the IEons is fallen. Crowley believed at the time that the letters of the rethyr's name, TEX, corresponded to Caput Draconis (the Dragon's Head), Gem­ini, and Earth. In his mind, §5 likely was understood primarily as the Dragon's Head itself, understood to be distinctly phallic, and corresponding to all of the \"father\" references. But (in a testimony to magick) the real symbols asserted them­selves despite his misdirection. The letters of TEX actually corre­spond to Caput, Virgo, and Earth.

At one level, this embodies God according to the conventional religious ideas preva­lent in this vision (and which filled Crowley's devotion in 1900). In a deeper sense, ' symbolizes that highest divinity, or central spark, of our individual being, called Yechidah (and represented by the flame within the lamp in all representations of The Hermit). In fact, the relationship of ', the Inmost Light, to n, the outermost called The Universe, is that of the \"One Light\" to the \"thousand;\" compare the Tao Teh Ching's references to \"the one thing\" vs. \"the 10,000 things.\" \"Houses of Eternity\" may simply be a poetic expression of self-evident meaning; but it also was a common title in ancient Egypt for tombs, particularly pyramids. The phrase reflects that these great burial places were not seen as domiciles of the dead, but as habitations in eternity. This paints an image, in the present text, of pyramids being called to \"lift up their heads\" to hear the word uttered from the north. Later, we will learn that the attained realm of Binah is called \"City of Pyramids,\" and that its 'pyra­mids' are the liberated Masters themselves. This verse appears to address that aspect of our being even this early in the story. There are multiple fine points in the text corresponding to the letters AMBZ (�:::li'.J�) if they are treated as Hebrew:� is the 1 that is 1 ,000, � is \"sword,\" :::l is \"house,\" and 1'.J is The Hanged Man that perhaps must be told, \"Lift up your head.\" But these fine points, rattling around in Crowley's well-filled Virgo-Aquarian brain, should not overwhelm the essential message, which is that reality, as previously known, was about to be shaken by the opening of new v1s10n. 6.

Remember that this is a voice of subconsciousness speaking; and the language depicts a drawing more deeply into the subconscious aspect of mind, withdrawing from conventional waking con­sciousness anchored in time and space. Within these dark depths, there is to be a new seeding. The \"spouse\" is the reon itself, the old"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"90 Visions & Voices framework of things (that had prevailed for thousands of years) now being \"fallen and defiled,\" and a new young mother sought for the begetting of a new universe. (Observe how the letters on the book, AMBZ, expressed in Tarot as Hierophant, Star, Emperor, and Lust, disclose the same basic message.) Mostly, this paragraph spells out the name of the rethyr using symbols for the letters. Time and darkness = n, the Enochian X, Saturn, Earth, The Universe in Tarot. As previously, \"my Father\" = ', the Enochian E, The Hermit. The \"spouse to replace her who is fallen and defiled\" is the purity of The High Priestess, l, the Enochian T. 1 This is one of those passages that could be taken as apocalyptic or revolutionary, either for Crowley's own psyche or for the world. But note, also, that these same symbols are appropriate for any deep initiation into the sephirah Malkuth. Such experiences are marked by one's struggle with existing limits of perception (sensory and time-space bound) and the intuition that there is something beyond them. Malkuth is also the Qabalistic \"bride\" or \"spouse,\" embodied by Shekinah. At the other extreme, these words are a primitive foreshadowing of Babalon, who is yet to be introduced to our cast of characters. 7. Seal the boot? with the seals of the Stars Concealed: for the Rivers have rushed together and the Name i11i1' is brol:?en in a thousand pieces (against the Cubic Stone). The \"Stars Concealed\" are the \"seven Interior Stars\" or chakras. Thus, the Book is to be sealed with seven seals, with obvious analogy to The Apocalypse of St. John with which Crowley was intimately familiar. The four rivers are those mentioned in Gene­sis, Chapter 2, and in the Practicus (3=8) ritual of the Golden Dawn. They correspond to the four elements. The Qabalistic doc­trine states that the One Stream flowed forth from the Supernals as the river Nahar (1i1J), and, in Da'ath, was divided into four. In this present vision, these four \"have rushed together,\" returning to their Undivided Source, the four articulated letters of i=ni1' crashing to­gether into their original unity (1,000 = � = 1). 1 Or, since Crowley, at the time, understood the E in TEX to be Gemini, \"spouse\" probably meant to him the wedding portrayed in Atu VI, The Lovers, Gemini; and \"my Father\" was, to him then, the phallic serpent implied by the Dragon's Head. s. 1he 01:1 'J:a lilllthalh ...... ...."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"-.. thousands of years) 'JOUllg mother sought line how the letters on lllpbant, Star, Emperor, I lillie of the rethyr using � = n, the Enochian X, -=viously, \"my Father\" lillie to replace her who �High Priestess, l, the � 11-e taken as apocalyptic pnt psyche or for the \"* are appropriate for � Such experiences ra limits of perception d.tuition that there is • Qabalistic \"bride\" or ' � extreme, these , n, who is yet to be ·Fl Concealed: for the ·. i11il � is brol:len in a � Stars\" or chakras. � seals, with obvious which Crowley was mentioned in Gene­ritual of the Golden The Qabalistic doc­from the Supernals as -into four.

The New Jerusalem was itself depicted as cubical.1 Ultimately, this is not substantially different from the foregoing interpretation, for the Garden of Eden from Genesis and the New Jerusalem from The Apocalypse are two expressions of cognate ideas. 8. Tremble ye, 0 Pillars of the Universe, for Eternity is in travail of a Terrible Child; she shall bring forth an universe of Darl:lness, whence shall leap forth a spar�? that shall put his father to flight. \"Eternity,\" the whole of Time, is an epithet of Saturn, n. It is spe­cifically portrayed as female, an easy reference to Binah, the se­phirah of Saturn, called the Great Mother. Whether at the individ­ual or collective level, this shows her pregnancy at its term, with something entirely new, a \"Terrible Child,\" about to be born, shaking the supports of reality. It is, of course, tempting to interpret this entirely in terms of the prophecy delivered through Crowley three years later promulgat­ing a New lEon for humanity in the person of the god Horus as a Crowned and Conquering Child. It would be a mistake, though, to overlook the portents in this passage for Crowley's own psyche in late 1900, and the heralding of the new century hovering immedi­ately before him. 9. The Obelisl:ls are brol:len; the stars have rushed together: the Light hath plunged into the Abyss: the Heavens are mixed with Hell. This paragraph resembles certain Masonic rituals through which Crowley had passed only weeks prior. In particular, it is a para­phrase of one passage of the 18°, or Rose-Croix degree, of the Scottish Rite. It shows the ruin of the old world in the dark hours before a new dawn. 10. My Father shall not hear their Noise: His ears are closed: His eyes are covered with the clouds of Night. God (') is shown as blind and deaf to this symbolic calamity, a dramatic device for enhancing feelings of hopeless catastrophe. 1 The entire pattern of this Holy City, including the four rivers, will be familiar to Architects of Temple ofThelema."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"92 Visions & Voices 11. The End! the End! the End! For the Eye of Shiva He hath opened: the Universe is nabed before Him: for the JEon of Saturn leaneth toward the Bosom of Death. Nearly every important word of this paragraph bespeaks Saturn, Tav, n, The Universe, terminus, the bosom of death, &c. Following this paragraph is a graphic. Crowley interpreted it as \"Drawing all to a point: whence blooms erect a Triple Triad.\" It feels like something new breaking ground . ••• §§12-14: From midnight we pass to sunrise. The second messenger is manifest in the east. 12. The Angel of the East hath a boob of red written in letters of Blue ;v 7S;. The Boob grows before my eyes and filleth the Whole Heaven. The characters written on the cover of the red book are the Enochian letters ABFMA. As with the first book's title, if these let­ters are enumerated as if they were Hebrew (�7J1��), they total to 50! They bear the same core message ofNun, J, and Scorpio as be­fore. The zodiacal correspondences are Taurus, Aries, Cauda Draconis, Aquarius, Taurus. The Tarot cards corresponding to these are The Hierophant, The Emperor, The Priestess, The Star, and (again) The Hierophant. This message appears to be addressed to the second stratum of our psyches, the Ruach or ego-consciousness - the rational, con­trolling, self-differentiating aspect of mind currently characteristic of healthy adult humanity. 13.

The word translated \"tempt\" actually means \"to test.\" In any case, in context, we see that it is the usual counsel regarding Ruach or ego-consciousness: that it must consciously choose to acknowledge, and open itself to, something higher than itself, and also that it is held accountable for a certain amount of common sense. 14. I see above the BooR a multitude of white-robed Ones from whom droppeth a great rain of Blood: but above them is a Golden Sun, having an eye, whence a great Light. Compare similar images in Revelations. It is also a suitable image of dawn - whether the dawn of the forthcoming New LEon, or, more intimately, the pending awakening of Crowley's deeper spir­itual consciousness. The \"multitude\" are white-robed both be­cause they have shed their blood (symbol of their mortal lives) and to reflect their essential natures. We shall encounter more and deeper mysteries of blood, the life-stream of Adepts, as the visions progress. ••• §§15-26: The third messenger is manifest in the south, as if it were the Sun at its greatest height and majesty. This message appears to complete the previous two by speaking directly to Neshamah, or superconscious­ness. 15. I turned me to the South: and read therein: 16. Seal up the BooR! SpeaR not that which thou seest and reveal it unto none: for the ear is not framed that shall hear it: nor the tongue that can speaR it! In any case, the message is veiled from any mortal aspect of con­sciousness. In particular, the message given here is not expressible in human speech. It is beyond the sensibilities of both Nephesh and Ruach, but within the sensibilities of Neshamah. Its nonverbal language is commonly called \"the speaking silence.\""},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"94 Visions & Voices 17. 0 Lord God, blessed, blessed, blessed be Thou for ever! \"Lord God\" is the usual translation of 'J1� rl1i1' = 91, the value of li'J�, amen, a title of Kether.

In the technique of astral scrying that Crowley learned in the Golden Dawn, he would have begun an astral investigation such as this by deliberately aligning his consciousness with the symbols he set out to psychically examine: in this case, the symbol series Dragon's Head, Gemini, Earth, the central one of which would have included all of the symbolism of the letter Zayin (l, \"sword\") and Atu VI, The Lovers. The words speak of an intimate spiritual union, continuing the core theme of the message from the south (§§15-26). 25. 0 that Our Bed were seen of Men, that they might rejoice in My Fertility: that My Sister might partabe of My Great Light. \"Sister\" probably refers to Earth broadly, and humanity as a mi­crocosm in particular. A similar construction was used in Liber Legis I :53, in 1904, when the goddess Nuit speaks of \"the little world my sister.\" \"Little world\" is the literal meaning of micro­cosm. The bed (and the union occurring thereon) eventually will be seen in the 4th .tEthyr near the end of the series . 26. 0 Light of God, when wilt thou find the heart of man - write not!

Being in the west, where night begins, the fourth archangel signals that the path before us is into the night, the unknown, and (as im­plied by Nun, J, earlier) through the gates of death.

(The fact that 1� is a Hebrew word meaning \"pain\" and \"failure\" does not seem to contradict this: see §32.) There may be another significance of this 51. If this fourth messenger is addressing subconsciousness, ego-consciousness, and superconsciousness united, then it is a symbol of what alche­mists call the Stone. The Latin word LAPIS, meaning \"stone,\" enumerates to 51. The Enochian letters, AN equates to Taurus and Scorpio, signs corresponding, respectively, to the Hebrew letters Vav, 1, and Nun, J.

For thou wilt find a life which is as Death: or a Death which should be infinite. 30. For Thou art submitted to the Four: Five thou shalt find, but Seven is lone and far. Crowley, in November 1900, was an Adeptus Minor 5=6 of the Second Order of the Golden Dawn (i.e., the R.R. et A.C.). As such, he had been \"submitted\" to the four elements in five prior grades. Although he was nominally 5=6, he had not yet attained to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel (represented here as the Pentagram, or \"Five\") by which A:.A:. recognizes that Grade. Nonetheless, it was within his reach as a di­rect consequence of his Adeptus Minor initiation and the obliga­tion he took on that occasion. But \"Seven\" - the Heptagram of Babalon, the attainment of the grade of Mastery of the Temple (or 8°=3°)-was still \"lone and far.\" The 8°=3° grade is attributed to sephirah 3, Binah. From at least the 13th Century, Kabbalists have linked the attainment of Binah to this number 7. For example, in Sha'are Orah, in the chapter titled, \"The Eight Gate: The Third Sphere\" (8°=3°), we read: Behold, this Sphere that is known as Binah, is the essence of the revelation of the hidden Name of the world's Creation [Elohim ]. For all the sevens were established from Her and their emanation stems from Her, and it is for Her that they yearn ... Know that wherever you find in the Torah the number seven, ... it is the es-sence of the Spheres from Y esod to Binah ... Throughout these visions is an emerging presence of the god­dess Babalon, the essence of Binah, to whom the number 7 is sa­cred. This is reflected superficially in the seven letters of her name, but more deeply in the ideas expressed above. Seven had a further importance in the ancient mysteries, as in early mathematics: The value TT, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its radius, was commonly estimated as 22 + 7. Therefore, 7 represents the radius, the straight line to the center from any point on the circumference: mystically speaking, the straight path from the outermost to the inmost. It is this \"Seven\" that Crowley was told, in 1900, was still \"lone and far\" for him."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"98 Visions & Voices 31. 0 Lord God, let Thy Spirit hither unto me! As before, \"Lord God\" translates to 91, a symbol of Kether - that inmost center to which 7, the radius, leads. 32. For I am lost in the night of infinite pain: no hope: no God: no resurrection: no end: I fall: I fear. This is the bleak emptiness of the outer face ofBinah, and of many lesser thresholds in the mystical journey. One's present perceptual anchors (both to the inner and to the outer) have to be released, as if in molting, before the next step becomes evident: we must die to our past to be born to our future. (As mentioned above, V�, the ti­tle of the fourth angel's book, means \"pain.\") 33. 0 Saviour of the World, bruise Thou my Head with Thy foot to save the world, that once again I touch Him whom I slew, that in my death I feel the radiance and the heat of the moving of Thy Robes!

OVERVIEW: As indicated with respect to the previous vision, there is insufficient information on which to base an astrological commentary of the visions of the 30th and 29th LEthyrs. (The lim­ited notes from the prior vision apply to this one also.) I shall pro­ceed, therefore, with a Qabalistic analysis. RII or C. L L corresponds to Pisces, Sagittarius, Sagittarius. It enumerates to 100 + 60 + 60 = 220. This is the number of verses in The Book of the Law, which this vision foreshadows by three and a half years. · To Crowley, at the time he obtained this vision in 1900, 220 was especially meaningful as the value of the letters R.C. (::::>:1), in which are represented the formal mysteries of adepthood: 220 is one of the keys to understanding the Adeptus Minor ritual of the R.R. et A.C. through which he had recently passed. The ten se­phiroth of the descending Flaming Sword united, by multiplica­tion, with the 22 paths of the ascending Serpent of Wisdom to form the Tree of Life. For further insight, see also the section on 220 in Appendix A. The 291h LEthyr corresponds to Yesod of Yetzirah. Yesod means \"foundation,\" and corresponds especially to subconscious­ness and the patterns therein on which the architecture of our indi­vidual psyches rests. Herein, also, are the beginnings of the Foun­dation of a New LEon."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"100 Visions & Voices 1. The st?y appears covered with stars of gold; the bacbground is of green. But the impression is also of darbness. Green is the color of Venus. (Olive speckled gold is one of the colors of N etzach, Venus' sephirah.) This initial setting suggests, by color, that it reflects a part of consciousness expressive of the creative feminine, illuminated by points of solar gold light. 2. An immense eagle-angel is before me. His wings seem to hide all the Heaven. In the east appears an eagle, symbolic of Scorpio, alchemical Wa­ter, the feminine, i1 in i=l1i1', Understanding.1 Years later, Crowley would come to understand correctly that the Kerubic eagle is the symbol of elemental Air, not Water; but, at this point, he was filled with the teachings of the Golden Dawn that attribute it to Water and Scorpio. The vision, therefore, is configured like a ceremony wherein guardians at the four quarters represent the four elements so dis­tributed that Scorpio-Taurus mark east-west, and Leo-Aquarius mark south-north, much as if the stars Antares, Regulus, and Al­debaran (respectively, the brightest stars in Scorpio, Leo, and Tau­rus) were rising, culminating, and setting. Antares-Aldebaran were the defining axis of the ancient zodiac (they each being at 15° of their respective signs), and Scorpio-Taurus corresponds to the He­brew letters Nun, J, and Vav, 1, which spell 1J, Nu, the name of the goddess of space itself. Adding Teth, tl, for Leo in the south, and we have one spelling of the longer form, tl1J, Nuit. I have given this long explanation to show that the essential ar­chitecture of this vision bespeaks ancient goddess mysteries an­chored by ideas that will drive this entire series of visions. Scorpio sets the theme with ideas of serpentine energies, sexuality, death and regeneration, and the transcendental expression of all of these in kundalini, transformation, and apotheosis: energies that Crow­ley, in his own notes to this vision, called \"dark, bewildering, and terrifying.\" 3. He cried aloud saying: The Voice of the Lord upon the Waters: the Terror of God upon Manbind.

Open thine eyes of Flame and Light, 0 Cod, upon the wicRed! Lighten thine Eyes! The Clamour of Thy Voice, let it smite down the Mountains! The words of the eagle-angel shake existing ideas and curse exist­ing reality. Note the entreaty to God, \"Let Thy Mercy be lost in the great Deep!\" In other words, let Chesed (\"mercy\") be absorbed in the Abyss. 4. Let us not see it! Cover we our eyes, lest we see the End of Man. s. Close we our ears, lest we hear the cry of Woman. 6. Let none speaR of it: let none write it: I, I am troubled, my eyes are moist with dews of terror: surely the Bitterness of Death is past. Continuing, the angel pleas for shutting down faculties of sight (Fire) and hearing (Spirit)- our highest human faculties- that we be insensible to the destruction, and that it also be inexpressible by us. It is portrayed as unmanageable, intolerable horror. ••• 7. And I turned me to the South and lo! a great lion as wounded and perplexed. We tum to the south. There we see an angelic guardian in the form of a lion, corresponding to Leo, alchemical Fire, the masculine, ' in ii1i1', Wisdom. For unclear reasons, Crowley (then or later) interpreted this figure as symbolic of the Beast 666 (with which he personally identified), the thrust of the New lEon dawning. Yet this lion is \"wounded and perplexed.\" He is not the vital, creative, forth­pouring masculine but, at the very least, is lost and wounded like Amfortas. He is also the past. Not pausing to get lost in whatever psychic patterning drew Crowley's identification with this maimed beast, I submit that it portrays the wounded male, the im­pairment of the distorted expression of masculinity that had exist­ed and reigned in the Old lEon named after Osiris - a distinctive developmental stage of humanity that, in 1900, was ancient, wounded, and soon to die."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"102 Visions & Voices 8. He cried: I have conquered! Let the Sons of Earth beep silence; for my Name is become as That of Death! He speaks in the past tense. The words speak for themselves. 9. When will men learn the Mysteries of Creation? 10. How much more those of the Dissolution (and the Pang of Fire)? The mysteries of creation rest on the knowledge that creation al­ways comes from destruction. Neither the medium, the artist, nor the context can survive as they were before; all are changed. Forty months later, in Liber Legis, Nuit would express this by saying: 29For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union. 30This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all. In 1900, Western medical science was not yet even united in the idea that human procreation arose from cell contributions by both the female and the male. Some textbooks still represented that the male placed the next generation within the female, whose job was to gestate and deliver it. One does not then find reference to the woman's seed. That was about to change . ••• 11. I turned me to the West and there was a great Bull; White with horns of White and Blacb and Gold. His mouth was scarlet and his eyes as Sapphire stones. With a great sword he shore the sbies asunder, and amid the silver flashes of the steel grew light­nings and deep clouds of Indigo. The guardian of the west is a bull, corresponding to Taurus, al­chemical Earth, rl in rl1i1'; but here the symbols become confused, because Taurus itself is attributed to 1 corresponding (in rl1i1') to Air, the son of Fire and Water. Therefore, the sword is his weapon, and we see other emblems of Air (the skies, lightning) and Yesod (silver, indigo). And Luna is exalted in Taurus. He is in the west because his time is ending. This refers to the fall of Christianity as the prevailing paradigm. Crowley observed the hull's correspondence to cognate deities, such as Osiris and Mithras, and observed that he \"complains of the terrible things that are happening, especially the Freedom (which he thinks shame-His mother is Hcb-final ;1.

The worR of the Moon is done! Motion is ended for ever! The fulfillment of Y esod in Y etzirah, to which this rethyr corre­sponds. Y esod is Change; the Moon is a symbol of this change, even as Y etzirah is a constantly shifting plane of labile, transient images and energies. To complete the curriculum of the Moon is to gain the \"magick power\" of rising above this volatility. Yet, even as one thereafter is drawn closer in relationship to the Eter­nal, the Timeless, and the Sure, Change persists with its own in­variability, on its own plane; for Movement is the nature of all life.

I heard a Great Voice from above crying: Thou liest! For the Volatile hath indeed fixed itself; but it hath arisen above thy sight. The World is desert: but the Abodes of the House of my Fa­ther are peopled; and His Throne is crusted over with white Bril­liant Stars, a lustre of bright gems. This is a complicated doctrine, but one worth understanding. It de­scribes a process that occurs within each of us individually as we progress through successive layers of initiation; and, here, it is de­scribed as having occurred in humanity as a whole. Alchemically, the \"volatilizing of the fixed\" is followed by \"the fixing of the volatile.\" That is, the first step is destabilization. Destruction (even if it is but the splitting of a cell) is the seed of creation. New conditions are born out of disorder, providing them greater freedom to become what they will. As a thing increasingly approximates what it is rightly to be (one might say, what it al-"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"104 Visions & Voices ready is potentially), it stabilizes into that form or pattern: the vol­atile becomes fixed. In consciousness, that which emancipates itself from prior stuck states will rise above the old stratum. This is expressed in legend by \"the gods departing earth,\" or in magical tradition by \"the adepts ascending to the next plane.\" Success breeds emptiness much as satiation flattens desire -until desire, being a living thing, is renewed. Thus, in the moment of fulfillment, \"the World is de­sert,\" but the heavens beyond it are populated . ••• 17. In the North is a Man upon a Cireat Horse, having a Scourge and Balances in his hand (or a long spear glitters at his bad� or in his hand). He is clothed in blad� velvet and his face is stern and terrible. There have been an eagle, lion, and bull thus far; so, the import of the present figure is especially that it is the fourth Kerubic image, the human. Having encountered Scorpio, Leo, and Taurus, we would expect this human figure to express Aquarius. Instead, it is an expression of Libra (another \"Air sign\" in Aquarius' place) in the form of severe justice. The figure is dark, and in the north -the place of midnight, \"the Beneath\" -marking both an end and a be­ginning. Saturn (black, stem, terrible) is exalted in Libra (and also the classic ruler of Aquarius). The figure's form seems intentional­ly to resemble the tone and style of one of the four horsemen of The Apocalypse. 18. He spal:?e saying: I have judged! It is the end: the gate of the beginning. Loot? in the Beneath and thou shalt see a new world! The \"end\" is also \"the gate of the beginning.\" Saturn (as Libra, Aquarius, or both) invites our attention to the future. Where, in the Vision of the 301h JEthyr (Malkuth), we were admonished, \"Look not Beneath!\" we are here (in Yesod) instructed, \"Look in the Be­neath and ... see a new world!\" Subconsciousness reflects superconsciousness. This rethyr cor­responds to Yesod in Yetzirah, the field of subconsciousness. Pat­terns have changed. Through the symbols of initiation, a psycho­logical readiness exists. The invitation is to gaze \"down,\" into subconsciousness (often called the \"Pool of the Moon\"), and see the reflected revelation of higher consciousness. _.

I Joobed and saw a great abyss and a darb funnel of whirling waters or fixed airs, wherein were cities and monsters and trees and atoms and mountains and little flames (being souls) and all the material of an universe. 20. And all are sucbed down one by one, as necessity hath or­dained. For below is a glittering jewelled globe of gold and az­ure, set in a World of Stars. Air, originally shown as Libra, now acts as herald for Aquarius. The blue and gold vision set in \"a World of Stars\" is a symbol of the goddess Nuit. 21. And there came a Voice from the Abyss, saying: \"Thou seest the Current of Destiny! Canst thou change one atom in its path? I am Destiny. Dost thou thinb to control me? for who can move my course?\" This voice (originating in the heights, but echoed from the depths) is probably best understood as an expression of Crowley's Holy Guardian Angel. It describes itself as the inevitability of a great wave or current already in motion. 22. And there falleth a thunderbolt therein: a catastrophe of ex­plosion: and all is shattered. And I saw above me a Vast Arm reach down, darb and terrible, and a voice cried: I AM ETERNI­TY. 23. And a great mingled cry arose: \"No! no! no! All is changed; all is confounded; naught is ordered: the white is stained with blood: the blacb is bissed of the Christ! Return! Return! It is a new chaos that thou findest here: chaos for thee: for us it is the sbele­ton of a New Truth!\" The old world, representative of the Old lEon, is shattered. There is a new chaos; but (as Liber Legis later would say), \"there is that which remains.\" At a personal level, this can be recognized as a ripening of the effects of Crowley's Adeptus Minor initiation six or nine months earlier. At an impersonal level, it shows the under­lying Y etziratic (\"astral\") preparation for the inauguration of the lEon of Horus in March 1904. Yet the \"New Truth\" (about to be disclosed in §§24-25) is not yet ready to be revealed except \"in skeleton.\""},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"106 Visions & Voices 24.

The charac­ter Crowley saw was the Daleth, 1, in this alphabet: It is not completely clear whether this letter being a Daleth (Venus) was significant to Crowley, but the effect seems to have been soothing and encouraging to him. The vision which began with the sky in the emerald color of Venus had been sealed with this token of her sacred letter, Daleth.

Only the signs and degrees of the planet positions are different; but all of the relationships are exactly the same. • House placements are the same, since the same house sys­tem (Campanus) was used for both charts. • Aspects between the planets are exactly the same. • Planetary proximities to the horoscopic angles (horizon and meridian) are the same.

They all squared Saturn, which was high in the sky at the Zenith 1 and conjunct the Moon. Mars was on the Midheaven, and Jupiter on the Lower Heaven (IC). This is quite a lot of activity on the angles! Such a horde of in­fluences can be a disadvantage, because the interweaving of so many prominent factors makes it harder to distinguish the exact ef­fects of any one of them. We are best served by giving the most weight to the closest contacts (smallest orb) which, in this case, means focusing on the Neptune-Uranus-Venus-Saturn set, and not­ing that Mars and Jupiter are of only secondary importance. And, indeed, the hideous Lovecraftian creature dominating most of the vision is a splendid blend of Uranus-Neptune bizarre and Venus-Saturn disgusting. Notice though, that as the vision progresses over the following hour, this all changes. The initially angular planets move away from the angles. The vision reached its dramatic climax about the time the Moon crossed the Midheaven (8:38 p.m.). By the end of the vision, the Midheaven had just passed Saturn; and, indeed, the vision's end is quite Saturnian, being swallowed up in darkness. The Moon is gibbous, approaching Full Moon. Experience suggests that there would be much inner vitality and strength, re­flected (among other things) in the intensity of the vision. This vi­tality would be expected to build over the next several days, as the Moon moved closer to Full. Only one transit to Crowley's natal horoscope existed within 1°. It was Neptune's ego-dissolving square to his Sun. This would be joined by Uranus by November 29 when the 21st .tEthyr was at­tempted. The Uranus-Neptune opposition was the most important general astrological pattern in the sky for November-December 1909. (This opposition is one of the primary \"characters\" of our story. We shall gradually learn more about it as we progress.) Its square to Aleister Crowley's Sun - in the specific sequence of first Neptune, then Uranus - is the chief indicator of his extraor­dinary adventure in consciousness, this remapping of inner dimen­sions of his being. It startles us not at all to find this exact aspect precisely on the horizon for the very minute he sat down to begin. 1 \"Zenith\" is often mistaken for the Midheaven in a horoscope. Literally, the Zenith is the highest point in the sky (directly overhead). Its longitude in a hor­oscope is the same as the upper square to the Ascendant-in this case, 25°44' Pisces (Sidereal) or 19°13' Aries (Tropical)."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"112 Visions & Voices This timing of Crowley's undertaking is also marked by two important aspects in his Secondary Progressions. In the hour he again took up the scrying of the Enochian rethyrs after nine years, and began this scrying of the 28th iEthyr, his progressed Sun was at 0°20' Scorpio in the Sidereal Zodiac (23°21' Scorpio Tropical), or only 0°06' past exact opposition to his natal Pluto. This is a life­redefining aspect because it is fundamentally self-redefining. Such Sun-Pluto aspects indicate that awareness is turned inward. One perceives selfhood more directly and more reverently - but with all of one's old definitions upended, all of one's old anchors ripped loose. In the time it would take the Moon to circle the Earth, this is exactly what was about to occur to Aleister Crowley. And to soften the transition (by softening his ego barriers, in­viting more inwardly turned reflection, and increasing psychic and emotional sensitivity), Crowley's progressed Moon at 8°38' Gem­ini (Sidereal) was sextile his natal and progressed Neptunes: 21' shy of the former and 35' past the latter. Returning to the vision, note the \"fish\" traits of the angel; and those physical details not \"fishy\" are strongly Scorpionic. The presence of the Moon in Pisces and the Sun in Scorpio in the Side­real Zodiac should not be missed in this regard. There are other Piscean characteristics to the vision as well, es­pecially features also consistent with the Moon-Saturn conjunc­tion.

The 28th iEthyr is also attributed to Hod in Yetzirah. This is a remarkable attribution; for many of the symbols employed, espe­cially in the description of the angel guarding the rethyr, are sym­bols of Mercury, including the opalescence of the garments, the quality of the eyes, the appearance of a fish, the sharp black-white contrast, and other symbols. 1 6 = 1 + 2 + 3.

The face is very terrible in­deed to loob upon. Now in front of him is a wheel, with many spobes, and many tyres; it is libe a fence in front of him. As already mentioned, the initial appearance of the angel corre­sponds to Hod ideas, including the basic appearance of a fire opal. The fieriness and general severity also correspond to Aries and the Bin BAG. The wheel before him initially acts like a barrier. As the vision progresses, it appears that this wheel symbolizes time. 2. And he cries: 0 man, who art thou that wouldst penetrate the Mystery? for it is hidden unto the End of Time. 3. And I answer him: Time is not, save in the darbness of Her womb by whom evil came. He must overcome the illusion of time before he can proceed. Not only is this a Saturn idea, but his response is filled with words re­flecting both the Saturn and maternal aspects ofBinah . It is common in initiation ceremonies to confront the candidate with some form of the question, \"Who are you?\" That this vision began with the same question gives it something of the tone of such ceremonies. 4. And now the wheel breabs away, and I see him as he is. His garment is blacb beneath the opal veils, but it is lined with white, and he has the shining belly of a fish, and enormous wings of blacb and white feathers, and innumerable little legs and claws libe a centipede, and a long tail libe a scorpion.

These themes appear throughout the series of visions, regardless of a particular rethyr's distinctive characteristics. They are all part of one big initiation to Binah for Aleister Crowley. 5. And I answer him: Sorrow is not, save in the darl:?ness of the womb of Her by whom came evil. 6. I pierce the Mystery of his breast, and therein is a jewel. It is a sapphire as great as an ostrich egg, and thereon is graven this sigil: At the heart of the Mystery of this angel and this rethyr is a sap­phire, a deep blue stone attributed to Jupiter. What is its signifi­cance here? Such a stone would have deep mystical properties. Specifically, as Jupiter's stone, it corresponds to the sephirah Chesed and the 7°=4° Grade (Exempt Adept) which Crowley then held and, to him, therefore likely represented simply a gate to deeper spiritual truths. We learn in § 11 that this spherical jewel contains the watch­towers of the Universe, the ramparts of the cubical material uni­verse which is at the center of the 30 concentric spherical rethyrs. This jewel is, then, somehow, representative of one of the rethyrs (or, perhaps, of all of them). 7. But there is also much writing on the stone, very minute char­acters carved. I cannot read them. He points with his flail to the sapphire, which is now outside him and bigger than himself; and he cries: Hail! warden of the Gates of Eternity who l:?nowest not thy right hand from thy left; for in the CEon of my Father is a god with clasped hands wherein he holdeth the universe, crushing it into the dust that ye call stars.

Hail unto thee who l:?nowest not thy right eye from thy left; for in the ceon of my Father there is but one light. 9.

Hail unto thee who l:?nowest not thy right ear from thy left; for in the ceon of my Father there is neither sound nor silence. The right and left eyes, in the Qabalistic correspondences taught within the Golden Dawn, respectively, correspond to the Sun and Moon, in whom \"there is but one light.\" The right and left nostrils correspond, respectively, to Mars and Venus. The standard glyphs of these two planets, d and 9, are nearly identical to the Egyptian hieroglyphics for death (khopet) and life (ankh). The right and left ears correspond, respectively, to Saturn and Jupiter. 11.

Let not her be put to shame that lieth among the lilies that are beyond the stars. \"Let not the shame of my Mother be unveiled,\" &c. Certainly this is relevant to the whole course of these mystical visions of aspira­tion unto Binah; but it is also, in this quiet moment within the vi­sion, likely also reflective of the contents of Crowley's personal subconscious. Luna was conjunct Saturn, near the Midheaven at the very moment this occurred, bespeaking the anguish of both Crowley's and humanity's alienation from the maternal archetype. Lilies are attributed to Malkuth. She \"that lieth among the lilies that are beyond the stars\" is a symbol of the Daughter, Heh-final, rr, Malkuth - Psyche, the Soul - that has been lifted up unto the throne of the Mother, Heh, i1, Binah, the Celestial Queen."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"116 Visions & Voices 13. 0 man, that must ever be opening, when wilt thou learn to seal up the mysteries of the creation? to fold thyself over thyself as a rose in the embrace of night?

It is common that we have to slay something within ourselves, time after time, as we essay the path of awakening. Here, in a brief knight-and-dragon struggle (a prominent archetype in the British race-mind), Crowley had to slay some devilish mental construct of his own. The words he wins are all Saturn terms. 18. Thou shalt be vexed by dispersion. \"Dispersion\" is the meaning of the name Choronzon, the great demon he would meet and battle in the 1Oth lEthyr. 19. But now, if the sun arise, fold thou thine arms; then shall God smite thee into a pillar of salt. \"now\"- that is, he is still an Adept, not yet a Master. We could at­tempt to interpret this through its obvious reference to Genesis 19:26, where \"pillar of salt\" is n�7J :r:�n, n 'tziv melakh = 230; but §20 immediately warns us not to get stuck in that sort of mystical number crunching. Rather, the meaning of this striking image is to be found in simpler terms.

Salt, on the other hand, is a symbol of Bi­nah and the 8°=3°, or Master, grade. It is his Adepthood, his em­bodiment of the symbol of the Rosy Cross, that would prepare him for his Mastery. That is, in the fulfilled Knowledge and Conversa­tion of the Holy Guardian Angel, it is the Angel that prepares the Adept and conducts him or her to the Ordeal of the Abyss. 20.

Thou hast the signs; thou hast the words; but there are many things that are not in my power, who am but the warden of the 28th JEthyr. One of the most valuable instructions in the book: Truth comes from intuition, not intellect. This is a core revelation of this 28th JEthyr, which corresponds to Hod in Y etzirah, even as it is learned in the Practicus Grade of A:.A:. (which also corresponds to Hod in Y etzirah). The passage also hints at important mysteries of the 7°=4° Grade of Adeptus Exemptus corresponding to Chesed. The angel says that he cannot give him the Word of the Abyss that the seer demanded. (It is not his to give.) And yet he told him where to look for it when he said, \"Thou hast the signs; thou hast the words,\" referring to the signs and passwords of all the grades through 7°=4°, all of which Crowley had received. Those seven passwords, each based on a mathematical formula of the sephirah corresponding to the grade, total to 55+ 45 + 36 + 28 + 21 + 15 + 10 = 21 0; and 210 is, in fact, the value of the Word of the Abyss he would learn later: N.O.X. 21.

The names of the three angels of the 281h JEthyr, as known to Crowley, are LABNIXP, FOCISNI, and OX­LOPAR. Crowley obtained, using these, the name LIXIPSP, which he enumerated as 533; but the seventeenth letter of these names is L, not P (he counted from the wrong direction in the last name), giving LIXIPSL. There is a further error of his mistaking P as the letter of Leo; its correct attribution is Cancer. Therefore, us­ing the geomancy-based method of enumerating Enochian: LIXIPSL = CE/\"\\1 /CEIICE = n,o,n,o,n, l,n=491 which should be the formula of the name of this angel-warden. My gematria notebook has 27 Hebrew entries for 491, several of which could fit the present cethyr and its guardian well enough, yet none of which is decisively descriptive. Among the more in­teresting is 1n�rJi11;, lahamiytho, \"to slay him;\" vide § 17 of the vi­sion. But perhaps the most descriptive attribution for him is the Greek a<JKo<;, \"wineskin.\" If LIXIPSL is enumerated using the values for Enochian letters I recommended in Chapter 3, the total is 620. This is the value of 1n::>, Kether, the Crown, which is the apex of the Tree of Life. Frankly, this seems a poor showing for this particular angel. But the name seems to have no practical use. It does not, for example, lead to words that give the message of the verse follow­ing, nor does it offer itself for other use. Its only value seems to be in its power to distract or preoccupy Crowley's mind, playing to the same weakness he had been warned about immediately before, in §20. Crowley, so to speak, was being given the bum's rush out the side door of the cethyr. 24. Now cometh from every side at once a voice, terribly great, crying: Close the veil; the great blasphemy hath been uttered; the face of my Mother is scarred by the nails of the devil. Shut the boot?, destroy the breal:?er of the seal! A summary, repeating essential teachings from earlier in the vi­sion. Especially, the text shows resistance that the mysteries of the Great Mother be disclosed, and vividly portrays the scarring dam­age that humanity had inflicted upon it in the millennia just prior."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"120 Visions & Voices 25.

And this darbness swallows everything up, and the angel is gone from the stone; and there is no light therein, save only the light of the Rose and of the Cross. \"And the darkness swallows everything up.\" Saturn had just crossed the Midheaven as the vision came to its close. \" ... only the light of the Rose and of the Cross.\" Phrases like this appear many times in these visions. One might, at first expo­sure, suppose they referred to a stirring and stilling beatitude; but in fact, it is a physical detail of the method of scrying. Crowley obtained these visions using, as a scrying stone, a large topaz with a rose-and-cross design engraved into its face. This concluding phrase simply means, therefore, that he was withdrawn from the vision and found himself staring, once again, at his stone. AUMALE, ALGERIA.

In fact, the only really distinctive differences are that the Moon has by now moved another 15° along in the zodiac (and, in the Sidereal Zodiac changed signs from Pisces to Aries), and there are aspect differences. The Venus-Neptune opposition is now vir­tually exact (0°06'), and the Sun-Mars trine only a little wider. The Moon now sextiles Pluto exactly, whereas on the prior day it was in platic conjunction with Saturn. As in the Vision of the 28th JEthyr, the number of angular plan­ets makes it harder to discern the specific control a particular plan­et may have exercised in the vision.1 Uranus-Neptune remains su­premely strong, now joined by Venus (drawing Mysteries of Woman to the vision's forefront). The Moon continues to increase in her light: Full Moon ap­proaches. During these early visions, the raw force or pressure of the inner, spiritual light is increasing. As the visions progress, a 1 An interesting pattern is hidden in these planets, though: As shown later, the chief symbols of this vision correspond to Pisces, which is not emphasized in either zodiac.

In both the Tropical and Sidereal zodiacs, the Moon is in Aries, and the vision begins with Mars near the Midheaven. A pro­nounced martial theme would be expected. However, no such in­fluence seems evident (other than flitting phrases in §§4-5, e.g., \"falchions,\" or swords) until § 14, as Crowley withdraws from the vision. At that point, the Mars symbolism is unmistakable. This is an example of the ambient quality of the \"astral environment\" (patterns then dominant in collective subconsciousness), discussed in my introductory remarks. That is, the \"raging of thousands and thousands of mighty warriors\" does not appear to be indigenous to the c:ethyr itself (which is Venus-themed) but, rather, shows the martial conditioning of the astral plane at the time of the working. A reasonable conclusion is that the 27th iEthyr has no intrinsic connection to Mars ideas. (By the time the vision was concluding, Mars was no longer near the Midheaven; but, in either zodiac, the Moon was in Aries.) Foremost in the Qabalistic symbolism of this vision is that of the Moon, primarily (but not exclusively) manifested through em­blems of Pisces. Although Pisces is not a traditional dignity of Lu­na, Qabalists attribute Pisces to Atu XVIII of the Tarot, called \"The Moon.\" By the Enochian symbolism of the c:ethyr we would rather have expected Venus than Luna; for the c:ethyr corresponds to Netzach in Yetzirah, and two of the letters in the name ZAA correspond to Taurus, the night-house of Venus. It would have been no surprise at all to see the symbolism of Taurus most pro­nounced, this being not only Venus-themed but also the exaltation of the Moon. But that is not what we find here. Instead the rela­tionship is more or less reversed. Instead of Taurus, the central theme is Pisces, which is not only linked to the Moon through Ta­rot, but is the exaltation, or place of highest alchemical expression, of Venus. It is also the first path that an aspirant crosses in the ap­proach to Netzach, the sephirah corresponding to Venus. ZAA or ::p;; =Leo, Taurus, Taurus. It enumerates to 7 + 1 + 1 = 9, the number of the Moon! This is a striking corrobora­tion. In fact, it is the key to everything in the vision. §§1-3: The key to the first three verses (and, thereby, to much of the vi­sion) is in the threefold symbolism of the Moon on the Tree of Life:"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"124 Visions & Voices Gimel, l (Atu II, The Priestess, linking Kether to Tiphereth), Yesod (se­phirah 9, attributed to the Moon), and Qoph, p (Atu XVIII, \"The Moon,\" attributed to Pisces, linking Netzach and Malkuth). As Crowley summa­rized in The Book ofThoth: The Moon, partaking as she does of the highest and the lowest, and fill­ing all the space between, is the most universal of the Planets. In her higher aspect, she occupies the place of the Link between the human and divine, as shown in Atu II. In this Trump, her lowest avatar, she joins the earthy sphere of Netzach with Malkuth, the culmination in matter of all superior forms. In these first three paragraphs of the vision, we see this three-fold manifestation of the goddess as Gimel, Y esod, and Qoph. \"One person am I, and three Gods.\" She is an outer manifestation of Babalon Herself, expressed as the Threefold Goddess who will be particularly familiar to my readers with pagan interests or background. And, lest we forget, Bi­nah, the sephirah attributed to the Great Mother, is numbered 3. 1. There is an angel with rainbow wings, and his dress is green with silver, a green veil over silver armour. Flames of many­coloured fire dart from him in all directions. It is a woman of some thirty years old, and she has the moon for a crest, and the moon is blazoned on her heart, and her sandals are curved silver, liRe the moon. A paragraph especially indicative of Gimel, but also of all three expressions of the Moon. She is vested in the green of Venus and in flame (both confirming the Netzach correspondence of the reth­yr), but otherwise in silver armor of the Moon. The lunar crest at her brow is of Gimel; the Moon on her \"heart\" corresponds to Yesod as the middle of the three; and the silver, crescent sandals correspond to Qoph; for Pisces rules the feet in astrology. 2. And she cries: Lonely am I and cold in the wilderness of the stars. For I am the queen of all them that dwell in Heaven, and the queen of all them that are pure upon earth, and the queen of all the sorcerers of hell. A paragraph especially indicative of Y esod, but also of all three expressions of the Moon.

I am the daughter of Nuit, the lady of the stars. And I am the Bride of them that are vowed unto loneliness. And I am the mother of the Dog Cerberus. One person am I, and three gods. A paragraph especially indicative of Qoph, but also of all three expressions of the Moon. The first sentence refers to Gimel, The Priestess; the second to Y esod as 9; and the third to Pisces through Hecate, the goddess of the dark and waning Moon of Qoph and the mother of Cerberus. Throughout much of this vision, it is easiest to think of her as Hecate per se, alternating at times with Di­ana/ Artemis. 4. And thou who hast blasphemed me shalt suffer bnowing me. For I am cold as thou art cold, and burn with thy fire. Oh, when shall the war of the Aires and the elements be accomplished? The Moon reflects that which is shone upon it. The brief mention of \"war\" likely refers to the struggle within Crowley to open to a different level of consciousness. The \"Aires and the elements\" are both parts of the Enochian system, anchored in the same set of tablets. These tablets (gate­ways between Assiah and the deeper Worlds) form the four 'Watchtowers' interfacing between the cube-symbolized material universe and the concentric spheres of the 30 rethyrs surrounding it. These Watchtowers are most commonly treated as elemental, but their letters are also used to form the names of the Governors of each of the rethyrs. Intuitively, this \"war\" seems to me to be that inner struggle be­tween reason and the moorings of the ego (Ruach) on the one side, and the realm of superconsciousness (Neshamah) on the other­the bringing into relationship of the circle and cross, or the sphere and the cube. s.

Merging the two ideas, this \"rope\" forms that vertical tie between the Crown and the Heart that is Gimel, which could not be severed. Instead, there is described the \"son\" of the virgin Moon, whose attributes are those ofVenus as Netzach. 6. All this time intolerable rays are shooting forth to beat me bacb or destroy me; but I am encased in an egg of blue-violet, and my form is the form of a man with the head of a golden hawb. While I have been observing this, the goddess has bept up a continuous wail, libe the baying of a thousand hounds; and now her voice is deep and guttural and hoarse, and she breathes very rapidly words that I cannot hear. I can hear some of them now: This is a standard protective technique Crowley learned as part of the astral scrying methods of the Golden Dawn. The enclosing egg and the hawk-headed image were commonly assumed by the Adeptus Minor journeying into realms of vision. The blue-violet color of the egg is that indigo (often called black) that is the color of the egg of akasha, or Spirit, the Quintessence or so-called fifth element that crowns the pyramid and the pentagram. The symbolism of the hunt (here and in verses following) is re­flective of Diana/ Artemis, the Moon as goddess of the hunt. 7.

Zinc flames are the red-violet color attributed to Qoph, p, and Pis­ces in the King Scale. The image here presented was later adopted by Crowley and Harris for Atu XIV, \"Art\" or \"Temperance,\" cor­responding to Samekh, 0, and Sagittarius. This sign of \"The Arch­er\" was, among ancient Greeks and Romans, ruled not by Jupiter, but by Artemis or Diana, goddess of the bow. The symbolic rela­tionships between Sagittarius and the Moon, thus, run much deep­er than might normally be supposed. Furthermore, in Qabalah, the 25th Path of Samekh is that which opens from the Sphere of the Moon in Y esod unto the Sphere of the Sun in Tiphereth. As such, it is the chief focus of the Portal Ritual (a prelude to the full admission to Tiphereth and the Second Order). The image given in this vision much resembles that actual­ly used in the Portal Ritual in the G.D. at the time that Crowley passed through it, despite the fact that other images for Atu XIV are much more common in the popular mind (e.g., that published by Waite). The rainbow is a common ensign of Samekh. It is symbolically equated to that other \"bow\" of the Moon-goddess. The Hebrew name for Sagittarius is mvp, Qesheth, formed of the letters corre­sponding to the three lowest paths on the Tree of Life, and mean­ing \"a bow\" -interpreted both as \"the rainbow of promise,\" and as the archer's \"bow\" that launches the \"arrow of aspiration\" up the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life, commonly called the \"Path of the Arrow.\" This \"arrow of aspiration,\" or Samekh, is \"launched\" from Yesod, 1,0\\ which, written as 1,0-\\ or Yod-Sod, may be read as \"the secret hand.\" This rainbow, like the \"opalescent\" effect mentioned, is a common phenomenon experienced in the path of Samekh, as the solar rays of Tiphereth shine upon and through the waters of Y esod. They who successfully complete this path earn the symbol­ic title Hodos Chamelionis; that is, they walk the rainbow-colored \"way of the chameleon.\" The rose of 49 (7x7) petals is that of Venus and Babalon."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"128 Visions & Voices Crowley initially encountered it, most likely, in his Adeptus Minor initiation in Paris early in 1900, where it appeared both in the cen­ter of the black floor of the Vault of Adepts, and as the design on the head of the pastas of the Hidden Master. He seems rather quickly to have understood it as an emblem of the goddess, both in her Venus aspect and in all those senses wherein She corresponds to Binah. Finally, something may be said about the \"voice\" which \"rises to a shriek.\" This has been observed as a common phenomenon in higher aspirational states, especially those ascending toward Tiph­ereth or beyond. Sometimes it is a spontaneous physical expres­sion of kundalini activity, or a method to create higher-pitched vi­bration in the physical and astral bodies to accommodate the high­er vibration of spiritual force attempting to incarnate therein. 9. And now she lifts her head, and raises her hands to heaven, and cries: 0 Mother, wilt thou never have compassion on the children of earth? Was it not enough that the Rose should be red with the blood of thine heart, and that its petals should be by 7 and by7? She addresses Nuit as \"Mother.\" (In §3 She identified herself as \"the daughter ofNuit.\") 10. She is weeping, weeping. And the tears grow and fill the whole stone with moons. I can see nothing and hear nothing for the tears, though she Reeps on praying. \"TaRe of these pearls, treasure them in thine heart.

In particular, pearls are symbolic of Binah, and are here to be treasured in the heart, an obvious symbol of Tiphereth. 11.

And now all these things are there at once in the same place and time. The dragon symbolizes the \"Black Dragon\" stage of alchemy, which is one of putrefaction, or the breaking down or dying of the old state in preparation for the new birth yet to come. It corre­sponds symbolically to Scorpio and the path of Nun, J, opening from Netzach to Tiphereth. This, too, is a phenomenon character­istic of the Portal stage to which so many of these symbols refer. \"I watch, and watch; and nothing happens.\" There is a seeming suspension of movement due to a latency wherein, for a time, nothing whatsoever seems to be happening. All movement is oc­curring under the surface. See how this naturally evolves into the very next sentence, in § 11; and then, finally, the brilliant phenom­ena of § 12. These are phenomena of dhyana. 1 They herald the opening of the final gates into Tiphereth. Lignum aloe is an in­cense of Samekh. A key, coordinating all of the symbols in § 10-12, is that, after the phenomena of Scorpio (Nun, J, opening from Netzach), it is by the path of Samekh, 0, opening from Y esod, that one actually en­ters Tiphereth. 13. Now a veil of olive and silver is drawn over the stone, only I hear the voice of the angel receding, very sweet and faint and sorrowful, saying: Far off and lonely in the secret stone is the un­�nown, and interpenetrated is the �nowledge with the will and the understanding. I am alone. I am lost, because I am all and in all; and my veil is woven of the green earth and the web of stars. I love; and I am denied, for I have denied myself.

Olive is the color of the watery part of Malkuth, which opens along the path of Qoph, Pisces, toward Netzach. Silver is the color of the Moon. But \"olive, flecked gold\" is the color of Netzach it­self in the Princess Scale. Could there be a relationship or mixing, or even a misperceiving of the color? The words of the angel are the fruit of this particular dhyana that Crowley experienced, and are so rich in potential meaning that I shall scarcely comment on them at all, other than to refer them to the reader for meditation. They reflect one facet of the larger process through which Crow­ley was passing in these visions, the confirmation and intensifica­tion of the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel and the opening thereby of the Abyss, with the eventual ini­tiation into Binah. \"Stone\" is a Qabalistic code word for intimate union. His Da'ath (\"knowledge,\" gnosis) is said to be interpene­trated with the consciousness of Chokmah and Binah, \"the will and the understanding\"; that is, his Ruach interpenetrated with Su­pernal consciousness. She gives \"the word of the <eon\" as Makhashanah. Crowley al­ready knew that the word of the lEon of Horus is Abrahadabra.

Among its chief themes are: transformation; the opening and shutting of doors; remapping of reality; and tran­scendence of the arbitrary, superficial, and transient. Not every vision undertaken with Pluto on an angle will have these extreme qualities. Most people (even dedicated magicians) are not quite ready, on most occasions, for such a thorough re­mapping. But it is gratifying to see that a vision that does have these qualities in abundance also has an angular Pluto. Also, Mars is much closer to the Ascendant than it appears. Due to the obliquity of the ecliptic, the 1st House appears (in celes­tial longitude) to be much larger than it actually is. Space appears to be \"squeezed\" because of the angle at which it is viewed. This is a common phenomenon, well known to astrologers. Mars' actu­al altitude is only about 7° below the eastern horizon, and he rose 36 minutes later, near the end of the time when this vision was be­ing received. The Moon continues in her increase, and is now less than one sign (about two days) from Full Moon. In the Tropical Zodiac, she is in Taurus, which makes no thematic sense for the present vision. In the Sidereal Zodiac, she remains in Aries: Sun and Moon are both in Mars-ruled constellations. This is entirely appropriate for the present vision which begins with woe, wages war in its middle,"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"134 Visions & Voices and consummates in overflowing blood! - yet these themes are equally well explained by the rising Mars, regardless of zodiacal concerns. Where the Aries Moon does shine is through salient themes distinctively corresponding to Tarot Key IV, The Emperor, at­tributed to Aries. Besides the obvious Mars themes mentioned above, particular elements more specifically related to Aries and The Emperor include the sulfurous flavor of the whole, and the themes of patriarchal authority expressed through the central char­acter. Venus' opposition to Neptune is still within 1°, but is past the peak it reached the day before, and is not prominently placed in this chart. As might be expected, it seems to have little to do with this vision. One astrological factor of a fairly obscure and controversial na­ture is, nonetheless, so extraordinary that I cannot fail to mention it. In 1977, astronomers discovered a small body, which they named Chiron, orbiting between Saturn and Uranus. It is too small to be thought a proper \"planet,\" but is located where no as­teroids are known to roam. \"Planetoid\" is probably the best label for it. At the time of its discovery, Chiron seemed to be an entirely new type of solar system body in a class of its own. 1 In intervening years, most astrologers' conclusions concerning the possible sig­nificance of Chiron have centered on the name given it, Chiron having been the mythic teacher of Greek gods and heroes. This pedagogic quality is supported by my own work with the planet­oid. It is prominent in horoscopes of those who become \"gurus\" in one or another area of life, and those who hungrily seek to learn answers.2 Chiron's transits behave substantially the same as those of Uranus, though of lesser intensity. The point, at the moment, is that, during this vision of the 26th lEthyr, Chiron, \"the teacher of the gods,\" was at 0°01' Aquarius in the Sidereal Zodiac! At the hour of the previous day's vision, it 1 Astronomers now recognize a class of solar system body which (in honor of Chiron) they call centaurs. These display some characteristics of asteroids but also some characteristics of comets, and may be remnants of one or more comets exploded in the past. 2 Crowley's natal Chiron was at Sidereal 1 °16' Aries, a mere 8' from opposite his Venus, and closely square his Mars.

DES or J:i'\"\"\\ = Spirit, Virgo, Gemini. It enumerates to 4 + 8 + 60 = 72. Given the importance of H1i1' in this vision, we note that 72 signifies Tetragrammaton in numerous ways. H1i1' is said to be divided into 72 parts (the Shem ha-M'phorash, or \"Divided Name\"). 72 is also the value of a word puzzle combining one, two, three, and all four of its letters: ' + il' + 1i1' + rli11', and of ii1i1' spelled in full (each letter spelled out) in a way unique to one of the Four Worlds: 'il 1'1 1i1 11'. Of the three letters, the initial one, D, corresponding to Spirit or Akasha, is the most evident; see notes on § l below. The symbol­ism of the other two letter-symbols is less evident. Crowley noted, however, that the three letters together declare the nature of the chief deities on the Stele of Revealing which appears at the end of the vision (§14), Akasha being symbolic ofNuit; the minute point of Y od, the Virgin-Soul, being expressive of Hadit; and Gemini representing the twin-god, Heru-Ra-Ha. The 26th lEthyr corresponds to Tiphereth in Y etzirah. This is very evident in this vision, and will receive comment in individual notes that follow. In brief, the rethyr, as part of the ongoing pro­cess of transitioning Crowley from Adepthood to Mastery, focuses on the relative untruth - relative \"outemess\" - of Tiphereth in comparison to Binah. The eagle, the traditional animal ensign of the god Jupiter, represents H1i1', especially as the Christian Jeho­vah as that idea exists reflected in the human mind - particularly in Crowley's mind at that time. Jehovah is here portrayed as the Gnostic Demiurge at his worst. ii1i1' is the Divine Name of Tiph­ereth in the oldest known attributions, preserved in modem times in the composite form nl711 i11�� ii1i1'. He is shown here with a gaggle of symbols of Tiphereth, of the Sun in general, and of the element of Air. 1.

Symbols of Spirit, Quintessence, or Akasha - all of which are names for the same ONE THING, corresponding to the first letter of the cethyr's name, D. The pentagram by itself is a symbol of this, showing the cross of the four elements crowned by scintillating Spirit, the \"fifth essence,\" from which the four emerged and to which they return. This, in fact, is a suitable metaphor for the en­tire vision: For the eagle declares itself to be an expression of the four elements, emerges from the heart of the brilliant-black angel, and cries out in despair for its return to the Night (N.O.X., the su­pernal consciousness characteristic of Binah) which is denied it, yet which it recognizes \"above\" it. The color of this angel is not ordinary black, but a black that is \"so bright that I cannot look upon it.\" This is a distinctive charac­teristic of Akasha's so-called \"black\" egg, best represented chro­matically as vivid indigo. The Sanskrit akasha, which one authori­ty renders as \"primordial spatial substance\" (Nuit), comes from the root kas, meaning \"to shine.\" This brilliant, shining quality is a virtue of its appearance to astral sight. It is the \"unspeakable brightness\" mentioned in the Call of the 30 lEthyrs. The language in this paragraph particularly, and through the rest of the vision more generally, resembles phrases in the Enochian Calls, which Crowley, by now, had been reciting for several days. His concentrated and repeated exposure to the dis­tinctive syntax was beginning to have its effect. \"Righteousness in Beauty\" is a direct reference to Tiphereth, Beauty (or to Chesed­in-Tiphereth, since tzedeq, \"righteousness,\" is the Hebrew name for Jupiter). Sight, which here is \"burnt out,\" is attributed to Fire. Hearing, which also has been compromised, is attributed to Spirit. Thus, \"the vision and the voice\" is of the two highest of the five ele­ments. Both sight and hearing are here disabled by overwhelm.

Many are their colours, and their colour is as molten gold, when all is said. Is not He one, one and alone, in whom the brightness of your countenance is as 1,728 petals of fire? The image is quite symbolic of Aries and The Emperor, not only because the figure on that card is an intentional glyph of alchemi­cal Sulphur ( � ), but also because the fire and molten gold are characteristic of Mars, which rules Aries, and the Sun, which is exalted therein. The name \"He\" is a reference to the Hebrew �1i1, hu, which means \"he.\" It is a title of Kether, and enumerates to 12. This is relevant because the quite impressive-looking number 1,728 is simply 123-the powers of the Name �1i1, as of the zodiac, mani­fest in solid, three-dimensional form. The text gives a quite beauti­ful and extraordinary chakra-like image! 3. Also he spa�e the curse, folding his wings across and crying: Is not the son the enemy of his father?

A complex reference to the four letters in the Tetragrammaton, which is now introduced for the first time in this vision-but as a curse! There are also likely keys here from Crow­ley's own subconscious mind, laced with its flagrant Oedipal ele­ments; and of his identification with the image of Horus as succes­sor of his slain father, Osiris, which partially arose therefrom. \" ... there is neither wisdom [Chokmah] nor understanding [Bi­nah] nor knowledge [Da'ath] in this house [Beth, ::J, Mercury, the mind].\" In other words, the thing now to be dragged forth and cursed is the intellect devoid of supernal inspiration.1 Jehovah (r11i1') is here symbolized not so much by the number 4, as by 2, duality; for he is the Demiurge, and thus (as conventional Gnostic doctrine defines Him) the blasphemy against the true Unity. 1 It is also implicitly devoid of the Crown, Kether; for n:l.711 i!J':J ilr.J:m, ·'Chokmah, Binah, and Da'ath,\" has the same numeration, 620, as 1n:::>, Kether."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"138 Visions & Voices 4. Therefore whoso worshippeth thee is accursed.

And he shall be mingled with dung and spread upon the earth, so that the herbs of the earth may feed thereof and die; and he shall be burnt ut­terly with fire, and the ashes thereof shall calcine the children of flame, that even in hell may be found an overflowing lamenta­tion. These four curses are of the four elements, viz., Air, Water, Earth, and Fire in the same sequence that the elements are distributed on the Enochian elemental tablets. The passages are accursed expres­sions of r!1il', which qabalistically conveys those elements. They are also articulated in the style of the penalty clauses of Masonic oaths, some of the language of which is actually included in this paragraph. The idea seems to be that someone who worships this outer, delusional veil, as if it were underlying REALITY, will be­come caught up in its mortality. All that is not THE ONE, the Cen­ter, Purusha, &c. will pass. Thus speaks the angel who is a symbol of Akasha, a higher (or deeper) point of view. 5. And now on the breast of the Angel is a golden egg between the blacbness of the wings, and that egg grows and grows all over the cethyr. And it breabs, and within there is a golden eagle. Now emerges the eagle of Jove that, in this vision, is Jehovah Himself expressed in Tiphereth, first appearing in solar symbols (as a golden egg from the heart of the Akasha-angel). The eagle is the Kerub of Air, the element corresponding to Tiphereth ( espe­cially Tiphereth in Y etzirah, to which this rethyr corresponds). 6. And he cries: Woe! woe! woe! Yea, woe unto the world! For there is no sin, and there is no salvation. My plumes are libe waves of gold upon the sea. My eyes are brighter than the sun. My tongue is swifter than the lightning. Serial repetitions of\"Woe\" are common in Enochian passages.

In the present pas­sage, however, the \"woe\" is fourfold, corresponding, again, to the fourfold Tetragrammaton. 7. Yet am I hemmed in by the armies of night, singing, singing praises unto Him that is smitten by the thunderbolt of the abyss. Is not the sby clear behind the sun? These clouds that burn thee up, these rays that scorch the brains of men with blindness; these are heralds before my face of the dissolution and the night. All through this set of paragraphs, the point of view appears to be Tiphereth. \" ... hemmed in by the armies of night\" is astronomical­ly accurate regarding the Sun in space. It also reflects the relation­ship ofTiphereth to Binah, and ofL.V.X., the Qabalistic Light, to N.O.X., the Qabalistic Night. This concept is echoed in other sen­tences later in the paragraph. It is not the Demiurge (here also seemingly equated with the human ego) that is any longer wor­shipped and praised in song, but the Adept \"that is smitten by the thunderbolt of the abyss.\" The annihilation in the Abyss is an even greater, further step than the illumination in Tiphereth. 8. Ye are all blinded by my glory; and though ye treasure in your heart the sacred word that is the last lever of the bey to the little door beyond the abyss, yet ye gloss and comment thereupon; for the light itself is but illusion. Truth itself is but illusion. Yea, these be the great illusions beyond life and space and time. 9. Let thy lips blister with my words! Are they not meteors in thy brain? Bacb, bacb from the face of the accursed one, who am I; bacb into the night of my father, into the silence; for all that ye deem right is left, forward is bacbward, upward is downward. The word is likely N.O.X.; but the experience of it as \"the last lever of the key to the little door,\" &c., is not the same as one's ideas about it in advance. A reversal of consciousness is required. 10. I am the great god adored of the holy ones. Yet am I the ac­cursed one, child of the elements and not their father. Continues the discussion of rl1i1' expressed in Yetzirah, the outer representation of Jehovah as worshipped exoterically. The \"holy ones\" likely are the Chasidim, i.e., adepts (in the lesser sense that"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"140 Visions & Voices this term was understood in the Golden Dawn). The eagle-angel is \"child of the elements,\" i.e., the product of the microcosmic view of things, something adorable to the outer and lesser, but a false eidolon for any deeper truth. 11. 0 my mother! wilt thou not have pity upon me? Wilt thou not shield me? For I am nat?ed, I am manifest, I am profane. 0 my father! wilt not thou withdraw me? I am extended, I am double, I am profane. Threatened with exposure for its inauthenticity, this projection of the intellect appeals to something deeper and truer for its salva­tion. That is, as Tiphereth, the child, he calls upon Binah and Chokmah (the Mother and Father, respectively) for aid; or to say it another way, he calls upon Nuit and Hadit, She as his refuge, and He as the unextended Light. Ultimately, this appeal is futile. The fiction, rightly adored by those not yet attained to it, is representative of the very fabrication (or veil) of intellect that these visions are progressively exposing. 12. Woe, woe unto me! These are they that hear not prayer. It is I that have heard all prayer alway, and there is none to answer me. Woe unto me! Woe unto me! Accursed am I unto the CEons! The \"Woe\" is here merely double, and no longer fourfold, even as the eagle said in the previous verse that he is double. He is absorb­ing the point of view expressed in the angel's earlier statement, \"Thou art not 4 but 2.\" This image of \"God\" (actually a projection of the human ego) appears pitiful in the face of its pending disso­lution. The anguish is human anguish at the loss of its prior ideal. 13. All this time this brilliant eagle-headed god has been at­tacbed, seemingly, by invisible people, for he is wounded now and again, here and there; little streams of fresh blood come out over the feathers of his breast. And the smobe of the blood is gradually filling the JEthyr with a crimson veil. There is a scroll over the top, saying: Ecclesia abho\"et a sanguine; and there is another scroll below it in a language of which I do not !:?now the sounds. The meaning is, Not as they have understood. The transformation begins. The blood of the eagle is spilled in his slaying.

Tiphereth is not the final step of the inward journey. One must, in ripe time, give one's blood (the whole of the substance of one's life) to Babalon. Crimson is the color of Binah in the King Scale. This eventual­ly darkens to the black attributed to Her in the Queen Scale. The Latin phrase, Ecclesia abhorret a sanguine (\"The Church abhors [shrinks from] blood\"), enumerates to 215. Of the normal Hebrew associations with this number, the most interesting is probably niT, zarach, meaning, \"to shine; to rise [as the Sun]; to give light; sunrise;\" it is the root ofniT7.J, \"east.\" 14. The blood is thicl:?er and darl:?er now, and it is becoming clot­ted and bloc!:?, so that everything is blotted out; because it coag­ulates, coagulates. And then at the top there steals a dawn of pure night-blue, - Oh, the stars, the stars in it deeply set! - and drives the blood down; so that all round the top of the oval gradually dawns the figure of our Lady Nuit, and beneath her is the flaming winged dis!:?, and below the altar of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, even as it is upon the Stele of Revealing. But below is the supine figure of Seb, into whom is concentrated all that clotted blood. This \"blood,\" being originally the vital, life-giving and life-sus­taining fluid flowing through the veins of the slain shell of exoter­ic religion, is becoming denser and darker. It is precipitating down the planes, manifesting in Assiah, in the sensual world, concen­trated down about Seb, the earth. (This is one interpretation of the alchemical coagula.) It serves as the instrument or medium of the manifestation of the symbols of the New lEon, the birth of the \"new world order.\" 15. And there comes a voice: It is the dawn of the ceon. The ceons of cursing are passed away. Force and fire, strength and sight, these are for the servants of the Star and the Snal:?e. Tiphereth is this \"golden dawn\" -but now purified, cleansed of its old, restrictive forms. One might wonder if a horoscope for the conclusion of this vision might not be taken as the \"birth chart of the lEon of Horus.\" In one sense, at least, it was so for Crowley.

OVERVIEW: This vision was obtained on the evening of the same day as that of the 261h lEthyr. Therefore, many of the astro­logical factors remain the same. Major aspects and the Moon's phase and sign remain unchanged from the previous vision. The chief difference is in the angular planets which, in this case, seem to give little clue to the vision: Though the vision commenced with the planet Saturn precisely on the Midheaven, there are no particularly remarkable Saturn themes of the vision, other than the relatively minor themes of weight and burden at one point and the severity of the figure at the end (when Saturn was no longer culminating). In fact, the only decisive confirmation of any of the main astrological themes in the vision is the persistence of warrior and other martial themes sprinkled throughout, which again would conform to the Sidereal positions of the Moon in Ar­ies and the Sun in Scorpio, and to the Geburah correspondence of the rethyr.

Thus, for this vision, he would have concen­trated his attention on the three Enochian letters il, ), and L, and on their correspondences of Capricorn, Caput Draconis, and Sagit­tarius. These, in tum, would have brought instantly into his trained mind many other associations, especially from Tarot. 1 But the symbolism of these individual letters is fairly absent throughout the remainder of the vision, with one exception: Crow­ley, in his own commentaries, revealed a tendency to equate Caput Draconis, the Dragon's Head, with \"the head of the Beast.\" For even more obvious reasons, he equated Leo with the lion-headed Great Beast, 666. Not only did he intermix their symbolic associa­tions in places, but he actually confused his own jottings of their already-similar astrological glyphs, b6 and 6/_. Thus, the pro­nounced Leo/Beast themes of this vision may well be a natural de­velopment in his psyche of the symbol of Caput Draconis. Theoretically, the sephirothic attribution of this 25th lEthyr is Geburah in Yetzirah. From reading the vision, there is no doubt that its symbolism is mostly that of the 19th Path of the Tree of Life corresponding to the Hebrew letter 'D, Teth, and the Xlth Trump of Tarot, traditionally called Strength. Does this clear ex­ample contradict the Qabalistic model we are employing to exam­ine these visions? Quite the contrary. For the Tarot Keys tradition­ally called Strength and Justice (and still known to Crowley by these names at the time of this vision in 1909) are both connected on the Tree of Life to the fifth sephirah, which is also called both Diyn, r1, Justice, and Geburah, i111::Jl, Strength. Even were the vision's pronounced military and other Geburan characteristics ig­nored, it is not, we hold, a stretch to view this vision of the Trump called Strength as reflecting also the nature of the sephirah called Strength. (See also the notes on §16 below.) 1 To see these symbols juxtaposed, the student can lay out the three Tarot trumps corresponding to these letters: XV, The Devil; II, The Priestess; and XIV, Art. (The same can be done for each �thyr, of course.)"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"146 Visions & Voices 0. There is nothing in the stone but the pale gold of the Rosy Cross. Crowley began these visions by gazing into the center of a large topaz on which was engraved the symbol of the Rosy Cross. 1. Now there comes an Angel with bright wings, that is the Angel of the 25th Aire. And all the aire is a dar� olive about him, li�e an alexandrite stone. He bears a pitcher or amphora. And now there comes another Angel upon a white horse, and yet again another Angel upon a bloc� bull. And now there comes a lion and swallows the two latter angels up. The first angel goes to the lion and closes his mouth. And behind them are arrayed a great company of Angels with silver spears, li�e a forest. And the Angel says: Blow, all ye trumpets, for I will loose my hands from the mouth of the lion, and his roaring shall en�indle the worlds. The symbols corresponding to the letters of VTI are those of Cap­ricorn, Caput Draconis, and Sagittarius. The first and last corre­spond to the Tarot Trumps called The Devil and Temperance. The latter is generally recognized as an image of the Holy Guardian Angel; and the former is, in fact, the reflection of that same Angel under a veil of darkness. They are thus, as it were, the black and white pillars of the temple, or the night and day expressions of the same idea. The first angel is the distinctive angel of the rethyr. Alexandrite is attributed to Gemini. The amphora (a classic-style two-handled jar, as for carrying water &c.) is commonly shown on The Star card. These clue us to what is occurring in the vision: The central theme of this vision is the letter Teth, D, Leo, which will be explored in various ways in the paragraphs below. The angel is equivalent to the woman who joins the lion on the Xlth Trump, traditionally called Strength. That woman is symbolic of the path of Gimel, l, The Priestess, descending from Kether to Tiphereth and intersecting Teth, D, uniting the powers of the Moon (l) and the Sun (D, Leo, ruled by the Sun). Two other paths also descend from the supernals to Tiphereth, crossing Teth in the pro­cess: Zayin, l, Gemini (evidenced here by the alexandrite color) and Heh, i1, Aquarius (reflected in the amphora borne by the an­gel). Thus, he (should it not be \"she\"?) consolidates these three paths of l, l, and i1 intersecting Teth, D."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"lltale gold of the Rosy � t the center of a large Ilk Rosy Cross.

The angel upon the black bull corresponds to A'ayin, lJ, Capricorn, the bull of earthen Taurus not atypically appearing to substitute for other Earth-sign animals. 1 By a twist in the seer's mind, the bull also may have been suggested by the Hebrew V (1), corresponding to Taurus, be­ing substituted for the Enochian V, D. The white and black of the horse and bull echo the white and black pillars of the temple. The lion that arises between them corresponds to the Dragon's Head in Crowley's symbolism, and thus to the middle letter T. Further­more, the Hebrew T, '0, corresponding to Leo, seems to have been overlapped in the seer's mind with the Enochian T, ). Both of these substitutions, the V and the T, were done in a way that did no actual damage to the symbolism that was ex­pected, but that led to an alternate expression of the same symbol­ism that incorporated the Hebrew as well as the Enochian. Teth, '0, is usually rendered \"serpent\" (hence the lion-serpent characteristics of this Leo-attributed letter). But, according to Dr. Karl Feyerabend, '0 actually means \"a coiling, twisting\" - that which is coiled like a snake, but not so much the snake itself. This is an important distinction, for the literal meaning of the Sanskrit kundalini is also \"coiled.\" Teth, '0, the solar-lion-serpent force that The 32 Paths of Wisdom calls \"the consciousness of the secret of all spiritual activities,\" is simply another term for kundalini. Therefore, it is important that, as we are told from the start, this central letter is going to devour, or subsume, the other two, there­by becoming the main character of this drama. This devouring and sublimation is exactly what the central channel of kundalini, called sushumna, does with respect to the energies of the lateral channels, ida and pingala. At once, the angel of the rethyr assumes the same relationship to the lion as the Shakti-woman in the traditional Strength card ('0): the primary symbol-image of the vision is estab­lished. In a passage reminiscent of the language of The Apoca­lypse, amidst blasting \"trumpets,\" we receive the hint that the voice of this lion, the roar of this Great Beast, \"shall enkindle the worlds.\" (Put this idea in context of the Vision of the 26th JEthyr, just received by him a mere six hours earlier on the same day.) 1 In my own astral vision work, it has not been unusual for similar earthen, homed animals to appear when Taurus or Capricorn symbols are invoked. One of the most memorable and, at the time, painful of these was a rhinoceros!"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"148 Visions & Voices 2. Then the trumpets blow, and the wind rises and whistles terri­bly. It is a blue wind with silver specRs; and it blows through the whole IEthyr. But through it one perceives the lion, which has be­come as a raging flame. These words describe the unleashing of kundalini as a \"raging flame.\" Blue with silver interwoven indicates Gimel, l, the Moon, The Priestess in Tarot. The woman in the Xlth Trump, to whom this angel corresponds, is also an expression of Gimel. The rising, whistling wind is an intensified infusion of the Light borne along this path of l. Its effect on the lion is quite remarkable and under­standable, when all of these symbols are integrated and their meaning comprehended. What has Gimel to do with the theme of Geburah to which we have ultimately related this rethyr? Everything. One of the rarely discussed arcana of the Order of the Rosy Cross is that the word Gimel, 'I7Jl, is a formula of the advance of the Adeptus Minor, 5°=6°. It is through the path of Gimel that the Lesser Adept has experienced the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardi­an Angel; and that path continues to lie ever before the Adept, the one central and pervasive reality of his or her inner life. Yet two paths, Mem 7J and Lamed 'I, also beckon the Adept, in ripe time, to the Sphere of Geburah and the 6°=5° Grade. These three letters spell 'I7Jl, Gimel, as if to say: \"Yea, walk these paths unto Strength; but lose not sight of that all-encompassing ONE IDEA that characterizes your Adepthood.\" 3. And he roareth in an unRnown tongue. But this is the interpre­tation thereof: Let the stars be burnt up in the fire of my nostrils! Let all the gods and the archangels and the angels and the spirits that are on the earth, and above the earth, and below the earth, that are in all the heavens and in all the hells, let them be as motes dancing in the beam of mine eye! It is common, in such heightened vision, for the auditory centers of the brain to receive stimuli that are not comprehensible and that seem like inarticulate sounds, yet for the magician to have direct telepathic awareness of the meaning. (See Crowley's parenthetical note appended at the end of the vision.) The left and right nostrils, in the symbolism of the R.R. et A.C., correspond to Venus and Mars, respectively.

I am he that swalloweth up death and victory. I have slain the crowned goat, and drunb up the great sea. Libe the ash of dried leaves the worlds are blown before me. Thou hast passed by me, and thou hast not bnown me. Woe unto thee, that I have not devoured thee altogether! \"Victory\" is Netzach; and \"Death\" is Atu XIII, the path of Nun, J, Scorpio, which opens into Netzach from Tiphereth. The \"great sea\" refers to the waters of Hod; and the \"crowned goat\" refers to Atu XV, the path of A'ayin, l7, Capricorn, which emanates Hod from Tiphereth. The Sun-ruled lion thus identifies himself with the solar consciousness of Tiphereth, which, he says (invoking tradi­tional ceremonial language) Crowley has \"passed by\" and yet not \"known,\" i.e., not truly understood. Continuing the theme that the Adept ultimately must be dissolved into the nothingness of the Abyss, the lion utters the last sentence of the paragraph. 5. On my head is the crown, 419 rays far-darting. And my body is the body of the Snabe, and my soul is the soul of the Crowned Child. Though an Angel in white robes leadeth me, who shall ride upon me but the Woman of Abominations? Who is the Beast? Am not I one more than he? In his hand is a sword that is a boob. In his hand is a spear that is a cup of fornication. Upon his mouth is set the great and terrible seal. And he hath the secret of V. His ten horns spring from five points, and his eight heads are as the charioteer of the West. Thus doth the fire of the sun temper the spear of Mars, and thus shall he be worshipped, as the warrior lord of the sun. Yet in him is the woman that devoureth with her water all the fire of Cod. \"Who is the Beast? Am not I one more than he?\" 419 is the value of Teth spelled out as a word, n''D; and the common Hebrew word for \"Beast\" (as in Genesis 1 :25) is n\"n, chaiyath = 418. n''D = 419 =418+1. Teth means \"snake\" and is Leo, ruled by the Sun; so it also has the soul of the crowned solar child of Tiphereth. The \"sword that is a book\" is Liber Legis. Crowley wrote that the \"great and terri­ble seal\" is the Seal of Babalon, the seven-pointed star with the"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"150 Visions & Voices letters of her name in its angles, and the mystery of seven 7 s in the midst.

The pe­nultimate sentence describes a collaboration of Tiphereth and Geburah (the Sun and Mars), even as these are blended in the name Ra-Hoor. The final sen­tence refers to the feminine mystery of Binah that is deeper than all the solar fire of the Adept­hood of Tiphereth. 1 6.

After the references to fire in the prior para­graph, \"teeth\" likely also is a hint at Shin, tv, which corresponds to fire and literally means \"tooth.\" The \"four pillars of water\" refer to the four rivers that flow forth from Eden in Genesis (or from Da'ath in the Tree of Life: See the commentary to §7 of the Cry of the 30th lEthyr). T AOTZEM is not recognizable, and may be examined qabalis­tically in several ways. 1 The usual Qabalistic means of blasphem­ing a name is to write it backwards, suggesting that the real name of this creature is METzOAT, perhaps some form of the Hebrew word l71�1'.J, \"center, middle, midst\" (as he is ofTiphereth). 9. And now the Angel comes forward again and closes his mouth. 10. All this time heavy blows have been raining upon me from invisible angels, so that I am weighed down as with a burden greater than the world. I am altogether crushed. Great millstones are hurled out of heaven upon me. I am trying to crawl to the lion, and the ground is covered with sharp bnives. I cut myself at every inch. This metaphorical report will be familiar to many who have pene­trated into realms of such higher-intensity spiritual energies. This sense of being beaten is not uncommon in situations where height­ened kundalini activity is conjoined with efforts to penetrate into progressively subtler realms. It is the relative density of the subtle body that limits one's forward progress, yet the very force of the inner propulsion drives one onward - the net effect being quite a pummeling or crushing. It is the mystical equivalent of being \"caught between a rock and a hard place.\" 1 It could be transliterated in Hebrew either as l:l'::m�D = 220, the number of verses in Liber Legis, The Book of the Law (or of the letters R.C.), or l:l':�n�D = 156 = Babalon; or l:l�l7�D = 210 = N.O.X.

And the voice comes: Why art thou there who art here? Hast thou not the sign of the number, and the seal of the name, and the ring of the eye? Thou wilt not. He is that which he seeks.

The \"ring of the eye\" is the seal of V.V.V.V.V. that Crowley carried, hidden in a secret compartment of his Adeptus Exemptus ring, which he stated was given him by the Secret Masters of A:.A:. to reflect their Au­thority, and which he bore as their agent.

These images are compatible with many ancient songs and sayings about kundalini. 16.

In this rethyr attributed to Geburah, the emphasis has moved from Strength to Justice. Pachad, Geburah, and Diyn-Fear, Strength, and Justice - are the three titles of the fifth sephirah. The vision has climaxed in a glimpse of the highest aspect of that particular principle that it has manifested. This image also may foreshadow the lEon of Maat, which Li­ber Legis implies eventually will succeed that of Horus. Maat is not only goddess of justice, but of actual natural laws governing the fabric of reality. (In modem times, then, we might call Her goddess of physics.)

In my experience, this is the time each month during which magi­cal energies are at their strongest. Even as the Moon reflects the greatest amount of solar light at Full Moon, so does the inner sen­sorium, which is the Moon (or Y esod) aspect within each of us, re­flect the greatest amount of L.V.X. from Tiphereth. Not only are sexual energies at their peak at the time, but their inner counter­parts, those aspects of consciousness employed in the syzygy of the Adept and his or her Holy Guardian Angel, are at their strong­est tides as well. This energy does not peak exactly at the Full Moon, but extends a few days beyond, even as high tides of the oceans crest a few days after New Moon and Full Moon. Exactly how many days after depends on the geographic latitude (as with the ocean's tides). Experiments undertaken (and magical diaries examined) at the same approximate latitude as the North African region of these a:theric visions (viz., in Southern California) sug­gests that this surge of L.V.X. exhausts itself on approximately the third day following the actual Full Moon.

However, it is difficult to sort this astrological prominence from NIA' s correspondence to Chesed in Y etzirah and the correspondence of the I in NIA to Sagittarius. In practice, all these factors reinforced each other. Mars had recently risen, and was less than 4 o above the horizon in actual altitude. Saturn was approximately the same distance (about 6°) below the Ascendant. The vision both began and ended with martial themes and has no significant Saturn characteristics: these facts suggest that the Moon's placement in Sidereal Aries was an active player in the ambient psychic tone, and tipped the scales in favor of the Mars quality. On the other hand, much of the vision deals with honey-like symbols of love, which better fit the Venus-ruled Tropical Taurus Moon; so, in this instance, the Moon sign-symbolism is a wash. NIA or J-\"\"\"L( =Scorpio, Sagittarius, Taurus. It enumerates to 50 + 10 + 1 = 61.The greatest import of 61 is in the word r�, ayin, \"nothing, not.\" By rearranging these letters, one gets 'J�, ani, \"myself.\" The doctrine inferred is that of the Buddhist anatta, that what we call \"myself' is ultimately nothing at all - it does not exist. We also get the word T��' elik, \"to thee,\" which redirects attention from \"myself' to another - implicitly the Holy Guardian Angel. There are other words of similar significance. These words touch on themes found throughout the vision, though only in a somewhat general way. Turning to the symbols of the individual Enochian letters in NIA, the central I, corresponding to Sagittarius, is most obvious in the vision. The angel that appears is a Samekh figure, such as one might find in various versions of Atu XIV, called Temperance or Art. There are also multiple Jupiter themes (Jupiter rules Sagittari­us); and the vision rapidly progressed into a fine example (so far as such can be expressed in images and sounds) of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The Scorpio (N) and Taurus (A) symbols are present more thematically than literally: one might refer to parts of this vision as \"serpentine expressions of inner teaching,\" for example. There are 1 Jupiter was 0°19' from the horizon when measured bodily."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"158 Visions & Voices also Scorpio-themed images in the early paragraphs; and the vari­ous large beasts express the Taurus idea (though not very well). As mentioned previously, this a:thyr corresponds to Chesed in Y etzirah. It is one of the finer examples of such sephirothic sym­bolism. The whole vision has a Chesed tone to it. There are also numerous precise Chesed symbols, especially colors and represen­tations of the Chashmalim, or Angels of Jupiter, who perfectly embody Chesed in Y etzirah. All of these will be indicated as we discuss successive paragraphs of the vision. 1. An angel comes forward into the stone libe a warrior clad in chain-armour. Upon his head are plumes of gray, spread out libe the fan of a peacocb. About his feet a great army of scorpions and dogs, lions, elephants, and many other wild beasts. He stretches forth his arms to heaven and cries, In the cracbling of the lightning, in the rolling of the thunder, in the clashing of the swords and the hurling of the arrows: be thy name exalted! The warrior symbolism corresponds to the just-risen Mars. In the Sidereal Zodiac, it is also indicated with remarkable fidelity, by the Scorpio Sun and Aries Moon. This angel corresponds to Sagit­tarius, and thus to the I in NIA. The peacock is the bird of Juno, feminine aspect of Jupiter. The gray plume symbolizes Chokmah, or Wisdom, which (in one model) corresponds to the Ajna (or \"third eye\") chakra. The scorpions &c. represent the N in NIA. The military tone of the beginning, like the martial experiences at the vision's end (§26), are likely due to the ambient astral condi­tions reflected in the horoscope (see above); but as the angel stretches forth his arms in the Sign of Typhon-Apophis, the imag­es drawn down are as much the lightning and heavenly fire of Ju­piter, and the arrows of Sagittarius, as they are emblems ofMars. 2.

The hummingbirds may represent sweetness and high rates of vibration. The shower of honey-colored dew is a known, recognizable phenomenon, often encountered by mystics (and visible in many Tarot representations as falling Y ods) con­sistent with all of the foregoing. 3. And a voice proceeds from the rose: Come away! Our chariot is drawn by doves. Of mother-of-pearl and ivory is our chariot, and the reins thereof are the heart-strings of men. Every moment that we fly shall cover an <Eon. And every place on which we rest shall be a young universe rejoicing in its strength; the meadows thereof shall be covered with flowers. There shall we rest but a night, and in the morning we shall flee away, comforted. The letter 0, Samekh, was already implied in §2. The chariot im­plies the letter n, Cheth, corresponding to Atu VII, The Chariot; and doves are the birds of Venus, corresponding to 1, Daleth. These three letters spell10n, Chesed. The call to \"Come away!\" actually sounds from the rose, sym­bol of the union of the Adept with his Holy Guardian Angel. This paragraph may be compared to various passages in Liber LXV, es­pecially the beautiful verses 17-26 in Chapter 2. 17 Also the Holy One came upon me, and I beheld a white swan floating in the blue. 18Between its wings I sate, and the reons fled away. 19Then the swan flew and dived and soared, yet no whither we went. 20 A little crazy boy that rode with me spake unto the swan, and said: 21Who art thou that dost float and fly and dive and soar in the inane? Behold, these many reons have passed; whence earnest thou? Whither wilt thou go? 22And laughing I chid him, saying: No whence! No whither! 23The swan being silent, he an­swered: Then, if with no goal, why this eternal journey? 24And I laid my head against the Head of the Swan, and laughed, saying: Is there not joy ineffable in this aimless winging? Is there not weariness and impatience for who would attain to some goal? 25 And the swan was ever silent. Ah! but we floated in the infinite Abyss. Joy! Joy! White swan, bear thou ever me up between thy wings! 260 silence! 0 rapture! 0 end of things visible and invisi­ble! This is all mine, who am Not. 4.

Finer than a spider's web were her robes. And they were of the seven colours. The angel is of Tiphereth (golden hair and skin). In him are Fire and Water equilibrated (as in Atu XIV, 0, Sagittarius). The seven colors imply the phenomenon of the rainbow (a further symbol of Samekh), and correspond to the refraction of the One Light into its wide range of possibilities (one reason that the Adept is titled H a­dos Chamelionis, \"the Way of the Chameleon\"). 5. All this I saw; and then the hidden voice went on low and sweet: Come away! The price of the journey is little, though its name be death. Thou shalt die to all that thou fearest and hopest and hatest and lovest and thinl:?est and art. Vea! thou shalt die, even as thou must die. For all that thou hast, thou hast not; all that thou art, thou art not! \"Hidden voice\" implies \"the Voice in the Silence,\" the Voice of the H.G.A. But there is something more subtle here. The Angels of Chesed, that personify Chesed in the World of Y etzirah, are called the Chashmalim, usually translated \"Brilliant Ones.\" But chashmal (\",7.Jll7n), the singular, is also a Rabbinical pun meaning, \"speaking silence.\" The death references, despite their obvious mystical significance, probably refer, again, to J, Scorpio, and Atu XIII, Death. The final sentence is typical of all of those instruc­tions, repeated throughout most of these visions, intended to pre­pare Crowley (then 7°=4°) for his approach toward and eventual passage through the Abyss to the 8°=3° Grade in Binah. 6.

It means, \"Open the mysteries of your creation.\" 8. And the voice answered and said unto me: Hearing is of the spirit alone. Thou art a partaRer of the five-fold mystery. Thou must roll up the ten divine ones liRe a scroll, and fashion there­from a star. Vet must thou blot out the star in the heart of Hadit . When the five elements are attributed to the five senses, hearing is attributed to Spirit, which completes the pentagram by crowning the other four elements. The rest of the paragraph is practical med­itation instruction, within which Hadit represents the deep center of individuality, the Secret Fire in the heart of one's being. 9.

The 7=4 (Chesed) ceremony of the old Order, to which G :. H :. Fra.

It describes the fashion in which the Adept and the Angel join so fully that their \"otherness\" from each other is canceled in their complementation; the supernal silence ensues. 11.

Crowley was riding the high tide of a recent Full Moon. (On the exact day of the Full Moon, No­vember 27, no vision work was undertaken, and this present vision was received the following morning.) In the Sidereal Zodiac, that Full Moon fell across the constellations Taurus and Scorpio. In the Golden Dawn symbolism in which Crowley had been trained, the Kerubic figures attributed to Taurus and Scorpio were the very Bull and Eagle that dominate this present vision. The brilliant Full Moon had dominated the night sky for two days by then, and was surely strong in Crowley's imagination for psychological reasons alone; but its magical effects are also quite evident in both this vision and, especially, the subsequent one later the same day. What is quite extraordinary, though, is that, despite the Taurus-Scorpio symbolism inherent in the name of the prior (24th) rethyr, the Bull-Eagle symbolism did not appear therein, even though the Moon was in Tropical Taurus at the time. No, on­ly after the Moon had left what Crowley himself thought of as Taurus (i.e., Taurus in the Tropical Zodiac) and moved on into Tropical Gemini did the Bull - and especially the Bull in counter­point to the Eagle - appear in his visions. It is as if the Tropical Zodiac did not even exist - as if the Sidereal were the accurate, objective scale of Nature.

An exact Mercury-Mars trine occurred that day. I cannot detect anything in the vision that corresponds to this. What would be ex­pected, in particular, would be something acutely mental or intel­lectual. Perhaps the mild trine had insufficient potency, but, more likely, this mental tendency (from an aspect that had no particular connection to Crowley's own horoscope) was outweighed by the transit of Venus in exact conjunction to Crowley's Mars- a vis­ceral aspect that came exactly to the Ascendant just as the vision reached its climax in the rapturous experience of the Rosy Cross. A Venus-Mars transit is emotional and passionate, not intellectual at all. Both the Venus-Mars transit and the Sun-Moon aspect of the just-past Full Moon are apt expressions of that union of opposites implied in the symbolism of the Rosy Cross. Venus, Uranus, and Neptune were broadly near the horizon as the vision began - as they had been in several of these. I do not discern any particular significance of this, separate from the gen­eral themes and patterns of all the visions taken in the aggregate. TOR or ) � = Dragon's Head, Libra, Pisces. It enumerates to 9 + 70 + 200 = 279. This number contributes nothing significant to our understanding this vision. The symbolism of Dragon's Head, Libra, Pisces is not wholly clear to me in this vision. The symbolism becomes clearer if one observes that the Tarot correspondences to Caput, Libra, and Pi­sces are The Priestess (l), Adjustment (\";1), and The Moon (p); but, still, this is not the way Caput has tended to manifest in other vi­sions. My own scrying of this .ethyr produced very different results, sinking deeply into mysteries of woman and the pulsing tantric power of the unconscious to reshape us physically, emotionally, and spiritually. To understand the pathway to this alternate vision, lay out the three Tarot trumps just named and meditate on them for a time, recalling that this <ethyr corresponds to an aspect ofBinah. But this is not at all what Crowley received. Behind all the symbolism of his vision, an important kernel of instruction per­sists. I believe that the prior night's Full Moon in Sidereal Taurus and Scorpio (which was a total lunar eclipse, though not visible as such in Algeria) so overwhelmed astral conditions that it would have provided the essential form of nearly any astral exploration. 1. ., the brighb leSS .net. revolve ceas 'II CIM!ring the whole fll twelve rays; CJI1IIIll ....,mgupthe� 'lllllill and he aie5: ....., in the toils of ----L• lpools • '---=wr• m .. bbb. in the roo(� -the bac:bs of .._hams..

Behind all the I of instruction per­in Sidereal Taurus The Cry of the 23rd lEthyr TOR 169 An important key to the mystery of this vision is that the 23rd JEthyr corresponds to Binah in Yetzirah. Binah is the end toward which this entire series of visions eventually carried Aleister Crowley; but this objective was not Binah on this present (psycho­logical) plane, but Binah in the deific world of Atziluth. In the 23rd JEthyr we encounter that sephirah on a much lower arc of the as­cending spiral. For example, it is still defined in terms of duality (B ull vs. Eagle, male vs. female, height vs. depth), though intima­tions already appear that these polarities each represent two ex­pressions of a single thing. Other Binah symbols are evident, par­ticularly the supernal implications of the opening paragraph, and the Kerubim (which are the angelic wardens ofBinah in Briah: see Col. 903 in my book 776�). In brief, then, I think this vision is best looked upon as a cross­ing of the threshold to the Supernals, but wholly on the Yetziratic plane, the plane of personality in general and intellect in particular. Its chief symbolism is the polarity between the Bull, or lingam, of Taurus, and the Eagle, or yoni, of Scorpio. At its climax they are united in the rapturous image of the Rosy Cross. All of the rest is more or less filler, however interesting. 1. In the brightness of the stone are three lights, brighter than all, which revolve ceaselessly. And now there is a spider's web of silver covering the whole of the stone. Behind the spider's web is a star of twelve rays; and behind that again, a blac� bull, furiously pawing up the ground. The flames from his mouth increase and whirl, and he cries: Behold the mystery of toil, 0 thou who art ta�en in the toils of mystery. For I who trample the earth thereby ma�e whirlpools in the air; be comforted, therefore, for though I be blac�, in the roof of my mouth is the sign of the Beetle. Bent are the bac�s of my brethren, yet shall they gore the lion with their horns. Have I not the wings of the eagle, and the face of the man? 2. And now he is turned into one of those winged Assyrian bull-men. Perhaps due to the words \"revolve ceaselessly,\" Crowley inter­preted these lights as the three gunas; with this I have no dispute. At the same time, they appear also to be representations of the three supernal sephiroth (which are associated, though by no"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"170 Visions & Voices means identical, ideas). Three is the number ofBinah; and this vi­sion, corresponding to Binah in Y etzirah, seems keyed to that tri­ad, its polarities, and their resolution. The web-like silver covering is reminiscent of the veil on Atu II, The Priestess, in the Thoth deck, and may correspond to Gimel and Binah (two expressions of the one maternal idea conveyed by the number 3). The \"star of twelve rays\" is an excellent symbol for the twelve-fold zodiacal expression of stellar energies that charac­terize Chokmah. If this interpretation is valid, it suggests the black bull, next appearing, as some sort of Kether idea to complete the trinity; and, in a Y etziratic or elemental fashion, he is this in fact, because Kether is Air, or 1 (Taurus), within the Supernals. Despite the hull's black color, Crowley identified him (due to the symbol­ism of the beetle in his mouth) with Apis, the bull-deity represent­ing renewal of life, adding that, \"The Beetle is the Midnight Sun, the hidden hope of Earth.\" Apis was regarded as an incarnation of Osiris: their conjoined expression as Asar-Apis became the Greek Serapis. Budge quotes Egyptian passages describing this bull vari­ously as \"lord of heaven ... lord of life forever ... the second Ptah.\" More pointedly, this bull is an expression of the traditional im­age of the Kerubim; and though he rejects the symbol of the Lion from his imagery, he specifically incorporates parts of the Bull, Eagle, and Man. He is black, the color both of Binah and of ele­mental Earth, and is positioned in the North, the direction attribut­ed to Earth, and \"the place of greatest darkness\"-so perhaps his rejection of the Lion is a rejection of the symbol of the south and light, in favor of symbols of night. He bears the token of the mid­night Sun in the roof of his mouth, and \"the sun of midnight is ev­er the son,\" Vav, 1, Taurus. And, as mentioned before, the Kerubim of which he is em­blematic are the traditional guardians of Binah in Briah, even as the Sphinx was the warden of Thebes in Oedipus' ordeal of pass­ing the great chasm to enter the city where he would be received back into the arms of his mother. The earth on which he tramples symbolizes physical sensations that are stirred by his presence. These, in tum, make \"whirlpools in the air,\" i.e., in the inner sensorium. \"Whirlpool\" is the literal meaning of the Sanskrit vritti, often translated \"modifications,\" and applied to stirrings, whirlings, and forms within the funda­mental \"mind-stuff,\" or chitta: thoughts and emotions. 3.

All are phallic representations. By the way, the Egyptian (Demot­ic) word for \"bull,\" which was their name for the constellation Taurus, also means \"phallus.\" \"All the heavens beneath me\" con­firms the elevated nature of this bull by referring to all aspects of consciousness below his supernal station. 4. Glory be unto thee, who didst set thy feet in the North; whose forehead is pierced with the sharp points of the diamonds in thy crown; whose heart is pierced with the spear of thine own fecun­dity. Some part of the consciousness of the \"crown\" (Kether) pierces his head, i.e., interpenetrates his intellect. This \"north\" is probably that of the Microcosm and of the 0=0 ritual, corresponding to ele­mental Earth. It represents a voluntary entering of \"the path of darkness\" that one might, eventually, be brought into light. And, while the \"points\" of Kether have penetrated downward, the last sentence of the paragraph indicates that his Y esod, corresponding to the genitals and the creative power thereof, has penetrated up­ward into his Tiphereth: The fullness of Adepthood is found not alone in the heights or the depths, but in their common, commin­gling fusion in the center where they converge. 5. Thou art an egg of blacRness, and a worm of poison. But thou hast formulated thy father, and made fertile thy mother. The \"egg of blackness\" is the symbol of Akasha, Spirit, the Quin­tessence. \"Worm\" is used throughout the Thelemic Holy Books in a generally disparaging fashion, though this passage also might be compared to Liber LXV, 3:39 or 4:24, &c., for a different idea: Thou hast fastened the fangs of Eternity in my soul, and the Poi­son of the Infinite hath consumed me utterly.

Also, though I be planted so firmly upon the earth, yet is my blood wine and my breath fire of madness. With these wings, though they be but little, I lift myself above the crown of the yod, and being without fins I yet swim in the inviolate fountain. \"Kether is in Malkuth.\" The heights find fulfilled expression in the depths; and between the extremes of height and depth circulate both the heart-pumped blood that is like wine, and the breath that is like \"the fire of madness.\" 8. I disport myself in the ruins of Eden, even as Leviathan in the false sea, being whole as the rose at the crown of the cross. Come ye unto me, my children, and be glad.

The purpose of this seems to be to contrast the depths to the heights, as aspects of the same experience. The Height is not sul­lied by its play and participation in the depths. The Stability­Change contrast of the last sentence is an expression ofthe 2°=9° formula ofYesod or, more likely, the 9°=2° formula ofChokmah: it is anikka. 9.

This is a dramatic device, to transition from Act I to Act II; from the Bull to the Eagle; from the masculine idea which descends form the heights into the depths, to the feminine idea which as­cends from the depths into the heights. Silver and purple corre­spond to Y esod and the Moon, and gold to Tiphereth and the Sun. 11. And he cries: All my strength and stability are turned to the use of flight. For though my wings are of fine gold, yet my heart is the heart of a scorpion. Do these golden wings refer to the sun's presence in Scorpio? The phrase \"the heart of a scorpion\" is an unmistakable reference to the star Antares, also called Cor Scorpii, the brightest star in the constellation though not visible in the late November sky. (The Sun was about 3 o from Antares when this vision was received.) Antares is only two minutes of arc from being exactly opposite the brightest star in Taurus, Aldebaran, called \"the eye of the bull,\" so this scorpion's heart is exactly aligned with the \"eye\" (that is, in Crowley's language, the phallus) of the bull. 12. Clory unto thee, who being born in a stable didst maRe thee mirth of the filth thereof, who didst sud� in iniquity from the breast of thy mother the harlot; who didst flood with iniquity the bodies of thy concubines. The references appear Christian, derogatory, and anti-sexual, though \"mirth of the filth\" clues us to a look to A'ayin, l7, Capri­corn, Atu XV, The Devil, as if Christ and the Devil are being ad­dressed as a common symbol. Yet there is a deeper meaning here: It is part of Crowley's further preparation for the actual crossing of 1 These are intended to show symbolically that the Bull is the same as the Ea­gle. -AC"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"17 4 Visions & Voices the Abyss and the eventual entering into Binah on a higher arc. This expressed shadow aspect of Christianity was its shadow in Crowley's own soul, not yet cleaned and expunged. In particular, this paragraph shows one phase of his overthrowing of ideas of shame in sex. 13. Thou didst lie in the filth of the streets with the dogs; thou wast tumbled and shameless and wanton in a place where four roads meet. There wast thou defiled, and there wast thou slain, and there wast thou left to rot. The charred stal:?e was thrust through thy bowels, and thy parts were cut off and thrust into thy mouth for derision. The reference to the cross (or crossroads) is complex. Among oth­er simultaneous possible meanings, its relationship to the Portal Ritual of the Golden Dawn should not be missed, especially in terms of the equilibration of the four elements. Portal symbolism is reiterated by \"defiled\" and \"slain,\" which seem to refer to l7 and J, The Devil (Atu XV) and Death (Atu XIII), two paths prominent in the Portal ceremony. 14. All my unity is dissolved; I live in the tips of my feathers. That which I thin!:? to be myself is but infinite number. Glory unto the Rose and the Cross, for the Cross is extended unto the uttermost end beyond space and time and being and l:?nowledge and de­light! Glory unto the Rose that is the minute point of its centre! Even as we say; glory unto the Rose that is Nuit the circumfer­ence of all, and glory unto the Cross that is the heart of the Rose! The vision approaches its climax. The Bull, as the masculine pole, was concentrated (as Hadit, or the Cross folded in upon itself); now the Eagle, as the feminine pole, is unfolded, or extended, to its fullest (as Nuit, or the rose unfolded in its opening). Yet, para­doxically, the Cross is then atypically described in its extension, and the Rose in its concentration. Both extremes are true concur­rently: their paradoxical coexistence is characteristic of such mys­tic states. 15.

The numbers attributed to the geometric figures, which seem double what one would expect, represent both the points and the hollows, both the masculine and the feminine parts of each. Thus, there are eight \"quarters\" rather than four, and ten points to the pentagram instead of five (to include the indented or feminine points, as well as the masculine or extended ones). The \"seal of Solomon\" is the hexagram, and the \"hammer of Thor\" is the swastika, drawn, in one of the G.D. ceremonies, as comprising 17 squares, and here doubled to 34. The Rosy Cross is the climax of the union of opposites, the chorus of the concurrent scream and bellow, symbolized by the Sun and Moon in the prior day's Full Moon, and by the conjunc­tion of Venus with Crowley's Mars that was crossing the eastern horizon just as this part of the vision was experienced. \"Falutli\" had first appeared two years earlier, during the writ­ing of Liber VII 5:30: \"Ah God, all is gone! Thou dost consum­mate Thy rapture. Falutli! Falutli!\" Exactly the same idea is ex­pressed here. The word can be analyzed in several different ways. (Crowley examined it syllable by syllable, letter by letter, in his own notes on The Vision & the Voice, which the interested student should consult.) In IN THE CONTINUUM Vol. I, No.7, Soror Meral suggested that F alutli be spelled 'Z,olJZ,�, = 156, the value of the name Babalon and of the similarly ecstatic, rapturous word' PtAtF, Hriliu.

Crowley's personal and magical energies were, by all appearances, running very high, likely the consequence of the Full Moon and of Venus' transiting conjunction with his Mars. The Moon remained in Sidereal Taurus at the start, though it slipped into Gemini about a fourth of the way through, at 4:32 p.m. In the Tropical Zodiac, it was in Gemini throughout. Perhaps most significant in the lunar placement is that it precisely squared Crowley's own Moon, adding to the charge of emotional energy and to his sensitivity. The partile Mercury-Mars trine in space seems to add no more here than previously. What is symbolically different is the selection of planets near the horizon. Mercury and the Sun are just above the Descendant, dominating the foreground of the horoscope. Both would set about 4:30p.m., an event actually described in §21 (\"I have passed into the Kingdom of the West after my Father.\"). Mercurial themes substantially involved the presence of a table of letters - a charac­teristic mercurial device - dominating much of the vision. Mercu­ry appears also as the \"child.\" But what is unmistakable is the so­lar symbolism: This vision contains a very high and pure exposi­tion of the deeper meaning of the traditional 5=6 ceremony through which Crowley had been admitted into the Tiphereth grade of the R.R. et A.C.

The Sidereal Taurus placement, with which the Moon commenced the vision, does not seem important. \"Twin\" symbolism implicitly occurs later in the vision, at a time when the Moon was in Gemini in both zodiacs. Symbols corresponding to the Sun's placement in Tropical Sagittarius and Sidereal Scorpio could be wholly derived from the Sagittarius and Scorpio letters in the name LIN. LIN or C1::J = Cancer, Sagittarius, Scorpio. It enumerates to 30 + 10 + 50 = 90. This is a remarkable correspondence, for 90 is the value of the letter�. Tzaddi, corresponding in Tarot to The Emperor. The esoteric title of this card is, \"The Sun of the Morn­ing: Chief Among the Mighty\"-compare that to §21! Spiritually, the vision is one of emerging kingship, a fact reinforced by the Hebrew word for \"king,\" melekh, l�l'.J = 90. This is also an extraordinary vision of fermentation and trans­formation. The individual letters of \"LIN\" (which are otherwise explained briefly in § 14) each represent potent symbols of trans­formation. Cancer, Cheth, n, is the path on the Tree of Life that opens to Binah; it symbolizes the transcendent Formula of the Ho­ly Grail. Sagittarius, Samekh, 0, is the path that opens to Tipher­eth; it signifies the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Scorpio, Nun, J, partakes of both of these, since, like Sagittarius, it admits to Tiphereth; and its numerical value, 50, links it to the \"50 Gates of Binah\" that are symbolic portals to that sephirah in the Merkabah, or \"chariot,\" schools of Qabalah. And of course, Scorpio's symbolism incorporates nearly every main \"symbol of transformation\" known to students of this subject. According to the theory that has served us throughout our ex­amination of these rethyrs, LIN is attributed to Chokmah in Yetzirah. In reading through the vision's text, Chokmah symbols are few. There is, however, no doubt that a correspondence to the Supemals applies, the vision seeming, perhaps, more of the nature of Kether than of Chokmah, much as occurred in the Binah­attributed 23rd iEthyr preceding. What is most clear, though, is that the Vision and Voice of the 22nd iEthyr, LIN, are a quintessentialized replaying of the Adeptus Minor ritual, disclosing what is inwardly meant by many of its outer forms.

It is surrounded by an innumerable company of an­gels; these angels are of all �inds, - some brilliant and flashing as gods, down to elemental creatures. The light comes and goes on the tablet; and now it is steady, and I perceive that each letter of the tablet is composed of forty-nine other letters, in a language which loo�s li�e that of Honorius; but when I would read, the let­ter that I loo� at becomes indistinct at once. Below is \"the mysteries table of forty-nine squares.\" It originated in the scrying work of John Dee and his assistant, Edward Kelley. The technical methods of its use are explained in A:.A:.

Just as is described in our present text, numerous kinds of an­gelic names are derived from it. Many of these names were made part of the Sigillum Dei /Emeth, which held a prominent place in Dee's work. Perhaps most important of these are the names of seven planetary angels, which (based on Hebrew names of the planets to which they correspond) are derived as follows: Begin­ning with the S in the upper left comer, proceed along diagonals to add the letters AB, then ATH, then I-, with the ,m 8\" signifying, by convention, the letters -AL, or -�N. The result is the name SA­BATHIEL, an angel of Saturn (Shabbathai). Continuing, we derive"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"180 Visions & Voices the other six names: ZEDEKIEL (Jupiter), MADIMIEL (Mars), SEMELIEL (Sol), NOGAHEL (Venus), CORABIEL (Mercury), and LEVANLEL (Luna). This seven-by-seven \"table\" is part of a larger scheme of Enochian symbols arising from the number 7, perhaps the highest of which is the seven-lettered name BABALON. 2. And now there comes an Angel, to hide the tablet with his mighty wing. This Angel has all the colours mingled in his dress; his head is proud and beautiful; his headdress is of silver and red and blue and gold and blacl�, libe cascades of water, and in his left hand he has a pan-pipe of the seven holy metals, upon which he plays. I cannot tell you how wonderful the music is, but it is so wonderful that one only lives in one's ears; one cannot see any­thing any more. The mingling of \"all the colours\" is a Chokmah symbol: the tradi­tional gray of Chokmah in the Queen Scale is only apparent, be­ing, instead, a mixture of all the spectrum colors and their com­plements implied by gray. Yet the rainbow nature of \"all the col­ours\" is also compatible with the symbolism of Samekh, 0. The five headdress colors may be the white, red, blue, yellow, and black of the five elements, 1 here represented, instead, in the colors of precious metals and jewels. 3. Now he stops playing and moves with his finger in the air. His finger leaves a trail of fire of every colour, so that the whole Aire is become libe a web of mingled lights. But through it all drops dew. No matter which of the senses is stimulated or employed, it is merely an attempt to express the inexpressibly beautiful within a more familiar sensory framework. What was being communicated is, in fact, neither sound nor tracings of fiery light, but rather something transcendent to the physical senses. 4. (I can't describe these things at all. Dew doesn't represent what I mean in the least. For instance, these drops of dew are enor­mous globes, shining libe the full moon, only perfectly transpar­ent, as well as perfectly luminous.) 1 These colors were used as such on the wand borne by the Chief Adept of the R.R. et A.C. in Crowley's time."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"�), MADIMIEL (Mars), �IEL (Mercury), and rt.ble\" is part of a larger Ill the number 7, perhaps llime BABALON. � the. tablet with his is mingled in his dress; his �. is of silver and red and 'fJf water, and in his left metals, upon which he the music is, but it is so · one cannot see any-t symbol: the tradi­only apparent, be­ors and their com­� nature of \"all the col­p-m of Samekh, 0.

This \"dew\" has appeared in earlier reth­yrs, and will appear, as well, in subsequent ones. It is a very dis­tinctive phenomenon, documented repeatedly by mystics and spir­itual aspirants in numerous paths. In Tarot, it is implied by the fall­ing of Hebrew Yods (') from the sky. It may be hidden in the He­brew legend of manna (l7.J = 90 = LIN) falling from heaven to feed sojourners in the wilderness. By all appearances it is a wholly ob­jective phenomenon, at least quasi-physical, yet indiscernible until a certain state of inner perception has awakened. It often accom­panies intense kundalini experiences, but either can occur in the absence of the other. It is most commonly described as dew, or as rain falling from the sky, though that rain also is commonly called fire falling from heaven. Its pearlescent sphericity is a common observation. From medieval alchemists to 20th Century songwriter John Denver, it has been portrayed in comparable terms. The Ritual of the 28th Path in the Golden Dawn 4=7 ceremony described it in three different states or conditions, as follows: First, an officer identified with the Egyptian goddess Isis said, \"I am the rain of Heaven, descending upon the Earth, bearing with it the fructifying and germinating Power. I am the plenteous yield­er of Harvest; I am the Cherisher of Life.\" Second, an officer identified with Isis' sister, Nephthys, said, \"I am the Dew descending noiseless and silent, gemming the Earth with countless Diamonds of Dew; bearing down the influences from above in the solemn Darkness of Night.\" Third, an officer identified with the goddess Hathor said, \"I am the Ruler of Mist and Cloud; wrapping the Earth ... with a garment floating and hovering between Earth and Heaven. I am the Giver of the Mist Veil of Autumn, the successor of the Dew-clad Night.\" Anastratus called it, \"the distilled moisture of the Moon, joined to the light of the Sun and congealed.\" An alchemical tract quoted in The Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians calls it, \"the dew of heaven,\" the l:l'7.JtZ7il ?u of Genesis 27:38 that \"falls from above in­to the depths of the earth, and the subtlest portion of the earth is its body ... The best dew is that which is coagulated like an electrum, or like transparent amber of a mixed color.\" Compare this to Crowley's occasional description of it as \"honey.\""},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"182 Visions & Voices 5.

My arms were out in the form of a cross, and that Cross was extended, blazing with light into infinity. I myself am the minut­est point in it. This is the birth of form. 12. I am encircled by an immense sphere of many-coloured bands; it seems it is the sphere of the Sephiroth projected in the three dimensions. This is the birth of death. 13. Now in the centre within me is a glowing sun. That is the birth of hell The \"crucifixion\" from the Adeptus Minor initiation, wherein the postulant is strapped to a large cross to take the obligation, is here given its deeper meaning. §§ 11-13 refer, respectively, to Hadit, Nuit, and Heru-Ra-Ha (the latter being also an ensign of the union of the Cross and Rose). \"Hell\" simply means \"the hidden place,\"1 that sanctuary, adytum, or Holy of Holies within each of us. 14. Now all that is swept away, washed away by the table. It is the virtue of the table to sweep everything away. It is the letter I in this JEthyr that gives this vision, and L is its purity, and N is its energy. Now everything is confused, for I invol:?ed the Mind, that is disruption. Every Adept who beholds this vision is corrupted by mind. Yet it is by virtue of mind that he endures it, and passes on, if so be that he pass on. Yet there is nothing higher than this, for it is perfectly balanced in itself. I cannot read a word of the holy Table, for the letters of the Table are all wrong. They are only the shadows of shadows. And whoso beholdeth this Table with this rapture, is light. The true word for light hath seven letters. They are the same as ARARITA, transmuted. 1 From the same Indo-European root, meaning \"to cover or conceal\" as hall, helmet, hull, hole, hollow, holster, color, conceal, and occult, for example."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"184 Visions & Voices In the name LIN, the I (Sagittarius) is the main theme of the vi­sion, i.e., it is primarily of the Holy Guardian Angel; L (Cancer) gives purity, through its ruler, the Moon. N (Scorpio) gives energy through Mars. Why is it that every Adept who beholds this vision is corrupted by mind? What is intrinsic to this cethyr and its nature that causes this? Is it because the vision corresponds to the sphere of Wisdom, but in the plane of personality? It is easy to understand that intel­lect is the enemy of samadhi, and that after a samadhi experience there is a natural tendency for the intellect and ego to reassert themselves in retaliation for their displacement; but the inherent relationship of this to the cethyr is not otherwise readily evident. 15. There is a voice in this JEthyr, but it cannot be spol:?en. The on­ly way one can represent it is as a ceaseless thundering of the word Amen. It is not a repetition of Amen, because there is no time. It is one Amen continuous. This is the Hindu idea of AUM, vibrating eternally, as the inherent sound of the universe. 16. Shall mine eye fade before thy glory? I am the eye. That is why the eye is seventy. You can never understand why, except in this vision. Crowley gives a hint of this mystery in his note: \"The general idea is perhaps this: 70 = i10i1, Hush! And �'�, Night, and 110, The Se­cret. The glory is so great that it cannot be manifested by any posi­tive means.\" Additionally, his \"I am the eye\" defines him as a point of view, or Hadit; it is his individuality that shall \"fade be­fore thy glory.\" 17.

The description in this verse is quite interesting if the child is regarded as an expres­sion of the child-god Mercury; for not long before, Mercury and the Sun (\"my father\") actually had set in the west.

The 21st .tEthyr corre­sponds to Kether in the World of Y etzirah. Most symbols in this vision correspond either to Kether or to the Moon's placement in Sidereal Gemini. Crowley concluded that in the 215\\ 20th, and 191h .tEthyrs he was introduced, respectively, to the Hierophant, Hiere­us, and Hegemon of his initiation to the 8°=3° Grade of Magister Templi. In those terms, this vision provides the Hierophant. But before getting too deeply into the astrological analysis of what does work in the accompanying horoscope, we should first notice what does not. It cannot be missed that Mars was precisely rising at the time this vision commenced; yet the vision is not mar­tial. Certainly there were arduous moments, but no more than many of these visions required of the seer; and martial symbols do not dominate the vision. Where they can be squeezed out (a sharp blade here, a forceful push there) it is just so much a posteriori justification. The simple fact is that, based on decades of astrolog­ical experience and on patterns witnessed in these visions, we would expect clear Mars symbols at least upon Crowley's stepping into the periphery of this vision - perhaps a good melee, or a river of blood, or at least a bright patch of red. Even a wolf running"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"190 Visions & Voices past, or a tiny pentagram, or a pair of ruby slippers would have done the job. Something! But it isn't there. And the rising Mars is part of an important astrological pattern: It completes a T -square by its opposition to Jupiter and their shared square to the Moon. (The Moon is less than a third of a de­gree from their midpoint, halfway between them and equally squaring each.) And this strong pattern is on the angles at the commencement of the vision. Moon-Mars-Jupiter together are jocund, celebratory, and indulgent; also willful, ambitious, and ac­complishing. The closest we see to most of this is the ambitious striving for attainment that is common to most of these visions. So much for the angular planets and the strongest aspect pat­tern. In either zodiac, and by any conventional astrological theory, they are a bust! I am left to conclude that the nature of the vision itself, into which Crowley seems to have moved immediately and without preliminary or transition, so overwhelmed the astral ambiance that any such details were lost. The nature of the 21st LEthyr itself is unusually clear and precise. Transits to Crowley's horoscope are far more interesting. As a minor detail, Venus remains within I o of conjunction to his Mars, though separating. Its passionate intensity continues, though it is waning like the Full Moon energies. But, of much greater interest is the fact that, on this day, and as measured in the precession-free Sidereal Zodiac, transiting Uranus moved to within 1 o of the square to Crowley's natal Sun, joining Neptune in that configura­tion. Why do I emphasize that this transit now began only in the Si­dereal Zodiac? It is because the timing of transits is somewhat dif­ferent in the two zodiacal schemes. The Sidereal Zodiac is fixed against the background of space; that is, in mystical terms, its ma­trix is the body ofNuit Herself. But the Tropical Zodiac, linked to the ever-moving equinoctial points, continuously recedes along the ecliptic. In the 34 years that Crowley had lived by the autumn of 1909, the Tropical Zodiac had retrograded 0°28' along the ecliptic -nearly half a degree. Transits to his natal planets in the Tropical framework then appeared to be exact 0°28' earlier than in the Side­real framework. Tropically, both Neptune and Uranus were within a degree of square to his Sun from before he began the work on the 28th LEthyr on November 23.

There is, however, no question as to the significance of this du­al transit of Uranus and Neptune during this stage of Crowley's life. It is epochal in the evolution of a soul in an incarnation. Few would be fortunate enough to experience it in a lifetime; fewer still would regard it as a blessing when it occurred! In simple terms, this is a one-two punch: Neptune softens the ego up for Uranus' il­luminative knockout blow. More specifically, when Neptune transits in major aspect to na­tal Sun, ideas long held about oneself seem less certain and more nebulous. The ego's perimeter is softened. Confusion temporarily reigns regarding identity and goals. The \"dividing line\" between oneself and others is no longer clear. This partial dissolution of the ego-structure eventually permits a larger concept of self to emerge. The mystical implications in Crowley's situation (leading to his eventual crossing of the Abyss one week later) are quite evident. Uranus' transit to the Sun is a new lease on life! Its theme word is Awakening. Self-perspective and life-purpose are clarified, and the vital creative spirit newly enkindled. Freedom (from anything that previously has held one back) is the theme of the time. Com­bined with Neptune's solar transit, we have ... exactly the sort of transformative psychological and mystical processes through which Crowley then was passing. This vision occurred with the Moon in Sidereal Gemini or ' Tropical Cancer. Both Gemini and Cancer letters occur in the name ASP; but it is the Gemini themes which, more than any other feature of this horoscope, dominate the vision. The wind, the dag­ger, the avenue of pairs of pillars, the multiplicity of sensory alphabets and efforts to communicate, the abundant Air themes, and the muttering and verbosity of the deity and his ape are all overt Gemini symbols. There are no clear Cancer themes. Similarly, many of these Gemini themes also correspond to Kether of Yetzirah. There is no difficulty understanding the Kether correspondence. Here is the invisible and ineffable ONE. Numerous Kether symbols will be evident to the student on even a superficial reading. Furthermore, the correspondence of this rethyr is specifically to Kether of Y etzirah, that one of the four Qabalis­tic Worlds attributed to the element Air. The mighty wind and many other Air symbols have the mark of this element taken to its"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"192 Visions & Voices apex. The vision shows the astral winds whipped to their mightiest strength, then pausing, stilling, even as the yammering mind can be made still, to provide the portal that opens unto the World of Briah beyond. ASP or,?�= Taurus, Gemini, Cancer. It enumerates to 1 + 60 + 80 = 141.1 This number is not helpful: It touches none of the important themes of this vision. The individual letters of ASP are of little evident importance, other than the central one, corresponding to Gemini. Ultimately, there is no difficulty perceiving an importance in the letters corre­sponding to the instruction of the Inner Teacher (A= 1, The Hiero­phant) and increasing receptivity to Neshamah (P = n, The Chari­ot); they simply are not as overtly evident in their import as in many of the other visions in this series. It is likely, therefore, that the simple, elegant truth of this vi­sion is found in its correspondence to Kether of Y etzirah, of which \"there is no sense of any kind connected to it.\" Astrological corre­spondences mostly fell away, and the individual significance of the component letters was mostly lost, because the vision itself represents that which, per se, has no characteristics. 1. A mighty wind rolls through all the JEthyr; there is a sense of absolute emptiness; no colour, no form, no substance. Only now and then there seem, as it were, the shadows of great angels, swept along. No sound; there is something very remorseless about the wind, passionless, that is very terrible. In a way, it is nerve­shal:?ing. It seems as if something l:?ept on trying to open behind the wind, and just as it is about to open, the effort is exhausted. The wind is not cold or hot; there is no sense of any !:lind connect­ed with it. One does not even feel it, for one is standing in front of it. This wind corresponds to Kether in the World of Air (Yetzirah). It is the Ruach of the seer, the surging and shifting substance of his thoughts and passions. Air refers, in its higher aspects, to the void; 1 In this instance, the classic (geomancy-based) method of enumerating Enochian would have been much better.

Now, the thing opens behind, just for a second, and I catch a glimpse of an avenue of pillars, and at the end a throne, sup­ported by sphinxes. All this is bloc!:? marble. 3. Now I seem to have gone through the wind, and to be standing before the throne; but he that sitteth thereon is invisible. Yet it is from him that all this desolation proceeds. The winds of Ruach part, like the curtain in the classic Portal cer­emony, to give a brief glimpse of what is beyond. It is the World of Briah, which lies behind Kether of Y etzirah. If we did not al­ready suspect this, we would have been informed by the presence of the throne, one of the basic symbols ofBriah even as it is ofBi­nah. It is of black marble, the color of Binah; compare the refer­ence to Isis in Liber VII 7:4: But of pure black marble is the sorry statue, and the changeless pain of the eyes is bitter to the blind. The avenue of pillars (presumably disposed in pairs) may be a symbol of Gemini, but also of the passage of a threshold. The in­visible ONE upon the throne is beyond even this, i.e., is of Atzi­luth. \"Desolation,\" from the Latin solus, \"alone,\" simply refers again to Kether, the ONE. 4.

All these tastes issue from his eyes; he signals them. 5. I can see his eyes now. They are very round, with perfectly blacl? pupils, perfectly white iris, and the cornea pale blue. The sense of desolation is so acute that I l?eep on trying to get away from the vision. In the supra-physical levels of existence, communication passes directly, and not through the physical senses. However, those liv­ing persons who sojourn these levels most commonly need to em­ploy the physical senses (or, rather, their inner analogues) to or­ganize and interpret impressions, until a more subtle faculty ma­tures. This is, for example, common among those who have briefly died and been resuscitated: It is usual that those who return with memories will recall Beauty, plain and simple; but it will com­monly be interpreted in terms of one of the physical senses, whether as music beautiful beyond description that could not be captured by any instrument; or light and color of similar splendor, but irreducible to a pallet; or simple kinesthetic rapture. Similarly, when, beginning in §4, the god attempts to communicate directly with Crowley, the message registers, in each case, through one of the physical senses, as if trying to rise from his nervous system in­to one of the specialized interpretive sections of his brain. The first attempt is through the sense of taste. Each taste was representative of an idea. Crowley tabulated this \"alphabet of taste\" in his own commentary on these visions, translating the whole message as: The Earth is sick of love; with disease and death is she sick. .. the natural lust, fierce as it is, is not enough; virgins, boys, women [make men] sick, weak of semen and sick. The earth shall be cured of her sickness by true Art-of-Sun, and thine own pleasures, and thou ... , shall abolish the world's woe, and bring on the Age of Righteousness. 6. I told him that I could not understand his taste-language, so instead he set up a humming very much lil?e a big electric plant with dynamos going.

Now the atmosphere is deep night-blue; and by the power of that atmosphere, the pillars bindle to a dull glowing crimson, and the throne is a dull, ruddy gold. And now, through the humming, come very clear, bell-Jibe notes, and farther still a muttering, Jibe that of a gathering storm . The \"deep night-blue\" and crimson are the colors of Binah in Briah (Queen Scale) and Atziluth (King Scale), respectively. The former is also the color of the Akasha-tattwa to which the hum­ming gave access. It allowed passage through the veil of the wind and into the Briatic realm beyond it. The throne is the gold of the Sun, \"as ifRa-Hoor-Khuit were alive in the midst of the Womb of his Mother,\" as Crowley commented. The sounds are the normal progression of the midas, or interior sounds, that commonly ac­company the rise of kundalini. 8. And now I hear the meaning of the muttering: I am he who was before the beginning, and in my desolation I cried aloud, saying, let me behold my countenance in the concave of the abyss. And I beheld, and lo! in the darbness of the abyss my coun­tenance was blacb, and empty, and distorted, that was (once) invisible and pure. 9. Then I closed mine eye, that I might not behold it, and for this was it fixed. Now it is written that one glance of mine eye shall destroy it. And mine eye I dare not open, because of the foulness of the vision. Therefore do I gaze with these two eyes throughout the aaon. Is there not one of all my adepts that shall come unto me, and cut off mine eyelids, that I may behold and destroy? What was incomprehensible slowly becomes comprehensible. The mind adapts to a new level of cognition. The text bespeaks the mystery of the Microcosm and Macrocosm from The Zohar. Note that the Abyss is the mirror in which the 'Face of God' finds re­flection. 'Eye' is singular: It is the Eye of Horus, or of Providence, or of Shiva, or the Eye of the A:. A:. , here depicted as the third eye, or Ajna chakra, of the Most High. It is the gazing with a sin­gle eye that dissolves the manifest: \"Therefore,\" the figure says, \"I gaze with these two eyes throughout the LEon,\" a dualistic view perpetuating creation."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"196 Visions & Voices 10. Now I tal:?e a dagger, and, searching out his third eye, see!:? to cut off the eye-lids, but they are of adamant. And the edge of the dagger is turned. In the spirit of his teacher, Allan Bennett (V.H. Fra. Iehi Aur), Crowley preferred that Shiva open his eye and destroy the uni­verse, so he tried to help this along. It is the effort of the mystic seeking his own dissolution; that is, it is one big projec­tion! But such projections are useful and constitute most magical symbols and mystical metaphors that we employ. Yet his dagger - his intellect, and the charac­teristic implement of Air - is incapable of accomplishing the job. The intellect simply cannot penetrate the adamantine vault of the Infinite, and is \"turned back.\" 11. And tears drop from his eyes, and there is a mournful voice: So it hath been ever: so must it ever be! Though thou hast the strength of five bulls, thou shalt not avail in this. Five bulls: five occurrences of the letter 1, Vav, corresponding to Taurus: the motto V.V.V.V.V. In one sense, this was Crowley's Magister Templi motto, not yet fully claimed. In another sense, he had, for many years, regarded it as the name of that Supernal ONE (not himself) who had founded the A:.A:., and had written most of its channeled sacred texts. 12. And I said to him: Who shall avail? And he answered me: I !:?now not. But the dagger of penance thou shalt temper seven times, afflicting the seven courses of thy soul. And thou shalt sharpen its edge seven times by the seven ordeals. \"Dagger of penance\" has many implications, especially in the Christian mysticism with which Crowley was familiar; but the specific, technical use of this term is in reference to the dagger that sealed the obligation of the Zelator Adeptus Minor, 5=6 of the R.R. et A.

And the muttering continues: Nor speabeth He nor thinbeth, so that which I say is true, because I lie in speabing His thoughts. The essence of the Most High - of Kether, �1i1, i1'i1� - is still­ness. This Gemini-like verbosity is the \"ape\" of the god (referring to the ape frequently depicted as companion to Thoth, or \"thought\"). This is the intellect of the mystic, the \"monkey on the back\" of all who struggle with their addiction to things mental. Di­rect, infusing spiritual instruction from the Most High comes in si­lence, without words, and then is rendered into what passes for comprehensibility by the mystic's intellect. Because TRUTH (nTJ�) cannot be encompassed by the binary, either-or patterns of intel­lect, whatsoever of this TRUTH gains voice is necessarily a lie; that is, it is a gross misrepresentation of what is true.

I find that I was wrong in suggesting that a Master of the Temple had a right to enter the temple of a Magus or an lpsissi­mus. On the contrary, the rule that holds below, holds also above. The higher you go, the greater is the distance from one grade to another. Crowley explained the last sentence of §23 in Magick in Theory & Practice, Cap. VII, Sect. 4. The traditional grades are expressed by two numbers from 1 °= 10° at the beginning, through 5°=6° in the middle, to 1 0°= 1 ° at the end. It has been observed in practice that the closer the two numbers are to each other (or, the closer their ratio is to 1 ), the faster moves the grade on average. \"Initiation, therefore, is progressively easier, in a certain sense,\" Crowley wrote, \"after the first step is taken. But (especially after the pass­ing of Tiphereth) the distance between grade and grade increases as it were by a geometrical progression ... \" 24.

Jupiter? It doesn't look so at first. But Jupiter is barely over a degree from the upper square to the Ascendant and, while the Midheaven is often casually called Zenith - meaning the highest point - it is only the southernmost point of the ecliptic (in the Northern Hemisphere). The highest part, the actual longitude of the Zenith, is the upper square to the Ascendant, about a degree from where Jupiter is located. 1 Another subtlety: Jupiter is in the exact degree of the star Vindemiatrix in the constellation Virgo. The name means \"grape­gatherer.\" The Romans also called it Ampelos, the favorite of the wine-god Bacchus. Among Romans, Greeks, and even Egyptians, the star was depicted as a radiant youth, or \"boy beautiful.\" What has this to do with the present vision? Read § 15 and see. It ex­plains an otherwise inexplicable inclusion of the Tiphereth-like Bacchus-Adonis archetype in a vision predominantly jovian. 1 For confirmation: Altitude is the measurement of distance above the horizon. The point of the ecliptic marking the Midheaven at the start of this vision had an altitude of 42°51'. However, Jupiter was 4 7°45' above the horizon. In astrologi­cal argot, Jupiter was the most elevated planet."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"204 Visions & Voices The Moon's many aspects do little more than enhance the mys­tic sensitivity of the time. Neither the Sidereal Gemini nor Tropi­cal Cancer sign placement of Luna seems to have a particular bearing on the vision. Venus is now square (within 1 °) Crowley's natal Venus, but barely so; we shall see this gain greater im­portance as it gets closer to exact aspect during the Vision of the 19th .tEthyr. No, this vision of the 20th .tEthyr is of Jupiter, the letter Kaph, ::>, and the Tarot symbol of the Wheel of Fortune. The 20th .tEthyr corresponds to Malkuth in Briah. Assigned to Heh (i1), Briah is that one of the Four Worlds which lies between the Divine World of Atziluth, and the transient, labile, volatile Yetziratic world which is the domain of human personality. For most people it is rightly designated the \"spiritual\" world, in con­trast to the \"natural\" world of Yetzirah (though there is nothing \"unspiritual\" about the \"natural\"). Briatic consciousness, increas­ingly, is the native state of the Adept. Qabalists describing Briah have used substantially the same expressions as those Hindus who have written of samadhi. And what a vision we are given! In contrast to Malkuth in As­siah (the sensory, physical world of most people's day-to-day ex­perience) or Malkuth in Y etzirah (a psychological representation of the field of the four elements, as in the Vision of the 30th .tEth­yr), Malkuth in Briah discloses the Kingdom, the fully manifest world, as a pattern of interlocking, inter-relating wheels. We are given a glimpse of the reality behind life and events in the world as we know it - if we are astute enough to see it and understand it. The \"night, with the stars therein\" in this vision is essentially the same as the \"deep night-blue\" that peeked through the veil of the 21st .tEthyr preceding.

They are of­ten compared to the twin channels of Fire and Water that rise on either side of the spine. Normally, Tav, n, completes them; but here, Fire and Water are completed by Air, their natural child and mediator. This is accomplished by replacing Aleph, �, \"the First,\" for Tav, n, \"the Last.\" This pattern is worthy of meditation; much may be derived from it. In particular, Fire, Air, and Water provide a close analogy to the three gunas, or Characteristics of the Mani­fest, which are the object of much of the present vision . The Wheel of Fortune in Tarot (Atu X) summarizes the Sam­khya doctrine of Purusha and prakriti. One common way to trans­late these words is to characterize Purusha (lit., \"person\") as the one who sees (\"the seer\"), and prakriti (lit., \"primal substance\") as \"the seen.\" Purusha is the central idea of Self, corresponding to the letter Yod, �; and Yod, in Hebrew, means not only \"hand\" but also \"axle\"; it is \"the axle of the wheel\" of Liber Legis 2:7. Pra­kriti is everything else that is not Purusha. She is often called \"nature,\" i.e., anything soever that extends from, or is a character­istic of, Purusha. Prakriti is always changing. Her changes are in terms of the three gunas called Tamas, Rajas, and Sattva in the East, and Salt (8), Sulphur ( 4' ), and Mercury (9), respectively, in Western alchemy. They resemble, but are not exactly, what we al­so know as Water, Fire, and Air, respectively. Kaph, :::>, is the wheel, prakriti. Yod, \\ is the axle, Purusha. This vision of the Wheel of Fortune is thus a Briatic exposition of prakriti, Nature, \"the seen,\" in all of her ecstatic unfolding and change. 1. The dew that was upon the face of the stone is gone, and it is become Jibe a pool of clear golden water. And now the light is come into the Rosy Cross. Yet all that I see is the night, with the stars therein, as they appear through a telescope. And there cometh a peacocb into the stone, filling the whole Aire. It is Jibe the vision called the Universal Peacocb, or, rather, Jibe a repre­sentation of that vision. And now there are countless clouds of white angels filling the Aire as the peacocb dissolves. This may be a description of the physical appearance of the scry­ing stone at the start. It was midmorning in the desert, and Crow­ley was staring into a topaz engraved with a Rosy Cross. Peering"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"206 Visions & Voices through the physical veil, he then began to see an image of space filled with stars, a common representation of Briah. The peacock is the bird sacred to Juno, the feminine expression of Jupiter. The \"countless clouds of white angels\" fit some descriptions of the Chashmalim, or \"Brilliant Ones,\" the Angelic Choir of Jupiter. 2. Now behind the angels are archangels with trumpets. These cause all things to appear at once, so that there is a tremendous confusion of images. And now I perceive that all these things are but veils of the wheel, for they all gather themselves into a wheel that spins with incredible velocity. It hath many colours, but all thrilled with white light, so that they are transparent and lumi­nous. This one wheel is forty-nine wheels, set at different angles, so that they compose a sphere; each wheel has forty-nine spol:?es, and has forty-nine concentric tyres at equal distances from the centre. And wherever the rays from any two wheels meet, there is a blinding flash of glory. It must be understood that though so much detail is visible in the wheel, yet at the same time the im­pression is of a single, simple object. The sounding of archangelic trumpets caused all things to appear at once -all manifest things soever - referring to Malkuth, the Kingdom, the \"ten thousand things\" of the Tao Teh Ching. But, in looking beyond their outward appearance, we see them organized in terms of the Vision of the Wheel. 49 is significant for many reasons: One way of counting the Enochian Calls produces 49; as 7 x 7, 49 is a number sacred to Babalon; and one important form of the Rosy Cross has 49 petals. Given the appearance of the main player for much of this vision, we should note that 49 is the value ofi1�Di1 , ha-taleh, \"the lamb.\" 3. It seems that this wheel is being spun by a hand. Though the wheel fills the whole Aire, yet the hand is much bigger than the wheel. And though this vision is so great and splendid, yet there is no seriousness with it, or solemnity. It seems that the hand is spin­ning the wheel merely for pleasure, it would be better to say amusement. The hand is Y od, �.

A voice comes: For he is a jocund and a ruddy god, and his laughter is the vibration of all that exists, and the earthqual:?es of the soul. The image is of Zeus, i.e., Jupiter. s. One is conscious of the whirring of the wheel thrilling one, lil:?e an electric discharge passing through one. 6. Now I see the figures on the wheel, which have been inter­preted as the sworded Sphinx, Hermanubis and Typhon. And that is wrong. The rim of the wheel is a vivid emerald snal:?e; in the centre of the wheel is a scarlet heart; and, impossible to ex­plain as it is, the scarlet of the heart and the green of the snal:?e are yet more vivid than the blinding white brilliance of the wheel. The emerald snake and scarlet heart are the colors of Venus and Mars. They correspond to the heart and serpent from the Thelemic Holy Book, Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente. (That snake is explicitly called \"emerald\" in 3: 17-18 of that book.) It is also a symbol of Nuit and Hadit, the infinite circumference and center, in their con­tinuing love. 7. The figures on the wheel are darl:?er than the wheel itself; in fact, they are stains upon the purity of the wheel, and for that reason, and because of the whirling of the wheel, I cannot see them. But at the top seems to be the Lamb and Flag, such as one sees on some Christian medals, and one of the lower things is a wolf, and the other a raven. The Lamb and Flag symbol is much brighter than the other two. It J:?eeps on growing brighter, until now it is brighter than the wheel itself, and occupies more space than it did. 8. It speal:?s: I am the greatest of the deceivers, for my purity and innocence shall seduce the pure and innocent, who but for me should come to the centre of the wheel. The wolf betrayeth"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"208 Visions & Voices only the greedy and the treacherous; the raven betrayeth only the melancholy and the dishonest. But I am he of whom it is writ­ten: He shall deceive the very elect. 9. For in the beginning the Father of all called forth lying spir­its that they might sift the creatures of the earth in three sieves, according to the three impure souls. And he chose the wolf for the lust of the flesh, and the raven for the lust of the mind; but me did he choose above all to simulate the pure prompting of the soul. Them that are fallen a prey to the wolf and the raven I have not scathed; but them that have rejected me, I have given over to the wrath of the raven and the wolf. And the jaws of the one have torn them, and the beat? of the other has devoured the corpse. Therefore is my flag white, because I have left nothing upon the earth alive. I have feasted myself on the blood of the saints, but I am not suspected of men to be their enemy, for my fleece is white and warm, and my teeth are not the teeth of one that teareth flesh; and mine eyes are mild, and they !:?now me not the chief of the lying spirits that the Father of all sent forth from before his face in the beginning. 10. (His attribution is salt; the wolf mercury, and the raven sul­phur.) The attributions to these figures of the three gunas and three al­chemical principles may seem, at first, to be quite thoroughly con­fused. This is partly because each partakes, in some measure, of the others; but also because different alchemists characterize the principles in slightly different ways in different contexts. Tamas represents darkness, the unclean, and melancholy (Isis Mourning); Rajas the fiery, ferocious, and devouring (Typhon­Apophis); and Sattva the brilliant and still purity that transcends the Tamas-Rajas duality, appearing to be the apex of attainment (Osiris Risen); yet, like the other two, it is but one more point up­on a circle that ever turns, bringing one no nearer to the center. I assign the \"pure\" Lamb to Sattva, Mercury, and Neshamah (superconsciousness); the ferocious Wolf to Rajas, Sulphur, and Ruach (ego-consciousness); and the black and melancholy Raven to Tamas, Salt, and Nephesh (subconsciousness).

Behold! there are three ordeals in one, and it may be given in three ways. The gross must pass through fire; let the fine be tried in intellect, and the lofty chosen ones in the highest. Thus ye have star & star, sys­tem & system; let not one know well the other! 11. Now the lamb grows small again, there is again nothing but the wheel, and the hand that whirleth it . 12. And I said: \"By the word of power, double in the voice of the Master; by the word that is seven, and one in seven; and by the great and terrible word 210, I beseech thee, 0 my Lord, to grant me the vision of thy glory.\" And all the rays of the wheel stream out at me, and I am blasted and blinded with the light. I am caught up into the wheel. I am one with the wheel. I am greater than the wheel. In the midst of a myriad lightnings I stand, and I behold his face.

In response, he is expanded and made one with the wheel, and experiences the lightnings of Jupi­ter, an image preserved, more than three decades later, in the de­sign of Atu X, \"Fortune,\" for his own Tarot deck. 1 § 10 is likely an interpolation by Crowley's intellect, explaining how he was interpreting the impressions he was receiving; see §§ 17-18 for perspective on this process."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"210 Visions & Voices 14.

From the baseline of these two on the Tree of Life, he in­vokes Kether, the Crown. 15. If one could gaze upon the sun at noon, that might be libe the substance of him. But the light is without heat. It is the vision of Ut in the Upanishads. And from this vision have come all the leg­ends of Bacchus and Krishna and Adonis. For the impression is of a youth dancing and mabing music. But you must understand that he is not doing that, for he is still. Even the hand that turns the wheel is not his hand, but only a hand energized by him. 16. And now it is the dance of Shiva. I lie beneath his feet, his saint, his victim. My form is the form of the God Phtah, in my es­sence, but the form of the god Seb in my form. And this is the reason of existence, that in this dance which is delight, there must needs be both the god and the adept. Also the earth herself is a saint; and the sun and the moon dance upon her, torturing her with delight. The gods mentioned, by name and attribute, are those of the Sun; they are categorically represented by the star Vindemiatrix with which the elevated Jupiter is conjoined. The paradox of the danc­ing youth is the mystery of the \"World Dancer\" traditionally shown on Atu XXI, The Universe, representing many deities who \"dance\" suspended in eternity. Ptah, who is of Kether, is essence, and Seb, who is the earth and of Malkuth is form: Essence and Form, wine and bread, spirit and flesh must coexist to fulfill \"the reason of existence\" expressed in this vision of the spiritualized Kingdom. The vision has all the symptoms of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel: In it, the God and the Adept are conjoined. 17. This vision is not perfect.

And neither is capable. There is no bridge. One can only be conscious of one thing at a time, and as the consciousness moves nearer to the vision, it loses control of the physical and mental. Even so, the body and the mind must be very perfect before anything can be done, or the energy of the vision may send the body into spasms and the mind into insanity. This is why the first visions give Ananda, which is a shocR. When the adept is attuned to Samadhi, there is but cloudless peace. As discussed in Chapter 4, this paragraph gives significant per­spective on the nature of these visions and the experience of re­ceiving and communicating them. It is worthy of study and con­templation. 18. This vision is particularly difficult to get into, because he is I. And therefore the human ego is being constantly excited, so that one comes boeR so often. An acentric meditation practice liRe mahasatipatthana ought to be done before invocations of the Holy Guardian Angel, so that the ego may be very ready to yield itself utterly to the Beloved . The recommendation for an \"acentric meditation practice like ma­hasatipatthana\" should be noted. This meditation technique (re­quired in the training of the Philosophus Grade, 4 °=7°, in A:.A:.) is explained in Crowley's article \"Science & Buddhism,\" and in Chapter 6 of my book, The Mystical & Magical System of the A. ·.A.· .. In brief, it detaches one from the object of one's per­ceptions by \"walking one up\" the Buddhist skandhas, or \"aggrega­tions\" by which one clings to the perception of an ego. The five skandhas are rupa, \"form\"; vedanii, \"sensation\"; sanna, \"perception\"; sankhiira, \"tendency\" or \"impulse\"; and vii'iniina, \"consciousness.\" These bear a reasonably accurate rela­tionship, or correspondence, to the five lower sephiroth in the or­der Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, Netzach, and Tiphereth. In mahasatipatthana, one first acknowledges the name and form of an object, then observes the sensory impression behind the seeming actuality of the object; the perception behind the sensa­tion; an inherent tendency of consciousness to have the perception; and so on. This inward trail eventuates in pure (unperturbed or un­impressed) consciousness."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"212 Visions & Voices 19.

The theme is primarily lunar, with overtones ofVenus-Libra. Let us begin with the astrological indications. No planets are on the angles (until the end; see the comment on §22). In both the Tropical and Sidereal frameworks, the Moon is in her own sign, Cancer; and Cancer/Cheth symbolism abounds. Luna spends most of the vision within 1 a of exact major aspect (an opposition) to Venus, making Moon-Venus the strongest astrological theme of this two-hour period. Furthermore, the Moon-Venus pair exactly squares Crowley's own Venus. The Venus archetype, therefore, was extremely strong in his psyche that night. The 191h JEthyr corresponds to Y esod in Briah. This is the se­phirah attributed to the Moon. (The correspondences are striking, and detailed throughout the commentary below.) Furthermore, POP or (21..0 = Cancer, Libra, Cancer. As Cancer is ruled by the Moon, one excellent hieroglyph of this name would be the scales, or balances, poised between two lunar crescents, :».n..<C.

At first there is a bloc�:? web over the face of the stone. A ray of light pierces it from behind and above. Then cometh a bloc�:? cross, reaching across the whole stone; then a golden cross, not so large. And there is a writing in an arch that spans the cross, in an alphabet in which the letters are all formed of little daggers, cross-hilted, differently arranged. And the writing is: Worship in the body the things of the body; worship in the mind the things of the mind; worship in the spirit the things of the spirit. The black cross, shown here, was the badge of the Hegemon in the Golden Dawn. In his summary of these 30 visions, Crowley con­cluded that this 191h lEthyr introduced him to the Hegemon (the ritual guide or \"one who leads\") for his 8°=3° (Magister Templi) initiation. This is of even greater interest because, in the Golden Dawn, the Hegemon corresponded to the Egyp­tian goddess Maat or the Greek Themis, expres­sions of the Libra archetype active in this cethyr; and this officer was stationed symbolically in Y esod. 1 But notice, then, that the cross turns from black (lead) to gold, as if showing this same energy lifted up to Tiphereth. The Alphabet of Daggers obviously corresponds to Y esod - the Sphere of Air in the Outer (corresponding to that Grade in the A:.A:. where one forges one's magick dagger). However, these early paragraphs seem still to be Y esod in Y etzirah, not in Briah: a veil intervenes until it is rent in § 11. 2.

Now follows a dramatization of the nature of the intellect. Each participant is a thought. The description may be taken as fairly lit­eral. (Do not miss 'chariot' and 'field' = Cheth, n, Cancer.) Gate = 1, Venus; green = Venus; and, in the Chinese zodiac, Libra is represented by a dragon. The dragon's appearance in this vision may be related to the Sun's partile conjunction with Cauda Draconis, \"the tail of the dragon.\" Like the serpent, the dragon symbolizes the primal vital energies rooted in Y esod. 9. And in the midst of the battlefield there is a great tree, liRe a chinar-tree. Yet it bears fruits. And now all the warriors are dead, and they are the ripe fruits that are fallen - the ground is cov­ered with them. So many elements of this vision correspond to details in the old G.D. 2=9 ceremony, one of which is the representation of the Tree of Life in the very midst of the field. The chinar is a tree common in Kashmir. The \"ripe fruit\" of the living, producing tree at the center of the field of consciousness are slain thoughts. 10. There is a laugh in my right ear: \"This is the tree of life.\" The right ear corresponds to Saturn and thus to the path of Tav, n. Saturn now takes brief prominence in the vision. Possibly this is connected to Saturn's exaltation in Libra, or as the path that opens from Malkuth to Y esod; possibly it is only to set the stage for the opening, upward and inward, of the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life through most of the rest of the vision. 11. And now there is a mighty god, SebeR, with the head of a crocodile. His head is gray, liRe river mud, and his jaws fill the whole Aire. And he crunches up the whole tree and the ground and everything."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"220 Visions & Voices Sebek, the crocodile-headed nemesis defeated by Horus, corre­sponds to the path of Tav, n, and the powers of Saturn. He appears here as devourer - not quite the exalted view of devouring Saturn that is commonplace in most Binah symbols of these visions, but related. He marks the path on the Tree of Life by which one gains access to Y esod; and he grants this, in the present place, by rend­ing the veil between Y etzirah and Briah. He swallows up the very ground beneath our feet, removing all solid footing. (In this, he may represent the energies of the Muladhara chakra, also attribut­ed to Saturn and located at the base of the spine.) Suddenly, the whole tone of the vision changes! 12. Now then at last cometh forth the Angel of the JEthyr, who is liRe the Angel of the fourteenth Rey of Rota, with beautiful blue wings, blue robes, the sun in her girdle liRe a brooch, and the two crescents of the moon shapen into sandals for her feet. Her hair is of flowing gold, each sparRie as a star. In her hands are the torch of Penelope and the cup of Circe. The angel identifies herself as being of the path of Samekh, 0, cor­responding to Atu XIV, Art or Temperance: that Path which opens upward from Y esod unto Tiphereth, and the continuation upward ofthe path ofn. She is a symbol ofthe Holy Guardian Angel. The description is mostly straightforward. Her blue is that of Samekh (yet also of Gimel and the higher expression of the Moon that emerges later, in §15). Note the crescent Moons on either side, as in the name POP. More subtly, our glyph for Libra .n.. comes from the Egyptian name of the sign, akhet, meaning \"the place of sun­rise,\" such that the overall description of this angel is a fine teles­ma of the cethyr's name, as of the woman in The Apocalypse 12:1 who was \"clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.\" Penelope, who \"carried a torch\" for Odysseus during his long absence, and Circe, who offered him the cup of her seduction, provide a fascinating variation on the usual wand-and-cup (or Fire and Water) symbolism of Samekh. What they have in common is that they define the aspirant as Odysseus, and his path as a heroic odyssey. (See §15 for an elaboration of this theme.) The angel bears both Penelope's torch and Circe's cup: They do not present an either-or choice. The symbolism of Samekh requires embracing both extremes, as well as their reconciliation."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"�,by Horus, corre­�-He appears favouring Saturn ,these visions, but which one gains place, by rend­ws up the very · g.

And on her mouth, lil:?e a chrysanthemum of radiant light, is a !:?iss, and on it is the monogram I.H.S. The letters I.H.S. mean In Homini Salus and lnstar Hominis Summus, and Imago Hominis deuS. And there are many, many other meanings, but they all imply this one thing; that nothing is of any importance but man; there is no hope or help but in man. \"Chrysanthemum\" comes from the Greek for \"gold flower.\" The reference is thus very much to Tiphereth and the kiss of the Holy Guardian Angel. Normally, I.H.S. is a Christian ecclesiastical en­sign, commonly understood to be the first three letters of the Greek IHIOYI, Iesous, \"Jesus.\" Here the letters serve as no­tariqons (acronyms) of various phrases: In Homini Salus, \"In hu­manity is health (prosperity, well-being, &c.);\" Instar Hominis Summus, \"The Highest is like unto humanity;\" Imago Hominis de­uS, \"God is the image of humanity.\" They are all various ways of saying Deus est Homo, or, \"God is Humanity.\" Though this is normally regarded as the essential mys­tery of Tiphereth, it is rooted in Y esod, and in the arising of the Y esod within us unto Tiphereth. This is hinted by the numeration of both DEUS and HOMO as 45, the Mystic Number ofYesod. 15. And she says: Sweet are my l:?isses, 0 wayfarer that wanderest from star to star.

Ichthys, \"fish,\" is commonly taken as a no­tariqon for the Greek phrase in § 18 meaning, \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior.\" In simple, non-numerical symbolism, Nun means \"fish\" and Qoph corresponds to Pisces, \"the fishes.\" I actually think that this elegant solution discloses the mystery intended, and that the \"add­ing it up\" line is a gratuitous artifact of Crowley's arational trance. However, the text calls for a mathematical solution, so perhaps we should spend a little effort to find one. One part of a solution seems easy: 'Ix9u<; adds to 1,219, and adding the digits (1 + 2 + 1 + 9) gives 13, the number of the Tarot trump Death, attributed to Nun. But there is no such simple solution implicating Qoph. If we are to seek a solution by pure gematria, I suspect that the relationship of 1,219 to Nun, J, Scorpio, and the Tarot trump Death is through TO o, . .u:ya, \"The Omega\" or \"The End;\" and its relationship to Qoph, p, Pisces, and the Tarot trump The Moon is because it is the value of noanowv, Poseidon, the Greek Nep­tune, god of the sea, and planetary ruler of Pisces. But even these modestly clean \"hits\" are neither as dead-on nor as simple as Ich­thys =\"fish,\" J =\"fish,\" and p = Pisces =\"fishes.\" 1,219 factors to 23 x 53, two numbers that have much to do with sexual-genetic inheritance . Crowley never found a numerical solution to this puzzle."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"224 Visions & Voices 19. 'Ix9uc; is only connected with Christianity because it was a hi­eroglyph of syphilis, which the Romans supposed to have been brought from Syria; and it seems to have been confounded with leprosy, which also they thought was caused by fish-eating. 20. One important meaning of 'Ix9uc;: it is formed of the ini­tials of five Egyptian deities and also of five CreeR deities; in both cases a magic formula of tremendous power is concealed.) A further puzzle is provided. Crowley worked out two possible so­lutions (and a few small variations). An Egyptian form was Isis Cnouf Thoth Un-nefer Sekhet (attributed, respectively, to Daleth, Chesed, Chokmah, Tiphereth, and Teth). A Greek form was Iac­chus Chronos Themis Uranus Serapis. There are various problems with each of these; for example, the correct name of the Greek Saturn is Kronos, not Chronos; and Uranus begins with an 0 in Greek. I have never been motivated to explore this particular mys­tery, and leave it as a puzzle for others. 21. As to the Holy Table itself, I cannot see it for the blaze of light; but I am given to understand that it appears in another JEthyr, of which it forms practically the whole content. And I am bidden to study the Holy Table very intently so as to be able to concen­trate on it when it appears. 22. I have grown greater, so that I am as great as the Angel.

He strives for union with the Angel, but fails. At the moment of the vision's climax -exactly at local midnight, with the Sun and Mercury in Scorpio on the midnight meridian - he is given a mys­tery of the Midnight Sun and of the Duat (Underworld): \"Osiris was a black god.\" It is difficult to believe Crowley's margin note that, \"This, to the Seer at that time, was a Revelation of the most appalling terror.\" The teaching was well known, and Crowley was 1 The doctrine implied is that one must not be the child, but the Mother. -AC"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"The Cry of the 19th .tEthyr POP 225 well read in such subjects; and at least one A:.A:. ritual, written by Crowley earlier than December 1909, makes use of this doc­trine quite dramatically.

As discussed lengthily in my analysis of the 281h and 21st .tEth­yrs, this Uranus-Neptune aspect is intensely transformative, both psychologically and spiritually. We are not disappointed, in this regard, by the present vision, which provides a sublime and pro­found interpretation of the Vault of the Adepti1 and elements of the traditional 5=6 ceremony of the Golden Dawn and the 2°=9° ceremony of A:.A: .. Crowley regarded this vision as depicting the \"Vault of prepa­ration\" for the 8°=3° initiation through which he was passing. By this, he seems to have meant what Freemasons and others call the preparatory \"Chamber of Reflection.\" Here, the august and sub­lime chamber of initiation to the Second Order (in both the G.D. and A:.A:.) is employed as the \"chamber of preparation\" for his initiation to the Third Order! 1 The Vault is a consecrated, reason-boggling heptagonal room with large 5' x 8' walls painted in prismatic colors, a white ceiling consisting of symbols of Neshamah, and a black floor portraying the primal forces of subconsciousness centered on a symbol of sacred, intimate union. Simply standing in this physical space in a somewhat sensitized state is consciousness altering and ennobling."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"228 Visions & Voices The gibbous Moon is waning, but seems not to have faded so much as to deprive this vision of an intense spiritual luminosity. Sun is conjunct Mercury. As the vision progresses, the pair ap­proaches the horizon, but does not set; it is not, therefore, to these planets that the pronounced solar themes of this vision can be at­tributed. Solar and mercurial elements are intermixed and inter­changed in this vision - for reasons addressed a little later. Of even greater transient interest is the close trine of the Moon to Mars, with the Moon exactly opposite Crowley's natal Neptune. This combination of planets characteristically produces hideous exaggerated fantasies and \"horror movie\" type dreams, just like those images with which this vision commences. While the sym­bols in the opening paragraph do tie in very well to the rest of the vision, the \"veil\" that here covers the image is surely from Crow­ley's own reactive mental-emotional patterns, stimulated, by the intense magical energies of his invocation, to produce the particu­lar phantasmata there recorded. The Moon remains in Cancer in the Sidereal Zodiac, but has moved into Leo in the Tropical. Either would be descriptive of this vision, since we find both lunar formulre (preliminaries for the A:.A:. Yesod initiation), and the obvious solar formulre (of the Vault &c.). Leo characteristics would be anticipated, in any case, from the first letter of the rethyr' s name.

Persuasive, as well, is the alignment of the individual letters of ZEN, and their astrological correspondences, to the flow of the vi­sion. Z corresponds to Leo (D)-actually, to the solar idea, particu­larly the Sun in southern declination, its annual duat, or under­world, phase (in the Northern Hemisphere) where it sojourns from autumnal equinox through the winter months to spring.

N, or Scorpio (J), is the general sym­bolism of death and transformation, and the Night in which the \"little flame shall utterly expire.\" Together, they symbolize the Sun, which, in its southern declination, is as a germinating seed buried (slain, devoured) in the womb ofNight. Against this symbolism of the name ZEN, we find the attribu­tion of this 18th JEthyr to Hod of Briah. At first, this seems wrong; as already acknowledged, this vision is much more of Tiphereth than of Hod. Yet, it is common for basic solar and mercurial sym­bols to be interchanged in Qabalah. Two classic examples: Michrel is the name of the Archangel of Hod and Mercury, but the Angel of the Sun, as Raphrel is the name of the Archangel of Tiphereth and Sol, but the Angel of Mercury; and yellow is the color most associated with the path of Mercury, ::l, but with the sphere of Sol, while orange is the color most associated with the path of Sol, 1, but the sphere of Mercury. While the solar symbolism is adequately explained by the first letter of the name ZEN, Hod shows primarily through the vision's instructive aspects. Compare the detailed teaching in the present vision, on how to obtain the fullest visions from these rethyrs, with the instruction found later in the 81h JEthyr (Hod in Atziluth) for at­taining to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The two instructions mutually connect on many points. Furthermore, the attribution for the present rethyr is to Hod in Briah, not in Yetzirah. It pertains to more than the intellect; rather, we might say, to the way in which the higher aspects of mind serve as a matrix for intuition or higher guidance. Note the differ­entiation made between Crowley's deep participation in the vision itself (his experiencing it in samadhi) and his witnessing the vi­sions \"from afar off,\" keeping his intellect engaged, so that he was capable of articulating and recording what he experienced. 00. A voice comes before any vision: Accursed are they who enter herein if they have nails, for they shall be pierced therewith; or if they have thorns, for they shall be crowned withal; or if they have whips, for with whips they shall be scourged; or if they bear wine, for their wine shall be turned to bitterness; or if they have a spear, for with a spear shall they be pierced unto the heart.

(And the thorns are thoughts, and the whips are regrets, and the wine is ease, or perhaps unsteadiness, especially in ecsta­sy, and the spear is attachment.) Whatever one takes into the depths of initiation, that thing shall one find therein; but in the Abyss, one can have no such compan­ion. Here, the trappings of Christ's crucifixion are employed to symbolize desires, thoughts, regrets, ease, and attachment. In the initiation to Binah, through which Crowley then was passing, all of these things must be left behind, else they become clinging flot­sam of the Abyss. We are crucified with our desires for Life, Light, and Love that bind us to the symbol of our incarnation. Our heads are pierced to bleeding by the thoughts we carry into the Abyss, so that the blood bums and blinds our eyes. We feel the acute sting of unreleased regrets. Our indolent pleasures tum bitter to the taste. Our attachments pierce us to the heart when our Next Step is their renunciation. These 'requirements' are not general moralizations for life. They are disciplines required for a particular step. The embracing of life, light, and love (for example) is natural and necessary to the Man of Earth. These two paragraphs set the tone for the crucifix­ion scene we are about to witness. 1. And now there dawns the scene of the Crucifixion; but the Cru­cified One is an enormous bat, and for the two thieves are two little children. It is night, and the night is full of hideous things and howlings. This is reminiscent of many interpretations of Atu XV, The Devil, corresponding to A'ayin, lJ, \"eye,\" Capricorn, and signifying the outer, veiling appearance of things. lJ opens unto Tiphereth from Hod, to which this rethyr corresponds. This scene corresponds, as well, to elements of the First Point of the traditional 5=6 ceremony of the R.R. et A. C., which contains a crucifixion re-enactment. As mentioned previously, it is also the type of feverish fantasy, \"full of hideous things and howlings,\" that we might expect from the Moon-Mars transits to Crowley's Neptune. 2.

Verily, I say unto thee, many are the adepts that have lool:?ed upon the bact? parts of my father, and cried, \"our eyes fail before the glory of thy countenance.\" Thrice, in this vision, instruction is given that not so much as the style of a letter may be changed. Though often appearing in scrip­tures of diverse traditions (including Liber Legis), it is strange for a vision of this level, and is not characteristic of other visions in this series. Nor did Crowley follow this advice (as comparison to Fra. O.V.'s original diary transcript of this vision confirms). What it does reflect is a Hod emphasis on the letter and form, combined with The Devil's emphasis on external structure. \"Mountain of Caverns\" is a traditional cognomen of Mt. Abi­egnus, the legendary Sacred Mountain within which the Vault of the Adepts is said to be buried; it is interpreted in §3. The Latin MONS CAVERNARUM enumerates to 156, the value of the Name Babalon, and related ideas (see 156 in Appendix A). The quoted matter is an instructive jest, likely inspired by Exodus 33:18-23 (which also inspires the expletive, \"God's buns!\"): \"And [Moses] said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory ... And rt1i1' said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. And rt1i1' said, Behold .... while my glory passeth by .... thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.\" 3. And with that he gives the sign of the rending of the veil, and tears down the vision. And behold! whirling columns of fiery light, seventy-two. Upon them is supported a mountain of pure crystal. The mountain is a cone, the angle of the apex being sixty de­grees. And within the crystal is a pyramid of ruby, lil:?e unto the great pyramid of Gizeh. This sign (a gesture as of parting a curtain) is attributed to the Dominus Liminis Grade of A.·. A.·. , the veil before Tiphereth. The outer, Y etziratic veil of the vision is now parted and a splendid, sublime vision is given of the inner, in the form of the Sacred Mountain of Initiation and the Vault of the Adepti therein. Seven­ty-two has a diverse significance, mostly summarized by the 72 pentacles (5° segments) of the Zodiac, corresponding to the 72"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"232 Visions & Voices parts of the Shem ha-M'phorash, or \"Divided Name\" of God. But the single most extraordinary confirmation of this vision is that, in the Latin Qabalah Simplex (of which Crowley was entirely igno­rant, so that he could not, consciously, have forged associations to it), 72 is the value of the name ABIEGNUS, the name of the sacred mountain! Other Latin correspondences that seem to have rele­vance here include IGNIS DEI, \"fire of God,\" and VACUUM, \"emp­ty, void.\" The conical shape of the mountain is critical. A right cone is a geometric solid formed from the union of a circle and a right an­gle; that is, of a circle (or rose) and a cross. 1 By analogy to the pinecone, it is a symbol of Bacchus or Iacchus, Greek expressions of ecstasy corresponding to Tiphereth or Kether, respectively. The 60° apical angle indicated that this cone is half of a three­dimensional hexagram. Within its heart is a pyramid carved of ruby, the fiery red stone of Geburah, probably reflecting both the fire implied in the word \"pyramid\" and the essence of Horus, as the stereotype of the Holy Guardian Angel. The Greek nupaJ.w;, \"pyr­amid\" (from the root pyr-, \"fire;\" cf \"pyromaniac\"), enumerates to 831, as does �aAAos, \"phallus\"; so what is shown here is an image of the Sacred Phallus. 831 is al­so the value of the word�!;�, Aleph, ifPeh is enumerated as a fi­nal (� = 800), though the normal enumeration of the word is Il l, one of the Great Numbers of the Sun. Thus, Aleph (�) represents something that combines the natures of the Sun (Ill) and phallus (831 ), and, therefore, is commonly called \"the creative Light.\" The reference to the Great Pyramid is significant because the ratio of its height to its base is 5:8, the width-to-height ratio of the walls of the Vault of the Adepti and the most common integer ra­tio approximating the Golden Mean (to which the lines of a penta­gram conform). 1 See The Canon by William Stirling (London: Elkin Matthews 1897) for an exposition of similar elements of sacred geometry.

The Pastos contains the Essence of the Aspirant, and is in a Chamber containing the Essence of the Universe. This is all ready to be burnt up in the Energy of Aspiration to the Creative Annihi­lation, the Ruby Pyramid or Phallus. Finally, this Pyramid is with­in a Cone, a figure combining the straight line and the circle (Rose and Cross in their purest form) representing the new Universe into which the Old is to be transmuted .... 4. I am entered in by the little door thereof, and I am come into the chamber of the �ing, which is fashioned li�e unto the vault of the adepts, or rather it is fitting to say that the vault of the adepts is a vile imitation of it. For there are four sides to the chamber, which with the roof and the floor and the chamber it­self ma�es seven. So also is the pastos seven, for that which is within is li�e unto that which is without. And there is no furniture, and there are no symbols. This parallels the opening of the Second Point of the traditional 5=6 ceremony. The King's Chamber corresponds to the Adytum, or Holy of Holies, in other systems. A tremendously important doctrine is disclosed here: The seven-fold nature of the Vault of the Adepts is ultimately symbolized not by seven walls, but by the six directions of north, south, east, west, above, and below, con­verging on the center as the seventh point. That is, it is cubical. This concept, detailed in the first chapter of Sepher Yetzirah, was also the basis of (one form of) the traditional 7=4 ceremony, wherein the seven-sided 5=6 Vault appeared, instead, as a cube. This corresponds to the cubical Holy of Holies of the Tabernacle, the cubical adytum of the Greek mysteries, and the alchemical Cubical Stone formed by the folding up of a six-squared cross. s.

The Pastas, the place of burial and transformation within the Vault, is here defined by negative characteristics, appropriate to an initiation unto Binah; that is, it is defined by an absence, a conceptual vacuum. 6.

It is music wonderful beyond all that can be thought . Crowley's footnote is left as in the original; but, in fact, an angel had appeared as early as §2. Remember that 0, Samekh, the He­brew letter attributed to the path wherein the Holy Guardian Angel appears, means, \"that which lifts up.\" The eucharist is of the four elements. The phenomena described are familiar to the mystic. 8. And now we go out of the chamber; on the right is a pylon, and the right figure is Isis, and the left figure Nephthys, and they are folding their wings over, and supporting Ra. 9. I wanted to go bacb to the King's Chamber. The Angel pushed me away, saying: \"Thou shalt see these visions from afar off, but thou shalt not partabe of them save in the manner pre­scribed. For if thou change so much as the style of a letter, the holy word is blasphemed.\" 10. And this is the manner prescribed: For him to have partaken of the visions in their fullness would have led to samadhi on their natures; yet, his goal included the \"bringing back\" of some intelligible products of these visions to share with the world. Therefore, he had to see them \"from afar off,\" rather than participate in them intimately. A new method of obtaining the visions was assigned, for deeper participation in each. This deeper method includes the preparation of the Neophyte of A:.A:. for initiation to the 2°=9° Grade of Zelator. Liber 185, in speaking of this passage, says, \"He shall keep himself free from all other engagements for four whole days from that date.\" Those four days are described in the present passages. Zelatores in pos­session of a copy of Liber CXX\" (the A:. A:. 2 °=9° initiation cer­emony) can compare what is given here to instructions in the ritu­al's text. 11.

Crowley's note elaborated on this instruction: The general idea is to create true appetite in a body purified by fasting and a mind clarified by meditation, so as to make certain of being perfectly intoxicated. It should be needless to say that this state of mind, like all others, should be absolutely willed, crit­icised, and controlled. In exploring the rethyrs by this method, the banishings are as de­scribed in Liber YOD (Liber 831, an A:.A:. instruction giving three methods of reducing the manifold consciousness to the Uni­ty.).

Netzach is the sphere of operation of the planet Venus. As Netzach in Yetzirah (27th .tEthyr) was expressed through symbolism of Pis­ces (Venus' exaltation), Netzach in Briah is expressed here pri­marily through symbolism of Libra, Venus' \"house by day.\" Yet, while the symbolism of Libra and Lamed, I;, predominates for most of the vision, beginning with § 10 this rapidly evolves into symbolism of Gimel, l, the Moon, and The Priestess of Tarot. There are astrological reasons it may have taken this direction; but, more likely, it is intrinsic to the nature of the <ethyr. Gimel (Luna used for Caput Draconis, her node) has significance in the very name of the <ethyr. There is also a natural Qabalistic connec­tion between Luna and Libra, for the Moon, l, enumerates to 3, while Libra, I;, is 30. By \"The Qabalah of Nine Chambers,\" 3 and 30 are understood to be different expressions of a common idea. TAN or );'\":) = Caput Draconis, Taurus, Scorpio. It enu­merates to 9 + 1 +50= 60. This is the value of the letter Samekh, 0, which demarcates the middle part of the Middle Pillar. Samekh is an alternative way to express many ideas encountered through­out this vision. Several words enumerate to 60, reflecting these themes. One word, spelled 1n:::1, depending on what vowels are given it, is variously be-chen, \"by grace\"; bachan, \"tried by fire\"; or bochan, \"testing, examination, trial, proof.\" Another important 'IRJid tolaling to ty. glory. pride. a( The '\"'bead of ' tablet gn·en in Sol and .M IIDroscope for so..

Caput, the North Node of the Moon, corre­sponds to Luna herself (l). Taurus is ruled by Venus, but has the Moon exalted. Scorpio is the polarity of Taurus, and is ruled by Mars. Thus, it is no great surprise, when all of these symbols are blended, that after the dragon's head we see the angel Madimi. She is a planetary angel derived from John Dee's Heptarchical working (see A True & Faithful Relation for this account). Her name is derived from Madim, the Hebrew name for Mars: see the tablet given in the Cry of the 22nd .tEthyr. Sol and Mercury are conjoined somewhat past the IC of the horoscope for the hour this vision began; or at least, it first seems so. The diary in which the vision was recorded has 12:30 - 1:45 (?) a.m. written and crossed out, then 12: 15(?) - 2 a.m. written un­der it (note the question marks). The exact hours of beginning and ending are uncertain. The two times are only 15 minutes apart but, given the overall uncertainty, we cannot place too great a reliance on the time of the vision. If the ending time is correct, Jupiter was exactly rising at the moment of conclusion, which Crowley sum­marized with the words, \"I am happily returned unto the earth.\" A lunar influence is shown by the Moon's continuing transit of Sidereal Cancer. The Tropical Leo Moon has no apparent rele­vance to the vision. The Moon trines Sun-Mercury, and both sextile Jupiter, all within about 1°. In § 7 we are told that tan, the name of the a!thyr, is the Enochian word for \"mercy,\" the name of the sephirah at­tributed to Jupiter. 1. Into the stone there first cometh the head of a dragon, and then the Angel Madimi. She is not the mere elemental that one would suppose from the account of Casaubon. I enquire why her form is different. The \"dragon's head\" is one of the \"seed symbols\" Crowley likely used to start the vision. It corresponds to the first letter of the name TAN. Madimi was discussed above. 2. She says: Since all things are God, in all things thou seest just so much of God as thy capacity affordeth thee. But behold! Thou"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"242 Visions & Voices must pierce deeply into this JEthyr before true images appear. For TAN is that which transformeth judgment into justice. BAL is the sword, and TAN the balances. Begins with a useful truism, then shifts to a teaching of the Enochian Qabalah. Baltan is an Enochian word meaning \"justice.\" The implication of this verse is that bat means 'judgement.\" If so, it does not appear in any other authenticated Enochian transmis­sions, though it would be reasonable since the known word for \"judgement\" is batzizras. By the way, if these words are treated as Hebrew, Bat (��::::t) = 33, Tan (l�'D) = 60, and their combination totals to 93. (See Appendix A for an analysis of 93.) \"Sword\" and \"balances\" are the twin implements of the female figure in Atu VIII, Justice or Adjustment, to which Libra is attributed. 3. A pair of balances appears in the stone, and on the bar of the balance is written: Motion about a point is iniquity. 4. And behind the balances is a plume, luminous, azure. And somehow connected with the plume, but I cannot divine how, are these words: Breath is iniquity. (That is, any wind must stir the feather of truth.) Symbols of Libra are shown. \"Iniquity\" is \"inequity.\" Such motion disturbs the balance. It is completed only by a counteraction that begins to set the whole system into compensatory motion. The plume is the feather of Maat, the Egyptian goddess of Truth (Li­bra). Its blue is the color of Lamed in the Queen Scale (i.e., Libra in Briah). Breath (Ruach, mind, movement) disturbs the feather. (In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the heart, to which Ruach or mind is attributed, is weighed against this feather to determine the righteousness of the soul.) 5. And behind the plume is a shining filament of quartz, suspend­ed vertically from the abyss to the abyss. And in the midst is a winged disb of some extremely delicate, translucent substance, on which is written in the 'dagger' alphabet: Torsion is iniquity. {This means, that the Rashith Ha-Gilgalim is the first appearance of evil.) This filament is a striking image: Crowley identified it as the Mid­dle Pillar of the Tree of Life, an idea that nicely ties together many elements of this vision.

And now an Angel appears, Iitle as he were carven in blaci:l diamonds. And he cries: Woe unto the Second, whom all nations of men call the First. Woe unto the First, whom all grades of Adepts call The First. Woe unto me, for I, even as they, have wor­shipped him. But she in whose paps are the galaxies, and he that never shall be i:lnown, in them is no motion. For the infinite With­out filleth all and moveth not, and the infinite Within goeth in­deed; but it is no odds, else were the space-mari:ls confounded. A black diamond is attributed to the Limitless Light, the Qabalistic Zero or Nuit. The angel pulls back conceptual veils by first de­nouncing the Demiurge (who is only a reflection of the true Divin­ity) and then renouncing the ONE GOD itself. Above these, the an­gel acknowledges Nuit and Hadit as they are described in Liber Legis, and says that \"in them is no motion.\" There are mathemati­cal reasons this is so - by definition, infinity is outside the frame­work of measurement - but the moral effect of these statements is to define them as the only concepts in which there is no \"iniquity.\" 7. And now the Angel is but a shining speci:l of blaci:lness in the midst of a tremendous sphere of liquid and vibrating light, at first gold, then becoming green, and lastly pure blue. And I see that the green of Libra is made up of the yellow of air and the blue of water, swords and cups, judgment and mercy. And this word TAN meaneth mercy. And the feather of Moat is blue because the truth of justice is mercy. And a voice cometh, as it were the music of the ripples of the surface of the sphere: Truth is delight. (This means that the Truth of the universe is delight.) As we progress through these middle and higher rethyrs, some im­ages communicate far more simply by gazing upon them than by attempting to explain them. The image in this verse is one such example. After the image, the text gives a partial explanation, showing the green of Libra balanced between gold (or yellow) and blue, with other associated symbols listed as well. It may mean, for example, that it is love (green) which bridges between the solar gold at the heart of the Adept, and the azure embrace of love"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"244 Visions & Voices which is Nuit. Then we are told that tan means \"mercy\"; so that §2 now can be understood to mean that it is mercy that transforms judgment into justice. The aphorism, \"Truth is delight,\" deserves considerable reflection. It certainly explains the relationship of Venus and Maat! 8. Another voice cometh; it is the voice of a mighty Angel, all in silver; the scales of his armour and the plumes of his wings are liRe mother-of-pearl in a frameworR of silver. And he sayeth: Justice is the equity that ye have made for yourselves between truth and falsehood. But in Truth there is nothing of this, for there is only Truth. Your falsehood is but a little falser than your truth. Yet by your truth shall ye come to Truth. Your truth is your troth with Adonai the Beloved one. And the Chymical Marriage of the Al­chemists beginneth with a Weighing, and he that is not found wanting hath within him one sparR of fire, so dense and so in­tense that it cannot be moved, though all the winds of heaven should clamour against it, and all the waters of the abyss surge against it, and all the multitude of the earths heap themselves upon it to smother it. Nay, it shall not be moved. Next is the beginning of a transition from Venus to Luna. This new angel is of silver with mother-of-pearl. He explains 'capital-T Truth' as transcending the polarized duality of truth and falsehood. \"Your falsehood is but a little falser than your truth\" is a koan to those who do not already understand it, and is a beginning of the shift of consciousness from below to above the Abyss. This paragraph is worthy of attentive study. It defies brief comment. We should at least acknowledge the statement, \"Your truth is your troth with Adonai the Beloved one,\" i.e., with the Ho­ly Guardian Angel. The \"spark of fire\" in the final two sentences is the virgin-pure Y od, ', Yechidah, Purusha, or Atman; that is, Hadit, the Indivisible Self. 1 And it is true that neither all the winds of heaven, nor all the surging waters of the Abyss, nor all the mul­titude of the earth can displace the course of one who is wholly and truly going in the way of his or her True Will. 9.

And the method and the form of invocation whereby a man shall attain to the Rnowledge and conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel shall be given unto thee in the proper place, and seeing that the word is deadlier than lightning, do thou meditate straitly thereupon, soli­tary, in a place where is no living thing visible, but only the light of the sun. And thy head shall be bare.1 Thus mayest thou be­come fitted to receive this, the holiest of the Mysteries. And it is the holiest of the Mysteries because it is the Next Step. And those Mysteries which lie beyond, though they be holier, are not holy unto thee, but only remote. (The sense of this passage seems to be, that the holiness of a thing implies its personal relation with one, just as one cannot blaspheme an unRnown god, because one does not Rnow what to say to annoy him. And this explains the perfect inefficiency of those who try to insult the saints; the most violent attacRs are very often merely clumsy compliments.) The words, \"a score and half a score\" should be, \"a score and a half scores,\" i.e., 30 x 20 = 600; such that the whole is 666. It re­fers to Crowley, unto whom The Book of the Law was delivered by Aiwass. 2 It is in this present paragraph that Aiwass is flatly stated to be Crowley's \"guardian\"-that is, his Holy Guardian Angel­something Crowley did not consciously recognize for many years after Liber Legis was dictated. The \"method and form\" of invoking the H.G.A. is given later, in the Cry of the 8th lEthyr. The holiness of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is praised, and it is con­firmed as \"the Next Step.\" Most of the meaning here is evident without comment. (This is an exceedingly rational, instructive rethyr, despite all of its other components. Probably the angular Sun-Mercury conjunction was being felt.) 1 This I performed in a sort of cave upon the ridge of a great mountain in the Desert near Bou-Siiada at 12-3 p.m. on December 2.-AC 2 This error is in every prior edition of The Vision & the Voice, and appears to be in the original hand-written record of the vision.

This has its face downwards, and rains nectar day and night. \"Triple\" and \"silver\" refer to Gimel, the Moon. 73 is the value of the word Gimel (\",i'Jl), and of Chokmah (i17J:>n), \"wisdom,\" the sephirah attributed to the \"Sphere of the Stars.\" As a triangle in­herently symbolizes 3, and the Eye is l7 = 70, their union is also 73. Through the path of Gimel descends the influence called mezla, �\",m = 78, referring to the 78 cards of Tarot, and to Ai­wass. (Crowley then believed Aiwass' name enumerated to 78). 12.

In 1909 (and until the discovery of Pluto in 1930), these were the two outermost known planets, charting, therefore, the longest astronomical epoch that could be marked by two known solar system bodies. This alone would be sufficient to characterize their major aspects as epochal; but, as we have previ­ously discussed, the nature of these two planets in combination is stimulative of psycho-spiritual evolution - or at least very altered states of consciousness! German astrologer Reinhold Ebertin summarized the combination as, \"The elimination of ego­consciousness.\" Their conjunction around 1992 ushered in the full blossoming of the \"New Age\" movement. Something similar marked the era around 1909, which was (for example) the first year that a person of average income could afford an automobile. The angel Gabriel visited William Wade Harris in 1909, fuelling a new religious wave in Africa. Publication of The Fundamentals began the wave of Protestant Fundamentalism in earnest that year; yet Futurism, as well, came into being with the publication of Ma­rinetti's manifesto. Marx's Das Kapital appeared in English trans­lation, Freud's tour of the United States began popularizing a dif­ferent kind of religion called psychoanalysis and - oh yes, I nearly forgot - THE EQUINOX began to be published.

This wave of conceptual revolution crested on December 2 when the opposition was exact. Since the two planets were square Aleister Crowley's Sun, these energies had a very intimate effect on him when they reached their peak. Observe that, at the time of this vision of the 16th JEthyr, Ura­nus and Neptune were only one minute of arc from exact aspect. This is their closest aspect in any of these visions. (The precise opposition was shortly before midnight, later that evening.) Commencing a few minutes after sunset, the vision began with Sun and Mercury conjoined near the Descendant, and the Moon past, but still near, the IC. The Sun-Mercury sextile to Jupiter is very exact. This is a \"royal\" (solar-jovian) vision, depicting the \"setting,\" or dying, of a king. As it progressed, Pluto crossed the Ascendant; and Crowley called this a vision of Kether, which would be consistent with Pluto's essential nature. (Pluto conjoined the Ascendant about the time § 16 was being transcribed.) The Moon was in her last quarter, in Sidereal Cancer or Tropi­cal Leo. The Cancer themes of the vision could otherwise be ex­plained by the L (§) in LEA, just as all Leo symbols are easily explained by the angular Sun; so it is hard to judge the lunar zodi­acal influences. Both themes are present in the vision, whether from zodiacal or other causes, and in somewhat complementary ways: Most of the vision focuses on the idea of the king, but par­ticularly on his collapse and fall (perhaps best shown astrological­ly by the vision's commencement at the setting of the Sun). One important consequence of this, then, was to release the feminine from much of her Old lEon constraint and to reflect the promise of the mystical and maternal. LEA or:(!;= Cancer, Virgo, Taurus. It enumerates to 30 + 8 + 1 = 39. Although 39 is the value of several variations of Tetra­grammaton, these particular forms do not correspond well to the particular aspects of patriarchal godhead dramatized in this vision. For example, the great Name 1m� rr1i1', which we later will en­counter as a sacred seven-fold Name reflecting the triumph ofBa­balon, seems to miss the mark here. Specifically, L is attributed to the waning Moon, so that the images in § 1 are an exact match for these letters. This is one of the"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"252 Visions & Voices more striking examples suggesting that Crowley used the technical methods he learned in the Second Order of the Golden Dawn, which would have had him formulate some such image as a pre­liminary to help \"tune\" his psyche to the portion of the astral plane he wished to explore. Finally, this rethyr corresponds to Tiphereth in Briah. It is the awakening of the aspirant to Tiphereth in Briah that characterizes the 5°=6° Grade of Adeptus Minor wherein is experienced the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, a phe­nomenon that manifests most beautifully near the end of this pre­sent vision. Before that, we have a more outward expression of the solar sphere as well: Qabalists call Tiphereth \"The King.\" 1. There are faint and flicl:?ering images in a misty landscape, all very transient. But the general impression is of moonrise at mid­night, and a crowned virgin riding upon a bull. The vision was undertaken just minutes after sunset, on a moon­less night. The vision's setting is wholly lunar (symbolized either by the prominent Sidereal Cancer Moon or by the Lin LEA). The three symbols are those of the letters of LEA, viz., the waning Moon (L, Si), the Virgin (E, rtl>), and the Bull (A, (:f). The \"angel\" at the beginning is very lunar-Cancerean in nature and demeanor as well. 2. And they come up into the surface of the stone.

And this is the salvation of the world, that always I am de­ceived by some god, and that my child is the guardian of the labyrinth that hath two-and-seventy paths. Mythology is filled with examples of a maiden coupling with some god, usually disguised as some sort of beast, and bringing forth a hero or demigod as her son. This popular myth is quite po­tent and persistent in the human psyche, and can reveal many in­sights when taken into meditation.

Now she is gone. 4. And now there are Angels, walbing up and down in the stone. They are the Angels of the Holy Sevenfold Table. It seems that they are waiting for the Angel of the JEthyr to come forth. The Holy Sevenfold Tablet, \"containing seven Names of God which not even the Angels are able to pronounce,\" has already been given in the 22nd lEthyr. A simplified version is given below . Numerous categories of angelic names are derived from it, the chief of which are (what appear to be) archangelic names corre­sponding to the seven planets. S A A £ M £ B T Z K A S £ H £ D £ D £ N £ M 0 l A M £ G C B A l A 0 V N H R l A A l §§5-15: The king (the angel of the cethyr; note that the angels ofTipher­eth are the Melekim, or \"Kings\") is representative both of the Osiris lEon in general (the old era of patriarchal dominion), and of Crowley's self­conscious ego in particular. This vision symbolizes the slaying of both of these things. He bears the colors and accouterments of royalty. He un­dergoes the classic initiation drama of being divested of his insignia, stripped of his trappings. Though his drama continues at length, the basic message is quite simple: The rule of this king (the Ruach, or reason and ego) is over. The lEon of Horus now supervenes in its place. Because this essential meaning is so clear, I shall comment more sparsely on many of these verses. s. Now at last he appears in the gloom. He is a mighty King, with aown and orb and sceptre, and his robes are of purple and gold."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"254 Visions & Voices And he casts down the orb and sceptre to the earth, and he tears off his crown, and throws it on the ground, and tramples it. And he tears out his hair, that is of ruddy gold tinged with silver, and he plucl:?s at his beard, and cries with a terrible voice: Woe unto me that am cast down from my place by the might of the new JEon.

Blessed are they who have turned the Eye of Hoor unto the zenith, for they shall be filled with the vigour of the goat. \"The Lord of the Flame and the Lightning\" is the traditional title of the Knight (i.e., the King) of Wands, or Yod-of-Yod in Tarot; here it would seem to signify simply the primal, fiery Y od, ', the purest spiritual will-force manifest as the \"lightning flash,\" which is the instantaneous manifestation of all the sephiroth of the new world. The end of the verse describes visual elements of Atu XVI, The Tower. The final sentence is somewhat obscure until we re­member that this Eye (or A'ayin, lJ), which corresponds to the constellation of the Goat, is also attributed to the anus! This pos­ture, which may be regarded as that of the utmost humility, has quite a few different levels of meaning (and we should not forget that one of them is the equation of A'ayin and Capricorn to mirth). It is the posture of the figures caught flying through the air head­first when hurled from the thunder-struck Tower. Crowley's own note says that this posture \"refers to a mystery of magick, practical and puissant, which the student must be left to solve for himself.\" To stir all the elements of the paragraph together into one mix, we note that it is Mars, the planet associated with Atu XVI, The Tow­er, that is exalted (or \"turned unto the zenith\") in Capricorn; and this Eye of Hoor appears, in the Thoth Deck, in Atu XVI as well. 6.

Blessing unto the name of the Beast, for he hath let loose a mighty flood of fire from his manhood, and from his womanhood hath he let loose a mighty flood of water. Every thought of his mind is as a tempest that uprooteth the great trees of the earth, and shal:leth the mountains thereof. And the throne of his spirit is a mighty throne of madness and desolation, so that they that lool:l upon it shall cry: Behold the abomination! Psychological complexities are here that could be lengthily exam­ined. For example, this king seems to be an outer expression (probably Y etziratic) of the Tiphereth idea, in contrast to that which appears in § 16; the veil of the outer has not yet been rent in this particular vision. Therefore, the king (interpreted as one would in a dream) is a symbol of Crowley's own ego, which, though abased by the passage through these a::thyrs thus far, here is able to aggrandize itself by exalting the majesty and supremacy of this Beast with which Crowley so identified himself. On the other hand, despite that ego-fantasy, what is said here about this Beast is entirely true; for it is not actually a man, but is the collective Chi­ah, or Wisdom, of humanity. The man was but its avatar. Crowley notes a relationship of these sentences in §§8-9 to Li­ber VII 3:20-23: 20Let it be soon, 0 God, my God! I ache for Thee, I wander very lonely among the mad folk, in the grey land of desolation. 21Thou shalt set up the abominable lonely Thing of wickedness.

It is, as well, a symbol of the manifestation of Horus in the world. 10. Great is the Beast that cometh forth lil:?e a lion, the servant of the Star and of the Snal:?e.

Most of this paragraph is from \"The Bomless Ritual,\" an ancient Greek magical ceremony that Crowley later adapted into the offi­cial A:.A:. instruction Liber Samekh. Crowley had used this cer­emony three years earlier, in 1906, to attain to the Knowledge & Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. These are some of the most powerful, compelling lines in the whole canon of ceremonial magick: Hear Me: and make all Spirits subject unto Me: so that every Spir­it of the Firmament and of the Ether: upon the Earth and under the Earth: on dry Land and in the Water: of Whirling Air, and of rush­ing Fire: and every Spell and Scourge of God may be obedient un­to Me.

And the spirit of prophecy shall come upon me despite me ever and anon, as even now upon my heart and upon my throat; and upon my tongue seared with strong acid are the words: Vim patior. For so must I give glory to him that hath supplanted me, that hath cast me down into the dust. I have hated him, and with hate my bones are rotten. I would have spat upon him, and my spittle hath befouled my beard. I have tahen up the sword against him, and I am fallen upon it, and mine entrails are about my feet. Vim patior means, \"I suffer attack,\" or \"I surrender to great force.\" By the Latin Qabalah Simplex, it enumerates to 110. Other Latin words and phrases enumerating to 110 include CRUX ROSEA, \"the Rosy Cross;\" both HERU-PA-KRAATH (the name of the God of Si­lence) and SILENTIUM, \"silence;\" TEMPERANTIA, \"temperance,\" the title of the XIVth Trump corresponding to D; and APOSTALUS, \"apostle\" (from a root meaning \"messenger\"). Therefore, all of the forces that attack and wound this king are symbols of the Holy Guardian Angel. 14. Who shall strive with his might?

And now he is fallen quite to the ground, in a heap, and dust is upon his head; and the throne upon which he sat is shat­tered into many pieces.

The punishments he mentions are the penalties at­tached to the first two degrees of Craft Freemasonry, which he seems willing to accept-but not to the 3°, a mystic celebration of death, which is upon him and which, so far, he continues to resist. 16.

And I tooR her hand and Rissed it, and I say to her: Am I not nearly purged of the iniquity of my forefathers? An indication of Crowley's shifting relationship to the feminine is shown, during his approach to Binah. Her gesture links his enjoy­ment of her yoni to his enjoyment of his Angel: \"As below, so above,\" so to speak. The iniquity of his forefathers is the fatal sex­ism that characterized the Osiris Age and its religions: She says he is not doing too badly, but still has further to go. Her promise de­scribes him in the Sign of Mulier, which is the Sign of the Master of the Temple, 8°=3°, evidently a promise of what lies not far ahead of him. 20.

His visions for all three of these began with the Uranus-Neptune opposition on the angles of the horoscope. As has been discussed previously, this powerful aspect (only 0°02' wide for the present vision) is inherently transforma­tive of ego-consciousness, and its close square to Crowley's Sun is superbly descriptive of this event of crossing the Abyss. Additionally, Venus is on the Eastpoint of the horoscope for this vision of the 151h J'Ethyr. While this is fitting for certain details (the dancer and the rose, for example), it is difficult to distinguish its influence from those of Venus-ruled Libra in the name OXO, discussed below. The Moon is near Last Quarter. This is traditionally viewed as a weakening, unluminous phase, a time when chthonic and disin­tegrative forces are more prevalent. Its Hecatean characteristics would not be ideal for most magical operations, but are exactly right for the breaking up and dismantling of Crowley's ego struc­ture in the passages now before us. Several exact planetary aspects appear in this chart. The ongo­ing Sun-Mercury conjunction (here only 0°03' wide) may be inter­preted as \"examination\" - and we may read their partile sextiles to"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"\"' E£thyrs 15, 14, and '-m in the World of ll ceremony\" into the a b all three of these -the angles of the l this powerful aspect �ntly transforma­l1o Crowley's Sun is lie Abyss.

In both the Tropical and Sidereal zodiacs, the Moon is in Leo. Symbols that might be leonine (the rose, the golden cross) are more clearly related to other factors in the horoscope and the reth­yr's name, making Leo itself hard to discern. Overall, Leo is a constellation of royalty and of great light, corresponding to the Hebrew letter Teth, D, the highest path on the Tree of Life that is wholly below the Abyss. Teth symbolizes the climax of the Order of the Rosy Cross. What is truly expressive of the nature of the vision are the Enochian letters composing the rethyr's name. OXO or l..f 1.. = Libra, Earth, Libra. It enumerates to 70 + 400 + 70 = 540. This number is unimpressive. Besides a couple of achievement-related words (such as T1J1V, sh 'khariakh, \"your reward\") there is nothing of note. This vision does not respond well to gematria. However, the symbolism of the individual letters decisively de­termined the architecture of the vision! Libra (Atu VIII, Adjust­ment) provides the image of the dancer and weaver in the opening paragraphs, while Earth, Tav, n, which literally means \"cross,\" provides the symbolism of that whereupon her Rose is centered. The other symbolism intrinsic to the rethyr is its correspond­ence to Geburah of Briah. This is subtler than in previous rethyrs, and is interwoven with the Libra/Justice themes of the name OXO. (The highest name of sephirah 5 is Din, r1, \"Justice.\") There is also a theme, in this vision, of the ordeal of trial. As well, the alle­gories in §§22-23 might be taken as expressions of the phrase, \"Wisdom says: be strong,\" from Liber Legis 2:70. There is also the scarlet flame, the first image of the entire vision, from which the rest unfolds. 1. There appears immediately in the JEthyr a tremendous column of scarlet fire, whirling forth, rebounding, crying aloud. And about it are four columns of green and blue and gold and silver, each inscribed with writings in the character of the dagger. And the column of fire is dancing among the pillars. Now it seems that the fire is but the sbirt of the dancer, and the dancer is a mighty god. The vision is overpowering."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"264 Visions & Voices The language of this verse is drawn, in part, from The Chaldean Oracles. The scarlet flame, besides representing Geburah, is also the dancer that is a form of the Scarlet Woman. The Alphabet of Daggers, first seen in the 19th lEthyr, signifies that the vision opens in Y etzirah, fuelled at first by the continuing presence of the rational mind, as a veil for the deeper content that is to follow. 2. As the dancer whirls, she chants in a strange, slow voice, quid?­ening as she goes: Lo! I gather up every spirit that is pure, and weave him into my vesture of flame. I lie!:? up the lives of men, and their souls sparl:?le from mine eyes. I am the mighty sorceress, the lust of the spirit. And by my dancing I gather for my mother Nuit the heads of all them that are baptised in the waters of life. I am the lust of the spirit that eateth up the soul of man. I have prepared a feast for the adepts, and they that partal:?e thereof shall see God. She is the goddess of Lamed, �, Adjustment, an expression of Ba­balon weaving the fabric of experience from the threads of karma. It is She that \"harvests\" adepts for the Ordeal of the Abyss. In fact, in one sense, She is the engulfing, devouring Abyss. Her words, though also referring to something much deeper than mortality, quite bluntly disclose important technical methods of the sexual mysteries. The reference to \"heads\" equates Nuit to Kali ('��::::> = 61 = 1'�, \"nothing\"= Nuit), and caused Crowley to equate the dancer to Salome claiming the head of John the Baptist. (Crowley was always a great fan of Wilde.) The \"waters of life\" refer to Chesed, and are set in contrast to the \"waters of death\" that shall be encountered later. 3. Now it is clear what she has woven in her dance; it is the Crim­son Rose of 49 Petals, and the Pillars are the Cross with which it is conjoined. And between the pillars shoot out rays of pure green fire; and now all the pillars are golden. She ceases to dance, and dwindles, gathering herself into the centre of the Rose. This rose of 7 x 7 petals is sacred to Venus, Li­bra, and Babalon. Its 49 petals and single center refer to the 50 Gates of Binah, or Understand­ing. The use of \"crimson\" rather than the previ­ous \"scarlet\" is significant, since crimson is the color attributed to Binah in Atziluth. The dancer 1be �-en Major. 70=40 Magus. I 00= I 0�� ...

This opening image consoli­dates all of the basic symbolism of the name OXO discussed above. The English form of the letters OXO infer the uniting of the circle ( 0) and cross (X) symbolism that is manifest in the Rosy Cross emblem. 4. Now it is seen that the Rose is a vast amphitheatre, with seven tiers, each tier divided into seven partitions. And they that sit in the Amphitheatre are the seven grades of the Order of the Rosy Cross. This Amphitheatre is built of rose-coloured marble, and of its size I can say only that the sun might be used as a ball to be thrown by the players in the arena. But in the arena there is a little altar of emerald, and its top has the heads of the Four Beasts, in turquoise and rocR-crystal. And the floor of the arena is ridged liRe a grating of lapis lazuli. And it is full of pure quicR­silver. As Uranus and Neptune came exactly to the horizon, and the Moon-Pluto aspect became exact, this rose (depicted opposite) was next perceived as an enormous amphitheater. How enormous? From the proportion of our Sun to a ball, it is at least half the size of our Milky Way galaxy! We might best understand it actually to be the whole of our spiraling galaxy. (It was woven by the dancer, from the flaming fabric of her vestments. This tells us far more of who She is than all her other symbols.) The seven grades are 5°=6° Adeptus Minor, 6°=5° Adeptus Major, 7°=4° Adeptus Exemptus, 8°=3° Magister Templi, 9°=2° Magus, 10°= 1° Ipsissimus, and the unnamed 11 °=0° (or 0°=0°) Grade, passing even beyond the normal numeration of the A:.A:. Grades. At its center, into which the dancer gathered Herself a moment before, is an emerald altar, that is in one sense the dancer herself (emerald being the color of Libra, as of Venus). It depicts bhakti (love, devotion) as the basis of worship.1 The altar's sym­bolism is both complex and sublime. At the comers of its top sur­face are the heads of the four Kerubim, as seen on Atu XXI, The Universe (which corresponds to the letter X in OXO). They are formed by stones that Crowley, in Liber 777, associated with See Liber Legis 3:30 where \"brass\" is a familiar alchemical veil for copper, the metal of Venus."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"266 Visions & Voices Malkuth (the Kingdom of the Elements) and Chokmah (the circle of stars). Perhaps this shows that these emblems of elemental and zodiacal powers partake, at once, of both realms. The lapis lazuli floor resembles the star-strewn field of night and space itself, but crosshatched, it is the body of Nuit and a symbol of Binah. The \"pure quicksilver\" likely refers to the higher Mercury attributed to Chokmah, or which descends upon the Great Sea of Binah by the path of Beth, :I, in the Vision of the Universal Mercury. It is the semen of the stars, filling the soft folds of night, the condensation of stellar dew within the body ofNuit. 5. Above the altar is a veiled Figure, whose name is Pan. Those in the outer tier adore him as a Man; and in the next tier they adore him as a Goat; and in the next tier they adore him as a Ram; and in the next tier they adore him as a Crab; and in the next tier they adore him as an Ibis; and in the next tier they adore him as a Golden Howl:?; and in the next tier they adore him not. Pan, nav, the name of the familiar rural goat-god of the Greeks, is also their word for \"all.\" Pan is The All, here enigmatically veiled like Isis. He is the Fifth Beast above and in the midst of the tradi­tional Four Beasts, thus the symbol of the Quintessence that com­pletes them and formulates the pentagram from their quaternity. The members of each Grade adore him, of necessity, through their own projections, as an image of their respective hidden natures: as a man (Tiphereth, the heart of humanity), a goat (Geburah: Capri­corn as the exaltation of Mars and a symbol of strength and sexual ardor), a ram (Chesed: for Amoun), a crab (Binah: for Cheth, Can­cer, maternity, &c.), an ibis (Chokmah: implying Thoth), and a golden hawk (Kether: for Heru-Ra-Ha). Those beyond even this \"adore him not,\" i.e., as The Not, or Negative (A yin). 6. And now the light streameth out from the altar, splashed out by the feet of him that is above it. It is the Holy Twelve-fold Ta­bleOIT. Given the stellar symbolism so prominent in this vision, it surely is no accident that a 12-fold tablet was chosen, implying the zodiac.

And the mysteries of the Table shall not be wholly revealed, nor shall they be re­vealed herein. But thou shalt gather of the sweat of thy brow a pool of clear water wherein this shall be revealed. And of the oil that thou burnest in the midnight shall be gathered together thirteen rivers of blessing; and of the oil and the water I will pre­pare a wine to intoxicate the young men and the maidens. \"The voice in the silence,\" besides being a mystical term often ex­pressive of the Holy Guardian Angel, is also a technical Qabalistic term. In The 32 Paths of Wisdom, Daleth (Venus, love) is called chashmal, �7J'tZ.m, a Hebrew pun from the technical Rabbinical language of the diaspora period. It means \"speaking silence.\" In its plural, it is also the name of the Angelic Choir of Chesed. In the vision, the words are heard to echo in the minds of the Adepti convened, and are therefore a reflection (that is, a projection) of what it stirs in their psyches. The reference to the Sabbath is to Saturn (Heb. ��n:nv, Shabbathai), or Binah. \"The Sabbath of the Adepts\" of the 8th LEthyr refers to the Knowledge and Conversa­tion of the Holy Guardian Angel.

Each Adept employs words and symbols corresponding to one of the Grades. It would not surprise anyone who has worked in the A:. A:. system that this is an examination of actual acquired char­acteristics. Lest it go unnoticed, we should acknowledge something ex­traordinary that occurs in this cethyr, which has occurred in none of the earlier ones. Although Aleister Crowley had encountered angels and gods, mythic beasts and sacred guardians, he had not -until now - encountered in this series of visions what appears to be another human being. Crossing the threshold into the 15th JEthyr appears to have placed him directly in the presence of adepti and magisteri from many worlds converging on one locus of the inner planes. We can debate whether these (as if in a dream) are mere constructions of his subconscious mind, or are actual encounters with discrete beings. Over the course of his life, both before and after this initiatory experience in late 1909, Crowley communicat­ed with several masters and guides by telepathic means - it was usually unclear whether they were then in physical bodies some­where or disembodied, and, mostly, it doesn't matter-but that had not been part of the current cycle of inner experiences. With this Cry of the 15th JEthyr, that changed. From the visions, it appears that he was in the presence of initiators and instructors who found him ready to be admitted into deeper levels of understanding, and to assume deeper levels of responsibility for humanity. 9.

And the fourth Adept examines my necb, and seems to ap­prove, though he says nothing; and he hath opened the right half of my brain, and he mabes some examination, and says: \"Sa­majh, samajh, samajh.\" The fourth Adept first examines the neck, corresponding to Da'ath, and is silent. The rest refers to Binah, Understanding, 8°=3°, anatomically the brain's right hemisphere. Sanskrit is the classical language of the oldest and deepest mysticism.

Thou, o prophet, shalt not behold all these mysteries hidden therein\" (Liber L., 1 :54). There is an evident relationship of the Thelemic pantheon to the Enochian hierarchies, especially through Baba­lon, so it would not be surprising if the title were, in fact, the Enochian word L lpronounced \"El,\" just like the Hebrew ��), meaning \"God, One, The First.\" This Enochian letter (and title?)

Note that the listed stars cannot all be above the horizon at one time, anywhere on earth. The view is, therefore, not of any view­able sky seen from Earth: It must be a view from space. Other than Polaris, the stars roughly form two opposing curves, raising the question of whether there is any place where they even approxi­mate (by underlying) the horizon. There is: For the stars actually named, it is 51N36, the latitude ofLondon!1 It is fascinating that this teaching regarding the fixed stars emerged in this specific vision. At the time, the Moon was ap­proaching the bright star Regulus (Cor Leonis), and exactly cul­minating with it.2 The Sun, though 2° of longitude past the Aldeb­aran-Antares axis, was still so close as to rise exactly with Antares that morning. The Sun also set that day at the same time that Regulus and the Moon crossed the Midheaven. Thus, both lumi­naries were connected to some of the brightest of the named stars. The stars in question are also closely related to each other zodi­acally, as the appended table shows. Aldebaran and Antares (from ancient times the exactly opposed stellar pair that defined the pa-1 This is also approximately the latitude of Crowley's birthplace in Leamington Spa, 52Nl8. : The Moon was 5°11' north of the ecliptic, so it did not cross the angles at the same time as the part of the ecliptic marking its longitude.

The Pleiades, Regulus, and Alpha Centauri form an exact T -square among them­selves (5° Taurus, Leo, and Scorpio, respectively). The brightest star in Orion (Betelgeuse) is in the same degree as the Pole Star, and Orion's second brightest star (Rigel) is exactly opposite the brightest in Hercules. The \"Eye of the Ram\" is 2° from an exact square to a Aquilce (Altair), but in exact square to part of the con­stellation. Of the named stars, this leaves only Spica at 29° Virgo, seemingly alone. It may be significant, though, that the \"closest fit\" of these stars to the London-area horizon is during the approx­imate time that the Midheaven is dominated by the bright star Arc­turus - which is also at 29° Virgo. What is even more astounding is that Arcturus was on the Midheaven at the time that this present vision commenced: although it is at 29° Virgo of Sidereal longi­tude, it is 31 a north of the ecliptic, and therefore is actually due south (on the Midheaven) when the MC's longitude is 11 a Libra. What all of this means is not yet clear; but an astronomical framework has been identified by these parameters, which may be worth further study to discern further mysteries. One extraordinary astronomical detail is worth consideration in the present context: If the named stars and constellations are traced on a star map, there is a large gap, or gulf, between Polaris and the Aries-Taurus-Orion group. As Crowley was, at this time, near the threshold of that great gap, or gulf, in consciousness called the Abyss, approaching the sephirah Binah, I wondered if this gulf had any significance. Five constellations fill that segment of space: Gemini, Cancer, Auriga, Perseus, and Andromeda. Now, Gemini and Cancer are attributed to the two paths (l and n) opening unto Binah from lower sephiroth. The Tarot trumps attributed to those paths are The Lovers and The Chariot. Auriga is the constellation called the Charioteer; and, in the esoteric Golden Dawn tarot that Crowley had previously learned, The Lovers are depicted as ... Perseus and Andromeda. 1 By marking the precise centers of Scorpio and Taurus throughout all recorded history, Antares (\"the Heart of the Scorpion\") and Aldebaran (\"the Eye of the Bull\") imply the Hebrew letters of Scorpio and Taurus, 1J -that is, they spell the name Nu, the name of the goddess Who is space itself1 Only two other stars share comparable standing in defining the ancient zodiac that was based on the actual stars: Regulus in Leo and Spica in Virgo.

And this pertaineth unto the grade of a Magus, - and that is beyond thine. (All this is communicated not by voice, or by writ­ing; and there is no form in the stone, but only the brilliance of the Table. And now I am withdrawn from all that, but the Rosy Cross of 49 petals is set upright upon the summit of a pyramid, and all is dart?, because of the exceeding light behind.) 22.

As the Cry of the 30 lEthyrs says, Tabaori priaz ar tabas: \"Gov­ern those that govern.\" 24. Now the exceeding light that was behind the Pyramid, and the Rosy Cross that is set thereon, hath fulfilled the whole Aire. The blacl:? Pyramid is lil:?e the bact:? of a blacl:? diamond. Also the Rosy Cross is loosened, and the petals of the Rose are the mingled hues of sunset and of dawn; and the Cross is the Golden light of noon, and in the heart of the Rose there is the secret light that men call midnight. Black, remember, represents the absorption of all light. (Consider the black hole formed from a collapsing star. Its analogy to the Magister is not far-fetched.) In this sense, black is not darkness, but all luminosity. (Actually, it is both at once.) Sunset and dawn are shown, for this absorption into the rose is at once death and birth. The cross is incarnated life. The heart of the rose is \"the sun of midnight.\" Like many vivid passages in The Vision & the Voice, this one may serve you well as the basis of meditation. It marks the beginning of Crowley's descent back through the planes, his return transition to his body (accelerated in §§26-27). 25.

And now the five and the six are divorced, and I am come again within my body. This is Abrahadabra spelled backwards. As Abrahadabra symbol­izes the completion of the Great Work in the uniting of the 5 and the 6, so is Arbadaharba here used to signify the divorcing of the Macrocosm from the Microcosm, of the Rose from the Cross.

Venus' proximity to the Midheaven is little evident, save through the continued (but hardly unexpected) symbol of the Rose.

Further­more, Capricornian symbols are quite evident in both parts of this vision, as will be elaborated in individual paragraphs below. This 14th ..tEthyr corresponds to Chesed in Briah. Candidly, there is little or nothing of Chesed evident in this vision, which so obviously depicts Crowley's induction into the Grade attributed to Binah that no other correspondence makes sense. Therefore, in support of Chesed symbolism, I will make only a single observa­tion: It is the Exempt Adept 7°=4°, the initiate of Chesed, who is inducted into the Grade of Magister Templi 8°=3°. Much that we often see attributed to Binah is actually part of the experience of the Adept who is being drawn thereunto, and not of Binah herself. As evidence, one can offer, for example, that classic text of the 7°=4° Grade, The Dark Night of the Soul by St. John of the Cross. 1. There come into the stone a white goat, a green dragon, and a tawny bull. But they pass away immediately. There is a veil of such darl:?ness before the JEthyr that it seems impossible to pierce it. But there is a voice saying: Behold, the Creat One of the Night of Time stirreth, and with his tail he churneth up the slime, and of the foam thereof shall he mal:?e stars. And in the battle of the Python and the Sphinx shall the glory be to the Sphinx, but the victory to the Python. Capricorn and Taurus on either side of the Dragon: These are symbols corresponding to the letters UTA, used as an entry key in­to the vision. They pass away after a moment, having served their purpose of\"tuning the channel\" on Crowley's inner receiving set. Next follow symbols of Saturn-ruled Capricorn, the letter A'ayin, l7, and Atu XV, The Devil. It is the function of A'ayin, \"the Eye,\" to formulate those seemingly endless and successive veils that lie between normal and undraped perception. \"The Great One of the Night of Time\" is the esoteric title of Atu XXI, The Universe, attributed to Saturn, Tav, n. Saturn is both ruler of Capricorn and the planet corresponding to Binah. The \"night of time\" is eternity-a four-dimensional condition in which time is shed as a limiting condition. The term seems to be used here as a title of a serpent that has taken the place of the dragon, reaching from the depths of slime unto the vault of the stars. It is the serpent that rises from the Muladhara chakra (corresponding to Saturn 3IDOIIIII all the ereth, the in distorting � manageable.

Its initial rising can be seen in Atu XXI of the Thoth deck. Against this is pitted the Sphinx, the sphincter or (literally) \"strangler,\" who is especially attributed to Malkuth and Tav. \"Glory\" is Hod, or form, as \"Victory\" is Netzach, or force; so that the combat be­tween these two is that between the extremes of force and form. 'Python' is an anagram of 'Typhon,' who has importance in this vision. In Latin, both words enumerate to 86, as do the Latin words SERPENS, \"serpent,\" and DRACO NIGER, \"black dragon.\" As well, 86 is the value of the important Latin SAPIENTIA, \"wisdom.\" 2. Now the veil of darbness is formed of a very great number of exceedingly fine blacb veils, and one tears them off one at a time. And the voice says, There is no light or bnowledge or beau­ty or stability in the Kingdom of the Grave, whither thou goest. And the worm is crowned. All that thou wast hath he eaten up, and all that thou art is his pasture until to-morrow. And all that thou shalt be is nothing. Thou who wouldst enter the domain of the Great One of the Night of Time, this burden must thou tabe up. Deepen not a superficies. The veil of darkness is of Saturn; i.e., of Binah, Tav, and Capri­corn all in one. The numerous sheer veils are especially character­istic of the Qabalistic idea of Capricorn: Its correspondence is to the 26th Path of A'ayin, l7, that opens from Hod, Mercury, to Tiph­ereth, the Sun. It represents the role the \"trickster\" intellect plays in distorting Inner Truth in the process of endeavoring to make it manageable in day-to-day commerce. Light, Knowledge, Beauty, Stability, and Kingdom are the se­phiroth of the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life: Kether, Da'ath, Tiphereth, Yesod, and Malkuth. The \"worm\" has attained Kether, the Crown, and is the devourer of all. \"That which was, is, and shall be\" is a reasonably literal translation of the Divine Name rl1i1\\ which enumerates to 26, the value of the sephiroth in the Middle Pillar, 1 + 6 + 9 + 10 (Da'ath having no number and, actu­ally not rightly being counted a sephirah). The last sentence in §2 is from The Chaldean Oracles and means, primarily, not to con­fuse an external or superficial aspect of reality with its depths."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"282 Visions & Voices 3.

By the Rose is meant his eternal, infinite aspect, which is ever unfolding love, even as the Cross signifies his finite, . I mcamate aspect. The \"waters of death\" are set in counterpoint to the \"Waters of Life\" mentioned in the prior cethyr. They correspond to Nun, J, Scorpio, and Atu XIII, Death. J = 50, linking it to the \"50 Gates of Binah.\" 4. And still I go on, struggling with the blac�ness. Now there is an earthqua�e. The veil is torn into thousands of pieces that go fly­ing away in a whirling wind. And there is an all-glorious Angel before me, standing in the sign of Apophis and Typhon.

Compare The Apocalypse, especially 6:12-1 The Cross, symbolizing incarnation, represents the mortal life of the aspirant. The Rose discloses the nature of the same being's immortal spiritual essence. The Adept, who mediates between the heights and the depths, forges a union between these extremes in the fused symbol of their coition. Therefore, the Cross (particularly the cross of the four Elements) provides the primary formula of attainment of the \"Man of Earth,\" or aspirant to adepthood; the Rose portrays the unfolding nature of the \"Hermit\" or Master; and the Rosy Cross, their union, is ensign of the central formula of the \"Lover\" or Adept. years earlier: pending annihi.,. forehead is Aju..,, !ows is sym�� mstructs acco� allegorical m� ' 6.

There is a further related passage, from the Rose-Croix Masonic ritual, through which Crowley had passed years earlier: It is the hour when the veil of the Temple was rent in twain and darkness overspread the earth, when the true Light departed from us, the Altar was thrown down, the Blazing Star was eclipsed, the cubic Stone poured forth Blood and Water, the Word was lost, and despair and tribulation sat heavily upon us. The angel appears both in this preamble, and as the central figure of the second part of the vision. He stands in the sign of Typhon­Apophis, one of four signs attributed to the 5°=6° Grade and to Tiphereth (arms raised upward, separated at an angle of 60°, the head thrown back). It is a sign of destruction. It foreshadows the pending annihilation and desolation of the Adept. The star on his forehead is Ajna, opened like the Eye of Shiva; for what now fol­lows is symbolized by Night, N.O.X., not Light, L.V.X .. The angel instructs accordingly, with words that have at once both literal and allegorical meanings. 6. Therefore I withdraw myself. (Thus far the vision upon Da'leh Addin, a mountain in the desert near Bou-Saada.) Crowley withdrew from the vision as instructed. In Chapter 66 of his Confessions, he recorded what he did for the six and a half hours intervening before he again invoked the rethyr that evening: I must explain that we had climbed Da'leh Addin, a mountain in the desert, as enjoined by the Angel during the previous night. I now withdrew from the .t'Ethyr and prepared to return to the city. Suddenly came the command to perform a magical ceremony on the summit. We accordingly took loose rocks and built a great cir­cle, inscribed with the words of power; and in the midst we erect­ed an altar and there I sacrificed myself. The fire of the all-seeing sun smote down upon the altar, consuming utterly every particle of my personality. I am obliged to write in hieroglyph of this mat­ter, because it concerns things of which it is unlawful to speak openly under penalty of the most dreadful punishment; 1 but I may say that the essence of the matter was that I had hitherto clung to 1 He meant this literally. In England, in 1909, sodomy was illegal. It bore \"the most dreadful punishment.\" As mentioned previously, Oscar Wilde's impact on Crowley had not been slight!

It is Crowley's own planets that most dominate the angles of the hour. As shown in his natal horoscope in Appendix E, he was born with an exact Saturn-Uranus opposition in partile aspect to his Sun. As this vision began, his Uranus was rising and his Saturn was setting. (This is the only actual Saturn influence asso­ciated with this very Saturnian vision, other than the Capricorn symbolism of the U in UTA.) His Mercury was also angular, on the IC, in paranatellon1 to his Saturn and Uranus. This trio de­scribes rather well this vision wherein his intellect is debased to liberate his higher perception's assimilation of the stark, unbuff­ered nature of reality. The Moon remained in Leo in the Sidereal Zodiac, but had now entered Virgo in the Tropical. This one time, among all the visions thus far examined, a better argument can be made for the Tropical Moon than for the Sidereal.

In any case, the ardent, fiery, solar, egoic Leo energies of the Moon's Si­dereal placement are starkly absent in this vision. The Angel re-appears. 7. The blacRness gathers about, so thicR, so clinging, so penetrat­ing, so oppressive, that all the other darRness that I have ever conceived would be liRe bright light beside it. Profound blackness is a constant symbol throughout this vision. It is the \"thick darkness\" meant by the Hebrew word, �:::>�, ophel, and the \"thick darkness its swaddling band\" of Job 38:9, attributed by Qabalists to the letter Heh, i1, and to Binah, the Mother. 8. His voice comes in a whisper: 0 thou that art master of the fifty gates of Understanding, is not my mother a blacR woman? 0 thou that art master of the Pentagram, is not the egg of spirit a blacR egg? Here abideth terror, and the blind ache of the Soul, and lo! even I, who am the sole light, a sparR shut up, stand in the sign of Apophis and Typhon. 9.

The angel reminds Crowley that, in symbols by which the aspirant seeks adepthood, and by which the Adept moves toward mastery, black is the color of the highest. 1 A black object has unresisting­ly absorbed all light, and thus may signify the holiest. The angel then identifies himself with Hadit, the \"sole light,\" essential \"spark,\" or point of view, of each being. He further identifies him­self with Chaos (Xaoc; ), a name referred to Chokmah, representing the unformed potential that precedes the formulations of Saturn in Binah. He stands in the Sign of Typhon-Apophis as before, invok-1 See Prologue 1, \"Ebon Sea of the Unknown.\""},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"288 Visions & Voices ing the destruction, desolation, and annihilation that liberate. His last phrase is a restatement of the writings of St. John of the Cross. 10. The egg of the spirit is a basilisb egg, and the gates of the un­derstanding are fifty, that is the sign of the Scorpion. The pillars about the neophyte are crowned with flame, and the vault of the Adepts is lighted by the Rose. And in the abyss is the eye of the hawb. But upon the great sea shall the Master of the Temple find neither star nor moon. A basilisk (lit., \"little king\") is a mythic serpent with a lethal glance. Crowley attributed it to Geburah. The meaning here is that the Quintessence attained in the equilibration of the elements opens a slaying eye, the Eye of Shiva; and that the waters ofBinah are waters of death. Then follow symbols of initiations Crowley had previously undergone wherein symbols of Light marked his way, and drew his attention upward: the lamps atop the pillars of his Neophyte (0=0) initiation in the Golden Dawn, and the brilliant rose that illuminated the ceiling of the Vault of the Adepts in his initiation to that Order's 5=6 Grade. Later, he came to know the Eye of Horus staring back at him from the profound of the Abyss. Yet here, in Binah, upon the Great Sea, there was no such light to be found; for the supernal consciousness is that of a Night which exceeds the Adept's brightest Light, even as vacuous space greets the pilgrim who ventures beyond the greatest heights of Earth's atmosphere. 11. And I was about to answer him: \"The light is within me.\" But before I could frame the words, he answered me with the great word that is the Key of the Abyss. And he said: Thou hast entered the night; dost thou yet lust for day? Sorrow is my name, and af­fliction. I am girt about with tribulation.

The \"word that is the Key of the Abyss\" is N.O.X. (See 210 in Appendix A.) The angel described this Night, which Crowley then invoked (a voluntary act of embracing the Abyss). It engulfed him. 12. What I thought were shapes of rocbs, rather felt than seen, now appear to be veiled Masters, sitting absolutely still and silent. Nor can any one be distinguished from the others. 13. And the Angel sayeth: Behold where thine Angel hath led thee! Thou didst asb fame, power and pleasure, health and wealth and love, and strength, and length of days. Thou didst hold life with eight tentacles, libe an octopus. Thou didst seeb the four powers and the seven delights and the twelve emancipa­tions and the two and twenty Privileges and the nine and forty Manifestations, and lo! thou art become as one of These. Bowed are their bacbs, whereon resteth the universe. Veiled are their faces, that have beheld the glory Ineffable. 14. These adepts seem libe Pyramids - their hoods and robes are libe Pyramids. In the darkness, the seated Masters of the Temple (seen in the tra­ditional black hooded robe of the A:.A:.), appear like black pyr­amids. They are without movement or sound (i.e., without vibra­tion). They are without ego-distinctions. They are still. These three paragraphs concentrate the particular stark reality that it was most necessary that Crowley see and understand to ef­fect his initiation to this Grade. The \"glory Ineffable\" that they have beheld is 11:::1::>, kavod, a word technically related to Kether. 15. And the Angel sayeth: Verily is the Pyramid a Temple of Initi­ation. Verily also is it a tomb. Thinbest thou that there is life with­in the Masters of the Temple, that sit hooded, encamped upon the Sea? Verily, there is no life in them. The Greek nupaf.w;, \"pyramid,\" enumerates to 831, as does <jlaA­AOs, \"phallus.\" The same number is the value of eavaTou, \"of death.\" Crowley synthesized all of these meanings when he wrote of the pyramid that, \"It is also a Phallus which dies itself to com­municate Life to others.\""},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"290 Visions & Voices In the Golden Dawn rituals, as in the A:.A:. Neophyte cere­mony, the term \"pyramid\" sometimes is used to mean a three­sided pyramidal structure (with a fourth surface for its base), properly called a tetrahedron. Formed entirely of Fire triangles, it is regarded as a symbol of the letter Shin, 'tV. Shin is a symbol of Neshamah, or super-consciousness, and is an appropriate symbol of this Grade for that reason as well. 16. Their sandals were the pure light, and they have tal:?en them from their feet and cast them down through the abyss, for this JEthyr is holy ground. An Egyptian sandal strap is in the form of an ankh, the familiar hi­eroglyph for \"life.\" Thus, it is their ankhs -their life force, com­prised of \"light\" - that the Masters have cast down into the realm of Ruach, or normal human consciousness. The Masters shod themselves in Light, that their feet might never touch anything ex­cept Light, until reaching this \"holy ground\" of Binah, to which is attributed the Sekhel ha-Qadosh, or SanctifYing Consciousness. 17. Herein no forms appear, and the vision of Cod face to face, that is transmuted in the Athanor called dissolution, or ham­mered into one in the forge of meditation, is in this place but a blasphemy and a mocl:?ery. \"The Vision of God face-to-face\" is normally attributed to Chok­mah. The reference here must be to its shadow, cast into the Ruach and perceived by Crowley at an earlier stage, perhaps as one of the projections forged in the service of the Knowledge and Conversa­tion of his Holy Guardian Angel. 18. And the Beatific Vision is no more, and the glory of the Most High is no more. There is no more l:?nowledge. There is no more bliss. There is no more power. There is no more beauty.

The eye is called seventy, and the triple Aleph whereby thou perceivest it, divideth into the number of the terri­ble word that is the Key of the Abyss. The attributes of Binah are dark, bitter, and deadly. They replace the Wine of Bliss. Also, salt has a strong relationship to Binah (a) as the salt sea, (fJ) as Binah is the Root of Alchemical Salt among the Supemals, and ( y) due to the cubical formation of salt crystals, a trait they share with crystals of Saturn's metal, lead. Understand­ing, Wisdom, and Being, the three supernal sephiroth, are ex­plained, though the secret characteristic of Chokmah was veiled from him.2 The numerical mystery implied is this: \"The eye\" is A'ayin, lJ, 70. The \"triple Aleph\" is the full spelling �?� = 111 times 3, or 333 (= Choronzon). 70 + 333 = .210, implying 210 = N.O.X., \"the terrible word that is the Key of the Abyss.\" In his personal gri­moire, soon after receiving these visions, Crowley wrote further: Note 210 = 7 x 6 x 5 & .210 = 70/333 = 3J/3x�.

Note that, as this vision neared its end, the conjoined Sun and Mercury approached the IC. Mercury and the Sun are the \"Her­mes\" and \"Father\" of this paragraph. The Masters are then described as in the deepest meditation, their awareness withdrawn entirely from the outer sensory, chan­nels of sight, hearing, &c. 22. And that bright light of comfort, and that piercing sword of truth, and all that power and beauty that they have made of themselves, is cast from them, as it is written, \"I saw Satan lil?e lightning fall from Heaven.\" And as a flaming sword is it dropt through the abyss, where the four beasts beep watch and ward.

Their adepthood is shed, along with the \"tendencies\" (or Briatic projections, sankharas) which defined their distinctive humanity. Being forged from duality, these do not surpass the Abyss; but they do once more coalesce below the Abyss, \"so that they can function as an Exempt Adept,\" as Crowley wrote, \"But their per­manent function is in the grade to which their 'center of gravity' (so to speak) tends.\" That is, though the Master remains \"above the Abyss,\" the con­struct that is the Adept (that the Master was) is \"thrown back\" from the Abyss into that sphere of life most expressive of the Adept's underlying nature and the life work arising therefrom. Note that the \"four beasts,\" the Kerubim, are designated as the wardens, or guardians, of the Abyss; i.e., they guard the admission to the Third Order, even as they have warded the 32nd Path ofTav, n, and the admission to the Vault of the Adepti in earlier stages.

A prediction at the end of the paragraph is worth noting. The last two sentences link 50, the value of the letter Nun, J, with 106, the value of the word Nun, 11:1, and then with the idea of Death, the Tarot trump to which Nun is attributed. The penultimate sen­tence can be read that the term of Crowley's \"understanding\" (his time as an 8°=3°, or initiate ofBinah, \"Understanding\") would be 106 \"seasons.\" Crowley, in hindsight, claimed that if these are taken as lunar months, it is exactly so. Evidently, he did not meas­ure the 106 months from this December 1909 initiation, and he surely meant calendar months instead of lunar months: Since the date of his initiation to the 9°=2° Grade was October 1915, and 106 months is 8 years + 10 months, he was measuring from De­cember 1906, the month that he and Fra. D.D.S. (George Cecil Jones) were first confirmed as 8°=3°. Crowley denied the Grade at the time, but in retrospect seems to have found it convenient to measure his attainment from that date. 23. During all this speech, the figure of the Angel has dwindled and flicRered, and now it is gone out. In the thick darkness of this vision, the angel has been \"the sole light.\" Now, in a closure lending dramatic poignancy to the vision, this, too, dwindles to a single point and then blinks out.

Therefore, the angles are similar, but with Uranus and Neptune now approaching the meridian rather than receding from it. Venus, on the Zenith, is also prominent for this more Edenic vision (and crosses the Midheaven as the vision progresses). Crowley's natal Venus was setting, perhaps helping set the tone for its beauty and harmony. What is quite different, though, is that Saturn conjoined the Eastpoint at the beginning; and, though less visible at a glance, Saturn is only 3 o above the Ascendant. (It is actually the most an­gular planet.) This seems strange at first, since this vision seems far less Saturnian than the two before it. The difference is that Sat­urn themes in this present vision express more the flavor of the su­pernal Binah than of the more material Tav. Even if we set astrology aside, this vision has powerful Binah associations.

The rainbow is a common symbol of the Sagittarian path on the Tree of Life (present in nearly every ver­sion of Atu XIV; or there is an iris, named after the Roman god­dess of the rainbow). He is golden, backlit by golden light, and walking on golden waters, because he is the emissary of Tiphereth. Yet the Angel is most assuredly an emissary of Binah as well -or, at least, of the powers of Water. The reference to the 33 thun­ders comes from the 4th Enochian Call, which invokes Water: I have set my feet in the south, and have looked about me, saying: are not the thunders of increase numbered 33, which reign in the second angle? (The \"second angle\" is the Water tablet, or Great Watchtower of the West.) Given the syntax of Enochian numeration, this \"33\" is probably read as \"three, three,\" rather than \"thirty-three\"; it there­fore especially refers to Binah as the Root of Water. 1 3. All the Aire behind him is gold, but it opens as it were a veil. There are two terrible bloc!:? giants, wrestling in mortal hatred. And there is a little bird upon a bush, and the bird flaps its wings. Thereat the strength of the giants snaps, and they fall in heaps to the earth, as though all their bones were suddenly brol:?en. Crowley explained this paragraph as \"a parable of the illusion of matter, whose vast horror is destroyed by the moving of the wings of initiation.\" This paragraph also contains the transition imagery we have come to expect in these visions, the pulling back of the veil of Y etzirah to grant access to the deeper Briatic message. 4. And now waves of light roll through the JEthyr, as if they were playing. Therefore suddenly I am in a garden, upon a terrace of a great castle, that is upon a rocl:?y mountain.

The beauty of this vision is quite moving. Waves of golden light roll through the rethyr playfully, across the waters, about the Angel - and the scene begins to change. Crowley identified the setting as resembling the Alhambra, a beautiful Moorish palace in Granada, Spain. Like a setting drawn from subconsciousness in a dream, the location may not be particularly relevant per se. More significant­ly, this paragraph begins the instruction regarding a Master's gar­den, the personal Eden over which he or she is given to preside. The images should be brought clearly to the reader's imagination and allowed to dance there, to appreciate something of the real feel of this visionary experience. 5. A voice comes: This water which thou seest is called the water of death. But NEMO hath filled therefrom our springs. As Uranus and Neptune reached the Midheaven, the formal in­struction of the rethyr began. Everything Crowley was shown was formed from \"the water of death.\" So beautiful, sunlit, and happy a scene confirms that the meaning of this phrase is not the conventional one most people might first suspect on hearing it. Perhaps the best expression of what it does mean can be found in the text of The 32 Paths ofWis­dom attributed to the letter Nun, J, 50, Death: It is called the Imaginative Consciousness, because it provides an Image to all created things that have an appearance, in a Form fit­ting to each. \"Imaginative\" is dimyoni, 'J1'7J1, from the root i17J1, \"to imagine, think, meditate, remember.\" These words describe the processes that the Master employs in \"filling the springs\" from which the garden blossoms forth and lives. An identically spelled root means \"to be silent, to be quiet, to rest, to cease,\" from which is derived the meaning, \"to perish.\" The main idea is this: There is something that perseveres, with­out interruption, flowing eternally and assuming one image or form after another, seeking that particular form most fitting to its own nature."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"It so varied, and lu­t seems li�e a great I lws of golden light r � about the Angel ilified the setting as fpdace in Granada, � in a dream, the tore significant-a Master's gar-r.. \"d �-given to pres1 e. lf-ter's imagination �g of the real feel � � is called the water twsprings. i.en. the formal in­� II' from \"the water of lfl= confirms that the one most people best expression of t 32 Paths of Wis-• ,� ' lluse it provides an J.ce. in a Form fit­�-� ilr.l1, \"to imagine, �be the processes ' from which the spelled root means which is derived � perseveres, with­�g one image or Jinn most fitting to its F 6. And I said: Who is NEMO? The Cry of the 131h lEthyr ZIM 299 7. And the voice answered: A dolphin's tooth, and a ram's horns, and the hand of a man that is hanged, and the phallus of a goat. (By this I understand that nun is explained by shin, and he by resh, and mem by yod, and ayin by tau. NEMO is therefore called 165 = 11 x 15; and is in himself 910 = 91 Amen x 10; and 13 x 70 = The One Eye, Achad Ayin.) Nemo is a Latin word meaning \"nobody.\" It is a generic name for those who have crossed the Abyss and gained admission to the City of Pyramids (Binah), losing themselves in the process.1 In Latin, NEMO enumerates to 41 as do AMOR, \"love,\" FIDES, \"faith\" (a technical term referring to Binah, \"the parent of faith\"), and the name BABALON. However, we are here given a Hebrew spelling, and a Qabalistic code to explain it. The spelling of Nemo encoded into §7 is lJI'.Jill This enumer­ates to 165. (In Greek, N q.to has the same value, which it shares with such words as allo8£v, \"from the sea,\" referring to the Great Sea of Binah.) Pause a moment to consider the astrological corre­spondences of these four Hebrew letters: Scorpio, Aquarius, Wa­ter, Capricorn. We have already seen, many times, how Nun, J, Scorpio, 50, Death is an important symbol of this Binah initiation, serving nearly as a monogram thereof. The remaining letters are that for Water (the element of Binah, the Mother, or Great Sea) flanked by the letters of the two zodiacal signs ruled by Saturn, Aquarius and Capricorn. The name is a nearly perfect talisman of all the letters describing this initiation of Binah, only the letter of Saturn herself, Tav, n, being missing. Tav is included, however, in another tetragram given in the text as commentary on the name. These letters - represented by the words tooth, horn (implying head), a hanged man, and a phallus­are Shin Resh Yod Tav, n�1ID. They enumerate to 910. Crowley focused on analyzing this number (in passages of the vision text that were added to §7 after the fact, in his handwriting rather than Neuburg's), but seems to have missed the fact that n�1ID is an ac­tual Hebrew word. Pronounced sarayath, it means, \"you have 1 This idea may be applied to mystical or religious texts that refer to \"no man,\" like the verse, \"The night cometh wherein no man shall labor.\" Beneath its sur­face meaning, this also may be understood as: the Night (N.O.X.) of Pan ap­proaches wherein Nemo, the Master of the Temple, shall labor."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"300 Visions & Voices striven.\" It was used in Genesis 32:29 in one of the most important passages in the history of the Hebrew people and their religion, when Jacob, having striven with his angel, was given the new name Isrrel, \"one who has prevailed with God,\" a name he trans­mitted to all his descendants: And he said, 'No more shall your name be called Jacob, but Isrrel (1?l'nlV'): for you have striven (n'1lV) with Elohim and with men, and have overcome. I have quoted this in some detail because other elements of the Ja­cob story appear in the paragraphs following. This is not an isolat­ed reference. The Jacob legend is somehow closely tied to the leg­end ofNemo. The exact connection is not completely evident, but I will give the parts, that others may dig deeper into it for them­selves: Rearranging the letters of n'1'tV gives n'ID1, rashith, \"be­ginning.\" A further clue is another word enumerating to 910, 1:m1?1n?, le-thol'dotham, meaning \"according to their genera­tions.\" (See Genesis 10:32.) 8. And now there cometh an Angel into the garden, but he hath not any of the attributes of the former Angels, for he is libe a young man, dressed in white linen robes. 9. And he saith: No man hath beheld the face of my Father. Therefore he that hath beheld it is called NEMO. And bnow thou that every man that is called NEMO hath a garden that he tendeth. And every garden that is and flourisheth hath been prepared from the desert by NEMO, watered with the waters that were called death. The Divine Name of Binah is Tetragrammaton Elohim, l:l'il?� i11i1'. This is also the divinity Who kept an eye on the Garden of Eden. It is the only Divine Name in Genesis during the time that Adam and Eve resided in the garden. Thus is it written, \"Every man that is called NEMO hath a garden.\" This garden is the field of manifestation of the distinctive Work of the Master, expressed especially as the Master's disciples. (The Latin word neophytus, \"neophyte,\" literally means \"new plant.\") The diversity of such gardens is endless. Most of the instruction in this vision concerns how the Master tends such a garden. We are told that every \"garden\" of any kind that has ever flour­ished has been brought forth \"from the desert\" by a Master of the Temple.

Much is contained in this one idea, and should be sought out by every student by attentive contemplation. 10. And I say unto him: To what end is the garden prepared? 11. And he saith: First for the beauty and delight thereof; and next because it is written, \"And Tetragrammaton Elohim planted a garden eastward in Eden.\" And lastly, because though every flower bringeth forth a maiden, yet is there one flower that shall bring forth a man-child. And his name shall be called NEMO, when he beholdeth the face of my Father. And he that tendeth the garden seel:?eth not to single out the flower that shall be NEMO. He doeth naught but tend the garden. The metaphor of the \"male child\" should be understood according to the rules of primogeniture. Though sexist by modem standards, it communicates a basic idea in a language that was deeply in­grained in Crowley, his culture, and probably his cells. By \"male child,\" I think we need understand nothing more than \"successor,\" or \"one who shall inherit.\" It is the original Rosicrucian doctrine \"that every member should look for a worthy person who, after his decease, might succeed him.\" The difference is that the Rosicru­cian (that is, the Adept, or member ofthe true Order R:.C:.) was to actively seek one out. The Master of the Temple, on the other hand, is being instructed to work without attachment to the results and without seeking, with peaceful certainty of the success. 12. And I said: Pleasant indeed is the garden, and light is the toil of tending it, and great is the reward. 13. And he said: Bethinl:? thee that NEMO hath beheld the face of my Father. In Him is only Peace. This is another reference to the Jacob story. Jacob named the site of his ordeal Peniel (?�'J:::l, lit. \"the face of God\"), \"for I have seen God face to face.\" 14. And I said: Are all gardens lil:?e unto this garden? 15. And he waved his hand, and in the Aire across the valley appeared an island of coral, rosy, with green palms and fruit­trees, in the midst of the bluest of the seas. 16. And he waved his hand again, and there appeared a val­ley shut in by mighty snow mountains, and in it were pleasant"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"302 Visions & Voices streams of water, rushing through, and broad rivers, and lobes covered with lilies. 17. And he waved his hand again, and there was a vision, as it were of an oasis in the desert. 18. And again he waved his hand, and there was a dim coun­try with grey rocbs, and heather, and gorse, and bracben. 19. And he waved his hand yet again, and there was a parb, and a small house therein, surrounded by yews. This time the house opens, and I see in it an old man, sitting by the table. He is blind. Yet he writeth in a great boob, constantly. I see what he is writing: \"The words of the Boob are as the leaves of the flowers in the garden. Many indeed of these my songs shall go forth as maidens, but there is one among them, which one I bnow not, that shall be a man-child, whose name shall be NEMO, when he hath beheld the face of the Father, and become blind.\" Other gardens are shown. The specifics are perhaps of no great significance. Crowley identified these as being in the Pacific Ocean ( § 15), Kashmir ( § 16), the Sahara ( § 17), and Scotland (§§18-19). 20. (All this vision is most extraordinarily pleasant and peaceful, entirely without strength or ecstasy, or any positive quality, but equally free from the opposites of any of those qualities.) And the young man seems to read my thought, which is, that I should love to stay in this garden and do nothing for ever; for he sayeth to me: Come with me, and behold how NEMO tendeth his gar­den. At about this juncture - in the midst of these visions \"most ex­traordinarily pleasant and peaceful\" - Venus was crossing the Midheaven, adding her peaceful, pleasant energies to the mix. 21. So we enter the earth, and there is a veiled figure, in absolute darbness. Yet it is perfectly possible to see in it, so that the minut­est details do not escape us.

The reader likely can examine the metaphors and symbols perfectly fine on his or her own, so I will only highlight a few points. The work is performed \"in absolute darkness\" - an idea that has been discussed previously - but a lucid darkness. The work is undertaken on the roots of each plant. Each plant requires a different kind of care, which often, outwardly, appears hurtful, but is, in fact, the exact thing that it needs. (These are the or­deals. This metaphor should not be interpreted as giving the occult teacher license to effect cruelties.) This mode of care is the truest compassion, the providing to each thing that which it specifically needs. As it is written, This also is compassion: an end to the sickness of earth. A root­ing-out of the weeds: a watering of the flowers. 0 my children, ye are more beautiful than the flowers: ye must not fade in your sea­son. (Liber Tzaddi, vv. 26-27) 22. And I said: Heavy is the labour, but great indeed is the re­ward. 23. And the young man answered me: He shall not see the re-ward, he tendeth the garden. He is without lust of result. He works without attachment. He per­forms his role, fulfilling his function, and entrusts the development of its fruits - of later generations - to the hands of Eternity. 24. And I said: What shall come unto him? 25. And he said: This thou canst not Rnow, nor is it revealed by the letters that are the totems of the stars, but only by the stars. Again, the reference is to the Mystery of 9°=2° first mentioned in the vision of the 15th .tEthyr. 26. And he says to me, quite disconnectedly: The man of earth is the adherent. The lover giveth his life unto the worR among men . The hermit goeth solitary, and giveth only of his light unto men. \"The man of earth is the adherent. The lover giveth his life unto the work among men. The hermit goeth solitary, and giveth only of his light unto men.\" This is one of the most important and use­ful passages in all of these visions, so I repeat it in full. It is an ex­planation of Liber Legis 1 :40, which distinguishes \"Three Grades, the Hermit, and the Lover, and the man of Earth.\""},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"304 Visions & Voices 27. And I asb him: Why does he tell me that? 28. And he says: I tell thee not. Thou tellest thyself, for thou hast pondered thereupon for many days, and hast not found light. And now that thou art called NEMO, the answer to every riddle that thou hast not found shall spring up in thy mind, unsought. Who can tell upon what day a flower shall bloom? The power of direct knowing was his. I am troubled by this passage. It unambiguously links this pow­er to the 8°=3° Grade; but, in most cases, a fairly advanced Neo­phyte 1 °= 10° already will possess it, any answer that is truly needed coming spontaneously into the mind. It seems a disservice to imply that this capacity is linked only to so distant a goal as the Mastery. Only the word \"unsought\" distinguishes what is said here from what we routinely have seen among mature A:.A:. Neo­phytes. (The phenomenon usually observed is that any necessary question asked will at once produce its answer upon the clear for­mulation of the question.) 29. And thou shalt give thy wisdom unto the world, and that shall be thy garden. And concerning time and death, thou hast naught to do with these things. For though a precious stone be hidden in the sand of the desert, it shall not heed for the wind of the desert, although it be but sand. For the worber of worbs hath worbed thereupon; and because it is clear, it is invisible; and be­cause it is hard, it moveth not. Crowley was given the definition of his own Work, the perimeter of his garden. This is expressed in terms of Wisdom, as if to say that it is a work of Chokmah and the Grade of Magus at which he was most to toil. The remainder of the paragraph is a quite beauti­ful metaphor \"concerning time and death\" that yields much fruit when taken into meditation. 30. All these words are heard by everyone that is called NEMO. And with that doth he apply himself to understanding. And he must understand the virtue of the waters of death, and he must understand the virtue of the sun and the wind, and of the worm that turneth the earth, and of the stars that roof in the garden. And he must understand the separate nature and property of every flower, or how shall he tend his garden? These in.structiollll The five eletnelllll 31.

And I said to him: Concerning the Vision and the Voice, I would �now if these things be of the essence of the IEthyr, or of the essence of the seer. 32. And he answers: It is of the essence of him that is called NEMO, combined with the essence of the IEthyr, for from the 1st IEthyr to the 15th IEthyr, there is no vision and no voice, save for him that is called NEMO. And he that see�eth the vision and the voice therein is led away by dog-faced demons that show no sign of truth, seducing from the Sacred Mysteries, unless his name be NEMO. These 30 visions, he is told, partake partly of his essence, and part­ly of the inherent nature of the <ethyrs. This matches what we have seen in astrological and Qabalistic analysis. The beauty of the as­trological method is that we often have a means of differentiating these things from each other. He is told also that, beginning with the 151h JEthyr, only one who is Nemo will get a correct vision. Others may certainly get visions - but they will be such as to lead them astray, and perhaps even away from the mysteria altogether. They will not be understood aright. 33. And hadst thou not been fitted, thou too hadst been led away, for before the gate of the 15th IEthyr, is this written: He shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie. And again it is written: The Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart. And again it is written that Cod tempteth man. But thou hadst the word and the sign, and thou hadst authority from thy superior, and licence. And thou hast done well in that thou didst not dare, and in that thou dost dare. For daring is not presumption. Crowley is reminded that he has not only such details as the Word and Sign of the 8°=3° Grade (their inner meanings), but also had been vested with the Grade three years earlier, through his superi­or in the A:.A:., George Cecil Jones (G:.H:. Frater D.D.S.). Then a final, useful teaching: \"Daring is not presumption.\" Even a Neophyte can benefit from learning this distinction!"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"306 Visions & Voices 34.

They give a formal gesture on departure, including the Sign of the 8°=3° Grade, which is the Sign of Mater Triumphans or Isis Re­joicing: feet together, the left arm curved as if to support an infant, and the thumb and index finger of the right hand pinching the nip­ple of the left breast as if offering it.

Of the various factors characterizing this vision, the Can­cer/Cheth influence stems from the name LOE itself. There are al­so astrological indicators, of which the foremost is the rising of the Moon, the planet ruling Cancer. In particular, this Moon is waning, just past her Last Quarter: she is the \"waning Moon\" that §3 says is the chariot. Luna squares the Sun and Mercury, which are close to the IC (in fact, they are in close paran); but it is Luna herself that dominates the horoscope from her rising place, even as it is the goddess Babalon and her cup (both lunar symbols, in the most general sense) that dominate the vision. Even more strikingly, this slightly crescent Moon rose in the east, cup-like, in the midst of the stars of Leo, almost exactly at the point of the vision - approximately §§8-10 - that Crowley wit­nessed Babalon emerging riding upon the leonine Beast. (See Atu XI, Lust.) Crescent Moon in Sidereal Leo describes the vision ra­ther well. On the other hand, there is very little indication of the symbolism of the Moon's Tropical sign, Virgo. LOE or :CL.i = Cancer, Libra, Virgo. It enumerates to 30 + 70 + 8 = 108. This produces various words that express the oppos-ing poles of Babala.

Cancer corre­sponds to the L of LOE. The other letters have a broader, more general impact, which is sequential as the vision proceeds. Thus, after beginning with the chariot for L, it next moves to \"Babalon the Beautiful\" for Libra (0), and then to the mysteries of paternity on one hand, and the isolated \"Dark Brothers,\" on the other hand, for Virgo (E). In addition, Cancer, Libra, and Virgo all may be un­derstood as goddess symbols, referring to Babalon. Less clear is the symbolism of Chokmah of Briah. Mostly it is not present, other than the allusions to paternity near the middle of the vision. Even these are minor, compared to the power of the feminine images. The explanation is found in § 14, which infers that the Mystery of Paternity would have been made clearer had Crowley then been a Magus (an initiate of Chokmah) rather than a Magister who was so \"new-born unto Understanding.\" As I examine the three visions next before us (12th through lOth), Crowley's momentum toward the Abyss overwhelms nearly all other considerations. A process had been set in motion that, at times, supersedes anything else occurring. Certainly, no opportuni­ty was lost in this present vision to provide him with the wisdom­teachings that would prepare him for his right advancement unto Binah, the sphere ofUnderstanding. 1. There appear in the stone two pillars of flame, and in the midst is a chariot of white fire. This paragraph introduces the Mystery of The Chariot, as men­tioned previously. It is a Vision of Cancer, Cheth, n, and the letter Lin LOE. Crowley and his collaborator, Frieda Harris adapted this imagery 30 years later in designing Atu VII of the Thoth deck. Cheth represents the central task of the Adeptus Exemptus 7°=4° in his advance to Binah 8°=3°. Doctrines of this path were detailed nearly a year later when Crowley received the Thelemic Holy Book Liber Cheth (see Appendix C), of which he wrote,"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"310 Visions & Voices \"This book is a perfect account of the task of the Exempt Adept, considered under the symbols of a particular plane, not the intel­lectual.\" It is to this that Crowley referred when he wrote, in his essay One Star in Sight, that the Exempt Adept \"must perform ... the consecration of himself as a pure vehicle for the influence of the order to which he aspires.\"' For some interesting similarities, these verses can be compared to the first chapter of Ezekiel. 2. This seems to be the chariot of the Seventh Key of the Tarot. However, it is drawn by four sphinxes, diverse, lil?e the four sphinxes upon the door of the vault of the adepts, counter­changed in their component parts. See Atu VII of the Thoth deck for one artistic interpretation of the images of these four sphinxes. While each Kerub is in the image of one of the four Holy Living Creatures (classically, the Bull, Li­on, Man, and Eagle) they are composited so that each partakes of a portion of the other. This is the doctrine of the 16 sub-elements. The language alludes to symbols employed in the 5=6 initiation ceremony of the old Order wherein designs representing these el­emental counter-charges were placed about the Enochian ele­mental tablets on the door of the Vault of the Adepti. (See the plate on the next page.) Their greatest mystical relevance is buried within an admonition that Crowley received when he first beheld them during his 5=6 initiation: \"Forget not that the Tablets and Kerubim are the guardians of the Vault of the Adepts.\" 3. The chariot itself is the lunar crescent, waning. The canopy is supported by eight pillars of amber. These pillars are upright, and yet the canopy, which they support, is the whole vault of night. Cancer is ruled by the Moon, which was actually waning at this time. More importantly, the L in LOE corresponds to the waning Moon aspect of Cancer (in contrast to the Enochian P, which is the waxing Moon). Cheth, n, enumerates to eight, and corresponds to the color amber. These eight pillars refer to many mysteries of re­generation and attainment as dramatized in rituals of several magi­cal orders.

The charioteer is a man in golden armour, studded with sap­phires, but over his shoulders is a white robe, and over that a red robe. Upon his golden helmet he beareth for his crest a crab.

The gold is of the Sun. Sapphires are attributed to Jupiter, but also are the color of Gimel, l, the Moon: The Moon rules, and Jupiter is exalted in, Cancer.

It is the blood of the \"saints\" - the Adepts of Thelema, who have enjoyed the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel and the depth of the love thereof -whose blood, or life, or consciousness is spilled wholly into this vessel.

Each Adept must ask what it is into which he or she would pour the whole of their life, without reservation or hesita­tion. That it is called \"wine\" refers not only to its intoxicating properties, but also to the fact that it will have fermented (§7) and aged slowly, no bottle to be opened before its time; that each ex­ample is a distinctive vintage of a distinctive harvest; and that it is the essence of the sacrament. Notice that Crowley still did not know the correct spelling of the name Babalon. He heard it, rather than seeing it, and took it to be \"Babylon.\" The angel equated Her with the Scarlet Woman of Liber Legis. This is also a statement of the equivalency of the \"scarlet woman\" of The Apocalypse to \"the whore of Babylon\" -rightly, \"the whore Babalon.\" (Babalon is the Enochian word for \"harlot.\") The symbolism of the last sentence of §6 speaks for it­self in one sense, and is almost impenetrable in another. One might say that ecstasy releases what is poured forth freely, as dis­cussed in the prior paragraph. 7. With the breath of her Risses hath she fermented it, and it hath become the wine of the Sacrament, the wine of the Sabbath; and in the Holy Assembly hath she poured it out for her worship­pers, and they have become drunRen thereon, so that face to face have they beheld my Father. Thus are they made worthy to become partaRers of the Mystery of this holy vessel, for the blood is the life. So sitteth she from age to age, and the righteous are never weary of her Risses, and by her murders and fornications she seduceth the world. Therein is manifested the glory of my Fa­ther, who is truth. 8. (This wine is such that its virtue radiateth through the cup, and I reel under the intoxication of it. And every thought is de­stroyed by it. It abideth alone, and its name is Compassion. I un­derstand by 'Compassion,' the sacrament of suffering, partaRen of by the true worshippers of the Highest. And it is an ecstasy in which there is no trace of pain. Its passivity ( = passion) is liRe the giving-up of the self to the beloved.) A mystery of Binah and, in a lesser sense, the central sacrament of Chesed. What is said here of Babalon is true of Neshamah.

This is that which is written, \"0 my Cod, in one last rapture let me attain to the union with the many.\" For she is Love, and her love is one, and she hath divided the one love into infinite loves, and each love is one, and equal with The One, and therefore is she passed \"from the assembly and the law and the enlighten­ment unto the anarchy of solitude and darl:?ness.

He identifies Babalon with love itself, which shines in part through every love we have. I think this verse is best understood in context of v. 42 following it, \"In the silence of Things, in the Night of Forces, beyond the accursed domain of the Three, let us enjoy our love!\" The second quote, then, is based on vv. 43-44. 12. 0 Babylon, Babylon, thou mighty Mother, that ridest upon the crowned beast, let me be drunRen upon the wine of thy for­nications; let thy Risses wanton me unto death, that even I, thy cup-bearer, may understand 13. Now, through the ruddy glow of the cup, I may perceive far above, and infinitely great, the vision of Babylon. And the Beast whereon she rideth is the Lord of the City of the Pyramids, that I beheld in the fourteenth JEthyr. \"Mighty Mother\" was applied to the goddess Isis in the 5=6 ritual of the old R.R. et A. C., through which Crowley had passed years earlier. A correspondence seems implied between Isis and Baba­lon. She is called Queen of the City of Pyramids- a Mystic Name for Binah - therefore her rightful mate is its Lord. She is lunar in nature (again, the Isis attribution of this paragraph), as He the so­lar. \"For he is ever a sun, and she a moon\" (Liber L., 1: 16). 14. Now that is gone in the glow of the cup, and the Angel saith: Not as yet mayest thou understand the mystery of the Beast, for it pertaineth not unto the mystery of this Aire, and few that are new-born unto Understanding are capable thereof. 15. The cup glows ever brighter and fierier. All my sense is un-steady, being smitten with ecstasy. This mystery of the Beast is a mystery of Chokmah. Crowley was advised that being merely \"new-born unto Understanding\" - new­ly received as a Magister Templi within Binah - he could not yet grasp the higher mystery. He is, however, overwhelmed in ecstasy. 16. And the Angel sayeth: Blessed are the saints, that their blood is mingled in the cup, and can never be separate any more. For Babylon the Beautiful, the Mother of abominations, hath sworn by her holy cteis [KTEt�], whereof every point is a pang, that she will not rest from her adulteries until the blood of everything that"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"316 Visions & Voices liveth is gathered therein, and the wine thereof laid up and ma­tured and consecrated, and worthy to gladden the heart of my Father.

A more elaborate restatement of the mystery of \"the blood of the saints,\" which is the key to the Grail Formula. \"Father\" here means the Y od (of iniP) within oneself, the Chokmah of one's be­ing. This is a description of the final stage of the Formula ofini1',1 wherein the blood-wine to which we have been introduced, \"laid up and matured and consecrated\" (as one must do with one's life), rekindles the vitality of the primal impulse of True Will within us. The last sentence uses symbolism of the Rose and Cross to por­tray Nuit, expanding into infinite circumference, and Hadit, fold­ing into the infinitesimal center. (Remember that the diagrammatic model for these cethyrs is 30 concentric spheres or circles, with a cube at the center to represent the material universe.) 17.

The Adept is borne by the Holy Guardian Angel unto the threshold of the Abyss: the perfection of the union of the Adept and the An­gel, each dissolving into the other unto cessation. En route, the Adept experiences the Angel in many different ways, according to the nature and needs of the particular Adept. Every step of Adept­hood-each of the intervening grades between 5°=6° and 8°=3°­represents a technical phase of the single rite wherein one progres­sively pours forth the whole of oneself unreservedly into that which one loves most.

As 5° initiates of Temple of Thelema know, this mystery is also literally \"the heart of the ritual that is accomplished in the Vault of the Adepts,\" as the text says. 18. And this is the meaning of the Supper of the Passover, the spilling of the blood of the Lamb being a ritual of the Dar!:? Brothers, for they have sealed up the Pylon with blood, lest the Angel of Death should enter therein. Thus do they shut them­selves off from the company of the saints. Thus do they l:?eep themselves from compassion and from understanding. Accursed are they, for they shut up their blood in their heart. 19. They l:?eep themselves from the l:?isses of my Mother Baby­lon, and in their lonely fortresses they pray to the false moon. And they bind themselves together with an oath, and with a great curse. And of their malice they conspire together, and they have power, and mastery, and in their cauldrons do they brew the harsh wine of delusion, mingled with the poison of their selfish­ness. 20. Thus they mal:?e war upon the Holy One, sending forth their delusion upon men, and upon everything that liveth. So that their false compassion is called compassion, and their false understanding is called understanding, for this is their most po­tent spell. The mystery of the bloody sacrifice - that is, the sacrificing, or sanctifying, of one's own blood or life by unreservedly surrender­ing it -now is adapted to another purpose. The Passover legend is portrayed as a simile for the \"Dark Brothers\" (what Crowley later called the \"Black Brothers\").' A \"Dark Brother\" is a far thing from a \"black magician\" in the usual sense of that term. The central characteristic is a resistance of the ordeal of the Abyss, a refusal to surrender the illusion of oneself (the centricity of one's ego). It is a fear of death, which ultimately is a fear of love. Those whose way 1 This should be taken as purely metaphoric, not literal.

They know that there is no separation, save for convenience of differentiated function. As Crowley sum­marized: Each Exempt Adept [7°=4°] must choose between the Crossing of the Abyss to become a Master of the Temple, and the building of a false tower of egoism therein. 21. Vet of their own poison do they perish, and in their lonely for­tresses shall they be eaten up by Time that hath cheated them to serve him, and by the mighty devil Choronzon, their master, whose name is the Second Death, for the blood that they have sprinbled on their Pylon, that is a bar against the Angel Death, is the bey by which he entereth in.1 Life needs to breathe, flow, and commingle. Imagine if, in order neither to exhale nor to partake of the sacrament of sharing air with other living things, one chose to keep the air that was in one's lungs, not let it out, and not let any other air in. The results would be ... quick and sure! So it is with the \"Dark Brothers,\" save that it is life itself that they hoard as if it could buy them something of worth. (It is really quite a ridiculous idea. It is staggering to con­sider the scope of the fear-spawned ego-rigidity - or the profound ignorance -that would require it.) 22. The Angel sayeth: And this is the word of double power in the voice of the Master, wherein the Five interpenetrateth the Six.

Do not miss this phrase: \" ... there is no power that may endure, save only the power that descendeth in this my chariot [that is, along the path of Cheth] from Babylon.\" The Strength of Geburah is a received strength from Her unto whom \"all power is given.\" It is Binah that has 50 Gates (among other things, a metaphor of Nun, J, Scorpio, Atu XIII, Death). At last, Crowley is given the name promised him 68 months earlier (Liber L. 1 :22) as he comes to understand that what he heard as \"Babylon\" is BABALON, Jl7��:::l�:::l, which literally would mean \"Gate of the God ON\" (ll7 �� :::1�:::1); that is, of the Sun. ON, ll7, is 120, a number that the Golden Dawn regarded as the key of the Mysteries of Tiphereth (specifically, to the Vault of the Adepts), and that the A:.A:. ap­plies to the equivalent 2°=9° Grade (see Liber CXX, the 2°=9° in­itiation ceremony). ON consists of the letters A'ayin, l7, and Nun, J (two of the paths opening to Tiphereth), and has the same value as the third letter, Samekh, 0, when spelled in full (l1'JO). In a footnote to Liber Samekh, Crowley wrote, \"ON is an Arcanum of Arcana\" - of which only a hint is given in the short space of the foregoing . 23. But this is a mystery utterly beyond thine understanding. For Wisdom is the Man, and Understanding the Woman, and not un­til thou hast perfectly understood canst thou begin to be wise. But I reveal unto thee a mystery of the JEthyrs, that not only are they bound up with the Sephiroth, but also with the Paths. Now, the plane of the JEthyrs interpenetrateth and surroundeth the universe wherein the Sephiroth are established, and therefore is the order of the JEthyrs not the order of the Tree of Life. And only in a few places do they coincide. But the l:?nowledge of the JEth­yrs is deeper than the l:?nowledge of the Sephiroth, for that in the JEthyrs is the l:?nowledge of the JEons, and of E>D.ruw.

Pluto is climactic and transformative. In this specific combination, it focuses those energies on the field of consciousness associated with the Moon. Within a natal chart, Moon square Pluto marks a personality that refuses to be categorized or made to concur with the arbitrary val­ues of others, seeking to avoid too much brainwashing by the out­side world. In the present case, the aspect coincides with a vision that dramatizes a war to cast off habitual responses and thought. In both the Tropical and Sidereal frameworks, the Moon is in Virgo. It is difficult to discern any classic Virgo symbols in the vi­sion. The one psychological premise, central to the vision, which might be taken to confirm a Virgo influence is that this constella­tion, ruled by Mercury and in which Mercury is exalted, is one of the most intellectual of all twelve; and it is against the intellect that Pluto's annihilistic pressures are here directed. Additionally, in this stage where the intellect finally surrenders its sovereignty, Sol and Mercury (for the first time since the 18th .tEthyr) are no longer in partile conjunction. The single, undiluted theme of this vision is the sephirah Yesod. Because 110', Yesod, enumerates to 80, the value of :J, Peh, the letter of Mars, much Mars symbolism supports (rather than contradicting) the Y esod correspondence.

IKH (pronounced Ikahe in the Golden Dawn's distinctive dialect) is the \"last frontier\" of the per­sonality and its proud centerpiece, the intellect. Why is Y esod, the sixth sephirah below the Abyss, thus repre­sented? There are many Qabalistic bases for this symbolism. Most obviously, Y esod is the foundation of the Ruach, or field of self­consciousness. Within the Outer College of A:.A:., Yesod corre­sponds to Air and the intellect. The initiate of Y esod is instructed, \" ... let him remember that being entered thus far upon the Path, he cannot escape it, and return to the world, but must ultimate either in the City of the Pyramids or the lonely towers of the Abyss.\" Most of the symbolism of this vision is of Luna or Y esod, or ( es­pecially), of the 2=9 Grade of the older Golden Dawn. Most importantly, Yesod corresponds to that \"automatic con­sciousness\" which is the seat of habitual response. One of the most pronounced shifts in consciousness characterizing this crossing of the Abyss is a delivery from habituations of thought and reaction . In this vision, we see that last-ditch struggle for survival of our au­tomaticities, the defense of those fortifications that barricade one from participation in the whole. The last wall is preparing to fall. In brief, the vision is a projection of the personality's des­perate struggle to preserve its projections! This 11th iEthyr corresponds to Kether in Briah. It is an apex, and the highest development of one part of us. Like the 21st, it is dominated lzy symbols of Air. IKH or· Ll3(i) = Sagittarius, Fire, Air. It enumerates to 10 + 20 + 5 = 35. Inasmuch as this a:thyr displays the guarded border of the Abyss, the bounding perimeter of the ego, it seems significant that 35 is the value of the Hebrew �:ll, gobal, \"boundary.\" The Air symbolism is obvious. The other letters combine themes of fortification. Also, the first letter, though corresponding to a Jupiter-ruled constellation, was associated by the Greeks and Romans with the archery goddess Artemis or Diana, who was, as well, goddess of the Moon. 1. There appears in the stone immediately the l<amea of the Moon. And it is rolled up; and behind it there appeareth a great Host of Angels. Their bacbs are turned towards me, but I can see how tremendous are their arms, which are swords and spears. They have wings upon their helmets and their heels; they are clad"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"324 Visions & Voices in complete armour, and the least of their swords is liRe the breaRing forth of a tremendous storm of lightning. The least of their spears is liRe a great water-spout. On their shields are the eyes of Tetragrammaton, winged with flame,-white, red, blacR, yellow and blue. On their flanRs are vast squadrons of elephants, and behind them is their meteor-artillery. They that sit upon the elephants are armed with the thunderbolt of Zeus. As stated above, most symbolism in this vision is of Luna, or of the lunar grade of the old Order. Individual paragraphs, therefore, require little commentary other than to identify these lunar sym­bols. The Kamea, or Magick Square, of the Moon, is a 9 x 9 ma­trix (given below) used to create lunar sigils and seals. The mili­tary symbols are of Mars. The five colors correspond to the five elements. Lightning is of Zeus, a god of Air (and the Kether of the Greek pantheon; see my 7761f2, Col. 705). Elephants are ofYesod, as the \"foundation of the world\" in the Hindu system. \"\" nv Qj l7 i'tj :10 l\" 1) n I ! , n'7 t:ll1 ; ltl1 :lj lO 1\" 1ll lll \\' c'7 g N'7 :ll7 n ill il\" 1' nD n ll K!l :1'1 10 1::) 1l ll 'f\" m t:l Kll ll1 l'1 ilO ilj , nl n\" l K :lD 1l7 1'1 1ll lO jj t:ll ..

And indeed he is not visible in his form. Nor does he come to the seer through any of the senses; he is un­derstood, rather than expressed. Y esod, \"foundation,\" implies stability. Shu is the Egyptian god of Air, whose usual posture is the basis of the Sign attributed to the 2°=9° Grade and to Y esod. He characteristically stands holding heaven and earth apart, which is a fair description of one conse­quence of the usual workings of the intellect. 3. I perceive that all this army is defended by fortresses, nine mighty towers of iron upon the frontier of the JEthyr. Each tower is filled with warriors in silver armour. It is impossible to describe the feeling of tension; they are liRe oarsmen waiting for the gun. 4. I perceive that an Angel is standing on either side of me; nay, I am in the midst of a company of armed angels, and their captain is standing in front of me. He too is clad in silver armour; and about him, closely wrapped to his body, is a whirling wind, so swift that any blow strucR against him would be broRen. It is the fortification of the ego against eternity. Nine is the num­ber, and silver the metal, of the Moon. Iron is of Mars, whose Ta­rot card is called \"The Tower.\" Here is the \"braced\" tension of perfect asana, known well to the 2°=9° of A:.A: .. The protective wind, of course, symbolizes Air. 5. And he speaReth unto me these words: 6. Behold, a mighty guard against the terror of things, the fastness of the Most High, the legions of eternal vigilance; these are they that Reep watch and ward day and night throughout the ceons. Set in them is all the force of the Mighty One, yet there stirreth not one plume of the wings of their helmets. 7. Behold, the foundation of the Holy City, the towers and the bastions thereof! Behold the armies of light that are set against the outermost Abyss, against the horror of emptiness, and the malice of Choronzon. Behold how worshipful is the wisdom of the Master, that he hath set his stability in the all-wandering Air and in the changeful Moon. In the purple flashes of the lightning hath He written the word Eternity, and in the wings of the swallow hath He appointed rest."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"326 Visions & Voices 8. By three and by three and by three hath He made firm the foundation against the earthquat?e that is three. For in the num­ber nine is the changefulness of the numbers brought to naught. For with whatsoever number thou wilt cover it, it appeareth un­changed. Now a description of this phase of the psyche begins to be given. These paragraphs will be understood well enough, with what has been stated above. The Holy City is an important allegorical diagram of the old 2=9 ritual (shown here), and \"foundation,\" of course, is the literal meaning of Yesod. Even Choronzon's name (enumerated by Crowley as 333) represents the character­istic knock or knell of the old 2=9 grade, which was given by nine strikes in the pattern 3-3-3. The setting of Wisdom within \"the all-wandering Air and in the changeful Moon\" is the equation 2=9, Chokmah and Yesod. Purple is Yesod's color. \"Eternity\" is 1l71 = 80. Virtually every word is significant! 9. These things are spot?en unto him that understandeth, that is a breastplate unto the elephants, or a corselet unto the angels, or a scale upon the towers of iron; yet is this mighty host set only for a defence, and whoso passeth beyond their lines hath no help in them. 10. Yet must he that understandeth go forth unto the outer­most Abyss, and there must he speat? with him that is set above the four-fold terror, the Princes of Evil, even with Choronzon, the mighty devil that inhabiteth the outermost Abyss. And none may speat? with him, or understand him, but the servants of Babylon, that understand, and they that are without understanding, his servants. One of the most crucial paragraphs of the entire vision: Crowley receives instructions (completed in § 16) for the rethyr following. As will be seen later, these instructions were carried out.

Choronzon is placed above and superior to these! 11. Behold! it entereth not into the heart, nor into the mind of man to conceive this matter; for the sicl:?ness of the body is death, and the sicl:?ness of the heart is despair, and the sicl:?ness of the mind is madness. But in the outermost Abyss is sicl:?ness of the as­piration, and sicl:?ness of the will, and sicl:?ness of the essence of all, and there is neither word nor thought wherein the image of its image is reflected. 12. And whoso passeth into the outermost Abyss, except he be of them that understand, holdeth out his hands, and boweth his necl:?, unto the chains of Choronzon. And as a devil he wall:?eth about the earth, immortal, and he blasteth the flowers of the earth, and he corrupteth the fresh air, and he mal:?eth poisonous the water; and the fire that is the friend of man, and the pledge of his aspiration, seeing that it mounteth ever upward as a pyr­amid, and seeing that man stole it in a hollow tube from Heav­en, even that fire he turneth unto ruin, and madness, and fever, and destruction. And thou, that art an heap of dry dust in the city of the pyramids, must understand these things. Only a Master of the Temple - one who Understands - can pass \"into the outermost Abyss\" other than in submission to the inces­sant intellect, machine-like automaticity, and mindless habituation of response that is Choronzon. Such a person, walking the world, is described as a bearer of corruption. 13. And now a thing happens, which is unfortunately sheer non­sense; for the JEthyr that is the foundation of the universe was attacl:?ed by the Outermost Abyss, and the only way that I can express it is by saying that the universe was shal:?en. But the uni­verse was not shal:?en. And that is the exact truth; so that the ra­tional mind which is interpreting these spiritual things is offended; but, being trained to obey, it setteth down that which it doth not understand. For the rational mind indeed reasoneth, but never attaineth unto Understanding; but the Seer is of them that un­derstand."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"328 Visions & Voices Much is said in this paragraph, but it does not need commentary. It just needs to be understood. 14. And the Angel saith: 15. Behold, He hath established His mercy and His might, and un­to His might is added victory, and unto His mercy is added splen­dour. And all these things hath He ordered in beauty, and He hath set them firmly upon the Eternal Rod�, and therefrom He hath suspended His Ringdom as one pearl that is set in a jewel of threescore pearls and twelve. And He hath garnished it with the Four Holy Living Creatures for Guardians, and He hath graven therein the seal of righteousness} and He hath burnished it with the fire of His Angel, and the blush of His loveliness informeth it, and with delight and with wit hath He made it merry at the heart, and the core thereof is the Secret of His being, and therein is His name Generation. And this His stability hath the number 80, for that the price thereof is War? Simple Qabalah. Geburah reflects into Netzach, as Chesed into Hod. Tiphereth rests in the center, harmonizing these. Y esod is the Eternal Rock, or foundation, on which it all rests. (This is the mys­tery of Peter or Cephas, the Rock or Stone: KH<l>AI = 729 = 93• See Gematria by Bligh Bond and Lea.) 16. Beware, therefore, 0 thou who art appointed to understand the secret of the Outermost Abyss, for in every Abyss thou must assume the masR and form of the Angel thereof. Hadst thou a name, thou wert irrevocably lost. Search, therefore, if there be yet one drop of blood that is not gathered into the cup of Baby­lon the Beautiful, for in that little pile of dust, if there could be one drop of blood, it should be utterly corrupt; it should breed scorpions and vipers, and the cat of slime. Final counsel is given to Crowley in preparation of his pending Ordeal of the Outermost Abyss. The instruction is simple in con­cept: In this ordeal, there must be nothing of him left, nothing of his distinctive life flowing through him.

That is not what the following record preserves. Almost entirely, it is, the text of Victor Neuburg's expe­rience of these two hours. Other than the first two lines, and the actions observed in §59 at the end, there is virtually nothing of Crowley in it at all. (Wasn't that the point?) Nor is there a real ar­ticulated \"vision and voice\" of the rethyr. Still, this record is our best account of one of the most extraor­dinary magical events in modem times. What actually happened? A magical circle was cast, and a tri­angle of evocation placed outside of it, all very similar to what is recommended in The Goetia and other classic grimoires. Neuburg was safely placed within the circle to keep watch, and to serve as scribe. Three pigeons were slain, and their blood spilled within the comers of the triangle to serve as an etheric basis for the attraction and manifestation of the demon Choronzon. But there is one detail the text does not give - which, in fact, Crowley went out of his way to obscure. Crowley placed himself in the triangle to serve as the living basis for Choronzon's mani­festation. He invoked Choronzon into himself. His confrontation with the demon was within. His weapons were concentration and"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"334 Visions & Voices silence. When the text says that he was to \"retire to a secret place, where is neither sight nor hearing,\" this was not a physical place, but, rather, the depths of meditation. It makes no difference that the man sitting in the triangle did not appear very concentrated or silent. The essence of Crowley was withdrawn, in meditation impenetrable. (His powers of con­centration were formidable.) What was left behind was the shell of his personality, devoid of a guiding central principle. It was in this q 'lippah of the Adept that Choronzon manifested fully. What is truly extraordinary, though, is that Neuburg, even late in life, insisted to his intimates that this is not what happened -that he literally fought a demon in the desert that day. There is no reason to believe he thought anything different. The explanation is that Neuburg was a powerful psychic sensitive. He naturally re­sponded to and absorbed nearly any strong psychic impression. It would seem that the psychic intensity of Crowley's invocation and inner process was so intense as to impress itself on Neuburg's mind with the reality of physical sensory conviction. It was this tremendous psychic sensitivity that required the ex­ceptional precautions Crowley employed. At first, these seem little more than the medieval classic evocation formulre. They were, in fact, much more. An examination of the preliminary details re­veals that Neuburg was especially placed in a magical environ­ment attuned to the element Air, and fortified with the tools of Air and the intellect. If \"crossing the Abyss\" involves the abdication of the particular psychic patterns that constitute the intellect (it does!), then Neuburg's instructions were likely to ensure that he would not make such a crossing, would not get sucked into the vortex of consciousness created by the vacuum of Crowley's dis­solution. Crowley's preliminaries fixed Neuburg in the Domain of Air, and kept his intellect busy. The horoscope for the vision's start is quite descriptive. Saturn had just risen (bodily it was only 2°35' above the Ascendant), and was exactly on the Eastpoint-a perfect description of what Crow­ley later called \"the terrible lOth lEthyr.\" Additionally, the Uranus­Neptune opposition was again near the meridian, still square Crowley's natal Sun. We have seen a pattern of this pair being foreground at the start of particular visions that were intensely transformative -that is, simultaneously ego-dissolving (W) and awakening-enlightening (ljl).

As in the last vision, the Moon is in Si­dereal Virgo where it has a similar significance - but in the Tropi­cal framework it had moved into Libra where it has no relevance at all, except the flitting appearance of a seductress at one point. Another clue that this record is not of Crowley's actual experi­ence, but only of Neuburg's, is in the symbolism of the rethyr's name. ZAX or � ;r = Leo, Taurus, Earth. To make the point more poignantly, lay out the three Tarot trumps corresponding, Atus XI (Lust), V (The Hierophant), and XXI (The Universe). Meditate on these for several minutes. Feel the energies originat­ing in the bright, passionate solar ferocity, the white heat of bhakti taken to its flash point of fervor - then the concentration of this so­lar-phallic force in the essence of his Inmost Teacher, the Wis­dom-stream that is the true Revealer of the Mysteries - and then its dissolution into the infinite dark of space, the void of Saturn. This does not at all match what appears in the record of the vision! But I would bet it runs pretty close to Crowley's actual journey. The numeration of ZAX (7 + 1 + 400 = 408) is hard to assess since we do not truly have a record of Crowley's experience of the rethyr. From what little we can see, 408 does not produce anything truly compelling. Finally, this rethyr corresponds to Malkuth in Atziluth. It is the crossing-over point from the sephiroth in Briah (the natural domain of the Adept) into Atziluth (the realm of divinity and of the Master) - which sums the matter up quite nicely! More com­pletely, Choronzon is called \"the maker of all form,\" responsible for every possible projection upon the screen of the senses, which is a particularly appropriate expression for Malkuth, the field of the manifestation of innumerable expressions of Kether, here poised to precipitate its phenomena into the World of Briah. a. This JEthyr being accursed, and the seer forewarned, he tal:?eth these precautions for the scribe. �· First let the scribe be seated in the centre of the circle in the desert sand, and let the circle be fortified by the Holy Names of Cod -T etragrammaton and Shaddai El Chai and Ararita."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"336 Visions & Voices The circle is surrounded with the Divine Names ruling Air (f'l1iP) and Y esod ('n �N '1lV), the two names traditionally employed to open the Temple of Yesod and of Air.

And let the Scribe perform the Banishing Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram, and let him call upon the Holy Names of God, and say the Exorcism of Honorius, and let him beseech protection and help of the Most High. As discussed in Chapter 2, Choronzon is the \"mighty devil\" first mentioned in Dee's diaries. Crowley transliterated the name as l1lJ111n = 333, the value of Greek words for \"incontinence\" and \"dispersion.\" &.

Not only was Neuburg's magick circle charged with Air names, but he was armed with both the quill of the scribe and the magick dagger, the chief Air implement. Observe also the terms of his oath: He was to employ the power of the dagger (intellect) forti­fied by wariness and cunning. In other words - and adding this to his primary duty of transcribing each thing he heard - his mind is being kept terribly busy while all of this is going on! This appears to have been a prophylaxis Crowley created for the psychically sensitive Neuburg, an anchoring in the intellect, to keep him from being swept into the Abyss in Crowley's wake.

There is no being in the outermost Abyss, but constant forms come forth from the nothingness of it. This preliminary line appears to describe Crowley's perception of the Abyss as he started to descend, within himself, into that \"secret place, where is neither sight nor hearing.\" 1. Then the Devil of the JEthyr, that mighty devil Choronzon, cri­eth aloud, Zazas, Zazas, Nasatanada Zazas. In Hebrew characters: O�nn �1�)�\"0�0�) O�l�l O�l�l.

It is well known to the Ne­ophyte 1 °= 10° of A:. A:. . According to legend, by this phrase Adam opened the pit of hell. 2. I am the Master of Form, and from me all forms proceed. This is a superb expression of Malkuth (the field of manifestation) in Atziluth (the root world whence manifestation streams). 3. I am I.

It is the assertion that blocks the transcendence of the Abyss, the motto of what were called the \"Dark Brothers\" in the 12th JEthyr. It asserts the inviolability of the ego, which is a lie. Choronzon ut­ters all the catch phrases of one who would resist the Abyss. 4. (Here the Spirit simulated the voice of Frater P., which also appeared to come from his station and not from the triangle.) Choronzon was Frater Perdurabo (Crowley). His voice came from within the triangle where Crowley was seated. The simulation was rather easy, I imagine! s. I don't thinR I can get any more; I thinR that's all there is. 6. (The Frater was seated in a secret place covered completely by a blacR robe, in the position called the \"Thunderbolt.\" He did not move or speaR during the ceremony.) The asana, or posture, called \"Thunderbolt\" is a variety of kneel­ing pose in which one sits back squarely on one heel (the spine be­ing kept straight), while the other foot, balanced on its toes, is poised over the genitals. The hands rest on the knees. 1. Next the Scribe was hallucinated, believing that before him was a beautiful courtesan whom previously he had loved in Par­is. Now, she wooed him with soft words and glances, but he Rnew these things for delusions of the devil, and he would not leave the circle. 8. The demon then laughed wildly and loud. 9. (Upon the Scribe threatening him, the Demon proceeded, after a short delay.) The first time Neuburg sees the physical form of Crowley as something entirely different, he characterizes it as a hallucination. Yet, the image is not far-fetched, since Crowley had already served as \"seductress\" to Neuburg only days before."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"j I :1 II ! l 'I I �� :,� 340 Visions & Voices 10.

(Here Choronzon attempts to seduce the Scribe by appeal­ing to his pride. 12. But the Scribe refused to be tempted, and commanded the demon to continue with the JEthyr. 13. There was again a short delay.) Crowley-as-Choronzon continues speaking. Note that most of what he says during this two-hour period cannot be trusted. He is a lying, deceptive spirit, the Arch-demon of Lies. As tempting as it may be to derive doctrine from much of this text, it all should be viewed with the greatest suspicion-or, at least, prudence! It is a great example of how a spirit can toy with one's mind and emo­tions while attempting to wrest away the upper hand. 14.

A beautiful woman, a wise and holy man, and a snake: It is easy to see how all three of these are aspects of Crowley, as Neuburg ex­perienced him.

(This last was spo�en from the triangle in the natural voice of the Frater, which Choronzon again simulated. But he did not succeed in ta�ing the Frater's form - which was absurd! Why would it be absurd that Choronzon, in the triangle, not have Crowley's form, unless ... ? 20. The Scribe resisted the appeal to his pity, and conjured the demon to proceed by the names of the Most High. Choronzon attempted also to seduce the faithfulness of the Scribe. A long colloquy ensued. The Scribe cursed him by the Holy Names of God, and the power of the Pentagram.) 21. I feed upon the names of the Most High. I churn them in my jaws, and I void them from my fundament. I fear not the power of the Pentagram, for I am the Master of the Triangle. My name is three hundred and thirty and three, and that is thrice one. Be vigilant, therefore, for I warn thee that I am about to de­ceive thee. I shall say words that thou wilt ta�e to be the cry of the JEthyr, and thou wilt write them down, thin�ing them to be great secrets of Magic� power, and they will be only my jesting with thee. Choronzon identifies himself as 333; but Crowley had worked this out in advance. It is \"thrice one\" because Aleph, �, the Hebrew numeral 1, is spelled�?� = 111; thrice this is 333, or Choronzon. 22.

Neuburg asserted that \"he knew more than the demon.\" In hind­sight we can only shake our heads in bemused amazement that he did not get eaten alive. There is no surer way to fall before the embodiment of unlimited empty knowledge than to arm-wrestle it in the matter of learning. (See also §27 and §31.) At least Neu­burg was fearless! 25. Thou canst tell me naught that I !:?now not, for in me is all Knowledge: Knowledge is my name. Is not the head of the great Serpent arisen into Knowledge? He identifies himself with Da'ath, \"Knowledge.\" This is the literal meaning of the word; but it also means \"knowledge\" in the older sense of conjugal union. Da'ath is the union of Chokmah and Bi­nah, from which comes forth Tiphereth, their child. The outer as­pect of Da'ath is \"knowledge\" in the sense of intellect run amok, taken to its highest degree; but there is an inner aspect that is the ecstasy of Babalon and union within the Supemals. Da' ath should not be confused with the Abyss, even though it is said to abide within the Abyss. Of the inner aspect of Da'ath, Choronzon has no part. 26.

All the time he had a sense of being protected from Cho­ronzon, and this sense of security prevented his bnowing fear. 64. Several times did the Scribe threaten to put a curse upon the demon; but ever, before he uttered the words of the curse, did the demon obey him. For himself, he bnoweth not the words of the curse. 65. Also is it meet to record in this place that the Scribe several times whistled in a Magical manner, which never before had he attempted, and the demon was apparently much discomfited thereat. 66. Now bnoweth the Scribe that he was wrong in holding much converse with the demon; for Choronzon, in the confusion and chaos of his thought, is much terrified by silence. And by si­lence can he be brought to obey. 67. For cunningly doth he talb of many things, going from sub­ject to subject, and thus he misleadeth the wary into argument with him. And though Choronzon be easily beaten in argument, yet, by disturbing the attention of him who would command him, doth he gain the victory. 68. For Choronzon feareth of all things concentration and si­lence: he therefore who would command him should will in si­lence: thus is he brought to obey. 69. This the Scribe bnoweth; for that since the obtaining of the Accursed Tenth JEthyr, he hath held converse with Choronzon. And unexpectedly did he obtain the information that he sought after having long refused to answer the demon's speeches. 70. Choronzon is dispersion; and such is his fear of concentra­tion that he will obey rather than be subjected to it, or even be­hold it in another. 71. The account of the further dealings of Choronzon with the Scribe will be found in the Record of Omnia Vincam. The \"Note by Scribe\" was written after the fact, and therefore is not the utterance of Choronzon. It gives exact instructions for con­fronting and defeating Choronzon.

As the vision began, she was in the exact degree that held the Sun at Aleister Crowley's birth. This transit, though brief, commonly marks a couple of hours every month when we appreciate being the center of attention. The world is primed to adore us, and we accept. This is all quite evident in the opening of the vision - in which the gods threw Crowley a party! It is a hero's welcome, the recep­tion of a new Magister Templi following his facing of Choronzon in the 1Oth .tEthyr, triumphant in his Ordeal of the Abyss. How Crowley responded to this adulation is another matter. Frankly, we have no clue. If he truly destroyed himself in his crossing of the Abyss, then this would have had little ego­aggrandizing effect on him. If not - it would have had quite a lot. It is certainly likely that he was rebounding into the sunlight in compensation (balance) for the depths of despair and darkness, which marked his submersion in the 1Oth .tEthyr the day before. Venus was transiting in square to Crowley's Neptune, but this seemed much stronger the day following. I cannot detect a clear expression of it in this vision. One other astrological factor is worth mentioning - one that is fundamental to the vision's symbolism. It is the Moon-sign. In the Sidereal Zodiac, the Moon was in Virgo. The entire vision centers"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"352 Visions & Voices on the Daughter of Babalon, who is called \"the Virgin of Eternity\" and identified with various Virgo goddess expressions (§6). She is even called Betulah, the Hebrew name for Virgo. While the Tropi­cal Zodiac's Libra placement for Luna could -much more vaguely - claim almost any goddess archetype as corresponding to its V e­n us rulership (and would symbolically match the \"balancing act\" in the early paragraphs), it lacks the precision of the Virgo place­ment. Virgo exactly captures the primary symbolism. ZIP or ::Pl..O =Leo, Sagittarius, Cancer. It enumerates to 7 + 10 + 80 = 97, of which the best correspondence is LIBER MUNDI, \"The Book ofthe World.\" A suitable hieroglyph for Leo-Sagittarius-Cancer might be an angel standing equilibrated between the Sun and Moon. This is nicely descriptive of the earliest images in the vision. I remain undecided whether this vision adequately expresses symbolism ofYesod of Atziluth, to which it corresponds. Nothing contradicts that, and several features appear that could be as much Yesod as anything else. But nothing stands out unequivocally. What is evident, though, is a new scheme, first mentioned in this vision, for attributing the sephiroth to the rethyrs. It marks the 91h LEthyr as the entrance to Binah. This perspective is clear enough. The schema will be discussed in its place below. 00. (The terrible Curse that is the Call of the Thirty JEthyrs sounds li�e a song of ecstasy and triumph; every phrase in it has a secret meaning of blessing.) Each of these visions was preceded by chanting \"The Call of the 30 LEthyrs,\" an Enochian invocation that helps open them. (See Chapter 3.) Until this point, Crowley had understood many of its phrases as horrible apocalyptic curses. Now, newly passed through the Abyss, he heard them quite differently. The reader can discern this for himself or herself- merely being careful not to stop with one's first reflexive understanding of a given passage. o.

(Verse 1 says he is walking \"upon a ray\" of Venus.) He is above the armies of the 11th Aire, the warring chaos of his intellect and reactive automatic consciousness, and no longer involved with them except when they are united in a single song. In the fashion of a Greek drama, an angel (I= .>?') comes forth to lead the song. Its verses describe much of the doctrine of the na­ture of the Master of the Temple 8°=3°, the initiate of Binah. They should be studied closely, preferably alongside Liber Cheth (in Appendix C). He that was Aleister Crowley is Nemo, \"no­one.\" The wings of Maut, the devouring vulture-mother, symbol of Binah and Neshamah, uphold him. Verse 5 echoes the Prayer of the Gnomes: \"Thou who wearest the Heavens on Thy Finger like a ring of Sapphire;\" here, it shows his Tiphereth absorbed into Bi­nah. In Verse VI, \"city of God\" is not only a common supernal symbol, but may allude to Betulah, which means both \"virgin\" and \"city.\"' The \"Mother and Babe\" are Isis and Horus, Madonna and Christ-child, or any other cognate, the common posture of which is the grade sign of the 8°=3°. Verse IV is more complex. It shows the eventual pouring of Chokmah into Binah. The Ibis and Crab symbols are from the 151h lEthyr, where they were attributed to Chokmah and Binah, respec­tively. The six-fold star refers to Binah and the radiant Triangle re­fers to Chokmah.Z At the same time, they show the final merger of the Hexagram of Adepthood into the Supernal Triangle of Mas­tery. (Binah partakes of both numbers.) The Refrain is quite beautiful. Its first sentence refers to Hadit, Nuit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit, or any other triad of gods implying Chokmah, Binah, and Tiphereth (father, mother, and child). This is echoed in the second sentence, where \"star\" and \"snake\" refer to Nuit and Hadit, and the \"swordsman\" is Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Verse VII, however, seals the final description. The allusion is to the alchemical and Qabalistic symbolism of \"the stone rejected by the builders.\" In the building of Solomon's temple, a particular stone was discarded as useless because it did not fit any precon­ceived mold. Eventually, though, it was found to be perfectly shaped to serve as the keystone for the arch. In the vision it means 1 See C.G. Jung's Symbolism ofthe Mother & of Rebirth.

To state it in the simplest terms: the foremost characteristic of the at­tainment of the grade of Master of the Temple is the viewing of the world as it truly is, unimpeded by the mental and reactive emotional fil­ters and habituations of the personality. It is an epiphany of the nature of the sensual universe. In this regard, the 8°=3° Grade, though one of the Inmost, is also perhaps the Outermost. This resolves many a paradox and puzzle of the relationship of the Supernal Saturn in Binah to Saturn-the­Materializer in Tav, n. At its extreme, it is samadhi on manifestation. More commonly it is expressed by the Vision of Wonder-what Crow­ley, in Little Essays Toward Truth, called the natural successor of the Trance of Sorrow that is the approach way to Binah. This psychological process is substantially what is meant by \"placing the Daughter (ii) on the Throne of the Mother (i1).\" 2. Now then we are passed within the lines of the army, and we are come unto a palace of which every stone is a separate jewel, and is set with millions of moons. 3. And this palace is nothing but the body of a woman, proud and delicate, and beyond imagination fair. She is libe a child of twelve years old. She has very deep eye-lids, and long lashes. Her eyes are closed, or nearly closed. It is impossible to say anything about her. She is nabed; her whole body is covered with fine gold hairs, that are the electric flames that are the spears of mighty and terrible Angels whose breast-plates are the scales of her sbin. And the hair of her head, that flows down to her feet, is the very light of God himself. Of all the glories beheld by the seer in the A:thyrs, there is not one which is worthy to be compared with her littlest finger-nail. For although he may not partabe of the A:th­yr, without the ceremonial preparations, even the beholding of this A:thyr from afar is libe the partabing of all the former A:th­yrs.

And the first nine are infinitely holy. And he says, It is written in the Boob of the Law, \"Wisdom says, be strong. Then canst thou bear more joy/' \"If thou drinb, drinb by the eight and ninety rules of Art.\" And this shall signify unto thee that thou must undergo great discipline; else the Vision were lost or per­verted. For these mysteries pertain not unto thy grade. Therefore must thou invobe the Highest before thou unveil the shrines thereof. This symbol of the angel backed by a svastika was one of the first things seen in the beginning of this series of visions almost a dec­ade earlier. The svastika is a symbol of Kether. It is also a varia­tion of the emblem by which Crowley first gained initiation into the Sphere ofMalkuth in the Golden Dawn 1=10 ceremony. The \"nine towers\" are, again, from the imagery of the 11th JEthyr §3, and represent the mass-mind psychological foundations of the world. We are next introduced (though only by allusion) to the third important technical detail of this vision. It is \"the map of the lEth­yrs, that are arranged as a flaming Sword, so that the thirty JEthyrs go into the ten sephiroth.\" Crowley's only note to this is a remark that this teaching is reserved for initiates. It was, in fact, commu­nicated in the Practicus Adeptus Minor (P.A.M.) grade of the Golden Dawn, though it is unclear that Crowley received the in­struction through those channels. Two models are given. One is the model we have been following most closely throughout this se­ries, in which JEthyrs 30 through 21 correspond to the ten se­phiroth (from Malkuth to Kether) in Yetzirah; JEthyrs 20 through 11, to the sephiroth in Briah; and JEthyrs 1 0 through 1 to the se­phiroth in Atzi1uth. This has proven an important key to under­standing the architecture of these Aires and their associated vi­sions. But the second model has had no mention until now -until the point it first appears in the visions themselves. It is a frame­work in which the 30th, 29th, and 28th lEthyrs correspond to Malkuth; the next three to Y esod; and so on up the Tree. By this model, the three visions beginning with the present one (9t\\ 8th, and 7th) contain the work ofBinah. In reviewing the first 21 visions along these lines, I am struck by the fact that the first of the three usually shows striking sym­bolism of the sephirah indicated; but this is generally not true for the other two. 1 It is­phasized this m� � now, the visions �.

But now, the visions themselves demand it. Note that the method \"beyond\" his Binah grade is a method of Wisdom, or Chokmah. Crowley would not attain to the 9°=2° Grade of Chokmah for another six years. 19. And this shall be thy rule: A thousand and one times shalt thou affirm the unity, and bow thyself a thousand and one times. And thou shalt recite thrice the call of the JEthyr. And all day and all night, awabe or asleep, shall thy heart be turned as a lotus­flower unto the light. And thy body shall be the temple of the Rosy Cross. Thus shall thy mind be open unto the higher; and then shalt thou be able to conquer the exhaustion, and it may be find the words - for who shall loob upon His face and live? An important practical instruction is given. It is far subtler than it may seem at first, but is ultimately quite simple. In the 18th JEthyr, Crowley had been provided a technical method to use thereafter in the exploration of these rethyrs. By the sephirothic model just explained, the 18th Aire marked the en­trance into Tiphereth, and its symbolism rested on the architecture of the Vault of the Adepts. Now, upon his entrance into Binah in this 9th JEthyr, that method is set aside, and a new one provided that requires no temples, no walls, and no props. The method is simply to bow and \"affirm the unity\" 1,001 times per day. After this, the Call of the JEthyr was to be recited thrice - presumably for the symbolism ofBinah and the Supemals. While Crowley understood this in the formal sense of reciting the Islamic \"Chapter of Unity\" 1,001 times per day (and, while 1,001 has its own unique importance, from the Arabian Nights to the petals of the Sahasrara-chakra) it would appear that some­thing even simpler is implied-but not necessarily something easi­er! 1,001 is roughly the number of minutes the typical person is awake in the course of a day. (It is just a little more than 16'li hours.) Crowley claimed he did this while marching, including pausing to bow. If so, he did not get much marching done! But, 1 Review the visions of the 30th, 27th, 24th, 21'\\ 18th, 15th, and 12th LEthyrs with an eye to their symbolic consistency with Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, Netzach, Tiph­ereth, Geburah, and Chesed, respectively."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"360 Visions & Voices more elegantly, this instruction to the Magister Templi can be un­derstood to mean that every waking minute shall be spent af­firming the unity, and bowing oneself before it. This is ex­plained further by the image of continually turning one's heart, as a lotus flower, to the light, in waking and sleeping alike. This being done, the traditional Rosicrucian benediction in­voked upon the new Adeptus Minor is accomplished: One's mind being thus open to the higher (by the conscious affirmation of uni­ty every waking minute), and one's heart made a center of Light, one's body becomes a true Temple of the Rosy Cross. 20. Yea, thou tremblest, but from within; because of the holy spirit that is descended into thy heart, and shaReth thee as an aspen in the wind. The newly initiated Adept, at the recitation of those words, was crowned with the Holy Spirit (l:l�i1l;N n11 =300), or Shin, tv. In contrast, the Master is filled with it. 21. They also tremble that are without, and they are shaRen from without by the earthquaRes of his judgment.

In this vision, Aiwass stepped in to deliver an official A:. A:. instruction, which is the quintessence of the method given in the book, The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage. It is an instruction for attaining to the Knowledge & Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel (5°=6°), and, thereafter and by the Angel's guidance, the Ordeal of the Abyss and the Grade of Master of the Temple (8°=3°) beyond it. We again find Uranus-Neptune across the horizon. In these vi­sions, their angularity has always marked the most consciousness­transforming. (The present \"vision\" was a two-hour visitation from Crowley's H.G.A.!) Mars was exactly on the Midheaven. The vision was, to say the least, strenuous. Jupiter added an obvi­ous royal contribution from the IC. Venus' square to Crowley's Neptune probably referred to the intimacy with his Angel. A Sun-Saturn trine in space had no strik­ing effect on the vision (though it may have encouraged Crowley and Neuburg's frustrating travel delays earlier that day).

Each of these letters and images describes an aspect of the Knowledge & Con­versation of the Holy Guardian Angel. This cethyr corresponds to Hod in Atziluth. It is an overt in­struction from a supernal source. It compares profitably to the 18th JEthyr. We are told in §37 that the main instruction is complete, and we need not \"seek to better\" it. Therefore, for §§5-26 we shall limit ourselves to clarifying terms and other support explanations. 1. There appears in the stone a tiny sparR of light. It grows a little, and seems almost to go out, and grows again, and it is blown about the JEthyr, and by the wind that blows it is it fanned, and now it gathers strength, and darts liRe a snaRe or a sword, and now it steadies itself, and is liRe a Pyramid of light that filleth the whole JEthyr. These resemble the phenomena of dharana, or yogic concentra­tion, as it settles into a deeper state. (The wind is the movement of the intellect.) \"Snake\" and \"sword\" are two common ways of rep­resenting the component parts of the Tree of Life - the former as­cending via the paths, and the latter flashing downward manifest­ing the sephiroth. The pyramid is a mark of initiation, and a sym­bol of spiritual fire. 2. And in the Pyramid is one liRe unto an Angel, yet at the same time he is the Pyramid, and he hath no form because he is of the substance of light, and he taReth not form upon him, for though by him is form visible, he maReth it visible only to destroy it. The H.G.A. is the pyramid, the sacred phallus, or creative spiritual fire -the initiator. As mentioned previously, the Greek word for \"pyramid\" is nup<lf.lu; = 831 = <jl<lAAoc;, phallus, and 1��, Aleph."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"364 Visions & Voices 3. And he saith: The light is come to the darl:lness, and the darl:l­ness is made light. Then is light married with light, and the child of their love is that other darl:lness, wherein they abide that have lost name and form. Therefore did I l:lindle him that had not un­derstanding, and in the Boot? of the Law did I write the secrets of truth that are lil:le unto a star and a snal:le and a sword. The first darkness is Nephesh, or subconsciousness. The light is Ruach, or ego-consciousness. The second darkness is Neshamah, or super-consciousness. Aiwass \"enkindled\" Crowley even when he was not a Master, that He might deliver The Book of the Law. Star, snake, and sword, as in the last cethyr, refer, respectively, to the three chapters of that Book. 4. And unto him that understandeth at last do I deliver the se­crets of truth in such wise that the least of the little children of the light may run to the l:lnees of the mother and be brought to un­derstand. The new Master is now instructed. A commonly overlooked detail is that this is an instruction on how to attain to 8°=3°, not just 5°=6°; but the method taught is to get to 5°=6°, and then follow the single further instruction in §26. §§5-26: The method is detailed. 5. And thus shall he do who will attain unto the mystery of the l:lnowledge and conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel: 6.

And if it be in a town, the room shall have no window, and if it be in the country, then it is better if the window be in the roof. Or, if it be possible, let this invocation be performed in a temple prepared for the ritual of passing through the T uat. This refers to the adytum of the A:.A:. 2°=9° initiation. 8.

And he shall engrave with his own hand upon a plate of gold the Holy Sevenfold Table, or the Holy Twelvefold Table, or some particular device. And it shall be foursquare within a circle, and the circle shall be winged, and he shall attach it about his forehead by a ribbon of blue silb. 14.

Now he shall pray thrice daily, about sunset, and at mid­night, and at sunrise. And if he be able, he shall pray also four times between sunrise and sunset. 16.

Thus shall he invoRe his Holy Guardian Angel for eleven weeRs, and in any case he shall pray seven times daily during the last weeR of the eleven weeRs. § 16 concentrates and expresses the essential elements of the whole operation. 17. And during all this time he shall have composed an invocation suitable, with such wisdom and understanding as may be given him from the Crown, and this shall he write in letters of gold upon the top of the altar. 18. For the top of the altar shall be of white wood, well pol­ished, and in the centre thereof he shall have placed a triangle of oaR-wood, painted with scarlet, and upon this triangle the three legs of the censer shall stand. 19.

All this while there hath been no vision, but only a voice, very slow and clear and deliberate. But now the vision returns, and the voice says: Thou shalt be called Dance, that art stunned and slain beneath the weight of the glory of the vision that as yet thou seest not. For thou shalt suffer many things, until thou art mightier than all the Kings of the earth, and all the Angels of the Heavens, and all the gods that are beyond the Heavens. Then shalt thou meet me in equal conflict, and thou shalt see me as I am. And I will overcome thee and slay thee with the red rain of my lightnings. There was \"no vision, but only a voice;\" i.e., it was wholly of Spirit, which corresponds to hearing. 30. I am lying underneath this pyramid of light. It seems as if I had the whole weight of it upon me, crushing me with bliss. And yet I !:?now that I am lil:?e the prophet that said: I shall see Him, but not nigh. 31. And the Angel sayeth: So shall it be until they that wal:?e are asleep, and she that sleepeth be arisen from her sleep. For thou art transparent unto the vision and the voice. And therefore in thee they manifest not. But they shall be manifest unto them unto whom thou dost deliver them, according unto the word which I spal:?e unto thee in the Victorious City. \"not nigh\" - He has a job to do first.

And that Cate is the Path that joineth the Wisdom with the Understanding. He clarifies he is Aiwass, and Crowley's \"guardian.\" It was still a new idea to Crowley that Aiwass, who dictated Liber Legis, was his H.G.A. Crowley had counted Aiwass' name as 78 (he only learned years later that it was 93), so there is some confusion in these references to that number. 78 is the number of cards in the Tarot. TARO (as l71�n) = 671 = 'J1�, Adonai, \"my Lord,\" spelled in plenitude, and �l71n, t 'raa, \"gate.\" Why, though, does Aiwass say his name is \"eight and seventy\" if it is not? There are many possible reasons. It simply may have been the best way to communicate to Crowley's psyche at the time. Additionally, 8 and 70 are the values of n, The Chariot, and l7, The Devil, corresponding to his self-description as \"the influ­ence (n) of the Concealed One (l7).\" (n is called the \"House of In­fluence.\") There may be some significance in the Cancer-Cap­ricorn axis corresponding to n and l7; for example, within Crow­ley's understanding (founded in the Tropical Zodiac), these were the signs of the summer and winter solstice, the Sun's most ex­treme northern and southern declination (respectively) - as if to say, the extremes of Height and Depth of the Light. 33. Thus hast thou erred indeed, perceiving me in the path that leadeth from the Crown unto the Beauty. For that path bridgeth the abyss, and I am of the supernals. Nor I, nor Thou, nor He can bridge the abyss. It is the Priestess of the Silver Star, and the Ora­cles of the gods, and the Lord of the Hosts of the Mighty. For they are the servants of Babalon, and of the Beast, and of those others of whom it is not yet spoRen. And, being servants, they have no name, but we are of the blood royal, and serve not, and there­fore are we less than they. He speaks to Crowley as Chokmah to Binah. The Priestess, The Lovers, and (as then understood) The Emperor of Tarot corre­spond to the paths l, l, and i1, which connect the supernal se­phiroth to Tiphereth. They are, therefore, called servants of Baba­lon (Binah), the Beast (Chokmah), and the unnamed ones of Kether. Notice the high value placed on service as a virtue. 34.

The Master is equated with Persephone (rJ, the Daughter, Mal­kuth), who became the bride of Hades, the Hidden One -a symbol of the Holy Guardian Angel, or spiritual unconscious. She then was enthroned as Queen (i1) of the inner realms. 35.

But this shall be unto thee for a sign, that I will surely come upon thee unawares and appear unto thee. And it is no odds, (i.e., that at this hour I appear not as I am), for so terrible is the glory of the vision, and so wonderful is the splendour of the voice, that when thou seest it and hearest it in truth, for many hours shalt thou be bereft of sense. And thou shalt lie between heaven and earth in a void place, entranced, and the end thereof shall be silence, even as it was, not once nor twice, when I have met with thee, as it were, upon the road to Damascus. 37.

Not only do Venus symbols saturate the text of the vision, but multiple factors state this theme for the hour Crowley began his vision. At the vision's start, Venus was exactly on the western horizon. Additionally, Crowley's natal Venus was exactly on the IC. In the Sidereal Zodiac, the Moon was in Libra. Furthermore, the 0, or l., in the name DEO corresponds to Libra; the <ethyr corresponds to N etzach in Atziluth; and the number 7 is itself just too good to pass up for Venus symbolism. Uranus and Neptune are also on the angles-in this case, the Eastpoint-Westpoint. Of all the visions where they have been thus prominent, this is probably the least dramatically transformative. Yet, also, during the two hours of the vision, the Moon was transiting in conjunction with Crowley's natal Mercury - and it shows! For all of the Venus elements, and the vision's saturation with Venus correspondences, his account of it is incredibly mer­curial. The text of this vision, following an initial symbolic setup, is almost end-to-end gematria and other uses of the \"literal Qaba­lah.\" His brain would not stop ticking. In the commentary follow­ing, I will be able to do little more than annotate his Qabalah. In places, his mind is racing as if he were on heavy stimulants. Do I think he was?

This is the value of��J�, Ancel, the name of the Angel of Venus, and of mn�J, niychuach, which means \"sweet, pleasant, beloved.\" 1. The stone is divided, the left half dar�, the right half light, and at the bottom thereof is a certain blac�ness, of three divergent columns. And it seems as if the bloc� and white halves were the halves of a door, and in the door is a little �ey-hole, in the shape of the Astrological symbol of Venus. And from the �ey-hole issue flames, blue and green and violet, but without any touch of yel­low or red in them. It seems as if there were a wind beyond the door, that is blowing the flame out. 2. And a voice comes: \"Who is he that hath the �ey to the gate of the evening star?\" From the beginning, Venus symbols are established. The keyhole shaped as 9, the flames in the blue-green end of the spectrum (avoiding solar-martial yellows and reds altogether), the words \"door\" and \"gate\" (implying Daleth, 1; see page 27), and the di­rect reference to Venus in her guise as the evening star - all these set the stage. The flames themselves are likely part of the same symbols. Venus is attributed to the element Fire, because of Netzach's at­tribution thereto. Additionally, Daleth itself pertains to Fire: in The 32 Paths of Wisdom we read that she is \"called the Luminous Con­sciousness, because it is the essence of that brilliant flame which is the instructor in the Secret Foundations of Holiness .... \" 3.

The balancing of 7 and 4 is native to the sephiroth Netzach (4°=7°) and Chesed (7°=4°). Here, it appears in not quite either of those contexts. Inherently, Venus is 7 by virtue of her corre­spondence to Netzach, and 4 as the value of Daleth, 1. She equili­brates these numbers within herself. Though Crowley is past the 7°=4 ° grade, he is told he has not even the first letter of the for­mula now introduced. Crowley experimented with various solutions for this puzzle. (His footnote from THE EQUINOX is merely a first effort.) No de­finitive answer has been proffered. We offer the following as a possible solution of this first Qabalistic puzzle of this vision: Many words of four letters contain \"all the mystery of the Tet­ragrammaton,\" if for no other reason than that Qabalists tend to correlate four-letter words with the four elements. Of these, there is one that particularly fits the criteria given here. It is n:n::>, Paroketh, the veil before the Holy of Holies. (It literally means \"a curtain.\") In the Portal ritual of the Golden Dawn, through which Crowley had passed, not only were the letters of n::>1:J attributed to the four elements directly, but also the word was communicated in a fashion that mingled its letters with those of rl1i1' in the form rr n 1 :J i1 1' ::>. Therefore, n::>1:J is a four-lettered word that literal­ly contains \"all the mystery of the Tetragrammaton,\" because it is used in a formula wherein it contains Tetragrammaton itself. Now, when n::>1:J is thus merged with rl1i1', their total is 726, the value of the important seven-lettered word �l7'1n'1, VITRIOL (which also was significant in the Portal ritual in Crowley's time). Most commonly meaning sulfuric acid, vitriol is a Medieval al­chemical term broadly referring to a universal solvent, especially one used to extract gold from its surrounding impurities. Does VITRIOL, in tum, conceal \"the holy word that is the key of the abyss\"? Yes, it does. We already know that the word that is key to the Abyss is N.O.X., spelled with Hebrew letters so that it adds to 210. V.I.T.R.I.O.L. is the notariqon of a phrase meaning, \"Journey to the center of the earth; by rectification thou shalt find the Hidden Stone.\" It speaks of that golden truth buried in our inmost center. The word naturally breaks into three parts: V.I. T. 1 These words are probably BABALON, ChAOS, TARO.-AC"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"376 Visions & Voices for the primary sentence; O.L. for the object, \"Hidden Stone;\" and, buried in the center of the word, the letters R.I., or '1, \"by recti­fication thou shalt find,\" which total 210! Additionally, '1 is an actual Hebrew word meaning \"rushing water.\" Is there any further confirmation of this solution in the pas­sage? Yes, there is. After posing the puzzle, the angel said, \"And this thou shalt find, revolving it in thy mind.\" The two parts of �lJ'1n'1 between which '1 is sandwiched are �lJ-= 100, the val­ue of rp, Kaph, the Wheel in Tarot; and -n'1 = 416, for which Crowley's published gematria catalogue, Sepher Sephiroth, gives only one substantial entry: 11i11i1, \"thought, meditation.\" Thus, \"revolve it in thy mind.\" There is a further substantiation that n:>1:J is a word of momen­tous significance at precisely this juncture, and that it also may serve as \"the key to the gate of the evening star.\" Although Paro­keth has a history of being sacramentally used as the name of the veil before Tiphereth, it is properly the name of the veil before the Holy of Holies.1 It is formed of the first three Double (planetary) Letters traversed at the base of the Tree of Life (n, 1, :J), and of the fourth Double Letter, Kaph, ::>,further up the Tree. That is, the full word n::>1:J is not \"built\" within us until we attain to Chesed, immediately before the threshold of the Abyss. Finally, the text of the vision draws particular attention to the first letter of the key word that unlocks \"the gate of the evening star\" (Venus). It takes no adept in sexual mysteries to understand that the key that is inserted into and unlocks the \"gate ofVenus\" is Mars, attributed to the letter ::l ... the first letter ofn::>1:J. 4. Hide therefore thine eyes. And I will set my l:?ey in the loci:?, and open it. Yet still let thine eyes be hidden, for thou canst not bear the glory that is within. 5. So, therefore, I covered mine eyes with my hands. Yet through my hands could I perceive a little of those bowers of az­ure flame. 1 Traditional rituals treat the Vault of the Adepts in Tiphereth as this Holy of Holies; but the holiest of holy places within us is a receding goal, drawing deeper within as we progress. For example, the Golden Dawn rituals also refer­enced Yesod as the Holy ofHolies at its own level. The same idea then appears again, and primarily, before Tiphereth; and we encounter it once more at the threshold of the Supemals, the real Holy of Holies of the Tree ofLife. 6.

Daleth is the \"bar,\" or footrest, ofKether. Compare the \"footstool\" mentioned in the 9th .tEthyr and in § 12 below. The blue ocean of fire is the Queen Scale color of Daleth, and shows Venus as she who was born from the sea, yet whose nature is of fire. 7. Now I behold more fully: Each tongue of flame, each leaf of flame, each flower of flame, is one of the great love-stories of the world, with all its retinue of mise-en-scene. And now there is a most marvellous rose formed from the flame, and a perpetual rain of lilies and passion-flowers and violets. And there is gath­ered out of it all, yet identical with it, the form of a woman libe the woman in the Apocalypse, but her beauty and her radiance are such that one cannot loob thereon, save with sidelong glanc­es. I enter immediately into trance. It seems that it is she of whom it is written, \"The fool hath said in his heart 'there is no God.'\" But the words are not Ain Elohim, but La (=nay!) and Elohim con­tracted from 86 to 14, because La is 31, which x 14 is 434, Daleth, Lamed, Tau. This fool is the fool of the Path of Aleph, and sayeth, which is Chobmah, in his heart, which is Tiphereth, that she ex­isteth, in order first that the Wisdom may be joined with the Un­derstanding; and he affirmeth her in Tiphereth that she may be fertile. Venus themes continue, themes oflove and beauty. In the Qabalis­tic analysis, the usual \"no God,\" Cl'il?� 1'�, is replaced by Cl'il?� �? treated as 31 x 14 = 434 = n?1, Daleth. The rest is clear on its own terms, remembering only that Tiphereth is the child and Da­leth joins Chokmah (Wisdom) with Binah (Understanding). 8. It is impossible to describe how this vision changeth from glory unto glory, for at each glance the vision is changed. And this is because she transmitteth the Word to the Understanding, and therefore hath she many forms, and each goddess of love is but a letter of the alphabet of love. The paths are dynamic, being transition processes between two se­phiroth (as 1 flows between Chokmah, \"the Word,\" and Binah,"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"378 Visions & Voices \"the Understanding\"). On one hand, this makes the paths unstable; on the other, they are sources of enormous energies, and therefore usually more suitable for magical purposes than the sephiroth. 9. Now, there is a mystery in the word Logos, that containeth the three letters whose analogy hath been shown in the lower heav­ens, Samech, and Lamed, and Gimel, that are 93, which is thrice 31, and in them are set the two eyes of Horus. (Ayin means an eye.) For, if it were not so, the arrow could not pierce the rain­bow, and there could be no poise in the balance, and the Great Boob should never be unsealed. But this is she that poureth the Water of Life upon her head, whence it floweth to fructify the earth. But now the whole JEthyr is the most brilliant peacocb blue. It is the Universal Peacocb that I behold. 10. And there is a voice: Is not this bird the bird of Juno, that is an hundred, and thirty, and six? And therefore is she the mate of Jupiter.1 The consonants of logos, LGS or Ol\",, total 93. The two O's are A'ayins, \"eyes\": the Sun and Moon as \"eyes of heaven.\" The par­agraph describes the dysfunction that would prevail absent these \"eyes\" for the arrow of 0, the balance of\",, and the Scroll of Wis­dom of l. Somehow (it is not, at first, clear how), this became converted to an image of the Star card, Atu XVII, that then erupted in brilliant peacock blue (one of the colors of its own scale). The connection to the water-carrying woman - the jump in Crowley's mental associations from these \"two eyes\" - only makes sense once we remember that he was staying in a place called W'ain-t-Aissha, \"the eyes of Jesus,\" named for two water wells that were the center of this little desert community. The peacock is sacred to Juno. If spelled with Hebrew letters, Juno is l7J1' = 136, one of the four great numbers of Jupiter (4, 16, 34, 136); she is his feminine expression. Furthermore, to the an­cient Romans, Juno was the ruler of Aquarius. 11. And now the peacocb's head is again changed into a woman's head sparbling and coruscating with its own light of gems. 12.

An appearance by the \"Black Brothers\" (here and in §§20-24). The description may be studied with a mixture of humor and hor­ror. They deny the Abyss and shut themselves off from life in an ego-protective rigidity. Even love, as their excuse, does not re­deem them. 15. Each plume of the peacocb is full of eyes, that are at the same time 4 x 7. And for this is the number 28 reflected down into Net­zach; and that 28 is l<aph Cheth (l<ach), power. For she is Sabti, the eternal energy of the Concealed One. And it is her eternal energy that hath made this eternal change. And this explaineth the call of the JEthyrs, the curse that was pronounced in the be­ginning being but the creation of Sabti. And this mystery is re­flected in the legend of the Creation, where Adam represents the Concealed One, for Adam is Temurah of MAD, the Enochian word for God, and Eve, whom he created for love, is tempted by the snabe, Nechesh, who is Messiah her child. And the snabe is the magical power, which hath destroyed the primordial equilibrium. 16. And the garden is the supernal Eden, where is Ayin, 70, the Eye of the concealed One, and the creative Lingam; and Daleth, love; and Nun the serpent. And therefore this constitution was implicitly in the nature of Eden (cf. Liber L., 1., 29, 30), so that the call of the JEthyrs could not have been any other call than that which it is. n::>, koach, means \"power.\" By a numerical association with Venus (n::> = 28 = .L(l-7)), it refers to Shakti, or Teh, \"eternal energy\" as a feminine idea."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"380 Visions & Voices We then examine the word 1137, Eden, noting that its letters, re­spectively, describe Adam (37), Eve (1), and the Serpent (J). The basic cast of the Eden myth was built right into the name of the garden. This triad is archetypal: It might be Osiris, Isis, and Apophis, or Red Rose, White Rose, and Black Dragon, &c. All are variations of our longest running sitcom, \"A Guy, a Gal & a Snake.\" The snake is 'tVnJ = 358 = n�wr.J, Messiah, the Anointed One. The Serpent IS the Savior, and is royal.

Numerous Golden Dawn diagrams depict Eden as the Super­nals. 17. But they that are without understanding have interpreted all this asl:?ew, because of the Mystery of the Abyss, for there is no Path from Binah unto Chesed; and therefore the course of the Flaming Sword was no more a current, but a spar!:?. And when the Stooping Dragon raised his head unto Daath in the course of that spar!:?, there was, as it were, an explosion, and his head was blasted. And the ashes thereof were dispersed throughout the whole of the 10th JEthyr. And for this, all l:?nowledge is piecemeal, and it is of no value unless it be co-ordinated by Understanding. 18. And now the form of the JEthyr is the form of a mighty Ea­gle of ruddy brass.

Now again I see those wandering souls, that have sought restrict­ed love, and have not understood that \"the word of sin is re­striction.\" Brass is a copper alloy. Hebrew Biblical passages translated \"brass\" usually mean \"copper.\" \"Ruddy brass\" sounds like copper itself, or a copper-heavy alloy.

And a voice sounds: It is most terrible for the one that hath shut himself up and made himself fast against the universe.

And yet again it is written: He desireth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should turn from his wicbedness. Now, if one of these were to cast off his cloab he should behold the bril­liance of the lady of the JEthyr; but they will not. 25. And yet again there is another cause wherefore He hath permitted them to enter thus far within the frontiers of Eden, so that His thought should never swerve from compassion. But do thou behold the brilliance of Love, that casteth forth seven stars upon thine head from her right hand, and crowneth thee with a crown of seven roses. Behold! She is seated upon the throne of turquoise and lapis lazuli, and she is libe a flawless emerald, and upon the pillars that support the canopy of her throne are sculp­tured the Ram, and the Sparrow, and the Cat, and a strange fish. Behold! How she shineth! Behold! How her glances have bindled all these fires that have blown about the heavens! Yet remember that in every one there goeth forth for a witness the justice of the Most High. Is not Libra the House of Venus? And there goeth forth a sicble that shall reap every flower. Is not Saturn exalted in Libra? Daleth, Lamed, Tau. In this paragraph, we find mostly simple Venus symbols; but the four creatures on the pillars of her throne's canopy crudely repre­sent the four elements. Crowley wrote that they are all sacred to this goddess (which is probably stretching things a bit).

And therefore was he a fool who uttered her name in his heart, for the root of evil is the root of breath, and the speech in the silence was a lie. 27. Thus is it seen from below by them that understand not. But from above he rejoiceth, for the joy of dissolution is ten thou­sand, and the pang of birth but a little. Compare this to Nuit's words inLiber L., 1:29-30: 29For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union. 30This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all. 28. And now thou shalt go forth from the JEthyr, for the voice of the JEthyr is hidden and concealed from thee because thou hadst not the l:?ey of the door thereof, and thine eyes were not able to bear the splendour of the vision. But thou shalt meditate upon the mysteries thereof, and upon the lady of the JEthyr; and it may be by the wisdom of the Most High that the true voice of the JEthyr, that is continual song, may be heard of thee.

Saturn dominated the Midheaven as this vision began. Venus rapidly approached the western horizon. Both Sidereal and Tropical astrologers would have viewed the Moon as being in Scorpio; and in the Sidereal Zodiac, both luminaries were so placed. The depth, darkness, and sulfurous intensity of these Scor­pio luminaries are clearly visible in the vision, enhanced by the o'ershadowing Saturn. Yet, amidst this, perhaps the two most important astrological considerations are factors of Aleister Crowley's own horoscope. His natal Sun was near the IC when he began this vision, just as it had been at his pre-midnight birth; and transiting Mercury exactly squared his Moon. The weakening light of the lunar phase (just two days shy of a pending solar eclipse), combined with the ego reinforcing and intellect-exacerbating transits of that night, had a dual effect. (a) He had difficulty getting deeply into the vision at all. ([J) He primarily saw mental illusions of the Ape of Thoth, the rattletrap machine-monkey of his own mind. Crowley viewed this as primarily a Mercurial vision: specifically, a vision of Chokmah as the higher Mercury. Saturn's presence contributes the heaviness and difficulty.

' The Cry of the 6th .tEthyr MAZ 385 In the scheme that we have followed throughout this series for correlating the cethyrs to the Tree of Life, this 6th .tEthyr corre­sponds to Tiphereth in Atziluth. By the alternate scheme intro­duced in the 9th Aire, the 6th, 5th, and 4th .tEthyrs correspond to Chokmah. This alternate scheme is evident: this is utterly a vision of Chokmah. These three cethyrs now beginning foreshadow the 9°=2° Grade of Magus which Crowley had not yet attained. He was being introduced to its mysteries to the extent then possible. But there are Tiphereth elements as well. Besides the common interchange of attributions and ideas between Mercury and Sol, Tiphereth symbols also appear in § 7, and an essential doctrine of Tiphereth is conveyed in § 11. (This may, of course, be contributed by the Z, or Sun-Leo, in MAZ.) MAZ or [2� =Aquarius, Taurus, Leo. It enumerates to 40 + 1 + 8 = 48. Foremost, this is the value of::J:n::>, kokav, which lit­erally means \"star,\" but is also the proper name of the planet Mer­cury.1 This is dead on! It captures most of the obvious themes of the vision. The astrological correspondences of these three letters are three of the four Kerubic (Fixed or Hub) constellations, corresponding to the Hebrew letters il, 1, 'D. Since 1, Taurus, is the Hebrew con­junction \"and,\" MAZ depicts the union of Heh and Teth, \"Aquari­us and Leo,\" the alchemical Eagle and Lion, Babalon and the Beast, &c. This interpretation does not show as clearly here as in the 4th .tEthyr, where the union of the Sun and Moon is shown. Nonetheless, all three of these cethyrs corresponding to the passage of Chokmah (6t\\ 5th, 4th) have names inferring this type of union of opposites intervening, transcendent, linking third (or \"child\") principle, just as the Divine Name ofChokmah, il', Yah, is a union ofthe primal Father and Mother letters, Yod and Heh. In MAZ, the individual letter attributions show in various plac­es as we move through the Vision. 1. There cometh into the stone the great Angel whose name is Ave, and in him there are symbols which strive for mastery, -Sulphur and the Pentagram, and they are harmonized by the SvastiRa. These symbols are found both in the name of Ave and in the name of the tEthyr. Thus he is neither Horus nor Osiris. He is 1 It is the star of 48 rays added to the hood of the Practicus A:.A:. robe."},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"386 Visions & Voices called the radiance of Thoth; and this J.Ethyr is very hard to un­derstand, for the images form and dissolve more rapidly than lightning. These images are the illusions made by the Ape of Thoth. And this I understand, that I am not worthy to receive the mysteries of this J.Ethyr. And all this which I have seen (being all the thoughts that I have ever thought) is, as it were, a guardian of the J.Ethyr. At once, we open with a Qabalistic analysis, characteristic of the Mercury-to-Moon transit in Crowley's horoscope. Ave is the name of one of the more important angels that communicated with Dr. Dee. The name, which was extracted with other angelic names from the important 7 x 7 tablet reproduced in the discussion of the 22nd .tEthyr, is also the Latin word for \"Hail!\" or \"Hello.\" Argua­bly, Ave was, himself, a dispatched greeting to Dee and Kelley from the Enochian hierarchy. Crowley saw this angel and this rethyr both corresponding to \"Sulphur and the Pentagram ... harmonized by the Svastika.\" By the astrological correspondences of MAZ, fiery Leo is Sulphur, Taurus is the Pentagram (as Atu V), and Aquarius implies the Svastika because (a) this is the classic posture of the figure in Atu XVII, The Star; (/3) it is the shape of the corresponding magical pose, called Isis in Mourning; and (y) the Svastika used as a magi­cal symbol in the Golden Dawn was formed of 17 squares excised from a 25-square matrix: 7 s 3 5 9 10 11 13 15 These attributes also appear in the name Ave, treated as He­brew correspondences to the Old LEon's slightly flawed Tarot model: i11� =The Fool (� is roughly in the shape of a Svastika), The Hierophant (Atu V for the Pentagram, again), and The Em­peror (fiery Aries, and in the shape of 4', Sulphur). as the Kerux, 1 w 2.

From these symbols, Crowley then interpreted the messenger Ave as \"the radiance ofThoth.\" His reasoning is absurd-which is a good sign! Intuition is kicking in. The earlier Qabalistic musings can be lumped in with other \"illusions by the Ape ofThoth.\" He confirms that this rethyr is \"beyond his grade.\" (It is of Chokmah. He had only attained to Binah.) His racing thoughts act as the Kerux/ warding the inner side of the rethyr's doorway. 2. I seem quite helpless. I am trying all sorts of magical methods of piercing the veil: and the more I strive, the farther away I seem to get from success. But a voice comes now: Must not under­standing lie open unto wisdom as the pyramids lie open to the stars? Finally, the Voice comes clearly: Binah must lie open unto Chok­mah as the pyramids (the City of Pyramids of Binah) lie open to the circle of stars that is the astronomical field of operation of Chokmah. This voice stabilized him - fixed his volatility, to use the alchemical term-opening a vision of the Fixed Mercury. 3. Accordingly, I wait in a certain magical posture which it is not fitting to disclose, and above me appears the starry heaven of night, and one star greater than all the other stars. It is a star of eight rays. I recognize it as the star in the seventeenth l:?ey of the Tarot, as the Star of Mercury. And the light of it cometh from the path of Aleph. And the letter Cheth is also involved in the inter­pretation of this star, and the paths of he and vau are the sep­arations which this Star unites. And in the heart of the star is an exceeding splendour, - a god standing upon the moon, brilliant beyond imagining. It is lil:?e unto the vision of the Universal Mer­cury. But this is the Fixed Mercury, and he and vau are the per­fected sulphur and salt. But now I am come into the centre of the maze, a whirling dust of stars and great forgotten gods.

Is not thrice seventeen fifty-one, that is, fail­ure and pain? 4. Now I am shut out again by this blacl:? Svastil:?a with a co-rona of fire about it. The starry nocturnal sky represents both Chokmah, and the M (Aquarius) of MAZ. This corresponds to the path of i1, one of the paths crossed in the initiation of Chokmah. 1 He blended these ide­as with that of kokav, which is both \"star\" and \"Mercury,\" and is here a symbol of Chokmah (the stellar field and the \"higher Mer­cury\"). Cheth, n, is \"involved in the interpretation\" simply because it is the numeral 8 and the initial of ilrJ:Jn, Chokmah. The \"Vision of the Universal Mercury\" is a Golden Dawn paper that portrays Mercury descending upon a great sea, generally understood as the path of Beth, ::J, descending upon Binah. i1 and , are only Sulphur and Salt in the old Tarot scheme, where they are The Emperor (Aries) and The Hierophant (Taurus), respectively. (He returns to the prior idea here.) In their midst, the swirling Svastika is a galaxy-like spiral maze of stars and gods, in­to the center of which he is drawn. 2 5. And a voice cries: Cursed be he that shall uncover the nal:?ed­ness of the Most High, for he is drunl:?en upon the wine that is the blood of the adepts. And BABALON hath lulled him to sleep up­on her breast, and she hath fled away, and left him nal:?ed, and she hath called her children together, saying: Come up with me, and let us mal:?e a moe!:? of the nal:?edness of the Most High. Numerous ideas from this vision were later synthesized in the Class A document, Liber B vel Magi, written down by Crowley about two years later. (See Appendix C.) One of these ideas is that of the \"curse\" of the Grade of Magus. Here, a legend of Chokmah and Binah is woven into a variation of the legend of Noah's drunkenness, from Genesis 10. The son who mocked Noah's na­kedness was Ham, en= 48, the value ofMAZ. 1 The Path of 1 was the invocation of the H.G.A. in the gth .tEthyr. 1 was trav­ersed in the Venus-themed 71h .tEthyr. 2 This Svastika is the \"admission badge\" of the old 1 = 10 Grade, and a symbol ofKether.

And the third of the adepts made a mocb of His na­bedness, walbing forwards; and was blacb. And these are three great schools of the Magi, who are also the three Magi that jour­neyed unto Bethlehem; and because thou hast not wisdom, thou shalt not bnow which school prevaileth, or if the three schools be not one. For the Blacb Brothers lift not up their heads thus far into the Holy Chobmah, for they were all drowned in the great flood, which is Binah, before the true vine could be planted upon the holy hill of Zion. From this story comes the doctrine of the Three Schools of Mag­ick: the White, the Yell ow, and the Black. There is no better dis­cussion of this (and nearly no other discussion of this) than the three letters on this topic in Crowley's Magick Without Tears. The doctrine of the Three Schools of Magick is one way to categorize the varied philosophical and practical schools emerging from the Third Order during humanity's history. These colors are not racial terms, and \"the Black School of Magick\" is not to be confused with either \"the School of Black Magick\" or the \"Black Brothers.\" Representative examples of the White, Yellow, and Black schools, respectively, are Rosicrucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. See the Magick Without Tears letters for more details. In comment to the vision's question of whether \"the three schools be not one,\" Crowley later confirmed, \"They are.\" Zion in the last sentence is the Hebrew 11'� = 156, the same as Babalon and other important words (see 156 in Appendix A). This is one of many clues that \"Zion\" is a specific reference to Binah, an interpretation that fits well with the passage above. 7. Now again I stand in the centre, and all things whirl by with incessant fury. And the thought of the god entereth my mind, and I cry aloud: Behold, the volatile is become fixed; and in the heart of eternal motion is eternal rest. So is the Peace beneath the sea that rageth with her storms; so is the changeful moon, the dead planet that revolveth no more.

And by virtue of my speech is he wrapped about in silence, and he is wrapped in mystery by me, who am the Unveiler of the Myster­ies. And although I be truth, yet do they call me rightly the God of Lies, for speech is two-fold, and truth is one. Yet I stand at the centre of the spider's web, whereof the golden filaments reach to infinity. This is a dynamic sensory expression of the doctrine that 2=9 and 9=2; i.e., that change is stability, and stability change. The volatile has become fixed not by stillness, but by the imperturbability of its incessant motion. \"Hawk\" is a symbol of Kether, and \"ibis\" of Chokmah (via Thoth). Chokmah speaks of its relationship to Kether, as of speech to silence. \"Speech is two-fold [Chokmah, sephirah 2], and truth is one [Kether, sephirah 1].\" Furthermore, there are important mysteries of Chokmah in the sign in which Thoth stands (which Thoth is figuratively giving down the Tree of Life, Kether to his back). Tiphereth symbols appear next. The spider is attributed to Tiphereth, especially because the eight legs remind us of the eight paths into Tiphereth on the Tree of Life. The \"web,\" in this case, is the web of thought (Ruach). It is composed of \"golden filaments\" reaching to infinity. (Yet Arachne's myth also is an expression of the Mysteries of Athena, i.e., Wisdom or Chokmah.) 8.

For I am the inmost guardian that is immedi­ately before the shrine. Crowley is reminded that he hasn't the full Grade for this vision, so there are things he will not see. \"Run and return\" is an im­portant Rabbinical Kabbalistic phrase, based on Ezekiel 1: 14, \"And the Chayoth [the angels of Kether] running and returning, like the appearance of lightning.\" In Sepher Yetzirah 1:6, the word used for \"running\" is ��1, ratzah, which means both \"to run\" and \"to will.\" The phrase is used to introduce the image of the Light­ning Flash to the design of the Tree of Life: Ten ineffable sephiroth: Their mystical image is like the lightning flash.

None shall pass by me except he slay me, and this is his curse, that, having slain me, he must tabe my office and become the maber of Illusions, the great deceiver, the setter of snares; he who baffleth even them that have understanding. For I stand on eve­ry path, and turn them aside from the truth by my words, and by my magic�? arts. 10. And this is the horror that was shown by the lobe that was nigh unto the City of the Seven Hills, and this is the Mystery of the great prophets that have come unto manbind. Moses, and Bud­dha, and Lao Tan, and Krishna, and Jesus, and Osiris, and Mo­hammed; for all these attained unto the grade of Magus, and therefore were they bound with the curse of Thoth. But, being guardians of the truth, they have taught nothing but falsehood, except unto such as understood; for the truth may not pass the Cote of the Abyss. Now comes a description of a \"horror\" compared to certain cus­toms from the early .tEon of Osiris. It is the \"curse\" of the Grade of Magus later hinted in Liber Magi (Appendix C). Despite Crow­ley's exposure to it in this vision, it seems to have fled his memory; for he recorded the terrible actuality of it again, years later, during his initiation to the 9°=2° Grade, as if exposed to it for the first time. In his diary, he wrote: The meditation of this afternoon resulted in an initiation so stu­pendous that I dare not hint at its Word. It is the supreme secret of a Magus, and it is so awful that I tremble even now - two hours later and more ... In a single instant I had the Key to the whole of the Chinese wisdom. In the light ... of this truth, all systems of re­ligion and philosophy became absolutely puerile. Even the Law [of The lema] appears no more than a curious incident. I remain absolutely bewildered, blinded, knowing what blasting image lies in this shrine. It baffles me to understand how my brother Magi, knowing this, ever went on ... This experience has shaken me ut-1 For further details, see Sepher Yetzirah: The Book of Formation, translated and annotated by James A. Eshelman.

I could write it plainly in a few words of one syllable, and most people would not even notice it. But it has might to hurl eve­ry Master of the Temple into the Abyss, and to fling every adept of the Rose Cross down to the Qliphoth. No wonder One said that the Book Twas in ashes in the Urn of a Magus! And so on. I only wanted to give a few lines hinting at the enormi­ty of the impact on him when he later encountered it, for compari­son to what is written here. The rest of § 10 explains the doctrine later enunciated in Liber Magi, which, most simply, is that duality is inherent in all articu­lated doctrine so that, no matter what truth is declared, it is a bab­ble of falsehood. One must be of Binah, wherein an identity (ra­ther than separation) of opposites is understood, in order not to distort and lose it. Truth cannot abide in reason. 11. But the reflection of the truth hath been shown in the lower Sephiroth. And its balance is in Beauty, and therefore have they who sought only beauty come nearest to the truth. For the beau­ty receiveth directly three rays from the supernals, and the others no more than one. So, therefore, they that have sought after majesty and power and victory and learning and happiness and gold, have been discomfited. And these sayings are the lights of wisdom that thou mayst Rnow thy Master, for he is a Magus. And because thou didst eat of the Pomegranate in hell, for half the year art thou concealed, and half the year revealed. This paragraph expresses an essential doctrine of Tiphereth. Once we get past dualistic thinking, there is nothing to recommend beauty any more than ugliness, except this: That to adhere to Beauty as one's guide is to bring oneself closer to the essence of that which is sought. It is pragmatic. \"Success is your proof.\" To argue against this on logical grounds is to miss the point. It works, so do it! 12. Now I perceive the Temple that is the heart of this IEthyr; it is an Urn suspended in the air, without support, above the centre of a well. And the well hath eight pillars, and a canopy above it, and without there is a circle of marble paving-stones, and with­out them a great outer circle of pillars.

And this is that mystery which is spol:?en of in the Acts of the Apostles; that Jupiter and Mercury (Kether and Chol:?mah) visited (that is, inspired), Ephesus, the City of Diana, Binah - was not Diana a bloc!:? stone? - and they burnt their bool:?s of magic!:?. The initiate of Chokmah is given the symbol of the Urn. This is complementary to the symbol of the Pyramid given to the initiate of Binah.1 The symbols given here are very beautiful and deep im­ages of Chokmah. The Urn is also the burial urn of the Magus, created to hold the fine white ash that is all remaining of the con­sumed Magister. The Book Tarot is one of the Magus' chief magi­cal tools: it also refers to the circle of 22 Hebrew letters that, in combination, open the 231 Gates of Chokmah known to Qabalists. The Hermetic-Qabalistic spelling of Tarot is l71�n = 671. The \"Book Tarot\" is, therefore, l71�n 1::>0 = 1,011. This is also the value of Cl1iln, tehoom, the Abyss. (The true value of Tarot is be­yond reason.) Consider this in the context of the present vision. 14. Now it seems that the centre of infinite space is that Urn, and Hadit is the fire that hath burnt up the boo!:? Tarot. For in the boo!:? Tarot was preserved all of the wisdom (for the Tarot was called the Boo!:? of Thoth), of the JEon that is passed. And in the Boo!:? of Enoch was first given the wisdom of the New JEon. And it was hidden for three hundred years, because it was wrested untimely from the Tree of Life by the hand of a desperate magi­cian. For it was the Master of that Magician who overthrew the power of the Christian church; but the pupil rebelled against the master, for he foresaw that the New (i.e., the Protestant) would be worse than the Old. But he understood not the purpose of his Master, and that was, to prepare the way for the overthrowing of the JEon. By \"the Book of Enoch\" he meant the Enochian angelical commu­nications originally received 300 years before his own time. This is one of several places where the Enochian teachings are said to be an early attempt to communicate the Law of The1ema to a hu-1 To Binah, the Mother, is given a symbol cognate with the phallus, while to Chokmah, the Father, is given a symbol ofthe kteis."},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"394 Visions & Voices manity not yet ready for it. Crowley believed the \"desperate magi­cian\" to be Edward Kelley, John Dee's assistant. The \"Master\" cited was Martin Luther. 15. There is a writing upon the Urn of which I can but read the (two) words: Stabat Crux juxta Lucem. Stabat Lux juxta Crucem. \"The Cross stands by the Light\" and \"The Light stands by the Cross.\" Their numeration by the Latin Qabalah Simplex, 230, has no apparent significance. But the eight initials, S.C.I.L. S.L.I.C., enumerate to 78, the number of cards in the Tarot, which § 14 said were burned up therein. 16. And there is writing in GreeR above that. The word 'nox' writ­ten in GreeR, and a circle with a cross in the centre of it, a St. An­drew's cross. A St. Andrew's cross is an X. This, within a circle, is the ensign of the word N.O.X. with which we have become familiar. (See the il­lustration below of how the letters N, 0, and X are derived from the X within the circle.) 17. Then above that is a sigil (?),hidden by a hand. N.O.X. enumerates to 210. (See 210 in Appendix A.) This is the mystic number of the 20th Path of the Tree of Life, corresponding to', Yod: I(l-20) = 210. The hand that hides it is the meaning of Y od. The veil is what it veils; that is, what Crowley could not see (being not an initiate of Chokmah) was a symbol meaning much the same thing as the letter Y od. 18. And a voice proceedeth from the Urn: From the ashes of the Tarot who shall maRe the phoenix-wand? Not even he who by his understanding hath made the lotus-wand to grow in the Great Sea.

I am, there­fore, limited to explaining the relevance of their outer forms. The R.R. etA. C., at the time of Crowley's initiation to 5=6, assigned a lotus-headed wand to an officer corresponding to Tiphereth; a phoenix-headed wand to an officer corresponding to 6=5; and a wand topped by a winged globe to the Chief Adept, corresponding to 7=4. But these are actually reflections downward from the Su­pemals: On inspection, these symbols are seen to be those of Bi­nah, Chokmah, and Kether, respectively (which, in fact, are the lo­cations of the officers' thrones in the 5=6 sanctuary). Thus, the phoenix wand, with all of the rising-anew-from-fire phoenix sym­bolism, belongs to Chokmah, as the lotus wand to \"the Great Sea\" ofBinah. The mystery of atheism will be disclosed in the Cry of the 5th JEthyr. The end of § 18 is quite interesting. It was likely true that, in Crowley's personal psychological patterns, he had \"violated his mother\" but had not yet slain his adoring projections on his father. This had yet to occur. 19. Then again arose the Cod Thoth, in the sign of the Enterer, and he drove the seer from before his face. And he fell through the starry night unto the little village in the desert. Note that the \"starry night\" was probably not literally (physically) true. The day had been stormy, and it is unlikely the sky was clear. It is the star field of Chokmah, and of the path of Heh, i1, through which he fell, cast back down the Tree by the force of a stream of primal life-fire, flowing through Thoth as He stood before the Crown in a sign of the projection of Light.

It is the Sidereal Zodiac. The central feature of the Cry of the 5th JEthyr is the Vision of the Arrow. On December 12, Crowley essayed the rethyr. He was denied the Vision of the Arrow, and told to return the next day. This he did, and got the vision. On December 12, in the Tropical Zodiac, the Moon was in Sag­ittarius, sign of the Arrow, and combined with a Sagittarian Sun in the most powerful astrological combination the Moon could have, a solar eclipse. But, by December 13, when Crowley was given the Vision of the Arrow, she had moved on to Tropical Capricorn. However, on December 12, in the Sidereal Zodiac, the Moon, in her syzygy, was still in Scorpio. It was not until after 2:00 a.m. on the 13th that the Moon entered Sagittarius, where she remained the next evening. In the Sidereal Zodiac, the Moon-sign correctly identified the day the Vision of the Arrow would be received. The Tropical also conveyed a clear answer, but the answer was clearly wrong. The symbolism of the Arrow is unambiguously related to Sagittarius. It is the central feature of the vision, not a minor side detail. Besides the lunar sign, the most important astrological feature of these maps is her phase. On December 12, she was less than an hour from a solar eclipse. Though the eclipse was not visible in"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"398 Visions & Voices North Africa, this does not change the astrological (or, for that matter, astrophysical) impact of the event. A solar eclipse is an ex­act alignment of the Earth, Moon, and Sun- a New Moon-so close that the Moon actually blocks visibility of the Sun. During most New Moons, the Moon is sufficiently north or south of the plane of the ecliptic that she does not block visibility of the Sun at all. Twice a year, though, at New Moon she is close enough -within half a degree of latitude - that the Sun is eclipsed. At those times, the gravitational pull on Earth is at its greatest. Tidal forces surge at their mightiest. Electromagnetic phenomena sizzle. Nerv­ous systems are impacted. It is not clear whether Crowley knew this was happening. Not only did the eclipse occur invisibly at night, but there were heavy rains. Crowley did pay atten­tion to such phenomena, but he had been away from Euro­pean civilization and its me­dia for a few weeks, and may not have noticed this one. Nonetheless, it is rather inter­esting that the angel who greeted him was described as \"black... edged with gold.\" This is a fair description of an eclipsed Sun. (Maximum to­tality of this partial eclipse was at 7:32 p.m. Algerian time, about midway through the first phase of the vision, just as the angel appeared in §8.) In addition to the tremendous surge of psychic and magical en­ergy that the eclipse itself would be expected to unleash, it was, more simply, a New Moon. Magical energies had been waning for days. We would expect that a substantial renewal and empowering would occur now. It did, and this carried him through all of the mighty, majestic visions remaining in the set. At the time Crowley began the work on December 12, transit­ing Mars was exactly on the Midheaven, and his own Mars was exactly setting. We would expect a strong Mars influence, there­fore. I do not find one, however (besides a little bit of huffing and puffing by the dragon midway through).

In this instance, that does not seem to have conditioned the content of the vision at all. Mercury opposed Pluto exactly. They were aligned along the axis of the Galactic Center which, in the Sidereal Zodiac, is at 2°07' Sagittarius.1 Mercury-Pluto aspects indicate penetrating in­tellectual inquiry, a demand for answers at almost any cost. It is the ultimate agnostic, the transcendental inquirer, and in this hour was in alignment with the central axis of our galaxy in a degree marking the head of the archer's arrow. Transiting Venus squared Crowley's Jupiter. It is not clear that this had any impact on the vision. (More likely it accounted for his enjoyment of the spectacular gorge through which they hiked ear­lier in the day.) While continuing the Chokmah theme, this rethyr, additional­ly, corresponded to Geburah in Atziluth. Besides the repeated themes of weaponry and overwhelming force, the central figure of the rethyr's tale is Eros, who is the Hindu god Kama, cognate of the Hebrew '?�r.J::>, Kamrel. LIT or C1J = Cancer, Sagittarius, Dragon's Head. More specifically, Lis the waning Moon; Cancer is simply the zodiacal expression of both waxing and waning lunar ideas. LIT enumer­ates to 30 + 10 + 9 = 49. Not only is this number (7 x 7) strikingly expressive of the ideas of both Babalon and Eros, it also gives us very direct \"hits\" such as 1'?�i1, \"the child,\" and �I'.Jn, \"heat, fury;\" along with more generic Babalon-themed words such as i11'.J1, \"si­lent,\" and l:l1i1, \"the blood.\" Latin provides a wealth of relevant associations for 49, not the least of which, for this vision, are LUX, \"light;\" FANUM, \"temple, shrine;\" and GAUDEO, \"I rejoice.\" The symbolic attributes of each letter of the name LIT also provide many correspondences throughout the vision. Some of these will be mentioned as we proceed. A few remarks seem warranted on the complex symbolism of Caput Draconis, the Dragon's Head, or North Lunar Node. By magical tradition, the Lunar Nodes are invoked using lunar formu­lre. For example, the bottom (or lunar) point of a hexagram is used. Yet the symbolism of Caput in these visions is invariably a great deal more solar than lunar. Probably, Crowley associated a phrase like \"the dragon's head\" with the erect penis. Surely he also 1 In the Tropical Zodiac, in December 1909, it was 25°36' Sagittarius."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"400 Visions & Voices fused to this Enochian T the Leo ideas of the Hebrew T; and, in his handwritten notes, the glyphs for Caput, 66, and Leo, &/_, are not always distinct. This has created much confusion in some editions of The Vision & the Voice. But, also, Caput seems commonly associated (in the symbolism of these visions, not astrologically) with intense kundalini phe­nomena. The Dragon's Head seems to bear the dragon-like attrib­utes of the kundalini serpent. Based on experience in earlier vi­sions, these are some of the characteristics we might expect to en­counter from it in the present vision; and we do. 1. There is a shining pylon, above which is set the sigil of the eye, within the shining triangle. Light streams through the pylon from before the face of lsis-Hathor, for she weareth the lunar crown of cows' horns, with the disR in the centre; at her breast she beareth the child Horus. The vision starts at once. We find ourselves standing before a py­lon surmounted by the shining eye and triangle. This is inherently a symbol of Chokmah, not only because we know it is, but also because the eye is lJ = 70, while the triangle enumerates to 3; and the value ofChokmah, ili'.J:>n, is 73. The lunar crescent is especial­ly a symbol of the L of LIT. 2. And there is a voice: thou Rnowest not how the Seven was united with the Four; much less then canst thou understand the marriage of the Eight and the Three. Yet there is a word wherein these are made one, and therein is contained the Mystery that thou seeRest, concerning the rending asunder of the veil of my Mother. We are given a Qabalistic puzzle, much like the one that opened the Cry of the 7th lEthyr. Crowley seems not to have noticed (as his vision indicated he would not) that the name of the rethyr itself portrays \"the marriage of the Eight and the Three;\" for, in the ge­omancy-derived gematria theory he was using, its letters are those that he enumerated as 8 (L) and 3 (T), joined by a symbol of the \"Chymical Wedding,\" or alchemical union of opposites (I= X' = Atu XIV). All three letters in the name LIT, by the geomancy model, are symbolic of the honeymoon night (\"the rending asun­der of the veil\"), for Cancer, The Chariot, Atu VII, shows \"the presentation of tbe.

Now there is an avenue of pylons (not one alone), steep after steep, carved from the solid roc!:? of the mountain; and that roc!:? is a substance harder than diamond, and brighter than light, and heavier than lead. In each pylon is seated a god. There seems an endless series of these pylons. And all the gods of all the nations of the earth are shown, for there are many avenues, all leading to the top of the mountain. 4. Now I come to the top of the mountain, and the last pylon opens into a circular hall, with other pylons leading out of it, each of which is the last pylon of a great avenue; there seem to be nine such pylons. And in the centre is a shrine, a circular table, supported by marble figures of men and women, alternate white and bloc!:?; they face inwards, and their buttocl:?s are almost worn away by the l:?isses of those who have come to worship that su­preme Cod, who is the single end of all those diverse religions. But the shrine itself is higher than a man may reach. Most basic Chokmah symbols are circles or wheels. This shrine is no different. Its meaning is at once recognizable: It shows innu­merable paths to a mountaintop (the most common symbol of the apex of human spiritual evolution). All paths lead to a common peak and common center. This is one of the most inspiring sym­bols in all of these visions. s. But the Angel that was with me lifted me, and I saw that the edge of the altar, as I must call it, was surrounded by holy men. Each has in his right hand a weapon - one a sword, one a spear, one a thunderbolt, and so on, but each with his left hand gives the sign of silence. I wish to see what is within their ring. One of them bends forward so that I may whisper the pass-word. The Angel prompts me to whisper: \"There is no god.\" So they let me pass, and though there was indeed nothing visible therein, yet there was a very strange atmosphere, which I could not under­stand. 6. Suspended in the air there is a silver star, and on the fore­head of each of the guardians there is a silver star. It is a penta­gram, - because, says the Angel, three and five are eight; three"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"402 Visions & Voices and eight are eleven. (There is another numerical reason that I cannot hear.) 7. And as I entered their ring, they bade me stand in their cir­cle, and a weapon was given unto me. And the pass-word that I had given seems to have been whispered round from one to the other, for each one nods gravely as if in solemn acquiescence, un­til the last one whispers the same words in my ears. But they have a different sense. I had taRen them to be a denial of the existence of God, but the man who says them to me evidently means nothing of the sort: What he does mean I cannot tell at all. He slightly emphasized the word \"there.\" The password in this circle of Magi is, \"There is no god.\" Com­pare Hadit's words in Liber L., Cap. 2, \"I am alone: there is no God where I am\" (v. 23); and, \"In the sphere I am everywhere the center, as she, the circumference, is nowhere found. Yet she shall be known & I never\" (vv. 3-4). Also, the Islamic, \"Allah is the atheist; He has no Allah.\" The Silver Star is, of course, the symbol of the Third Order (S :. S :. ) of A:. A:., given here as a pentagram. 8. And now all is suddenly blotted out, and instead appears the Angel of the JEthyr. He is all in blacR, burnished blacR scales, just edged with gold. He has vast wings, with terrible claws on the ends, and he has a fierce face, liRe a dragon's, and dreadful eyes that pierce one through and through. 9. And he says: 0 thou that art so dull of understanding, when wilt thou begin to annihilate thyself in the mysteries of the JEth­yrs? For all that thou thinRest is but thy thought; and as there is no god in the ultimate shrine, so there is no I in thine own Cosmos. 10. They that have said this are of them that understood. And all men have misinterpreted it, even as thou didst misinterpret it. He says some more: I cannot catch it properly, but it seems to be to the effect that the true God is equally in all the shrines, and the true I in all the parts of the body and the soul. He speaRs with such a terrible roaring that it is impossible to hear the words: one catches a phrase here and there, or a glimpse of the idea. With every word he belches forth smoRe, so that the whole JEthyr be­comes full of it. 11. And now I heari1 forms the smoRe of IIIII among the inhabitanllil forth in my breath. � 12.

And now I hear the Angel: Every particle of matter that forms the smobe of my breath is a religion that hath flourished among the inhabitants of the worlds. Thus are they all whirled forth in my breath. 12. Now he is giving a demonstration of this Operation. And he says: Know thou that all the religions of all the worlds end herein, but they are only the smobe of my breath, and I am only the head of the Great Dragon that eateth up the Universe; without whom the Fifth JEthyr would be perfect, even as the first. Yet un­less he pass by me, can no man come unto the perfections. The angel's colors are of a solar eclipse, but he is essentially a dragon-the Dragon's Head symbolism of the cethyr's name, and of the eclipse. He asks when the seer will truly annihilate himself \"in the mysteries of the JEthyrs.\" (Crowley mostly held himself back in these visions, keeping a link to his Ruach so that he could bring back a record for posterity.) §9 is an observation from Bi­nah's perspective. In§ 10, the \"terrible roaring\" is surely kundalini, represented by this \"dragon\" - a preparation of Crowley for the more intense experience that was to follow the next day. The \"head of the Great Dragon\" in § 12 is, of course, b6, the Tin LIT. 13. And the rule is ended that hath bound thee, and this shall be thy rule: that thou shalt purify thyself, and anoint thyself with perfume; and thou shalt be in the sunlight, the day being free from clouds. And thou shalt mabe the Call of the JEthyr in silence. The method of invoking the cethyrs given in the 9th JEthyr is abro­gated. This new method is of all simplicity. In the style of the best magical ritual, its literals also veil symbolic meanings (which, however, would not benefit from over-interpretation). 14. Now, then, behold how the head of the dragon is but the tail of the JEthyr! Many are they that have fought their way from mansion to mansion of the Everlasting House, and beholding me at last have returned, declaring, \"Fearful is the aspect of the Mighty and Terrible One.\" Happy are they that have bnown me for whom I am. And glory unto him that hath made a gallery of my throat for his arrow of truth, and the moon for his purity. 15. The moon waneth. The moon waneth. The moon waneth.

The arrow is fledged with the plumes of Maat, that are the plumes of Amoun, and the shaft is the phallus of Amoun, the Concealed One. And the barb thereof is the star that thou sawest in the place where was No Cod. The Dragon's Head is the tail of the <ethyr, the last letter in the name LIT. He asserts that he is only one ordeal along the route. The last sentence of § 14 spells the name of the <ethyr backwards, by symbols. The instruction is to enter the mouth of this dragon if we would proceed. § 15 opens with the waning Moon, or L, and the arrow, I. The symbols begin to interweave, and resist simple commentary: For example, notice that two letters in LIT correspond to Samekh and Gimel, two of the three paths on the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life, and the specific two that are most commonly called \"The Path of the Arrow.\" 16. And of them that guarded the star, there was not found one worthy to wield the Arrow. And of them that worshipped there was not found one worthy to behold the Arrow. Yet the star that thou sawest was but the barb of the Arrow, and thou hadst not the wit to grasp the shaft, or the purity to divine the plumes. Now therefore is he blessed that is born under the sign of the Ar­row, and blessed is he that hath the sigil of the head of the crowned lion and the body of the Snal:?e and the Arrow there­with. 17. Yet do thou distinguish between the upward and the downward Arrows, for the upward arrow is straitened in its flight, and it is shot by a firm hand, for Jesod is Jod T etragrammaton, and Jod is a hand, but the downward arrow is shot by the top­most point of the Jod; and that Jod is the Hermit, and it is the mi­nute point that is not extended, that is nigh unto the heart of Had it. Yesod (110�) is the \"Yod-Sod (110-�), or \"secret hand\" (among other ideas). It is called the \"Hand of fl1il',\" which launches the Arrow (Samekh) from the bow (mvp, qesheth, the three lowest paths on the Tree of Life). In The Zohar, it is equated to the phal­lus of the Most High. We are told that this \"arrow of truth\" flies \"true.\" It is straightened in its flight.

And I with­draw myself, covering my face with my wings, before the pres­ence of the Angel of the JEthyr. Crowley returns to the Vision of the 5th LEthyr on the 13th. The so­lar eclipse has passed. The Moon has passed from Scorpio to Sag­ittarius. He is to be introduced to the mystery of the a:thyr. Each of the metaphorical titles given him for this mystery is a poetic reference to his pending kundalini experience (\"ancient Marvel,\" \"winged light,\" \"Fountains of Fire,\" \"Mystery of the Wedge\"). 21. So the Angel departed with bowed head, folding his wings across. 22. And there is a little child in a mist of blue light; he hath golden hair, a mass of curls, and deep blue eyes. Yea, he is all golden, with a living, vivid gold. And in each hand he hath a snal:?e; in the right hand a red, in the left hand a blue. And he hath red sandals, but no other garment."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"408 Visions & Voices This golden child is described in substantially solar symbols; but he is identified later as Eros, which equates him also with Geburah (like the Hindu god Kama). His symbols are those of kundalini, his snakes being Pingala to his right and Ida to his left, the cur­rents ofFire and Water (or Sun and Moon), respectively. 23. And he sayeth: Is not life a long initiation unto sorrow? And is not Isis the Lady of Sorrow? And she is my mother. Nature is her name, and she hath a twin sister Nephthys, whose name is Per­fection. And Isis must be bnown of all, but of how few is Nephthys bnown! Because she is darb, therefore is she feared. 24. But thou who hast adored her without fear, who hast made thy life an initiation into her Mystery, thou that hast nei­ther mother nor father, nor sister nor brother, nor wife nor child, who hast made thyself lonely as the hermit crab that is in the waters of the Great Sea, behold! when the sistrons are shaben, and the trumpets blare forth the glory of Isis, at the end thereof there is silence, and thou shalt commune with Nephthys. The angel declares a mystery of Binah. He contrasts Isis, bright even in her sorrow, with her twin, Nephthys, the dark and un­known aspect of mystery. 25. And having bnown these, there are the wings of Maut the Vulture. Thou mayest draw to an head the bow of thy magical will; thou mayest loose the shaft and pierce her to the heart. I am Eros. Tabe then the bow and the quiver from my shoulders and slay me; for unless thou slay me, thou shalt not unveil the Mystery of the JEthyr. Maut is used to symbolize the oldest, deepest idea of the mother, more primal even than Isis and Nephthys. Beneath her wings, Crowley's task is to slay Eros: to slay not only desire, but that most vital, divine aspect of his desire-force. 'Epo<; = 365, the number of days in a year, which links him to the solar deities Mc:t8pa<; and 'A�pa�a<; (both also total 365). His symbols re­semble those of some images of' A�pa�a<;. 26.

The white arrow had no barb, but the blac� arrow was barbed li�e a forest of fish-hoo�s; it was bound round with brass, and it had been dipped in deadly poison. Then I fitted the white arrow to the string, and I shot it against the heart of Eros, and though I shot with all my force, it fell harmlessly from his side. But at that moment the blac� arrow was thrust through mine own heart. I am filled with fearful agony. 31. And the child smiles, and says: Although thy shaft hath pierced me not, although the envenomed barb hath struc� thee through; yet I am slain, and thou livest and triumphest, for I am thou and thou art I. He must set aside his resistance to slaying this beautiful, innocent child. He asserts that no man can do it. He hears the response that, yes, NEMO (\"No Man,\" the Master of the Temple 8°=3°) can do it! The Latin phrase §29 adds to 186, like the Hebrew 'J1'0J, niss­yoni, \"a test or trial,\" the name of the particular consciousness at­tributed to Samekh, 0, Sagittarius: He is being tested again by the symbolism of the arrow that he must shoot. 186 is also 8£ATJI.la (Thelema) + ayan11 (Agape): There is no division between love and will . The result of his trial is expressed in the paradoxical language of the Supemals, and the reader likely will understand this intui­tively, though it is a rat's nest of confusion to the intellect. 32. With that he disappears, and the A:thyr splits with a roar as of ten thousand thunders. And behold, The Arrow! The plumes of Maat are its crown, set about the dis�. It is the Ateph crown of Thoth, and there is the shaft of burning light, and beneath there is a silver wedge. 33.

Crowley did not report experiencing a kundalini rush, but the images, feelings, sounds, and other sensations are unmistaka­ble. Note that the silver crescent of the Moon (the instinctual force rooted in Yesod) propels this arrow. This crescent is also the astral ensign of the Svadisthana chakra located in the spine behind the lower abdomen, attributed to Mars and Water, and associated with sexuality and all other biologically rooted creative force. 34. I see that the crown of the Arrow is the Father of all Light, and the shaft of the Arrow is the Father of all Life, and the barb of the Arrow is the Father of all Love. For that silver wedge is liRe a lotus flower, and the Eye within the Ateph Crown crieth: I watch. And the Shaft crieth: I worR. And the Barb crieth: I wait. And the Voice of the JEthyr echoeth: It beams. It burns. It blooms. \"It beams. It bums. It blooms.\" Crowley wrote that, \"These are the Words of a certain Grade of A:.

This Arrow is the glance of the Eye of Shiva. But because it moveth not, the universe is not destroyed. The universe is put forth and swallowed up in the quivering of the plumes of Maat, that are the plumes of the Arrow: but those plumes quiver not. 36.

And the Arrow is one, and thou art lost in the Mys­tery, who art but as a babe that is carried in the womb of its mother, that art not yet ready for the light. Several paragraphs follow that contain musings in the \"reversal\" sort of thinking that is characteristic of the Supernals. (So much of this vision defies commentary, so I skip past it. That is, where a comment could be made, it is likely self-evident to the reader.) 39. And the vision overcometh me. My sense is stunned; my sight is blasted; my hearing is dulled. 40. And a voice cometh: Thou didst see� the remedy of sor­row; therefore all sorrow is thy portion. This is that which is writ­ten: \"God hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all.\" For as thy blood is mingled in the cup of BABALON, so is thine heart the universal heart. Vet is it bound about with the Green Serpent, the Serpent of Delight. 41. It is shown me that this heart is the heart that rejoiceth, and the serpent is the serpent of Death, for herein all the symbols are interchangeable, for each one containeth in itself its own op­posite. And this is the great Mystery of the Supernals that are be­yond the Abyss. For below the Abyss, contradiction is division; but above the Abyss, contradiction is Unity. And there could be noth­ing true except by virtue of the contradiction that is contained in itself. The quote in §40 is from Isaiah 53:6. It is preceded, in v. 4, by the relevant: \"Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sor­rows.\" The commingling of the Adept's life with the All (and how much more that of the Master!) is reciprocal. The last two sentenc­es of §40 allude to Liber LXV, 3:18-20, which read, in part: 0 Snake of Emerald, Thou hast no time Past, no time To Come. Verily Thou art not... Also Thy coils are of infinite range; the Heart that Thou dost encircle is an Universal Heart. Do not miss the explanation, in §41, of the difference in con­sciousness above vs. below the Abyss: \"below the Abyss, contra­diction is division; but above the Abyss, contradiction is Unity.\" This is a fundamental concept. It makes plain much in these vi­sions that might otherwise be obscure or indecipherable."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"412 Visions & Voices 42. Thou canst not believe how marvellous is this vision of the Ar­row. And it could never be shut out, except the Lords of Vision troubled the waters of the pool, the mind of the Seer. But they send forth a wind that is a cloud of Angels, and they beat the water with their feet, and little waves splash up - they are mem­ories. For the seer hath no head; it is expanded into the universe, a vast and silent sea, crowned with the stars of night. Vet in the very midst thereof is the arrow. Little images of things that were, are the foam upon the waves. And there is a contest between the Vision and the memories. I prayed unto the Lords of Vision, say­ing: 0 my Lords, tabe not away this wonder from my sight. Read this paragraph for the feelings induced, the point of view ex­perienced.

Rejoice therefore if thou hast been permitted to behold, even for a moment, this Arrow, the austere, the august. But the vision is accomplished, and we have sent forth a great wind against thee. For thou canst not pene­trate by force, who hast refused it; nor by authority, for thou hast trampled it under foot. Thou art bereft of all but understanding, 0 thou that art no more than a little pile of dust! 44. And the images rise up against me and constrain me, so that the JEthyr is shut against me.

Throughout this series, their angularity has been the mark of especially transformative or \"breakthrough\" visions. Venus and the Moon prepared to rise. At the time the vision began, Venus was exactly on the Eastpoint. What could be more suitable for an angular Venus than a vision of rapturous cosmic lovemaking? As the vision progressed, these two planets rose, passing the Ascendant (as best we can judge passage of time with­in the transcript) about the time §§8-14 were being experienced, at the height of the passion. In the intervening three days since the sojourn of the 5th .tEthyr, Luna had continued past her conjunction with the Sun and was, by now, well into her increase. The astral vital energies were again rising, as is evident in the vision. Additionally, Venus was exactly sextile Mars that morning, a further indication of emotional­physical passion and the raptures of the flesh. Furthermore, the Sun was exactly square Crowley's Moon (separating, but still within 1 °). Sun-Moon aspects are as indica­tive of sexual passion as Venus-Mars, and even more indicative of the union of sexual complements. As we shall see below, this idea of the wedding of Sun and Moon is fundamental to this rethyr, re­gardless of who explores it, or when. In the Tropical Zodiac, the Moon was in Aquarius.

Nor is this primarily a vision ofNuit, or even Babalon, but, rather, of her daughter, who is the final Heh in Tetragrammaton. In the Sidereal Zodiac, the Moon is in Capricorn. This is much better! Almost universally, from culture to culture, the goat is a symbol of wild, insatiable lust. The rising of the erotic Moon­Venus pair in Capricorn is a spectacular description of the main event dominating the vision, the nonstop, eternal copulation of ar­chetypal forces. The symbolism is even more precise: § 13 de­scribes coition with a goat (probably just as Venus rose in Capri­corn). The rapture from the beginning, the desolation at the end, and specific references in the midst to the powers of Saturn, ruler of Capricorn, all affirm the Capricornian nature of the vision. One more sign position deserves attention. In the Sidereal zo­diac, the Sun had entered Sagittarius. This differentiates the vi­sions of these final four rethyrs from all that have come before. All of the others had the Sun in Scorpio. Theoretically, we would have regarded the Sun-sign as far too slow changing to have a serious impact on these visions. It is hard to miss, though, the persistent Scorpio themes thus far: sexuality, death, and transformation have been their keynote, often supplemented by images of war and the progressive disclosure of the devouring, sexual, serpentine god­dess Babalon. Obviously, this first Sagittarian vision has no short­age of sexual symbolism! (The Moon's presence in the constella­tion of Mars' exaltation seems to bear the brunt of this, rather than the Sun in Mars' nocturnal home); and we shall certainly see con­tinued unveiling ofBabalon in the visions to come. Nonetheless, it behooves us to be mindful of this change, and to begin watching for a shift, should there be one, from the raw, raging Scorpio, ruled by the god of war, into the more uplifting and civilizing Sagittari­us, associated by astrologers today with Jupiter, and by the an­cients with Artemis-Diana, the goddess of the hunt. This third rethyr of the Chokmah set (6th, 5th, 4th) corresponds also to Chesed of Atziluth. None of the symbols of this vision are classic Chesed symbols, except that the angels in §2 are in the col­ors of Chesed in the Princess Scale. The central image, however -a variation of Shiva and Shakti entwined - is that which I have long regarded to be the Magical Image ofDa'ath. PAZ or [2,?:p =Cancer, Taurus, Leo. It enumerates to 80 + 1 + 7 = 88. In Hebrew, this number corresponds to passionate and"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"416 Visions & Voices fitting words, such as �m, nachal, \"roaring, seething, burning;\" Cli'.Jn, chamam, \"to be hot;\" ��:m, chak'lal, \"redness;\" and Cl::>nJ, kochakem, \"your strength.\" It is also �n, chaph, \"pure, innocent,\" which this orgiastic union most certainly is. Nor should we over­look the rather obvious i1�J.J, nigleh, \"naked.\" In Greek, 88 is the value of VlKll, \"victory,\" synonymous with the Hebrew Netzach, the name of the sphere of Venus. In Latin, among several other in­teresting things, it is VICTORIA-again, \"victory,\" or Netzach, the Venus-associated sephirah embodying the desire force - and AQ­UA VITJE, \"the water of life.\" This is an excellent showing. However, it is in the meaning of the individual letters of the name PAZ that the central symbol of this rethyr stands disclosed. The Enochian letters, remember, are attributed to geomantic fig­ures, which, in turn, are attributed primarily to the planets. The zodiacal correspondences are dual particularizations of the posi­tive and negative modes of each planet. (For review, see the table in the Introduction.) When we say that the Enochian P and L cor­respond to Cancer, we really mean that they are the positive and negative expressions of the Moon, waxing and waning respective­ly. When we say that G and Z correspond to Leo, we really mean that they reflect the positive-negative polarity of the Sun, differen­tiated by whether he has northern (summer) or southern (winter) declination. It is the same with the other planets, each of which is expressed through the \"day\" or \"night\" rulership (the masculine or feminine sign that it rules). Thus, the Enochian A corresponds to Taurus because this is the \"night home\" of Venus. By expressing these letters through the zodiacal signs we get more differentiation of function, a greater richness of symbolism, and thus more magi­cal and psychological vitality. Therefore, the sign symbols are the most commonly employed. But we should not let our common habit cause us to miss the elegant symbolism in this rethyr's name. PAZ shows the Moon (P, 0) and Sun (Z, :P) conjugally joined by \"the night house of Ve­nus,\" Taurus (A, J), which corresponds to the Hebrew letter Vav, 1. The simplest reading of the name PAZ is, \"the Moon and the Sun conjugally joined;\" and the Moon is, more specifically, shown in her positive expression and her increase, as the Sun is shown in his negative, or winter, expression. This detail of their relationship is borne out in the imagery of the vision, wherein the heat of their union has infused each with basic characteristics of the other. o. The Stone is � therein. ·� 1.

A voice says: Behold the brilliance of the Lord, whose feet are set upon him that pardoneth transgression. Behold the six­fold Star that flameth in the Vault, the seal of the marriage of the great White King and his blacl:? slave. Within the topaz of his scrying stone, on the first clear and sunny morning after days of rain, Crowley first saw a brilliant six-fold star: the hexagram, or star of David (lit., of love). It is the t) or 1 (= 6 in Hebrew) in the midst of the name PAZ, uniting the Sun (Z) and the Moon (P), here represented by a White King and Black Queen, variants of European and Tibetan alchemical symbols. 2. So I lool:?ed into the Stone, and beheld the six-fold Star: the whole JEthyr is as tawny clouds, lil:?e the flame of a furnace. And there is a mighty host of Angels, blue and golden, that throng it, and they cry: Holy, Holy, Holy art thou, that art not shal:?en in the earthqual:?es, and in the thunders! The end of things is come upon us; the day of be-with-us is at hand! For he hath created the universe, and overthrown it, that he might tal:?e his pleasure thereupon. These angels, the color of Chesed in the Princess Scale, may be the Chashmalim. They recite a common religious theme concern­ing the rapture of the primary creator-god. 3. And now, in the midst of the JEthyr, I beheld that god. He hath a thousand arms, and in each hand is a weapon of terrible strength. His face is more terrible than the storm, and from his eyes flash lightnings of intolerable brilliance. From his mouth run seas of blood. Upon his head is a crown of every deadly thing. Upon his forehead is the upright tau, and on either side of it are signs of blasphemy. And about him clingeth a young girl, lil:?e un­to the l:?ing's daughter that appeared in the ninth JEthyr. But she is become rosy by reason of his force, and her purity hath tinged his blacl:? with blue. 4. They are clasped in a furious embrace, so that she is torn asunder by the terror of the god; yet so tightly clingeth she about him, that he is strangled. She hath forced bact? his head, and his"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"418 Visions & Voices throat is livid with the pressure of her fingers. Their joint cry is an intolerable anguish, yet it is the cry of their rapture, so that every pain, and every curse, and every bereavement, and every death of everything in the whole universe, is but one little gust of wind in that tempest-scream of ecstasy. 5. The voice thereof is not articulate. It is in vain to see!:? com­parison. It is absolutely continuous, without breal:?s or beats. If there seem to be vibration therein, it is because of the imperfec­tion of the ears of the seer. 6. And there cometh an interior voice, which sayeth to the seer that he hath trained his eyes well and can see much; and he hath trained his ears a little, and can hear a little; but his other senses hath he trained scarcely at all, and therefore the JEthyrs are al­most silent to him on those planes. By the senses are meant the spiritual correlations of the senses, not the physical senses. But this matters little, because the Seer, so far as he is a seer, is the expres­sion of the spirit of humanity. What is true of him is true of hu­manity, so that even if he had been able to receive the full JEth­yrs, he could not have communicated them. These paragraphs show the central image or event of the vision, the ecstatic sexual union of the Sun and Moon. In Qabalistic terms, these are specifically the Y od C) and Heh-final (ii) of the Great Name ii,i1\\ corresponding not to the Father and Mother, but to the Father and Daughter. She is the \"soul of innocence\" of Malkuth who, by her union with \"the Son\" - this refers to the Knowledge & Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, her wedding in Tiphereth - has been \"placed upon the throne of her Mother\" - borne all the way to Binah in the central event of these visions for Crowley, the crossing of the Abyss and the attainment of the Grade of Magister Templi 8°=3°. It is, then, her role to re­awaken the youth of her father, the original Yod ofii1i1\\ who first begot her upon her mother. It is, unfortunately, necessary to mention that this is allegory. We are not actively preaching father-daughter incest as the key to the redemption of the world. We must see this tale from the point of view of the Daughter. We are each the Qabalistic Princess­Daughter in the beginning of our journey; and it is as her that we finish it as well. The first step is to discover ourselves as we are.

Follow­ing the life-metaphor, this matures us, and turns the girl into a woman. Her Prince-husband places her upon the Throne of the Mother, Binah (and probably upon a pedestal or two along the way); but it is on her own throne that she finds herself. In her ma­turity, she is mate no longer of a boy, but of a man. With all of its blessings and curses, this ancient pattern remains prevalent in our society because it is structurally inherent in deep layers of our col­lective minds. Beneath this is an allegory of our spiritual growth. In the final analysis, it is in Heh-final, rr, Malkuth, Assiah, the field of our ac­tions and senses, that we create the most perfect conditions for the creative expression of the central Seed-Will, the primal impulse of our inmost being. Persephone, the Daughter of Earth (rl), is truly wed to Hades (= Hadit), the Inmost and Hidden One ('); and it is by her own will (by voluntarily eating of his seeds) that she re­mains in Hell, no longer as a captive slave but as its queen. The enduring copulation of' (the Father) with rl (the Daughter) is also the continuous pouring of yourself (your will, your fire: everything you are) into what you have conceived -your Malkuth (\"Kingdom\"), field of action, or dharma. 7. And an Angel speabs: Behold, this vision is utterly beyond thine understanding. Vet shalt thou endeavour to unite thyself with the dreadful marriage-bed. 8. So I am torn asunder, nerve from nerve and vein from vein, and more intimately, - cell from cell, molecule from molecule, and atom from atom, and at the same time all crushed together. Write down that the tearing asunder is a crushing together. All the double phenomena are only two ways of loobing at a single phenomenon; and the single phenomenon is Peace. There is no sense in my words or in my thoughts. \"Faces half-formed arose.\" This is the meaning of that passage; they are attempts to inter­pret Chaos, but Chaos is Peace. Cosmos is the War of the Rose and the Cross. That was \"a half-formed face\" that I said then. All images are useless.

In all the superficial turmoil and opposition, \"the single phenomenon\" that lies behind them all \"is Peace.\" (Chaos, Xaoc;, is a title ofChokmah. Kosmos, KOOJ.loc;, is a cognomen ofBinah.) 9. Blacl:?ness, blacl:?ness intolerable, before the beginning of the light. This is the first verse of Genesis. Holy art thou, Chaos, Chaos, Eternity, all contradictions in terms! 10. Oh, blue! blue! blue! whose reflection in the Abyss is called the Great One of the Night of Time; between ye vibrateth the Lord of the Forces of Matter. This is the blackness of Saturn, corresponding to the Capricorn Moon. By \"blue\" is meant the indigo of Binah, Tav/Saturn, and A'ayin/Capricorn (\" ... her purity hath tinged his black with blue,\" §3). \"The Great One of the Night of Time\" is the esoteric title of Tav, n, as Atu XXI, The Universe. \"Lord of the Forces of Matter\" is the corresponding title of A'ayin, 3.7, as Atu XV, The Devil. 11. 0 Nox, Nox, qui celas infamiam infandi nefandi, Deo solo sit laus qui dedit signum non scribendum. Laus virgini cuius stuprum tradit salutem. The Latin reads: 0 Night, Night, which hides the scandal of the unspeakable, of the abominable, praise be to God alone, who gave the sign not to be written. Praise to the virgin whose rape bequeaths health. Some of the words can be taken in more than one way, as often happens. I do not think, for example, that the virgin's \"rape\" is an act committed upon her, but, as the vision displays, an act com­mitted by her. (Stuprum may mean her \"immorality,\" so called, not merely her passive rape.) 12. 0 Night, that givest suet? from thy paps to sorcery, and theft, and rape, and gluttony, and murder, and tyranny, and to the nameless Horror, cover us, cover us, cover us from the Rod of Des­tiny; for Cosmos must come, and the balance be set up where there was no need of balance, because there was no injustice, but only truth.

At the time Crowley began to scry the 3rd JEthyr, Venus was rising. Feminine energies were even more concentrated by the presence of the Moon on the Eastpoint (cross­ing the Ascendant over the course of the vision: § § 12-13 ). This marks, as well as anything else, the seeming disparity in the symbolism of this rethyr. Both astrologically and Qabalistical­ly, we would expect some of the most pronounced feminine sym­bolism of any of the 30 JEthyrs - but, mostly, it isn't there to be found. On the other hand, the vision Crowley received is primarily one of Mercury; yet there is not even the smallest clue that Mercu­ry symbolism should be expected. Patterns can be found, but they are not afloat upon the surface. Nor are they as sharply defined as was commonplace earlier in the series. I suspect that, by this point, the momentum of Crowley's acceleration toward a climax overwhelmed other considerations. As we soon shall see, he not only was zooming toward the finish of this vision series, but was also approaching the climax of that personal astrological pattern driving his entire undertaking. Having acknowledged the disparity between expectations and actuality, let us dig a bit deeper into it. According to the most persistently valuable Qabalistic scheme we have followed throughout this series, the 3rd JEthyr corresponds to Dinah in Atzilutb. Additionally, Crowley was newly an initiate"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"426 Visions & Voices of Binah, an 8°=3° or Master of the Temple. His point of view was especially of Binah (if the literal paradox in that sentence does not undo its value entirely). With Venus and Luna dominating the horoscope, we would be entitled to expect a markedly feminine vi­sion. We do not get one, though. With the questionable exception of the Lilith section, there is nothing particularly feminine about it at all. Beginning in the 9th .tEthyr, an additional scheme was intro­duced. By this, the 3rd, 2nd, and 1st Aires would correspond to Kether. Broadly speaking, this is evident. For example, §5 says that only in these three cethyrs do we find \"the pure essence,\" a phrase charmingly characteristic of Kether. Finally, these last three visions, read at face value and without preconception, appear to be, respectively, visions of Beth ::J, Gimel l, and Aleph N: The Magus, The Priestess, and The Fool of Tarot. This pattern is quite vivid. I am dwelling on these disparities at such length because they are not simply a failure of one piece of symbolism or another. They appear, on their surface, to be a breakdown in the entire structure of almost everything that has been found fundamentally descriptive of these cethyrs and their consequent visions. And this fact, perhaps more than any other, is what should draw our atten­tion: Things are very different in the last three cethyrs; and, in this 3rd .tEthyr in particular, we are repeatedly told that all is a blind, that the true vision and voice were not received. Much as with the 1Oth .tEthyr, we have every right to wonder whether anything ar­ticulated in this vision is authentic. Having drawn your attention to that perspective, I want to men­tion the one fairly simple explanation that does put many of these outward disparities in perspective. Given that Crowley was him­self newly established in Binah, and that this last triptych corre­sponds to the approach to Kether (which was then far beyond his capacity), we find the explanation in the last sentence of §8: \" ... all these things are the toys of the Magician ... , that barreth the Un­derstanding from the Crown.\" See also §§15 and 36. This is, in­deed, a vision of Binah trying to tum toward Kether - and being turned back from it. Additionally, we are told repeatedly that the vision is not to be trusted, that it is a blind. To return to the astrological factors: In these last visions, the Moon is once more in her increase.

For the 3rd JEthyr, she is in Sidereal Cap­ricorn, or Tropical Aquarius. There is no direct Aquarius sym­bolism (and only a little indirect-see below on the rethyr's name). On the other hand, the goat symbolism of Capricorn recurs throughout, as does the important symbol of the \"eye\" and multi­ple mentions of devils -references to lJ, the Hebrew letter corre­sponding to Capricorn, which means \"eye,\" and, in Tarot, Atu XV, The Devil. §9 and §16 are filled with references to Capricorn, l?, and Atu XV. Capricorn also corresponds with the theme of de­basement that recurs all through the vision. Two close aspects seem not to have much to do with anything: Venus is less than a degree from sextile to Mars. and trine to Jupi­ter. Perhaps the sexual undercurrents of the vision correspond to these; but sexual undercurrents are hardly rare in Crowley's vi­sions and writings under any circumstances. We should not over­rate this quality. There is, however, one final astrological indication, about which Crowley could not possibly have had any information. As­tronomers had not learned it in 1909. The Galactic Center (the very heart-point of our Milky Way galaxy) is at Sidereal 2°07' Sagittarius. 1 As this vision occurred, the Sun was within 1° of per­fect alignment with the center of our galaxy. A day later, when the Sun-GC conjunction was even closer, it was overwhelmed by the opposition of Pluto, an aspect not yet partile on the morning of the 17th. This was, therefore, the date of the single strongest relation­ship of the Sun and the Galactic Center. Keep this in mind when you read §§1-3 and draw your own conclusions, especially with reference to the words, \"In the center is that minute point of light which is the true Sun\" (emphasis added). ZOM or :P LS = Leo, Libra, Aquarius. Here we run into a difficulty, for Crowley, at the time of the vision, mistakenly be­lieved the name was ZON, not ZOM. This gave him the attribu­tions Leo-Libra-Scorpio. There is no doubt that this misconception was behind the specific hieroglyph he forged to open the vision. We want to know, though, whether the attributes of the letters are objective actualities inherent to the nature of this rethyr, prevailing independent of any ideas in Crowley's head. The correct attrib­utes, Leo-Libra-Aquarius, depict the wedding (or equilibration) of Leo and Aquarius -whether as Lion and Eagle, daystar and In December 1909, the Tropical longitude was 25°36' Sagittarius."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"428 Visions & Voices nightstar, Had and Nu, &c. Of all the composite images Crowley might have selected for Leo-Libra-Scorpio, he picked one where Scorpio was symbolized by the infinite serpent circumscribing the universe-a common symbol ofNuit (in the Thelemic Holy Books and elsewhere), and thus as much an Aquarius symbol as it is one of Scorpio. It would appear that the Leo-Libra-Aquarius symbol­ism exists objectively, not requiring Crowley's conscious knowledge. ZOM enumerates to 7 + 70 + 40 = 117. This is the value of the important Qabalistic word �::n�, ophel, \"thick darkness,\" used in many places to represent thick murk or darkness that blinds clear vision in the face of inconceivable Deity. That is the basic nature of this entire vision! Also, the letters ZOM, or r:nn, spell the He­brew word, za 'am, \"anger.\" See §0, immediately below. 0. There is an angry light in the stone; now it is become clear. Contradictory to the rising of Venus at that time; but l:ll7l literally means \"anger, rage, wrath.\" 1. In the centre is that minute point of light which is the true Sun, and in the circumference is the Emerald SnaRe. And joining them are the rays which are the plumes of Maat, and because the dis­tance is infinite, therefore are they parallel from the circumfer­ence, although they diverge from the centre. 2. In all this is no voice and no motion. 3. And yet it seems that the great SnaRe feedeth upon the plumes of Truth as upon itself, so that it contracteth. But ever so little as it contracteth, without it gloweth the golden rim, which is that minute point in the centre. Crowley opened with a hieroglyph forged from symbols of what he believed were the attributes of the name. Leo, 'D, is represented by its ruler, the Sun (hence the §6 footnote's reference to 1 = 8), here also a symbol of Hadit, the \"minute point of light which is the true Sun.\" Scorpio appears as the emerald snake, the circumfer­ence of Nuit (thus a symbol for the true attribute, Aquarius). The spokes are feathers of Maat, goddess of justice, Libra. This image provided a magical gateway that he used to enter the vision proper. 4.

And this being the second reflection, therefore is it the palace of two hundred and eighty judgments. 6. For all these paths1 are in the course of the Flaming Sword from the side of Severity. And the other two paths are Zayin, which is a sword; and Shin, which is a tooth. These are then the five severities which are 280. References to \"the Severities\" are a Qabalistic distraction. If Z, ::P, is taken as Sol (1) instead of Leo (0), 280 is the value Crowley's intellect believed the rethyr's name to have. Crowley knew this number as the value of the five Hebrew letters having final forms, 1 Cl 1 � y, sometimes called \"Letters of Judgment,\" or \"Letters of Severity.\" It is all error and intellectual deflection -an early manifestation of Mercury, the Magician, misleading him. Everything in §6 is based on a wrong premise, and just kept getting worse. 1, ?, and J (the wrong letters) are all on the Light­ning Flash pattern of the Tree of Life as strokes flashing from the left side to the right. (Neither l nor lZ7 is on the Lighting Flash; the reference is simply to their being diagonals pouring from the left toward the center.) 7. All this is communicated to the Seer interiorly. 8. \"And the eye of His benignancy is closed. Let it not be opened upon the JEthyr, lest the severities be mitigated, and the house fall.\" Shall not the house fall, and the Dragon sin!:?? Verily all things have been swallowed up in destruction; and Chaos hath opened his jaws and crushed the Universe as a Bacchanal crusheth a grape between her teeth.

The words mean: \"Do not open the eye of real vision upon this particular rethyr, or your mental delusion will crumble!\" Compare the Thoth deck's Atu XVI, The Tower, to this whole paragraph. Put simply: The path of ::J bars the Understanding of the Master in Binah from direct apperception of Kether. Crowley's psyche seems to have been rebelling at this point, attempting to break free of this restriction. 9. 0 thou that hast beheld the City of the Pyramids, how shouldst thou behold the House of the Juggler? For he is wisdom, and by wisdom hath he made the Worlds, and from that wisdom issue judgements 70 by 4, that are the 4 eyes of the double-headed one; that are the 4 devils, Satan, Lucifer, Leviathan, Belial, that are the great princes of the evil of the world. How shall the 8°=3° perceive Chokmah, Wisdom, 9°=2°? \"City of Pyramids,\" remember, refers to Binah. Study Liber I vel Magi in Appendix C for deeper corollaries of what is hinted here. Also, in Liber n, 1 l7 is at the base of the column headed by ::J. There is much practical doctrine coded in the fact that Beth, ::J, The Magus (and even the individual magician!), acts through the medium of what is meant by Teth, D, Strength or Lust, to produce the conse­quences or results symbolized by A'ayin, lJ, The Devil. Still fo­cused on the number 280, Crowley interpreted this as 4 x 70, where 4 likely refers to the four tools of the magician and each 70 is lJ, an \"eye.\" He interpreted \"four eyes\" as someone two-headed -the Thaumiel, Q'lippoth of Kether (unity divided against itself). The four A'ayins are then interpreted as \"four devils\" (four occur­rences of Atu XV), identified as the four \"Great Princes of Evil\" familiar to students of The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage. In brief, Crowley is still stuck in his gematria brain-loop (and stuck on the number 280), but at least now we know why: The guardians of the path of ::J are messing with him because he does not yet have the right to pass. At the time of the vision, he was not yet a \"Lord of the 121h Path.\" 1 Liber n is reproduced on page 474, in the commentary to the 1st lEthyr, LIL. 10.

Ill.) More intellectual distraction. It does make the valid point that one's God and devil are merely head and tail faces of the same coin. Fortunately, Crowley, seeing past this obsession, later re­canted the interpretation in § 11 as \"my own silly note.\" 12. Moreover, there is Mary, a blasphemy against BABALON, for she hath shut herself up; and therefore is she the Queen of all those wic�ed devils that wal� upon the earth, those that thou sawest even as little bloc� spec�s that stained the Heaven of Urania. And all these are the excrement of Choronzon. About this time, the Moon rose. Feminine images began to appear in the vision. Continuing to demean historic religions, the refer­ence to Mary is likely inspired by his thought, a moment before, about Liber L., Chapter 3: 55Let Mary inviolate be tom upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women be utterly despised among you! 56 Also for beauty's sake and love's! Like the former, this passage is true enough on one plane. On an­other, though, note that MaptE = 156 = Ba�aAov. The \"specks\" are the Black Brothers, here visualized as Choronzon's droppings. 13. And for this is BABALON under the power of the Magician, that she hath submitted herself unto the wor�; and she guardeth the Abyss. And in her is a perfect purity of that which is above; yet she is sent as the Redeemer to them that are below. For there is no other way into the Supernal Mystery but through her, and the Beast on which she rideth; and the Magician is set beyond her to deceive the brothers of blac�ness, lest they should ma�e unto themselves a crown; for if there were two crowns, then should Ygdrasil, that ancient tree, be cast out into the Abyss, uprooted and cast down into the Outermost Abyss, and the Arcanum which is in the Adytum should be profaned; and the Ar� should be touched, and the Lodge spied upon by them that are not"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"432 Visions & Voices masters, and the bread of the Sacrament should be the dung of Choronzon; and the wine of the Sacrament should be the water of Choronzon; and the incense should be dispersion; and the fire upon the Altar should be hate.

This paragraph discusses Binah in relationship to Chokmah and, especially, Beth, :::1. As the Moon continues to rise, we get a deeper look into Her nature. The long passage beginning, \"the Magician is set beyond her\" is absurd - more misdirection - since it would imply that the Black Brothers actually reach beyond Babalon­Binah. They do not. The last sentence, though, immediately re­claims attention: Again, lJ or Capricorn seems to be the integrating idea, since \"Great Terror\" is equated with the experience that, for all intents and purposes, is the \"opening of the Eye.\" (It foreshad­ows a key experience in Crowley's eventual initiation to 9°=2° in 1915.) 14. And this is the mystery that I declare unto thee: that from the Crown itself spring the three great delusions; Aleph is madness, and Beth is falsehood, and Gimel is glamour. And these three be greater than all, for they are beyond the words that I speab unto thee; how much more therefore are they beyond the words that thou transmittest unto men. These three represent three forms of duality (in Act, Word, and Thought, respectively) that must be overcome.

And he is afire; he is terribly athirst; and no help can come to him, for the shew-stone blazeth ever with the fury and the torment and the blacbness, and the stench of human flesh. The bowels of little children are torn out and thrust into his mouth, and poison is dropped into his eyes.

(He had rightly attained to Binah.) His prior emotional, habituated reactions were not charac­teristic of supernal consciousness. Everything is immediately brought into perspective when that consciousness is restored.

What has gone before in this vision has been of Choronzon. None of it can be trusted. Was this due to the original technical error in the name (ZON = 89 in Crowley's mind, the isolative restriction of the Black Brothers)? Or due to the nature of the rethyr (\"thick darkness\" veiling Binah-Sinai from \"seeing God face-to-face\"? :J misdirecting Binah's perception of Kether)? This is not clear. But he is instructed to give the Sign of 8°=3° to invoke Babalon to ward \"against the iniquity of the Abyss,\" which is specifically equated to the \"iniquity\" in the path of :::l. He is told that only a 9°=2° could penetrate that last triple-projection which is the ap­proach to Kether and the Grade ofipsissimus, or 10°=1°. (Crow­ley interpreted this last portion differently, but I stick by what I have written here.) 37. For Choronzon is as it were the shell or excrement of these three paths, and therefore is his head raised unto Daath, and therefore have the Blacl:? Brotherhood declared him to be the child of Wisdom and Understanding, who is but the bastard of the Svastil:?a. And this is that which is written in the Holy Qaba­lah, concerning the Whirlpool and Leviathan, and the Great Stone . Choronzon is called the q 'lippah of Aleph, Gimel, and Beth. He is also equated to the eight-headed serpent of the Golden Dawn 4=7 diagram, \"The Fall,\" which raises its head only so far as Da'ath. We are told it is misdirection to regard Da'ath as the child of Chokmah and Binah. While it is highly questionable whether any­thing in this vision can be trusted, there is actually truth in this: Da'ath is not the child of Chokmah (Father) and Binah (Mother); that child is Tiphereth. However, Da'ath-which means \"know­ledge,\" which, rightly understood, means intimate union - is the conjugal embrace of Chokmah and Binah that brings forth that child. This intimate ecstasy is the ultimate abasement of Cho­ronzon, against whom the name BABALON proves victorious."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"438 Visions & Voices For the final sentence, see The Zohar: Leviathan is \"broken by the waters of the Great Sea,\" i.e., of Binah.

Thus long have I tall:�ed with thee in bidding thee depart, that the memory of the JEthyr might be dulled; for hadst thou come bact:? suddenly into thy mortal frame, thou hadst fallen into madness or death. For the vision is not such that any may endure it. His guide in the vision indicates that the latter part has been all blather. It is quite unclear that there is any real validity in it. Per­haps everything after the specific vision of the Magician should be taken as nonsense or, at least, unreliable. But then, probably every­thing before that point should be as well! 39.

No other rethyr has demanded this type of care from him upon return. The Qabalistic mystery given is based on a very strange, forced rendering of the Greek name Xaoc; in Hebrew letters: OliJ:J = 156 = ll7��ClN::J.

As we have witnessed, Uranus opposed Neptune throughout this 28-day vision cycle. For most of that time, both planets squared Crowley's natal Sun, providing his personal astrological matrix for this month-long mystical process that altered his life and rearchitected his psyche. Neptune came first: In transit to the Sun, it is primarily ego dis­solving. Uranus followed Neptune, completing the one-two blow to his prior reality system. Uranus transiting the Sun signals awak­ening, revelation, and naked disclosure of self and purpose. This 2nd JEthyr vision provided the climax to that process. When he began on November 23, Neptune squared his Sun within 1°. Uranus did not. Uranus did not enter this tight orb until November 29 when he scried the 2181 JEthyr. You may wish to re­read that vision to see the level of its impact. Uranus and Neptune exactly opposed each other December 2, the day Crowley scried the 16th JEthyr.

(So many celes­tial energies were shifting and rearranging at that juncture that it is difficult to sort the effect ofNeptune's departure from the rest of the influences.) All came to a head with the visions of ARN. But - and this fact deserves your utmost attention - this preci­sion timetable only runs true in the Sidereal Zodiac. If the transits are measured in the Tropical, the whole pattern dissolves into mist. Why does the zodiac make this difference in the timing of transits (you might ask)? It is because of the most fundamental difference between the Sidereal and Tropical frameworks. This most funda­mental difference is not the different sign-placements - that's a secondary effect. It is that the starting point of the Tropical Zodiac is hitched to the Northern hemisphere's Vernal Equinox point (\"Aries begins with the first day of spring\") and this point is con­stantly moving. In contrast, the Sidereal Zodiac is fixed - at least, as fixed as anything can be in an eternally shifting universe. Any variability in its architecture would be measurable only over mil­lions of years. In short, the Sidereal Zodiac is based upon the whole of the body of Nuit Herself. It is a product of all of 11-dimensional space-time. On the other hand, due to precession of the equinoxes, the Tropical starting point is constantly moving. Over time, this dis­torts the timing of transits, which are most profitably measured in a nonmoving, precession-free -sidereal -framework. Some Tropical astrologers, wishing to stick to the zodiac theory they know but recognizing the fact of better transit timing in the Side­real, apply a small adjustment to natal planet positions every year to get the effect of Sidereal transit timing. In effect, those Tropical astrologers are creating their own custom-built sidereal zodiac, but with different sign boundaries. How much is this precessional shift? The Fixed and Moving frameworks slip further out of alignment 1° every 72 years. That's half a degree in 36 years, or 5' of arc for every six years of life. Since transits are commonly timed within no more than a 1° orb, and reach their peak at or very near to exact contact, even as early as young adulthood this throws timing of slow-planet transits quite a bit out of whack."},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"442 Visions & Voices In December 1909, Crowley was 34 years old. The Vernal point had shifted 28' of arc since his birth. In the Tropical frame­work, the Uranus transit to his Sun was barely within half a degree on December 18. Tropically, there was nothing to mark the date as significant to him personally when, in fact, Isis lifted her veil and he came face-to-face with the heart of his Inmost Mystery. Other astrological factors also speak eloquently from this horo­scope for the vision, describing more universal features and the fabric of the vision itself. Chief of these is the Sun's continued 1° conjunction with the Galactic Center, to which was added its exact opposition to Pluto. Both are powerful indications of cosmic-level consciousness, and the Sun-Pluto is paradigm shifting. Mars was within 1 o orb of op­position to Jupiter, expressive of not only virility and enthusiasm, but also of religious passion or zeal. We see one interesting mani­festation of this early in the vision, when his thoughts flowed to­ward the mythology of the religious sanctification of blood. At the time Crowley first attempted the vision, the Moon was sextile Mercury. This had expired later in the day when he under­took Part 3. It probably accounts for the greater amount of intellec­tual content in the first two parts, which quite definitely had evap­orated by Part 3. Luna was in Aquarius in the Sidereal Zodiac, and Pisces in the Tropical. Either is sufficiently \"occult,\" so it is not sufficient to say that Pisces fits because this vision is so mystical. (They are all \"so mystical.\") There is not a hint of specific Pisces symbolism except in Part 3, where environmental factors cloud the issue. At the same time, it is hard to assert that Aquarius is so influential (even though it fits the visions well) because the Uranus transit to natal Sun would have produced nearly all the same results. If you want to draw your own conclusions on which Moon-sign fits bet­ter, I suggest you set out the two Tarot trumps, The Star (Aquari­us) and The Moon (Pisces) from the Thoth deck, and see which one better portrays the details of this vision to you. Venus rose as this scrying began. She is prominent in the horo­scopes for all four sessions. In Part 1, she intruded most visibly at the time she actually crossed the Ascendant, about two-thirds of the way through. In theory, the 2\"d lEthyr corresponds to Chokmah in Atziluth. This is decisively on target in one specific way: To Chokmah is at-tributed \"The Visialj sumption that �� exactly what C ·. tion with Babalon-tj ARN or kJ '-4 200 + 50 = 251. n.ij ARN is actually .,, aron, it is the w no mistaking that..

ARN or ;C,y = Taurus, Pisces, Scorpio! It enumerates to 1 + 200 + 50 = 251. The most interesting fact that this discloses is that ARN is actually a Hebrew word. Spelled 11�, and pronounced aron, it is the word for \"ark\" - the Ark of the Covenant. There is no mistaking that, in this vision, Crowley was admitted into the Holy of Holies. ARN, itself, is the Sacred Ark therein, and Sheki­nah-Babalon descended thereupon. (With different paintings, 11� is oren, \"cedar wood,\" and aran, \"a wild goat.\") 1. In the first place, there is again the woman riding on the bull, which is the reflection of BABALON, that rideth on The Beast. And also there is an Assyrian legend of a woman with a fish, and also there is a legend of Eve and the Serpent, for Cain was the child of Eve and the Serpent, and not of Eve and Adam; and therefore when he had slain his brother, who was the first mur­derer, having sacrificed living things to his demon, had Cain the mar� upon his brow, which is the mar� of the Beast spo�en of in the Apocalypse, and is the sign of initiation. Beginning with the first letter of ARN, which corresponds to Tau­rus, Crowley began building his \"admission badge\" - the astral hi­eroglyph that would attune him to the vibrations of the cethyr and grant him entry. He first used a bull image from an earlier vision (A, ?j), then generalized it to a Pisces variant involving a fish (R, 1-t), then a serpent variant corresponding to Scorpio (N, ll\\.). Con­cluding this process with the \"Eve and the Serpent\" tale, his stream of consciousness flowed along associated channels and took up the legend of Cain and Abel. Part 1 of this vision corresponds to the \"chamber of reflection\" which some formal initiations place outside of, and preparatory to, 1 The classic geomancy-based way of enumerating Enochian scores one strik­ing hit here: By it, ARN = 1, p, J = 6 + 100 + 50 = 156, the value of the name Babalon; and this vision is of her revelation. Of all 30 rethyrs, none produced so decisive and clear a endorsement of this method of gematria. Its one, ironic weakness is that \"Babalon\" is an Enochian word, but it dres not add to 156 in Enochian - only in Hebrew and Greek."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"444 Visions & Voices the actual ceremony. (§ 11 candidly states that this first part is \"all. .. before the veil.\") The Hegemon has not yet fetched him into the temple. Within the chamber of reflection, one \"gets what one needs,\" something unique to each candidate, and the opportunity for \"psychic boil-off' to clear the mind. Crowley's psyche flowed along the channels of the legend of Cain. 2. The shedding of blood is necessary, for God did not hear the children of Eve until blood was shed. And that is external religion; but Cain spabe not with God, nor had the mart? of initiation up­on his brow, so that he was shunned of all men, until he had shed blood. And this blood was the blood of his brother. This is a mys­tery of the sixth bey of the Taro, which ought not to be called The Lovers, but The Brothers. 3. In the middle of the card stands Cain; in his right hand is the Hammer of Thor with which he hath slain his brother, and it is all wet with his blood. And his left hand he holdeth open as a sign of innocence. And on his right hand is his mother Eve, around whom the serpent is entwined with his hood spread behind her head; and on his left hand is a figure somewhat libe the Hindoo Kali, but much more seductive. Vet I !:?now it to be Lilith. And above him is the Great Sigil of the Arrow, downward, but it is strucb through the heart of the child. This Child also is Abel. And the meaning of this part of the card is obscure, but that is the correct drawing of the Taro card; and that is the correct magical fable from which the Hebrew scribes, who were not complete Initiates, stole their legend of the Fall and the subsequent events. They joined different fables together to try and mabe a connected sto­ry, and they sophisticated them to suit their social and political conditions. \"Shedding of blood is necessary,\" is the primary doctrine of this section. Everything else is mythologizing to justify that one simple premise. Crowley attempted to develop this premise in Chapter 12 of Magick in Theory & Practice (which chapter, he wrote, was almost certain to be misunderstood). Compared to the main flow of the vision, all of this is of proportionately minor doctrinal im­port, but its basic points are worth a little study. Notice now much the opening of this vision (ARN, aron, the Ark of the Covenant) connects to the ancient Hebrew religion. §2 earlier, the M symbolically __ There is also -fll Tarot trump o� \"heroic twins\" ·· This can be s -Jung et a/. ;.\"\" I shall not e · . would fill a large 4.

As mentioned earlier, the Mars-Jupiter opposition, partile in space that day, is symbolically appropriate for \"blood-religion.\" There is also a certain truth to the statement that the Gemini Tarot trump ought to be called The Brothers. In most cultures, the \"heroic twins\" archetype was manifest in tales of twin brothers. This can be studied in fair depth in Man & His Symbols by C.G. Jung et al. I shall not elaborate or explain the myth of Cain any further. It would fill a large essay. 4. All this while no image hath come into the Stone, and no voice hath been heard. s. I cannot get any idea of the source of what I have been say­ing. All I can say is, that there is a sort of dew, lil:?e mist, upon the Stone, and yet it has become hot to the touch. Such stream-of-consciousness mental behavior is common in a chamber of reflection. Think of Part 1 as a form of \"purifying the channels\" by letting any active psychic trends \"run themselves out\" like a reel-to-reel tape. The \"hot to the touch\" feel of the scry­ing stone seems to say that the magical forces were well invoked and mobilized for the initiation ahead. 6. All I get is that the Apocalypse was a recension of a dozen or so totally disconnected allegories, that were pieced together, and ruthlessly planed down to mal:?e them into a connected account; and that recension was re-written and edited in the interests of Christianity, because people were complaining that Christianity could show no true spiritual l:?nowledge, or any food for the best minds: nothing but miracles, which only deceived the most igno­rant, and Theology, which only suited pedants. 7. So a man got hold of this recension, and turned it Christian, and imitated the style of John. And this explains why the end of the world does not happen every few years, as advertised. Digressive commentary (more mental \"boil-off') of negligible value. It is not even very original, though it is an obvious expres­sion of the exact Moon-Mercury sextile. Surely these were simply thoughts Crowley had at some earlier date that now were brought to the fore."},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"446 Visions & Voices 8. There is nothing whatever in the Stone but a White Rose. And a voice comes: there shall be no more red roses, for she hath crushed all the blood of all things into her cup. 9. It seemed at one time as if the rose was in the breast of a beautiful woman, high-bosomed, tall, stately, yet who danced lil:?e a snal:?e. But there was no subsistence in this vision. Here it begins! Venus crossed the Ascendant at approximately this minute (rising at 9:56a.m.), and the image of the rose appeared. In a sense, this symbol is the Hegemon of his initiation. A white rose is a symbol of profound love like the red rose, but is drained of its blood. Its animal component has been burned away. 10. And now I see the white Rose, as if it were in the beat? of a swan, in the picture by Michaal Angelo in Venice. And that legend too is the legend of BABALON. The swan is a symbol of ecstasy.

Other text describes the state he was in, and his deepening preparation for what was to come. The horoscope remains substantially unchanged since the start of the prior attempt at ARN. Venus even retains prominence, being only a few degrees above the Ascendant. Now, though, the Moon has come to the Eastpoint: the feminine energies of the hour were pronounced. The Moon is also now only 8' from her exact sextile with Mercury-and it shows! 12. It is not a question of being unable to get into the JEthyr, and trying to struggle through; but one is not anywhere near it. The rethyr had been correctly invoked and was present. His psyche was not yet attuned to the heightened vibratory rate that would have been required for him to perceive it correctly. He did not even have the necessary concepts or mental orientation to frame what he might have seen. There was nothing for the Light to \"grab hold of' to forge communication. The Moon (now angular) was still sextile Mercury (becoming exact during this portion of the vi­sion), and his intellect was still fully engaged. He did not have the right concept of the silence that was required for this step. 13. A voice comes: When thy dust shall strew the earth whereon She wal�eth, then mayest thou bear the impress of Her foot. And thou thin�est to behold Her face!

And The Cry of the 2nd LEthyr ARN 449 This \"dust\" is the residuum of the Master of the Temple who was annihilated in crossing the Abyss. (For an explanation of this, see Liber Cheth in Appendix C, and earlier ::ethyrs.) It is not clear whence the voice originates, so its exact psychological import re­mains unclear; but this entire section of the vision refers to the an­cient doctrine of the goddess: \"I am Isis, and no man lifts my veil.\" The surface teaching is that She lifts it from within. But al­so, \"no man\" is Nemo, the Master of the Temple. This gives the sentence positive form. 14. The Stone is become of the most brilliant whiteness, and yet, in that whiteness, all the other colours are implicit. The colour of an­ything is but its dullness, its obstructiveness. So is it with these vi­sions. All that they are is falsity. Every idea merely marRs where the mind of the Seer was too stupid to receive the light, and therefore reflected it. Therefore, as the pure light is colourless, so is the pure soul blacR. This passage is an example of supernal perception, thought, and articulation. The whiteness and \"all the other colors\" were per­ceived at the same time, rather than one in lieu of the other. The next part shows that he had learned the lesson of the 3rd LEthyr. The last sentence is a basic tenet of post-Crowlean mysticism that should be meditated until it is utterly understood. 15. And this is the Mystery of the incest of CHAOS with his daugh­ter • This is the concupiscence of Yod, ',the Father, and Heh-final rr, the Daughter. See the Vision of the 4th LEthyr and its commentary. 16. There is nothing whatever visible. 17. But I asRed of an Angel that is at my side if the ceremony hath been duly performed. And he says: Yes, the JEthyr is present. It is thou that canst not perceive it, even as I cannot perceive it, because it is so entirely beyond thy conception that there is noth­ing in thy mind on to which it can cast a symbol, even as the emptiness of space is not heated by the fire of the sun. And so pure is the light that it preventeth the formation of images, and therefore have men called it darRness. For with any lesser light, the mind responds, and maRes for itself divers palaces. It is that which is written: \"In my Father's house there are many mansions\";"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"450 Visions & Voices and if the house be destroyed, how much more the mansions that are therein! For this is the victory of BABALON over the Magician that ensorcelled her. For as the Mother she is 3 by 52, and as the harlot she is 6 by 26; but she is also 12 by 13, and that is the pure unity. Moreover she is 4 by 39, that is, victory over the power of the 4, and in 2 by 78 hath she destroyed the great Sor­cerer. Thus is she the synthesis of 1 and 2 and 3 and 4, which being added are 10, therefore could she set her daughter upon her own throne, and defile her own bed with her virginity. The angel-guide explains the points mentioned above with respect to the observation in § 12 that nothing could be seen. I am reminded of experiences I had over many years, beginning with my early attempts to explore the Enochian elemental tablets as a Neophyte. Much of my astral exploration consisted of com­munication with one or another of the Enochian Seniors. Consist­ently, these Briatic beings were helpful and forthcoming, radiant in the enormity of their love, and ready to assist in my mystical and magical explorations. But, there seemed to be one significant exception. Every time (without exception) that I would ask any of them a question about Babalon, the Seniors would grow entirely quiet. They would say nothing at all. More often than not, they would gaze off into the distance. I could not understand why they would not answer my question on this topic. How unfair (I thought) that these, perhaps the best direct source of instruction on this one matter, should refuse to help me. It took me years to realize what was really occurring. They were not refusing to answer my question. They were doing every­thing in their power to answer it. The answer was that She is Si­lence. More than that, the actual feel of the Seniors (quite easy to perceive in the empathically open astral context) was their best hope of impacting me with the answer I sought. I was just too dense to get it. In the vision now under discussion, Crowley did not yet under­stand the real nature of the silence that greeted him. Soon, though, he would understand it. \"And so pure is the light that it preventeth the formation of im­ages, and therefore have men called it darkness.\" Vision, as we know it, requires shadows.

Either appears equally obscure. But Wisdom teaches us to be strong- that we may bear more joy. Furthermore, \"the formation of images\" is a function of Yetzirah, the World ofFormation. This passage, therefore, applies to Briah, the higher World corresponding (as does Binah in a dif­ferent sense) to the letter i1. This passage corrects the common misunderstanding and confusion ofN.O.X. with infernal darkness deprived of light. It is not that at all. It is the supernal darkness that transcends L.V.X. (\"Light\"), a light too intense for our senso­rium to register, \"the light higher than eyesight.\" In speaking of this, Liber LXV 1: 12 says, \"There is a light so strenuous that it is not perceived as light.\" \" .. .if the house be destroyed.\" See the 3rd .tEthyr for the point to which this is counterpoint. The next sentences confirm that he learned the lesson of ZOM, and that Babalon (who, impersonally, may be equated with cosmic consciousness) now has broken free from the \"ensorcelling\" of the intellect. Then, of course, having remarked on Babalon's liberation from Mercury, Crowley gushed as a fountain of gematria! His remarks may be studied in standard references on the subject, of which Se­pher Sephiroth remains the most useful (especially when we are researching ideas resident in Crowley's mind at that time). Note that 12 x 13 (the architecture of the Enochian elemental tablets) is given as the most pure form. One of these equations might be obscure: 4 x 39 is interpreted as ''victory over the power of the 4.\" The key is that 39 is the value of1n� rl1i1\\ Yod Heh Vav Heh Echad, the Divine Name of which the most expressive translation is, \"Reality is ONE.\" This is not the lesser Jehovah, the divisive Gnostic demiurge below the Abyss; rather, it is that 7-lettered higher expression of Love-Unity that puts a lie to \"the power of the 4.\" Also, 39 is '?D, tal, \"dew\" - a dew that \"drops down from heaven\" (see Deut. 33:28), a mystery ofNuit-Babalon already explored with respect to the 20th and 17th .tEthyrs. 18. And I as!:? the Angel if there is any way by which I can mal:?e myself worthy to behold the Mysteries of this JEthyr. 19. And he saith: It is not in my l:?nowledge.

It was a matter of mechanics, how to position his psyche in the same context as the flow of the Aire. His guide suggested he re­peat the Call of the lEthyr by which he already had approached. He was counseled to do this in silence, and then to wait patiently. These were not idle suggestions. 20. This is the translation of the Call of the .lEthyr. 21. 0 ye heavens which dwell in the first Aire, and are mighty in the parts of the earth, and execute therein the judgment of the highest, to you it is said: Behold the face of your God, the be­ginning of comfort, whose eyes are the brightness of the heavens which provided you for the government of the earth, and her unspeabable variety, furnishing you with a power of understand­ing, that ye might dispose all things according to the foresight of Him that sitteth on the Holy Throne, and rose up in the begin­ning, saying, The earth, let her be governed by her parts (this is the prostitution of BABALON to Pan), and let there be division in her (the formation of the Many from the One), that her glory may be always ecstasy and irritation of orgasm.

Now from time to time I have lool:?ed into the Stone, but never is there any image therein, or any hint thereof; but now there are three arrows, arranged thus: 23. This is the letter Aleph in the Alphabet of Arrows. He received, as his reward, a doctrinal instruction that provided new understanding and served to retune his psyche: a deep com­mentary upon the intent of the Call of the 30 .tEthyrs. Until the opening of the Vision of the 9th .tEthyr, Crowley had looked upon the Call quite literally, so that it surely seemed an apocalyptic vi­sion of terror and destruction. Having come through the Abyss, that perspective changed; and there, and again in this 2nd .tEthyr, he learned that he simply had been thinking about it all wrong! The standard form of this 19th Call was given in Chapter 5. What is given here is nearly identical (other than Crowley's inter­pretive asides). Some exceptions: \"Providence\" is now translated \"foresight.\" \" ... that her glory may be always drunken and vexed in itself' is now, \" ... may be always ecstasy and irritation of or­gasm.\" \"Her building\" has become \"His building\" (which, given Crowley's relating this to the Vault of the Adepts, I believe is a mistake). Perhaps the most important change is in the passage originally given as, \"I regret that I made man,\" now translated, \"It rejoiceth me concerning the Virgin and the Man.\" Crowley indicated that the former was an intentional distortion by Edward Kelley who could not accept that what he received was correct. (It is difficult to see how the Enochian original, Moooah ol cordziz, may have meant what Crowley received as the corrected text, so we are lim­ited to the amended English form.) One item at the end gives us evidence concerning the correct method of enumerating Enochian. It is the God-name IADNAMAD, commonly translated \"knowledge\" (in the way that the Hebrew n:l.711 in?�, Eloah va-Da'ath, is employed as a Divine Name of Tiphereth). � Enochian g ter name AI� saw, in his� This confrrmatx.j Do not rm�ss Presumably the ... · perform the in · no practical · · 24. {I want to 5G1f4 Call of the� on red hot steel) '. � 25.And now till and tortures me.

Enumerated by the geomancy-based scheme of Enochian gematria Crowley employed in his The Vision & the Voice commentary, the name adds to 195, which has no particular significance. But if added as recommended in this present book, as if it were Hebrew (1�7:J�J1�'), it totals to 111, the value of the let­ter name Aleph, X\")?�. Immediately after uttering this, Crowley saw, in his stone, the letter Aleph in the \"Alphabet of Arrows.\" This confirmation could not be more decisive. Do not miss that §20 says that this is a translation of the Call. Presumably the Enochian original is unaffected. Therefore, if you perform the invocation in the original Enochian language, there is no practical difference in method. 24. (I want to say that while I was doing the translation of the Call of the JEthyrs, the soles of my feet were burning, as if I were on red hot steel.) 25. And now the fire has spread all over me, and parches me, and tortures me. And my sweat is bitter liRe poison. And all my blood is acrid in my veins, liRe gleet. I seem to be all festering, rot­ting; and the worms eating me while I am yet alive. Kundalini phenomena, though possibly not balanced. This descrip­tion is highly reminiscent of times when the fiery Pingala (the channel flowing up the right side of the spine) carries a signifi­cantly stronger current than the cooler, watery Ida (up the left). 26. A voice, neither in myself nor out of myself, is saying: Remem­ber Prometheus; remember lxion. What Prometheus and Ixion shared was the motto: \"Dare heaven!\" This would seem to be the advice Crowley was given at this junc­ture. \"Damn the gods, and go for it!\" 27. I am tearing at nothing. I will not heed. For even this dust must be consumed with fire. He used the A:.A:. Dominus Liminis grade sign (same as the G.D. Portal sign), the Sign of the Rending of the Veil. Pingala continues to be the predominant channel of energy moving through him, as if rising up to push him through his own limitations. Note the idea already in the human aspect of his mind that the dust he had become \"must be consumed with fire.\" This later emerged in Liber Cheth (see Appendix C) and elsewhere as a"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"456 Visions & Voices description of the process whereby the Magister Templi 8°=3° becomes a Magus 9°=2°: \"for from the dust shall a white ash be prepared by Hermes the Invisible.\" 28. And now, although there is no image, at last there is a sense of obstacle, as if one were at length drawing near to the frontier of the JEthyr. 29. But I am dying. 30. I can neither strive nor wait. There is agony in my ears, and in my throat, and mine eyes have been so long blind that I can­not remember that there ever was such a thing as sight. These are standard phenomena. Apparently, they were very ardu­ous for Crowley in that hour. Given the dramatic difference of what he experienced when next he attempted this rethyr (later the same day), it seems these also were phenomena of his being pre­pared to handle more- being \"stepped up.\" Regarding the blind­ness, remember the illumination of Saul of Tarsus, who became St. Paul. Bucke, in his analysis in Cosmic Consciousness, rightly understood this as a side effect of superconscious impact. 31. And it cometh to me that I should go away, and await the coming of the veil of the JEthyr; not here. I thinb I will go to the Hot Springs. 32. So I put away the Stone upon my breast. \" .. .it cometh to me that I should go away.\" At the end of the vi­sion, a few minutes before noon, the Sun-Pluto opposition (aligned with the Galactic Center) had just crested the meridian.

This surely relaxed him. His mind and body had been plagued by nervousness accompanied by physical tension. The change of environment helped release this. Certainly the passing away of the morning's Moon-Mercury aspect assisted with mental and physical relaxation as well! As Venus had been rising when the morning session began, so had she just crossed the Midheaven a few minutes before he re­newed his efforts in the afternoon. Similarly, when this Part 3 be­gan, the Moon was exactly on the Zenith. For this intimate contact with the Goddess herself, the feminine energy from Venus and Luna was pronounced once again. For this one part of the 2nd lEthyr excursion, the Tropical Pisces Moon is as good a fit as the Sidereal placement in Aquarius. Yet, even as I declined to over-value the Aquarius symbolism (since Uranus' exact transit to Crowley's Sun would have produced much the same result), here we also must exercise caution against over-emphasizing a Pisces influence. The vision's profusion of water-devils churning the deeps with tails and shouting fuming heresies at the magician were surely the product of his environ­ment - his physical emersion in hot, effervescent waters stinking of brimstone.

Flashes of lightning are playing in the Stone, at the top; and at the bottom of the Stone there is a bloc� pyramid, and at the top thereof is a vesica piscis. The vesica piscis is of colourless bril­liance. The black pyramid is an ensign of Binah. The lightning symbol stirs many responses in subconsciousness; among other things, it is a symbol of fertility foreshadowing a startling revelation, and the simple raw crackle of discharging neurons as Crowley's psyche opened, surrendering, to the plane of this .ethyr, as he recited the Call of ARN for the fourth time that day. The vessica piscis, as well, is one of the most important femi­nine symbols, representing the yoni and womb. It also has exten­sive, profound mathematical symbolism, for examples of which see The Canon.1 34. The two curves of Pisces are thus: 35. They are the same curves as the curves of vesica piscis, but turned round. This vessica, however, is different. Its two halves are divided, and stand back-to-hack as if they were a Pisces glyph (�, the R in ARN and the Tropical Moon-sign) without its connecting umbili­cus. Crowley described this as \"a last desperate attempt of the Ruach of the Seer to escape the Terror of the Presence of Baba­lon.\" However, this assessment presumes that there is something wrong with the symbol as it appeared. Neither the tone of the vi­sion, nor the quiet spiritual intensity of the vessica's \"colorless brilliance,\" suggests any such problem. Often crescents in exactly this arrangement describe the closing and opening lunar phases that straddle a New Moon. There are other possible meanings as well, including twin serpentine streams of energy sometimes 1 Apprentices of Temple of Thelema are familiar with a compelling symbol of a three-fold Mother that portrays the vessica in an elaborate, interwoven fashion."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"460 Visions & Voices shown in opposing hands of a goddess such as Babalon. (Consider that complementary Venus and Mars energies flank Pisces in the nameARN.) 36. And a voice comes: How can that which is buried in the pyr­amids behold that which descendeth upon its apex? A challenge at the gate of the final ordeal of this initiation. That which is buried in the pyramids is the \"little pile of dust,\" all that remains of the Magister (see Liber Cheth). However, this question presumes the logic and the space-time orientation that prevail be­low the Abyss. Perhaps its real purpose is to weed out those who are ill prepared. Crowley also understood the question to allude to tantric counsel encoded in Liber L. 1:14. (Remember that the Greek words for pyramid and phallus have the same numeration.) 37. Again it comes to me, without voice: Therefore is motherhood the symbol of the Masters. For first must they give up their virgin­ity to be destroyed, and the seed must lie hidden in them while the nine moons wax and wane, and they must surround it with the Universal Fluid. And they must feed it with blood for fire. Then is the child a living thing. And afterwards is much suffering and much joy, and after that are they torn asunder, and this is all their thanR, that they give it to sucR. 38. All this while the vision in the Shew-Stone stays as it was, save that the lightning grows more vehement and clear; and be­hind the vesica piscis is a blacR cross extending to the top and to the edges of the Stone. And now blacRness spreads, and swallows up the images. The energy increases its intensity. A black cross, in earlier visions of this series, has been that from the Hegemon's lamen in the Golden Dawn: a symbol of the Maat archetype attributed to that office in the Osiris lEon. Crowley suspected that it had the same relevance in the present place. (By the way, in the G.D. this sym­bol also was the Admission Badge of the 4=7 Grade, themes from which have played a major role in this Vision of the 2nd lEthyr.) But note also that the cross is the phallus. As its absence from the circle in the 3rd lEthyr was regarded as a blasphemy, so is its presence here a sanctification.

Now there is naught but the vast blacb triangle having the apex downwards, and in the centre of the blacb triangle is the face of Typhon, the Lord of the Tempest, and he crieth aloud: Despair! Despair! For thou mayest deceive the Virgin, and thou mayest cajole the Mother; but what wilt thou say unto the an­cient Whore that is throned in Eternity? For if she will not, there is neither force nor cunning, nor any wit, that may prevail upon her. 40. Thou canst not woo her with love, for she is love. And she hath all, and hath no need of thee. 41. And thou canst not woo her with gold, for all the bings and captains of the earth, and all the gods of heaven, have showered their gold upon her. Thus hath she all, and hath no need of thee. 42. And thou canst not woo her with bnowledge, for bnowledge is the thing that she hath spurned. She hath it all, and hath no need of thee. 43. And thou canst not woo her with wit, for her Lord is Wit. She hath it all, and hath no need of thee. Despair! Despair! 44. Nor canst thou cling to her bnees and asb for pity; nor canst thou cling to her heart and asb for love; nor canst thou put thine arms about her necb, and asb for understanding; for thou hast had all these, and they avail thee not. Despair! Despair! Now begins the confrontation with Typhon, corresponding to the Scorpio symbolism of N, J, in ARN. The black \"water triangle\" often would be a positive symbol of Binah. In this case, though, it is used as an averse expression of the \"fire\" triangle that appeared in the last rethyr. In this way, it parallels the black floor of the Vault of the Adepti where a similar \"reversed\" triangle is a symbol of infernal forces untamed within subconsciousness. Typhon, in any case, serves as the Dweller on the Threshold. This ferocious storm-god is surely, as well, a manifestation of Crowley's own subconscious forces building in intensity to try \"to take Heaven by storm.\" In other words, Typhon is a shadow mani­festation of Crowley's aspiration, the incarnation of his doubts, yet the ferocity of his own courageous aspiration."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"462 Visions & Voices 45. Then I toob the Flaming Sword, and I let it loose against Ty­phon, so that his head was cloven asunder, and the blacb triangle dissolved in lightnings. The Flaming Sword symbolizes Atziluthic manifestation of crea­tion, the instantaneous formation of the entire Tree of Life. Its hilt, that Crowley magically seized, is in Kether. This is also the Flaming Sword placed before the Gate of Eden (outside the veil of the Supernals) to bar entrance, blasting the head of the infernal serpent lifted unto Da'ath. 46. But as he parted his voice brobe out again: Nor canst thou win her with the Sword, for her eyes are fixed upon the eyes of Him in whose hand is the hilt of the Sword. Despair! Despair! 47. And the echo of that cry was his word, which is identical, although it be diverse: Nor canst thou win her by the Serpent, for it was the Serpent that seduced her first. Despair! Despair! Typhon's departing taunt juxtaposes the Flaming Sword and the Serpent of Wisdom. The Flaming Sword strikes downward from Kether to Malkuth, touching each of the 10 sephiroth in turn. The Serpent of Wisdom rises from Malkuth to Kether, touching each of the 22 paths in turn, but entering not into the sephiroth; it signi­fies the Path of Initiation. 48.

The last calm before the storm of superconscious forces that were about to ravish him. The scrying stone was quiet, inert, and silent. Not merely inactive, but \"a thousand times more lifeless than when it is not invoked.\" There then appeared a symbol with which Crowley apparently was unfamiliar, for he mistook its meaning as something dark and threatening. (Crowley had a lot of un­addressed mother issues.) It was a black rose. Most simply, this is a representation of Babalon, or Nuit. If we did not already know this, its 156 petals should have made the fact clear. The black rose combines all the main ideas associated with the rose in its earlier red, yellow, and white forms with the rich, velvety darkness of Supernal Night (N.O.X.).1 In the Middle Ages, the phrase sub rosa, \"beneath the rose,\" came to signify the extremely and intimately confidential. Its ex­tension, sub rosa nigra, \"under the black rose,\" represents an even more profound silence . A black rose has an important place in British history. King Henry VIII formed an \"Order of the Black Rose\" to reward those who had saved his daughter Mary from attempted murder. Accord­ing to surviving legends, Princess Mary named the order after a 1 In Temple of The lema, the black (indigo) rose is a distinctive symbol of the Grand Pr�monstrator, the Order's supreme Chesed-themed officer."},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"464 Visions & Voices solitary black rose she saw blooming outside Blackfriar Monas­tery. The rose actually was blood red, but so deep in color as to appear black. Therefore, its symbolism includes that of both blood and night. All of this is consistent with its sacredness to Babalon, as mani­fest in this vision. It appeared in Crowley's field of vision as the last veil of the Goddess. The next moment, that veil was with­drawn, with no small impact on Crowley's body and mind. §§53-77: Most of what follows is the record of Crowley's overwhelm. Most of it needs no commentary at all; it speaks eloquently for itself. Only a few technical Qabalistic details will be highlighted. 53. Aha! Aha! Aha! Shut out the sight! \"Aha\" is not only an interjection of startling disclosure, but also (spelled Nin�) a formula enumerating to 7, a number sacred to Bi­nah and Babalon. Sometimes Aha is treated as a lesser Divine Name ofVenus. 54. Holy, Holy, Holy art thou! 55. Light, Life and Love are libe three glow-worms at thy feet: the whole universe of stars, the dewdrops on the grass whereon thou walbest! 56. I am quite blind. Crowley documented that this blindness was physically quite real. He actually believed he had lost his physical sight. As mentioned above, such temporary but total blindness is a known phenomenon sometimes accompanying cosmic consciousness experiences. 57. Thou art Nuit! Strain, strain, strain my whole soul!

The experience is beyond what he had known as Binah; it would seem to be a brief opening to the Ayin Soph Or, the Limitless Light or Qabalistic Zero beyond and behind Kether.

Lucifer, Belial, and Satan are (with Leviathan mentioned earlier) the four \"Great Princes of the Evil of the World,\" best known from the medieval magical classic, The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage. Crowley's identification with them is not only as an incin­erated castoff, but perhaps (in comparison to the reality of the Goddess) as q'lippothic refuse-yet on a sublime scale. 62. Vea!

Sight is fire, and is the first angle of the Tablet; spirit is hearing, and is the centre thereof; thou, therefore, who art all spirit and fire, and hast no duller elements in thy star; thou art come to sight at the end of thy will. And if thou wilt hear the voice of the JEthyr, do thou invoRe it in the night, having no oth­er light but the light of the half moon. Then mayest thou hear the voice, though it may be that thou understandeth it not. Vet shall it be a potent spell, whereby thou mayest lay bare the womb of thine understanding to the violence of CHAOS. His intellect was not fully engaged (which is no surprise). He made small mistakes: Fire is not attributed to the first angle of the elemental tablets, but to the fourth. Though a terribly minor point, it does give a clue as to how displaced Crowley's normal Ruach functioning was. In this phase of his exposure to the 2nd .tEthyr, all that he re­ceived was the unintelligible \"sound and fury.\" He is next coun­seled that if he would like to \"hear the voice of the .tEthyr\" - actu­ally receive an intelligible instruction - he would need to come back in a few days when the Moon would be half full. On this point (though applied to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, rather than this present level of experience), Crowley later wrote in his notes to Liber Samekh: This rapture is accompanied by a tempest of brilliant light, almost always, and also in many cases by an outburst of sound, stupen­dous and sublime ... But it is important that the Adept should not rest in mere inexpressible realization of his rapture, but rouse himself to make the relation submit to analysis, to render it in ra­tional terms, and thereby enlighten his mind and heart in a sense as superior to fanatical enthusiasm as Beethoven's music is to West African war-drums ...

He will by now have become able to converse with his Angel, impossible as it once seemed; for he now knows that the storm of sound which he supposed to be the Voice was only the clamour of his own confusions. The \"in­finity\" nonsense was born of his own inability to think clearly be­yond his limits, just as a Bushman, confronted by numbers above five, can only call them \"many.\" 76.

Before the consciousness of the 1st lEthyr, LIL, he was brought to the utmost stillness. Scarcely was he able to fulfill the duty he had accepted, to make articulate the fruits of his mystical undertaking so that a record existed for those who came behind him. His voice lowered to a whisper. The pace was slow - two hours for a rather small amount of text compared to many of the other visions. The majesty of this vision is, perhaps more than any other thing, in the depth of its silence and peace. I, as well, shall be relatively wordless in the face of most of what he received. What more is there to say? The words brought through speak more eloquently for themselves than any other could speak for them, even in those places where they were, as Crowley noted, \"but a pale reflection in Ruach (and even that at the cost of infinite effort) of the Word of the Angel of the lEthyr.\" They are a song that penetrates directly to the heart. Other than a few remarks to clarify certain technical or contextual points, we leave the body of this vision to the eloquence of the Speaking Si­lence. The name of this cethyr, LIL, had a further, though related, im­portance to Crowley. The letters L.I.L. were the initials of the name of the first magical Order he ever founded, the \"Lamp of the Invisible Light,\" established by him in Mexico in 1900."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"472 Visions & Voices Three things should be noted about this: First, this title still survives as the last phrase of the present vi­sion. It was not at all forgotten by him these nine years later. Second, Mexico in 1900 was when and where Crowley first began to scry these 30 LEthyrs, and where he received the first two visions (those of the 30th and 29th). His selection of the Order's name undoubtedly was connected to his then highest concept of what the climax of the series of visions might bring. Third, the very phrase \"Lamp of Invisible Light\" -simple in its mystical implications, and ecumenically cutting past the outer dif­ferences of every mystical approach to reach a root idea -invokes a vivid, powerful image that remained important to Crowley for many years. It appears to be a name associated with the essence of Kether, which correspondence to the present <ethyr he retained. Though not directly related to the present vision, it is worth ap­pending a brief description of the Order. Crowley's most extensive discussion is in Cap. 23 of Confessions, from which the following is excerpted: I had also a certain amount of latitude granted by Mathers1 to ini­tiate suitable people in partibus. I, therefore, established an entire­ly new Order of my own, called L.I.L.: the 'Lamp of the Invisible Light'. Don Jesus [Medina] became its first High Priest ... The general idea was to have an ever-burning lamp in a temple fur­nished with talismans appropriate to the elemental, planetary and zodiacal forces of nature. Daily invocations were to be performed with the object of making the light itself a consecrated center or focus of spiritual energy. This light would then radiate and auto­matically enlighten such minds as were ready to receive it. Even today, the experiment seems to me interesting and the conception sublime. I am rather sorry that I lost touch with Don Jesus; I should like very much to know how it turned out. So far as we know, Don Jesus was the L.I.L.'s only High Priest. Either due to its failure, or due to the considerable success in its original silent, invisible purpose, nothing at all was ever heard about it from that point on. The L.I.L. is one of the most sublime concepts Crowley ever conceived, perhaps reflecting the innocent purity of his somewhat na'ive mystical youth. The same can be said of the present vision. 1 S.L.

Dawn and its successor, The Cry of the 1st JEthyr LIL 4 73 Uranus and Neptune aligned themselves along the meridian at the time this vision began. Previously in this series, this has nearly always coincided with unusually intense visions. While the reth­yr' s name and number may be the chief causes of the \"unusually intense\" characteristic, it is at least true that the Uranus-Neptune opposition on the angles does not conflict with it. (Uranus re­mained only 4' from exact square to Crowley's Sun, his own inner Lamp oflnvisible Light.) Over the course of two hours, Venus reached the Midheaven -at 3:01 p.m., about three-fourths of the way through, around §26 which is laden with Venus symbols. Venus crossed the Zenith at 1:54 p.m., around §8 when the child first appeared. The Moon was still increasing, not yet quite at First Quarter. Psycho-spiritual vitality, therefore, was generally on the rise. In the Sidereal Zodiac, the Moon remained in Aquarius (Pisces in the Tropical). I can think of no sign symbolism more appropri­ate than that of Aquarius for this vision set against the silent pro­found of space, described in § 1 as \"the veil of night, dark azure, full of countless stars.\" (See Atu XVII, The Star.) No traditional Pisces themes are present unless one counts the general mysticism theme implicit in all of these visions. This vision's song is a song ofliberty (::::Z:), not of indentured servitude {tt). Further emphasizing the liberty aspect, the Moon was sextile Uranus. Also, Mars remained exactly opposite Jupiter, an aspect that does not seem to manifest distinctly amidst this panoply of principles. Something else occurred in the heavens that day, which war­rants our attention. Saturn was Stationary Direct (SD). That is, having been retrograde for many months, it had (to geocentric ap­pearance) stopped in its tracks to begin forward motion. When planets are stationary, either turning retrograde or turning direct, they have much-intensified influence. Think of a hot clothes iron that, while kept in motion, acts much differently than if you stopped and left it sitting on the same spot for an hour, hot side down. Saturn may have been conjunct Crowley's Midheaven at this station; unfortunately, there is imprecision concerning the ex­act minute of his birth, so we cannot say for sure. The Saturn sta­tion may have had an effect on the general astral ambiance as well. As her name in Hebrew, Shabbathai, means \"rest, stillness\" (traits that we have seen emphasized in discussions herein of the Magis-"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"474 Visions & Voices T1\\J.,l:lN ,jc,� ·�n WIT'� !JV 0 ter Templi Grade attributed to Binah), she may have contributed to the still silence of the present vision. The 1st .tEthyr corresponds to Kether in Atziluth in the main scheme we have been employing, and is the third rethyr attributed to Kether in the secondary scheme introduced in the 91h .tEthyr. Additionally, these last three rethyrs have displayed a striking rela­tionship to the first three letters (or last three paths, depending on how you look at it) of the Hebrew alphabet, so that LIL would cor­respond to Aleph, �. The suitability of these correspondences is fairly evident. (They are also attributes known to be present in Crowley's mind.) Which brings us, at last, to the name. LIL or :C1C =Cancer, Sagittarius, Cancer. Samekh, D, Sagittarius, and Cheth, n, Can­cer, are paths of high aspiration and attainment, the paths associat­ed, respectively, with entry into the Second and Third Orders, the attaining of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardi­an Angel and the crossing of the Abyss. Each has a formal instruc­tion named after it -Liber Samekh and Liber Cheth -and these are the primary instructions associated with those two steps. Look at these letters, as well, in the arrangement provided by Liber Tav (above). Not only do Samekh, D, and Cheth, n, appear in the same column (at the end of the second and third rows, mark­ing the climaxes of the First and Second Orders) but, above them, as the primary influence shining down through them, is Aleph, �, The Fool, of which this rethyr appears to be an expression. Place Atu VII, The Chariot (Cheth) and Atu XIV, Art (Sa­mekh) before you, and meditate upon them. That, perhaps, will give you the best understanding of the elements operative in this rethyr.

In its simplest form, this is the value of the letter l7, \"eye,\" and attributed to Capricorn. Crowley thought the symbolism of The Eye important for the gen­eral understanding of this vision. More directly, LIL (like ARN and ZOM before it) is the spelling of an important Hebrew word: �-�.pronounced layiyl, means \"night.\" This \"night\" is much of the fabric of the present vision. There is no doubt that �-� was an important detail already in Crowley's mind related to this vision. In fact, the coexistence of �-� as \"night\" (a basic Nuit idea) and L.I.L. as \"the Lamp of the Invisible Light\" (a basic Hadit idea) pretty much summarizes the whole vision! Together, they bring forth the crowned and conquer­ing child, Horus. Perhaps most importantly, 70 is also the value of the important word 110, sod (pronounced with a Iong-o sound), meaning \"se­cret,\" and referring to \"THE Secret\" of the Mysteries - the highest revelation. At one point early in the vision transcript, Crowley stated that, by the geomancy method, LIL adds to 66. This is only obtainable if you regard L not as Cancer, but as the Moon, giving it the value of l, 3. This is technically correct, since the zodiacal attributions of each letter are really only particularizations of the underlying ruling planet symbolism. The approach was later abandoned, though. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that this summation nudged Crowley to relate the vision overall to �. ( 66 is the sum of the first 11 numbers, i.e., the Mystic Number of the 11th Path on the Tree of Life, �.) Notes on the individual paragraphs will be sparse, for reasons stated previously. 00. First, let praise and worship and honour and glory and great than!:? be given unto the Holy One, who hath permitted us to come thus far, who hath revealed unto us the ineffable mysteries, that they might be disclosed before men. And we humbly be­seech His infinite goodness that he will be pleased to manifest un­to us even the Mystery of the First JEthyr. This invocation was based on a prayer used in the Second Point of the old 5=6 ceremony, and which was popular among Golden Dawn adepts in Crowley's circle. The main part of the original is as follows:"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"476 Visions & Voices Unto Thee, Sole Wise, Sole Mighty and Sole Eternal One, be praise and Glory forever, who has permitted this Aspirant who now kneeleth before Thee to penetrate thus far into the Sanctuary of thy Mysteries. Not unto us, but unto thy Name be the Glory. Let the influence of Thy Divine Ones descend upon his head, and teach him the value of self-sacrifice, so that he shrink not in the hour of trial, but that thus his name may be written on high, and that his Genius may stand in the presence of the Holy Ones, in that hour when the Son of Man is invoked before the Lord of Spir­its and His Name in the presence of the Ancient of Days. o. (Here followeth the Call of the JEthyr.) 1. The veil of the JEthyr is lil:?e the veil of night, dart? azure, full of countless stars. And because the veil is infinite, at first one seeth not the winged globe of the sun that burneth in the centre there­of. Profound peace filleth me,-beyond ecstasy, beyond thought, beyond being itself, IAIDA. (This word means \"I am,\" but in a sense entirely beyond being.) 2. (Note. -In Hebrew letters it adds to 26. In Hebrew letters the name of the JEthyr is 70, ayin; but by turning the Yetziratic attributions of the letters into Hebrew, it gives 66, and 66 is the sum of the numbers from 0 to 11.) If this initial image was a conscious magical formulation, as was Crowley's evident custom in this vision work, then it likely com­bines the blue of Samekh with the star-strewn midnight blue awn­ing of the Chariot. More particularly, it reflects the idea of night, with which Crowley associated LIL, and also reflects the influ­ences of the Aquarius Moon. In its midst is the symbol of Hadit, Who is the Lamp of Invisible Light. Again, and as mentioned above, these Light and Night images seemed to be the most fun­damental a priori ideas Crowley had concerning this rethyr. IAIDA is an Enochian name for God, usually translated \"the Highest.\" It is used in the 1st Enochian Call, which invokes the ac­tive aspect of Spirit. Treated as if it were Hebrew, it enumerates to 26, the value ofrr1il'. 3. Yes; there is peace. There is no tendency of any sort, much less any observation or feeling or impression. There is only a faint con­sciousness, lil:?e the scent of jasmine. 4.

For the light of the Sun mal:?eth illusion, blinding man's eyes to the glory of the stars. And unless he be in the shadow of the earth, he cannot see the stars. So, also, unless he be hidden from the light of life, he cannot behold Nuit. Here, then, do I abide in unalterable midnight, utterly at peace. 6. I have forgotten where I am, and who I am. I am hanging in nothing. This describes his physical, mental, and spiritual state, which were those of very deep, still, yet vital meditation. His primary focus is on the idea of LIL, or ���, as night, even as \"unalterable mid­night.\" 7. Now the veil opens of itself. (To Scribe. Come nearer; I don't want to have to speal:? so loudly.) B. It is a little child covered with lilies and roses. He is supported by countless myriads of Archangels. The Archangels are all the same colourless brilliance, and every one of them is blind. Below the Archangels again are many, many other legions, and so on far below, so far that the eye cannot pierce. And on his forehead, and on his heart, and in his hand, is the secret sigil of the Beast. And of all this the glory is so great that all the spiritual senses fail, and their reflections in the body fail. This infinite profound of night was itself a veil. Most likely, that veil was the World of Briah, and its opening disclosed (so far as Crowley was capable of perceiving it) the unbuffered vision of At­ziluth. (Not entirely unbuffered, though, since the centerpiece of his vision is surrounded and supported by innumerable archangels native to Briah.) \"Colorless brilliance\" is the color (if such it can be called) at­tributed to Kether in Atziluth (King Scale), in contrast to the \"white brilliance\" of Kether in Briah (Queen Scale). This descrip­tion was also used in the Vision of the 2nd JEthyr. The secret \"sigil of the Beast,\" according to Crowley's notes, was the Sun-Moon ligature in the form of <0 Besides its vast uni­tive symbolism (it is equivalent to the rose and cross, lingam and yoni, &c.), it had more complex implications in Crowley's person-"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"478 Visions & Voices al symbol system. The C-like curve before the dotted circle was also an old form of the Greek letters Sigma and Theta, which, in tum, are cognates with the Hebrew Shin, 1V and Teth, D. These, in tum, were to Crowley the \"force and fire\" of Liber L.; his hiero­glyph for the name Set, DID, that appears so commonly in his writ­ings; and, by the Qabalah ofNine Chambers, his earliest synthesis of the number 93.1 This is the same ensign that marked Aiwass in Crowley's vision of his Holy Guardian Angel at the end of the 16th .tEthyr. 9. It is very strange. In my heart is rapture, holy and ineffable, absolutely beyond emotion; beyond even that bliss called Anan­da, infinitely calm and pure. Yet at the gates of mine eyes stand tears, li�e warriors upon the watch, that lean on their spears, lis­tening? 10. The great and terrible Angel �eeps on loo�ing at me, as if to bar me from the vision. There is another blinding my mind. There is another forcing my head down in sleep. 11. (It's very difficult to tal� at all, because an impression ta�es such an immense time to travel from the will to the muscles. Naturally, I've no idea of time.) 12. I have gone up again to the child, led by two Angels, abas­ing my head. 13. This child seems to be the child that one attempted to de-scribe in \"The Garden of Janus.\" \"The Garden of Janus\" is a very long poem originally published in The Winged Beetle. The child is described especially in stanzas XXIV-XXVI, and then woven through the stanzas following. 14. Every volition is inhibited.

These are paragraphs that Crowley specifically marked as \"but a pale reflection in Ruach ... of the Word of the Angel of the .tEth­yr.\" For §34, he added, \"This passage is quite spurious, a vague and false reflection of the true Voice, which was a lyrical sequence of the Atus of Thoth.\" Regarding §35, he noted, \"This passage is"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"482 Visions & Voices not wholly wrong; it is the poor expression which is to be de­plored.\" 36.

The formula here given is the single most powerful \"protective spell\" of all Thelemic magick. It is solidly grounded in important fundamentals that would require long explanation, but the central idea is that, in myth, Harpocrates in invulnerable to all harm. To live in a harmless world, one must, therefore, become like Harpoc­rates. The central key to this frictionless going is to know and do one's True Will. Besides all this theory, the simple truth is: It works. 38.

This is the formula of the JEon, and with that the voice of LIL, that is the Lamp of the Invisible Light, is ended. Amen. One astrological observation has been saved until the end of this commentary, because it pertains to the end. These visions provide a reminder of just how many events in life constitute starting points that have horoscopes of their own. When Aleister Crowley began anew to tackle this series of visions - when he uttered the Call of the 28th lEthyr at 8:00 p.m. November 23, 1909 in Aumale, Algeria - the Moon was at 18°32' Pisces. When he concluded the Vision of the 1st lEthyr at 3:30 p.m. on December 19, in Biskra, climaxing with such a sense of joy, triumph, and promise, Jupiter had reached 18°32' Virgo, exactly opposite that Moon to the mi­nute of arc. The transit is entirely fitting. This opens a whole new area of astrological research on these visions, which we leave to others to take up: their examination as an organic whole that evolved through ongoing transits to the horoscope that started the cycle. At every turn, the heavens speak if we but listen; this is just one more fascinating example of their voice. BISKRA, ALGERIA.

There is no reason to be­lieve Crowley planned this recurring angularity of Venus; but it could not have worked out any better if he had been toting a laptop with 21st Century astrological software. Of all things ever written or received by Aleister Crowley in his lifetime - of all the words that embody both the sacred and the secular literature of Thelema - no passage, not even Chapter I of The Book of the Law, so expresses the means of religious worship of the Divine Feminine as does this short hour of vision and voice. It is a liturgy for the worship of Babalon. 1 In a note to this vision, Crowley recognized its divergence from anything else he had ever written: The Magical Fascination of the whole JEthyr is something quite apart from, and beyond, almost anything else in the experience of 1 It might well serve as the foundation of a true New lEon goddess worship; i.e, one that is not merely an atavistic retrenchment to the Formulre of the Isis lEon dressed up in Horus clothing."},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"486 Visions & Voices the seer. The effect upon him, 31 Equinoxes [15Y:! years] later, of writing these notes is quite extraordinary. The memory of it di­minishes the value of the rest of his life, with few excepted inci­dents, almost to nothing. As prescribed, the Moon is half-full. (Presumably the extra en­ergy of a sufficiently progressed lunar phase was needed.) She is also in exact square to Mercury. This is a bit puzzling, since, in all earlier visions commenced under Moon-Mercury aspects, Crow­ley's intellect predominated. That is not what we see here. We see quite the opposite. Possibly, the difference arises from the fact that Venus here squared Crowley's natal Mercury: His mind and style of expression were inclined toward the poetic, not the mathemati­cal. One other Moon-Mercury characteristic is the intrusion of a 'foreign' language. (In a birth chart, Moon-Mercury aspects are a common mark of easy adaptive facility with non-native lan­guages.) Mars still opposes Jupiter, now only 5' separated. I will stick with the words \"virility\" and \"passion\" for this aspect, in much the same sense as if this were Crowley's honeymoon night. (Read the vision in this light and draw your own conclusions.) Unlike his first three endeavors to penetrate the mysteries of ARN, on this occasion the Moon was in Sidereal Pisces and Trop­ical Aries. There is no ambiguity as to which model of measuring the Moon's location is more valid for this vision: Tropical Aries does not describe the vision at all. In contrast, the mystical Pisces is clearly more descriptive. Pisces' deepest symbolism pertains to mystical union with the mother, a recapitulation of the in utero ex­perience. In contrast to Crowley's earlier explorations of ARNon December 18, when the Moon was in the constellation Aquarius, this vision has neither the intellectual and pedantic quality of his first efforts, nor the startling, mind-exploding, revelatory denuding of the Sanctum Sanctorum of the afternoon attempt. All of those apply well to Aquarius symbolism. This present installment, in contrast, is mysterious, musical, poetic, sweet, and haunting -characteristics of Pisces. Themes previously discussed concerning the rethyr' s name re­main relevant to this segment. The letters of ARN correspond to Taurus, Pisces, and Scorpio. In this vision, the beauty and erotic passion of Taurus-Scorpio join everything mentioned above con­cerning Pisces symbolism. 79. An olvah nu Gil poliax_ in vah ralfj hum f1fala maha. 1 80.

And there is a sort of sub-tinRie of a bell. 81. And there is a string instrument, somewhat liRe a zither. And there is a human voice. This is an example of what Crowley termed \"The Moon Lan­guage,\" or Bathyllic. It appears in some of his received works, and thrice in the present vision. He translated the above lines thus: Now it glides into the heaven-home, glides. Seducingly the men­tula of the begotten one of the Holy Head [or 'Skull'] takes hold of the soft tissues, subtly plying its shuttle. Light follows the ex­plosion. The soft tissues, cleaving to the shuttle, pump out every drop of water from the well. The allusion seems obvious enough, and totally appropriate for an angular Venus aspecting an exact Mars-Jupiter opposition. The musical instruments described help establish the tone of the vision. §§82-86: I have made two changes in the text presentation. First, the translations have been moved to these notes - they were not part of the original vision, and their editorial inclusion interrupts the flow. Also, the song from Liber LXVI has been moved to §86, where it occurred in the vision according to the original manuscript. (In THE EQUINOX it fol­lowed §83.) This last change makes an important difference in our un­derstanding of the text, clarifying that §§82-85 refer to the song in §79. The \"voice\" mentioned in §82, and which speaks in the four verses fol­lowing, is (a representation of) the voice of the Goddess herself. 82. And a voice comes: this is the Song of the Sphinx, which she singeth ever in the ears of men. 83. And it is the song of the syrens. And whoever heareth it is lost. In most classical legends, the Sphinx is female; see especially Oedipus Rex. It is here a symbol both of the feminine and of mys­tery- the deepest sanctuary of mystery. Oedipus' tale returns us to the Piscean psychology of deep desire to return to the intrauterine existence (or \"Garden of Eden\"). The Sphinx barred Oedipus' pas­sage thereto, even as similarly constituted Kerubim were set to"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"488 Visions & Voices guard the entry of Eden. On discovering the Mystery of the Sphinx, Oedipus was rewarded immediately by invitation into the bed of his mother, representing the final, haunting maternal mys­tery on which so much of religion is based. Similar meaning can be given to the \"syrens.\" They refer to se­duction. Yet Sphinx and Siren also both hint at destruction: \"And whoever heareth it is lost.\" Sailing the lEgean, this has one mean­ing; but in mysticism, it more likely has the same import as in Li­ber Legis, 1:61: But to love me is better than all things: if under the night-stars in the desert thou presently bumest mine incense before me, invok­ing me with a pure heart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a little to lie in my bosom. For one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all; but whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose all in that hour ... 84. And that which thou hearest is but the dropping of the dew from my limbs, for I dance in the night, nabed upon the grass, in shadowy places, by running streams. 85. Many are they who have loved the nymphs of the woods, and of the wells, and of the fountains, and of the hills. And of these some were nympholept. For it was not a nymph, but I my­self that walbed upon the earth tabing my pleasure. So also there were many images of Pan, and men adored them, and as a beautiful god he made their olives bear double and their vines increase; but some were slain by the god, for it was I that had woven the garlands about him. 86.

Liber LXVI (Liber Stelke Rubece) had been received two years ear­lier. It was the fourth of the Holy Books, preceded only by Libri CCXX, LXV, and VII. At this juncture, Neuburg's original tran­scription of the 2nd .tEthyr simply says, \"[Song in Book LXVI.]\" The text of the song was added later, at the time of publication. I have conformed the song's typography to the original in Liber LXVI. Here is Crowley's translation of this song: I. Silence! the moon ceaseth (her motion),/ That also was sweet/ In the air, in the air, in the air!/ Who Will shall attain!/ Who Will shall attain/ By the Moon, and by Myself, and by the Angel of the Lord! II. Now Silence ceaseth! And the moon waxeth sweet;/ (It is the hour of) Initiation, Intiation, Initiation./ The kiss of Isis is honeyed;/ My own Will is ended,/ For Will hath attained. III. Behold the lion-child swimmeth (in the heaven)/ And the moon reeleth:-/ (It is) Thou! (It is) Thou!

So sweet is this song that no one could resist it.

Spacing and juxtaposition of the text in the original manuscript in­fer that §87 discusses \"Omiiri,\" &c. that follows. Its translation is: I am the harlot that shaketh Death./ This shaking giveth the Peace of Satiate Lust./ Immortality jetteth from my skull,/ And music from my vulva./ Immortality jetteth from my vulva also,/ For my Whoredom is a sweet scent like a seven-stringed instrument,/ Played unto God the Invisible, the all-ruler,/ That goeth along giv­ing the shrill scream of orgasm. The last word of the song, hrzliu, is worth further comment. It is best known from Liber XV, Crowley's so-called \"Gnostic Mass\" missal, where the priest and priestess utter it together as they per­form an act symbolic of sexual union. Usually, it is explained as the sound of a dove - the descent of the Holy Spirit at the moment of their shared orgasm - and, if said with the right technique it does, in fact, make a not-too-absurd birdcall. But its origin is right here, in this vision, where it is translated as \"the shrill scream of orgasm.\" Enumerated as if it were Greek (as its form suggests), the word is ptAtF = 156, the same value as the name BABALON. 88.

The voice of the Goddess continues to express her nature. The vi­sion's climax has been reached. 89. Now I perceive myself standing in a Druid circle, in an im­mense open plain. 90. A whole series of beautiful visions of deserts and sunsets and islands in the sea, green beyond imagination.... But there is no subsistence in them. A parade of visionary images. The mystic's rational mind is be­ginning to reassert itself. Note, though, that even these phantoms all are very beautiful. 91. A voice goes on: this is the holiness of fruitless love and aimless toil. For in doing the thing for the thing's sal:?e is concentration, and this is the holiness of them that suit not the means to the end. For therein is faith and sympathy and a l:?nowledge of the true Magic!:?. This is the voice of Binah, the Sanctifying Consciousness. Con­centration is a keyword of Saturn: In the way this word is used in yoga, it provides many clues to the sometimes obscure or paradox­ical attributes of Saturn. This present verse explains an important method of the Master of the Temple (i.e., an initiate of Binah), whereby one \"loses oneself' in every impression. By this total, concentrated surrendering to each experience, each becomes a sac­rament. 92. Oh my beloved, that fliest in the air lil:?e a dove, beware of the falcon! oh my beloved, that springest upon the earth lil:?e a gazelle, beware of the lion! 93. There are hundreds of visions, trampling over one another. In each one the Angel of the JEthyr is mysteriously hidden . These are phenomena of the reasserting Ruach. Yet, there is an important mystery even in these: It is that the Goddess wears in­numerable faces. She can be seen behind the face of each woman one loves or ever has loved. Each feature of nature veils her. All is her masquerade, her layered robes, her veils. In all things wherein"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"492 Visions & Voices She is sought, She is found-provided one loves that within which one seeks Her. 94. Now I will describe the Angel of the JEthyr until the voice be­gins again. 95. He is liRe one's idea of Sappho and Calypso, and all seduc­tive and deadly things; heavy eye-lids, long lashes, a face liRe ivory, wonderful barbaric jewellery, intensely red lips, a very small mouth, tiny ears, a Grecian face. Over the shoulders is a blacR robe with a green collar; the robe is spangled with golden stars; the tunic is a pure soft blue. Notice the colors and details. They suggest Gimel (blue) and Da­leth (green) combined with Binah (indigo or black). 96. Now the whole JEthyr is swallowed up in a forest of un­quenchable fire, and fearlessly through it all a snow-white eagle flies. And the eagle cries: the house also of death. Come away! The volume of the booR is open, the Angel waiteth without, for the summer is at hand. Come away! For the JEon is measured, and thy span allotted. Come away! For the mighty sounds have entered into every angle. And they have awaRened the Angels of the JEthyrs that slept these three hundred years. At the end of ARN is the letter N, which, in Enochian as in He­brew, corresponds to the sign Scorpio. Scorpio represents the de­vouring aspect of the Goddess. Her \"unquenchable fire\" portrays this. She is Neshamah (ID). We are taught, in the course of initia­tion, that this fire renews all of nature (the Nephesh). Her avatar is shown as the White Eagle of alchemy (and, in Crowley's mind at that time, a symbol of Scorpio in its most exalted and purified as­pect, in many respects the same symbol as the white rose seen previously). As Scorpio, this is \"the house also of death.\" Also, this passage is a paraphrase of part of the 11th Enochian Call, which reads: and the Eagle spake and cried with a loud voice: Come away! And they gathered themselves together and became the house of death ... \"The volume of the book is open ... \" This is the book that was sealed in the 30th lEthyr at the beginning of this series -from a vi­sion Crowley had obtained nearly a decade before - now closing the circle of� The fourth boatl symbolism� that book said, J '� Until the .Batt�� the Voice�. ·.• Look not Death whick · Four: Five ..... turn!

Until the hour sound! Until the Voice vibrate! Until it pierce my Depth; Look not on High! Look not Beneath! For thou wilt find a life which is a Death or a Death which should be infmite. For Thou art submitted to the Four: Five thou shalt find, but Seven is lone and far. .. Return! Re­turn! Return! For the work is ended; and the Book is shut ... Return he did- in one sense then, and, nine years later, in an­other sense. He attained and met the Seven that, years before, was \"lone and far.\" And he found the life promised. In his last hour of exploring the 30 Aires, his first hour with them was fulfilled. 97. For in the Holy letter Shin, that is the Resurrection in the Boo� of Thoth, that is the Holy Spirit in the Trinity, that is three hun­dred in the tale of the years, hath the tomb been opened, so that this great wisdom might be revealed. The 300 years correspond to 'tV, the transforming Fire of supercon­sciousness. At first, we are led to think that these refer to the time elapsed since Dee and Kelley first forged channels of communica­tion with the Enochian angels. Looking further, we find a deeper matter; for, in 1909, three centuries had just elapsed since those events described in Fama Fraternitatis. According to that work, in 1604 \"the tomb [was] opened, so that this great wisdom might be revealed.\" A 300-year cycle has marked the evolution of the initiated Western Mysteries. 1312: The Order of the Temple (Knights Templar) was dismantled, and its final Grand Master (Jacques de Molay) burned at the stake two years later. 1604: The Fama Fra­ternitatis was written. It was privately circulated (1610), then in 1612 openly published. 1904: Liber Legis was received by Aleister Crowley in Cairo. It was privately circulated (1909), then openly published in 1912 in THE EQUINOX No. 10. 98. Come away!

On December 20, 1909, on the eve of the Winter Solstice, what meaning might \"remaineth\" have had? I can only conceive that this is the same construction em­ployed in Liber L. 2:9, \"they pass & are done; but there is that which remains.\" In this dawning of the .tEon of the Child, all else having be­come completed and passed away, nothing more remains ... except that ONE \"unto whom be the glory throughout all the .tEon.\" 99. Come away! For that which was to be accomplished is ac­complished, seeing that thou hadst faith unto the end of all. 100. In the letter N the Voice of the JEthyr is ended. N is the last letter of ARN. It is the letter of Scorpio, which, we observed at the beginning of this study, describes better than any other symbol Aleister Crowley's journey in this cycle of workings, and Her that was the heart of his Work. In Qabalah, Scorpio has the attribute of motion: it represents that ONE THING that flows onward continually, without interruption. The form it wears changes constantly, but its underlying reality is unperturbed. In this final reminder that DEATH = ECSTASY, and that the Eternity the mystic seeks is found through the gates of death and dissolution, the Vision and the Voice are brought to their close.

It is also refer­enced and discussed, albeit obliquely, in numerous places in Aleister Crowley's public writings. Finally, here are some words enumerating to 93 in the Latin Simplex Qabalah: AL VEL LEGIS-(Titles of The Book of the Law) GARGOPHIAS-Q'lippothic spirit ofGimel (per Liber 231) KURGASIAX-Q'lippothic spirit ofKaph (per Liber 231) LIBER LIBERI-\"Book of [the god] Liber;\" title of Liber VII LUNA MATER-\"The Moon is its Mother\" (cf Emerald Tablet) OMNIA AB UNO-All from one REGULUS-The little king; brightest star in the constellation Leo, Cor Leonis, \"the heart of the Lion.\" SATURNIA-Juno (daughter of Saturn) Our Sun, source of Light and Life, is 93 million miles from Earth. This is a rarely mentioned key to the whole series of ideas associated with the number 93. To put it in perspective: On March 20, 1904 E.V. (the actual date of the \"Equinox of the Gods\" at which the LEon of Horus was announced), Crowley summarized part of the communication he received by writing, \"I am to formu-late a new link oflll gural concept of� Additionally, t1 pure number.

Additionally, there are some meanings of 93 that are based on pure number. Its prime factors are 3 x 31; and 31 is a number cen­tral to The Book of the Law, especially through the Name ��. In Hebrew, 93 is written .l�, Tzaddi (90) and Gimel (3). These letters correspond to the Tarot Trumps called The Emperor (IV) and The Priestess (II). Meditation on these two cards can be ex­pected to yield a deeper, fundamental, and independent idea of the number 93. Even a first glance reveals The Emperor as a symbol of paternal Will, and The Priestess (the Uniting Consciousness) as a symbol of maternal Love. Similarly, the Tarot Trumps numbered 9 and 3 are The Hermit (a symbol of Will) and The Empress (a sym­bol of Love). Thus, 93, again, represents Will and Love. 93 is the value of the three Hebrew letters (1, t:l, :J) corre­sponding to the three \"reciprocal paths\" (the three horizontal paths on the Tree of Life). They correspond, respectively, to Venus, Leo (or the Sun), and Mars; or to Tarot Trumps III, The Empress; XI, Lust; and XVI, The Tower. When the ten Sephiroth are traced in numerical sequence, the Tree of Life is said to be formed in the shape of a Lightning Flash. The Hebrew letters whose paths are traced in this Lightning Flash are�, 1, .l, t:l, �, J, :J, 1, n. (Gimel, .l, is actually a substitu­tion into the pattern, to compensate for there being no direct path between Binah and Chesed. There are mystical reasons that this substitution is sound.) When the numerical values of these nine letters are totaled, the result is 777 -hence the name of the book wherein Crowley compiled correspondences of the various parts of the Tree of Life. However, if instead of the Hebrew letters them­selves, we total the numbers on the Tarot Trumps attributed to them, we get: 0 + 3 + 2 + 11 + 8 + 13 + 16 + 19 + 21 = 93! In many of Crowley's writings, he employed a magical formula involving the letters Teth (t:l) and Shin ('!Z7). They represent \"Force\" and \"Fire,\" among other important correspondences; they may be examined in more detail, for example, in the notes appended to the ritual of Liber Reguli in Magick in Theory & Practice.

In The Vision & the Voice, the relationship of the aspiring Adept to Babalon is gradually disclosed. Her name is actually the word for \"harlot\" in the Enochian language; but in the Hebrew (ll7?�J.�J.) and Greek (Baj3W.ov) alphabets, it enumer­ates to 156. The term \"City of Pyramids\" refers to 156 in another way. Each of the four Enochian \"watchtowers,\" or elemental tablets, consists of 12 columns of 13 squares, or 156 squares in all. In a three-dimensional model of these tablets (originating from within the Second Order of the Golden Dawn), each of these 156 squares is represented by a truncated pyramid. In the Great Seal of the A:. A:. , not only do the letters of the name BABALON mark the seven points of the heptagram, but the seven sevens in the center are arranged in an adaptation of the mathe­matical equation 77 + (7+7) + 7 + 77 = 156. Other words or phrases enumerating to 156 are symbolically related to Babalon: Zion, ,,��, is a designation of Binah. The phrase \"Bride and Queen,\" a title of the Divine Feminine used in the G .D. 1 = 1 0 ceremony (at the very moment when the first of the Enochian Watchtowers is being activated) is, in Hebrew, Kallah ve-Malkah, i1:::> ?7.J1 i1?:::>, or 156. In the Cry of the 2nd JEthyr (a vi­sion of Babalon), the word Hriliu is heard, translated as \"the shrill scream of orgasm;\" written in Greek, as PiAtF, it enumerates to 156.

Usually, such atypical representation is a clue that a Qabalistic author has hidden additional information.

More commonly is light, not night, employed as the metaphor for spiritual awakening. Words such as \"enlightenment\" and \"illu­mination\" reiterate this metaphor. From the rites of Freemasonry to New Age chachkas, from Eleusis and The Bible to the rituals of the Golden Dawn, it is Light that the aspirant claims to seek. Yet beyond this Light is a Night - not an infernal darkness, but a Supernal Darkness. Not a subterranean lightlessness, cut off from the Sun's illumination, but the rich, velvety depths of space which exceed the modest shell of earth's reflecting atmosphere. It is our intellect that we analogize to elemental Air; and, beyond this small Ruach-shell of our personal psyches, is a transpersonal Night, an ecstasy and bliss of illimitable love. \"This light guided me,\" St. John wrote of the luminous hegemon of his heart, \"more surely than the light of noonday/ To the place where he (well I knew who!) was awaiting me .... \" These are the words of an Adept already awake in the Sphere of the Sun. Yet, on this occasion for St. John, it was \"a place where none ap­peared.\" He addressed his inner sanctuary newly: \"Oh, night that guided me,/ Oh night more lovely than the dawn,/ Oh night that joined Beloved with lover,/ Lover transformed in the Beloved.\" His final poetic, preambling passage discloses what he experienced in the blackness: \"I remained, lost in oblivion;/ My face I reclined on the Beloved./ All ceased and I abandoned myself,/ Leaving my cares forgotten among the lilies.\" This is the Night of Binah, Saturn, which hungrily draws for­ward the 'Lover' or Adept, even as the Light of Tiphereth, the Sun, lifts up the aspi.ram·· ceeds the Light -� that it overflows 3111111 an absence of all • void.\" \"When they. the greatest deligbtjj when they believe.� brightly upon th� and shuts against dill al water which � long as. they des· ·•·.· out: It 1s so great · Divine Love) ex� dom says: be st:roiiJI canst thou bear� All of this is � her 210.

It is the Night that ex­ceeds the Light - a Night, in fact, comprising so intense a Light that it overflows and paralyzes the sensorium, thus appearing to be an absence of all things. It is nequaquam vacuum, \"nowhere, a void.\" \"When they are going about these spiritual exercises with the greatest delight and pleasure,\" St. John later commented, \"and when they believe that the sun of Divine favour is shining most brightly upon them, God turns all this light of theirs into darkness, and shuts against them the door and the source of the sweet spiritu­al water which they were tasting in God whensoever and for as long as they desired.\" Yet it is not really a deprivation or a shutting out: It is so great an intensification that the Divine Light (which is Divine Love) exceeds the psyche's ability to assimilate it. \"Wis­dom says: be strong,\" The Book of the Law counsels us. \"Then canst thou bear more joy.\" All of this is preamble to understanding the nature of the num­ber 210. In the Order of the Golden Dawn, the attainment of Tiph­ereth was represented by symbols of Light, and by mysteries of the Latin word for \"light,\" lux, coded into its three letters, L.V.X., all of which can be traced in the arms of a cross, +. Many of their se­crets were summarized in the number 120. When Aleister Crowley began to experience levels of spiritual growth reaching beyond those of Tiphereth - and especially when he re­ceived the channeled holy text of Liber Liberi and, a couple of years later, the instruction of the higher Enochian .tEthyrs recorded as The Vision & the Voice-he began to employ the same sym­bol as St. John of the Cross, that of Night. Build­ing on the Golden Dawn's lead, he represented the attainment of the Supemals by the Latin word for \"night,\" nox, especially as coded into its three letters, N.O.X. He enumerated these letters by analogizing them to Hebrew as :y:l7:J (Nun A'ayin Tzaddi), which enumerate not to 120, but to 210. Furthermore, he traced the form of the Roman letters N, 0, and X in the shape of the crossed circle, ®, as in the illustration above. Crowley came to regard 210, based on its numeral sequence alone, to be a superior symbol of attainment than was 120 (which"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"508 Visions & Voices he regarded as an earlier stage of development).1 He understood 210 as \"the reduction of duality [2] to unity [1], and thence to neg­ativity [0], and ... thus a hieroglyph of the Great Work,\" according to a note in The Book of Lies. The Two that become One dissolve together into Nothing. Besides its strong Binah symbolism, 210 is also related to the letter Y od, �, because Y od is the 20th Path on the Tree of Life and 210 is the sum of all positive integers from 1 through 20. It is, therefore, the \"Mystic Number\" of the 20th Path. Furthermore, 210 is written in Hebrew as �1, Resh Y od, as if to draw our attention first to the symbol of the Sun (1), and then to the Secret Seed, or Virgin Center, of the Sun-the True Will and Secret Self C). 210 is the value of several Hebrew words commonly used to symbolize spiritual attainment: 1ilil (ha-har)- The mountain (Ex. 3:12) i11il (herah)- To the mountain (Gen. 14:10) 111 (vered)-A rose j''1�1 (ve-tzaddeeq)- And the righteous (Ex. 23:7; referring to the ho­ly ones) '1� 11J -YJ, \"hawk\" (in plenitude) = Horus Many other words, in Hebrew and Greek, appear to refer espe­cially to the Binah attainment through the image of Babalon, or Shakti, or some similar goddess, and references to love and sexual­ity. Others refer more overtly to magick and its methods. Some of these words refer to both.

The verses weren't numbered in the original. Crowley numbered them later. The structure is, however, fairly evident from the original. Many Thelemites regard the verse numbering as fun­damental to the interpretive architecture of the Book. Others dis­pute this. In any case, Crowley himself counted 220 verses, and eventually catalogued Liber L. as Liber CCXX: This is the most important value of this number for Thelemites. Crowley summarized his understanding of the number as fol­lows: \"It represents 10 x 22, i.e., the whole of the Law welded into one. Hence we may be sure that the Law shall stand as it is without a syllable of addition.\" His reference was to the 10 sephiroth and 22 paths, the Qabalistic model of the Tree of Life in the exact manner first explained to him during his 5=6 initiation in 1900. This brings us to the central importance of the number 220 prior to the dictation of Liber Legis. It is one of the key numbers of Rosicrucianism. The Rosicrucian tradition is founded on Fama Fraternitatis, dating from the early 1 ih Century. The Fama is the tale of an aspirant identified only as C.R. or C.R.C. Some interpret this to mean Christian Rosy Cross (or Rosencreutz). More im­portant to our present topic, though, are the initials. He founded a fraternity with the initials R.C. One of their very few rules was that, \"The word C.R. should be their Seal, Mark, and Character.\" To this day, the Inner College of the A:.A:. is called, simply, R.C., despite Golden Dawn precedents to the contrary. The Fama is a Qabalistic work. The German letters C.R., or R.C., are equivalent to the Hebrew :1:J, Kaph Resh. These enu­merate to 220. There are many­one's \"Seal, Mark,� signature.

These enu-Appendix A 511 There are many possible meanings of this C.R., or R.C., being one's \"Seal, Mark, and Character.\" It surely meant more than just a signature. In Hebrew, these letters, as 11, spell two words. The first is rake, which means the \"softness\" or \"tenderness,\" of a green shoot. From this is derived rakh, \"compassion.\" In modem spiritual fellowships that base their teachings on Rosicrucian tradi­tions, it is common to interpret this as meaning that compassion shall be the \"Seal, Mark, and Character\" of those who follow these teachings. No wonder, then, that Liber Legis 2:21 defines compassion as the distinctive \"vice of kings,\" viz., of Adepts. Resh and Kaph are the letters of the Sun and Jupiter, the planets of royalty and aristoc­racy. Along the same lines, 220 is the value of 1�n::::1, bachiyr, meaning \"The Elect\" or \"Chosen.\" 220 corresponds to other words and ideas of great importance to mysteries of the Rosy Cross, especially as expressed in Tipher­eth. Chief of these is �111, varedi, \"rosy.\" Others include n1lil, ha-zerach, \"the rising,\" specifically used as \"sunrise\" (Gen. 32:32, Ex. 22:2) and \"the rising light\" (!sa. 58: 12); the related word, iln1l, zar'chah, \"be risen\" (Ex. 22:2), and n11�i1, ha-orach, \"path, road, way,\" used to mean \"The Path.\" Reversing the letters, as C.R., we find the Hebrew 1:J, kar, \"lamb.\" This had obvious importance to a Christian interpretation of \"Frater C.R.\" as an image of Christ. But the idea goes deeper. These two letters mark the initial sound of names of numerous ma­jor \"redeemer heroes\" through history, including Christ and Krish­na. The aspirated K (a \"soft\" Kaph) also matches by sound the hard Ch, which is the initial of Chiram (the Masonic hero-name Hiram). And there are more. But, for our purposes, surely the most important is that the oldest form of the Egyptian name Horus is Chaar, spelled with two characters exactly equivalent to the He­brew letters 1:J, or C.R. 220 is also the sum of the Mystic Numbers of all 10 Sephiroth: 1 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 15 + 21 + 28 + 36 + 45 +55. It, therefore, defines the Tree of Life in a second way, additional to being 10 x 22. To the sephirah Y esod, The 32 Paths of Wisdom attributes the Pure Intelligence.

Abrahadabra (�n­J�1�i1�1J�) enumerates to 418. Crowley was quite familiar with this word and its number long before The Book of the Law was dictated to him. He had derived the formula of Abrahadabra years earlier, in 1900. His work is summarized in \"An Essay Upon Number,\" written in August 1901 and later printed in THE EQUINOX No.5. Beginning on page 116 of EQUINOX No. 5, he reproduced his long Qabalistic analysis of Abrahadabra, which I will not repeat in the present article. This analysis is also given, in briefer form, in Sepher Sephiroth under the number 418. The most important points of the analysis are: First, the word consists of 11 letters, this being a number sa­cred to magick in general, and the completion of the Great Work in particular. Second, these 11 letters consist of five A's and six consonants, referring to the five-pointed pentagram (traditionally called the \"pentalpha,\" lit., \"five A's\"), symbol of the Microcosm, and the six-pointed hexagram, symbol of the Macrocosm; and to the equi­libration of these symbols in the 5°=6° formula of the Adeptus Minor Grade. Therefore, \"Abrahadabra\" is chiefly a formula of superconsciousness, of the uniting of the microcosm and macro­cosm in the experience we call the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, the central event of the Adeptus Minor Grade.

Many of these are given in this present article. Abrahadabra and 418 are specifically mentioned in The Book of the Law. In fact, this number is one of the few actually men­tioned in that book, and not merely implied or subsequently de­rived by Qabalistic analysis (as was the number 93). References to these in Liber Legis include: ... They shall worship thy name, foursquare, mystic, wonderful, the number of the man; and the name of thy house 418. [2:78] Abrahadabra; the reward of Ra Hoor Khut.[3: 1] ... one cometh after him, whence I say not, who shall discover the Key of it all. Then this line drawn is a key: then this circle squared in its failure is a key also. And Abrahadabra. It shall be his child & that strangely. Let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can he fall from it. [3:47] The ending of the words is the Word Abrahadabra. [3:75] According to Crowley, \"Abrahadabra\" is also the word intend­ed much earlier in Liber Legis, in 1 :20: \"The key of the rituals is in the secret word which I have given unto him.\" There also is refer­ence to Abrahadabra and 418 in other Class A Documents of A:.A:.; for example: Eight times he cried aloud, and by eight and by eight shall I count Thy favours, Oh Thou Elevenfold God 418! (Liber VII 4:45) Verse 11 of each chapter of Liber Ararita also uses this num­ber, the combined references to 11 and 418 implying Abrahadabra (which is an 11-lettered word). For example, in Cap. 1 of that book is a verse which summarizes much that we have already men­tioned: Also I welded together the Flaming Star and the Sixfold Star in the forge of my soul, and behold! a new star 418 that is above all these."},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"516 Visions & Voices During the Vision of the 2ih lEthyr of The Vision & the Voice, Crowley was told by the communicating angel that the Word of the lEon was Makhashanah. Since he already knew this word to be Abrahadabra, he initially thought this a proof that he should not trust what the angel was telling him; but on adding up the word (i1J�ID�::>�T.J), he found that it came to 418, and was, therefore, the \"correct\" word under a veil. Furthermore, this form of the word, which (like Abrahadabra) had 11 letters in English, had only eight letters in Hebrew, which was more suitable to the particular formu­la being communicated to him in the 27th .tEthyr. Many Thelemic researchers have found that 418 has helped them understand other parts of Liber Legis. For example: In Greek, 418=AtFacrc;, Aiwass, the name of the being who dictated Liber Legis to Crowley, whom Crowley subsequently identified as his Holy Guardian Angel. (Alternatively, Isrrel Re­gardie once pointed out that, in the Ashkenazi dialect of Hebrew, in which the soft Tav is pronounced \"s,\" Aiwass can be written n�,��= 418.) Previously, we saw that, in Hebrew, this name is l1�l7 = 93, forming a natural relationship between 93 and 418. Thus, when Crowley attributed the authorship of The Book of the Law to \"93=418,\" it was to Aiwass that he specifically referred. The quote given above from Liber L. 2:78 refers to \"the name of thy house\" as being 418. Crowley initially understood this as r=>ID'?1:l, a Hebrew transliteration of \"Boleskine,\" the name of his house in Scotland at the time. However, other efforts have been made to interpret this mystery. Crowley proposed a solution in the phrase �:l:l� n�:l, beyth abba, \"House of the Father;\" however there is a flaw in this, since the Hebrew word abba is spelled �:l�, with only one :l. A much simpler, and more direct, solution, which I have proposed, is the single word 1n�:l, beytho, meaning \"his house\" (Gen. 12:17, 14:14). The quote above from Liber L. 3:47 refers to a \"line drawn\" on page 60 of the original manuscript. This line, evidently drawn in a single stroke, touches only the letters S T B T I I Say FA. If the F is given a value of 6, these letters add to- yes, you guessed it-418. Soror Meral (Phyllis Seckler) discovered that \"Bes-na-maut,\" the name of Ankh-f-n-khonsu's father given in Liber L. 3:38, may is, in the native C Within the Heru-Ra-Ha, and What may weB fj the number 418 is � \"beast\" (Gen. 1 :25)� 666 from The A� earlier and later) ci 666, and the Grec:tfj here is an alternate I wise obscure ref� Liber L. apparen�� \"my name.\" F� he was living in � equivalent of this a ' These are only� number found in 71 words enumeratingJ •n:lil� (ahav'tee)-11i1 11� (Or H� ,�, m� (eth IA0)3 �1i1 iln� (attah a. masculine� culine expressil 1:::l n':::l (beyth 1J11111 tion (lies) n'IDI'J '17J1 ( damlli IDn l '17J1 ( damui .j These are Crowle!

Within the pantheon of Liber Legis, we find that �i1-�1-11i1, Heru-Ra-Ha, and 111i1-�1, Ra-Hoor, both enumerate to 418.1 What may well be the original detail that attracted Crowley to the number 418 is that it is the value of n�n, khaiyath, meaning \"beast\" (Gen. 1 :25). He had long identified himself with the Beast 666 from The Apocalypse. Although this identification was (both earlier and later) expressed especially through the solar number 666, and the Greek phrase TO 1-lEYa SflptOv (\"the great beast\"), here is an alternate interpretation in Hebrew. It explains his other­wise obscure reference, in an unpublished Qabalistic analysis of Liber L. apparently dating from 1904, to 418 being the value of \"my name.\" Furthermore, at the time Liber L. was dictated to him, he was living in Egypt under a pseudonym which was the Persian equivalent of this Hebrew khaiyath: Chio Khan, \"the great beast.\" These are only some of the more interesting associations of the number found in The Book of the Law itself. Some other Hebrew words enumerating to 418 include: 'n:lil� (ahav'tee)-I love (Gen. 27:4) 11il 11� (Or Heru)- The Light of Horus2 1�' n� (eth lAO)-The essence ofiAO �1il iln� (attah Hu)-\"Thou\" and \"He,\" or \"Thou art He!\" (iln� is the masculine word for \"you.\" This phrase is, therefore, a wholly mas­culine expression of God in the second and third person.) 1:::1 n':::l (beyth bad) - House of an oil press, or of fabric, or of fabrica­tion (lies) n'IDr.J '17.J1 (damui mashiyach)- Like unto the Messiah IDnJ '1r.J1 (damui nachesh)-Like unto the serpent These are Crowley's transliterations. I would not have transliterated \"Ra­Hoor\" that way. But he did, then used these values repeatedly in his work, so the student should be prepared to recognize them.

This, of course, is exactly what we expect from exploring any physical place, and is part of what gives these visions their sense of authenticity, the feeling that one is not merely running wild with imagination but, rather, is visiting an actual, objective place. Many magicians have privately explored these rethyrs in the century since Crowley did so. Their results (as expected) have been mixed because the travellers have been a mixed batch, di­verse in personality type, life conditions, and technical skills. Be­cause students often ask for other examples of such visions, I de­cided to pull out samples from my own diaries, scryings of the 29th and 27th JEthyrs.1 The vision of the 29th JEthyr seemed a particularly good exam­ple because of both differences and similarities to Crowley's paral­lel vision: It differs widely from what Crowley experienced-i.e., the actual story seems entirely different - and yet underlying themes so exactly fit that in places is seems one vision looks in on the other.2 Imagine two vacationers visiting the same spot where These are two of four examples (30th through 27th JEthyrs) originally pub­lished in BLACK PEARL, Vol. II, No. 1 (Los Angeles: College of Thelema, 2002). 2 These sample were chosen for publication also because they are far less personal than most of my Enochian visions, which generally have a tendency to intermix extreme eroticism with kundalini movements and, after the 26th, inti-"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"522 Visions & Voices local events made international news, but being somewhat oblivi­ous to the local details ... until they got home and caught up on the backlogged stack of newspapers (or the digital equivalent).

It is all being borne away indif­ferently by the currents which seem to flow at once both to and from all directions in their ubiquitous fury. I ask, \"Is there not one who can survive this?\" For I know I am concerned about humanity and its heritage. The angel says only, \"You are here.\" And I understand. This flood, deluge, downpour is the sweeping and razing current of the new .tEon which is wiping the earth clean - clean of that which had been accumulated atop it. In truth, nothing shall be left. But there is one who, as witness, cames on. And I reach up to heaven and receive the lightning that blasts down, its fiery threads surging about and through me as well, and out my arms and hands. I feel nothing in this, yet see and confirm it; 1 yet there is no place to direct it, nothing toward which to apply it. I am Prometheus,2 asking that the lightning of Zeus be that heavenly fire which I may receive and carry down to humanity. And in this, I at once realize that the currents of the flood, and the currents of this lighting, are both currents, are both flowing, though one be of water and the other of fire.3 And the lightning is the fire of heaven, the o�T.JIDi1 ID� [Esh ha-Shamayim] which shall enlighten and empower humanity, as a knowledge of electric­ity reveals; but this lightning is more, as well. It is the current of the new .tEon, the current which at once washes all away in confu­sion and turmoil - nay, even with such force and speed that it leaves no time for confusion and turmoil. It only washes away. And the storm continues. And the lightning seeds the waters, and flames through me that I might give it. Yet to whom, and how, I know yet not. That is, the actuality of the lightning, etc. 2 \"Prometheus\" was my sacramental name (or 'magical motto') at that time .

Her hair is shoulder length and dark brown, and she stands revealed to me, even as the fury seems to abate just a little, and the storm shows the barest signs of calming. I ask what I am to do, yet know what I am to do. I ask, \"It has been claimed that The Book of the Law is the fruit of the Enochian hierarchy\" (and in this I found myself thinking of Babalon as its font); \"Is it so?'' And the angel answered: \"It is so, and it is not so; for it is more as well. This shall rule and this shall teach! This shall rule and this shall teach! The crowned and conquering child is Himself as a current that flows and surges like a mighty river and shall not be stopped. He beareth humanity in the wake of his stream, through the gloom, and through the resolution of its iniqui­ty, in the arms and by the stem and unyielding goad of She who is love and all blessing.

To light! To light! She calls; but the way is to, in turn, embrace what we call the darkness.

And it has a loud, loud roar like a huge, deafening waterfall. As I begin to move through this, the kundalini moves in my physical body as well (for I am \"here\" and \"there\" at once), easily reaching the heart and beginning its movement to the throat. As this happens, I emerge from the other side of the veil into a wholly new scene. It is a garden, in bright, bright sunlight. The yel­low of the Sun and the green of the foliage are nearly the only col­ors I see; and my inner senses are also impacted by a greenness of color and energy that is even more subtly behind all of this, though not physically visible. Then I am surrounded by roses, red roses of all types. The kundalini movement continues, and it is as if my in­terior gently is dilated before its amazing flow, and my body and soul are saturated with pleasure. Pleasure is almost the only word or idea that comes to me. It is pleasure, pleasure. This is the Gar­den of Pleasure, the 1117 p?

I ask why I am here, and what I am to do here in this garden. She asks me what I wish to do; for it seems the options are endless. I say I seek to walk the Path­way of Light to its end, in the embrace of Babalon. Her acknowledgment of this is almost missed in the immediacy of the effect. The kundalini flow strengthens. I expand into the sunlight. The pleasure increases and nearly dissolves me.

Isis tells me this is the veil of the Inner Teacher and, knowing this ONE, I easily surrender the veil to understand Him who is silent speech and invisible, who is with me always.

Throughout this book, constant refer­ence is made to a less familiar framework titled the Sidereal Zodi­ac. All that most people know about the Sidereal Zodiac is that sign placements usually shift one sign backwards. Yet, despite this relative obscurity, the Sidereal Zodiac, and the associated approach to astrology put forth by pioneer Cyril Fagan and his coworkers, has revolutionized astrological research and practice over the last 60 to 70 years. Even after allowing every rea­sonable concession to its challengers, honesty still requires the fol­lowing conclusive findings of fact: 1. The Tropical Zodiac is a fiction. It simply does not exist, except in the minds of its proponents. 2. The Sidereal zodiac- the same zodiac that was used from astrology's dawn -exists objectively, has demonstrable empirical and statistical validity, and is the only legitimate zodiac existing in Nature. These are strong statements, I know. They are backed up by strong facts . One can always take a gracious, tolerant high road, of course, and not insist too loudly on either of these points. Such gracious tolerance takes the form of minding one's own business and, if pressed on the issue, saying that someone may, of course, use whatever approach they wish.

I ask my readers to consider that neither graciousness, a so­cial emollient, nor tolerance, a respect and acceptance of others' beliefs and choices, has much to do with science - with the facts. Those noble virtues are enemies of scientific truth. Perhaps I merely repeat the error that Frater C.R.C. made in Spain, \"showing unto them the errors of our arts, and how they might be corrected, and from whence they should gather the true indicia of the times to come, and wherein they ought to agree with those things that are past.\" I may well find that, despite the passage of six centuries, \"it is to them a laughing matter; and being a new thing unto them, they fear that their great name would be lessened if they should now again begin to learn, and acknowledge their many years' errors, to which they were accustomed, and where­with they had gained them enough.\" I can only respond, as did his true brethren, \"Whoso loves unquietness, let him be reformed.\"1 Here follows an overview of what the Sidereal zodiac is, its modem history, and some of the main categories of the arguments for its authenticity.2 BASIC DESCRIPTION The Sidereal Zodiac, like the more familiar Tropical Zodiac currently used by most Western astrologers, is divided into 12 equal segments of 30° each. These divisions bear the familiar names Aries, Taurus, Gemini, etc. The basic difference is that the start of the Tropical Zodiac (0° Cf) is permanently identified with the northern hemisphere vernal equinoctial point, while the Sidere­al Zodiac is measured in a way that fixes it against the starry celes­tial backdrop; or, more accurately, against the universe as a whole. The quotations are from Fama Fraternitatis. 2 This Appendix is an overview. The sections below require more detail to substantiate the flat claims made.

Because the vernal point moves against the same celestial backdrop (due to precession of the equinoxes), the Tropi­cal Zodiac is in constant backwards motion in relation to the Side­real Zodiac: It slips backward 1 o every 72 years, or one sign in about 2,200 years. As a result, \"signs\" of the same name in these zodiacs do not presently occupy the same areas of space. SOLAR & LUNAR RETURNS In 1944, Cyril Fagan discovered the superiority of Sidereal So­lar and Lunar Returns (\"Solunars\") over their Tropical counter­parts. These \"returns\" are charts cast annually or monthly (respec­tively) for the Sun or Moon's return to its natal position. Sidereal returns, calculated in a precession-free reference frame, yield quite different results from Tropical returns. For example, the difference in the time of a Solar Return amounts to a whole day at age 72. The literature on this subject is very rich, though much is out of print. You may be able to find two books on the subject: Solar & Lunar Returns by Donald A. Bradley (1948) and Interpreting Solar Returns by James A. Eshelman (1985). THE SPICA ZODIAC Fagan began favoring the use of a sidereal, or non-precessing (\"fixed\"), zodiac such as Eastern astrologers have used for millen­nia. He felt it made more sense than continuing to use a precessing (tropical) zodiac and deleting precession for prediction purposes. Sidereal sign-placements also began to provide solutions for many confusing problems of astrological symbolism. For example, Tropical astrologers have long recognized the frequency of major military leaders having the Sun in Libra, ruled by peace-loving Venus; it makes much more sense Sidereally, for their Suns are in strategic Virgo, the fall ofVenus. Similarly, Trop­ical Taurus, the other Venus-ruled sign, is packed with history's leading military dictators and political mass-murderers; it is far better symbolism that these individuals have the Sun in political,"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"540 Visions & Voices military, bloody, Mars-ruled Aries, as is true in the Sidereal Zodi­ac. These are two of many dozens of examples that could be of­fered to show the type of superior symbolism Fagan noticed. In this early, formative stage of Western Sidereal astrology, Fagan tentatively adopted the leading Hindu stellar zodiac, which fixes the star Spica at 0°00'00\" Libra for all time. This zodiac dif­fered from the contemporary Tropical Zodiac by about 23 ° in the mid-1940s. PROFESSION & BIRTH DATE Donald Bradley entered the scene in the late 1940s. Then an established advocate of the Tropical Zodiac, Bradley undertook what was then the largest, most carefully performed statistical ex­amination of astrology's fundamental precepts. Published in 1950 as Profession and Birth Date, Bradley's study of 2,492 eminent clergymen surprised him by indicating that, while twelve equal di­visions of the zodiac do exist, their boundaries are not where Trop­ical theory places them. In fact, Bradley's statistical work suggest­ed that, in the 1940s, a new sign began about where the Tropical Zodiac marks 24 ° of each sign, not at oo. Bradley continued this avenue of research over the remaining quarter century of his life. Under his pen name Garth Allen, he published a consolidation of the cumulative results shortly before his death. The statistical concepts and fascinating factual implica­tions cannot be summarized in a few sentences, but can be ex­plained easily even to lay readers who have a bit of patience. They lead to explorations not only of statistics, but also of zodiacal sym­bolism, mythology, and practical interpretation. The reader is re­ferred to the citations at the end of this Appendix. BULL'S-EYE! Bradley's statistical determination (that, in the 201h Century, a new sign began where the Tropical Zodiac marks 24° of each sign) differed by 1 o from Fagan's initial speculation. Bradley noted that this purely empirical determination (which has since been replicat­ed with other large data samples) carried further symbolic virtues.

Appendix D 541 For instance, it placed the star Aldebaran, \"the Bull's Eye,\" exactly at 15° Taurus, the \"bull's-eye\" of this original first sign of the zo­diac, opposite Antares, \"the heart of the scorpion,\" at 15° Scorpio. Spica, symbolically the sheaf of wheat in Virgo's hands, was shift­ed from oo Libra to 29° Virgo, anchoring the last degree of the original zodiac. Shortly thereafter, Fagan verified these speculations when he solved the mystery of the origin of traditional exaltation degrees (see Zodiacs Old & New), thereby determining to the nearest de­gree the boundaries of the ancient Egypto-Babylonian zodiac. The exaltation degrees (hypsomata) were decisively identified as par­ticular planetary positions in the year 7g6 BCE. This solution re­quired that the Vernal Equinox, in 7g6 BCE, occur at 14° ry>. Fagan combined this information with observations of two great Babylonian astronomers, Naburiannu and Kidinnu. The for­mer placed the vernal point in 500 BCE at 1 oo ry>. The latter, working 127 years later in 373 BCE, placed the VP at go ry>. These three figures are not in disagreement: Rather, since the equinoxes precess 1° every 72 years, the positions (in round degrees) of 14 ° ry> in 7g6 BCE, 10° ry> 2g6 years later, and go ry> 127 years after that all define the same framework; and, projecting this forward into the mid-20th Century, the VP would be expected at 6° �' ex­actly where Bradley's statistical findings placed it (24° earlier than where Tropical astrologers placed it). Spica, therefore, was officially shifted, by Fagan, Bradley, and others who had by that time joined them, to 29 JU>OO'OO\". Yet, no single \"fixed\" star can reasonably be presumed to de­termine the structure of the entire zodiac. These Sidereal longi­tudes of Spica, Aldebaran, Antares, etc. were known to be near­approximations at best, and not precise \"permanent markers\" by which a zodiac is defined. The Sidereal Zodiac is not simply a cir­cle in the sky with a designated starting point; rather, it is the re­sultant of the harmonic interplay of all galactic and extra-galactic material, visible and invisible, in the universe. That is, the Sidereal Zodiac is a \"field\" in which the relative positions of the planets produce astrological effects, a concept by no means out of align­ment with either progressive physics or Thelemic cosmology."},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"542 Visions & Voices SOLAR & LUNAR INGRESSES In 1956, a dozen years after Fagan's initial discovery, Bradley began investigating Sidereal Solar and Lunar Cardinal Ingresses, i.e., charts for the moments that the Sun or Moon entered one of the Sidereal Cardinal signs. The accuracy of his calculations natu­rally depended on knowing the exact locations of Sidereal 0°00'00\" Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. A half-degree error in these points would displace the timing of a Lunar Ingress by about an hour, or of a Solar Ingress by about 12 hours. Initially, the Solar Ingress results were quite disappointing. Si­dereal Lunar Ingresses, however, were exceptionally illuminating in describing, as Bradley wrote, \"momentous events of every kind ranging from tornadoes to assassinations, from conflagrations to royal weddings.\" He found that by adjusting the zero-point by only 0°06', these Lunar Ingresses were often perfect in their symbolic representations of socio-political events and natural phenomena. Spica was temporarily redefined as marking 29 flll06. These six minutes of arc altered by about 2 Yz hours the timing of Solar Ingresses, miraculously transforming them, like the Lunar Ingresses, into valid mundane predictive charts. A further adjust­ment of only 0°00'05\" produced the most significant \"polishing\" improvement on this already pleasing technique. Spica, therefore, was redefined as marking 29flll06'05\" for the epoch 1950.0, placing the mean longitude of the VP at 5H57'28\".64 for the same point in time. This defines what Bradley named the Synetic Vernal Point (S.V.P.), utilized by Western Siderealists since 1957. It is pre­sumed to be in error by no more than a few seconds (if that much). Thus, no longer are the boundaries of the twelve zodiacal divisions even nominally dependent on any single star with its own proper motion, but rather on a truly sidereal matrix that encompasses the entirety of space.

Appendix D 543 Investigating Sidereal Lunar Capricorn Ingresses (\"Caplunars\") for record rainfalls, he found that Jupiter, lord of thunderstorms and bountiful rains, appeared near the angles of these charts at the lo­calities of the all-time record-setting cloud-bursters many times more than normal expectation would allow. Further pursuit of this led to a grant from the National Science Foundation administered by New York University to continue this research and related stud­ies. When they computer-crunched 90 years of U.S. rainfall rec­ords from every reporting station in the country, this \"Jupiter ef­fect\" was awesomely replicated. In Caplunars for the dates and places of 49,576 maximum precipitation events, Jupiter's presence on the Caplunar angles was so incomprehensibly frequent that it exceeded normal expectation by a staggering 15 standard devia­tions. (I say \"staggering\" because there may not be a z-score table that counts this high. The odds against such a result occurring purely by chance are effectively 0%.) Naturally these results depend upon knowing the correct place­ment of the Sidereal 0° Capricorn. They lend considerable support to claims concerning the authenticity of the Sidereal Zodiac. THE ARCIIJEOLOGISTS CONCURRED The second corroboration, from archaeological sources and non-astrological scholars who study the history of astrology and astronomy, was unknown to either Fagan or Bradley. In 1958 (a year after Bradley's published determination of the S.V.P.), Peter Huber published some noteworthy findings on the Babylonian zo­diac. In order to determine the boundaries of the zodiac the ancient Babylonians used, Huber compared the calculated dates of plane­tary conjunctions with certain stars, as recorded in Babylonian as­tronomical texts. Huber's conclusions, published in the German journal Centaurus (1958, Vol. IX, pp. 192-208), were that the Babylonian zodiac, adjusted to the epoch 101 BCE, placed the VP at 4ry'l28 ±20'. The Fagan-Bradley S.V.P., for the same epoch, lo­cates the VP at 4 ry'l27, agreeing within 0°01' of arc!"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"544 Visions & Voices REFERENCES • Solar and Lunar Returns by Donald A.
