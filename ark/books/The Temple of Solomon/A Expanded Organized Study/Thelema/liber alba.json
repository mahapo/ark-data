People write to me from all over theworld; some of them are considerate enough to use English. So I am quiteused to strange requests. A few people only want an autograph. Some seekadvice on a variety of subjects: gardening, teenage sons and the StockExchange being the most popular. Then we have those who insist onlaunching into long and lurid lists of their most intimate personal problems.At first, I was not ready for this, and my chest hair turned quite white.Magical requests can take one aback too. It is startling enough to be asked tocure warts, give tips for the Grand National, or choose six numbers for theNational Lottery – but one positively gasps to be told the date of a drivingtest or to be sent the full team-list for a football match and those playersmarked with an ‘x’ whom I should bring down with dysentery dead on 3-0pm. I have even been asked to cripple unfaithful husbands with anexcruciating form of impotence. The most alarming ... and in many ways themost perplexing ... was the demand that I kindly cure a nanny-goat ofapparent Lesbian tendencies – or failing that, get her in kid without the aid ofa billy-goat!Interesting topics, you will agree, but most people who write to me wish firstand foremost to know more about Occultism. Fair enough, you might think.The snag is, though, that they all begin by asking identical questions. Ohyes! Each one is asking for the first time, of course, and therefore each oneimagines that I will be delighted if not actually electrified. He thinks that heis so stimulating and original that I will forthwith embrace him as an equal,offer him instant membership of the Secret Council, and name him as myspiritual successor! And they can become quite difficult when I don’t.Well, rather than repeat myself endlessly, I decided to produce a sheet ofanswers in advance. Not only would this give the more rabid inquisitors ahint, it would also save wear and tear on my nerves. There were so manyquestions, though, that the sheet became a pamphlet, and then the pamphletbecame a small book. This electronic document is only the latest version,and I’m sure there will be more to come.I hope you’ll feel encouraged to explore further. If you would like to knowmore, then all you have to do is ... ask. I and my associates are alwayshappy to help in whatever way we can.With best wishes.AMADO CROWLEY"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Table of ContentsAbout this publicationAleister CrowleyPersonal IssuesGodThe basis of OccultismOther PathsModern ProgressFirst stepsMastersStyle of teachingPracticalitiesStudentsFateSense of humourBeing an OccultistRitualsStatusOccult OrdersKnowledgeEsotericaMagicSpecial powersBlack MagicA Magician’s wrathGood and EvilSexHomosexualitySpiritsWiccaFeminismPolitics and religion‘Causes’‘Spreading the word’Becoming a StudentMaybe I’m stupid...The next stepClick on the title above to go to the chapter"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"About this publication1. Is all this a clever device to trap new students?No, but if it were, would I be likely to admit it? Would I evenhave included this question? I’d have done everything possibleto avoid rousing your suspicions. Some organisations turn outstuff that is disguised as something else: e.g. guides tomeditation, poetry, or science fiction stories, and they uselanguage chosen by specialists in the art of persuasion. They are‘spin doctors’ who do everything possible to catch yourattention and draw you deeper in.When someone enquires into spiritual matters, he yearns forrock-solid belief that he can rely on. He wants ‘certainty’ and isnervous about being disappointed. He has searched a long timeand has often been disappointed. He half-expects to be let downagain and braces himself. But in preparing himself for lies andbeing duped once more, he fails to recognise truth when itcomes along. He lets the genuine article slip through his fingers.If I had to trap students as if they were rabbits – I’d resignand take up ten-pin bowling! In any case, I am not writing thisbook for strangers to Occultism, but for people like yourselfwho have declared an interest. Nobody is making you read it. Ifyou’re afraid, just put it down and go your merry way.2. What is the purpose of this book then?Well, it is not a compendium of ‘all there is to know aboutOccultism’. It isn’t even a summary. That is the kind of materialthat committed students would read, but you don’t know yet ifyou want to be a student or not. So this book gives enoughinformation for you to make a choice. There are so many mythsand misunderstandings to do with Occultism that most peopleknow either nothing or the wrong things. This book will clear"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the air by putting it all in perspective. The last thing I want isstudents who are reluctant, but I am glad to meet people who areyoung and keen to learn.3. How were the questions chosen?They are the ones most commonly asked by would-be students.Newcomers to Occultism are not always anxious to meet me.Perhaps they fear I have hoofs, horns and a six-foot tail! Besideswhich, I am a very busy man, always on the go. So they maketheir first move by writing to me and asking me loads ofquestions. The trouble is that each individual usually asks thesame ones, and I find myself giving the same answers over andover again. So, by bringing the most common ones together in abook, I’m hoping to save time. Then, if and when we meet,we’ll be able to deal with more advanced stuff instead of gettingbogged down in preliminaries.4. Is it wrong to be careful?No, but you’d do better to resolve your anxiety. In spiritualmatters, being careful can become an excuse for doing nothing,and for dodging the hard work needed to pick one’s wayforward. Besides which, some sects are quite notorious for theirpersistence; they don’t take no for an answer but resort to high-powered techniques of persuasion. Once you open the door, youcan’t get a word in edgeways. As a consequence, many peoplemistake eloquence for a hard sell and they are suspicious ofanyone who can explain himself well.Matters are not helped by the fact that, by its very nature, abook is one-sided. The author does all the talking and the poorreader cannot answer back. This can be most infuriating. I try toavoid this pitfall by doing everything in my power to makeLiber Alba sound relaxed and informal. This is why I haveadopted a Question and Answer format and write in a chattytone."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"5. Why ‘push’ Occultism in this book?Your use of the word ‘push’ is interesting. I am not aiming toovercome your ‘resistance’– though it may be your aim to offerit. First of all, there is nothing to stop you laughing at my ideas –you are quite free either to reject or accept them. Second, I havewritten the book with a particular audience in mind, namely,those people who have expressed an interest and who would liketo be helped to understand. If you compare my tone with thetactics used by a political party, with the material offered by areligious organisation, or with the sales brochures of motormanufacturers – you will notice a difference. Try reading one ofthose books that purport to deal with ‘New Age’ stuff: I thinkyou’ll find that one contains more ‘meat’, while the othercontains more ‘padding’. I have nothing to sell. I only offer toshare.6. Will this book try to convert me?Are you deeply religious then? One can only be converted fromone thing to another. If you already had a faith then I don’timagine that you’d be reading a book like this anyway. In anycase, I don’t look at souls in terms of sheep whose fleece hasbeen marked with blue crayon by rival shepherds. Neither do Ilook on religion as a prairie that has to be divided up by barbed-wire fencing. Each person should enjoy the freedom to work outhis own conscience. So, the answer to the question is: no, thisbook is not trying to convert anyone. I don’t hold withconversion. Occultism may be at odds with many otherreligions, but we are happy whenever someone finds a faithwhich helps them. We do not try to ‘rescue’ those who are notlost or ‘save’ people against their will.7. Are you trying to lure me into Occultism?Excuse me for suggesting this, but don’t you think you’re beinga bit big-headed? What kind of pleasure would I derive from"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"doing a thing like that? What kind of joy would it give me? Youmight have reason to be suspicious of me if we got paid areward – so much per head – or if we got commission of somekind. (We don’t, by the way. I promise you, there is noinducement or incentive, worse luck!) But let me turn the tablesand ask you this: what on earth makes you think that you mighteven be ready for Occultism?8. Then what do you want from me?Again, I don’t mean to fence with you, but I was under theimpression that you wanted something from me! You didindicate that you had an interest in Occultism, that you wouldlike to know more about it, and that you might even considerbecoming a student – if you were satisfied by my credentials, ofcourse. Well, if any of this is true then it might be moreappropriate if you adopted a stance that was a little less cocky.Allow me to mention that there is a limit to the number ofstudents that I can accept at any one time. Let me also point outthat there is rather a long queue of candidates waiting. Iwouldn’t want to make you anxious or nervous – but a prudentperson would at least try to be polite.9. Shouldn't you be nice to people?I am nice – very nice – on condition that they are polite, but alasan interest in Occultism is no indication of good breeding. Justas nervous dogs can bite your hand, so twitchy people canbehave quite horribly. There is also another point to be made –that I am only an Occult Master and not a saint. I am a bit of awanderer who doesn’t stay long in any one place. I have nofixed address – no home, no shop, no market stall and no centralheadquarters. As a consequence, most people contact me byletter or by e-mail, and very rarely by astral projection."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Each individual thinks that his letter is unique, and that noone else has ever written to me in quite so brilliant a way. Hesees me as some sort of Egyptian mummy whose lid has notbeen lifted since the sarcophagus was heaved into the pyramid.And he expects me to be shower him with gratitude – to rewardhim with either the secret of eternal life or Cleopatra’s mobilephone number. I’m afraid that such people are quite bitter whenI fail fully to appreciate the honour that they do me.10. Should I take the plunge?I don’t know about that. Why speak of plunges anyway?Occultism isn’t something to which, from the word go, you musteither commit yourself or quit. We are not terribly sensitive andwe don’t feel dreadfully offended if you want to have a lookbefore you propose marriage.Why not proceed in at a moderate pace and in a reasonablemanner? Go forward one step at a time, always looking whereyou put your feet, and don’t go beyond a certain point unlessyou know that you’ll be safe. After all, there is no danger here.Not now. This is only a book and you can chuck it out of thewindow if you get windy. So what purpose does it serve tobehave as if you were a fly and I were a spider offering yousticky toast and honey? Don’t overdo the caution!When they do pluck up the courage to ask about Occultism,I think that people deserve a reply, provided that they aregenuinely interested. Some of them are just having a bit of fun,or filling in the time while they shelter from bouts of boredomor depression. But nobody who reads a book like this is likely tobe totally detached or one hundred percent neutral. Are you?Are you eager and impartial, or hostile and biased? Ah, thatdepends on what fears are lurking in your heart."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Generally speaking, it would be wrong to rush intoOccultism with gay abandon. By all means look before you leap,but, on the other hand, try not to be intellectually stubborn. I amquite happy to try and satisfy the reasonable qualms of a normal,average person, but I am most unhappy if someone tries to pushme into a silly, no-win situation.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Aleister Crowley1. Are you really the son of Aleister Crowley?Look: I am almost seventy years old. I have been telling thesame story ever since I was only a child of seven. If I am a liar,then I started at a very young age. If it is all a delusion then ithas persisted longer than any other in medical history. What ismore, I have told the same story consistently throughout mylong life, and I continued to do so even when it would havesuited me to drop it. There were times when I was livingvirtually a double-life – yet even at the peak of my professionalcareer, I maintained my role as an Occult Master in spite of thefact that I risked total disaster. Yes, I am exactly who I say I am.I am the biological son of Aleister Crowley.2. But are you an impostor?You must be naïve to think that I would ever confess to you.You are quite free either to believe or to disbelieve – but isn’tthat irrelevant right at this moment? What kind of peoplebecome impostors? What kind of personality do they have andwhat on earth is their motive? To suggest that I would go to suchlengths, make such an effort, you would have to demonstratethat I had something to gain.Now you have read all about Aleister Crowley; you knowwhat kind of a man he was and how he ended up. They calledhim ‘the wickedest man in the world’ and ‘the most evil manwho ever lived’. If I was going to be an impostor, wouldn’t Ihave chosen someone else for my father? .. someone rich? ..someone with an enviable reputation? It has been no great joybeing Aleister Crowley’s son. It has brought me neither gainnor good fortune, and I have never tried to exploit my name. Sothe answer is: no, I am not an impostor. I am a proud andindependent old age pensioner. Read my books more carefully."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"3. But are there cheats in Occultism?There are cheats in every religion. Nothing is so sacred thatsomeone won’t hesitate to practice on the gullible. But it is notmy job to pass judgement on such people. I have other things todo. Is that young lady a cheat for charging tourists a high fee forreading the tarot cards? Are those shops dishonest for sellingmagic potions and amulets to dropouts and university students?What shall we say about training courses that award diplomas inhealing? Or those psychic mediums who comfort the bereavedby putting them in touch with the spirits of the dead?Where do you draw the line? How do you distinguishbetween piety and sharp practice? Yes, if you want to be verystrict, you could put the label ‘confidence trickster’ on manypeople’s backs - but equally you could call them actors,entertainers, or beggars. It all depends on your own standpointand how you choose to look at them. In the vast majority ofcases, they are not criminals and they are doing no harm.4. Why do you stress your link with Crowley?I don’t actually emphasise it; I simply treat it as a fact. Whyshould that strike you as odd? If you read my books, you’ll findthat I am none too reverential about my father, so I am notclaiming that anything special was transmitted to me by myfather’s blood. Other people who barely even met him, speak asif they were the greatest living experts on the subject, keepers ofthe sacred flame, and heirs to his mantle ... yet they were nevereven taught any magic by him!Please try to be fair with me. My own teachings do not relyon those of my father and I spend a great deal of my timeexplaining (but not excusing) the more regrettable aspects of hischaracter. I don’t boast about my relationship; I just don’t go outof my way to deny it. In any case, an imposture would not only"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"have legal implications, but also magical ones—the spirit ofAleister Crowley would soon sort things out!5. Is that a threat?No, it is a timely warning aimed at certain organisations, but I’mnot surprised if someone sees it as a threat. I am proud of myfather. I owe him respect and I defend his memory. It's badenough that so many old friends denounce him for a scoundrel,and I'm not going to let them continue making a good living outof their disloyalty. Clearly, it would be all too easy to go alongwith the popular view of Aleister Crowley, but he was a prolificwriter and, if he had still been alive, he would be developing histeachings further. Things would have gone on changing.I stand where he would have stood if he had still been alive.In fact, Aleister Crowley lives on in me and what I do, I do withhis approval, authority and blessing. Sorry if that offends you –sorry for you, I mean. He was not the first and I will not be thelast. It’s not the name that matters, nor even the title. Whatreally counts is: what the ‘Wearer of the Mantle’ has to say.6. Why was Aleister anti-Semitic?He wasn't, but he did not support the Zionist posture and for thisJewish sources tend to label him anti-Semitic. He did not acceptthat the Jews were a favoured race with a special spiritualdestiny. In any case, an intelligent observer can see that Jewishpeople are themselves extremely racist, elitist and xenophobic. Itwas a tragic fact that the Teutonic myth of ‘Aryan supremacy’was doomed to clash with the Jewish myth of ‘chosen people’.These were two, quite incompatible cultures that made the so-called ‘holocaust’ inevitable; but the seeds of that monstrousextermination programme had been sown over several precedingcenturies."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"7. Was Aleister Crowley a paragon of virtue then?Oh come on! No need for sarcasm. Aleister Crowley displayedfew of the traditional Christian virtues, yet both he and mymother were true to their own beliefs. I think that my fatherdisplayed honour and integrity. But why do you ask? Whatprovokes your question? The man has been dead for more thanhalf a century, and reasonable people should be able to discuss atopic without getting personal. If you feel an inner urge to resortto offensive innuendo then I doubt if you are ready to embark onthe sacred quest.Aleister Crowley's parents had strict, repressive views. Atschool, he found an atmosphere of restrained rebellion. So hechampioned an open-minded search for truth. My mother grewin poverty and a climate of gypsy freedom. Her unusual spiritattracted Aleister's eye and together they may have influencedmy own writing. Malicious rumour has it that I imagine myselfto be the Son of God. No, not at all! My parents don’t evenqualify as saints. I award your question ten out of ten for cheek,but zero for tact.8. Did Aleister favour American Occultism?Like most people who are actually born in Europe – as opposedto those who just have European blood in their veins – Aleisterlearned to keep a safe distance from most Americans. Theythemselves quite proudly agree that they are ‘loud, obnoxiousand over here!’ The USA has developed an advanced, first classeconomy by dint of sheer belligerence, and by putting NumberOne first. It is a generalisation, I know, but they are not aterribly spiritual nation; there is a world of difference betweensincere, deeply held piety and the kind of well-orchestratedrazzmatazz that is a feature of American ritual.."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"A large part of American Occultism has either a politicalslant or else it has links with organised crime. Furthermore,without being offensive, the USA is well-known for‘Americanising’ things. They imagine that this is animprovement. In the field of esoteric knowledge, Honey, thisjust ain’t so! Americanisation seeks to modernise, but in fact itvulgarises. It reduces things to their lowest, commondenominator. The motto seems to be: minimum refinement,quickest turnover, maximum profit.9. Isn't this hostile?Yes, it is – and that hostility is quite deeply felt. If you are notAmerican yourself, then you might find it quite hard to comeacross any citizens of that country who felt wounded by myopinions. They are quite able to laugh at their own shortcomings and to dismiss outside opinions as totally wrong andsuspect.I am scathing about American Occultists because theyattacked me without cause. They were so upset by my presenceon this earth that they accused me of trying to enrich myself byusing the Crowley name. This was a bit thick considering thatthey have themselves raked in over $64 million in this verysame way. Apart from that, no, I don’t dislike all Americans.10. Do people's reactions annoy you?There are many different reactions. Some people drop their jawand totter out of the room. Others accost me and try to pick afight. One or two even invite me to read their minds, though Ialways excuse myself on the grounds that there are too manymisprints!When they learn that I am Amado Crowley, some folk canget boorish. I’m used to it now. On a good day, such behaviourpours off me like water off a duck's back. On bad days, I’m"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"more easily provoked and then I'm afraid I react. Beyond certainlimits, I forget that I'm a gentleman and wade in like an OccultRambo.11. Do they vex you deliberately?Some do it for a dare, a bit like children ringing your doorbelland running away. Others are motivated by malice. There are afew who hope to see a psychic firework display. I’m an OccultMaster, when all’s said and done. I’m the son of AleisterCrowley. So people challenge me. ‘Prove it,’ they taunt. ‘Go on,do some magic.’ This is why I don’t drink – to avoid the risk ofever losing control.So why do I behave like a reluctant bridegroom who is tooshy to go upstairs? The answer is that displays of power areforbidden – to a white magician at least. The reasons are: (1)they take away the freedom to disbelieve, (2) they tell the enemyhow you would fight a war, and (3) they drain the power that isbest kept for other things. I protect myself with humour.Laughter lets you win by just not losing.12. Does Occultism have saints and sacred relics?It has its share. Crowley is a famous name, for example. Unkindpeople say that I must be making stacks of money out of it.When I point out that I am as poor as a holy man should be, theysneer and say I must have stashed it away. – a classic ‘Catch 22’situation.Mediaeval towns were jealous of sacred shrines: holy relicscould mean an economic boom and miracles could helprecovery. The Church sanctioned cults here and there. To helpSpain, Pope Pius IX sent the body of Saint Felix as a birthdaypresent to Queen Isabel II.

On his deathbed, W.C.Fields said,‘On the whole, I'd rather be in Philadelphia!’ Was it a joke madewith his last breath – or a reminder that Philadelphia is Greekfor: ‘the city of brotherly love’?13. People say Aleister Crowley was evil.No, it is widely assumed. This is due to newspapers which knewthat ‘scandal and shock’ boost sales. My father was not abootlicker and he made many enemies. Not the least of whichwere the Freemasons. Even so, he worked as a British SecretAgent in both World Wars, and became party to information thatcould endanger the Royal Family. To be safe, certain patriotsthought it best to assassinate his character before the truth cameout! Aleister Crowley was the greatest Magus of his age. He wasalso an incorrigible practical joker, which made him a badpublicist.14. Are Aleister Crowley's teachings still honoured?Yes, but not necessarily followed. One has to distinguishbetween the substance of his teachings, and his way of putting itacross. My techniques are different, and this explains a greatdeal. I have cleared away a lot of his ornament and his tendencyto mystify. This was most evident in his love of the Egyptianveneer! In his own day, of course, Egypt was all the rage andEurope was staggered by the intellectual implications of it all.But of itself, this does not mean that the Egyptian religion heldor hid anything of great value.Some of AC's more foolish followers read more into mattersthan Crowley had ever intended. So they make films, writemusic, or churn out books which say nothing new - but say itvery impressively. I often wonder what it is that these people arereally seeking. Is it the money, the prestige, or the revenge?"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"15. Are you true to Aleister Crowley?Of course. My technique and emphasis differ but my goals areexactly the same. I'm his son, after all and he did teach mehimself. Don't you think that puts me in a better position thanmost to say what is, and what is not, true to my father's spirit?But Crowley was not the Founder of Occultism; he only servedit.

Where is my motive?I've been a Magus and a Master for nearly fifty years, and I canhonestly say that my main source of income is my Old AgePension. Most of my life, I have hidden my identity from nastypeople. If I were a rogue or a con man you might expect me tobe trying to profit from my imposture, e.g., by selling souvenirs,marketing knickknacks, or peddling spells. Since I have neverstooped to such practices, since I have always striven to upholdmy integrity, and since my story has been consistent for a goodmany years, then the odds are that I am indeed the man I say Iam.Yes, there remains the remote possibility that I am sufferingfrom some psychological affliction, such as Munchausen’sSyndrome, that prompts me to deny my humble origins and drablife by inventing a more important and more colourful set ofbiographical facts, just to make myself more interesting. In fact,I have spent a lot of my life avoiding this kind of interest and, inany case, there would be other indicators, additional symptomsand glaring gaps in my story.Old sayings and proverbs often express a profound truth.The common observation that pots have a tendency to accusekettles of being black is a good example. The very people whogo out of their way to impute my motives may be doing so todivert attention away from their own. I have expressed myselfquite willing to offer proof, and to demonstrate my magicalabilities, but they do not even decline – they pretend not to haveheard."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"2. Are your motives altruistic?Nothing as simple as that. I am trying to be true to instructionswhich I believe to have been sent from the Beyond. This is notthe moment to talk of God, Gods, or supernatural power, butthat is what I'm involved in. I hesitate to discuss these mattersmore deeply merely because I don't want to awaken any fears inyour mind, and I don't want to ‘impress’ you. I would muchrather explain things, so that then you will be able to choose. Iconsider that I work in order to help others and I have beenprovided with all that I need to accomplish that task. I don't justtalk or write books. That is to do with communication. I also dopractical work and show how magic applies to daily life. Butthis book is not a polemic nor a party manifesto. My only aim isto soothe your qualms by supplying a sort of ‘Guide forPilgrims’.3. May I have a photograph?I'm sorry, no. Firstly, I don't know who you really are, so I donot know what ‘else’ you might do with my photograph.Secondly, I have kept my civil identity hidden for fifty years andI'm not going to put temptation in your way. However, in orderto make my mind up about you as a candidate for occultapprenticeship, I would like to have a good photograph of youso that I can ‘read’ your character. If all goes well then, one day,we shall meet. When that happens, instead of a merephotograph, you will have the man himself, in full, threedimensional reality. You will be able to feel my bumps, read mypalm, or form whatever judgement you wished.4. Why should I trust you?You know of me. You know my reputation.

But a dog would be able to do that unlesssomeone had been cruel to him.6. Then you think I should be as simple as a dog?Do you suggest that I should prefer people because they aremore complex, because they can dissemble and lie, or becausetheir fidelity and love is short-lived? A dog will die for themaster it loves. Occult students tend to have emotions that aremuch less reliable. Until I know you better, I would not flatteryou by comparing you to a dog.7. Have you written other things?Yes. I am also a playwright and a novelist, though I use othernames. I'm not sure that any of these other activities would meetwith success if they were attributed to Amado Crowley, my realname. But I have produced a book of short stories which mixhorror, sex and magic. And a play of mine was produced in1994 in London. Both of these were designed to captureattention and widen people's horizons. If they appear to work, Iwill take the experiment further.8. Do you exaggerate?I use artistic licence. In order to make a point or to render scenesmore vivid, it is permissible to paint them in brighter colours orto formulate one's words better. The intention though is not todescribe but simply to aid your memory."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"9. Are you a cynic?I hope not. But like a doctor who works in the Emergency Ward,I am shocked by the damage that people do to themselves. As Ilook at the ruins and the wrecks, I almost feel like punishingthem for behaving so stupidly. Perhaps we should pass a testbefore we can get a licence to be left in charge of a brain? Still,all that is part of my job. I must do it, but I can't say that Ialways enjoy doing it. Especially when the victims don't eventhank you.10.

Does ‘God’ exist?All our ancestors thought so, as do most people alive today. Initself, this is no proof, but it is at least a piece of tellingevidence. No explorer ever found a tribe that was atheist. Oncehuman beings had evolved, they thought about their conditionand wondered about the purpose of their existence.The concept of God is unique to Man. Dogs don't readscripture, sheep don't hold rituals, and cats don't sing hymns – ornot very well. Yet human beings do all these things. Is it due toour biology or having an advanced brain? Well, it’s just as likelythat we have a supernatural propensity which God planted in oursouls. We won’t get very far by asking this kind of question.If you mean: ‘Does an Occultist believe in God and thesupernatural?’, the answer is ‘yes and no’. But I am not going tobrainwash you or impose my beliefs on you. You don't have totoe a party line. You may sort out your own beliefs, as and whenyou wish. After all ... there is only the one Truth.2. What is the origin of ‘Truth’?Ought I to know? Should the answer come out pat? A questionmay be easy to ask but that doesn't mean that an answer evenexists, let alone that it could be expressed in simple words. Thiskind of attitude is unreasonable. It is typical of man's tendencyto think without discipline. This would be ok for everydaypurposes but it just won't do at the level of metaphysicalenquiry. Most people are out of their depth, which is why roguesand charlatans can lead them a merry dance."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"We cannot refer to sources or origins the way that journalistsdo.

The same criticism can bemade of all sacred literature.3. A God would make it easier to know Him.And because He hasn’t informed you, He must therefore notexist?

Have you ever thought that God might just besulking?The law states that nobody may assume that a house isunoccupied merely on the grounds that when you knocked onthe door, nobody answered. How dreadful if squatters couldmove in while you were out shopping, or if you visited friendsfor the weekend and came back to find your home had become afast food joint. God has a right to do whatever He wishes. Hecan lock Himself in, or slip out when no one is looking. He mayhave a black car with no lights that he drives after midnight. Tofind no evidence does not mean that there is no evidence. It isfalse to conclude that God doesn’t exist on the grounds that Hedoesn’t behave as you expected Him to.4. Who bestows God status?For logical, analytical purposes, there are two kinds of gods.First, there are the gods that man invents. Second, there are godswhich have independent existence. Now it could be argued thatwhen man invents a god, he is merely attaching his own name orlabel to a divinity that already exists.

But this gathering ofsubsidiary information does not tell us anything at all about thetrue nature of God. It only tells us what other people consider tobe appropriate god-like characteristics.Many spiritual paths speak in terms of the individual soulpassing through several stages of initiation in order, eventually,to achieve the highest possible status. Although this may bedescribed as ‘becoming God’, we should not assume that it is astatus that is conferred like the Queen bestowing a knighthoodor the pope consecrating a bishop. Mystic teaching perceives theprocess as one of spiritual evolution where the ‘self’ is absorbedinto the entity that we refer to as God, or the gods. It might helpif you pondered the difference between polytheism andpantheism. Look them up in an encyclopaedia.5. Why aren’t you more forthright in your answers?I proceed carefully because there are fanatics about. A fanatic issomeone whose emotional conviction outweighs his ability toreason. Ordinarily, the two things ought to achieve a harmoniousbalance, but a fanatic is so overwhelmed that he is capable ofextreme behaviour. If my answers to certain questions are lessfulsome – if I seem to reply cautiously – this is a good indicationthat I am not a fanatic. I’m trying to keep our discussion on aneven keel. If this irritates, please excuse me.6. Why isn't God ‘nice’ and religion ‘cosy’?Sentimentalism and romanticism are lyrical, childhoodyearnings for a past that has gone. They hold back progress.

It trains you to be like dogs who are gratefullyservile to their superiors merely because they have stoppedflogging them! This kind of piety is founded on fear.

Our parents, our society and our world have lostsight of this priceless deposit of truth. So they do nothing tofoster it. Even so, the vast majority of people feel the unease andlack in their soul.

Aperson can be both sincere and misguided – so don’t equate factand conviction, and never judge truth by a man’s fervour. Weare on difficult ground here because truth is absolute, notrelative.

The danger isthat New Age is imitation truth, yet it may stop people searchingfor something more needful. I do not regard religion as a casewhere anything will do.

Should we abandon technological advances?Not necessarily. Technology is the practical application ofknowledge that man has acquired, but there is good technologyand bad technology, which are the scientist's parallels to whitemagic and black magic. No doubt mankind could apply histechnology without endangering life and the environment, butthe basic problem seems to lie in people's motivation. The costsof development work mean that different countries or differentinstitutions will compete for the legal patent to certain medicinesor electronic components. Egoism and altruism still do battle inmen's hearts and all too often the innocent suffer because ofpride, greed and envy on the part of others.2. Are you against science?No more than I'm against oxygen or microwave ovens. Scienceis knowledge about the physical world. Occultism is to do withabstract or spiritual things. It is part of the scientist's job todoubt what he cannot prove. In spite of this, many scientists arevery religious people.3. Is magic beyond the laws of physics?There are forms of energy which do not conform to the laws ofphysics as we know them. Those laws exist. But whoever orwhatever instituted them, also has the power to suspend them.Hence, the scientist does research into the causes of things whilea Magus uses them. Magic is the applied technology of Truth.4. To what do you attribute these forces?Our ancestors lacked the benefit of scientific thought yet theyoffered explanations for things.

But some of their other theories astonish us withtheir complexity, clarity and genius.

Are you evading the point?Not that I'm aware of. You are not obliged to accept my beliefs.I count on your integrity, that's all. When I say that I am gladthat spiritual or supernatural forces exist ... you may stick toyour own theories about the phenomena. But be careful not toinvent explanations which make it impossible to discuss them!For example, if you pretend that it is all due to UFO's, then youcannot prove it, I cannot disprove it, and intelligence becomesincompetent. It's the same with fairies!6. Does Occultism accept the theory of evolution?Occultism is not so dogmatic as to feel threatened by scientifictheory, and I don’t feel called upon either to endorse or rejectanyone’s findings. The only duty that an Occult Master shouldplay is to comment on consequent action. No one is ever goingto blame anyone for believing or not believing, provided healways behaves in an ethical manner. I refer again to the Law ofThelema: ‘Do what thou wilt ...’, with the emphasis on that firstimperative: ‘Do’.It is perhaps a mistake to consider biological evolutionseparate from man’s social evolution and the evolution of hispersonality. These are all on-going and integrated processes thatcontribute ultimately to both personal fulfilment and to theachievement of whatever is understood by the term, the cosmicplan. A man may stop or even reverse his own individualevolution, and social groups may stop or even reverse thedevelopment of a particular society. But unless someoneactually destroys the world - i.e., the ability of this planet to"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"support life - then the steady unfolding of the plan is notinterrupted.7. What do you mean by ‘the Plan’?Human beings have but limited awareness. Our insights into thepossible workings of the divine are severely restricted and we donot try too assiduously to improve them. Nevertheless, some ofour profoundest thinkers hold that there is purpose and meaningto the cosmos. Insofar as we are capable of knowing thesethings, the firmament appeared and life developed in ways thatwere far too orderly and sequential for them simply to have beenthe serendipitous outcome of arbitrary events. Spiritual people –Occultists among them – perceive a pattern. They also believethat the purpose behind this pattern is knowable.All of this could be nothing more than pious, wishfulthinking: an intelligent creature’s need for reassuringexplanation. However, not only does diligent effort lead tomystical insight, but the powers in charge of the cosmos dosometimes vouchsafe the occasional ‘revelation’. Thus, like thecrew of an ocean-going ship, Occultists believe that someonebuilt the vessel, that the vessel was launched on its particularvoyage, that there was a certain destination, and that their ownactions could either thwart the objectives or help to expeditethem. There may be a lot of heated argument about what thosegoals might be, but there is no disagreement at all on the factthat goals exist. In short: the gods have their purpose, but whocan be sure what that purpose might be?8. How far is Man off-track then?Occultism holds that there was an optimum trajectory thatmankind ought to have followed, but he was diverted from it.Three important points follow from this: (1) he is a long wayfrom the target that he should have reached today; (2) he is even"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"further away off the ultimate goals towards which he was meantto strive, and (3) he is better employed at regaining the groundlost under point one, since it would be wasted on point two.It is fairly futile to fling ourselves at goal whose co-ordinatesare unknown and quite unknowable. Of course, there is a certainnostalgic charm to be found in referring to such fanciful thingsas ‘Never-Never Land’ or ‘Shangri-La’. But, apart fromreminding us that an ultimate goal does exist, no great purposeis served. But calling it ‘The Holy Grail’ is no more helpful thancalling it ‘Rainbow’s End’ or ‘Where Bluebirds Fly’.9. How can we regain lost ground?No motion can be considered ‘progress’ unless it transports thesoul in the right direction. One’s first task therefore is accuratelyto determine one’s current position on a reliable map. Let us callthis Point A. We then compare this with the hypotheticalposition that we would have occupied had everything proceededaccording to plan. Let us call this Point B. The only progressthat matters is that which reduces the distance between A and B.Simply trekking to Glastonbury because it feels nice, orbecause there’s a pretty legend which suggests that the HolyGrail once passed through a local Antique Shop .. is ridiculousand futile. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that an activity thatpleases or satisfies must necessarily contribute to the GreatWork. For all we know, the souls of the damned are allowed tosing just like convicts in a chain gang ... do we thereforeconclude that the more verses we get through, the nearer we areto paradise?10. What do you mean by ‘individual’ evolution?When events forge directly ahead, without branching, we couldrefer to that process as ‘evolution’. But veering off track is‘involution’, while actually drifting backwards is ‘devolution’."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Each is designated according to its final ends. If a person is inprocess of unfolding and discovering then he is evolving and heis aiming still for the original goal. If he is involving then he isheading for an inappropriate or invalid goal, and it he isdevolving then he is going back towards his origins andexhibiting characteristics that betray his primordial origins.We should not surrender our birthright for trivial reasons orgive up our heritage to gamble for transitory pleasures. It isnotoriously difficult for any individual to keep his eyes fixed onlofty principles but it is part of a Master’s role to provide thenecessary support and assistance.11. And what happens when Man isn’t ‘evolving’?He risks ‘reverting to type’: brute force rises in the personality,rage dominates the mind, and base animal appetites takeprecedence over other aspects of existence. Little by little we arebrutalised, and it doesn’t make much difference whether thisprocess is inflicted on us, by a heedless society say, or we letourselves go by sheer self-disregard or loss of self-esteem. Theresults are the same: our mind is toppled, our spirit is debased,and we lose our hope.It means that millions of years of evolutionary progress isbeing abandoned and that the finest xenotypes of life are slidingbackwards. Either they are abandoning their own vantage point,or else they are being overwhelmed by some negative tide.12. How does Modern Life affect this?One big change is our increasing separation from the largergroup and the community. Changes in our ideas of the familyhave not helped at all, nor have the growing value of privacy.

One by one,we succumb.To a very great extent we have also abandoned religion andforgotten to replace it with anything that could perform the samefunctions. Where once we strove just to stay alive, now we aretoo impressed by pleasures and we over-indulge ourselves.Before the twentieth century there were no slimming diets. Themajority of the population were half- starved ... and the averageexpectation of life was around twenty-five years! Under thoseharsh conditions, religion was clearly essential. Under modernconditions, it is not quite so clear.13. Has our object of worship changed?Yes indeed. Now we are so impressed by our own technologicalachievements, that we forget that they all occurred within thegiven universe and that Man is not the Supreme Master. Wehave improved our lot, but we have not really changed theworld. Nevertheless, our weak and enfeebled spirit allows ourmind to imagine that we have got it all sorted out. In short: forquite some time already, man has been worshipping himself! Orto put it another way: he has remade God in his own image.14. Where is the harm?Man has put the Cosmic Plan on ‘hold’. He is now in theprocess of destroying his own world. He would do better to tryto work with Nature and not against her. How great the triumphif he helped to realise the plan. This is how we reach a clearstatement of our Occult intentions. We work with natural andsupernatural forces in order to bring about the next stage in theCosmic Plan. To do that properly, we first work on our ‘self’because we wish to become the person we were always meant tobe. We must crown the original self.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"First steps1.

What is this process called?At different times, the work has been called by different names.Once it was known as ‘The Dance Through the Labyrinth’.Later on it was called ‘The Quest of the Holy Grail’. Then at atime of great confusion it got mixed up with the search for ‘ThePhilosopher's Stone’. But what does it matter? The crux is tobecome a unique individual ... and to be that person well!3. What is the crucial factor of the soul?The will and it is seldom pure or healthy. Most folk haveaccepted the will of others as their own, but the soul is not atease. This is why The Law of Thelema states: ‘Do what you willis the whole of the Law’. It is fair enough to repeat it parrotfashion, but there is more to it than you dare imagine. With yourMaster's help you must discover your authentic will as soon aspossible.4. What is my authentic will?It is the will you would have had today if no one had ever triedto run your life.

What is a Master?A Master possesses these credentials: (1) he has the knowledge,(2) he has the gifts to teach, and (3) he has authority fromBeyond. He is not just a widely-read collector of books or amusing personality who entertains beautiful day-dreamers. He isa worker of magic and he utilises powers that he has beenrefining all the years of his life. The world in which he findshimself is by no means as congenial as he would like it to be,and so he strives to make it a better place for all of us.There are other kinds of Magician who are more self-servingand more careless of the general interest, but a Master is amagician of excellence, and he is supported in his work by thespirit world.2.

But it was along time again and the world has moved on since then. In anycase, since her death, very few of her statements have beenshown to be true, whereas quite a few have been shown to beuntrue. To make things even worse, there were quarrels amongher entourage after her death with the result that severalcontradictory readings were put on her words. This greatlyconfused the issues. With respect, the lady did not do muchactually to advance mysticism; in fact, she served to put manypeople off and, because they have a certain reputation, her booksare still read and they still hold people back.

Living Masters resemble thatBuddhist notion of Bodhisattva - a being who could move tohigher planes, but who chooses to stay here and help others.5. In what way are Masters special?Living Masters, i.e., Masters who are still on the hoof, may havepassed through several reincarnations. But then again, they arenot terribly common. Slightly less rare than dinosaurs, in fact.But this is quite enough to meet the current demand! No, we dohide ourselves exactly; we just refuse to court publicity.

Where should I look to find a Master?When you realise you need one, he will certainly be withinreach.

When the light dawns, or thepenny drops, you'll be aware of his after-shave and you will befree to grab your chance or let it float away.7. They say Masters never show themselves?People who say it may well wish they were right. But they arewrong. As a Master myself, I hardly ever wear my cloak ofinvisibility. I meet people all the time but they do not recogniseme. If it seems right, I introduce myself. If that was a goodguess, their eyes shine like circus lights. But if was a bad guess,they suddenly remember that they have several trains to catch ordash off to attend to some gas-tap that they left turned on.

But if you want Truth thenapproach the door that opens on the Beyond.10. Why doesn't a real Master cash-in?Because ancient lore forbids a Master to seek fees for his help.He trusts a man to give what he can. If you are poor, he gets buta smile and a hug. If you can afford it, give him some cash orsome food. He offers something beyond price but just like you,he needs the wherewithal to live.11. Do students have a special duty?You'd think so, wouldn't you? But they let it slip their mind. Inthe past, a student would have left everything to go and live withthe Master. He would have been his apprentice. This still appliesif one who wishes to consign oneself to the Gods or the Beyond.But plain members of the flock gave the Master a chicken, a loafof bread, or a day's work in his garden. These days you do whatyou can. At your own discretion. Just to make it quite clear:Truth may not be bought and sold.12. Are there other Masters, besides Amado?Common sense says there must be. One man, even with giftslike mine, couldn't teach the whole world! But Masters aren'tany too thick on the ground. No need, you see: there are not allthat many Seekers either. If there were a sudden flood ofpilgrims, there would be a parallel increase in the number ofMasters. I can tell you: each would dearly love to have anapprentice!13. How do the Masters relate to one another?With fraternal respect. They do meet, but not frequently. I havethe honour of being regarded as their Elder because of my being:the son of Aleister Crowley and his hand-trained apprentice; the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"zenith of a line of reincarnation; able to use a wide range ofpowers; endorsed by authority; greatly feared by Evil; used tomanifest the Beyond.14. If this sounds rubbish, should I withdraw?I don't see why. No one has asked you to believe any of it yet.That is what the Brotherhood of Masters thinks. Since you arenot a Master, you don't have a thing to worry about. Only onequestion counts: can I do the job for you?15. How can I tell if a Master is right for me?Go by instinct or feel. If he is the right one, he'll know it betterthan you. You might just as well put the ball in his court as soonas you feel the ‘twinge’. Leave it to him then. He's not going toaccept you unless he is sure it's the right thing to do. If yousense a Master's power or magnetism then think: how manychaps like him can you expect to meet in life? Make him workfor his breakfast by popping the question.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Style of teaching1. Does a Master stick to a syllabus?No. Students don't always study the same things. Each of you isa unique individual, and you follow your own particular path.Your steps may often cross those of your fellows. You may evenwalk parts of the way together. But at each and every cross-road,you may change direction and separate. This is why I do not likeit when students ‘compare notes’.2. Is there a core of fact common to all?Yes. This is why students can meet in groups and receivelessons together, listen to cassettes, or discuss topics taken froma book. When a Master visits, he gives general talks but alsooffers the opportunity for private chats. Group leaders try tosustain this individual touch by giving help when you need it. Inany case, all important points will be repeated many times, ifonly to make sure that you have taken them in.3. Does a Master teach in an academic style?He uses any style that seems appropriate. He can be formal orcasual, correct or jocular. He will also try to shock you, shakeyou, or make you jump out of your shoes. He wants to crackyour complacency and wreck your assumptions. He will playboth clown and Caligula, according to your needs. If you reactbadly to criticism, he will probably pull your leg! If yourcourage goes, he will patch it up. If you need a breather, he willmake you pause. He'll do all in his power to ensure that youclimb higher. Rather like the medieval master of a craft guildwho takes on an apprentice, he undertakes to see things through."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"4. Can I be sure that he will do the job?He would not accept you as his student unless he felt reasonablyconfident about being able to guarantee the outcome. A greatdeal depends on you and on your willingness to co-operate, andthis is why he requires you to promise that you will obey hisinstructions. He will also weigh the chances of you and heachieving the necessary ‘harmonisation of spirit’ – or magicalcomplicity – in order to forge the necessary team spirit. But byand large, if he takes you on then it is because he is more or lesssure of ultimate success.5. What is the guiding principle?Masters vary too, but all of them wish to lead you toward thediscovery of your original self. They then assist you to transformyourself into that original self. The final step is to learn ‘self-mastery’. The process is far less complex than it sounds. Takenas a whole it is called ‘self-fulfilment’.6. It sounds like a course of psychotherapy?And up to a point, it is! It is also cheaper and quicker. But anypsychology a Master uses will be unorthodox because it comesfrom a framework of Occultism and magic. But what was it thattriggered your question? Are you surprised to learn that amodern science uses ancient techniques also found in magic? Ohdon't be so naive. In the Stone Age, men drilled holes in sickpeople's skulls. We call it trepanning and we still do it to relievepressure on the brain. They did it to release evil spirits. But asRomeo said: what does it matter what you call it as long as itdoes you good?7. Do we learn practical magic and rituals?Not as much as you'd wish. We don't let kiddies play withnuclear bombs either! If Magic and Ritual are your main aimsthen you'll be disappointed. You are not ready for it yet. I would"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"not let a sick person have a key to the medicine cupboard either.I discourage you from doing things you can't handle. A Mastergives what you need, not always what you want. There isusually a big difference.8. But the whole object is to practice magic?It might be your object, but it is not the be-all and end-all of aMagus. Magic has its reasons. There are times when it is right toinvoke your powers but there are times when to do so would bedangerous. Why worry about things that don't concern you? TheMaster trains you and gets you ready. When the time is ripe, hewill raise the subject. Then there'll be no limit on how high yougo or how far. The only obstacle will be your will and yourcommitment.9. Is it enough to teach truth verbally?As you put the question, the answer is yes. My methods do seemto work. No offence, but since you haven't tasted them, it's a bitearly to criticise. It is not feasible to write a guide to magicwhich would be equally useful to all students. Each individualhas particular needs. Yes, men have a lot if common, which iswhy we teach General Principles in the big classroom. But youneed tutorials or private lessons tailored to personal needs. Onemust give personal contact.10. Is Truth accessible to everyone?If it is Truth then it ought to be! You notice that I do not justaccept students with university degrees. I insist on open minds,clear thinking and a modicum of common sense. I've nointention of making sheep and shepherds, or dumb peasantsruled by a priest class. Knowledge is for all, not an elite."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"11. Shall I like what you teach?Do please forgive me, but that kind of question is irrelevant. Interms of law, yes, you are free to choose anything according toyour own, personal criteria. But in terms of the eternal truth,such a choice is not a matter of individual taste. God, theBeyond, and the Path ... these are matters which will not bechanged by anything you may do or say.12. Why aren't you nicer to customers?I don't have customers. Since I have nothing to sell, it followsthat there is nothing that you could buy. If you see everything ona commercial basis then you demonstrate how unready youreally are. If you are really as cynical as all that, I could notguarantee success and so I would not take you on.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Practicalities1. Are there fees or subscriptions?No. Neither is there any written contract, in fine print, whichobliges you to give me a cut of your income! As I haveexplained elsewhere, a genuine Master does not sell the Truth.2. Does any money change hands?Good heavens! You really are suspicious, aren't you? Let me putit this way: you might write to me in Tibet. But if you want areply, I need: stationery, a stamp, the strength to hold a pen, agood meal now and then, warmth and, last but not least - shelterfrom the Yeti. Being a Master is a full-time job. Students shouldthink about that and offer some contribution. A spiritual familyhas the duty to support its patriarch. Since I am still in thisworld, and not the next, I do have needs that must be met.3. Are there fixed levels of ‘donations’?No. It is left to you whether to give or not. It is also up to you tochoose what sum to give. I shall not abandon you if you arestingy. I shall not regard you as my blue-eyed boy if you aregenerous. Just keep your gifts regular so that I can make plansfor visits and live efficiently.4. Will a Master visit me or my group?As often as he can, if you invite him and if you help withexpenses. Sadly, his ‘Magic Carpet’ is frayed and the elasticband needs to be rewound. His bed of nails is rusty too and he istoo old to sleep in cowsheds or ditches. Students know wheretheir Master is when they need help, but they tend to forgetabout him when all is going well. Yet in the interim, he mustlive! Cosmic law says: a Master is worth his keep."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"5. Do I have to buy any of his ‘products’?The only things he ‘produces’ are books and cassettes. He hastoyed with the idea of video too. These things are teaching aidsdesigned because he lives far away, and you need help on yourQuest. But you can do without them. They are not veryimportant except for helping individuals and groups to feel intouch, and to keep abreast of things. They are available, if youwant to buy them. But you can manage without them.6. How much do these study aids cost?As you might expect, they vary. The cost is worked out by aformula that takes into account the following items:- cost oftechnical equipment; price of raw materials; man-hours spent onproduct; the cost of postage; the potential ‘sales’ in one year. Ifyou ask an actuary, as we did, this is an honest way ofconducting our affairs. There is no mark-up for profit.7. Is their use restricted?Fresh copies are made from the originals to meet orders. Youare forbidden to make further copies yourself, and you may notloan them out without permission. You must recognise that inmost cases, students do not buy one copy each, but one copy pergroup! Clearly, I am no threat to the music industry and myrecordings will not feature in the charts. In fact, our pricescompare quite well with similar products on the market, e.g.,Talking Books, language courses, correspondence courses andso on. But there is no rip off, and you are not obliged to buy.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Students1. What are students obliged to do then?Clearly, in order for a Master to be able to carry out hisfunctions on behalf of the student, that student must agree to docertain things. If financial recompense were on offer should thelawn mower fail to cut your lawn, you could not claim thatmoney simply by keeping the lawn mower in its box or nevertaking it out of the garden shed! Similarly, the success of themaster-student relationship depends on each of the partiesfulfilling his side of the agreement. A mystical contract existsbetween them and they agree to be bound by its terms.The two most important clauses are (a) that the Masterundertakes to guide the Student to the summit of the SacredMountain, i.e., to lead him to full perception of the truth, whileat the same time, (b), the Student promises to obey the Masterand to do his best to care for him in return. This does not meanthat he becomes the master’s slave, but insofar as the Masterwill probably neglect his own interests and welfare in order tofurther his student’s interests and welfare, then the student ishonour-bound to take a close, personal interest in the master’swelfare and to co-operate with, not resist, his teaching. Thisrelationship is sometimes likened to their becoming ‘father andson’.2. I don't like being told what to do.Don't be a child. If you had to dismantle a bomb, or fly anaeroplane, or deliver someone's baby ... you'd be very glad ofsome training and some help. When people pretend not to takekindly to guidance, they mean that they had a bad time duringadolescence, they did not like school, or that they hate any kindof authority. This can nearly always be translated as: ‘I don'tknow what to do. I do not trust myself. So I'm not going to trust"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"anybody else.’ The people who say that usually end up in thelocal psychiatric hospital. But it isn't a pity to decide your owndestiny when you can't even stop yourself sweating?3. Shouldn’t each man be his own Master?Thank you for reminding me of yet another corny cliché. I'veheard them all before. But whereas you might be impressed bysuch parrot-like profundities, I would not bother to argue withslogans that I could not understand. Occultism would like you tore-become an original. So you see: I agree with your sentimentsbut I disagree with your practical plans ... if you have any.4. Do students change their minds?Indeed they do. But then, they are always quite free to do so. Ido not rule them with an iron fist. One hears of sects wherequitters are threatened and terrorised. But if a student even hintsthat he might wish to think about his position, I suspend allcontact until he has reached a decision.5. Why do they change their minds?The reasons appear to be many and varied but they all boil downto the same thing: something else is competing for their time andinterest. Often this is a member of the opposite sex. While malescan be sexually jealous for their partners, women tend to resentanyone else who has an influence over theirs.6. Are you against marriage?Good heavens, no! I am all for it. When I have a student who isalone, I do my best to introduce him or her to likely partners.Those students who are married seem to be much happier andfar more stable."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"7. Do you use magic for your students?If I did so openly, or if I promised to do so, then I would neverbe certain of someone's motives for asking to become a student.All I can say is that I promise to do all in my power to help astudent find true happiness.8. Do students ask you for help?It is very strange, but no. Oh I have students who insist onbending my ear with their troubles whenever they meet me. Ihave others who try herbs, acupuncture and every kind ofalternative medicine to heal their ills. But very few actually askme to use magic. To tell you the truth, I think they forget aboutthat aspect of my job.9. Do you do things against their will?No. But I may do things without their knowing. On the whole, atrue magician does not like to attract public attention. He is notin show business and he would not want to be pestered. Again,most students are quite content to leave things to me and I dousually help them to sort out their lives.10. Do you rely on students?Since I am a Teacher, then students are my reason for being.This is what I am here for. As far as I am honestly aware, I haveno other ambitions. Anything else that I may do is either anirrelevant detail, or else one more way of reaching the right ears.I rely on students making progress and becoming magiciansthemselves because then, being family, we can all make a largecontribution to a common pool of shared energy. With thatenergy, we can achieve still greater good.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Fate1. Do you believe in Destiny?Yes, but not in predestination. I don't think that everything is allplanned beforehand, as if God were a playwright and we werejust characters with no freedom to make changes. But I do thinkwe possess talents, qualities and characteristics which make onecourse through life much more satisfactory than another.2. Then we are free to choose?Yes, but only within certain limits. Since you were born a man,you are not allowed to be a goose. But if you were born to be awriter, you will not feel happy being an assistant in a bookshop.Moreover, as you go through life you will come forks, cross-roads or the equivalent of roundabouts. It may not always seemclear which of the roads to choose - but if you choose any butthe right one, you will be less fulfilled or even totally frustrated.3. Is it possible to be more fortunate?Yes, but you must always remember that there is a price to pay,for nothing is given for nothing. But in wider terms, one canimprove one's general standard of good fortune simply bybanishing all the forces that might repel positive energies orneutralise the astral guardians you have won. Remember, it ispossible to have ‘bad luck’ just because one has attractednegative energy.4. Do you believe in The Day of Doom?Not in the sense that a frustrated God will abandon the wholeplan of creation and wreck what He has wrought, no! But if onestands far enough back, it becomes possible to see a pattern inthe history of the world which strongly suggests a slow declinetowards what one supposes must be an ‘end’. But I also believe"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"that it is possible for us, the human species, to forestall that endby combining our energies and unifying our disparate ‘will’. Itherefore see a slight grammatical error in the famous Law ofThelema. When it says ‘Do what THOU wilt’, it ought really toread: ‘Do what YOU will’ in the plural.5. Do you have a pessimistic view of mankind?One is tempted. And I would be less than honest if I didn't saythat I sometimes get dispirited. But I fight this kind of reflex byturning to humour. I think that pure, honest laughter is a greatthing for cleansing the soul ... and even for exorcising theoccasional bit of evil that hovers round certain people. But haveyou noticed how very sensitive some people are to fun? Theytake themselves so seriously that one must not even smile intheir presence. They would prefer your eyes to light up withworship - or if not worship, then terror.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Sense of humour1. You seem to like ‘absurd’ humour.This is a good reason for this. The disordered mind is alsoabsurd, and I find that the one can help to ‘untangle’ the other orto shake out the emotional ‘knots’. If you had been alert andvery perceptive, you might have noticed that I also like laughingat myself or even making jokes about myself. Since I do workwith people who have sometimes ‘gone under’, I try toadminister the occasional self-massage. I would never wish tobecome a dull sanctimonious bore. There is little I can do ifpeople are offended by either humour or truth. Should I stoptelling jokes and start lying instead?2. Instead of wit, why not explain?Aleister Crowley once described the toilets in his Cairo hotel aspithy and witty. He had a slight lisp. Exhaustive explanationsare not to everyone's liking. Most of them want to know what is,and not how it came about. This book is meant to be more of ahelpful commentary on points that other would-be studentsfound difficult. I am not giving lessons but the taste of things sothat you can decide if you want to take it further. At yourpresent state of knowledge, I could say too much. You mightwelcome that, but you'd get Occult stomach-ache or magicaldiarrhoea. In addition, the book must be reasonably brief or itwould be too costly to produce. Pithy and witty will do.3. Is a sense of humour important?It's crucial! Why wear the stern outlook of the Puritans? We donot meditate on hell-fire or the wrath of God. We do not grovelto avoid any debts that are due. We live life. We love life. Wethink we are Gods' handiwork and not laboratory animals beingused to prove which religion is correct."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"4. How does humour help?Mutual joy can unite people. Take the power of love as anexample, and compare it with the brittle gaiety of people at afairground who are afraid when the lights go out. A Magus canlive with laughter. It marks off man from every other animal.‘Beware the man who laughs not in his belly,’ says a Japaneseproverb. The Pope doesn't. Few spiritual leaders do. But isn't itfascinating that Demons also hate laughter? They have evenbeen exorcised by jokes.5. But shouldn't Occultism be reverent?It is, but in its own way. Do we have to whisper, walk ontiptoes, cover our heads, and wear Sunday clothes? Is our Godasleep and must we tread carefully in order not to waken Him?May we not stand at our lover's bedside and gaze in wonder athis or her beauty? Why not hold the hand of a dying man, ortake a new-born babe into your arms? Maybe you should changeyour opinions on reverence.6. Isn’t the holy life one of self-denial?So says the Christian church. I believe it is a skein of holinessplaited with happiness. If you are unable to handle the two, thenby all means join a religion which teaches you to waste your lifein getting ready to die! There is a touch of divinity in our beingwhich allows us to laugh at the sheer absurdity of it all. There's amystery that is worth thinking about! When you fathom thatsecret, you'll be ready to climb.7. What is the magical life?It is a life that is lived in harmony with Nature, one that isdisciplined rather than casual, and informed by the light of truthrather than simple whim or impulse. It is not overly solemn orpo-faced, yet both serious and full of humour. It is gracefulwithout licking boots and full of joy in place of stress. The"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"person who lives ‘the Magical Life’ strives to realise his originalself, and to install his true will. He is neither lonely nor alonebecause he is lives as one soul in relationship with a group orcommunity of other souls. He identifies ‘self’ as being anintegral part of the larger, organic whole and through thisexpanded mutuality, he becomes aware of the different levels ofbeing. He moves the focus of his attention and tries to assumehis proper position on the nexus of a network of spiritualrelationships that mesh with both his own world and with thebeyond.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Being an Occultist1. Do we try to get closer to God?No need! When the walls are down, the supernatural comescloser to you. You are always aware of a divine essence. Youcan sense God in all types of life and people. Life for you is ajourney that leads toward home. You avoid any situation whichmight slow you down. Led by your conscience, you strive not toharm other beings, but rather to help them.2. Does an Occultist follow a special diet?Only if he's diabetic or has some other medical reason to do so.We have no special fads, and we don't rule our lives by irrationalsentiment. We are not vegetarian, for instance. But if you are, Iam not going to stop you unless your health is affected. I am notso arrogant as to turn my back on all scientific discovery; but Ihold that man is something more than a thinking brain.Whatever your current beliefs may be, you must bow to theBeyond, if it makes itself manifest.3. Is there any ‘fasting’ or ‘abstinence’?Much less that you might imagine. Before a grand ritual, theparticipants may adhere to a reduced diet or fast. If one is usingmagic to bring about changes in oneself, a person may abstainfrom sexual thoughts. But at other times, he may add things tohis diet - for instance, the use of sun-water for somebody who isrun-down and lacking in vitality.4. Should we withdraw from the world?What makes you ask? Are they giving away holidays on theMoon again? To be frank: you cannot withdraw from the world.You can only remove yourself from human contact. If youchoose to do that you will suffer the same effects as many of the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"old Hermits (such as Saint Antony) or prisoners who have beenheld in solitary confinement. You will go wrong in the head!5. Why would that happen?The human species is a ‘herd animal’ and it does not exist in anyreal sense unless it is a social entity. If we cut it off from contactwith other human beings, then it starts quite quickly todegenerate. This has been shown to be true in such cases as:prisoners, torture victims, inmates of lunatic asylums, shipwrecksurvivors and neglected old-folk. If you truly welcome the ideaof living like Prospero in ‘The Tempest’, by Shakespeare, thenyou are not quite right in the head.6. But what if I want to ‘get away from it all’?Then you abandon your fellows, you refuse to stay and helpthem, and when you come back - they will shun you. You maynot escape your duty toward Nature. Will you may run back ifyou are sick or if a great wind strikes? You must help to repairhuman society. A holiday is all right but run away and you'll‘devolve’ into a primitive beast again.7. What about Communes?An occult commune is simply a household, like any other, butinstead of being based on the accident of biological birth (i.e.,blood ties), it is built on informed choice and spiritual aims.Each commune is self-governing and owes no loyalty to anyexternal, larger body. Neither it is a cult since the membersthemselves decide which spiritual tenets apply and how far theywish to follow them.The economic advantages of a commune are huge, but thespiritual and magical benefits are even greater. If a communehappens to shelter an occult Master (and this is not a sine quanon), then it is likely to become a powerhouse and a generatorthat can supply magical energy for several undertakings."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"A commune permits ordinary sufficiently to withdraw fromthe distractions of everyday living without becoming religiousrecluses. It is modelled rather on a natural way of life that ourown ancestors lived in more spiritual times before societybecame quite so materialistic and urbanised. We do not try tocut ourselves off from harsh reality but merely to protect oursouls, to seek spiritual respite and to find fulfilment.8. Does an Occultist have a daily routine?We are not monks or nuns, and we do not need to have dailyreminders of our guilt and worthlessness. If the Master gives usadvice, we follow it. But we have no Angelus or any dailyprayers. We live our religion and know our part in the Plan.9. What about regular rituals?There are none that concern a student. To make ritualsobligatory would result in the ‘Our Father’ phenomenon. You'drattle them off like a high-speed train. I'm amazed by theslickness of priest's tongues. When an Occultist performs hisritual acts and recites the formulae, he does so with solemndeliberation. One must not treat them like school recitations orhistoric dates. The words and gestures are not enough. It needsour spirits. There's no benefit, only risk, in doing things by rote.Magic must not be as casual as brushing your teeth.10. What do you say about meditation?I consider it exceedingly dangerous. Far from inducing asupreme state of mind by means of alpha rhythms, as someexponents claim, it can just as readily produce destructiverhythms and encourage depression or suicide. I don't want to seeOccultists adopting the Lotus posture, or for that matter theKiss-Me-Quick position. If you want to indulge your taste for abit of eastern spice, I shall want to know why. No blank faces!Real meditation is a tool ... and not an act of piety itself."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"11. Do Magicians take drugs?No. A Magician does not take drugs, except those that areprescribed by a doctor. If I wanted to make money or just bepopular, I would tell people what they wanted to hear. I wouldn'tmake such unpopular statements unless I were sincere.12. What have you got against drugs?My view has nothing whatever to do with the laws of anycountry. Neither do I wish to be a kill-joy. But drugs (andalcohol) tend to weaken a person's will. As you know, will is ofparamount importance in magic. Why should I teach weakpeople? I want to be sure that when they speak to me it is theirsoul talking and not the effect of drugs.13. Does an Occultist give everything up?You are thinking of monks who take vows of chastity,obedience and poverty. Well, I'm sorry, but that does not applyto us. If you want a path with overtones of masochism, go tochurch. I ask you to abandon only the things that impede yourprogress. But the same divine law, given by the three worldreligions, which states that we should never knowingly causeharm to others, also states that a man should never willingly doharm to himself.14. Then there is no sacrifice involved?A Master will ask you to give up anything that is harmful. Ifsuch things were ‘obvious’ - like banging your head against abrick wall, you'd be eager to obey him. But if these things aretoo subtle, you'll be reluctant to conform. Which is why youpromise to obey. If it is necessary, a Master will order you to doso. There'd be no point in striving for your soul, if you werequietly strangling it."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"15. Is the Occult life different?Yes, mostly in the field of self-control and the development ofone's ‘will’. You should not over-indulge yourself in any way.Your body is made of meat, and this meat has its own needs andappetites. You must never let that ‘meat’ rule you like a slave.Your own will must be the Master of your destiny. If you reflecton this matter: a life passed in the pursuit of pleasure is a lifewasted on stuffing one's appetites.16. Can I rely on the Master to guide me?To guide you, yes; but accept responsibility for you, no! EachOccultist must strive to become master of his own Self and exerttotal control of his energy flows. Only then will he be able tofocus power where he wishes. If he insists of remaining a child,then so be it. One must leave him in the play-school. But Icannot emphasise enough that we do not seek to fight ourNature. First we enthrone it, then we protect it, and then wecrown it with a pure and shining Will.17. What is the ultimate aim of a student?The goals change throughout one's life. As a child you wantsweeties, but when you are old enough to buy sweets, you wantsex. When you reach the age where sex is obtainable, you wanta racing car. If you get your racing car, you'll be too old to driveit. So you buy sweeties for your grandchildren. But underlyingall these silly aims there is one grand desire. You want to fulfilyour own destiny. To do this though, you must first find and re-install your Original Self. Which is why a student's immediategoal is to ‘become perfect’, i.e., become the real you. Until thenit is useless to discuss the goals which might, or might notfollow."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"18. Does perception deepen?Do we improve? Certainly! Even if you put in no effort, you willgain a lot just by being one Occultist among others. But youractual progress depends on your will. There is no limit apartfrom the one you impose. Self-mastery, Crowning the Will,Opening the Eyes all these expressions are attempts to describethe same phenomenon. Aleister Crowley put it very neatly: ‘Youpossess the power to obtain greater power!’ Since this is so, startthe process by shedding fear and sadness.19. Is Occultism a form of therapy?If you examined the type of people who profess to be Occultists,you would think not. But yes, in actual fact, Occultism iscertainly therapeutic - in that it seeks to improve the state ofbeing in all its members. Indeed, no one may go on to higherstudies unless he has achieved an optimum level of well-being.How silly and irresponsible to teach magic to a psychopath!20. Do Occultists believe in ‘sin’?No. But Evil does exist and people can be wicked. There is noneed to make a list of sins and appropriate punishments.

If you expose yourself to toomuch Evil then you'll suffer the effects until you are cleansed.Nobody wants to hurt you; you have suffered enough already.But they need to guard themselves and others from possiblecontagion. For that reason, you are either excluded, like a leper,or you ask for ‘The Cleaning’.21. What is a Cleaning?A ceremony at which a Magus attempts to clear out the rubbishin your body and soul.

Are there different degrees of studentship?Do you mean like full-time, part-time and day-release? You areconfusing me with a technical college or a college of furthereducation. All other factors have to be ignored, I'm afraid. Eitherone becomes a student or else one doesn't.23. But private circumstances must count?Yes, but they count afterwards, not before. And they do notcount for everything, but only for the rate or intensity oflearning. All this kind of thing is mere detail and there are waysthat we can take care of it. You should not even think aboutpossible problems - only about whether you feel a call and ifyou should answer.24. To what extent will it occupy my time?As much as you decide that it deserves. Far from over-loadingyou with lessons and materials, I try always to follow your ownexpression of needs. You ask questions and I respond. You tellme the direction that interests you, and I react to your words. I'mnot saying that I let myself be dominated by your will - but I‘feed’ you according to the needs that you evince.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Rituals1. What is ritual?They are formal operations, usually requiring the presence ofseveral people. They achieve several ends:- they provide visible lessons on abstract points- they reinforce the strength of positive emotions- they banish fear and renew one's hope- they remind us all of our mutual commitments- they celebrate publicly our shared beliefs- they draw down blessings and protection- they lend supernatural force to our will.2. Do magic rituals work?If not, why would we go on doing them? They work even whenthey are not well done! They ought to achieve the first fiveresults listed above. As for the other two, one needs a mystickey that is provided either a Master's presence or by a written‘Let’ by which he authorises a single enactment of a ritual at acertain time and place. No ritual will achieve its ends unlessthose ends are worthy. If you try to pull the wool over a Master'seyes or cheat the Beyond, you will be unable to cope with theoutcome, which may be fatal.3. How much of ritual is psychological?Since the flourishing of new sciences, such as psychology, wehave many possible explanations at our fingertips about the waythe human mind works. But why it works is different from howdoes it works. Rituals do have a psychological aspect, if onlybecause the participants often have brains. Since there is nophysical reason why magic ritual should work, we have to use"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"the term supernatural too. In other words, we don't have muchchoice but to believe in a force superior to man.4. Can one do magic rituals by oneself?No! Or to be precise, what you did would not really be a ritual.There is a wide range of magic you can perform alone. Butbefore a Master teaches you any of this, he has to be sure thatyou are ‘safe’, i.e., that you are unlikely to panic, but able tostay calm and controlled. There are also many acts of lessermagic which might be shared with a non-Occultist: e.g., helpingsomeone who is sick. In ‘Excalibur’, a set of recorded tapesdesigned for men with sex problems, there are some magicrecipes. Even these are not rituals as such. They are minor,ceremonial acts.5. Why can't I perform my own rituals?For the very same reason that you cannot play Beethoven's 9thon a mouth-organ, or hold a boxing match against yourself. Thedeed calls for concerted effort from several people at the sametime. It takes two to make love. It takes twenty-two to playfootball. A ritual by definition, is a ‘communal act’. Noindividual is a community, even if he has head-lice.6. Can I practice?Of course, each instrumentalist in an orchestra will work on hisown skills, and every sportsman does some training. By thesame token, every student of magic may practice for higherthings. But I do sometimes wonder why every beginner wants tosummon up demons or strike his neighbour's house withthunder? In terms of magic, he is just a school-boy whom oneforbids to touch the plutonium."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"7. You don't talk about rituals in your books.Volume 7 of ‘Liber Lucis’, printed in the early seventies, gave afull set of rituals for Occult groups. I also gave The AmethystineCycle, Waecce, Lytlum and the Wyrm Tyht which were solotraining techniques. Many others are available to student groups.These are not mentioned in the books of mine that you may havefound in general bookshops, but then they are not intended forthe casual general reader.8. Don't you trust students?They are extremely hasty. If they were studying medicine, they'dwhip out every one's appendix. If they were preparing to workon ships, they'd block the Panama canal. When it comes tomagic, no one can restrain himself. They saw Mickey Mouse asthe Sorceror’s Apprentice in the film Fantasia and they can’twait to have a go.

Which iswhy so many stutter when they go to France.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Status1. Can a student rise to a higher grade?There are cheats and frauds in the market-place. One type triesto put zip into an auction by offering a few stupendous bargains.These are always bought by stooges in the crowd. TrueOccultists have much the same contempt for ranks, grades,degrees and titles which would turn Pooh-Bah (The Lord HighEverything Else) green with envy. These things are more lucid isyou ask what purpose they serve. There are no nasty distinctionsin Occultism.2. Are these distinctions evil then?They are based on the hierarchy that one finds in an army, or inthe Roman Catholic church. The use of such ranks means adistribution of power and authority - things which belong to alland not a special few. Once you carve up power, you also createa monopoly in the market. A few have something to sell and themajority need to buy. That is servility. Some Occult orders arequite well-off, in spite of their declared devotion to spiritualityand truth.3. How is a seeker's progress marked?There are only three divisions:- Students, or learners- Initiates, or fully skilled practitioners- Masters, or teachers.No one has special privileges or prestige. Other titles have to dowith jobs, e.g., Healer, Spirit Caller, Diviner or Seer. Onespends a long time in developing the appropriate skills. Beforeanyone can claim a certain right or privilege, this must beconferred on him in front of his home community. They must"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"witness his change of status and acknowledge it. If this wereomitted, there would be no support from The Beyond. Whenmagic is used to work a change, folk have to be told, or elsethere'd be confusion. It is the bond between this world, here andnow and that world, there and then, which establishes thetransfer of new knowledge and additional powers.4. Do different grades mean secrets and power?Not in any disagreeable manner. Most doctors are betterqualified than nurses, and most nurses are more qualified thanWard Assistants, etc. If I were you, I would not worry aboutthat. When you're nothing, your fantasies are vivid; but once youstart climbing the Mountain, your hopes and ambitions will belowered. Should you ever become an Initiate, you may evenwant to refuse the powers that are your due.5. How can I become an Initiate?By showing the proper merit. You must make progress in everyaspect of your studies: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual andmagical. Your level of commitment must be high. You shouldhave no wrong motive for wanting to be an Initiate, but seekmerely the licence to use your powers for the help of others.Therefore, you should have attracted the notice both of spiritsand your Master.6. How is an Initiate installed?At a ritual. You can ask for the ritual to be held if you havefound Three Candles. These are male candidates that you havenursed to the point that they want to be students of the Master,without having met him. You have given them courage,confidence and instruction. You must also be certain that theMaster will accept them! This shows the depth of yourunderstanding. How sad it would be if the Master refused to goon with the ritual, or rejected one of your Candles. An Initiate isa qualified Occultist, and the Ritual is his final examination."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"7. Can an Initiate lose his status?Celtic and Teutonic myths provide examples of this. Evil canenter into a person. He can abuse his power. He may fail hisduties. There are many reasons why an individual can fall fromfavour and lose his powers, of course. Imagine how awful itwould be if ex-students set themselves up as Masters! Nowwe're not the Mafia. Our authority doesn't come from tyranny.8. Can I be certain of getting there?If you have kept your promise to obey your Master and yourMaster is genuine, then it is guaranteed that you'll get there.There are many metaphors to describe this success: reachingJerusalem, finding Xanadu, or getting to the top of the SacredMountain. Between now and then, don't forget to jettison allproblems and fears, especially those you have possibly grownquite fond of!9. Will long service make me an Initiate then?No more than someone learning to drive who has had a hundredlessons and is still refused a licence. The question is not abouteffort, but appropriate effort and flair. This is why you ought tobe led by a Master. Your obedience should lead to Initiation inthe end, but how long that takes will vary from man to man.10. Can you give an estimate?That's difficult. But let us say: the same time it would take foryou to recognise and install your true self. But this is justanother way of saying that it depends on you and your level ofpersonal commitment.11. Is a Master needed to become an Initiate?Well, you wouldn't expect a Lorry Driver to do it, would you?Only a Master can summon the Beyond and conjure them torecognise you. Only a Master can endow you with new powers."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Only a Master can present you to the community and ask themto witness your new status. Only a Master can waive the matterof three candles and initiate you by his own mandate. But no onehas become a student one day, and been initiated the next. Thetime lapse seems to vary between four and fourteen years, with anorm at nine years. (N.B. If he deems it appropriate, a Mastermay initiate someone and withhold higher powers.)12. In some groups you climb quickly.That's because they have so many ranks that everyone can havetwo or three per year. It ought to put you on your guard andmake you suspicious. If there is also a sliding tariff of fees orother hidden payments, then you might well wonder why. Itdoes seem to be is a handy way of milking the credulous forevery penny they've got. But what possible value could there beas regards ‘the Gods’ or ‘that world, there and then’?4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Occult Orders1. What are Occult orders and secret societies?Both are shy about their doings and their members. Since mostthings are legal today, one wonders what they are getting up to.Why do they hide themselves in mazes of cuckoo-spit at suchtimes of tolerance? It brings to mind the dubious shenannigansof certain shadowy figures in the criminal underworld, asillustrated in Hollywood gangster films. Most orders, but not all,say they have Occult goals. Most societies are pursuing moreearthly goals of a political type. Now any normal group ofpeople ought to share goals and beliefs in common, and harboura sense of fellowship. As if they were Chinese Triads or theNew York Mafia, many Orders are keen to wipe out opposition.2. Do Orders have occult value?According to them, yes. According to me, no. They are so weak,shallow and unreasonable. Often they are dedicated to a singlecause and have about as much chance of a mystic meeting withGod as I have of marrying Princess Margaret (an old flame ofmine). This is an absurd proposition for genuine seekers whoneed sincere help in finding their Path.3. What about secret societies?These are often founded by schoolboys, to add colour to aboring life. Grown-up versions were frequently set up for thesame reason. They are little more than social clubs. A few ofthem tried to copy the Freemasons' style. The nicest thing onecan say is that either they failed - or they are hidden in theFreemasons' back-pocket."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"4. Do I need a Master to enter an Occult order?It's like asking if you must be a Conservative in order to buy the‘Daily Telegraph’. It rather depends on what you are going touse the ‘Daily Telegraph’ for, wouldn't you say? Most OccultOrders like to have exclusive influence over you. They take itamiss when Masters contradict them. Also there's the fact that insome Orders you sign a document, which gives them apercentage of your gross income for life. I'm sorry but it remindsme of gangsters living in luxury - at your expense!5. How many orders are there?Not as many as you probably imagine. I discount the weird ones,formed by neurotic souls in their own bed-sitting rooms. Idiscount too the Orders started by immature youth as acts ofsocial defiance. They have very grand titles and are just anextension of role-playing games. They are part of a fantasy. Themore serious orders are often of 18th or 19th Century origin.Peel away their Imperialistic overtones and there isn't a lot left.Many of them sank when their founders died.6. Why do orders love exotic atmosphere?For the same reason that little boys love ‘Indiana Jones’, andolder men like a strip-tease dance with a snake! It lends meaningto their lives. Now that dancer could teach them that frills andfeathers annex interest even where there was none. In a group,some members will force it to be exotic and mysterious. Youcan often get the flavour from the name that it goes by. Oh, bythe way, many Orders are ‘overseen’ by the Freemasons - sodon't say I didn't warn you.7. Can I stay a member of an Order?If that is what you want then you are not ready to be my student.I agree that some orders are worthy of respect. But it is verydoubtful that they and I will teach the same things. If you had a"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"foot in both camps, you would have frequent conflicts of faith.Ask them the same question. I think they will give you the sametype of answer.8. Why do you debunk others?It took the law quite a long time to get round to banning quackdoctors and phoney remedies. But when it dawned on them thatthese people cost money to the health system - they clampeddown with a great show of piety. The government has notpassed any laws yet as regards religion. For them, this is adelicate area. But the Cosmic Law says that no man may takeadvantage of the credulity or the innocence of others for his ownadvantage. I don't mind people forming groups for free sex, formaking gold, or for making clothes for orphan fairies. I don'tmind deeply sincere people who have honest motives. What Idetest is the ‘Occult Mafia’.9. But you recommend group activities?Yes, because social or group situations are much more natural,whereas solitary study can set up morbid fears and nasty ideas.But there is a big difference between being with friends, andspending your life with cloistered brothers. No one will pressyou to become a Master or an Initiate. You can stay a laymanfor ever, if you prefer. No one can tell you to become a priest.That kind of life-decision can only be made by you and all wecan do is offer neutral counsel and support.10. Must I join an order to see rituals?This is true of most orders. But just as some abbeys welcome thepublic to join their worship, so I invite my students to take partin certain rituals. As with the theatre, most of you like to attendbut few of you would like to be actors. Do you want to join in orjust observe? The decision is yours. In either case, you shouldsee it as an opportunity to explore your own true nature and,possibly, to learn something meaningful about your original self."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"11. Do you belong to an Order?I am the Head of an Order. But I don't expect students to enrolfor membership. As a matter of fact, I stop them from thinkingabout it until they are wiser in the ways of the world. This hasno effect at all, and most of my students believe that they havebeen members for years! You will find that you are totally free.And when you have consummated your goals, you will still befree. Being my student has no connection with joining an order.12. What is the Order you belong to?Well, it isn't so much an Order as a religion, and it's as old asmankind. So, when speaking casually, we call ourselves TheElder Kind, or The Friends of the Beyond. This makes it niceand ambiguous for those who are trying to launch inter-continental curses at us. The name is meant to remind us of theclose links that exist between us, which we try to re-weld by ourmagic.13. Are people allowed to join your Order?Well, we're not going to increase by natural reproduction! Yes,there is a way for people to join us. But as we are not yetthreatened with extinction, would-be members won't find it easyto get in. We don't trap the young and honest, neither do wecourt those who are desperate for help. We accept only thosewho are meant to be members.14. Is there any literature about it?No. None that is available to the public. We don't have anyglossy brochures or colourful leaflets either. If someone wantsto be a member, we see to it that he gets the necessaryinformation at the proper time. If he wants more and earlier he'snot likely to get it.

That is hardly ever now!4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Knowledge1. What is this ‘cosmic law’ you refer to?It was the Ancient Greeks who first conceived the notion of‘primal chaos’ onto which the gods imposed order to create the‘cosmos’. But in so doing, they also brought about a certain‘balance’ between the two states. From elementary physics weknow that merely lifting an object, i.e., raising it against theforce of gravity, transfers kinetic energy to that object and, as aconsequence of having been lifted, it now contains the capacityto fall. So there resides in the very order of the cosmos theforces that would pull it down.There are similar parallels in almost every aspect ofphysical, mental, emotional and spiritual reality. Thus, to givebut a few examples of this principle at work: (a) the extent towhich a human being may choose to be wicked is related to theextent to which he could choose to be good, (b) the extent towhich a soul may be attacked is related to the extent to which itis capable of defending itself, and (c) the power that the humanwill could generate is related to the power to which it is subject.It is one thing piously to marvel at the wonderful structure ofthe universe, but it is another to realise that our very use of thatimplies the existence of principles according to which thatstructure was established. An appreciation of these abstrusepoints may not concern everyone, but for the person who isinterested they constitute a kind of ‘inner knowledge’ – one thatis not necessarily forbidden so much as ‘beyond the mind’scapacity to conceive’.2. Is inner knowledge kept for a chosen few?There is a proper place and time for humility, and there isanother time and place for assuming your powers with dignity."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"You don't go to bed in Occult Robes, neither do you confrontThe Beyond dressed in your pyjamas. Come to that, you shouldnot go into battle wearing a fig leaf! If there is any innerknowledge, then it is being kept from you (or rather: you areunable to reach it) simply because you are not ready. It hasnothing to do with being Teacher's pet or having blue eyes. I amnot allowed to expose such matters to your untutored gaze.Curiosity killed the cat!3. Does a Master reveal his secret knowledge?It is not in the contract and you can't shove new clauses in afteryou both signed. The Master's goal is to ‘actualise’ your full,natural potential and so make you happy. If you are a futureInitiate, then you would not be happy unless he led you towardfull knowledge. In that case, certain things can be taken asunderstood, even if they were not spelled out. But you don't get‘the lot’ as a matter of course.4. Then access to ‘knowledge’ is denied?I didn't say that. You're being petulant. All I said was: you don'tget ‘the lot’ as a matter of course. That was not the job yourMaster took on. But there is nothing to stop you looking forKnowledge if you know how. Remember though: you have noright to intrude on the Beyond. The Path is esoteric. That is tosay, you need to speak before you learn the alphabet, and youneed to read before you decide to write books. Knowledgecomes in steps, much like the pyramids in Guatemala.5. Why the need for secrecy?Society is hostile to Occultism. The Church saw to that. We areevil, something to be attacked and, if possible, burned at thestake! The Dominican monks would dismantle your body to rootout any odd ideas.

It's not my job to explain what others mayhave said, neither do I feel called upon to justify my teachingsusing their terms.

I do not see myself ascompeting for your attention or trying to participate in some sortof global contest for the most popular magician of the year.2. Why are Occult books difficult?If a book is difficult to grasp, this doesn’t mean that it explainsthings badly. Perhaps the brain is unable to take it in. In anycase, an expert’s idea of a good explanation might not work forthe man-in-the-street, but is it therefore at fault?On a television programme, a comedian faces a professorfrom Oxford and says: ‘All right, Professor, if you’re so clever,explain nuclear physics to me.’ It’s an unfair joke. When you tryto understand Occultism, are your demands any fairer? It will behard work so seeing the light will not be a triumph and notunderstanding will not be failure.Of course, it has to be said that there is another kind ofoccult book which seeks to impress one with its serious intent bybeing deliberately obscure. ‘Ooo, I can’t say more about that,’ itseems to warn, or ‘Dearie, dearie me, wash your mouth out withsalt and holy water!’ An air of mystery is built up, with anatmosphere of dread or a tone of trespassing on forbiddenground.

Are people too easily impressed by occult jargon?Understandably so. It is part and parcel of any pleasurablepursuit or pastime, to know the ‘in’ terms, the secret language,or the jargon of the fraternity. Using it demonstrates to othermembers that you too belong. In my contact with some veryfamous people, I've noticed that they enjoy playing with thevocabularies of various branches of Occultism. They are almostlike computer buffs, except that there's nothing in it. Jargon ispretentious nonsense which hides the futility of a branch ofstudies. It leads you up a blind alley!4. What are your views on Cabbala?Why would you prefer a system of magic that is simply foreignand exotic? Cabbala had its origins in the Middle Ages. It was aneat cover for Occultists when the Inquisition walked the streets.One was only studying the Bible, after all! So far as I can tell noone has yet found a single secret of any practical value! In spiteof this, scores of books are available, most of them quiteexpensive.5. What is Enochian?It is an artificial language first invented by Dr John Dee, thefamous courtier during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Since hewas also a spy, he was quite used to codes and ciphers. Theobjections against this language being ‘genuine’ are: the Beyonddoes not need any language; this one has complex letters; nospirits appear to use it; Dr Dee needed to curry favour. It isprobably a confidence trick."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"6. Is there any mystic language?Why would the gods need the same kind of security as theAmerican secret service? If the gods can hear and respond toany individual, then they can also understand any tongue thatmankind has invented. When we speak, we form concepts in ourminds. The Gods can hear our minds. If we make an utterance itis more to have a psychological impact on others. This is thetheatrical aspect of magic.7. What about Crowley's ‘Magick Voice’?He was not suggesting that the Gods were deaf! Once again hewas telling us that speech, like the rest of our ritual behaviour,ought to be special. This was in order to separate the sacredfrom the profane. In other words, when we have dealings withthe Beyond, we ought not to do so in a manner that isreminiscent of our weary, ordinary, day-to-day life.8. What does one see in somebody's aura?First of all, a person's aura isn't always visible and even when itis visible, there can be confusion and loss of clarity. Most thingsreflect the internal condition of the individual - his health, hisworries, and (strangely enough) his recent sexual experiences.So I see whether or not he's in a bad state and I can usuallydiscern wounds and scars from the past. However it is never myplace to judge; the gift is only there in order to help.9. Do you write-off Astrology?As it is popularly thought of, yes. This does not mean that thereare no stars out there or no other life in the universe. Aleisterwas not deluded by the notions of astrology.

Just as theories about alien life-forms are a form ofcollective ‘wish projection’ that can lead from self-delusion toeventual madness.A similar thing has been happening as regardsarchaeological remains, e.g., the Incas, Stonehenge and cavepaintings in Morocco. The cause célèbre that has been made ofUFOs is perhaps the most striking example of all, whilethousands of people have found great significance in the so-called ‘crop circles’ – in spite of the fact that the perpetrators ofthe hoaxes have actually confessed.These things allow a person to gather in a little hope.Although there may be very little basis for such hope, no onecan prove that it is entirely false. So it is that a person canconvince himself that his ‘belief’ is a much more positiveresponse than simply allowing himself to wallow in despair.

At the same time, if aproduct is expensive then, by implication, it ought to do the jobbetter."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"In France, doctors are perfectly well aware that sick patientsare more likely to get well if their ego is flattered by being givenan armful of exotic medicines to carry down the street.

I do not wish inany way to disappoint you, and I am concerned to meet yourneeds, but I am duty-bound to resist the temptation. Bear withme. Let me use magic that is not mere mumbo-jumbo.6. What has this to do with magic?It illustrates the power of belief and should lead you on to aconsideration of the energy that resides in the Will. Studies havebeen done on most products - soap, shoes, cigarettes, or beer -you name it, work has been done. Professions too. For instance,we know what clients expect from plastic surgeons, priests andprostitutes. I'm not suggesting there's any connection!A person builds opinions on the basis of what other peoplethink, but not just any other people, but a special pool of personswhose views he respects. Normally, he uses different set foreach area of opinion - one for film, a second for politics, a thirdfor sport and so on.Most of these ‘significant others’ feature in only one set. Afew will feature in several, and perhaps just one person willcount in all of them. Think about this and look again at yourviews on Occultism and magic - they are not as personal as youimagined. So where did they come from? Who gave them toyou? Why?"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Surely, we must distinguish between ‘cod magic’ that worksthrough the inherent weaknesses or system faults of the humanbeing, and ‘real magic’ that relies on some alignment, or evensome controlled tension, between a person’s in-dwelling powersand those external powers that exist in the natural andsupernatural worlds around him. It might be appropriate tomeasure the former by your degree of stupefaction, but the latterrises above such considerations as emotional reaction orintellectual understanding. A stage performer may strive toobtain applause – he is entertaining – but the true magician isrendering a necessary service and looking after the universe.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Special powers1.

If you show any potential,someone may offer to teach you, but not necessarily myself.4. Can you help people to success?Of course, but only if that success will help them make progresson the spiritual path.

AsI have said before: a good parent would not give atomicweapons to a child. Besides, it would not be very healthy for meif I got a kick out of ruining people.6. Would you perform magic for a fee?To be utterly truthful: that would depend on the type of magicbeing sought. I would not allocate an unfair advantage. I wouldnot cause rivals to be sick. I would not help someone to avoidsome event that was needed to their eventual well-being. But Iwould gladly do such things as: help a young man master hisshyness, relax the tongue of someone who stutters, heal theeczema of a child that is grieving because of a divorce, and soon. There is a line that I would not cross, and each request has tobe judged on its merits. One accepts a fee because one must alsoeat. But these are not fixed. I adjust the fee according to anindividual's ability to pay. This means that I often go hungry.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Black Magic1. What about ‘black magic’?Black Magic is more the style of Hitler, Caligula or some Kingsof France. It is used to seek power over others, and is then akind of psychic slavery. Just as with the Mafia Dons, thepersonal ambitions of a Black Magician are very much those ofa normal person: nice car, nice house, swimming-pool, goodfood and the best sex. Instead of working for it though, theysteal it by foul means. The Mafia Dons are mostly in Sicilywhile the power behind Black Magic arises from forces that aresimilarly antithetical to ‘the order in the cosmos’.2. How does black magic differ from white?The main thing is the ‘intention’ and the ‘will’ which are behindthe deeds. A Black Magician has already surrendered himself tothe Lords of Chaos and is serving their goals. A White Magicianis dedicated to Nature and Divine Order, and is usually workingfor the benefit of the people in his community.3. Can one get embroiled in black magic by chance?Oh yes! You certainly can. By trying a little ill-judged magic, bytasting a little carefree sex, by saying too much at the wrongmoment, and many other things which bring you close to evil.This is why self-mastery is so vital. If you know yourself, youcan protect yourself. But don't ever consider yourself to bestronger than the powers of evil or proof against all temptation.And certainly not on the grounds that you now have a Master!Every Occultist is a potential target.4. How can one recognise black magic?Be suspicious of any system, and chary of any teacher, whopromises everything, and says there is no danger. Be on your"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"guard against flattery. When someone starts buttering you upwith a trowel, keep one hand on your sword. Do not fall into thetrap of easy riches, massive power, or ready sex. Spiders don'tjust make their webs sticky, they also make them sweet! Watchout for slight menace mixed with much promise. If they trycoaxing you to defy Nature, put on your running-shoes.5. What about the Black Mass?The Black Mass is no more dangerous than the mockery of anyother religious act. Be wary of anything which distorts the wordsor rituals of some other religion. An Occultist has no interest inoffending anyone, so why recite the Lord's Prayer backward orinvert the crucifix? The point about Black Magic is that itdoesn't just do evil, it turns your good acts to evil, if it can. Whatpeople hallow, Evil seeks to desecrate.6. Are you a Black Magician?If I were, I wouldn't tell you. I would not be allowed to give adirect, bare-faced lie, but I could do everything else apart fromthat. I would certainly make sure that my answer gave you thewrong impression entirely. To pin me down, you'd need to beboth alert and astute. The last thing that a Black Magician wantsis: to identify himself. That's why I'm quite happy to tell you:No! I am not a Black Magician. I work for Truth and the GreatLight.7. Can I trust your word?Look! If I were a Black Magician, I would never have raised thetopic. I would not have roused your suspicions or put you onyour guard. To be quite honest, far from rolling out a red carpetand inviting you into my parlour, I'd have been putting hurdlesin your path! These are not the tactics of a fox who is out to naba rabbit. Moreover, when we meet, you can test me with garlicor Holy Water!"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"8. Do you believe in ‘False Occultists’?I have already said that there are hoaxers, cheats, con-men androgues. But there are also quite sincere people who happen tobelieve in false doctrines. I do not despise them as people. I donot ask that they be punished. But in the meantime they quiteoften try to do things which I regard as evil. In all sincerity, Ican not stand by and just let that happen. I would be guilty ofinaction in face of evil.9. Who the hell are you to interfere?Would you expect a doctor to ignore an accident in the street?Would you expect the police not to help an old lady across theroad? I would not interfere with their free will, but one has aduty to thwart their actions. Let me put it this way: I don't stingbees; I just stop them stinging me.10. How do you thwart evil people?As regards people with wicked intentions, the best and simplestdefence is to turn their deeds back against their own heads. Ifthey resort to evil powers or evil entities, then I just have a wordwith such agents and authorise them to rebel. As regards naivepeople who do not appreciate how evil their thoughts andactions are, I just deny their access to supernatural power, andgive them an object lesson. You could call the method: closeencounters of the purgative kind.11. How and why are you able to do this?I have a perfect right to do it. I am a Magician and I have beengiven authority by The Beyond. Now I accept that this maystrike your ears as absurd, and you might feel inclined to scoff.But others have scoffed, and they have stopped!"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"If I were a fraud, mentally ill or just suffering from delusionsof grandeur then why has not one Occult group ever succeededin using magic against me?

But youmight me nervous of your own fears and the creations of yourown imagination. But even though I am a fairly big man - verymuch like my father, in fact - I am also very gentle with it. It issmall people, and small-minded people you should be afraid of.History shows that they are far more likely to get violent.2. How do you react to personal offence?I have to be cautious. My father, Aleister Crowley, provided mewith astral guardians. It will help you understand better if youthink of them as mystic Rottweilers, but not as intelligent! Justlike their earthly counterparts, they have an inclination to attackfirst, and drag the bodies out after. If only they would not trot upand drop those bits of people's psyche at my feet! It ruffles myvisitors so.3. This seems an unfair advantage.Yes, it does, doesn't it? But you have to face facts and bear inmind that when one is a Master, there are far too many idiotswho want to play ‘Billy the Kid’! They leap from dark doorwaysand challenge me to a fight. Now I have done nothing to deservethese tiresome attacks. Which is where the flaming Rottweilerscome in. One growl would pacify a race-riot.4. Is there any danger of ‘an accident’?That's the snag! How clever of you to notice. There is a dangerthat my dogs will see a threat where none exists. The last time ithappened was when a friend was telling me about a film bySylvester Stallone. He got excited, or carried away and made toomany gesticulations. Then, as I just said, he got carried away!"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"So, I spend much time calming them. I beam at folk inanely as Iquietly stroke the invisible Rottweilers. But as my father himselfadvised: ‘For Christ's sake, keep them off the bloody boil’. ForChrist's sake, I try.5. Are you tempted to use them in anger?Oh yes. When someone goes on playing silly buggers long afterI've warned them. I just lift my finger and, in a split second, halftheir psychic trousers disappear - often the leg goes with it. Or ifI let slip an inch of leash, the fool opposite has his ego raked bya nasty set of astral claws. I notice that they are much nicerafterwards. Apart from that, I walk away from quarrelsomesituations in order to save any embarrassment. A spoiled child ismost hurt by being ignored.6. Why make light of this?Any other tone, and I bet you would not take me seriously! Thefacts are grave enough. There is no need for atmospheric musictoo. Let me put it this way: these things protect me, whether ornot I think I'm in danger. To a large extent, they are outside mypersonal control. I am not one to suffer fools gladly. I have atendency to be irritable. Now either I let passers-by get diced byintergalactic canines or ... I try to control my reactions. Hencemy sense of humour.7. Don't you feel pity for such people?It is hard to feel pity for evil, arrogance and stupidity. If theyadmit their error, I do what I can to repair the worst effects. Ifthey become students (and for this, stupidity is not necessarilyan obstacle) I will endeavour to change their behaviour. In themeantime, it is best to ignore such people. Misplaced sympathyis a danger because one must not compromise with evil. By theway, would anyone like a Rottweiler pup?"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"8. Can I walk away without coming to harm?Absolutely! But on condition that you are courteous and thatyou do not try to do me harm either. But if you come along justto amuse yourself or to collect an autograph, then I willprobably get cross with you.9. Do you blast people with magic?Only if I give them due warning first, because everyone has theright to back down or say sorry. But if I am badly wronged, Iwould normally resort to a magic ritual in which I draw theattention of The Beyond to a certain person's name. Thus, Iwould almost always leave things to judgement in a highercourt.10. You mean you never ‘hit’ people?Well, no, I'm afraid I can't say that. In spite of trying to keep tosome very high standards, I have never claimed to be anythingelse but a human being. So I can occasionally lose my temperand be particularly furious. But before I myself can actually dosomething, my astral guardians have usually taken actionanyway.11. Do you ever destroy people?This is rather like asking a soldier if he has ever shot anyone.None of us has the right to bury his head in the sand and ignorethe rest of humanity. We have a duty, by virtue of simply beingalive, of protecting and helping others. I do not kill or huntanimals. But I would use force to rescue someone who wasattacked by an animal, just as I would go to almost any lengthsto defend my child against another human being.12. Are you a vengeful man?The tone of your question implies that this would be wrong.

When we do wrong, either we apologiseand try to put things right - or else we pay. Now I overlook thosewho do me wrong by chance, without intending to do so, ormerely by naiveté or immaturity. But neither I nor anyone else isallowed to interfere when human beings offend against cosmiclaw. It is they who bring down retribution on their own heads.13. Would you help such a person?My powers come from the Cosmos and so I am not morepowerful than the Cosmos. It is unthinkable that anyone shouldtry to turn that power against its own source. If it were possibleto intercede, then I would try. But this is most unlikely. The onlytimes when I may be able to help is when someone gets introuble either with evil, or with mundane matters on this plane.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Good and Evil1. What is the biggest evil?While I am appalled by many things - e.g., cruelty to children,neglect of old-folk, and religious massacres - I see that behindthem is a type of mental or spiritual derangement. I see thecollapse of human reason, or its devolution, as a type ofinsidious evil that is ever-present. By being the creature that weare, our consciousness teeters on the brink of failure. It is whywe dare. It is how we risk all in order to win all. This is why Iam so opposed to the use of alcohol or any other kind of drug: Iabhor the recreational flirtation with ultimate catastrophe.2. Where else do you see evil?Modern sexual attitudes, the breakdown of the family, theconsequent harm to children, homelessness and total mentaldisorientation! Without arguing about the rights and wrongs ofthis or that new ‘freedom’, I can see how many of them havecontributed to a larger change which seems to lead todisintegration on both the personal and social levels.3. Do you have enemies?Yes. But when you know their names, you will see this as anendorsement. By the same token, if these same people had beenfriends, you would have had good grounds for doubting mysincerity. Another interesting point: the people who dislike memost have never even met me. I leave you to guess what theirmotives might be.4. Do you fight wicked people?Not unless I have to. Every man is free to injure his own soul.We may interfere only if someone does harm to others.

But if one of them tries to harman Occultist, then the Master may intervene. If they are daftenough to attack a Master, he may turn their evil against them.5. Does a Master have authority over Evil?Insofar as he is equivalent to an army General, he may do whathe thinks fit. He can search, arrest, confiscate or even destroy.Did you know, for example, that he has the power and the rightto restrain spirits? Surely you've heard about the genie in thebottle? Well, in a manner of speaking, that can be done, and theydon't like it. A Master can order a being to appear before himand bind their conduct under pain of a certain peril. The Masteris a Legate for the Beyond, and when he talks in that capacity,God help those who show no respect.6. Are there lesser punishments?Often, it's enough to denounce someone, or to draw him to theattention of supernatural agents. One can leave him to theircharge. The magical theory behind this ancient deed is called:The Dreadful Naming of Names. A Master has only to point atsomeone and either pronounce their name, or say ‘This one’,and the old power swings into action. To guard against accidentand anger, he has to use a special tone of voice.7. Do you believe in the Devil?What difference would that make? Whatever I may or may notbelieve, it is not my object to make you believe the same. Youmay keep your opinions on condition that you first examinethem more critically. The one thing I do not tolerate is the stanceof an ostrich! I won't allow you to bury your head in the sandand pretend that everything is nice and cosy. Whatever the realenemies may be, when you eventually uncover them, a Masterwill ask you to face up to reality and he will help you to facethem."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Until you achieve that ground, it is wise to adopt the stancethat a Devil probably exists and to take appropriate precautions.You may well wish me to explain further and in greater detail,but I have to balance this against the human (and often fatal)fascination with forbidden dangers. I have to strike a happymedium between being evasive and saying too much – and thequestion of what might be ‘too much’ for beginners like yourselfis a very tricky subject!8. Is it dangerous to be an Occult student?Yes, but more dangerous still not to be. There is risk in dailylife, but you take it in your stride. Driving a car is one example.Eating fast food is another! An Occultist puts a glint in the eyeof evil but, naturally, a Master is like a four-star General: amuch better target than a common soldier. Let's put it this way:you may get shot at by a sniper but I'm more likely to getshelled! Why are you in the firing-line at all? Well, when youtake a Master, you identify with his cause. You are no longer aneutral peasant whom nobody gives a damn about. You havesigned up with the Whites. It is quite logical that the Blacksdon't like you.9. I think I'll stay a coward.There is no need to run away. A cosmic law states that no one isexposed to greater danger than he can resist. So there you are,you see. You are not up the creek without a paddle! When youbecome an Occultist you are given sufficient power to fight offany likely attack. The higher you climb, the more attractive atarget you become, but the greater the power of your defencestoo. So instead of being terrified of manifestations of evil, youshould be proud, because they prove your spiritual value. In anycase, running will not save you: a moving target is easier to see!"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"10. And if I am afraid?That would suggest that you are at least normal. I'm afraid too. Iam afraid of what would happen if I were a coward andhesitated to pick up my destiny. In any case, Nature makes usafraid for a positive purpose. She wants to put us on guard, totake precautions against some threatening danger. The object ofsuch fear is not to paralyse us or induce a state of inaction.What I am suggesting is: it may not be good to stop, but neitheris it wise to run. Fear is meant to provoke or invoke otherresponses than ‘oh dear’ or ‘Oh my God’. If one allows fearitself to dominate, then one might as well jump overboard andabandon ship. Far better to exert your will.11. How can I resist Evil?Apart from any Occult or magical acts, you can bolster your willby getting rid of jealousy, throwing away any thirst for power,and letting go of any wish for revenge. You'd also do very wellif could be sure that your sexuality grew out of pure love, notjust lust, violence or fear.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Sex1. Should sex be enjoyed?Nature, and therefore God, made it enjoyable. So much so thatmany creative artists have described it as the closest thing tospiritual ecstasy that human beings can achieve of their ownvolition. But some religions make it cause shame, guilt andmental conflict. It would help a person enormously if he couldbreak these chains on his morality. But we don't demand thatyou do that. You are free to make your own decisions.2. Do you disapprove of morals?They are essential to group life. But I would look again at oneswhich inhibit freedom or cause ill-health. People are what theyare, and they feel as they happen to feel. It is not for me oranyone else to lay down rules ... except to protect the individualliberty of others. So Occultism never forces anything on itsstudents. They are always perfectly free to pack it in and leavewhenever they wish. So if this kind of thing brings you out in acold sweat, let us change the subject and talk about, er, whiterabbits. Or does that have sexual connotations too?3. Does Occultism focus on sex?No, I wouldn't say that. Of course, unlike the Christian Churchwe don't frown upon sexuality. We think it is a perfectly propersubject, just like anything else that is important to life. But anyamount of sex might seem ‘a lot’ in the eyes of a committedChristian. As a matter of fact, it is interesting to ask why onereligion is so nervous on the subject, when most other religionsare quite calm and impartial. It is not just believed - it is knownthat certain cosmic energies are generated or transferred bymeans of sexuality, as well as in other ways too. Tantrism is a"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"form of esoteric study in which the power behind sexuality is thefocus of attention.4. This must attract some base people?It does not seem to. In any case, if anyone were just looking fortitillation or fun, there are quicker and simpler ways of findingit. Even those few people who are drawn to Occultism primarilyby their interest in sex soon identify an inner evil which theymay then change for the better. Occultists do not believe that sexis inherently bad, but ‘bad sex’ does exist. In spite of thechurch's point of view, the Devil has no great interest in any ofthis. He is said to be a fallen angel with lots of feathers. But asan angel, upright or fallen, he has no sexual organs. It is thechurches which fix the Satanic mask on any aspect of sexuality,and perhaps this is done just to disguise a certain ‘secretknowledge’. At the end of the day, sex is but one manifestationof a great and awesome power. They don't want you to find outabout its other uses.5. What's all this about energy?Electricity is one type of energy, and yet it can perform severalfunctions, e.g., give light, cause heat, emit x-rays, move things,make long-distance communication possible and so on. At thesame time it can prove fatal if it is handled wrongly. The samesort of thing can be said about sex. It can do a great deal ofgood, or a great deal of harm. It can heal and it can damage. Itcan strengthen your mind or destroy sanity. It can open the doorto a secret power in magic or it can slam that door in your face.6. What good does ‘good sex’ do?The first aim of self-mastery is to gain access to heightenedstates of consciousness. When your senses are energised andyour perception is raised, your soul is liberated from the flesh. Itis capable of seeing much of the truth for itself. This facilitatesgreat progress. Many of our questions become quite"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"unnecessary. This is why priestly religions have tried to makesex taboo, to lock the doors and keep the energies in their ownhands. If all and any sexual activity could be improved, mademore fulfilling, or raised to the level of ‘a communion with thegods’ ... then that would have an immense value to us as humanbeings. It would liberate new powers. It would enable us to thinkof some derring-do!7. So what is sex magic?It is a way of harnessing the creative forces of the cosmos inorder to focus them on your magical work and your spiritualtraining. We must not be afraid that sex is nice. Cosmic lawdoesn't forbid it for such a simple reason. It is a lie to say thatnasty things are good for the soul. That is Puritanism and totallyunnatural. The main act of Christian worship is based on foodand drink: that which sustains life. Is it so very different toregard the creation of life as something sacred too? It alldepends on will.8. Is there a second type of sex magic?Yes. It has a practical aim of helping men to find sexualhappiness. This it does by helping to wipe out fears and anyproblems. It is a man's natural duty to make his woman happy sothat the pair of them may be propelled toward the state ofmutual ecstasy. By Magic, one can boost the pleasure of orgasmtwice, thrice or even a hundredfold. Far from being evil, onebecomes proof against many nervous ills and madness.9. I hear there are ‘magical sex acts’?Which is a coy way of approaching a delicate subject. Fastingcan whet the appetite.

Do you see homosexuality as natural?Nature simply did not intend man to prefer his own sex. Itwanted him to get on with the business of reproduction. Butthere is nothing wrong with two people of the same sex lovingeach other and finding happiness together. From a scientificpoint of view, a homosexual is probably someone whoseemotional development was halted in early adolescence.Whether or not it could be resumed depends on individualcircumstances and personal wishes, but there is no need foranyone to suffer socially or spiritually. Occultists are not afraidof the subject, or embarrassed by its implications.2. What is your view of homosexuality?I have sympathy and I do not feel horrified. But I also recognisea certain level of frenzy that is close to panic. I am reminded ofthe decadence of pre-war Berlin. As a Master, I regardhomosexuality as an unnatural deviation from the way we aremeant to be. It is not so much homosexual acts which worry me,as the inability to choose. And we must not offend the Gods bypretending that it is all part of the divine will.3. What about ‘Gay Lib’?I agree that no form of sexual expression should be classified ascrime. But not all forms of sexuality should be held up asexemplars to children. Homosexuality cannot really count as afull and valid replacement for heterosexuality. For certainpeople it has to be their way of expressing their sexuality, but Iwish they would do it with dignity and self-respect.

He accuses othersof being ‘homophobic’, while he himself risks standing at theopposite extreme, of being ‘hetero-phobic’. This would be fineif he showed any social responsibility! But he's willing to forcechanges which would threaten society. He should deal with hisdistress in a more meaningful way.5. Can Occultism cure gay people?It is wrong to think of being gay as something that needs to becured, as if it were a disease. This is a very sensitive issuebecause (a) it affects a significant number of people, and (b)some of those people have become militant and turned thesubject into a political issue. As with questions to do withracism, feminism or religion, to speak at all is to risk outragingsomeone. The best position to adopt is that we might be able tohelp some of the people who are gay contrary to their owndeeper wishes.A separate question concerns the magical energies that areliberated by all sexual activities. While those that originate ingay activity could be positive, they are more likely to bediverted to dangerous or self-destructive character. This isprobably because gay people justify their sexual behaviour ondifferent grounds to the majority of non-gay people."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"A good viewpoint to adopt with a person of any tendency isnot to criticise but to consider the beneficial goals: ‘Hey, wouldyou like to boost your sex-life by a factor of up to twenty?Would you be interested in turning orgasms into intergalacticsupernovas of ecstasy?’6. What if it didn't work?Well, the aim is not to ‘cure’ the person. The aim is to make himhappier. So as long as his sex-life is not actually worse, then hehas not failed. The odds are that any regime directed at self-fulfilment will bring improvement of some sort. If the guy doesnot become straight, that is no problem as long as he becomes a‘sorted-out’ gay and ditches his spiritual sadness.7. Was Aleister Crowley homosexual?He had enough children in and out of wedlock to proveotherwise. In any case, the phenomenon is not hereditary! As faras I know, Aleister Crowley was not even bisexual. What thereports really fail to remark is that Crowley never hesitated touse sexual energy in working magic.8. Wasn’t Aleister a ‘close friend’ of Rasputin?But Rasputin was his magical twin! Remember too that Rasputinalso had a reputation for being a lady-killer. As a matter of fact,he was married, and fathered several children. One of hisdaughters wrote a biography of him! In any case, he and myfather met only a few times: twice in St. Petersburg, and once atMount Athos, in Greece.9. What is the doctrine of a Magical Twin?There is a special kind of mystic fellowship which can existbetween two people for non-sexual reasons. The emotions are sodeep and strong that they may subjectively perceived as ‘love’.But there is no carnal desire and no lust. The motivation seems"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"to be that each twin feels a need to merge his personality withthe other and so achieve a high level of psychic power.10. Is there any link with homosexuality?Only in the sense that many gays are not homosexual at all.They are mystic twins who have been misled by their emotions.They're confused by the strange nature of the event. Few peoplerealise that mystic twins exist, so it is easy to draw the wrongconclusion. Occult students needn't be nervous. Twins areuncommon. But when they do occur, there is often a surge inpsychic skills and magical powers.11. It all sounds a bit far-fetched.Then forget it. It is not a required belief and it makes nodifference to Occult status. Of course, it may well be that somepeople are ‘sensitive’ about anything to do with sex. One mightask why alarm-bells are always ringing. It is none of mybusiness though - unless it interferes with your happiness oryour freedom to make progress.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Spirits1. Can we contact the Beyond?So it appears. This is usually done with a medium but one has tobe sure that the medium is honest, and that the spirits are exactlywhat they claim. Student experiments can be catastrophic!Entities at various levels of development seem to come through- anything from senseless poltergeists to unknown Masters. Theexact nature of the phenomena and which entities arrive,depends on the composition of the group and the state ofpeople's minds.2. Do you recommend spiritualist seances?If there are spirits – and by this I mean, if there is such a thing asnon-corporeal or abiotic existence – then this is strong evidencein favour of the existence of a God, or Gods. Once we realisethat there is something more than mere matter then otherpossibilities really do open up. For that reason alone, seancescan be very helpful. Alas, one has to be aware of trickery! Andif spirits do manifest, what do you do if they are evil ones? Onthe whole, I'd say: keep good company. This is one of those eye-catching topics that are best explored later.3. How should we think of the dead?Like unborn babies, we look on the dead as full members of ourcommunity. If we neglect or overlook them, we must expectthem to be peevish. When something ‘goes wrong’ in your life,it pays to recall whether you have observed your duties towardthe full community. Someone recently dead can also get lost. Hemay need our help before the ‘Sweepers’ find him."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"4. What happens to spirits between reincarnations?It is tempting to think that they apply for unemployment pay!But the root of the problem that you are trying to address lies ina glaring statistic: the number of dead who have ever livedoutnumber the present population by only 5 to 1 and the figuresare changing. This can only be explained if ‘new’ souls arecreated from time to time. Of course, it is possible that soulsmay split in two, or that individual souls are divided from acentral core like tufts of cotton wool being pulled off a huge roll.In any event, as Occultists, we believe that souls can existoutside of a human shell. This is evidenced by the phenomenonof astral travel by humans and by the transmigration of souls.Sso there is no difficulty in imagining (some of) them as ‘astralnomads’.5. Can beings from Beyond possess us?Yes, but to accomplish this, either our own soul has left thebody vacant, or it has been so weakened by something that anentity can more or less force its way in. It is not always obviouswhen one is possessed. Certain states which pass for mentalillness could very well be examples of possession.6. What makes possession more likely?A very weak will is the most enticing thing - that plus apowerful charge of negative energy. This negative energy cancome from such things as: jealousy, anguish, bad sex, need forrevenge and similar emotional states, past or present.7. Can the squatter be expelled?He may be, but it doesn't follow that he will be. When an entityhas been in place without detection for a long time his hold onthe soul is that much more persistent.

Notice theremedies, as they are remembered: stakes in the heart, silverbullets, garlic, sunlight and so on. All of them are sexualsymbols which suggest negative forces due to bad sex.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Wicca1. How do you regard witchcraft?It is little more than peasant magic. It became organised whenAleister Crowley was paid to design a structure and write itsrituals. It has since become a naughty pastime for those whodaren't be more open. In olden times, sorcerers were the lay-preachers, or the district nurses of Occultism. They stood inwhen for an absent Master. They were taught by him, and hetopped up their power from time to time. Now they are naught.2. Do you condemn Wicca or Witchcraft?I condemn all spiritual hypocrites and impostors. But that said, Ihave a certain spiritual fondness for those who are sincere intheir Wiccan or Witchcraft beliefs. For reasons we that won't gointo, it was common for them to attack Aleister Crowley, or topour scorn on him. But very recently, they have stopped doingso. Given that Crowley helped Gerald Gardner to found modernwitchcraft, I maintain that there is part of witchcraft which isquite valid. But the larger part of it had much more to do withpersonal taste and I have nothing to say about it.3. Is Wicca valid as a ‘preliminary step’?That depends on the character of the person who leads thegroup. Without now wishing to offend them, I see Wicca andWitchcraft as Protests Priests might see ‘Lay Preachers’. Whatthey do is certainly evidence of religiosity, but it doesn't go farenough and it is a bit weak on theology and doctrine. All thatsaid, I would be happy to take on a student who was a Wiccan -all other things being equal. And I would be comfortable to meetWiccans. In general they are not wicked people, even thoughthey do have the occasional black sheep. But then, who doesn't! 4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Feminism1. Do Occultists support women's lib?Men and women are different and we exaggerates suchdifferences for social purposes. Neither sex is superior and thereis no natural dominance. Any impulse to change sex, or swapsex roles, arises from damage to the psyche and can often becaused by bad sex, or negative energy. Both of which can bedealt with. Vis-à-vis the political movement for equality, I findwomen are pawns being used by evil. The hand that rocks thecradle is the hand that rules the world! So who, or what, has toldwomen to be aggrieved? They've been aggrieved a long timebefore ever they became ‘Women's Libbers’!2. Do women have equal opportunities?That depends. I would not let a man be Queen, or put a womanin The Hairy Legs Competition. But I have students of severalsexes and I do my best for them all. But a woman can not be afather, any more than a man could be a mother, so it surprisesme that we can overlook our natural roles so easily. Sex is theonly important difference and it plays an important role inmagic. Is the Women's Lib movement a way of sabotaging therule of Nature? As for individuals who have problems - magiccan deal with them. Our aim, remember, is individual happinessfirst.4BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Politics and religion1. What is the origin of kingship?In times of great calamity, ancient people offered the gods theirmost precious possession: their own eldest son. To ensure thatevery family suffered equally, they selected the best fromamong all eldest sons. Since he was now the chosen one, hisbrow was marked with gold to signify the divine light. And untilthe call came for him to die, this King would live in luxury. Atthis time, the title was not hereditary and no political power wasattached to the role. That came later when kings themselvesplotted to be elevated to the status of gods.2. Are religion and politics linked?They have been, ever since power-seekers realised how peoplecan be subdued by priests. It was when cities first appeared, andslavery along with them, that religion was nationalised. Theyeven changed the Gods to give more oomph to the politics. Itwas King Henry VIII made The Church of England. Mussolini,Franco, Hitler and South American dictators came to anunderstanding with the Vatican. Islamic Fundamentalists arebehind the upheavals in the Middle East.3. Why are some religions persecuted?They are seen as a threat to the status quo. This is whyChristians were martyred in ancient Rome. It is why Jews werepersecuted in Europe. It's why Jews don't think much of theArabs! It even explains why Occultism first went occult! It hadto hide from other religions in order to survive. Each religionsuits a different kind of society. Occult societies would givepower to an elite. This is why most modern society is againstOccultism. It's not so much that they're religious, but they useChristian-based law to stop us. One student was interrogated by"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"the police for three days, because he hired a room at acommunity centre for a talk on Occultism!4. What is wrong with modern politics?I believe that the science of politics, like the minds of men, hasbecome exclusively attached to goods and their production. Yes,the human lot, for many countries, has been vastly improved.But that will not avail much if we go on to remove the wholepoint of living. If we consider only creature comforts .. food,house, cars, leisure and sex .. then we are no different fromanimals. They have precisely those same aims. I prefer that weshould continue to pursue the unique qualities in man and infertheir purpose.5. Why does nationalism explode?During the historical process, larger and more powerful statesgobble up smaller ones. After the passage of time, certaingeographical areas become economically deprived or stagnant.Having little to hope for, some people try to revive a romanticimage of the past.They cause a crisis to do with roots, origins and nationalidentity. It happens even in advanced democracies such asAustralia or the United States of America. In both these cases,there’s a sense of social guilt to do with native people or ex-slaves. The dominant race finds it hard to forgive itself, whilethe down-trodden or underprivileged respond with irrationalhatred.From an Occultist’s point of view, extreme nationalism orracism simply don’t look back far enough. They stop at aspecific historical period convenient to their ideology. In fact, allhumans share a common ancestry. This is proved by geneticstudies. Our remote ancestors lacked writing so the only‘records’ we have are myths, dreams and the unconscious mind."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"6. Is it wrong to be proud of one's nationality?No. Not at all. But do please remember the extent to whichpoliticians make use of patriotism (a) to fight wars, and (b) todistract a population from problems within the country's ownborders.Feel proud of your homeland but people are people whereverthey happen to live. Culture is only a coat of paint on top of thatnature. There seem to be some ‘pockets’ of people, certaingroups, which develop within the human race in much the samethat malignant cells develop within the human body, i.e., likecancers.

Are you against Animal Testing, or Ecology or ..?I am against people who have to ask irrelevant questions. Doesit make any significant difference to what I teach? Do you askthat question of car-park attendants, hair-dressers, doctors ormurderers? If your willingness to accept truth is conditional - ifyou will only accept truth which your current opinions mayendorse - then you are either blind or you are a dangerous fool.2. Are you saying these issues aren’t important?I am saying that you must work out your eternal priorities a bitmore sensibly! If you reject truth because it isn't convenient,then no one can ever teach you. All we can do is lick your bootsand flatter your ego. Do not summon God, the Gods, or evensome Devils to tell him or them what they ought to be like.Truth is whatever it is, and your duty is to find out what thatmay be. It is not your place to manipulate the truth, nor to searchonly for facts and evidence which would prop up your ownprejudices. To be a Seeker you must be ready for some shocks.3. Are you against all causes?There are many, many causes that are worthy and noble. It is notmy place to tell people what they do with their lives and howthey spend their free time. But no cause can replace a religion. Itcannot act as a substitute for a spiritual faith. In that sensetherefore, it is my duty to point out what is reasonable and whatis unreasonable. I would also point out that some militantsupporters of a cause are every bit as fanatic and as emotionallyembroiled as extremists in the religious realm.The evidence shows that people with causes tend to misusethem.

Do you go along with secrecy?No. I go along with discretion, care, and proper consideration ofother people. Beside: many a ‘secret’ is quite able to revealitself. There's no need for anyone to start raving or ripping offveils in a frenzy. Why must you think in terms of children'sbooks or Boys' Own stories? That's pure childish fantasy andwill never get you anywhere. Instead, think about some of yourmost precious souvenirs: a certain photograph, a lock of hair, ora letter from that special somebody. That is more what OccultTruth is like. It bears such spiritual value that we daren't just letothers trample on it.2. May I share Occultism with friends and family?You can make the offer but if they don't blaze with interest,don't push your luck. The danger is you'll try to share your ownenthusiasm and delight, and that won't do at all. We are not outto convert the world. We just want to try to make it safe andhappy for everyone.3.

It’s not hisfunction to be a missionary – indeed, only a few religions feelany urge to spread the word.However, if someone expresses interest, then it would bechurlish if a minister refused to speak to them.

When should I lodge my request?Well, you should not wait until you are all but certain. As withmarriage, you must make your decision on the basis of theavailable facts and take a risk. If you dither too long, the Masterwill shut up shop - he can not teach cowards how to be brave! Ifyou ask too quickly, he can show fools how to curb any haste.All things being equal, it's best to get in early.2. Shouldn’t I shop around a bit?Certainly. It is always a good idea to look for a bargain or waituntil the Summer Sales start. Of course, you will only find whatyou are looking for if you first work out how you are going tomake your choice. Most Masters do not resemble oranges, soyou shouldn’t squeeze them to see if they are ripe. Neither doyou sit on them to see whether they are comfy. Hey – how muchdo you know about Masters anyway? Could you recognise oneif you saw him? If I were you, I wouldn’t wouldn’t be too choosy,mate. Don't make it any harder than it already is. Whatever youneed, all Masters have got it!

But since none of themcost a penny, you won't be shopping for the cheapest. What'smore, they all have access to the same knowledge, you won't belooking for the cleverest. Or maybe you are someone who goesalong with the crowd and buys only what everyone else does? Ifthat's the case then let me inform you the world's most popularphilosophy is Confucianism.

Who should I look for?A Master who is willing to take you on. Now I'm not betrayingany professional secret when I say that, in general, Mastersprefer candidates who have no shopping-list.

A Master is a good person. Ifyou can't recognise a good person - give up now!5. What if I want to be my own master?Cheers! I hope you'll be accepted. No other Master will risk itwhen you have such mighty arrogance! I presume you've donethe job yourself up to now? How did it go? No offence but youprobably didn't get too far. One more point: since the Godsthought it wise to provide Masters, they'll find it odd that youdecide to ignore them. That is one step short of spitting in aMasters' face! Remind me to tell you about my Rottweilers later.That said, by all means go ahead!6. Do you accept former Criminals?Yes, but on condition that their criminal days are over. Firstly,they must cause no scandal. Secondly, they must have changedtheir stance and adopted a more altruistic point of view.7. Do you select students for their potential?An individual's potential to achieve his own destiny is all thatcounts for me. You might just as well ask if I accept studentsbecause they are physically attractive. You just have to look atthem and the answer is clear! Unless, of course, I've got dust inmy third eye.8.
