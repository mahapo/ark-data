[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"\"COMMENTARY ON THE BOOK OF THE LAW FOR pleading\" DE PANYATA In the text were used excerpts from various authors and not Thelemic Thelemic to strengthen our placements. These authors are shown at the end of \"NOTES\"These \"Notes on the Book of the Law to Supplicant\" are not just admonitions to all who are flying in \"review\" the book of the law, challenging the \"I comment\" made by Ankh-FN-Khonsu at the beginning of the text, but also to demonstrate mistranslations that lead to misinterpretation. Most of the \"esoteric\" I know, is conditioned to accept certain interpretations as fact. Comment on the Book of the Law, challenging the \"I comment\" is not a demonstration of freedom, self-determination, etc.. etc.., but rather it is an act of folly, rebellious child against Real Will . Supplicant Note : In one of the comments from Crowley (Liber AL vel Legis), is written: \" All this talk about \"suffering humanity\" is mainly based on the stupid mistake of transferring our own psychology to our neighbor. Developing Adept is for Expansion - out toward NUIT - in all directions equally. mediocre man has little experience, little capacity either for pain or for pleasure. This thesis is about the compassion of utmost importance in the ethics of Thelema.'s necessary we stop, once and for all with this ignorant interference in the lives of others. Each individual must be left free to follow their own Railroad to. \"There is one thing more irritating than Real Started encounter a \"supplicant\" that comes with humility and extreme fussiness, ask something that he can get on his own science and art. Generally people who kneel and beg, take one kick-ass.The Royal Initiates give the last drop of blood for humanity. Give the last drop of blood for humanity does not mean suffering, sacrifice, emasculate themselves or be of wicked or charitable cristista fussiness. Give the last drop of blood is to fight (at all levels) against the enemies of humanity who exactly are those mushy and charitable classified above.From what I've seen a lot of people saying Thelemite is fully inserted in the system corny, and obsessed by the terrible egregore created by cristismo and their bastard sons and daughters. I include here too esoteric systems tainted by this stain cristista: pseudamente orders are called Rosicrucian (AMORC, FRA, etc.) and other \"fraternities\" or mystical organizations following the same course. Aleister Crowley The English occultist Aleister Crowley, who cognominou THE GREAT BEAST 666, was the most feared and most innovative magician of esotericism in the twentieth century. Called \"the wickedest man in the world\" in his own country, vilified by \"initiatic orders\" and religions of the Aeon of Pisces-Virgo, has spent his entire existence trying to establish the new rhythms and religious initiation of the Age of Aquarius-Leo, as described in Book of the Law, a mysterious document obtained by him in appalling circumstances. The Book of the LawThe cornerstone of the Thelemic system, as unveiled by Aleister Crowley, is the enigmatic book known as \" The Book of the Law \", also called Liber AL, Liber Legis, Liber L, Liber or CCXX. It's a little book has been published in many forms, and currently in many linguas.Entretanto, the best translation of the book to the Portuguese language is one of Marcelo Ramos Motta (1934-1987) Crowley says that the book was dictated to him, during his honeymoon with Rose, in 1904 in the city of Cairo, Egypt. The book was dictated, in one hour, for three consecutive days by an \"entity praeterhuman\" name Aiwass. In a series of visions, Rose indicated a number of symbols associated with the Egyptian god Horus, in accordance with the system of the Golden Dawn Crowley obtained, complementing and increasing it by their own"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"investigations magical-mystical. Going to the museum Boulaq she pointed to her husband the Stele 666, which has since achieved great significance in Thelemic mythology, as the alternative form of the Book of the Law Following the instructions of Rose, Crowley, rented a hotel room, got it as invoking Horus temple and received the dictation of the Book of the Law on days 8, 9 and 10 April.The phrase \"Book of the Law\" is derived from Freemasonry, as an alternative form of \"Volume of Sacred Law\" that most of the Masonic Lodges of the World and 'the Bible (Old and New Testament). In Stores and Temples Thelemic (OTO) is used Liber AL vel Legis (The Book of the Law). The book is used in various rituals, initiation or not, the OTO andA. '. A.'. (the main Orders System ThlÃªmico). Only the A. '. A.'. is not a Masonic order, following lines purely spiritual.The Book of the Law consists of three chapters, each one dedicated to a deity reigning in Aeon. The trinity of the Book of the Law or Liber AL is comprised of three Egyptian deities:The First is NUIT (NUT), the goddess of the night sky, closely linked, in Egyptian religion, with Hathor, also known as the Egyptian Venus. His message of freedom, love and kiss mystical union, as expressed in the curious equation 0 = 2. Nuit reveals the Law of Thelema and declares that the Aeons alternated at the Equinox of the Gods. She is magically represented as space and the stars contained therein. Nuit has been interpreted as the space-time continuum, or as the infinite potential containing all things real and unreal.The second is HADIT (HERU-BEHDETI or HORUS of EDFU), the winged solar globe of divine authority. This form of the God Horus, originally in Bedheti, had great influence through ancient Egypt. Hadit symbolizes individuality secret inside each of us, the star that we are given one of the indivisible and unmanifested divine spark that moves each of us in our chosen path of self will. As such, Hadith also represents the hidden world, and the infinite small point, the capacity for knowledge, the companion of Nuit, and the fiery nature of the hidden world of the deities such as Los Blake, the Greek Hecate and Hades, Lucifer Christian . Choleric aspect is always interpreted as a form of high energy used for many purposes. Themes royals are at the center of the message of Hadit.The Third Divine Trinity this is the child born of the union of Nuit and HADIT, the Lord of the New Aeon, alternatively represented by two different forms of HORUS . One is Ra-Hoor-KHUIT (Ra-Horakhty), an aspect of Horus as military conqueror and warrior. Ra-Hoor-Khuit exudes the internal energy of Hadit the world. Anyway impulses to war and violence found in the Third Chapter of the Book of the Law, and a little less in the Second Chapter, representing a magic formula of fiery energy: current exhortations about plans for conquest of political power and time. \"Supplicant\" or false Thelemites find any literal interpretation of ordnance repugnant to their \"principles\" (crististas, of course). But Thelemites accept them as a necessary part of the transition of the world to the New Aeon.The other form of Horus in the Third Chapter is HOOR-PAAR-Kraat (Harpocrates), Horus the Son, traditionally the son of Isis and Osiris. The Hoor-Paar-Kraat was given an attribute that he probably did not have the Ancient Egyptian Religion - pressed his finger to his lips seems to be a gesture of request for silence. Thus, from the Golden Dawn, he was made the \"God of Silence,\" which appears as a mystic and important principle.However, his finger on his lips is now being considered, Egyptologists scholars, as the act of child sucking his thumb. When Crowley revised the Trump \"Judgment\" in the latter years of his life he expressed this change, making the finger on the lips of Harpocrates a gesture of childish delight in new adventures and possibilities.Reviews of The Book of the Law reveals a structure comprising three distinct categories: (1) the occult, including work Qabalistic and sexual magic formulas, (2) the philosophical, where old systems are achieving global co-reported with recent scientific concepts and (3) policy, where the sociological implications of the Law of Thelema become applicable to the situation of the contemporary world, implications that seem more urgent today than they were fifty years ago when I comment was written New The first two reviews Crowley on the Book of the Law are separated by many years. The Old I comment first appeared in \"The Equinox\" in 1912. The New I comment - he never published - was written in 1920 as the result of \"Work Cephaloedium a sex magic ritual in which the Beast (Crowley) and his Scarlet Woman (Alostrael) were assisted by Frater genesthai.\"The Working Djeridensis\" another comment upon the Book of the Law was written by Crowley in Tunis in 1923, he completed it. There are other comments of which was published in the \"Equinox of the Gods\" (1936), others do not come to us. The only comment that Crowley accepted as having been inspired by"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Hadit - as promised in the Book (Chapter three, 40) - that is received by him in Tunis (1925). It contains a notice stating that he who fails to destroy the Book of the Law after the first reading at risk of great danger.\"Bahlasti! Ompehda! I spit on your crapulous creeds\" (AL III, 54) Comment:Thelema to all faiths belonging to the Old Aeon are crapulous. The verse should be understood literally. There is no symbolism here. The sentence is clear and direct. The author of \"The Book of the Law For Supplicant\" (from now on \"Supplicant\") has not yet understood that Thelema has nothing to do with creeds mushy, soft, warm, past Aeon.The term \"spit\" is. Here, just the idea common and normal to spit in disgust, spitting what you despise, so anything having to do with the legend of the Spit \"Jesus\", described in the New Testament, by the way, is a jumble of superstitions, words political organizations to pass the time, and patches from other beliefs, etc..Every action thelemic is manly, powerful, magical, manly, etc.. The verse has no veiled message in the sense that the author of \"Supplicant\" want to give. This is deceiving, is masking the truth. Thelemites not support such behavior. Bahlasti and Ompehda are words of Enochian Language (Language Angelica), having nothing to do with the \"explanations\" given in \"Supplicant\". Quite the contrary. Bahlasti, is a powerful invocation for vengeance, and is linked to Bahti, an entity described in the \"Secret Doctrine\" of Blavatsky.Ompehda refers also revenge. Note that Om (Ma) peh (mouth) of the (earth), which can be translated as \"mouth-terrestrial Daughter\" - a private and vile insult. There is a systematic whole special pronounce the words in the Enochian language. The process is described in \"The Golden Dawn\" by Israel Regardie.***Dear Mr.93.\"A number, more and more scholars came to believe that, from the beginning, \"Thelemites\" understood in different ways, even contradictory, the message Thelemic. Almost immediately such differences have produced several \"organizations\" aggregate, respectively, around a certain Leader \"Realize at the outset that the bibliography contained in his book (\"Supplicant\") only presents a book by Crowley, ie, only one book Thelemic but cites literature 2nd and 3rd category (compilations, etc..) Including a book spiritualist. This your bibliography, we can only highlight, as representing serious esoteric work, the books of Blavatsky, Eliphas Levi and EA Wallis Budge. Although the latter already surpassed these days of Egyptology. What I mean by this? 's very simple: do you understand or know nothing about Thelemic system, or Crowley, except what was told very quickly and confusedly in his pseuda \"initiation\" in Caliphado. \"Its research sources are very poor.There is the second cover of his book (\"Supplicant\"), an appreciation about Crowley and Liber AL I consider totally out of \"real\", once again demonstrating their full ignorance regarding Crowley and his work.Crowley can never be compared with the \"hippies\" or \"beatniks\", even a slight appreciation. Crowley, Panyata my dear, is the Great Beast (To Mega Therion), the Logos of the Aeon (A MAGUS, which is the WORD Formula Aeon of Horus), nothing more and nothing less.You know what that means?In its assessment is written: \"(Crowley) However, let stern warnings about the need of magic to be experienced on austerity and moral within the principles always in accordance with the laws of Nature (the bold is mine).Here you make the same blunder committed by the leaders of the FRA. That is, moral safeguards put in the phrase \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.\" The moral that Mr. refer? The moral is rife in today's world, created by the lackeys of the Roman Church? Or morals of corny spiritualists, evangelicals,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Theosophists, etc.. Or will you approve of morality created by Jehovah, created the monster that \"speaks\" in the Old Testament one language selfish, malicious, cruel, etc.. , A monster who murdered children and ordered the rape of virgins? A God who \"repented\" of several of his actions, thus abolishing the idea that he is oniciente. A God who in a fit of rage and anger, \"tries\" to annihilate all creatures for being corrupt, forgetting they were his own creations: \"Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth ... the LORD repented you have made man on the earth ... I will remove the surface soil the men who created ... \"\"My scribe Ankh-af-na-khonsu the priest of the princes, this book will not change in a single letter, but lest there be folly, he shall comment thereupon by the wisdom of Ra - Hoor - Khuit\" (AL - I, 36)Not always the statements and views of esoteric come into line, even if they are talking about exactly the same subject, and especially when the subject is Thelema.It becomes quite difficult to say that a person is wrong in its ideas and conceptions about Thelema and any other subject. I believe, on the contrary, she was deluded, deceived, seeing the scene through a semi-transparent veil. Of course, this mistake leads to error.It arises from ignorance of certain fundamentals, certain principles camouflaged long for those who do not wish that humanity becomes aware, ie: check directly without interference from the opaque veil, and evolve beyond current status.Why?Because only then they will have power over us. The whole thing is more or less like the one shown in the film Matrix. And just as the hero (Horus) of the film, it is the duty of all serious Thelemite combat ignorance and error, and those who created them, wherever they are. I will not go into detail here about this subject. My purpose is solely to expose all my observations with respect to the book \"The Book of the Law for Supplicant\", as the author himself asked me to.At first I must say that the author of the book can not make an assessment of \"Thelemic philosophy\" simply because it does not have, even a slight but serious study of it nor the experience necessary to evaluate it, even in its most low levels, the more in their higher dimensions. This is a fact, not idle speculation. Who knows the system used by Caliphado to instruct their \"associates\", you know that I'm talking about.The Thelemic system can never be compared with any of the esoteric systems then known, because for centuries they have been used in a distorted, riddled with sentimentality, feelings and religious tendencies (especially crististas). Thelemites can never fall into this error. This must be avoided constantly, and every thought and action leading him in this direction has to be destroyed in their birthplaces, otherwise Thelema fall in the same situation of organized religions and \"initiatic orders\" related to the Black Lodge. The term should not be confused with the Black Brotherhood, which is something completely different.Know that there are three main fraternities for our planet. The Dark Brotherhood (not to be confused with the Black Lodge), the Brotherhood Yellow and White Brotherhood. In the Old Testament they are symbolized by the three sons of Noah ~ es, and in the New Testament by the Three Wise Men. We caution that there is no racist overtones, or theological, in the \"colors\" of these fraternities. So the Black Fraternity that all manifestation is necessarily of the nature of suffering, that the aim of man should be so exhausting personal and absorption of Karma Nirvana. That fraternity was the Buddha Siddhartha Gautama the greatest exponent, his canonical book was the Dhammapada.The Yellow Fraternity that every manifestation being forcibly settled up, must have reason to be, and therefore the aim of man should be plastically adapt to the conditions of manifestation friction, and never presume to modify, in a manner or other natural processes.The greatest exponent of this fraternity was Lao-Tse, and his canonical book The Book of Tao. The White Brotherhood maintains that the aim of man is to become what Blavatsky called NIRMANAKAYA, that the Great Work is the progressive transmutation, the first personal metals, after the planetary metals into gold, and finally the universal metals into gold, and the purpose and fun Adept should be to make the desert bloom in beauty and perfume. The greatest exponent of this fraternity was and is the Great Beast"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"of Revelation, and his book canonical, that is not yours, but belongs to Our Lady of the Stars, Fire Divine will and Child Solar, is the Book of the Law This presented here is a fact, but should be verified by study and practice. Verification is always individual. It is useless to \"believe\" in that - your \"faith\" that does not make you able to understand the whole system.Every religious mysticism, fajutagem all this, all this fussiness involving the esoteric (or occult) began in the Middle Ages, when the Western world plunged into darkness created and cultivated by the Church of Rome (wrongly called Christian). The leaders of it all did (and still do) to the Great Truths were hidden from men, and began to persecute the true sages and heroes who wanted to reverse the situation. This gave rise to the emergence of groups coming together secretly for the exchange of knowledge. Thus were born the Secret Orders and Fraternities, which was discussed freely and openly issues related to Real Science without fearing persecution. However, even these associations were, over time, penetrated by the enemy, starting a movement systematic destruction or distortion (and this from the inside out, thanks to the actions of traitors that have always existed) knowledge cultivated by the Initiates. It exist gaps and anomalies in all these systems, because they are fruits of distortions and adaptations, etc.., The benefit of that Damn Shop and its affiliates, that is, the Church of Rome and the Evangelical Sects, which are generated by Lie menstrua. This plan was executed for centuries.But the job destroyer ever managed to penetrate the heart of the True Teaching Initiation. Actually this Teaching has always existed in various forms and various names, getting through the centuries without being even, touched by the minions of the Black Lodge (or Great Sorcery, as others call it). It can be said that the power and dynamism of the Teaching Real (now presenting itself under the generic name of Thelema) transcends any capacity intruder who has the power to affect any other system. It is precisely this ability that keeps Thelema in its purity. For this reason, when a profane, or even some fool telling yourself started in Thelema, mete to translate or discuss one of our sacred books, that purity is threatened, and the result is that we see in our day with respect the dubious Thelemic organizations. Moreover Thelema is a sphere inside another sphere, that is, there is an organization visible and the other invisible, each with its own function not understood by the profane as much as he strives to comprehend. Unless certain passwords and keys are discovered by constant study and practice Thelemic, and the necessary internal contacts are made, this understanding will never be achieved. This is not a play on words: Let him who has ears hear.The Invisible System is far from any undue interference. Safeguards around it are automatic and accurate in its operation and, of course, respond to any intrusion attempt with the same intensity that are attacked. Till today profane curiosity did not prevent the formation of legends around Thelema, and the Thelemites mainly Crowley, partly because profane and members of other organizations still do not look for these things beyond the limits of ideology, religion and politics. Thus, Crowley remains, for future generations, which was for many in his own time: a mystery.Thelema is not a common, well known as others, even though people try to exploit it for their own benefit. But this attempt to deceive, because after all, they are the exploited ....\"The slaves shall serve.\"Faced with bankruptcy of organizations mythical and magical of all colors and origins, all the \"rays\" and \"flames\", the true masters of mankind concluded the need to safeguard the traditions and magical teachings that come up to us, continues in a succession of men ready for the mission of donating them spotless humanity. These men (or beings) are not connected to any order or fraternity, profanity or brotherhoods known, although they can use as a means to \"choose\" future candidates to assume a mission. The wise men of these organizations are free of religious ties, from any church official.Liber AL vel Legis, or Liber CCXX, was dictated to Crowley by one of these Masters.Crowley was the man who received the saying, assuming the mission to transmit it to all mankind. The book contains truths that somehow frighten those who read it the first time or who are not prepared to receive them. But the book was not meant for beggars, but to the kings of this world. It was not done to \"pleading\", but for those who command. Was not done for the poor but for the rich. Therefore it is written \"that he has, more will be added, but those who do not have, even what they have will be taken away, and so it is written, let the dead bury their dead.\"In each language alive or dead, every word was, in its origin, meaning, but over time has acquired"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"other. Why is this? On the one hand the widespread ignorance, the other for everyday use: a word may be misidentified; someone can give it a meaning wrong or inaccurate, and thus may reach a value of communication far away from its original meaning, or a rough idea. As an example we can take the word person (persona in Latin) used to identify a specimen of the human species. Originally the word meant \"mask\" (illusion), and the French language maintains an approximate meaning of the original: personne (French) means anyone. Another intriguing example is that we all use the word revelation in order to \"discover\", \"promotion\", \"show\", when in fact the word reveal means ensuring doubly (cover, hide twice - ER) that is ER + VELAR as in (Re) compete, (re) connect (hence (re) = ligiÃ£o call again), etc.. So in a way, those who wish presumptuously to the meaning \"hidden\" in the phrases and words of Liber AL vel Legis, do no more than sailing them twice.As already explained in Liber AL vel Legis is the foundation of all that system which we call Spiritual Attainment Thelema. The system was unveiled for us what is necessary and possible, the reviews THERION Himself. Liber AL vel Legis was dictated by Aiwass to Crowley on three consecutive days: 8, 9 and 10 April 1904 (hence the timing Thelemic start this years). The book was received in the city of Cairo (El Kaira - The Victorious) and proves the existence of entities praeter-human contact with men, even though Crowley has stated that Aiwass was his Holy Guardian Angel. Regardless, he is said to be one of the Secret of Humanity. This last definition is contrary to the position of Frater Achad in his later years. He had Aiwass as an entity doomed to destruction of humanity. But we must also say that, it seems, Frater Achad mad after his attempt to cross the Abyss. The truth would be known only by those who have become Masters of the Temple.The contact with Crowley Aiwass has nothing to do with mediumship. The organization took shape in the space of the room where Crowley sat down to record dictation of Law Aiwass came after an invocation of the God Horus performed by Crowley. This happened because in an astral vision, Rose, wife of Crowley, told him that Horus had commanded him to perform this ritual. The whole matter is described in all its details, in \"The Equinox of the Gods.\" Exactly why this narrative we can see that Rose was not in the room with Crowley, ruling out any suggestion that would have been she who dictated the Book, through some kind of mediumship. Claims that Rose would be a medium has no basis.People who claim this version of mediumship Rose do it because they know nothing how Magick works. Crowley always abhorred and fought against the use of mediumship. following is a brief narrative of Crowley himself about what happened.\"I got a minute before the 'temple' to be able to close the door and sit down at the stroke of noon. On the table were my pen - a fountain pen Swan - and letter-sized paper supply, eight of ten inches to typewriter. never looked back at any time.The voice of Aiwass apparently came over my left shoulder, the far corner of the room.Seemed to echo in my heart in a very strange, hard to describe. I have noticed a similar phenomenon when I'm expecting a message that can hold great hope or great fear. The voice flowed passionately as Aiwass was alert to the time limit. I wrote 65 pages of this present essay to my usual speed of composition, in about ten hours I half compared to the 3 hours 65 pages of the Book of the Law I had to run to keep pace, the MS demonstrate that easily. The voice was of deep timbre, musical, musical and expressive, its tones solemn, voluptuous, tender, burning, or whatever the appropriate mood swings in the message. There was low - perhaps a full tenor, or baritone. The pronounced English accent was not, either native or foreign; utterly provincial mannerisms or caste, so surprising, even amazing, to be heard first. I had a strong impression that the speaker was actually in the corner which seemed to be in a body of 'ethereal', transparent like a veil of gauze, or as a cloud of incense smoke.He was a tall, swarthy, in his thirties, well-coordinated, active and strong, with the face of a savage king, eyes veiled so that his gaze would not destroy what he saw. The clothing was not Arabic, suggested Assyria or Persia, but very vaguely.For a long time, Crowley, within your skepticism, questioned the book of the law in all the ways we can (he even \"lose it), allowing to validate the message. Skeptic As a researcher, I was immune to possible glamours coming from optical mystique of a partial observer and psychic deceptions. His friend Captain Fuller, narrating how was the revelation, wrote: \"... we see that the Great White Brotherhood, prepared Frater P. subtly, for more than two years of training in rationalism and indifference to D'They receive the message. Trabalbo performed so well that he refused the post for five years, despite many strange"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"evidence of the truth of it. Frater P. had even to be completely \"stripped himself\" before being able to convey the message effectively. \"Crowley himself wrote about Liber AL: \"I am sure I the beast whose number is 666, that this Third Chapter of the Book of the Law is nothing less than the authentic Word, the Word of the Aeon, the Truth about Nature at this time and on this planet. I wrote it, hating him and mocked him, secretly joyful that I could use it for myself rebelling against this most terrible task that Gods threw on my shoulders: the Cross of them, red-hot steel, which I load up my Calvary, the place of the skull, for there to be clear of its peso, only for it to be crucified on it ... \"Students realize that the more attentive Book appears under two numberings, XXXI and CCXX. The first refers to the manuscript originally received. The second refers to a revised and amended by Crowley himself, where modifications have been made, leaving the book with 220 verses. Foremost injunction for those flying to interpret or discuss Liber AL vel Legis, I comment on is written by ANKH-FN-Khonsu:\"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\" \"The study of this Book is forbidden.'s wise to destroy this copy after the first reading. Whoever pays no attention to it incurs danger and personal risk. These are the most gruesome. Those who discuss the contents of this Book are to be shunned by all. How outbreaks of pestilence. All questions of the Law are to be decided only by appeal to my writings, each for himself. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt. Love is the law, love under will \"ANKIH-FN-Khonsu This notice has created controversy since it was written memento, for how can the adept to penetrate the mysteries of the book without studying it? It is not my intention to enter into this debate, the better to let the text speak for itself. I repeat the warning in III, 42: \"Success is thy proof: argue not: no convertas: do not talk too much!\"All Thelemite that values observed this injunction. The others? \"Do what thou wilt\"Liber AL vel Legis is one of the books (libri) Thelemic considered Class A. These Libris (Class A) are those written by Frater VVVVV from October 1907, the year the A. '. A.'.was unveiled to the world. interested in Thelema As all know, the Books of the Order are selected in six class to know:Class A - Books written by Porfeta Class B - Works Study ordinary Class AB - Works composed that fall into both classes Class C - Questions paramount. Aid to the affairs of the Order Class D - Rituals and official instructions Class - Any book, etc., intended for dissemination of Thelema.The books are Class A publications Initiates of the Inner Order. Started a grade below Magister Templi should never translate these books into other languages, or try to write them down, because evidently commit major blunders. These translations, including those of Class B Books have to be Hand Initiates of the Inner Order. A layman to translate a work of Class A will have p Imprimatur of A. '. A.' .. Translations made by Initiates of certain degrees will be considered by the Order, but only if it decides that the original thinking was broadcast with sufficient fidelity and clarity. Somehow rashes lay translators and commentators of the same species, are just attempts egos of their rebellion against the hierarchy thelemic .. The egos of them know perfectly well that Thelema will lead, sooner or later, to the total destruction.Thus, seek to \"interpretations\" to Thelemic books (mainly verses of Liber AL vel Legis) to \"escape\" (that illusion!) Consider that this situation malignant. Also it is known that no mere member of the OTO, belonging to the same degree more high (IX Â°. Xth, XI Âº) is qualified to comment or annotate Therion, especially comments regarding the verses of AL. Also, none of the A. '. A.'. below grade 8 = 3? is qualified to comment. The presumption, audacity and ridiculous initiative of certain writers, to present themselves as interpreters and commentators of Liber AL vel Legis, let us all Thelemites, stunned. There are insiders who took more than five years after achieving the degree of Magister Templi, for embarking to translate books for Class A and B.Now some thoughts about \"THE BOOK OF THE LAW FOR pleading\" that from now on, I will call"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"pleading\". Also to facilitate the work transcribe some of the reviews THERION TO GOAL (Crowley) to Liber AL, notes Frater Adjuvo (Marcelo Ramos Motta) and some of my own when deemed necessary for clarity of certain passages chosen among those \"reviewed\" and \"explained\" by the author of \"Supplicant\".I know the \"goodwill\" of \"pure intentions\" and even the \"Why\" the author had to write the book. It is precisely for this reason that this record here my quick analysis. Incidentally this is not required for those endowed with some knowledge and Thelemic sense.On page 3 of \"Supplicant\" (Teachings of the Dawn), we read:\"I believe in God.\" No Thelemite believes in a God separate from the man, he is called The Great Architect of the Universe, Jehovah, etc.., Because \"there is no God but man.\"Later in this same page 3, it says: \"... should be lower die and emerge the top and be born again.\" There is this story of being \"superior\" and \"inferior being\". This logically inferred from the previous sentence \"There is no God but man.\"This \"being inferior and superior\" profane leads to large errors of perspective. The man is a unit, non-duality. It is necessary to offset the pressure opposites. \"The Body of Man differs from his Soul, for the so-called body is a portion of Soul discerned by the five senses, the main inlet of the Soul this time\" - \"Marriage of Heaven and Hell\" - engraving 4, The Voice of the Devil \"- William Blake.(This is a precept that should be studied by all who wish to follow the current Thelemic).On page 7 (Supplicant), early on found a lamentable translation into Portuguese of \"Do what thou wilt Shall be the whole of the Law\", some \"Thelemites\" (especially those \"initiated\" in Caliphado), insist, by sheer vanity, opposed to that of Marcelo Ramos Motta (Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law) which is much more elegant and \"magic\" than theirs (\"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law \"). This bad translation arose when members tried to demoralize Caliphado Marcelo Motta (Frater Parzival XI Â°) a few years ago. Unfortunately for them the translation that is closer to the original idea, expressed in the phrase in English, is to Marcelo Motta: \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\" There are some smart guys, not containing the seductions of their egos , add a comma in that sentence is: \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\"In the Preface of the book (Supplicant), page 8, we find: ... \"At the end, thank Panyatara the opportunity prefaces her and wished him success, and welcome reissue by scholars of the hermetic sciences and the Thelemites of Brazil and Latin America.\".It is said by Panyata that whoever wrote this is a Thelemite. I doubt it ...NEVER A host Thelemite A BOOK LIKE THIS, THAT IS SHOCKING THELEMA FRONT WITH THE BEGINNINGS IN YOUR TITLE. \"Supplicant\" Is THAT implore humbly. KNEELS TO ASK.Prostate BEFORE THAT SOMEONE OR SOMETHING THAT IS NOT YOUR RELIQUARY INTERNAL TO ASK. THIS IS A DISGUSTING ATTITUDE TO THE EYES OF ANY Thelemite, prostrating BECAUSE IF SO MAN HEREBY WAIVE YOUR DIVINITY AND INDIVIDUALITY.All \"pleading\" is, ultimately, a sufferer, a masochist. Suffering is the result of ignorance, and their presence is error symptom, not a sign of spiritualization, as we want to convince Catholics, spiritualists, evangelicals, etc.. Every human being who suffers, suffers for his own guilt and suffering at the moment: our mistakes of the past determine our conditions of manifestation, but the essence of our being, the inner fire burning in the heart of Fallen Star, is always present in us, is always present in us the possibility of Philosopher's Stone that transmutes the heavy, painful Lead Saturn in beautiful, bright Ruby and Gold of the SunAs for this \"story\" to help people, that is, have pity of \"pleading\" is a thing of the Black Brothers.

Moreover we can not live anyone else's life, and the most important moments in the history of a man (Birth and Death) he is alone, although it may be surrounded at the time by a mob.Sure. I will not comment any book of \"Supplicant\", I would have to write another book, and do not have time for this - \"The Christians to the lions.\" I will make some observations that I think are most needed, in order to wave to all interested parties with the basis of interpretations not aligned by the author (Panyatara) for the book, prayer, wish every way breaking strength, energy, and power emanating from Liber AL vel Legis, to think them not aligned with the precepts and pieguices crististas, or Jewish, or Muslim, etc.. (all cut from the same cloth). Anyway, with all these yellowish whining abhorred by true MenThe author of \"Supplicant\" has stated that the book has been very popular. Of course!This simply means that those who fear that Thelema Liber AL would not say what it says.Besides this amount (of attorneys of the book) does not reflect quality. \"Let my servants be few & secret: they shall rule the many and known\" (AL I, 10)PERDURABO mean \"I will endure to the end.\" But if we pay attention to the word we see that it (PERDURABO) ends with a letter \"O\" (Zero, Nothing). This magically mean the \"end\" (the word Perdurabo) had NOTHING to endure. But NOTHING is NV (Nuit). NOTHING = 50 +4 +1 +1 = 56, NV = 50 +6 = 56 56 = 5 +6 = 11, the Complete Works, ie the union of the Pentagram (Man, microcosm) with the Hexagram (\"God,\" Macrocosm).On these figures it is written:\"Divide, add, multiply, and understand\" (AL I, 25)Splitting - 6:50 = 0:12 = 0 the circumference, Nuit . = Center 1 = Unit resulting - Ra-Hoor-Khuit 2 = \"H\" Coptic, whose figure resembles the Arabic figure 2, the Breath of Life, inspired and expired.

(See \"Liber AL vel Legis reviews with To Mega Therion)As can be observed, has nothing to do with the interpretations made by Mr. Panyatara that within his vision influenced by the sexual problem from the Aeon of Osiris, leads readers to a vision that Kteis (ie the Vagina) is a symbol, or points, for the World Ashia (Ashiatico or Assihatico, in his parlance), ie Olam Qliphot. In other words he wants to say: \"Beware of these spells tied to Kteis ....So it seems to me that this man has not realized what is symbolized by the Lamen of the OTO, or the Grail, and the Magic (k) is deeply connected to the power of K (useful).Moreover seem to have forgotten that in Hebrew is written from right to left. Thus NV is written in Hebrew wn (VN). So when the verse says \"my word (not my\" password \"as translated into Supplicant) is six fifty\", it follows the sequence of letters as the word would be written in Hebrew. 's that simple? Yes! It's simple, with no unnecessary frills, whose purpose is to divert our attention from the essence of things - pure hocus-pocus.The real orgasm is actually a type of consciousness that makes us realize the continuity of existence, or non-reality of death. These achievements are a result of long periods of intense practices.In AL, I, 27 \"... sweet scent of water exuded\", corresponds to the characteristic aroma of the woman's"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"vagina ready for intercourse. This Chapter binds to the previous, from which the author of \"Supplicant\" makes the following comment: \".... This truth is even easier to see when you can be reached in his Scarlet Woman, not the object of pleasure their material senses ..... \" Likewise we have \"women sweet aroma.\" Lamen of the OTOHowever, the Scarlet Woman, the Great Whore basically represents a feminine concept: the concept of sexual freedom and action and power of women, oppressed the Aeon of Osiris and Isis of the sovereign. The characteristic of freedom is not feminist, but equal to man. This is very important and must be understood without any doubt remains. The woman has the same rights as men, even in relation to sex.In \"Reviews of LA\" by Crowley (Edited in Brazil by Marcelo Ramos Motta) we have: \"Laws against adultery are based on the idea that the woman is a property, so that mate with a married woman is to deprive her husband services it \"..... \"For us, every woman is a star. It therefore has the absolute right to travel in their own orbit.\" ... \"It should be well noted that the Great Women of History has been completely free in your love life. Sappho, Semiramis, Messalina, Cleopatra, Tai Chi, Parsiva, Clytemnestra, Helen of Troy, and in more recent Joan of Arc (the According to Shakespeare), Catherine the Great of Russia, Queen Elizabeth I of England, George Sand.Against these we can put Emily Bronte, whose sexual suppression was due to their environment and thus exploded the incredible violence of his art, in addition to the more mystical religious regular Santa Thereza and so on, the facts of whose sex lives were carefully camouflaged to serve the interests of the slave-gods. But despite this, their sexual life was intense, as the writings of these women are overloaded with sexual expression passionate and perverted, even to the point of morbidity and hallucination. Gender is the main expression of the nature of a person; great natures are sexually strong; and health of any person depend on the freedom that function \"\"You drenarÃ¡s thy blood that is thy life in the golden cup of her fornication\" (Liber Cheth, 2) What readers consider this passage, meditating on this \"golden bowl\" where our \"blood\" (which is \"life\") must be shed.\"The pleasure of dissolution\", referred to in chapter 30, refers to the death, the ultimate orgasm when man dissolves in Nuit. Likewise, the normal human orgasm when man \"dissolved\" in women.Verse 31 is very poorly translated into \"Supplicant\". The correct translation is: \"For these fools of men and their woes do not you take care of all! They feel little, what is, is balanced by weak joys: but ye are my chosen\"Fools men are gods of men. Here the word fool appears written with lowercase \"t\", when written with capital 'T' refers to those who have reached the 11th Path where is allocated the Trump 0 (The Fool) whose letter is aleph (a) (number 1), the Swastika regirante Four Arms, like the figure of our Galaxy, the source of all for us. Notice that 0 multiplied by any value always gives 0, and this will lead us to several considerations. The 11th Way, which is of particular impoirtÃ¢ncia in this Aeon, relates to the Element Air and Space.In 'pleading', the translation of verse 45 is wrong. Ali is translated: \"The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two, or rather, are nothing.\" The correct translation is: \"The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none.\" The difference is apparently small but sufficient to truncate the sense and there exists qabalah. The English word NAY translates to NO, never as \"nay.\" Who translated the word in this way knows nothing of English or is maliciously (the latter being the most viable hypothesis).Now is NOT NOTHING NUIT. Verse 46 Now let's see\"Nothing is a secret key of this law. Sixty-one the Jews call it, I call it eight, eighty, four hundred & eighteen\"Nothing in Hebrew is AIN (nya) whose numerical value is 61 (N = 50, I = 10, A = 1).Jewish Kabbalists are aware of this secret, but the understanding they have of him is partial and misleading. The author of \"Supplicant\" do not confuse AIN (NADA) with the letter AYIN (u) (which means eye - numerical value 70). The hieroglyph of AYIN as matter, lace materialized, this totally wrong, as all the listing given in \"Supplicant\" p.18. Kether is the focus of Cosmic Consciousness, and its first manifestation is LVX. AIN, which is its source, is not the absence of light Darkness but (this may sound like a fallacy, but it is not), and therefore the true"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"essence of LIGHTDo not forget that 418 = 4 +1 +8 = 13 (Achad - Unit). This reminds us that the numerical value of the Sephiroth of the Middle Pillar is 26, ie twice or 13x2 = 26. And that YHVH also has the value 26. Therefore YHVH (Jehovah) is the unit in duality.On page 65 of \"Supplicant\" found the comment about the 57 Vs I.Ch. AL: \"Call upon me under the stars! Love is the law, love under will. Nor let the fools mistake love; love because there and love. exists the pigeon, and there is the serpent. Choose ye well! He, my prophet, hath chosen, knowing the law of the fortress, and the great mystery of the House of God. All these old letters of my book are correct, but x (Tzaddi )) is not the Star. e'secreto This also: my prophet shall reveal it to the wise. \" (This is the correct translation of the verse).Before this, Crowley then reasoned: \"If the letter was not Tzaddi 'The Star', which was then Tzaddi? For years (twenty years to be exact) he tried to solve the riddle, exchanging the Charter, The Star of number XVII with others. Past this time, the solution finally came. Tzaddi is the \"Emperor.\" Therefore, the position of Letters XVII and IV must be replaced. This was quite satisfactory to him. correctness of the return is more evident when consider the etymology. \"It is natural that the Great Mother (symbolized by the letter\" A Star \"), should be assigned the letter He (h), which is his letter in the Tetragrammaton (YHVH). And, of course, is the natural Tzaddi lyrics of \"The Emperor\" in the original phonetic system, as indicated in the words Tzar, Kzar, Keiser. Caesar, and others. I refer to the student and the writer of \"Supplicant\" (if he is really interested in Thelema) to study \"The Book of Thoth\" by Aleister Crowley (there is already an issue in Portuguese, is not very good but it serves to start up in matter).Crowley says about Tzaddi: \"I see no reason not reveal the mystery of Tzaddi the wise, others will not understand my explanations. Tzaddi is the letter of the Emperor Atu IV, and He is the letter of the Star Atu XVII (decks in common, is that the Charter Tzaddi \"The Star\"). Aries and Aquarius are thus transferred, revolving on the pivot of Pisces, just as, in the Trumps VIII and XI, Leo and Libra revolve around Virgo. This last revelation makes our Tarot attributions sublimely, perfectly, completely symmetrical. \"In the translation of \"Supplicant\" there are some mistakes that lead to misinterpretation as to what is \"The Star\", because there is written \"a star.\" The deck (Tarot) used by Mr. Panyatara, have all your assignments truncated ( or better said: wrong), maybe, who knows, to hide the true assignments to the profane. This is an evil, since people are influenced by lies, taking those errors as if they were right. Either way this just \"Deck Egyptian\" is a joke, and in bad taste, say by the way. His real name is Taro Kier, and was created in 1971 in Argentina and brought to Brazil by Vieira Nelise.An analysis is needed on \"the dove and the serpent.\" The dove is the symbol of heterosexual love between man and woman, the serpent is a symbol of homosexual love between men. The author of \"Supplicant\" should be reminded here of the New Testament passage where \"Jesus\" says: \"be wise as a serpent and innocent as a dove.\" The serious student is referred to Scholion on Libver Samech (Book Four, Section J, the long note in Chapter IV of Part III of Book Four, on the Word ALIM (not to be confused with Alhim = Elohim) (see \"Magick\" pag. 157 - Samuel Weiser Inc.), the following verses 14-21 and 34-36 of Liber CCCLXX, the commentary on verse 52 of AL, especially paragraphs 39-40, and the Hymn in Liber XV.The main feature of the Black Brothers, when an Equinox of the Gods takes place, is that they are unable to understand the spiritual significance of the changes. Nor could it be otherwise, since they deliberately refuse to receive admonitions of Binah, which they interpret as messages from a \"Malignant Entity\" that you want to destroy them. (Really, Binah want to destroy them. INITIATION OF THE PRICE IS DEATH!). Therefore, they insist on using outdated formulas, try to destroy every manifestation of the new formula, refusing to accept the management or direction of those whose authority comes from the New Word, and - in short - behave like spoiled and rebellious children.We fully agree that it is difficult for a Hindu Started, for example, absorb the idea that AUM is an imperfect hieroglyph. For over ten thousand years Krishna (whose Word was AUM) - see Liber Aleph, Chapter 71 - was worshiped in India as \"the most perfect incarnation of the Deity. (Krishna was an Avatar of Vishnu, as is THERION an Avatar of Shiva.)

This expression is clear (less to \"Supplicant\"), does not refer to the celestial phenomenon but the moon physiological menstrual flow. In Daily, the operation is usually noted by the phrase \"El Rub\", an abbreviation for Elixir Rubeus - Elixir Red (note that red is the color of Kali.) The Scarlet Woman, the woman's \"Moon Juice\" because at this time a portal opens and solar-phalica the wizard fills the darkness with light.According to blood type, perhaps blood \"dragon.\"These two types of blood should not be confused. The student should be able to find the sense of this passage remembering the assertion Qabalistic blood is life, applying the knowledge that rests in the Sanctuary of the Gnosis of the Ninth Degree of OTO.

It is not advisable to write these things in terms too intelligible to the profane (Do not give pearls to pigs), since initiatives uninitiated to use is formidable arcana of Magick, represented in this passage could lead (and usually lead) to disaster more devastating and more hopeless. \" (A Started).Regarding the use of blood we read in \"The Christian Myth and the Dead Sea Scrolls\", pag. 143 - John M. Allegro - Europe-America Publications: \"The Gnostic rituals that so horrified the uninitiated (and Terapeutae Essenes), like eating semen and menstrual blood in the sacred feast of agape and the anointing of the body with ejaculated sperm, probably existed for thousands of years behind the traditional religion of the Near East.The verse provides the recipe to make up the \"Cakes of Light,\" which can only be cooked by a priestess in her scarlet phase.

Those who realize this \"intersection\" is the connoisseur (knowers): In English \"Thou shalt know,\" thou shalt know or Set (Set thou shalt know) - Thou = Tau = Sep.X is the ordeal, so that the ordeal whereby the candidadto is identified internally Shaitan and Osiris. This also explains, in part, because the Ancient Mysteries, Osiris was known as the black God. This Ordalia was kept secret because of the sexual nature of the intersection, which was committed between the Beast and the Scarlet Woman. need to remember that the Thelemic system is a web whose strands bind to several points.

Categorically establishes that all Gods and all men deified by legend, that humanity adopts are fools. This means, in a sense, they reached the level of consciousness of the Fool of the Tarot. In another sense, it means that they are fools in the pejorative sense of the word, because he loves to do. The fact that they have become sufficiently well known to be worshiped is proof of their folly. See LIBER MAGI up to better understanding of the subject. (Marcelo Motta)\"The verse makes a clear distinction between the Gods - using uppercase D - and men. Gods crossed the Abyss, and being known must have achieved the grade of Magus. Males are the Black Brothers, who deliberately make love to raise slaves. Magus must act, though he does not like. Brothers Blacks should shut up (to achieve Binah) - but not enjoy. Magus fulfills the Law, the Black Brothers rebel against it ......

Means also that the God-idea should be thrown, with other relics of fear born of ignorance, the rubbish heap of savagery. I refer here to the idea God- as it is generally understood, \"God\" being \"something NOT OURSELVES that impels us to righteousness\" \"And this is the horror that was shown near the lake near the City of the Seven Hills, and this is the mystery of the great prophets who came to mankind, Moses, Buddha, and Lao Tan, and Krishna, and Jesus, and Osiris, and Mohammed, for all these attained the grade of Magus, and therefore were bound by the curse of Thoth. But, being guardians of the truth, they just taught falsehood, except to those who understood, because the truth can not pass the Gate of the Abyss.But the reflection of truth has been shown in the lower Sephiroth. And its balance is in beauty, and therefore those who sought only beauty have come closer to the truth. For the Beauty receives directly three rays from above, and the other no more than one.

Will be the same women who will destroy this egregore, not men, since it was his own sense of guilt of men, their selfishness, and their cowardice, which originally forced the woman to swear herself, and thus degraded in their own their eyes, and on them.It is of paramount importance that all who want to have a minimum of notion about the Thelemic system read (and study) the comments of the Therion Liber AL vel Legis.Without this reading (added to other readings of various MMs. Belonging to the Curriculum Thelema) can not be an understanding of the system, no matter how small. \"This consensus should also be studied \"The Magical and Philosophical Reviews About the Book of the Law\" - Crowley. Note - In terms of occult teaching takes away the pleasure of the person \"taught\" figure things out for herself. Feeling that exist in the context greater than personal discovery.On page 22 of \"Supplicant\" the author suggests that Hadit is a mantra. This is totally wrong Hadit is the name of the second person of the trinity thelemic: Nuit Had (or Hadith), and Ra-Hoor-Khuit.Had NU hides (see AL, II, 1) because He is Everywhere in the Infinite, and She manifests the same reason. Every guy expresses whole, and the whole hides Guy. Hadith is infinite concentration.The particle IT in Hadith (and Nuit) is also in Thelemites. In IT we yod (y) numerical value 10, and teth (f) numeric value 9. At first letter corresponds to the Trump \"The Hermit\" and the second the Trump \"Luxuria\" (IX and XI).Nine Eleven and Graus represent the most important of the OTO. As Fr Sinn tells us: \"Iod is the point, ie ..... Had Teth in turn corresponds to the ATU XI which is a representation of BABALON.The sum of the numerical value of the two letters gives: 10 +9 = 19 which is the Atu XIX, the SOL, which represents Heru-ra-ha, the Lord of the New Aeon in his manifestation to the race of men. \"The letter itself symbolizes (see Taro Crowley) expansion of the idea of the Rose and Cross.

This is one of the many keys contained in Liber AL vel Legis, but only \"found\" when the text is read in English.Through this we can also see that the \"I am\" of Liber AL has nothing to do with the \"I Am\" invented by the masters of the System of the \"Violet Flame\" or something that has eluded so many."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"In Vs 19 of Chapter II, the author of \"Supplicant\" (p. 87) applies to the sayings of their prejudices Vs esoteric Aeon of Osiris.19. \"Is a God to live in a dog?

It is also noted that \"the dog\" was one of the names given to the \"Devil\" in the Middle Ages. verse therefore has many subtle and technical meanings., depend for their understanding, the degree of readerThe overall meaning, however, is that described by Crowley with the addition that \"dog\" is \"God\" inverted. Men and women called \"dogs\" are, therefore, who are working with their polarities reversed - that are functioning as animals rather than \"landlords\". This is, by the way, in case anyone who reveres a \"God\" external to itself, rather than an inner God (any God). should be noted here that the work of a Magus is refracted in the minds of their similar many diverse forms. One of the \"lies\" outputs of this truth is that certain pseudo-initiates boquejam around, like a big secret that the \"seat of the Rosicrucian Fraternity is on Sirius!\"! (Sirius is the star of apparent magnitude higher in the southern sky, and is in the constellation Canis Major). It is, to quote Crowley, as if anyone would believe that a cat is the animal trained to put the letters G, A, T, O, in that order.The materialization of symbols is always the first step to the Church of Rome ... syllogism is a masterpiece of \"Ã  la Reason Why\": We do not like the Book of the Law, the Book of the Law speaks ill of the dogs, so the true seat of Rosicrucian Fraternity is on Sirius.Let us now consider the masterpiece of thought and riddled uninitiated prejudices crististas.Liber AL II, 21 (right translation):\"We have nothing with the incapable and kicked: let them die in their misery. For they feel not. Compassion is the vice of kings: shod feet to the wretched and the weak: this is the law of the strong: this is our law and joy in the world. Think not, o king, that lie: That thou must die: verily thou shalt not die, but live. now be it understood: if the body of the King dissolve, he shall remain in pure Ãªxatase forever. Nuit! Hadir! Ra-Hoor-Khuit! The Sun, Strength & Sight, Light; these are for the servants of the Star & the Snake.The comments of Mr. Panyata have nothing to do with the record in the Vs Your comments become a major disinformation, and is condoning pieguismo cristista ..\"The verse should be read in connection with verse 5, it refers to the Black Brothers, that is, incapable and expelled. Should be noted, however, that there is a difference.\" Incapable \"are those that absorb hand Spiritual Message of the Law of Thelema, nor could conceive it. \"Expelled\" are those who try, but fail. Revenue is simple: We have nothing with them. We should not talk to them, or try to comfort them, nor try to help them. \"We have nothing with them.\" But NOTHING is Nuit. Consequently \"let them die in their mise'ria\". \"For they feel not\" That is, they FEEL \"NO\" to die - Hadit\"The Black Brothers is characterized by two main symptoms.

What he is saying when he says: \"Pity the poor\" is actually Pity Me.The only recipe for a Black Brother that crosses our path is flatten it and destroy it.\"Because he does not feel.\" So shod feet the wretched & the weak. This does not mean the proletariat shod feet. The proletariat has amply proved that nobody tread down with impunity. And if someone calcasse feet with impunity - why, then he deserves to be trampled - and continue to trample him to death or lift (in either case he will rise. 'Cause they \"do not\" feel - and reborn more conscious of their true Will - HaditRegarding the \"strange drugs\" AL, II, 22 see (and study) Liber Aleph. Mr. Panyatara again outlet me with his \"innocence\" cristista commenting that \"wedding at Cana, where\" Jesus \"turns water into wine, must be interpreted as an allegory about Apas (water) and Tejas (Wine). A wedding at Cana are literally the marriage of ADEPT, known as Jesus and his bride, Maria Magdalena. And the transformation of water into wine relates to the Ritual of the Ninth Degree.In AL II vs the 23. refers to the spiritual experience of identity. It has nothing to do with this nonsense of \"I AM\". It is impossible to understand the nature of Hadit, repeat, if the student has not experienced any activity involving trance Ajna. \"Friends\" of Hadit are growers Hadith: the \"hermits\" are the Masters of the Temple (See Liber VII, vii, 28-34).On the other hand U.S. is ANI in Hebrew, and the word with the same numerical value is AIN, ie NOTHING.For another example of \"paranomasia\" (kind of pun) and wordplay have in AL III, 16 (In English) \"Ye, even ye, know not all thid meaning\" (\"Ye, even ye, know not this meaning all \". (Note how the peculiar grammar suggests a hidden meaning.) Now ye are in Hebrew YH, man and woman, and the Beast Babalon, whom God is addressing this verse;\" KNOW \"suggests\" NO \"Giving LA, 31;\" not \"is LA, 31, again at current meaning, and\" ALL \"(all around) refers to AL, 31 again (Again, ALL is 61, AIN , \"nothing.\"More attentive readers should realize that the Book of the Law the conjunction \"and` \"(and in English) is written in certain VS. in its \"&\". This certainly suggests something important)Nia CophThe Vrs. Chapter three 72 was in \"Supplicant\" translated as follows:\"I AM the Lord of the Double Wand of Power; bat Force Coph Nia - but my mother is left empty, for I have crushed an Universe; nothing left\"This translation is completely wrong and has certain inventions of the author in its spelling.Early on we found I AM (capital letters) and then the personal pronoun of the first person also capitalized. It is the clearest demonstration that the author of \"Supplicant\" is strongly obsessed by his ego. Note that in Vs 54 of Chapter I there is a serious warning about this:\"Change not as much the style of a letter ....\"At the foot of page runs. 186, the Sr.Panyatara makes two observations: one about why he translated the word \"Wand\" as a club, the other concerning the Word Coph Nia. The two observations say nothing useful.\"The Double Wand of Power\" is a curious variant of \"Double Wand of Power.\" The general meaning dissosendo: \"I also control forces and payables. To take up this\" control \"is not necessary\" bat \", a small Wand serves. Power is not directly proportional to the size of the magical instrument. Most Magicians are often the instruments have small, but used wisely. A correct translation is: \"I am the Lord of the Double Wand of Power, the wand of the Force Coph Nia - but my mother is left empty, for I have crushed an Universe; & there is nothing left. \"(here we see again the use of the conjunction in form &)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"This is the 72nd verse of the last chapter of AL, and the 217th verse of the Book as a whole. The two numbers, 72 and 217, indicating the nature of the Force mentioned. 72 is the number of OB, the Serpent (Aub), the feminine or negative aspect fr OD (Aud) which is the very Light Magic, is also the number of the word Chaldean DBIVN, which means flow or \"drop of blood.\" 72 + 217 = 289, the number of PTR one \"opening\", \"hole\", or \"empty\". All these ideas suggested by the verse number can therefore be summarized by the symbol of the womb and its \"emanations ofÃ­dicas. This is confirmed by the curious word, or name, Nia Coph. Coph or Koph means\" daughter \"(See\" Ancient Art and Mythology \"by Richard Payne Knights, Section 117, Koph..) is a name of Proserpine or Persephone, the goddess of destruction.The second part of the name or word - Nia - is AIN (Nothing) instead, which identifies the Uterus Eye or daughter with the Ob or Current Serpentine, a \"double-wanded\" because Obama is the complement of Od. \"The mother is left empty,\" because I (ego) crushed an Universe & nothing (ain) left. \"Ain is 61; Nia is also 61, but if the name is also on the contrary, we get 16, and 16 is Hia (She), ie, the Daughter. 16 is the square of 4, and Liber CCXXXI the fourth verse, which is numbered 3, states: \"The Virgin of God is enthroned upon an oyster shell, she is like a pearl ..... In his heart is Hadit the invisible glory. \"Ending these notes I want, again, alert the Sr.Panyatara the 'I AM' in any verse of Liber AL vel Legis has nothing to do with the well recognized \"I Am\" on the system of 'Violet Flame' or any other equivalent. The Thelemic system has nothing to do with egos inflamed.Consider, in passing, the last Vs (66) of Chapter I:\"The Manifestation of Nuit is at an end\" The correct translation is: \"The Manifestation of Nuit is at an end\", and not, as one would expect \"The Manifestation of Nuit is at an end\" Here, Fr Achad connected the two ends word (Ma) nifestat (ion), obtaining Ion Ma, ie: The Ion (Aeon) Ma (Maat). Hence Achad developed an entire structure on Liber AL vel Legis.The Vs 41 of Chapter three (\"stablish at thy Kaaba a clerk-house: all must be done well and with business way\") as follows: \"Establish at thy Kaaba sacristy one: all must be done well and with normal course \"Adds a note explaining his translation (sacristy) for lack of a better term, in Portuguese, for clerk-house. Evidently the Sr.Panyatara not understand \"bulhufas\" compared to 41 Vs, aliii. The correct translation is: \"Establish at thy Kaaba a clerk, all must be done well and with business way.\" Sr.Panyata If you were not so blinded by cristismo, he would have paid more attention to who speaks Vs openly \"camuflarmos our Kaaba like a home business. had also searched in the dictionary, you would see that the term clerk translates as clerk, office clerk, clerk, bookkeeper, etc.. (See\" New Dictionary Barsa the English and Portuguese languages, \"pg.111. ClÃ©rico in English cleric is (quite different from clerk). failures are like this, for me, invalidate every book Mr. Panyata, and demonstrate their tendencies (unconscious, perhaps) against Liber AL vel Legis.Particularly in this Vs Mr. Panyata indicates, very subtly, that Crowley had misunderstood the word, and scratching it, replaced it with another. It's amazing how the human mind works. It's amazing how a person who says \"started\" is handled by egregore Brothers know that you provided your initiation to the Sanctuary of the Gnosis. The word was scratched by Crowley 'clerkship' (clerk) replaced by a more appropriate word 'clerkhouse' (office).Chapter II, 68 \"Hardens! Saves you plumb! Lift up your head!, Not breath so deep - die! who does not understand the relation VS. A'Ash see Liber.

(Here the reader can take several considerations regarding the characteristics of each one.)Magnificent beasts of women with large limbs, and fire and light in their eyes, and masses of flaming hair about them, that is exactly what is written. Here there is no reference to minimum 'phalanxes of beings belonging to another line of evolution'. In \"Magical Diary of the Beast 666,\" Crowley describes these women with whom he practiced sexual magic.\"Fire and light in their eyes\" refers particularly to this type of woman libido. Reading the \"comments\" Mr. Panyatara can assess the size of Christian hypocrisy. They feel hot for this kind of woman (usually professional prostitutes) but they fear the public and become \"hermits\" within the meaning of the word wrong.Chapter three, vs. 73\"Cole slides from right to left and top to bottom: then see!This refers to the blades (Letters) Taro, and is an allusion to the cryptic scheme Sephirothic Tree. The application of this procedure allows us to obtain the correct place at Trump. However, for this process to be successful, it is necessary to note that each Sephira is active in respect of the following or the following. (See Fr Sinn \"The Tree Rectified\")There are a huge number of observations that make the book of Mr. Panyata (\"The Book of the Law for Supplicant) a bundle of prejudices crististas, mistranslations, personal antagonism to Crowley and, therefore, no real value for thelemitas.Para others it is a center of conscious or unconscious misinformation about Thelema, Therion, etc..I would now like to make a small remembrance of certain points made here.The original English is: \"Ye, even ye, know not this meaning all.\" The paronomasia is untranslatable into any details written by Aleister Crowley. For this reason and others which better be a translation of the Book of the Law the original should always be published with the translation of the Book and the student will do well to learn the English language with such perfection as you can.Know - you know, the - no. Another pun impossible to translate. The sounds of know and are identical in English, despite the different spelling. , and Not On, negative English, may be translated into Portuguese by the same word \"no\" or by entering negative expressions as \"no\", \"no one , \"etc..All can be translated into Portuguese as \"all\", \"all\" or \"all\" - the adjective in English are invariable. Now \"all\" or \"all\" in Greek is PAN - Pan, the \"Devil\" Lucifer. Whenever this appears pun tried pouring it into Portuguese in order to remain as faithful as possible to the intent of the original.ALL = Aleph + Lamed Lamed + = 1 +30 +30 = 61. In Hebrew Nothing too e'61. The Greeks said that PÃ view was to die, die out, be annihilated. Note that Nirvana and Nirvana is precisely this: Yoga and Buddhism tend to the same objective. Pan is Nuit Herself. The reader should not allow the confusion of the intellect; these ideas are above the Abyss, consequently contain contradictions within themselves. Only experience will initiatory understanding - lucubrations intlectuais be completely sterile. (See \"Equinox of the Gods in Brazil\", and Liber LXV, v, 59)Another interesting point is not to forget that, in English, are marked with a decimal point, not a comma, like so: 12:12Set or Satan shall be placed before the old gods because He is the oldest of the Gods: Lucifer is the Firstborn of the Father, the Port Light, the Word.In the original version, \"Why\" is Because Qabalistic whose value is 29, the sum of the letters of Qabalistic Hadit is also 29. \"Because,\" thus indicates a false divine identity, external, which can be taken by the unwary for real, internal, Hadit. \"Why\" is because the \"Image Paterna\" psychoanalysts. The fact that \"Why\" is a word linked to the process of reasoning indicates that the Image Paterna exists solely in the mind, ie, the Manas, the Mental Plane. There above the Abyss. It is a form of Maya, illusion.Some do not understand why Marcelo Motta TO ME translated as \"The ME\". Transliteration \"TO MH\" (TO ME) can be accepted as the \"signature\" of Nuit, identifying A as the speaker, because these Greek words"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"meaning \"The No\", which is the Name It. This Gematria of TO MH can be admitted as a further confirmation, because the sum of the letters, 418, is manifested in other parts of Liber AL vel Legis as the number of Aeon.This \"To Me\" is another example of the need for serious student know the English language (not to mention Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew!.) The most we could do was to keep the translation in \"me\", MH, \" not \"in Greek. \"Me,\" of course, is a Portuguese archaic form of \"I\"BAPHOMETLittle will be said here about Baphomet because of the complexity of the subject.BaphometI invoke Thee, Baphomet, Tu Union of Opposites in Infinity!

Bring Force My Name!The Force lives in my altars! Baphomet, the \"god\" of the Templars. Baphomet or Goat of Mendes is NOT a Christian figure of the Devil. It is a symbolic representation of the pantheistic god that is the sum total of everything in the Universe or PAN. Symbolically, the Horns represent \"Antennas\" in unmanifested Source of Power and are symbols of the Ancient Mysteries. The Goat is the beast (or animal) symbolizing regeneration and therefore Goathead with \"horn central fig\" is the Light of Wisdom and Regeneration achieved through the \"awakening\" of the Kundalini, or \"Power of the Dragon\" in the human body . Kundalini or Serpent of Fire is also represented by the caduceus Grand Old Man of the Qabalah, also represents timelessness and immutability.The pentagram on the forehead with the point upwards symbolizes the material elements and senses are dominated by Spiritual Light .. Crescent and Crescent Moons, arms, represent the power to create and dissolve, and life and death as reflected in the material world. But there is also a very special symbolism attached to certain sexual rituals.The arms mean Chesed (Mercy) and Geburah (Severity) in perfect balance on the Tree of Life. So the Torch Light forehead represents Kether, the tip of each horn Binah (Understanding) and Chesed (Saabedoria). In the center of the chest that Tiphareth (Beauty), represented in some figures for a \"Rosicrucian\". The Caduceus is, of course, Yesod (Foundation) and every knee Netzch (Splendor) and Hod (Victory). Note that an arm, the other male and female. Has a woman's breast and a \"chest\" of man. This symbolizes the status of the androgynous deity and the human soul. In this sense it is easy to understand why some report that the name Baphomet comes from three abbreviations spelled in reverse: TEM.OHP.AB (\"Templi Omnium Hominum Pacis Abbas\") meaning: The Father of the Temple of Peace to all men \". Crowley, however, wrote that the name should be spelled as follows: BAPHOMEThR, referring to \"Father Mithras\", being a god Mithras pahlica-solar energy.Writing the word Baphomet in Hebrew and recalling that the Hebrew letters are read from left to right are: tmwpbtau - men - ford - Standing - beth"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Applying the rules of atbash have:aypwcphe aleph-yod-shin-vau- Although written in Hebrew reads (SVPhIA - Sophia) Greek for Wisdom.
