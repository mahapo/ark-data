[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"(Thelemic TextsIntroductionIn June 1973, Frater Parsifal sent me Patent OTO for jobs in the First Three Degrees of the Order in Brazil. Our initial project would form a group of eleven people (men and women) interested in founding a Lodge. At the time it was also our intention to publish several works of Aleister Crowley, designed to fill the gap in our country, on the subject.The project was a successful bet. We as inspiration strength, Beauty, Freedom and Love of Thelema. However, certain events changed the course of our plans. Before we dive deep into the topic, we need to address certain considerations. 'm no Master, nor a mage, let alone an Initiate in the style that many individuals present themselves publicly. Do not make it rain, do not show the way to heaven, do not send anyone to hell, much less teaching earned money without working or earning your neighbor's wife. I'm just a man like all others who walk the face of the planet in search of self-realization.The notion of \"Master\" in our system, presents completely different, and even contrary to that of many others, and for us, the clearest demonstration of the lack of truth - the notion of \"Master\" of other systems is the biggest barrier erected between us and Understanding Ourselves. So keep up the \"hierarchies\" about Saber. The true Master is in ourselves, and only \"appears\" when you're really ready, that is when we (\"I\") disappear.The Master is not a \"person\" outside of us. The Master should be sought \"within\" and not \"outside\" of ourselves. The Master is the true self The Real Silver Star (Silver Star). Our own Holy Guardian Angel.Both the OTO as the A. '. A.'. Instructors have only, that is, those who are our neighbors a bit ahead in Walk. The idea of a \"Master\" external addictive, and so it is written that \"Every man and every woman is a star.\" Instructor only urges his smaller brothers to follow their own orbits personal, like stars that are in heaven Nuit.In all of the issues that will be addressed here, include main topics: 1. The probable origins of the Ordo Templi Orientis; 2. The development of order in our country; 3. An analysis of the Ancient Rituals; 4. The question of the various branches of the Order, including the one created by Marcelo Ramos Motta in our country; 5. The reality about current self appointed His eyes are (External Head of the Order) 6. Other topics of general interest.The first topic is undoubtedly the most difficult to be addressed. Due to the complexity and large amount of data found, but mostly untrue and conflicting, it is not difficult to get lost in the midst of pure speculation as to taste or sensationalist writers manipulating and using those untruths in bad faith in order to give support to their beliefs cultivated by their \"superiors hieráquicos\" using OTO for their personal interests, whether political or financial.The second topic becomes more accessible to everyone, because there is a reliable documentation, and somehow later. But anyway you need the greatest care, because here there are also handlers documents in question itself.With the third will not have problems because the rituals to which we refer (both original Reuss as the reformulated) have been published in full, we are left with only examines them under the lights of the New AgeThe fourth topic is the consequence of the latter, and is inseparably connected to it for obvious reasons. It contains the key to greater understanding of past events and hence the current. They are interconnected and, like it or not, are part of the dynamic history of the OTO.The fifth concludes the set we set ourselves develop. Offers the reader a broad overview of the reasons for all the problems that occurred, and poorly resolved within the Order, whether abroad and in our country, and its current consequences after the events from 1962."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Here we already have enough to all who wish to reflect on the subject. But this work is a simple test, but those without major pretensions of correctly - an attempt summarized the study of all these issues, you too can be in the future, added in that new data still held \"sub rosa\" come to light. As a secondary objective, the work pay will demonstrate how the OTO Thelemic system and have been misunderstood, even by \"occult\" inserted therein, and because the OTO suffered many tribulations in our country, especially in periods between the years 1962 to 1975 and from 1976 to 1995 and beyond.But do not say that is the only truth. No! Gaps in this essay are numerous to take as a complete and final presentation of the total issue. One has to also take into account the personal tendencies of the essayist. The work should be seen as an introduction - a group of more or less related tips and information to be studied and which we hope can serve any practical use to the students, not only those of Thelema but also those others belonging to other chains thought. Everyone, without any restrictions, make the following suggestion: everything that does not have practical use and not show some consistency, it will become disposable. However, we all approach the work with open minds, serene and devoid of prejudices, and with full freedom of judgment, especially towards the events in the years 1974 and 1975, about which there have been many discussions, many sensitivities, evils understood, but few efforts towards a solution definitively ending the barriers separating the various branches of the Order, arose here and there to taste preferences.The recent times have been fruitful in providing opportunities to observe, perplexed, how far you can go ignorance, ill-will, confusion, our mistakes, and isolation infertile generated by the empire of the ego. Not enough that we have witnessed aggression between the various \"clans\" formed around individuals linked previously to this or that leader, some of which are now deceased. Indeed, all this time lost in endless and fruitless harangues in wear free energy could be used more intelligently to the noblest causes in favor of proper disclosure of Thelema and strengthening of an OTO with one body.As the lights dying this century, we see the need to urgently establish a clear and accurate reassessment of our position as the OTO Initiates, in relation to Esotericism and religion, as we know today, ending the practice of those opportunistic, if using it for personal gain, have desecrated the most ignoble way. Only armed with great courage and determination and deep insight, we can end all this mystification irresponsible, criminal, we turned the Sacramental Wine.One of the roles of all OTO is exactly combat this ignorance.I can not lean me against those whose minds have not proven to be ready to understand the mysteries of the Light and Order and the Real Condition of the Divine Man. Yes!Because man is God uttermost. I can not lean me against those who tried to turn the Order dm \"dis-order\", allying themselves with other chains clearly antagonistic to the Law Of incisively true facts must be said openly, without shame or personal considerations or groups for all to see in every detail. As said by Blavatsky \"is the secret enemy of truth\"Both Crowley as his predecessors had the vision of this truth, and many of his writings are based on it.Laziness, or malice or lack of vision, or indifference, or by personal interests placed above the law, seeing, doing nothing, the most absurd events of undermining the integrity of the Order - offending the dignity of man - in his external manifestation: unholy alliances, grafts doctrines that have nothing to do with Thelema; false leaders self-styling himself \"attached\" to the larger order; unions with the lowest magic practices, spiritism, witchcraft, etc.. etc.. - A smorgasbord worthy of psychopaths.Even at such a chaotic situation, some \"initiated\" into the OTO continue advocating such miseries, as if they were examples of modernity, of progress and change. Change is always needed and welcome to the Evolutionary Chain, but such change. The change proposed by Crowley did not include attempting to degeneration of Law Thelema nor unholy alliances. This is not change, but chaos, the mess, the dis-order, pure and simple submission of weaklings.Thelemic texts - Chapter I\"This movement of\" opening esoteric, especially with regard to the initiatory schools, has been almost without exception a refinement in bad faith \""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" For over half a century, the Magician, poet, mountaineer and writer Aleister Crowley (also known as Master Therion) has exerted profound fascination and great influence in the field of Modern Occultism.Unfortunately this fascination and influence is not based specifically on the magnificent work of the Magician, but the sensational news involving the personality of Crowley, and the infamies he suffered throughout his life, and which continues to this day, forty-eight years after his physical death. Crowley was hated and persecuted by both the Roman Church and by its branches, and many other \"organizations\" (religious or not) subjugated to the Aeon of Osiris. This hatred, of course, derived from Crowley posiçãode against all the wiles and lies used by religions and political in the sense of keeping the spiritual and material power over the masses.In Brazil, the panorama is revealed pretty chaotic in this sense. What little knowledge we have of Crowley and his vast literary work (between tales, poems and esoteric practices), have been reported by people and organizations the most unable to work. There is an almost total absence of serious and well-founded esoteric literature deserves to be read, particularly tangential to recent esoteric movements revived in Europe and America.Unfortunately, the very Thelemic system, initiated by Crowley in 1904, to get AIWAZ, Liber AL vel Legis, was totally misrepresented in our midst by pseudo Thelemites.Thus, Crowley became a great riddle for us, or better: Crowley is seen as a distorted and sinister character, to the point that many have taken it as the Great Black Magician and Satanist of the worst kind, just as were once the HP Blavatsky, Eliphas Levi, and he became known by the formula Adept synthesized in the name \"YHESHUAH\".Of course, this view is a diabolical picture painted by the enemies of Thelema, and has been adopted as unquestioned truth by ignorant and malicious.References to the works of Crowley, coming to us, are made up of fragments (specially chosen) of his works mistranslated, misinterpreted and misrepresented by pseudo-esoteric formed mostly by elements linked to the Osirian Current antagonize, or graduates Thelemic Order which these have strayed incompetence or lack spiritual evolution, for example, is the case of a very known \"writer\" of esoteric works.I mean: we know Crowley and Thelêmcio System only through the distorted and one-sided view (or should I say blindness?) Of his detractors. It would not be necessary, therefore, to possess great intelligence to realize that the gap left disfigured this point of view has led us to a vision blinded System and its initiator. Thus, the same phenomenon occurred in the disclosure of the OTO which Crowley was the great reformer and Grand Master (Baphometh XI º), for years, until his death in 1947. Will mainly be on this order and its history (both in Brazil and in other countries) will deal with this assay.Many will question the work mainly Brothers from other branches of the Order existing in Brazil and around the world. It will, among other things, I'll be disclosing \"secrets\" (Blavatsky said that the secret is the enemy of truth?) And \"influencing people\", with the revelations contained herein. Actually, it does not matter. First, I clarify that there is no such the \"secrets\" as happening out there, in the sense understood by the vulgar. What exists are individuals unable to see themselves an inch before their noses. And no matter what you tell them certain facts, self-evident, they will never understand the. Second, just to embromações. They increasingly complicate the lives of embromados and embromadores, and of our bisque. Third: just a little thought and common sense to raise serious doubts about this \"Thelemic\" rule of \"no influence\" - a precept, which I understand, does not, and never did, part of our teachings, and it contains in itself, a fallacy, because, in fact, from the moment we are born, our personal influence is present on a number of people, starting with our parents, close relatives and the society around us, etc.. etc.. Perhaps, the only way to end such an influence (which works in two opposite directions, you influences and is influenced) would we withdraw, while alive, to total isolation in some cave located elsewhere in inaccessible mountain in the ends of the earth, and terribly difficult to climb.However, anyway - and no doubt it - the trick would not give the desired result, since there is no lack stupid to question why \"hidden\" for such a retreat from the world. In fact, some \"esoteric theories\" or \"mystical\" would be produced by super impressionable minds and dogmatic, and it is likely that many of these bigoted morons, those possessed, we imitate without blinking, and would start for these mountains, which would create a great commotion. So therefore, directly or indirectly, would be influenced when our original intent was just the opposite. Room: was thinking of Crowley not influence their ideas with their peers in order to show them truths or at least give them subsidies to find them for themselves, he, I am absolutely sure, never write books or said something thing and, much less, initiate a movement"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"mystical-magical. citing People constantly such a principle (not the influence), pseudamente Thelemic principles, heard the rooster crow but do not know where ... The problem, analyzing it carefully presents insoluble, and is reduced to two opposite types of action: or We influence and are influenced. There is no other way out.Paradoxically, many of which misticóides certainly criticize my work, betray themselves, defending the principle ... and publish books, texts, give lectures \"enlightening\" about Thelema, and expose their points of view because they influence ... But if this attitude is not influence, then, I confess, I do not know the meaning of the term. As I do not share with such idiocy, which I can not explain, nor conceive how did I prefer influence with the truth, than to be influenced by the lie. The only difference between the type of influence exerted by these people and that for me is that I influence people to seek the truth for themselves, while others want to influence and even instill forcibly into our minds lies of them, dressed as truths.Another example of this lack of initiatory knowledge - and highly dangerous, magically speaking - is the use of subliminal means for people to condicionarmos our prejudices, whether religious or any other nature.Once one of these pseudo started by telling yourself Thelemite, used (to impress unwary), partner not prepared in tantric rituals, because like all real Thelemite not known, partner for such rites (especially the Gnostic Mass, and of course, in the consecration shops and temples) must be intact Virgo, or consecrated prostitute. The result of this demonstration of lack of magical knowledge was immediate, and the group headed by that fool broke in less than a month in a very painful for everyone. The hidden meaning in the two descriptions is a collection of members of the IX.Advancement in Knowledge for Effective Real Science becomes necessary to obtain the \"Keys\" of these codes, without which no door will open, or will open a door wrong. And of course, this is the reason of hearing himself talk so much nonsense about the Thelemic system and Crowley.From the most remote ages, Initiates and Wizards of diverse cultures serve this code to communicate with each other. The aim of this being, of course, protect the profane try to manipulate energies totally out of your control and knowledge. Call profane to those not prepared properly or not \"awake\" or \"mature\" to use up profitably and safely (for yourself and others), of certain knowledge.Ignoring this Golden Rule, or try to interpret the coded language of initiation in light of alleged knowledge, transform Gold in Drinking Water Toffana, which certainly will lead to the ignorant and his followers to painful consequences. So take careOn January 11, 1994, I began this essay. During his writing countless memories came to mind. Recollections of events and experiences extremely important for a clear understanding of the historical Thelemic Movement in Brazil. For a while I was reluctant to record these events and experiences. However, on the other hand, I found that if I did not, my work would be incomplete. Much flee the understanding of readers outside the circles of the Order.As with the vast majority of esoteric organizations, which are not known, or at least clearly enough, accurate and consistent historical data, it checks with the OTO, or MMM.Because the existence of numerous \"stories\" and legends conflicting, makes it impossible to mining truth.On the other hand, it is true, is publicly available a huge amount of references and citations to the Order, but the majority of them being distorted, fanciful speculations in clarifying nothing major doubts about it - quite the opposite, leading us to further confusion.I can guarantee that all this tangle of quotes and legends are purposeful. Involve the history of the Order as a layer of dirt, only serving to deflect genuine seekers of the most important issues. Of course, not unaware they had also \"veils\" on specific points of the history of the Order. This veil, unlike the aforementioned dirt, were not created by evil members of the Black Lodge, and tied to the deep and real meaning in the context Dela initiatory current and should not be exposed, clearly, to the profane. Some of these veils bind directly to the \"names\" by which the Ordo Templi Orientis became known in the outside world.It is known that no legitimate order started initiatory unveils his \"Real Name\" publicly. So she uses automatic safeguards against those who are close to Dela possessed by evil intentions, or purely driven by curiosity. This is based on the magical tradition that if you know the true name of a being (whatever) you will have magical power over him.In our specific case, both name Ordo Templi Orientis as Mysteria Mystica Maxima, or simply the initials of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"these \"names\" have deep hidden meaning, only revealed to, or understood by, Initiates from grade in our hierarchy. This meaning evolves in which the initiate climbs higher rungs in his \"career initiatory\".Understand the readers that the names of orders related to the legitimate spiritual currents, such as the names of \"gods\", \"angels\", \"demons\", etc.., Express Qabalistic formulas defining veras them and their natures, and obviously these \" natures \"will only be understood (or rather\" experienced \") by Initiates in due season. In the particular case of \"angelic entities\" or \"demonic\", their \"names\" also hide formulas or rites to invoke them correctly. Only after much practice and consequent inner experience over their learning, is that the student becomes able to use them correctly. It can be concluded that the true secrets are secrets for the simple fact they can not be seized by the profane.The origins of the OTO, the process of its emergence and subsequent evolution of the external, remains in v'rios levels, confused and uncertain the superficial students and all who will Dela approximate a first contact. In Brazil the problem has become even more complex due to numerous factors. In my opinion one of these factors would have been caused, in part, exacerbated the authoritarian character super Initiator Thelemic Movement in Brazil. His extreme care in presenting Thelema, so immaculate, finished to cause serious relationship problems with stakeholders who presented themselves at the time. Unfortunately for the OTO, and the Thelemic movement, both the idiosyncrasies of the Initiator as a lack of tact in his handling of the disclosure of the Order were, after his untimely death (1987), inherited and cultivated for its most diehard followers as indisputable precepts and unchanging to be followed - as if they were true dogmas.Nevertheless, and despite these characteristics, merits him being the initiator of the movement in Brazil it can not be denied. However, the method he used for this purpose (perhaps unconsciously, or other problems that will not be discussed here), introduced himself, over the years, antiquated and ineffective - outside the Brazilian reality, and in some cases turning against him, as any person of good sense and ability initiatory can verify, mainly through an analysis of events that occurred between 1962 and 1993.Events that reached deep into the structure of the Order, its initial members, and especially of his own person.The schism occurred in the organization, respectively in 1975 and 1087, show the ineffectiveness of the method used by him.I have been formally initiated into the Order in 1973 by Frater P. XI th and subsequently to detach myself from him, (1975) in English Branch (1975-1989) and having risen in subsequent years, to a high degree in the hierarchy of the Order, I was trained to be able to clarify certain aspects, still somewhat obscure origins, methods and purposes of the OTO - an Order which has attracted much attention, criticism, hate and curiosity of great and varied types of people concerned with the study of occultism in our country. Being the OTO organization alive and obviously directed towards the development of the human being (material and spiritual) - a feature that both MM and others failed to see properly - she has passed, and still will, for necessary changes in its actuation visible in the world.However, the fundamental bases that support Thelemic remain the same and will remain the same until the next Equinox of the Gods.Much of the material used in the preparation of this essay, are part of the private collection of Euclydes Lacerda de Almeida and Society New Aeon, accumulated during the years 1962 and 1995. All this material is available to all those who, without any kind of restrictions, wish parses them - The Law is for all.Thus, for the comfort of readers, I can assure that the doctrines and practices and events depicted herein are authentic. This is perhaps the first attempt, never daring in colloquial Portuguese language, presenting a synthesis intelligible to all, history, External Organization, Doctrines, rituals and practices of the most discussed and mysterious Templar order existing in the Western world, working under the Law dictates of Thelema.Write up something, however superficial it is, about the history of any Order or Semi-Secret Secret Initiation, becomes exhausting and almost impossible to be performed containing correct information. This is due both to the lack of reliable data at our disposal, from one reliable documentation, as the tangled and confusing events involving the evolution of the history of these Orders.Initiation secret orders as its own civilizations, in which they develop, there are presented as many judge static but dynamic in perennial evolve. They evolve according to the trajectory of these civilizations in which they operate, to carry out some work there when needed. Moreover, one should take into account the existence of other Orders and antagonistic System (or other similar remnants of other eras, but already decaying) if degladiando under the impulse of religious and political interests, doing everything in order to detract , demoralize and weaken the influence of their rivals within the society in which they operate simultaneously, and at the general level. Consequently, the sincere seeker will see the face of chaotic and contradictory mass of information and various data, deliberately and systematically mutilated"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"in favor (or against) this or that organization. Most of this material, intending to have arisen from some source and highly privileged hidden.The OTO is an example of this. Even today his true story has not been properly defined.Given this uncertainty, the researcher closer, notice being manipulated in order to skew their conclusions in favor of one or another chain, usually without any historical basis is likely to occur. Notice, too, that much of the material will come to the hands in a \"miraculous\", and containing hints that the author knows more than he says. Is this an old and very used ruse to hide a reality quite the opposite - ie that he did not know as much as you want.Eventually, certain group stands up for others, and begins a meticulous process detratação against their rivals, causing only have knowledge of the other party through the information produced by their inimigos.Tal process, however, presents itself as a sword edged, and sometimes awakens our interest and sympathy for the group or target system (whether political, religious, or initiation). The phenomenon happened to me personally in reference to Freemasonry. After reading and hearing so much against that organization ended up becoming a training. Subsequently, the same occurred with the OTO.Sometimes it takes a current characteristics of its rival and thus disguised, undermines the real foundations of his opponent. Concerning the Thelemic system, initiated by Crowley, that has been used quite frequently, hence emerging \"orders\" spurious disguised as Thelemites were. But are nothing but grotesque imitations of the real current.It can be stated that with regard to the sensational news, the OTO has been a perennial source of material for speculators.Faced with these facts, what is left after all the sincere seeker? I would say common sense, patience, attention and extreme care not to make pig in a poke. Separating the wheat from the chaff has to be performed thumbing up these tools, because without them the researcher will ever achieve its aim, namely, a conclusion entirely devoid of blunders and prejudiced. This zeal, he has before him a huge amount of documents, notes, quotes and information needing to go through serious and strict scrutiny, and interpreted in its real meaning, selecting all present consistency, and that does not offend common sense and our intelligence, such as accepting \"stories\" stating categorically that Talou which \"order\", \"brotherhood\", or any other kind of mystical organization originated in ancient Egypt, or Atlantis, or that we came across one Stellar Tradition, brought do not know by whom, or how, to Earth thousands of years ago. All this, from our point of view are dead-alleys, fairy tales to pamper (or frighten) children - believe them right away who wish to be deceived.Solely with the spirit armed against these pitfalls \"esoteric\" (nice to our fantasies), and not otherwise, the researcher will dig for rare gems, isolating them from the dross of scattered information, factious, and legendary liars. This mining will initially be the only work of it.Here we open a parenthesis:The above is not to say that there can be no civilizations on planets belonging to other stellar system, or that the same has already been in our particular system. You see, the esoteric tradition may have originated thousands of years ago. And it could have come from other corners of the universe. This is perfectly believable. But no current order as we know it today originated in those times. This is what we fight. Say that Freemasonry was founded by Solomon is an outright lie. Freemasonry emerged in the Middle Ages through the Brotherhood of Masons. But the knowledge that she has, may have derived from knowledge originating in Ancient Egypt, like much of the knowledge came Geometric d Ancient Greece, through studies of Pythagoras, Euclydes, and more. However, not Freemasonry nor the alleged Order Rosicrucians swarming in our midst, originated in those ancient times. To say this is to deceive or be deceived ... End of parenthesis.Quite often we find commentators and critics of \"orders\" that have increased desmensuravelmente their stories and acting in the world in the direction of the imaginary, while others were moved by religious fanaticism have them transformed into your own personal pictures, is located, convert them into true \" synagogues of Satan \"(Satan is the term being used here in its pejorative sense, not in its real meaning is quite another), while many others, in the illusion that they are protecting, became the subject of exclusive use for them. The OTO is one of the most intensively orders that suffers the latter type of problem, created by some goofy belonging to certain branches of the Order. Flee from all these unfortunate trends.Thelema has been criticized constantly. These criticisms come to us through letters sent by people who, it seems, felt melindradas on personal beliefs in a first contact with Thelemites. Of course, such people felt"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"\"uncomfortable\" with the attitudes spontaneous freedom of thought and action demonstrated by those who embrace the LawTo send these correspondents, start, op basic acknowledgment that, a priori, simply do not believe us, but carefully searching our theories, acts and practices, free from any constraints and prejudices.

We can not, of course, tell someone what they should think. But Thelema can encourage others to think for themselves, to change their tendencies to question theories and explore all its capabilities and possibilities, both spiritual and material.The only elitism tolerated by Thelema is lead yourself.

However, it is necessary to say, not all are prepared for it. The initiation process reaches the deepest levels of the soul stimulating them. If someone is not ready due to this process, it will be lost or destroyed. I hope not to scare prospective applicants with the statement, but the truth must be told. It is for this reason that we find throughout our lives as characteristics of unbalanced people, they were not prepared and recklessly took oaths beyond their strength.

But the reverse is also true. No civilization lives alone for long. There will always be contact between them; be through conquest wars, immigration, emigration or isolated by travelers, for example, in the case of Marco Polo and others. The complexity of the subject makes it impossible for a detailed study in this paper, and should be studied in specific books, where students may obtain further information about, and a more detailed picture of the influences exerted mutually among civilizations existing in the past and present, in various times in our history. Exceptions are rare in this exchange.The OTO Note - When we name here the OTO, we are not referring to any of the existing organizations in Brazil under this name, including the so-called Caliphate. Unfortunately, since the time of Theodor Reuss has no single OTO, but many, many of which defending ideology diametrically opposed.The OTO (One magical order based on Western techniques eroto-Gnostic, some of them from the Tantra, existed well before Crowley appeared on the scene, but later became the main vehicle for your arose in the latter half of the nineteenth century in Germany - not in ancient Egypt, or some hypothetical planet circling the star Sirius, or even the star itself - developing in lines derived from Tantrism Eastern features Arabic-Persian (Sufi) and Hindu, adapted the modus viventi West by Templar-Masonic Tradition which in turn was influenced by the Qabalistic Tradition Habraica at Ritual Magic Egyptian, Mithraic, Greco-Roman religions and some religious pinches of India. however, this does not mean that the Order had its origin directly connected to one of the traditions mentioned above. From each amalgamating a bit and came up by the genius of the founder, (it was he who was) Carl Kellner and Theodor Reus. We can not here omit to add that some obscure figures, legendary or not appear on the scene coetano the origin of these orders, for example, Christian Rozenkreutz on famous and little known ROSE-CROSS, or the Count of Cagliostro in Freemasonry.Currently, there is no doubt about the mythical character of Christian Rozenkreutz, a \"name\" used to ensure a purpose so far has not publicly declared.Certainly, like any other Order following the paths of the New Aeon, the OTO should escape the \"Christian standards\" (but this does not happen with many existing orders using this name). But the real OTO never abandoned the true ideals of True Christianity, and never uncompromising with currents contrary to it, whatever.I had time available to talk with these people so misinformed, I would give them at first, the basic advice for just to comb carefully the doctrines, the acts and practices Thelemic, freed from its constraints and prejudices in their minds conditioned by doctrines liars, invented by priests and initiates related to the current Black Brothers, acting in the world for thousands of years.However, the OTO is not a democracy but an autocracy. The statement should cause revulsion in many. But they are misinformed as to what is an Order. In a true Order can not exist that we call democracy. The power must emanate from a single focus, and must be obeyed. If the Templar Order had adopted democracy as a regime to be followed, it would not have existed for over two hundred years. In the definition of the word Order all this is implied. The spiritual leader of any Order is who gives the last word. But for this to be so it is necessary that the leader is a True Initiate, for only then he will know what should be done for the general good of the Order. The disciple who does not blindly obey the instructions of his Master is doomed to failure. Every Order to follow the true ideal initiation is an organization governed by para-military principles.Under the leadership of Theodor Reuss OTO achieved great development, taking its final shape. This time are the patents of Papus, HSLewis, and others. With respect to the second quoted see attached document and relevant comments.Only in 1904 is that the name came to public order, and referred to as having a \"big secret\". In 1912, the Anniversary Edition of \"Oriflamme,\" a Masonic journal, announces the secret:\"Our order possesses the key which opens up all Masonic and Hermetic secrets, namely the teachings of sexual magic, and this explains,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"without exception, all the secrets of nature, all the symbols of Freemasonry and all systems of religion \"Well before these events, Reuss been associated with WWWestcoat known leader of the Golden Dawn, who introduced him to John Yarker. Through the latter, Reuss, was patented to start in Germany, working in a Grand Lodge Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis and Mizrain and the Ancient and Accepted Rite of Cerneau. This was accomplished. It was also at this same time they started publishing the Oriflamme.In the same year, 1912, gave up the history, and not very well understood, meeting between Theodor Reuss and Aleister Crowley. The most reliable version of the meeting between the two prominent occultists is the following: In 1911, Crowley was initiated into the First Three Degrees of OTO. An Order that he had thought at the time to be one among many others that had been invited to join. The following year, he was visited by Theodor Reuss, in England, that the accused had publicly revealed the secret of the Central Order in one of his books. Of course, Crowley, vehemently countered the accusation, \"How could he have revealed such a secret if there was not yet reached the IX ° OTO?\". So Reuss, opened \"The Book of Lies\", recently published by Crowley, on page 46, which read: \"Let the Adept be armed with his Magic Wand and provided with his Mystic Rose\". Several authors discuss the veracity of this narrative, but there is little dispute that this ceremony can be easily interpreted as a magical ritual sex. I believe that any and all rituals Crowley veils were prepared for a variety of exotic sexual acts. Magick is all sexual. Indeed, all life is sexual. The Roman Mass itself is a pantomime of sex as much as the Great Rite of the Witches. The real question is: \"What symbolizes sex?\" Ante charges of Reuss, Crowley, immediately understood the nature of the secret of the IX ° OTO. As a result of the meeting between the two occultists, Crowley was named by Reuss, leader of the Order for England and all English-speaking countries. In England the OTO had by name Mysteria Mystica Maxima (MMM).According to some commentators Crowley was not then a member of the OTO. If this were true, which then authorizes the Reuss to Crowley personally censor the publication of that book? Crowley had intuitively discovered the secret of the order, for their own research hidden, and not so common intrujices certain types of \"esoteric\" both within Thelemite as in the external world.Very little remains of the correspondence between Crowley and Reuss. But in one of Crowley's letters, dated 1921, after Reuss apparently have run one tactical retreat because of the objections of some members of Shops Germans against their (apparent) acceptance of the Law of Thelema, there is evidence that the Reuss abdicated OHO station in 1921, and Crowley proposed Reuss replace him in leadership of the Order.Journaling Crowley this period, we find recorded: \"I proclaimed myself to myself OHO; Frater Superior of Oriental Templar Order\"The response Reuss unfortunately lost, although Crowley refer to it in a letter to Tränker, and this implies that Reuss had accepted the proposal of Crowley.If Reuss responded in 1922, it seems, so this letter was lost, probably the basis for declaring that Crowley Reuss resigned in his favor this year.After Reuss' death, there were three remaining active and Grand Masters appointed by him: Heinrich Tränker in Germany; C. Stansfeld Jones in North America, and Crowley, England.Jones indicated Crowley as OHO and Tränker, it seems, the confirmed, although the Constitution of the Order explicitly determine a OHO appointed his successor (man or woman).For all purposes Crowley assumed the leadership of the Order in 1922. However, the reins of leadership were not changed hands easily and calmly. Large number of existing shops in Germany and elsewhere, raised strong opposition to the new leader. Some of these shops simply wished to tread their own paths (as they were in their rights). Other broke definitively with Crowley, due to the Book of the Law (Liber AL vel Legis), especially the content of the Third Chapter. Crowley was actively promulgating the Law of Thelema via OTO. This has been no previously caused friction with Reuss. Are reported to Crowley had previously revised the Rituals at the request of Reuss (which does not seem to be the real story), instilling in them the Doctrines of the New Aeon. Thus, the Order suffered its first division. The Ancient Rituals were, as was to be expected, based on the Old Aeon (Aeon of Osiris), and many shops considered intolerant to change. Peter Koenig says Reuss never used the revised rituals by Crowley.The Aeon of Osiris, or the Magic Formula Dying God (Hiran, Osiris, Mithra, \"Jesus,\" Oannes, etc.) began"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"when men become aware of the sun, and acknowledged that the fertility of the land (and consequently their lives ) depended directly from the vitalizing power of sunlight. Was also perceived as an indisputable fact, that the Sun, the Source of Life, \"was born\" every day in the East and traveled through the sky distributing heat, light and life on earth. But it was also observed that this distributor of life \"was dying\" every day in the West, plunging the world into darkness and cold - a darkness which invoked introspection and fear. Where was the sun?Each night, after the \"death\" of the sun, our ancestors \"prayed\" (\"begging\", and performed rituals to the Sun was born). They also noted the succession of stations, and new rituals were developed to commemorate these stations. As these were unfounded \"fears\" they had been solidly based on a \"reality\" perceived (this reality, of course, was illusory), and trauma was printed in the human psyche. This \"reality\", in turn, formed the basis of the formula of the Aeon of Osiris, or the Formula of God and Resurrect Dead.BUT WHAT HAPPENS THIS WAS A illusory perception. The Sun, as we all know, is not \"born\" and not \"die\" daily, or loses and regains his power over the succession of stations.The Earth is revolving around Him, which is always radiating Light, Heat and Life. This is the current formula, the Formula of the Aeon of Horus. A sun that is neither born nor dies, it is always shining. And we are this Son Horus the Child Jesus, aware of the continuity of existence - because we are sparks of the sun candied meat. Now we can see the universe not as a tragedy but as a process of continuous growth, and that, like the sun, not born nor die.The His eyes are. The greater resistance to Crowley, and changes, departed the German members, whose branch apparently fell under the control of Heinrich Tränker. In 1925, Crowley, Lea Hirsig, Dorothy Olsen and Normann Mudd, met with Heinrich Tränker Helena Degree (wife of Tränker), Eugene Grosch, Karl Germer, Martha Kuntzel, Hopfer, Birven, and other occult leader época.O purpose of the meeting - known as the Conference of Weida - was discussing the acceptance or rejection of the Law of Thelema and discussion of the possibility to unite various factions hidden under the leadership of higher THERION (Crowley).The result was that Grosch, Kuntzel, Mudd, Lea Hirsig, Germer and Dorothy Olsen placed next to Crowley. Grau, Hopfer, Birven and others stayed with Tränker. Again the Order was divided.Crowley remained Third Grand Master of a branch of the OTO in England, United States, Canada and the Germanic countries, until his death in 1947, being succeeded by Karl Germer (Frater Saturnus). Some commentators say there is some doubt on the authenticity of this succession, since the document Germer was no more than an administrative authorization to manage the assets of OTO and Crowley be literary agent.Germer, of course, inherited the Crowley copyrights, which has been ignored through all these years, because currently it is thought that these rights have been inherited by Louis Wilkinson and John Symons. This is not true. Symons and Louis are the only Crowley's literary executors. Another detail, unknown to most, is that Germer never been regularly initiated into the OTO, he was Member of the A. '. A.'., And high degree.Germer was born in Germany in 1885. He distinguished himself as a soldier in the First World War and was an active influence on Pansophy German in 1920. Years later, when the Nazis assumed German government, Germer, was imprisoned because of his Masonic connections and Crowley. When famous prisoner in Prison Alexander-Platz, and later in the Belgian concentration camp, he endured all the abuse and torture of the Gestapo, reciting by heart the Holy Books of Thelema, the front backwards and brings forward until achieve trance Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Germer remained faithful to Thelema until his death in 1962. Instructor was my instructor to date.There are several other reasons to cast doubt the authenticity of Germer's appointment as leader of the Order. But are personal reasons of their own Germer.In a letter to Kenneth Grant (former disciple of Crowley), dated September 24, 1948, Germer says:\"... You should study everything that has been published about the Constitution etc..'s Order and digest it. You should know I'm not the OHO. I do not even know if he would accept the job if I were imposed.\"In another letter (January 18, 1952) states:"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"\"... As you know, I never moved forward through the ranks of the OTO, I do not know the ritual or rituals. But AC appointed me Grand Treasurer General and the financial burden on my shoulders ... I never went systematically through the ranks etc.. I therefore can not advise on this side of the work. I have reached the conviction that you are being trained for this, and I am sure that you have the passion, capacity for intensive work, and willingness to achieve the Master in this department or field. \"The overall position Germer is well summarized in the following words in his letter to Grant January 18, 1952:\"I'm not against the system of OTO, or the system of degrees. Only, paradoxically, have little interest in it.\" And later in outburst:\"I wish someone would take the total work, and responsibility for the position he played in my AC incompetent shoulders. What I hate most of all things is unfurling false pretenses. I repeat what I said before: I never went through the initiation of OTO or graduations. never been present at a celebration of the Gnostic Mass ... I do not know the password, signs, etc.., even the lower degrees of the OTO. Summarizing: AC pointed me to the highest degree and responsibility without me instruct to work. If we want the OTO go ahead we need a competent leader, not only for England but for the world. \" What readers take their conclusions.One thing is undeniable: Germer was a man of few words, extremely honest and firm in his convictions - one character hard to find nowadays.Also meditate readers about the way in which he reached the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Demonstrates that there is no formal and specific rite for this achievement, unless the head of liars writing on the subject in order to garner \"admirers\". Some of these deceivers even make \"tourism\" in deserts to \"meet\" with their \"guardian angels\", as if this is necessary and indispensable. My instructor went through trance in an apartment only room and kitchen in full and noisy New Yorke.Upon reaching the Knowledge and Conversation of the SAG , the Adept is admitted to the Temple of God. Thereafter is the Angel who \"give the orders\": \"no longer I who live, but He lives in me, or as said\" Do what thou wilt. \"After the end of World War II, Germer, migrated to the United States of America, where he died in 1962, the same year I met my late instructor in the A. '. A.'.Thelemic texts - Chapter IIIIn the Second World War, Herr Metzger started the Swiss branch of the OTO (Mysteria Mystica Veritas).Hermann Metzger (Frater Paragranus), resided for many years in Stein, and more recently in Zurich, died in 1990. Metzger was a student of a survivor group OTO Switzerland, led by Theodor Reuss. In 1940, he contacted Karl Germer, who started in Thelemic Doctrines (mind you: not in OTO, but the Doctrines Thelemic) Metzger worked for many years under the supervision of Frederic Mellinger, a high degree of OTO. It is known that Germer cherished high hopes for Paragranus. However, much of these hopes have not been realized until after Germer's death.Over the years, Metzger received other appointments: Grand Master of the Ordo Illuminarum, Grand Master of the Fraternitas Antiqua (founded by Krumm-Heller and Patriarch of the Gnostic Catholic Church. After Germer's death, first his wife S.Germer declared that Marcelo Motta was the surrogate for her husband, but then turned to Metzger (?).The Ordo Illuminarum was founded by Theodor Reuss and Engel in 1883, but separated in 1902. The first joined Hartmann and Klein, on the other permanesceu Ordo Illuminarum until his death in 1931, being replaced by Mier.Krumm-Heller died in 1949, leaving as his successor his son Parzival in FRA Krumm-Heller who, years later presented to my late instructor in the A. '. A.'., And my Initiator in OTO, Carl Germer.There is a current saying that when he died, Krumm-Heller, left as his successor in Switzerland FRA Dr. Herbert Fritche, which in turn stepped down to Fra. Paragranus.However, this leadership Paragranus is"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"highly debatable, since there were other fans who received Succession directly from Krumm-Heller, nationally, and out of obedience Metzger. What is important is that the FRA originally high quality masonic and connected to the OTO separated from this thus losing chain with links is that had started. In Brazil the FRA, as was to be expected, after it has disconnected from Parzival Krumm-Heller, returned to currents linked to the Old Aeon.FRATER achad In North America, the OTO had the initiator Charles Stansfeld Jones, to connect with twelve sincere interested associates in Vancouver, British Columbia (Canada), all being started at the III °. Crowley, in \"Confessions\" said vehemently about the work performed by them.Charles Jones (Frater Parzival as X °) continued for several years, the activities of the OTO, both in the USA and in Canada. Meanwhile, he was allowed a patent of Vancouver, Wilfred T. Smith, found the first Lodge in USA, Los Angeles, California (1930). Wilfred founded the Agape Lodge. Unfortunately, Wilfred, was unable to separate his private life from his magical life, and seduced the wife of one of the members of the Lodge, Jack Parsons. Nevertheless, Wilfred, remained directing the Lodge until 1942, when it was removed by Crowley, Jack Parsons by naming the new Leader.Charles Stansfeld Jones was born on April 2, 1886 in London, his parents were Canadian.Lived in Columbia the longest of his life. On December 24, 1909, became a Probationer under the tutelage of Crowley. The Moto Magic was chosen \"Unis in Omnibus (All in One).\"In 1913 he reached the degree of Neophyte of the A. '. A.'., Under Moto Magic \"Achad,\" meaning \"A\". What he was before being recognized as the Son of Magical Crowley (Son promised in Liber AL) is not of much importance. We are more interested in what he has become after a series of magical workings performed by Soror Hilarion (Jane Foster, \"The Cat\" - The Cat) and the Great Beast 666 (Aleister Crowley) in 1915.Jones, aka Frater Achad, Parzival Xth and VIOOIV, found the Key of the Book of the Law in 1917, changing the title of this book Liber L. Legislative level to Liber AL Legislative level and, consequently, causing that several passages in the dark paper would be understood by Crowley. For this, and maybe a few more ideas, Thelema owes much to Jones, but not as a great man - but precisely as a temporary vehicle for one that was bigger than him.Jones was active for many years in the OTO, but apparently was indifferent to the teachings in this order on the sexual magic .. Their searches were purely spiritual, and he used the methods of magical ceremony of the Golden Dawn and the A. '. A.'., More than those of the OTO.ADDENDUM TO CHAPTER C. Stansfeld JONES Only towards illustration presented here is a very brief description of the ideas of Ahad, because the subject is vast and requires readers to have at least enough intimacy with the real Thelemic esoteric doctrines. The first function of a Mage (not to be confused with Magician ) is the proclamation or \"pronunciation\" WORD OF AEON he inaugurates. For example: the word of the Magus of the Aeon of Osiris was INRI. This is a word that contains in itself the whole Magical Formula of the Aeon. Achad kept opinão THELEMA that was not such a word in this Aeon, but, as stated in AL, the WORD OF LAW, not the Aeon; ABRAHADABRA and that it was not the word, but the key of the rituals. Thus, even Thelema nor Abrahadabra met the requirements of the Magic Tradition.Frater Achad defended the thesis that the Liber AL was received by Crowley in 1904, that there had been, at the time, reached the degree of MAGUS. In fact, the only degree was achieved by Crowley \"Eleven years' later, ie in 1915. Therefore, it is not surprising that Crowley has not uttered the Word of the Aeon. Crowley reached the Degree of Master of the Temple in 1906, becoming what is known in the terminology magic, \"An Inhabitant of the City of the Pyramids.\" This is represented in A. '. A.'. the Third Sephira, Binah, Understanding."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"In order that depends for its existence on the External strict hierarchy, no degree can be achieved by an Adept, unless the level immediately preceding it has been achieved by his disciple. In other words: while Achad was not qualified to take the place of the City of the Pyramids Therion, Aleister Crowley would not be in a position to claim the degree and speak the Word of the Aeon. Towards Crowley can do this, Achad, took the most serious responsibility that it is possible for any mortal to take the Path of Attainment Magic, that is, he had to take \"The Oath of the Abyss\" and cross it successfully. This he did, and this was his righteousness and spiritual integrity that he cried not only have taken the dive to empower Crowley in advance to the Grade of Magus, but also state that remained in the Abyss - with all that means horror - for a whole cycle Saturn, ie 29 years - from 1916 to 1945.Still, Crowlet remained silent; any word came to him. Ahad writes in a letter dated 1916: \"After he (Crowley) realize that I had jumped in the Abyss in his interest, so he can get the 9th = 2, and then I wrote\" stand still in profundis. \"Wrote an essay on God be a sadist two days ago, and yesterday I went through a magical ceremony, but nothing seems to revive me. I can not wait to learn the Word itself. believe that you could do this for ten minutes the Word come. \" However, according to Achad, the Word did not come to Crowley, and in 1926, during a series of tests (this continued until 1945), the Achad received. In some sense, Achad, was right, but perhaps not in the Way that thought. The reflection magic Aeon of Horus is Hoor-Paar-Kraat, the God of Silence, or Talking In Silence. The Minister of this God is Aiwass. Harpocrates is a particular formula Seth, and his word is vibrated in silence. JACK PARSONS Jack Parsons, North American young scientist, largely contributed in founding the \"Jet Propulsion Laboratory\" in Arroyo Seco. After his death, one of the craters on the Moon is named in tribute to the development of their work in research fuel rockets that put Americans in space. The tragic death of Parsons is involved in great mystery, which arise political intrigue and espionage. Jack Parsons died on June 17, 1952, to \"drop\" a bottle containing mercury fulminate, an explosive highly unstable.In 1948, Parsons, had taken the Oath of the Abyss and Moto Magic Belarion.Before that, in 1945, L. Ron Hubbard began at Agapé Lodge. Parsons saw that Hubbard had a great magical potential. Parsons wrote to Crowley about Ron Hubbard: \"He is the most Thelemic person I've met and is in complete accord with our principles.'s Also interested in establishing the New Aeon.\"Not long after, Hubbard's wife runs off with Parsons. Losing Betty Parsons strives to magically attract another mate. Succeeded in February 1946, when Crowley writes about a young woman named Marjorie Cameron Parsons wrote several books and texts, among which detacam \"Freedom Is A Two-Edged Sword\" and \"Liber 49\" (The Book of Babalon) the fundamental basis of the followers of Parsons.After his \"wanderings\" in the world thelemic Ron Hubbard founded the United States of America, Scientology, quickly becoming a rich religious organization they belong to various stars of American cinema, including J.Travolta.Germer died in 1962, and the OTO was further fragmentation, giving rise to several independent branches arise in the world. The main cause of this fragmentation can be found in dubious testament left by Germer, which are determined textually:'With reference to the property of Ordo Templi Orientis, of which I am the head, I command that is passed to the Head of the Order, but my wife, Mrs. Dasha E. -Andrea Germer, is the executor of this part of my will with Frederic Mellinger X º '(the italics are mine)In the text, in English, (see document) the word HEAD (head) is written in the plural form (HEADS). But the problem is: WHO WERE THESE HEADS? Germer not mention names. In fact, neither could quote them, because the Order has only a head and not several. It is totally unlikely to have it confused the position of Head with that of the King Kings are several, each country has a King, and these Kings pay obedience to the Outer Head, which is a.Kings would, in other words, the National Leaders of each branch of the Order. But this is, as I said, totally unlikely because most off the Kings was led by OTO Germer, ie,"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"that OTYO led by Crowley. What attribute this failure? Germer, is known by all, showed himself zealous, disciplined, meticulous and mindful of their duties, mainly on the OTO. I still do not know for sure because Germer did so. Of course there are many opinions about it.But none of them convincing. Currently the most widely accepted is the one that Germer, really wanted to destroy the Order since realized that she would have no future as an organization genuinely thelemic. This could already be perceived by his letters to K.Grant. This was implied when he did not follow the advice of Crowley in making a general change in the Order and its rituals. Another failure Germer was to appoint his wife as executor of his will in relation to the Order. Mrs. Germer even belonged to the Board Members of the Order. Anyway, hence the confusion derived was full and therefore appeared several \"heads\", each pulling for their grilled sardines. KENNETH GRANT In England, Kenneth Grant (Frater Aossic Aiwass) assumes the title of OHO, and dissolves the structure of the Masonic Order. Kenneth Grant was patented in 1951 or 1952 to work with the First Three Degrees of the Order. All was well between him and Germer until 1955, when Grant founded Shop (New Isis) with Eleven Degrees, whose rituals were designed by himself. Published a Manifesto, by sending a copy Germer, but refused to send the Rituals, alleging that could be handled by the wrong hands. Before this, Germer, immediately (July 20, 1955) sent him a registered letter expelling him from the OTO. Grant ignored the letter and continued his work of turning off Germer. Some authors claim that this was not the main reason for the reaction Germer, but some connections initiated by Grant, with other branches of the Order. Grant The idea would be to give the OTO a structure similar to A. '. A.' . But it happens that the two orders are totally different in their purpose and organization. To avoid failure, Grant made a bigger mistake by joining your organization to chains that have nothing to do with Thelema.In order to clarify the difference between the A. '. A.'. and OTO Germer in 1940 escxreveu Crowley requesting a definitive statement about the differences between the OTO and A. '. A.'. - Crowley replied:\"The difference between the A. '. A.'. OTO and is very clear and simple. A. A '. A..' Is an everlasting institution, and entirely secret. There is no communication between its members. Theoretically, a member knows only his superior who started, and anyone else introduced by himself. walks Order lines purely espirituais.O goal of becoming a member is completely simple. The first goal is the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The next goal, omitting considerations relating to the Grades 4 = 5 and 7 = 4, is the crossing of the Abyss, and fulfilling the Degree of Master of the Temple. This is described in detail, especially in Liber 418. Very little is written about degrees 5 = 6, ie, the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, because it's deeply secretive and tortalmente individual.'s impossible to spell out conditions, or write detailed experiments involving the subject. OTO has nothing to do with it, except that The Book of the Law and the Word of the Aeon are essential principles of the members \" GRADY MacMurtry In the United States, another branch was established by Grady MacMurtry (Hymenaeus Alpha).MacMurtry started out at Agapé Lodge. Being an officer in the U.S. Army, sailed for England during the Second World War. Met with Crowley, and this began directly to IX ° (1946). Therefore MacMurtry not been regularly initiated, passed and not the medium grades of Order. The same happened with Germer, and Euclydes Marcelo Mota Lacerda.Only the latter first received the First Three Degrees, before receiving the IX °.There is a letter from Crowley authorizing MacMurtry to take charge of organizing the North American Branch upon his return to America after the war, in another letter, Crowley, the neomeia his representative, and permitted to use the letter if he might feel Order that tended to close their doors. However, the two appointments were subject to ratification by Germer. Germer never ratified both"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"documents, but also never annulled.Germer was a quiet man, given to isolation. Under his administration ceased OTO initiations of new members. His attention was summed up in focusing solely on publications program of books Crowley. At this time, my instructor, actively participated in this program. Liber Aleph was printed in Brazil by him. From what we can see, Germer, did not care for the evolution of the OTO.Hymenaeus Alpha tried several times to contact other branches of the Order, to maintain fraternal bonds between them. Never his initiative was accepted.Hymenaeus BETA (W B ***** ****) With the death of MacMurtry, was \"elected\" in September 1985, Hymenaeus Beta as the new \"Calipha\". But Hymenaus Beta is just the leading branch of the OTO known as \"Caliphado\", a name coined after Germer's death.At first it seemed that this new leader of the Branch of the OTO in the United States of America (Caliphado), make the organization what it should be, or what it claims to be.However, this did not happen. The imbalance magical several leaders of the organization became an impediment to this achievement.METZGER A year after the death of Germer, Metzger was elected OHO by his followers in Switzerland. His immediate superior in the OTO, Mellinger, was not notified of it not being late and indirectly. As a performer, along with Sasha Germer, Germer's will on matters of the Order tried to cancel the procedure. All in vain. Indiscipline was general. However, the action of Metzger isolated his group and himself, the rest of the OTO until his death.OTOA Died in 1960 in Madrid, Lucien-François, leaving the government of the Spanish branch of the OTO and the Gnostic Church of Memphis and Mizrain, Dr. Ortier, which, because of his advanced age, requested help Hector François. Estge Branch became known as OTOA (Ordo Templi Orientis Antiqua) In 1963, Jean-Maine met in Haiti with Michael Bertieux and introduces the OTO, charging him organize one branch of the Order in the United States and America South In the same year, and due to the state of Ortier, Jean-Maine is consecrated Patriarch and Head of OTOA, and in 1970 the post goes to Bertieux. This group has teamed up with Kenneth Grant. AEON OF MAAT In Canada, the most significant disciple of Crowley, C. Jones (Frater Achad), the discoverer of the \"Key\" of Liber AL, and considered by Crowley, Magical his Son, has initiated a branch of the Order, as seen earlier, in April 2, 1948, one year after death Crowley, Jones, based on the development of their own research of the Book of Law, announces the beginning of the Age of Maat - precisely 40 years after the Equinox of the Gods in 1904, when Aiwass announced the beginning of the New Aeon, which should last approximately two thousand years. Frater Achad called the New Age of MA-ION, the Aeon of Truth and Justice.Achad based his Cult of Ma-Ion on a \"revelation\" that he said he found in the text of Liber AL, just in the last verse of Chapter I: \"The Manifestation of Nuit is at the end\" (\"The Manifestation of Nuit is at an end \"). Taking this literally, as Achad did, that is, both ends of the word manifestation, the MA-ION, which he"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"declared to be the true name of the Aeon of Maat or Ma, the Egyptian Goddess of Justice.But it seems that Achad was obsessed by the idea of being a new Messiah, powerful enough to redeem man from his calamities of the Aeon of Horus, which, judging by his private correspondence, attributed to the machinations of Aiwass. For him Aiwass become a demon with the clear purpose of destroying humanity.It is known that Achad tried to Atravessia the Abyss, and afterward presented with strong characteristics of madness. But this is another story that we report in another paper. BRAZIL MARCELO Motta (FATER PARZIVAL XI º) In Brazil, Marcelo Motta, following the death of Germer and after serious friction with Kenneth Grant (whom he regarded as the OHO for years) separates from the English branch, founds a lodge and self-entitled the OHO World based on the statement (in writing) of Sascha Germer that her husband, Germer appointed Marcelo Motta \"The follower\" (The Follower) in a letter. This \"charter\" was never found. Marcelo Motta claimed that the documents had been destroyed by the U.S. Secret Service, or the Zionists, the Brazilian Information Service (1961).When trying to enforce their position OHO, will the United States enters into litigation with MacMurtry and several other characters from the American occult scene, claiming to be the true heir of the copyrights of the works of Crowley. Loses the case at the Supreme Court of California. After this, he returned to Brazil. Apparently, isolates from the work he had begun years before.Marcelo Motta died in 1987 in the city of Teresopolis, all alone in his residence. His body was only found by a maid, a day after the denouement. His remains lie in the cemetery of that city FRATER ASTER IX ° Also in Brazil, after hanging up the Branch initiated by Marcelo Motta, then Frater Zarathustra º III (1975), binds to the English Branch (Kenneth Grant) and is affiliated to the American Branch. Later, disagreeing with the doctrines of anti-Thelemic K.Grant, assumes the position of Frater Superior to Brazil, under Moto Magic Aster IX º, maintaining friendly ties with the American Branch. Adopts some ideas of Frater Achad and Jack Parsons by judges them of great interest for the development of order and being within the guidelines Thelemic, and founded three independent shops.Parallel to these activities, Frater Aster, founded SOCIETY NEW AEON (1975) to follow up the release of Thelema idependentemente any ties with the various branches of the OTO in the world. This act is supported by several esoteric Brazilians. Due to the complex events leading to the founding of the New Aeon Society, under the leadership of Frater A., the subject will be treated elsewhere, where details will be presented and much unpublished to the public Brazil will be revealed as part of the history of Thelema in Brazil.Not discussed here, of course, \"orders\" or telling yourself Thelemic organizations, but in reality clearly fleeing the Doctrines System. Among these organizations cite the OTOA the Caliphado, Typhoniano System, and FRA Brazilian and one led by Tau Baphomet.Before ending this part of the test, we need to make some observations concerning four new \"branches\" that emerged in the last five years.The first branch of the original English. Two Branch led by Marcelo Motta (one in Brazil and another in Australia), and the fourth of the Brazilian Branch led by Frater A.When my instructor died, he left as trustee a Mr. B. Stone which according learned through correspondence with himself, continued the work of Marcelo Motta in the United States. But a faction did not agree with the established by Motta, migrated to Australia creating the \"Foundation Parzival XI °\". This new division is to be supposed that the Lodge Nuit (Brazil) has been isolated in these movements.Branch English, such Ripel Frank founded an order called Ordo Rosae Mysticae, which aims to be an"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"evolution of the OTO. Ripel uses to justify his order the suggestion made by Crowley to Germer, the need for a restructuring of the OTO. But, my old instructor always warned me: \"a change is valid, but always keeping the original basic principles.\"In his alleged change Ripel going so far as to create a Tree of Life Sephiroth fourteen, which, to say the least, it's crazy - something like what happened to Fra Schad that reversed the position of the Serpent on the Tree of Wisdom Life.Also the Brazilian Branch, arose a totally no-brainer, that has nothing to do with the OTO and Thelema with much less. Fortunately this group was short-lived, as predicted by Frater A.Thelemic texts - Chapter IV RITUALS Initially the Rituals of the OTO were essentially Masonic in the strictest sense of the term.Later, when accepting the Law of Thelema, these rituals were partly modified by Crowley, who gave them a deep meaning \"magician\" according to the New Law is said that these rituals were modified at the request of Reuss. This is a \"story\" that is not consistent with reality, because Reuss that Crowley did not accept mingle with the OTO and Thelema never used such rituals modified.Now, as we all must understand, it is inevitable that during the course of any current, certain aspects outdated or even wrong, to be replaced by more updated.Original System of the OTO which Crowley was the leader of the faction accepting the Law of Thelema as a basis for work, was based on a structure entirely Masonic. Crowley did not alter this structure, although it redone Rituals of degrees lower.In the Old Aeon, Death was the crux of the system, hence the legends of Osiris, Hiran, \"Jesus\", Atthis, etc.. - The legend is perfectly presented in the Middle Chamber (Masonry Osirian) when Hiram is murdered by the Three Companions. Currently, we know to be the death an illusion created by the ego. Therefore, in the New System, Life and death are seen as a continuous phenomenon. This new point of view should be studied and meditated on the writings of Crowley and other authors who managed to grasp the problem (See specifically \"Little Essays Toward Truth\"). However, according to some authors personality Crowley failed to realize Initiation System (Masonic) outside the profile postulated by Ancient Initiatory Orders; why he perpetuated the Antido system described in \"The Equinox\" - Vol III N.1. It is also important to check that Crowley also failed to change the \"Legend of the Third Kind,\" that keeps spinning around a murder, only changing the name of the dead character. Karl Germer, also, in turn, kept the Old System. Incidentally Germer almost \"forgot\" the OTO in every way.In 1975, Marcelo Motta, as Kenneth Grant, tried to change the characteristics of rituals, making them more consistent with the New Aeon (especially the Grade III º). But these new rituals only changed nuances Masonic osirianas eg, the \"proofs\" of the Four Elements. And even these changes only gave \"Four Elements\" a version somewhat forced, based on the perception of the Four Princes of the World. However, in Grade III º has become extremely difficult to change the context. Thus, Marcelo Motta, took the Grade I º \"vision of the Hangman\" which is, as stated by Crowley \"a sense of sacrifice and therefore a false idea.\" \"The whole idea of sacrifice is a misunderstanding of the nature.\" But we can not take credit for Marcelo Motta in trying to improve these rituals.As far as I know now, the American branch follows the original Rituals corrected by Crowley, and unfortunately published, which, in my opinion, takes them all value. Sure!All initiatory ritual that is published becomes worthless magical. It is the same as a student to know the feedbacks of a labial in advance.When overriding by circumstances as well known by the Members of the Society New Aeon, Frater A. seen in the contingency to take the Tenth Degree OTO (one degree purely administrative) in Brazil, the need to develop new rituals for Work in First Three Degrees with explicit bases Thelemic, and fill the gaps according to the precepts of Thelema to the Works of Outer Circles.Effectively, it was not easy to compose these rituals, adapting them at the same time, the Brazilian conditions, the characteristics set forth in the Articles of SNAe. Ace and fundamental guidelines Thelemic. It was necessary to stop the trend of compromise, even minimally, with the currents exist there, which surely would be instilled in the minds of new aspirants. The OTO was not made to please anyone,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"but to foster new thinking. A thought destroyer of all existing trends. And for the knowledge of a certain writer: \"The Supplicant have no place in this world.After much research, it was finally established at a meeting of the Directors of SNAe., The Brazilian organization would follow in its First Three Degrees Masonic structure (but not Osirian), following a tradition maintained since the time of the original founder. However, in the Third Degree, the problem of \"Death\" took another face, obeying the lawThe remaining degrees follow entirely different lines from those followed previously, except, of course, the Grade IX thereof, in which is contained the Secret Order Central.For obvious reasons we can not, here, provide details regarding the structure of these degrees.Some (authors, members of the order, etc) claim there Rituals for all grades. This has always been a big mistake. Above Grade VI º no specific rituals for \"Initiation\", as in Freemasonry Osirian, although there are other types of rituals to be performed individually or in groups.The reasons for such rituals they have not become obvious to any Initiate, and how much is just knowing.Another point to be clarified relates to the adaptation of the presence Rituals Member Femininos.Os previous rituals did not have the concern of this detail, they dealt a system has underpinned the Old Aeon (Patriarchal) where the woman had no status. Speaking clearer: the rituals were riddled past the idea of a Creator Male, etc.. This was taken into account, and the structure of degrees began to serve this specific detail.In the next chapter the readers knowledge tomrão a summary of Degrees of OTO, as developed by Crowley. It would not be necessary to say that these rituals have been previously and porvárias times, and in several books, published openly. We follow here \"SECRET RITUALS OF THE OTO\" by Francis King. But anyway I will use some veils, because I disagree with the initiative that you and those who facilitated the publication.Anyone wanting satisafaze curiosity acquiring the book by Francis King. With respect to higher grades will use the provisions by Kenneth Grant in several of his books.Under the \"leadership\" before Theodor Reuss OTO seems to have possessed a Constitution Journal. It is impossible for us to know details of the structure of their rituals.By the looks disappeared. Probably been destroyed by the Nazis during the Second World War. But it seems to have existed a constitution similar to that enacted in January 22, 1906, by Theodor Reuss.Members of the Order were then classified as follows: Probationers (including Theosophists) Students or Lay Brothers (Masons Members) Initiates Officers or Members.Structure Journal I Probationers º º Minerval II III º Craftsman Macau Macau IVth Scottish Rosa Cruz V º º Templar VI VII º Mystic Templar Templar VIII º East IX ° Perfect IlluminatedAfter 1917, radical changes were made.

From First to Sixth Grade, jobs are ritualistic, referring to an unorthodox interpretation of Masonic Symbolism. The Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Grades have no rituals in being where the word occurs in Freemasonry. Members of these degrees are instructed \"orally\" and are initiated into tantric practices. Later Crowley created an Eleventh Grade, whose nature is quite difficult to be understood by the uninitiated. This links up with what is called \"Red Elixir\", and Sufi practices.\"Many people do not fully understand what is a ritual. Crowley explains:\"\"It's a celebration of the adventures of God we intend to 'invoke'. Now in OTO, being the object of the initiation ceremony of the Applicant, is he whose Path in Eternity is shown in dramatic form.

But I must warn you that everything written so far can be found (by Student attentive) in various books sold in bookstores specializing in esotericism. So I am not revealing any \"secret\" and therefore am not betraying my oath.Thelemic texts - Chapter VThe OTO IN BRAZILWe of Thelema have a serious commitment to truth. And that has us in trouble, as a mess of worms. However, as the saying goes, are part of the job.Than present witness a phenomenon of extraordinary features and meanings is out of the question. Is now being shown that serious research and inquiry in the field of religion and esotericism are finally through the sieve of true scientific research. And it is clear that this fact public is turning \"our social\" topsy-turvy. This is of course a number of thoughtful and researchers, among whom Crowley, Charles S. Jones, Anton Wilson, Ken Wilber, etc..The recent discovery and dissemination of works of these giants in the field of Religion and the Occult, has provided the strength, the lure of freedom and a new direction in human thought.The phenomenon also has offered us a new interpretation, more conscious of the important and crucial problems penalizing the human race end of this century. Therefore, it is a fortunate circumstance that we can now express ourselves more freely than in years past, and publish relevant issues until recently considered \"taboo\" - sharply during the period in which several South American countries were under a exception, including Brazil, whose military dictatorship delayed our progress in years. Topics, many of them previously unknown in our land, it is a country whose population suffers a real lack of information (political, scientific and philosophical) for various reasons it is not our job now discuss. This undoubtedly left us somewhat alienated in various sectors. Hopefully this does not happen in our country. Yet another danger is emerging in our midst. This danger is represented by sects created by so-called evangelicals who want to convert, even by force, men and women of other faiths and for this, persecute, defame, and seek to discredit these other beliefs, demonstrating hidden by morbid fanaticism Behind the preaching \"in the name of the Lord.\"Hopefully this will be overcome in an intelligent way. For New Dawn, a sunny morning in human consciousness - for so many centuries tolida in their legitimate aspirations and limited by the shackles forged by false Christianity - the is announced.The most striking manifestation of this New Morning found in the rapid and sudden change occurred in the thinking of many scholars, mystics and researchers regarding the interpretation of various sacred texts, releasing large numbers of individuals from the shackles of a brutal history escravisador dogmatism.As stated by a serious thinker, \"the ecclesiastical power allied to political and financial power put a tourniquet on the mind of the West for fifteen hundred years.\" Now, to our relief, this tourniquet begins to be removed, and this thanks to the emergence of the New Aeon, whose energies tend toward a full and complete freedom of inquiry, expression and life. \"You are free\" - Announces New LawFor countless centuries echo in our ears the screams of pain, anguish and despair of those who, in one way or another, dared to confront the institutionalized lie of the followers of the \"Dying God\".At least part of the truth begins to be revealed in spite of contrary forces, those same forces who burned Giordano Bruno, Joanna D'Arc, Jacques de Molay, and thousands of men and women bastions of Freedom and Truth.Now, the sacred books of the various religions in the world, have been searched and searched under a new light on the mechanism of their own structures. This research, progressing at a rapid pace, brings us to the point where it puts into question the basic (pseuda) \"historicity\" of so-called \"Holy Scriptures\", which was criminal doubt themselves, even in a letter . Scholars of the texts of these books and the \"life\" of the founders of religions, begin to declare openly that the narratives contained in these texts can no longer be accepted as real events, or historical. Or consist of an allegorical way to convey certain knowledge, or blur events and knowledge not well understood by our ancestors - events and knowledge that now begin to be searched under other names and points of view: that are mostly pure fabrication . For us the \"New"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Testament\" is a deliberate fusion of various ancient religions, popular beliefs and fables mixed with words pass secret orders operating in distant times.In this context, the Church of Rome, against several of these discoveries, and fearful of losing the reins of temporal power (because it no longer has spiritual) exerted on the mass begins to \"revisit\" some of its dogmas and some of its \"stories\". See, for example, the case of the supposed \"Holy Shroud\", the Church, not long ago publicly acknowledged as false (see attachment).Under the blow of these textual criticism desferidas with the relentless power of facts, the building super protected dogmas now has its foundations shaken. This shock appears to have been recently emphasized by publications (finally coming to Brazil) divulgndo scholarly translations and commentaries of various texts, such as THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS \",\" The Nag Hammadi Library \", etc.., In particular the case of Christianity. These translations and comments bring to light many historical facts hitherto kept in strictest confidence by the ecclesiastical authorities, and are bound to cause a real turnaround in the \"story\" and evolution (evolution will be the same?) of the Church of Rome.It's hard, very hard and very tiring to write on any subject when most people want to know it perfectly well by reading articles surface - that is, superficially, truncated, condensed, limited, hasty, journalistic and, above all, written as a politico-religious trend of their \"reports\". Such is the case of religion and esotericism, especially in the field Thelemic.The esotericism which is being released in the middle profane current is biased and, what is worse, WRONG. There is esotericism, but crass imitation of Him. As an example, we would say that the distance between the 'esoteric', which is made so much noise, it is said, and discloses the wheels of bars and writes in several magazines 'specialized', and sold as a panacea for all human ills, is the Real Esoteric, is the same distance between the \"knowledge\" of a humble electrician, and Science and Technique of an Electrical Engineer. There is only one fundamental difference: the humble electrician vera has its function in the social context, while the 'esoteric' no, unless one of confusion, misinformation, directed the embromação for personal and group in the sense of enrichment easy. Such is the harsh reality, despite the \"promoters\" of the 'esoteric' in our country and around the world.The people, as always, in the credibility innocent is being cheated in favor of a slag \"magicians\", \"gurus\", \"tarot card readers\", \"Qabalists, etc.., Benefiting at the expense of ignorance, and it is aided by media ignoble. This is an unforgivable crime - whoever it hurts that my claim.The same criminal panorama displayed above is found in relation to organized religions (official, as stated by some authors), those \"evangelical\", and the 'orders' (which are true des-orders),' secret fraternities of inciação (who secret only have the name) and, more sharply, well spoken, \"schools of magic\", as if the Magic could be learned in classrooms as any school subject, as costumed in the Harry Potter films. All these issues, which it is said without the slightest knowledge of elements entirely unbalanced spiritually, are intricacies in which students will surely be lost.At this point it would be useful to readers meditate on the words \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" The sentence should be sufficiently enlightening to the wise about our point of view. Little or nothing I can do for the deaf. Remember also that MAGIC POWERS WERE NEVER INDICATORS spiritual evolution. One does not imply the other ..... because, otherwise, there would be no black magicians.Attitudes of the past to the Esoteric in general and in particular with the Magic - especially during the Middle Ages, when the Church of Rome reigned absolute and sent to the fire whomever descordasse (including some of his current \"Santos\") - come to us almost intact under the force of centuries of pure conditioning, and always tended toward two extremes: on the one hand there were those condemning the Magic as \"an art of the devil\" (Poor Devil. takes the blame for everything) and a danger to the human soul, while others put on a pedestal and the extraordinarily high level of sacrosanct. Both of these trends are obvimente, unbalanced. In both cases the effect on impressionable, and for those interested in Magic, has been devastating. People remain, so to speak, \"between a rock and a hard place.\" Magic or pollutes us and destroys us spiritually, being an art diabolical, or us, \"unclean\" (as would have us believe the padrecos and 'bishops') to pollute. It is not difficult to understand intelligent man that the two fallacies have the aim to get away from all the Royal Esoteric Science.The Magic (more correctly Magick), as taught and practiced in Reais initiatic centers (not established that can be located in any city in the world), escapes all that smacks of superstition, faniatismo, \"religiosity\" and dogmatism, Of course, the so-called \"Satanism\".Magic does not produce miracles and no promises 'salvation'. Magic also does not work to help you conquer your neighbor's wife, or make it rain, or give demonstrations circus, like breaking glasses distance"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"or dominate mentally. We have nothing to do with those who want to conquer your neighbor's wife, or husband next. There are other ways much more effective for these worldly things than the use of the Sacred Magic - means much more efficient and not \"hidden\". All this, for us, is classified as Black Magic, and the worst kind of tell by the way ....As Crowley tells us: \"Every magical act, not directed to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, is Black Magic\"The magic is, like all science and art, totally averse to considerations \"misticoides\", \"religious\", \"personal\" and \"theological\". She is not demonic, much less be seen as untouched by \"human uncleanness.\" First, because we are not as unclean as would have us believe that we are, and second, it is as demonic as it is psychology, or chemistry, or medicine. Magic is just science and art through which man reaches certain levels of consciousness and awareness of Self and the Universe which has His Being Or as Aleister Crowley: \"Science and Art of causing Change covenant with the Will . \" Understand this phrase in all its breadth and depth is to get the Key of Magic.Few are those upon whom my words do not arouse hatred, anger and disgust. I also know that those \"other\" against which I have nothing personally, I will never forgive the irreverence and tone free of my criticisms of Marcelo Motta. This matters little. I do not write to please, but to inform. When starting this work, not ignorant to try to wake sleeping and dreaming is always difficult and dangerous, especially when they like to sleep and dream their illusions.As much as the work does not arouse sympathies and approvals, yet I fulfill my function.I am sure that everyone will pay a service, within the limits allowed by my intelligence and initiatory level (which is not much), but enough to combat existing lie around the topics that are covered here.Thelemic texts - Chapter VIThe first phase of my initiation was over. I refer here to my magical training in the period from 1970 to 1973, when my appointment to the Grade of Neophyte of the A. '. A.'., Adopting the Moto Magic T. '.. My Daily Magic of the time describes, in detail, all my actions and reactions of the period. In the book \"MY TRUE NAME\" (see also \"BLACK GODDESS\") interested will find a poetic description of it. For a long time, which now seems so short, I was sorely tested by ordeals succeeding in everyday life.The painful process of disconnecting yourself from old habits (atavistic constraints), to suffer the chaos between two positions strongly attracting the Aspirant, and launch into the unknown, increased, increasingly, to the extent that continued practice. The process seemed endless. Until one day finally ended torture. How far could feel I won the initial period the basic path he intended to walk, and engendered the \"boy\" in myself.The phase ended with the glimpse terribly magnificent and magnificently terrible vision (certain mystical attainments have no chance to be described in common parlance) of humans and their relationship with the Universe (He sees this Clockwork Universe). I also was given realize the futility of human ambition, compared with the Vision, and full impermanence of things. The whole experience was reported to my instructor in a poem.Immediately after this, he confirmed the level achieved by a recording speakerphone and then by a letter. I enjoyed there had been a Universe dynamic, mutable. Nothing in it being permanent. Everything changing every moment, flowing endlessly, like the images of a colossal kaleidoscope.But there was also a total perception, an experience full meta-cosmic. I've just discussed, and tiny period of time - but at length eternal - the threshold of the Clockwork World Vision, and Vision imbued me with the desire for silent retreat. However, one must be destroyed (the Ego) still remained. The \"Devil presumption\" planted a seed in my heart, and foolishly accepted the \"powers\" and \"positions\", which would be invested due to the degree achieved. Today I realize how great was my foolishness. I should have taken the Silent Work of a life dedicated to the Great Work, divorcing myself from structures and systems saturated bond hierarchical organizations, purely based on human vanity.Shortly after the disaster happened. Infighting and subsequent breakup of the organization of which I was a member, embodied that factor infinite and unknown, indicating to me the path to take in my final decision.At the time, I was preparing myself to practice intensely in intuiro to achieve the next degree, related to"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Yesod, the Way of the Arrow (going from Malkuth to Kheter, and whose value is 26 in Kabbalah), to go in the future, be released beyond the arch Qesheth the \"Rainbow of Promise\"- Qesheth is formed by paths departing from Malkuth - toward the Veil Paroketh, it has to be \"ripped\" by the Aspirant \"Crossing\" the Way of the Tower in his ascent to the Sun This is the Way fast and direct avoiding the temptations Forces Unbalanced other Pillars. The only objection is that it avoids the clash salutary and perhaps necessary and also was able to identify the student with the illusions created by the mind.Was so engrossed in preparing this new step that I could not clearly see the weft woven and developed around me, just by those people to whom I had dedicated myself over my affection and attention. Herein the culprit was myself. Should have taken into account, and seriously, the words of my instructor, \"Trust no one, not even me.\" So do not blame them. Only later did I realize that the \"demon of jealousy and ambition,\" had taken the personality of those people. After all, they had not had any experience towards initiation.Their degrees in OTO were formal and not real. Them were granted only to constitute the initial framework of our organization (later, of course, they would pass by the practices and rituals necessary for their true initiations.).After those events (1975), which in reality were true ordeal of time, I practically removed from the organizations that helped to build, I retreated into silence (as it should have done before) so, alone, listening only to the voice \"of Him standing up for myself, \"get ready for the next hard climb up and presenting in front of me.At this time, unfortunately for us all, my instructor, it seems, tried to \"Atravessia the Abyss\" and, in view of subsequent events, he failed in this attempt.The facts and events surrounding this whole adventure, are the points to be discussed in the course of this essay.Seventeen years have passed since the publication of \"The Equinox of the Gods\" - Being the Equinox in Brazil - Vol I N.1. And the more I reread the \"Final Note\" (p.154), more haunting me against such a \"Note\" appears in a publication strictly esoteric, mainly because of having news over the last few years, the sad course and of unfortunate events at the heart of so-called Brazilian OTO (SOTO). And as I look amazing and serious is that in all these years, that \"organization\" held nothing felt in the promotion and enhancement of the OTO in our country - quite the contrary. Evidenced by the \"marceliana organization based in São Paulo, became a factor of disintegration and misinformation regarding the OTO and Thelema. And this in every way imaginable.I am more than sure that my reaction to affirmative cause \"Thelemic imbalances\" and the members of the current leaders of SOTO. However, that is their problem. The only two options one being, of course, take his pants over his head or try to prove me wrong.Ask: to whom or what the Nuit Shop Work? (If it still works). Chance works in favor of Thelema? Works by chance rectum scope to improve one iota, the prevailing conditions of its members spiritually and materially speaking? Or on behalf of our country?Unfortunately, I think NOT be a response to these issues. And as much as I strive, I can not change your mind without feeling a liar. And as much as I strive, I can not shake the thought that the aforementioned Shop Nuit is gradually moving away from the original idea of our Founder.In a sense, I admit it, the SOTO has \"worked\" for the dissemination of the OTO, showing exactly what she is not. Undoubtedly a job. However, diametrically opposite to that desired and originally intuited by Our Great Organizer, when he said:\"The primary membership is not a great familiarity with books, but a heart anxious to promote the welfare of humanity, who are capable of experiencing love, that is, to realize the unity of God in all creatures\"Here we find, in a nutshell, but clearly, the Strength, Freedom, Love and Spiritual Depth of Our Order, forgotten by our brothers SOTO. And this forgetfulness, rather than the students will garner serious spiritual evolution, followed by material improvement, has them away, replacing them with elements completely incompatible with this original purpose: the inadequacies of the serious study and practice of Magick, and confused \" Do what thou wilt \"to\" Do what thou wilt. \" Put in other words: people mistaking Liberty and Love with riot and licentiousness.Unfortunately, this is not all. Discrepancies, visible intransigent positions adopted by the Members and dogmatism Store Nuit, compared to those who seek it in search of Knowledge and Wisdom Initiation, have"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"already become widely known as centers of repulsion and remoteness, proving once again to be that organization a total failure in the initiation process, ie a failure to become a Real Cell OTO in our country. So, of course, also failed to realize, in its real and deep meaning Our Motto. \"Do what thou wilt never meant any vulgarity as\" do what you will. \"Means, among other things,\" find your True Will. \"\" Do what thou wilt \"commands the water seeking its level, the ram to eat grass and wolves eat sheep, Lion roars and angry against those who wanted him mugisse.

Do what thou wilt means to be free and allow others also are.It also seems that the current members of the Lodge Nuit insist on demonstrating rudeness, aggressiveness free, rudeness to people, lack of tact and a growing estrangement that Balance featuring Started in Real Art. That balance established in Liber Librae - the first test that every Neophyte gets to enter the world of Thelema.\"Learn first - O you who aspire to join our Ancient Order! - Balance What is the basis of all work.\"Without this balance as the student may stabilize in the center of the Cross of the Elements? \"This Cross from whose center the Creative Word emerged at the dawn of the universe?\"However, not to be understood evils and interpretations truncated need to make clear that I do not deny and never denied the outstanding contribution of Mr. Marcelo Motta as a pioneer in the dissemination of Thelema in Brazil, and founding Store Nuit. To deny this would demonstrate a sepulchral blindness. And no one more than I know the ideals that animated the heart of that man. In the years we were together, I never saw measure efforts to carry forward the ideals Thelemic, which placed above any personal considerations, or to assist those seeking the Way and obviously those lined up beside her at the beginning of his career . It is, likewise, that these initial comrades gave their very lives for the sake of proper disclosure of Thelema and the launch of the bases of the first Lodge of OTO in Brazil.Of course, it does not deny the merits of the founders Store Nuit, which, by known, cheerfully sacrificed their possessions and their private lives in uplifting Store, for example, K. Frater Frater S., Soror S., Soror KA, and more.However, as stated above, Marcelo Motta changed their behavior to their \"followers\" initials. There was a \"detour\" in your path.Specifically in the year 1974 was quite adverse, with various disastrous events happening rapidly. Settled the discord in the original, and suspicion was quick to do their job destroyer. Came the schism. The first one. Many of the original seguidroes Marcelo Motta were subsequently \"expelled\" the organization's birth, for the most unreasonable reasons. Marcelo Motta become unrecognizable. There was, of course, the same man who conheceramos: become rough, contradictory in their actions and decisions minimal.Began a campaign of indiscriminate attacks on all who had helped him in his early work.Members of other branches of the Order, in many countries have become victims of their inexplicable hostility. He was hallucinating. In an increasing megalomania, Marcelo Motta, all accused of usurpers, traitors, thieves, etc.. And changing editorially works of Crowley used them to spread their sad persecution complex. Herein was instigated and supported by many \"vampires\" that incidiosamente penetrated in our circle.People, defamed him, had not, even the minimum rights of defense. He or \"other\") justified this behavior by stating that being the World Leader OTO was an autocrat. Many defamed, were already deceased, and other residents in distant countries. Á those of Brazil, also denied this right of defense. Absented herself from everyone. Even his closest followers he walked away, avoiding personal contact. I have heard, justified their behavior as a defense against the auric \"polluted\", and came to me for help. I could do nothing except recommend patience and calm, because he was certain that the man was no longer Marcelo Motta ... Thus, the first group was dismantled.Following these events, Marcelo Motta, managed to organize another group. But before long, a new wave of misunderstandings spread between these new \"students\". Most of its elements were also disenfranchised and unfairly denounced as wicked people brother, etc.. I was contacted by their leader. But, likewise, could do nothing - also had my problems and also involved in the roll out of the wicked people brothers. Besides, what right had I to intrude into orbit around other stars? Ali repeated the old story .. The same movie repeated two more times. Among these individuals, the ones who were suffering: Frater Lancelot (whom I knew personally becoming friends), Frater S. (Who died of grief) and Frater K. (With which correspondence kept for a long time). I'm not pitying these people do not. They had"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"what they deserved, as only \"slaves\" could withstand the controls and unmade Marcelo Motta that time.Few have not sensed the antagonism between Thelema and rambling tos Marcelo Motta, and his companion. But the fear that prevented them have been conditioned to assume the reality and thus to fight against it.But these \"students\" came later. And they know nothing of our lives and previous fights.From the time that we, the group's initial consciously integrated into the purposes and meanings of the OTO, we face the \"status quo\" effect: a scenario imposed by a military dictatorship, suspicious that throughout libertarian movement hid a finger communist.Many of us were arrested or persecuted, and some were exiled. Some others not withstanding pressure, mad and come to the other side, indulging in the clutches of \"Great Sorcery\", which clearly moved the strings behind the dictatorship. One of those \"turncoat\" stood out in society with his tricks, and today is much lauded for his books and interviews \"occult\" on television.As a legitimate member of the A. '. A.'., Marcelo Motta, trained serious students. I was one of them until 1975. But even in that Order Initiates did not escape the \"insane rage\" Marcelo, and it did not take too much to be blamed for failures in ordeals only existing in the tormented mind of our old instructor. The biggest mistake him regarding the A. '. A.'.was trying to accumulate all positions Officers of the Order (Preamonstrator, Imperator, Cancellarius) jettisoning continuously qualified candidates for the same.Marcelo Motta's paranoia grew and approximately in 1980, has become a dangerous man. Many of his students withdrew from active involvement with it, others retreated into silence, while others endured in vain hope of being able to reverse the situation. All useless. It was late. Later followed the footsteps of the previous.At this time, the controversial figure of Marcelo Motta could only raise unsuitable candidates for Initiation - OTO as much in the A. '. A.'. - Individuals visibly inclined to fanatical personality. Such behavior has reached such a point that, in England, one of these students plotted to blow up the library of famous and oldest British publishers (Routledge & Kegan Paul), simply because Marcelo Motta was \"bored\" with them. (This student wrongly nearly destroyed another bookstore. Sometime later died in prison.)All this chaotic picture represents a deplorable part of the legacy left by Marcelo Motta to various groups (currently degladiando up) which were formed from the self-proclaimed \"! OTO only true\", and that comes, thankfully, disappearing after the death of its founder.These remaining factions are led by fanatics and mentally incapable only met Marcelo Motta on their worst days.At one time he had highlighted their best side. I and others know it, and regret your change and, in consideration of the fact, we help students remaining few who remained faithful to Thelema, freeing themselves from the influence of the Old Instructor.But neither the OTO or A. '. A.'., Or the Order of Thelema, and neither the Occult in general may be liable for such events, or these ravings. And even Marcelo Motta can be pointed as the culprit. It is human nature the error. Especially at this stage of its evolution, the existence of the mistake, or get carried away by the illusion of an inflated ego is difficult to be avoided. I even find myself in this situation and I have been fighting the trend. It may seem paradoxical to the reader as superficial, Marcelo Motta, a legitimate member of the A. '. A.'., Has come to such a situation.It seems easy to explain. Just that we study the crucial points Career Initiation. Already added somewhere some clarification as to the, so called, Oath of the Abyss.Any man has a sacred right to take the Oath, which is the most serious in a career initiatory. Judging is done, anyone can try that Atravessia without actually is \"the point\" because. This is and will continue to happen to all that in a moment of their lives initiation, lose track perspective. The phenomenon is enabled by some vision or mystical-magical event that gives the false impression of having reached a certain high level within the hierarchy and, inadvertently, takes the Oath. We can not condemn anyone for this mistake. While on the one hand, take the Oath of the Abyss reveals an act of courage on the other, and on many occasions reveals an act of temerity poorly controlled. The problem becomes obvimente quite complex to be studied in detail here.But as written in Liber Librae: \"Be not hasty to condemn others, as you know if in their place, resistirias temptations? And even if thou wert stronger than them, because they despise those who are weaker than you? \" (This teaching should be followed to the letter, if we want to actually follow the correct path initiatory).The big problem contained in the Oath of the Abyss is explicit in LIBER samekh: \"... it remains inabsorvido one atom that is the false ego, that atom stain the virginity of the True Self, and profane the Oath, then that atom would be inflamed so by aproximaidade Angel would win the rest of the mind, tyrannize it"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"would, and become a mad despot. \"We can not lose sight of the correct disclosure of Thelema, covering up what really happened in Brazil. Even though the cause of distortion of Thelelma has had its origin in Marcelo Ramos Motta, or Euclydes Lacerda de Almeida, or any other. Hide the facts as they really occurred it would be unfair to those who gave so much of themselves in the early years, and even today, towards a broader knowledge of the man, and his real place in the context Universal. It will not be through lies and cover-ups that we will find the truth. It would also be unfair towards the memory of Marcelo Motta that during the period we were together, always showed himself a true man.Unfortunately for us, the current members of the Lodge Nuit persist in damnable and malicious smear campaign initiated years ago by the late \"General Overseer\" - a man who in his later years had obvious emotional imbalance, etc.. - Not only against persons belonging to other systems having nothing to do with ours, but also against Thelemites.Disagree with other system and Spiritual Attainment of people adopting is something quite different injures them, chase them and condemn them for this reason. True Thelemites never would take such a position. Quite the contrary. Thelemites struggle for the freedom of everyone to follow the path that leads to Will. But mind you: this Will is written with capital \"T\". There is no \"will\". Remind yourself constantly of Lemma Thelemic.The process used by the dealer Nuit against others and against other organizations is Thelemic, never will be, as shown by the acts and thoughts of those who in the past held the Sceptre and Crown of Leadership of Our Order.Not long ago, some of these individuals have questioned the authenticity of Our Brotherhood (I refer here to the SNAe.) As a genuine representative of the Sovereign Sanctuary of the Gnosis. No doubt this question is their right. Only disagree (which is our right) the way how he put it, the smear campaign used against the founders of SNAe ...And here we find the fixed idea I have been the single biggest factor in the failure of Marcelo Motta, frustrated in his attempt to realize his personal ambition to become the OHO of OTO, and be accepted as such by all branches the Order, and to present his \"organization\" under undisputed credibility as only true OTO worldwide.This is a mistake that they are members of Loj Nuit, have yet to overcome. I had nothing to do with that failure. Marcelo Motta simply fell into the net by Mrs. Germer and armed for their own mistakes (like many others are falling now) for his magalomania, and his illusion of being \"the only true Thelemite in the world)There are those unhappy with the failure of pseudo Marcelo.Na fact, Marcelo has not failed. He managed disclose Thelema between us Brazilians. Was not his fight, his boldness, we would not know of Thelema, or would know the wrong way through the FRA.Marcelo I just missed their personal views in the last years of his life. And this error we are all likely to fall.As for my interference in this process, there are many things to be clarified. For example: explain me, please like me, an initiate of much lower grade (or any grade as stated by many) from that of Marcelo Motta could \"take down\" an initiate of the Highest Degree as it was? Very incoherent the idea, is not it?Much has been said (and written) about my \"expulsion\" of the OTO (created by Marcelo Motta in 1975), which he emphatically called \"my OTO\". However, few have devoted themselves, even among \"initiates Store Nuit,\" a serious and impartial examination and analysis of events and facts that occurred at the time, as well as the sources from which emanated the news, it seems, is becoming become a legend in the various esoteric circles of the country.Although this legend has presented itself as a positive factor in the increase of people interested in SNAe, ie, its effect was opposite to that desired by the creators of the legend. And our members never wanted this kind of advertising, let alone me in becoming the focus of this legend with Marcelo Motta, or assume the position of leader of the OTO in Brazil. During all those years my only goal has been another addition to devote myself entirely to correct disclosure of Thelema, through the particular system of OTO, and have the necessary strength to bear the responsibility on the shouldersfrom my mistakes and successes - the curse inherent in every career initiatory. And in this way, do not accept compromise and fight I firmly any distortion of Thelema or any lie, no matter how small, wherever it comes from.I have observed throughout life, how easy and comfortable reprove people unfriendly to us, or that present themselves as adversaries to our ideas. This watch constantly in the news: an accumulation of failures, mutual accusations and name-calling between individuals and groups, whether political or"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"religious, or philosophical. Everyone wants to be the owners of the truth. The difficulty is finding retractions and apologies in the same proportion, when such accusations are proven entirely false. Until today SNAe has been stigmatized and fought without any basis to warrant suchposition and action, especially in relation to his work with the OTO. Within this context, I particularly, since I was even accused of \"black magician\" by various currents \"esoteric\", and even by some former disciples of Marcelo Motta. The most hilarious is that people, even, know the correct meaning of the epithet (for you to become a Black Magician, must at least attain the grade of Exempt Adept. A Degree extremely difficult to achieve. I'm just a neophyte .)Perhaps, people criticize and blame is the right of each. But to criticize and blame the people who \"heard\", or what they have read in publications spurious, or that said bars the corner without giving these people a chance of defending or tell his side of the story, makes was a despicable act must be fought by todoreais Thelemites or at least real men and women.Criticism, accusations and convictions, a priori, and personal touch, should be made only after full terms ed absolute certainty of the truth of them, and assumed responsibility for these charges. This should be at least the correct attitude of real men and women.Impresses us the amount of energy lost, every moment, with accusations, news malicious, ill-formulated explanations, hiding personal interests and talks badly routed. All this bringing serious damage (mental and moral) as to both defendants accusers. Best would be that such individuals ponder a little more and out instead of wasting valuable time and energy in discussions dnenhuma interest for this Order as a whole, canalizassem this energy and time effectively directed to work more and better disclosure of Thelema, our only respect.The following paragraphs are intended greater challenge, demonstrating extreme transparency with the evidence and facts, and scrutinize with extensive analysis, exploring the news and twisting facts and events that occurred a few years ago. The aim is not, of course, a literary publication, targeting large and public acclaim. Would be more specifically directed to the Brothers and Sisters of the Order, and other interested parties.Away from me, on its own initiative, the OTO, I am more at ease to write this work, excluding OTO, A. '. A.'. and SNAe any liability.\"Paradoxical as it may seem, all being spiritually free, is only due to slave testimony humanity, especially those who surround you, without which it is unworthy to have existed, this duty compels us to bear witness to those few who believe in us , accompanied us in difficult times, and when we were attacked in the most vicious untruth \" In 1976, Marcelo Motta in Brazil published its \"EQUIONÒCIO GODS\", Vol I N.1. In \"Final Note\" of that book (p.154) appears a informaçomm about Euclydes Lacerda de Almeida (Document on file with SNAe). Thus began the tribulations of him until today. And no voice rose to his defense. Never, at any time, Marcelo Motta and his followers gave him the sacred right of defense against the charges written there.Now, 11 years on, is the moment of response.Became general belief that Euclydes was expelled from the OTO , ie the branch created by Marcelo Motta. However, to the surprise of many in the \"Final Score\" inserted in \"The Equinox of the Gods\" was never written the word expelled, but suspended. And later it is said that \"before the suspension, Euclydes, obsessed ego resigned from the Order\" (which Order?). We challenge anyone to publicly show proof of this resignation, is theOTO , is the A. '. A.'., ie the same SNAe. - Simply because there was no such resignation.And never existed. Though not a scholar and connoisseur of the Portuguese language, gives to know that suspension is not the same as expulsion. Suspension means a disciplinary punishment, constituting a temporary removal of the offender so penalized. For this reason Marcelo himself says, in his letter, quoted above, that Euclydes be 'banned' the OTO for five years. For expulsion understands the compulsory removal and definitive, no chance of return, caused by serious crime.On the other hand, resign, translates a free act and willingly. Qualify this act as a sign of obsession is egoic second thought, go shallow and too far on a psychological analysis and even magical - especially when there was no such request."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Anyway, the less text, Euclydes ever been disbarred, but suspenso.É what is written and \"Final Note\", page 154, of \"The Equinox of the Gods\", Vol I N.1. In this same \"Final Note\", several questions remain \"in the air.\" First: Why the suspension? Very loosely there is claimed to have been for \"misconduct\", without determining what type of misconduct was this. Secondly: It is raw and cynically revealed that after resigning, Euclydes sought to connect to Kenneth Grant (well engrave this statement . will be of great importance for understanding the whole plot armed by Mr. Marcelo Motta), \"whose address was given him (the Euclydes naturally - Document on file with SNAe) as part of an ordeal.\" This was written in 1976.Third: Notification ends with serious indictment of Kenneth Grant, and Euclydes had used the \"documents or your property and even of his own.\" This, in good Portuguese simply means that Euclydes plagiarized writings of Marcelo Motta. Determining which documents they were like, and that was plagiarized is not said. In due course, both this issue, as the previous will be properly analyzed and understood, and everyone to decide whether or not the falsity of the statements. Observing closely the \"Final Note\", find other inacuridades. The most glaring one being induced in the text, the existence of a Lodge ofOTO trained and working in Brazil. Marcelo Motta induces this untruth readers.The truth is different: At the time (1975), there was a Lodge of OTO working in Brazil, even the supposed Branch subsequently created by Marcelo, much less one that would come much later under the name of S. OTO - acronym by which the \"organization marceliana\" became known after the events developed in the United States of America (Californian court). This acronym, S. OTO , was a device used in the California court to distinguish the OTO McMurtryana that Marcelo Motta. As for this acronym then do a series of observations under exclusive magical character. becomes evident to anyone starts, even in the humblest degree, that \"change\" the NAME of the Order, and consequently its acronym, profoundly alters the meaning hidden from the Original Name. The acronym OTO has a secret meaning for those who can read between the lines, and will not be any start, even those of high grades, which may change it to boost their particular interests. It is evident that any additions or deletion of a single letter change significantly the numerical value (Qabalistic, so to speak) and the corresponding magical sense.The best known example of this Qabalistic key found in the Old Testament, when \"God\" renames ABRM (Father of Elevation) for ABRHM (Father of Crowd) and SRI (nobility) to SRH (Princess) - see Genesis 17 . 5 -15. It was a big mistake magical Marcelo Motta have accepted the \"change\" the name of your organization. So he accepted magically pseuda authenticity of OTO McMurtryana. Elsewhere in this book will give some more information on the subject. Based on the foregoing in the previous chapter, we can give closed analysis as the \"Notification\" contained in \"The Equinox of the Gods.\" The conclusion being that Euclydes NEVER BEEN EXPELLED FROM OTO , but SUSPENDED THAT GOOD THING DIFFERENT Ò.However, we saw that even he could be suspended because it is impossible for anyone to be suspended or expelled, or even resign from an organization nonexistent. This simple and clear fact drops the \"Notification\" in \"FINAL SCORE\" the, so called, Equinox of the Gods - Vol I N.1. But we must go further in search of more evidence of untruths contained in ENDNOTE. Urge a comprehensive response and clear.After all were long years, during which a lie was offered to the public, as if it were true.Were long years of accusations and slanders the most unreasonable, directed not only against Euclydes, but also against many other, between the living and the dead. We eat the bitter fruit of the tree planted by Marcelo Motta. It's time for the watered swallow the crushed stone. Who care who have narrow canyon .. This is addressed to all those that connoisseurs of fact, remained hidden. They are now members of any Branches of OTO , or other organizations that emerged in the world, and saying Thelemic. Constitutes an act of justice, not revenge, a broad and definitive answer to the accusations against us, real initiators of the OTO in Brazil. Urge satisfaction to all brothers and sisters. Ò rightfully theirs, and ours, that everyone knows exactly what happened, and what happens with theOTO in Brazil.We need to go back and dig out the real motives of the \"expulsions sacramentadas\" here in our land. We (and this should have been done long ago) analyze the issue with all seriousness and attention it deserves, allowing nothing to pass blank. Remove the minimum questions, which may still remain in the minds and hearts of all those interested in Thelema in general and the OTO in particular - even if at times this analysis we have to expose our weaknesses and mistakes. Unfortunately for Members S. OTO , and members of many other organizations, said Thelemic, extensive documentation exists showing the reality of facts, ruse, of desecration and untruths that have been"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"perpetuated over the years. Lost in a monstrous megalomania, members of various OTOs. did not consider the fact that we, and others, we could build the pond which were launched and in clearing, coming forth as the Phoenix of legend. also serve as a warning to those who in the future, try another type of plot against Real Thelemites . Ò must all understand how far will the recklessness and irresponsibility of those who is saying Frati Superior, His eyes are., Caliphas, etc.., Try to deceive all those seeking a true initiatic Order.Consider, now, said on \"FINAL NOTE\": that the \"quit the Order\" (of which Order?) Euclydes \"sought connection with Kenneth Grant, whose address ... etc.., Etc..\" Euclydes sought not connect to Kenneth Grant (was not necessary: he had called to the English through Marcelo Motta, when, in a letter dated December 10, 1971, reads as follows: \"King World (or Outer Head) of OTO called Kenneth Grant and his address is ... \"In 1973, to give the Patent Grand Master of the First Three Degrees of the Order in Brazil, Marcelo confirms said earlier, and in the same year (May 19 ) categorically reaffirms the \"status\" of English: \"I recognized the authority of Mr. Grant.\"The \"story\" of the ordeal is an outright lie. One way to justify the 'suspension' of the Order Euclydes. Here an important question arises: What is the reason for this obsession Marcelo get rid of Euclydes (and others in the future?) The answer will become apparent in the course the following pages. Notice also that the 1971 letter addressed to Euclydes Lacerda, not Frater Zarathustra. Euclydes was at that time a mere interested in Thelema and OTO . What's this? Ò quite simple: You can not impose an ordeal about someone, even signed Oath. This is, no profane, that has not made a formal application for membership in the Order (in any order), and that has not signed the Oath, may be put on trial.This was the position Euclydes in 1971. He, like any other citizen, was solely exchanging correspondence with Marcelo Motta. And, as the latter had declared in 1964, does not have patent (or allowed) to work with the OTO , evidently sent its correspondent to Kenneth Grant. Now, if on the other hand, Marcelo Motta, knew Kenneth Grant Noo WAS Outer Head, and had been expelled from the Order in 1955, then Marcelo Motta made a great blasphemy against the Order and kept this blasphemy throughout time until 1975 , something we prefer not to believe. But if this is so - he knew the situation before the English Order - showed a monstrous lack of ethics and moral initiation. The inacuridades this man were not alone in this. Check that the letter, dated 1975, speaks to T. Frater, not to Frater Z.This is important because Frater T. had nothing to do with the OTO , or the SNAe. Frater T. was a brother of the A. '. A.'. and, as such, completely oblivious to the other Work Order. Another interesting failure Marcelo Motta he is on page 153 of the \"Final Note\" (Equinox of the Gods) declares that \"is responsible for the work of the OTO in Brazil, with PATENT SATURNUS X \".But that patent?There he claimed that such patent has never reached her hands? If he had it in his power, so he claimed the contrary? Why he never presented it?? On the same page (Endnote) it confirms that the United States \"Mr. Grady McMurtry is\" chief Store and received IX OTO directly BAPHOMET XI, having been confirmed by SATURNUS X. And also Mrs. Helen Smith ... \"It is more than clear that this was written in 1976, before Marcelo Motta to alienate these people. Sooner the breakup happened between them, he immediately ordered to suppress the book page where these statements that appeared at least give support to their prior allies, now enemies. And because of these \"accidents\" of life, page 153 is the other face of the sheet containing page 154, where to noticiava \" suspension \"of Euclydes.Conclusion: in the latest editions of \"The Equinox of the Gods\" the so-called \"expulsion\" disappeared along with the information of the expulsion and suspension of Kenneth Grant (1963) King Swiss Joseph Metzger. If readers have the opportunity to purchase \"THE EQUINOX\" Vol V No.4 (edited by Marcelo Motta in the United States of America in 1981) read the EDITORIAL. Ali again find the name of Lacerda Euclydes:\"Euclydes de Almeida: once the neophyte under Marcelo Motta. Charged Registering with the OTO in Brazil, tried to register it under his own name. Expelled from the OTO . got in touch with Kenneth Grant and tried to set himself up Representing the the same."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"A court order was issued: I did not try to appeal. Cut contact with the A. '. A.'. \" Never, at any time, Marcelo Motta, was so unhappy in his statements. Nothing written here corresponds to verdade.É pity that a book (693 pages) so well prepared, has been used to such huge untruths.1. Never, at any time, Euclydes tried to contact Kenneth Grant. He was already in contact with it through the very Marcelo Motta. 2. Euclydes ever tried to register the OTO on your behalf. He recorded the SNAe. which is the General Overseer until the present day (Document on file with SNAe). If he wanted to record the OTO , it would have been easy. Marcelo who is registered. 3. Euclydes ever tried to put yourself as a representative of Kenneth Grant. He played in Brazil for 15 years (Document on file with SNAe). 4. Never Euclydes resigned from the A. '. A.' .. While it is true that recently, in contact with Mr. Starr, this confirmed that the name Euclydes contained in the Chancellery of the Order. Editorial this finally appears the word \"expulsion\" (expelled) of OTO This is because, at the time Marcelo Motta had registered the Order in Brazil. Now yes, he could expel anyone who wanted. However, doing so fell into another paradox. How expel Euclydes S.OTO is Euclydes ever belonged to such an organization? Marcelo Motta: Some TestimonialsAs a legitimate member of the A. '. A.'., Marcelo Motta coached several students. Frater Aster was among them until the year 1975. But even started that Order did not escape the wrath of Marcelo unjustified, and it did not take too much to be blamed for failures in ordeals are existing in the mind of the instructor. A brilliant mind before, now tormented.His biggest mistake regarding the A. '. A.'. was trying to accumulate all positions Officers of the Order (Preamonstrator, Cancellarius, Imperator), combining continue being qualified candidates for the same. process of the bizarre transformation of Marcelo Motta and grew approximately in 1980, has become a dangerous man. Many of his students withdrew from active involvement with it, others retreated into silence, while others persisted in the vain hope of a change of the frame.All useless: they would then follow in the footsteps of previous. controversial figure at this time it could only raise unsuitable candidates for initiation in both the OTO as the A. '. A.' .. Individuals noticeably inclined to fanatical personality.Deviation reaching this point that, in England, one of them plotted to blow up the bookstore famous and oldest British publishers (Routledge & Kegan), Marcelo simply because he was \"bored\" with them. (This student wrongly nearly destroyed another bookstore. Prisoner, died shortly thereafter.) All this chaotic picture represents a deplorable part of the inheritance left Marcelo Motta for various groups (currently feuding) formed from the self proclaimed \"only true OTO\"and aggravating that comes after the death of its creator, led by incapable only met Marcelo Motta on their worst days.But neither the OTO or the Great Order, nor the Occult in general can be held responsible for these deviations. Even Motta can be presented as guilty. Ò of human nature the error.Especially at this stage of its evolution the existence of deception, or get carried away by the illusion of an inflamed ego, it is difficult to be avoided. There started to not run such a risk. In no order or system it will be protected from such danger intrinsic to the nature of Initiation. It may seem paradoxical to the reader as Marcelo Motta, a legitimate member of the A. '. A.'., Has come to such a situation.There are two plausible explanations. suffices to study the crucial points Career Initiation, particularly the Oath of the Abyss. Any man or woman has the right to take this sacred oath, which is the most serious of all initiatory career. The student, judging yourself ready, you can try that without actually crossing is the \"point\" due. Ò an illusion that the ego takes assault. This is and will continue to happen to all that in a moment of their lives initiation, lose their sense of perspective. The phenomenon is enabled by some \"vision\" or \"event\" mystical-magical that gives students the false impression of having reached a certain high level within the hierarchy. So he inadvertently takes the Oath. One can not condemn him for such a mistake. While on one hand the taking of the Oath of the Abyss reveals an act of courage on the other, on many occasions, reveals an act of recklessness. The problem becomes too complex to be explored here satisfactorily. But as written in Liber Librae:"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"\"Be not hasty to condemn others, how to tell if you place them in resistirias temptation? And even if you were stronger than them, because they despise those who are weaker than you?\"This teaching must be strictly observed by those who want to properly follow the Path of Initiation. The big problem contained in the Oath of the Abyss Liber Samech is explicit: \"... it remains inabsorvido one atom that is the false ego, that atom stain the virginity of the True Self, and profane the Oath, then that atom would be inflamed so by the closeness of the Angel would win the rest of the mind, bullying her, and become a mad despot \" We can not lose sight of the correct disclosure of Thelema, covering up what actually happened in Brazil. Even though the cause of this distortion has had its origin in Marcelo Motta, A. Frater or in or on any other. Hide the truth of the facts as they really happened would be unfair to those who gave so much of themselves in the early years, or even today, towards a broader knowledge of the nature of man and his place in the universal context.Disagree with the other systems and Spiritual Attainment of the people who adopt them is something quite different from injures them and condemn them for this reason. True Thelemites never would take such a position ... unless they are insane or deluded by egos. Thelemites struggle for the freedom of everyone to follow the path that his will to command. But notice that this Will is written with capital \"T\". remember the Thelemic motto. But we also reserve the right to fight any kind of trickery, deceit, malice, etc.., Because there are things that a true will want. Frater A. has been questioned, particularly by these disciples of late Marcelo Motta transformed, as to the authenticity of SNAe. as a genuine representative of the Sovereign Sanctuary of the Gnosis. No doubt it is their right so questioning. However, they are based on the idea of being Frater A. directly responsible for the failure of single and Motta in his failed attempt to realize his personal ambition to behold up OHO of the Order. Now we ask: how could Frater A. affect you if Frater A. belonged to a degree vastly lower that of Marcelo Motta?Finally, it is our duty to warn least clarified the existence of two types of Abyss.And it is very easy to confuse one with the other. What do you think is the Veil Paroketh? There is a \"passage\" between the four lower Sephiroth (Malkuth, Hod, Yesod and Netzach) called \"Paroketh Veil\" (The Veil of the Temple). This gap \"separates\" these four Sephiroth of Tiphareth (Beauty). This veil also represents an \"Abyss\". Only scale 'inferior'. Many started confused this \"Abyss\" with ABYSS OF DAATH. Our Sister Helen account on these numbers. SOCIETY AND STORE NEW AEON NUIT A post separation Marcelo Motta and Euclydes, the latter decided, along with his wife and members who remained faithful to his side, record the SOCIETY NEW AEON. Then devoted to the elaboration of a disclosure of Thelema.But a rather distanced system hyper orthodox old instructor. Under this new system - and consequently the OTO - not estruturalizou in a hierarchy and oppressive power of the \"male\". This would be a setback. And those who, in one way or another, trying to present the order with a power structure organized and obsessed with total and absolute control of the body, mind and soul of its members (whether male or female), are leading the Order, and themselves, the opposite way to Thelema. The OTO has nothing to do with this monster created by leaders Store Nuit, nor with no less Thelemic policy adopted by other branches around the world. Because if the OTO embark on such a path is frankly returning to the same process that gave rise to Nazism. The OTO is (or should be, in all its branches) a Center Initiation, in which freedom of expression is considered sacred, and its main function is to awaken in people the awareness that they are divine.Thelema is affirmation of Life, Love, Mother Earth and Freedom - not Death. Thus, the efforts of the newly formed group headed towards submit an order within the parameters of Liber OZ, but with extreme care not to fall into the hype of those who misperceive the dictates described therein. Liber Oz is a book that should be read and understood \"iniciaticamente\", not profanely as it has been until now. In a short period appeared enthusiastic employees for the joy of work towards Thelema, ie, in favor of the Will, Freedom and Love - who are the Three Pillars Sustaining Life. Now, an organization supported were well founded, and from the point of view of material, legally registered in the country. An organization genuinely Brazilian. The motto of this group, added to that emanated directly from Thelema, was the apparent paradox of Count Fenix:\"The absolute authority of the state should be the function of the absolute liberty of each individual will.\""},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Listen to those who have ears to hear ... In a next step contacted Kenneth Grant who, after all, was the only member of the OTO known to them beyond Marcelo Motta. A long letter was written to the English reporting with minimal details, the latest occurrences in Brazil.On June 26, 1975 (Document on file with SNAe) came the reply. 's letter to Kenneth Grant, among other things, comments about bringing charges of Marcelo Motta in \"Equinox of the Gods\" - a copy had been sent. After a relatively short period of constant correspondence with England, agreed to formalize a link between SNAe. and the Supreme Sanctuary of the Gnosis to England.In the embodiment of this alliance, Kenneth Grant, sent Patent Honorary Member of the VII to Euclydes Lacerda de Almeida (Document on file with SNAe) and published in \"Mezla\" (Official Organ Disclosure of OTO English) Vol I N.11 - 1977 --- Notification of union between the two organizations (Document on file with SNAe.) The initial group consisted of eighteen individuals, including three maçomns high grade and two members of the previous group, who decided to stay with Euclydes. Adjusted the points needed, Kenneth Grant, Euclydes placed directly under the hierarchy of initiatory Soror Tanith (JR Ayers), leader of the OTO English in the United States of America.It is with great affection and respect that Euclydes talks about this instructor. For ten consecutive years, he corresponded with Soro Tanith, absorbing all teaching that Started. In 1987 received notification that one instructor had moved away from the External Work Order. Soror MAIAT replaced it. Under the direction of this new guideline, and after overcoming one very difficult and painful ordeal - about which you do not like to comment, hit the IX ° OTO - although, Marcelo Motta, have you been no broadcast the Secret Central Order via oral teachings and \"BADGES AND WAY TO USE\" Liber which is one of the most important mms. of OTO related Grade IX. yet received in 1987 Kenneth Grant, with the approval of the Supreme Sanctuary, permission to use the Lamen of the Order. But never used in connection with SNAe., For which we designed a Lamen own (Document on file with SNAe).Previously, these events received a letter rather puzzling and surprising coming Oséas de Almeida, one of those who stood by Marcelo Motta during the schism. Marcelo and Hosea had initiated a core of OTO in the City of São Paulo. Hosea assumed the post of Master of the Lodge, supervised by Marcelo Motta. In this first letter, Hosea asked for help, pure and simple. Probed the possibility of allying with Euclydes in obvious conflict with Marcelo Motta (Document on file with SNA). Euclydes answered him not be interested. Had nothing to do with the group of Sao Paulo. Not fed any feelings of revenge. However, the union of the two groups, ie SNAe. FAA and the OTO (the name given to the organization of São Paulo) was not feasible for obvious reasons.In a second letter, dated July 24, 1977, Hosea summarizes the unpleasant friction between him and General Supervisor. The text of this letter will be more eloquent than a thousand words our (see documentation). Patiently explained the Euclydes Hosea, again, the unfeasibility of this union: had nothing to do with the system developed by Marcelo Motta disclosure of Thelema in Brazil - a highly questionable, inappropriate, aggressive, with tend6encias clearly Nazis - impossible if followed by anyone balanced. Sorry but could do nothing to help Hosea. Later Euclydes, learned of the lawsuit filed by Marcelo against Hosea. In this case the problem of protruding \"copyright\" on the name OTO After this incident, Euclydes, never had any contact with Hosea, or any other member of the FAA OTO Recently (1997), through Mr. Walter Junior Antonio Sena (Toninho Buda), learned of the death of Hosea. Long before these events (1976) Marcelo Motta gathered in Ribeirão Preto (SP), and in default of Hosea, a Rose group. With this new auxiliary, and Hosea away, eventually founded a store in 1979 under the name Shop Nuit, which, unfortunately, has become well known in the media Thelemic by intransigent attitudes, aggressive and uneducated its components. \"The Shop Nuit continues ...The shop consists of addicts, unemployed, and all kind of young man in freedom (in terms) that give them out there, all ready .. I only regret that my city, still harbors this scum. \"(Frater Kephra.) The loss process with McMurtry, and other documents, the skilled Supervisor took with him. Deleted all the clues.

According to these, the letters responses to their requests for more details about the Lodge or on Thelema were true heaps of rubbish, aggressiveness, etc.. These letters never came signed. Always accused applicants \"agents\" of the CIA, FBI, the Vatican and, amazingly, the Euclydes Lacerda, as if it were able to maintain an intelligence agency. This whole situation caused enough grief in Euclydes.His former trainer had become a man without any kind of balance. Dangerous, in the words of a few. He tried to defend Marcelo, but the evidence was too clear. When it seemed, Marcelo, had fallen under the control of some evil entity, perhaps, who knows, by Samael (The False Accuser), the Qlipha Hod, or Ogiel (Arbitrariness) the Qlipha Chokmah. All the news that reached him concerning his instructor were of the same tenor. This policy incomprehensible Store Nuit drove away interested in Thelema in general and the OTO in particular, rather than attract them. Later found an interesting fact: without exception all those who linked to Marcelo, occupied the post of Master of the Lodge, were execrated and expelled the \"order\" for the same reasons, starting with Frater Kephra, founder and funder of Store Nuit . Frater Saladin, in the same way and died of grief shortly after his expulsion. Frater Pound also expelled under the basest accusations. And so on. Same occurring in the United States and in England, where there were other shops linked to Marcelo.In 1988 (April 12), Euclydes, learned of the death of Marcelo Motta. A priori disbelief in the news. Requested information to Mr. Alcaeus. This sent xerox copy of the official notice of the Society Ordo Templi Orientis International. Surprised you the detail that the warning came from the United States. (Box 18318 Washington, DC 20036 USA) and was signed by a man named Daniel B. Stone (Document on file with SNAe).Intrigued, I asked Mr. Eduardo Lemos (one of his correspondents) who wrote about the \"trustee\". Response received July 5, 1988. Wrote a second letter. The answer came on August 8, 1988. And one more in 1991, when inquired about Nuit Store in Brazil and the Foundation Parzival XI in Australia.Through this third letter noted that the groups formed by Marcelo, both in the USA and in Brazil had been divided. As we can see, power struggles continued in all the branches ofOTO But we must now return a few years ago. More precisely 1978. This year, Euclydes, was residing in the city of Linhares (state of Espírito Santo), to monitor the construction of a maritime terminal in the region. He remained there until 1985, returning to Rio de Janeiro. This phase behaves very important facts because she moved away during any activity in SNAe. The components of the initial group each took their own path, and SNAe.entered a phase of dormancy.It was at this time that Euclydes reached the most important trance of their mystical and magical practices in the curriculum of the A. '. A.'., Except that occurred in 1973. trance The result of this was the birth of two books: \"MY TRUE NAME \"and\" BLACK GODDESS \"(Ed. Bhavani.) On returning to Rio de Janeiro, still worked until 1985, when he retired. Now he had all his time available to devote himself entirely to the work of dissemination of Thelema. Just needed to rebuild SNAe .. What was done with the aid of Mr. Carlos Raposo, the most devoted companion and brother of all others. Time passed. One day was informed by Mr. Marcelo Motta Lassue that had been in his library (Library Lassue), and it seemed, according to that bookseller poor health.Speaking with Mr. Geraldo dos Santos (Frater Lancelot) regarding this confirmed the news. Marcelo to return to Brazil after the incidents in the United States, had fallen ill.Sincerely concerned about the health of his former teacher, he volunteered to go to Ribeirao Preto in order to help Marcelo what was needed. Gerard warned what might be poorly received by staff Store Nuit practically hated Euclydes. \"It does not matter\" - was his answer.\"The important thing was to revise his former instructor and help him in that crisis.\" In Ribeirão Preto were greeted by Frater Pound, which reported to be impossible to contact Marcelo. He had traveled, etc.. Realizing lies and excuses the man's words, Euclydes, decided to take action magic to test the level of such initiatory Frater Libra. He had brought with them their Patents the VII and IX ° of OTO English. And a voice command feature to that Frater peremptorily ordered him to take photocopies of documents and deliver to Marcelo. The man who said he was Master of the Lodge accepted the command without"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"hesitation. So Euclydes, realized that the front was not started at all, but a slave.Lancelot looked meaningfully at Frater and getting back the original Patent thence departed on the first bus back to Rio I had nothing to do in that den of pestilence and slavery.Continued his work, now aided by various stakeholders. A procedure some initiation using rituals which it produced. Shared responsibilities with Frater B. and conveyed to him the Secret of the IX °. There is great curiosity about this \"secret\". But everyone knows that it is as simple as adding an account. Hard to believe, when we discover, so be it. At the ceremony of the Catholic Mass is it contained. It is veiled the mystery that very few know. Even the priests. Even people understand that the Mystery of the Mass, the Real Secret of the Ancient and Accepted Masons, Knights Templar, and of the true Rosicrucians, is one and the same. The Mystery of the Mass, the Knights Templar and the Royal Neo-Christians, lies in Communion with God whose symbolic Fire Mass describes in his drama. The statements and explanations that the Roman Church provides, as regards the essence of the Mystery of the Mass are intentionally incorrect because the ecclesiastical authorities in the Vatican know the real nature of it and its true meaning.The priests of the lowest levels within the Vatican hierarchy, are however, for official reasons, left completely in the dark regarding the real nature of this. But those who have eyes to see, understand the mysterious Secret Central OTO which is, as already said, of the same mation, the Rosicrucians and the Templars.- Meeting with Thelema -On August 26, 1987, died in the city of Teresopolis, State of Rio de Janeiro, the 53-year-old Marcelo Ramos Motta, better known as Frater Parzival XI. * 1 His death was \"celebrated\" by disciples, and the disciples former enemies .... each in his own way. Who was Marcelo Ramos Motta? For this man became so controversial in the circles of the occult world in general and in particular the world Thelemic? Why was it so talked about, hated, loved and, above all, feared? try to answer all these questions in the most impartial vision possible. But be warned the reader that nothing is as difficult as this man speak, let alone tell his attainments mystical, magical and your goals .. Marcelo Motta was born on June 27, 1931, in the City of Rio de Janeiro. His interest in the occult began early. At 11 years of age he studied the books of Eliphas Levi, Papus, Blavatsky, Edward Bulwer-Lynton, Patanjali, Paracelsus and the works of Arnold Krumm-Heller, fed by those great admiration. Therefore, attention was focused constantly to the mysterious \"Rosicrucians\", in which dedicated pesquiza deeply. Later, he contacted the books of Max Heindel, RS Clymer and eventually with the organization called AMORC, for which, by the way, has developed a true aversion * 2.Cherished the hope of being admitted to a school initiation, similar to that described by Arnold Krumm-Heller in the novel \"ROSE-CROSS\", and Bulwer-Lynton on \"ZANONI\". At the same time developed remarkable aversion to Roman Catholic Christianity, which he defined as \"the very embodiment of denial of the will to live\", because when Marcelo Motta saw the real meaning of Christianity in the Roman world, the spirit of the \"anti-Christ\" manifested with surprising strength in the course of his life and work * 3.His \"LETTER TO A MASON\" became classic in this regard and should be studied by all beginners to the SYSTEM Thelemic and, of course, for mation. At that time, according to his words, realized that the \"knowledge\" contained in the esoteric works (the most serious) had studied, hid something much deeper than is commonly believed to exist. And in search of this knowledge \"hidden\" behind the Occult, became a focus of willpower almost superhuman. Day by day, during his youth, Marcelo Motta, had concentrated all his energy, intelligence and power of meditation in search of this knowledge \"Rosicrucian\".The search led to the highest levels of the Great Order. Joining the Military School of Rio de Janeiro * 4, developed his intellect, discipline and acquired a great love for Brazil. By this time showed great interest in Astrology, Tarot and related matters. Therefore the focus of many discussions among their schoolmates and teachers. His discussions with Professor of Philosophy, MH, were commented for several years among the students of CM An increasing myopia prevented his entrance into the School of Aeronautics. This made him give up the military career, even in other weapons, which caused him great grief. * 5 At thirteen years of age he devoted himself spontaneously to the Service of Humanity."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Throughout your life For we must consider that the vote was accepted by the Lords of Karma. Completing 17 years of age, he knew, through his mother, the existence of the FRA, an array of high-level Masonic founded by Arnold Krumm-Heller. It began in the FRA on August 19, 1948. * 6 After attending the FRA for some time, and quickly climb the three degrees of the Order, Marcelo, moved away from the work in store. When you turn 20 years old, his family friction grew alarmingly * 7. He struggled against the domination of his mother, who opposed his will violently.Reaching a point excruciating, decided to leave Brazil going to Europe and from there to the United States of America (1952) where he would end his English studies at a college north American. On this trip had with him, at the request of the Commander of the FRA Brazilian mission to mediate between this and PARZIVAL KRUMM-HELLER (son of Arnold Krumm-Heller), legal substitute the deceased Krumm-Heller in FRA. * 8 In Europe (Portugal) , he first learns of Thelema, by the book 'THE GREAT BEAST, \"a partial biography written by Aleister Crowley J.Symonds. remember, then, that in the First Degree of the FRA \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law \"was part of the Initiation Ritual. This much intrigue as the FRA had never heard of Crowley or even the Master Therion. But while reading the book, raises doubts about the conditions initiatory Crowley that, at first glance, it seemed to be a Satanist of the worst kind.Finding himself with Parzival Krumm-Heller, following his mission FRA Brazilian Ambassador, asks about such Aleister Crowley. Parzival, very gently, gives the necessary and basic knowledge about the subject, changing entirely the thought rushed prioriístico and Marcelo Motta about Crowley. It was then that Parzival shows him a letter of \"Outer Head of the OTO \", addressed to Arnold Krumm-Heller, warning him Clymer, whom Dr. Arnold Krumm-Heller linking this to the time of the letter, instrument was the most sinister forces. At that time, Marcelo Motta, even knew what it meant OTO . For better understanding of the reader on the subject, we open a parenthesis here for quick explanation: (According to the version of the FRA Brazilian leader, Dr. Krumm-Heller, before he died, tried to unite the FRA and ROSICRUCIAN FRATERNITY IN AMERICA \"* 9, whose leader was then RSClymer.But the first step of Parzival Krumm-Heller, to assume leadership of the FRA, was ordering the shutdown of its Order that Clymer. And a letter to this effect was sent to the Leader of the Brazilian FRA. This considered the letter of Parzival Krumm-Heller too authoritarian and peremptory. With this was evident the breach between Parzival Krumm-Heller and Commander of the FRA in Brazil.) Now we observe the facts \"by far\" we see as \"the hand of fate,\" or that of \"the Secret\", weave the pathways leading the student to meet their real aspirations. There was a request from the leader of the FRA Brazilian Marcelo Motta would never have reached the Thelemic system. At least at the time. Parzival Krumm-Heller, after hearing the message that Marcelo brought him the leader of the FRA in Brazil, gave his views on the subject:According to him, Clymer (the \"pivot\" of every problem) had contacted Arnold Krumm-Heller when he was already ill, aged and disgusted, dejected by political persecution, both the Nazis and later the Allies after World War II World. It was at this time that Clymer tried so Dr. Arnold Krumm-Heller with that eternally appetizing bait for profane and started to lower grades: the idea of unification of all orders under an initiatory order only powerful and well-fazeja. Unfortunately, Arnold Krumm-Heller had fallen into deception. Therefore, the leader of the FRA in Brazil received instructions to connect to Clymer. At this time Parzival Krumm-Heller was in Egypt conducting personal research on certain magical formulas. Not much later, the very Arnoldo Krumm-Heller admitted that the purpose of Clymer were not what he thought. * 10 was Parzival Krumm-Heller who formed the link between Marcelo Motta and Karl Germer (Frater Saturnus), then the OHO OTO"}]
