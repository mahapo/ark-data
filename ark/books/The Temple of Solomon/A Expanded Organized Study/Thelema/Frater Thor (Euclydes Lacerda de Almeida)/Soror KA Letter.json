[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"LETTER FROM SOROR KALI ATHENA (Claudia Canuto de Menzes) Dear Mr. S.Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the LawGet first cordial greetings and recognition for its strange because the parrots and the losers who go around. Let me ask absolute confidentiality of this correspondence, which will be good for all of us. Outside has every kind of cowardly, envious, lazy, who prefers to take life (life?) Looking for reasons to curse others, even I do not use my legal name but with my name in the External there are people who know who logo writes, and honestly do not even want to know where I am. Please respect this request.Met Marcelo Ramos Motta in the late 70s and remained at his side until the time of his last rapture. But Marcelo died bitter and doubtful about the correctness of their work. He did not know if the steps that had been given in the right way, did not know if he had honored his instructor, Frater SATURNUS IX and X º º, whom he succeeded as head of OTOI saw, I saw Frater PARZIVAL XI thereof, Outer Head pointed by Frater SATURNUS Xthagainst their will and inclination (this was in the A. ·. A. ·. , not OTO) being humiliated, betrayed, shattered. I hate corroded, while he quietly took advantage of the acid to eat away at your enemies instead of your own and put down his flag ANGEL CITY on PYRAMIDS.I saw the enemy coming from behind our own columns, seen hugging traitors with a dagger lies and hatred. Hate the man, whose image outshone that of Initiate, the black aura seen by those who have no eyes to see. I saw all this, a whole story, but I could not understand. I could not understand but now I hear the voice of Adonai all seems clear.Hear then you try and understand.One of the few people who prided Marcelo Ramos Motta was someone known as FRATER ZARATUSTRA the OTO and how Frater THOR in A. ·. A. ·. (I know you know who I'm talking about, but I prefer to refer to it this way, out of respect to the fact it was my first instructor). A few months before his death showed me that ZARATUSTRA had been trained as a soldier and a soldier who only know how to lead the troops when it became coron el (for Marcelo course there would be another general but himself, do not ask too much!). So he knew that even if the OTO would fail someone who would not let the torch go out. For Marcelo there was no reason to create a dependency relationship, things were as they should be. For him, Frater ZARATUSTRA was in combat and \"As brothers fight ye\". Note this is very important for y ou understand what was going on in the head of Marcelo Ramos Motta, the master disappears when the disciple is ready.It was a confidence that he has appointed Ray Eales to raise another order because the battlefield was also undermined the OTO too. If you say this is because I know that there are people who are intending to resurrect an undesirable situation. If everyone wanted to be Marcelo, he wanted everyone to open their eyes and see that they were not and should not try to be Marcelo Ramos Motta. And almost all failed in this ordeal, see the monkeys speakers that are out there, all imitating today (actually trying to imitate) the style of Marcelo Ramos Motta, without understanding that he had reason behind all the acts he practiced, he wanted strengthen the strong and the weak down, in his own way and for his reasons.And today people (?) That even knew superficially are trying to cause even more pain that was caused, people (?) Who want to take advantage of the lack of understanding of the talking apes to try to demoralize ZARATUSTRA Frater and others, without understanding that they had a special function plotted for something beyond what we understand others, and Marcelo Ramos Motta was able to understand and drive. Anyway, my friend, I see that these people do not want nothing to compromise the work's own Marcelo Ramos Motta, or what little there is left of it, after being plundered and trampled.But remember that we somes few and so unknown. This is not about hiding our work but that these talking monkeys will never know EXACTLY what we're talking about, even if they speak Portuguese in good and paused. Maybe people wonder why no one was appointed to head the Society Ordo Templi Orientis by Canuto, Stone and Barden (the latter soon wanted to get their hands in the Company, without caring what others thought): I say, because no one was suitable for this. For this reason and for this reason alone. I know very well what I mean, one day you will understand."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"That wound is healed in me, that those who remained loyal to Thelema are more valuable than those who despise the work with words of flattery. But there are people who want to safeguard their own open (?) And petty interests.Anyway be careful and be ready to fight and defend what you hold dear. That's exactly what Marcelo Ramos Motta made until the end of life, but few understood.Be prudent and keep quiet about this correspondence, I ask again. If I can trust you, maybe one day we'll meet everyone. Then you will know who I am and understand exactly what I mean.Love is the law, love under will.Soror KA .October 2000 ev"}]
