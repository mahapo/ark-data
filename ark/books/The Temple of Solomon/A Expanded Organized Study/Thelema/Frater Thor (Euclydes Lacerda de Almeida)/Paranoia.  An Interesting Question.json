[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Paranoia: An Interesting Question.(That dear reader forgive me if, rather than distract you, I force him to think and put some \"worms\" in your head ) Part I In the 60s, my most beautiful conceptions of God, Man and the Universe have been turned upside down. Old beliefs were replaced by new, vibrant and dynamic vision - a comprehensive view of the Thelemic system.In subsequent years through this new perspective of the world, I realized clearly that much of the Official Story (so defined by pure convention) of the human race, that we learned in the schools, or was pure fabrication or served to veil the facts that should not be known to us. As what, or who, secretly wants to keep us in ignorance of these facts, through millennial \"sleight of hand\", will be discussed in another paper in the future.That all our social history, politics, anthropology and religious were a basis of false premises incultadas in our minds for centuries is now clearly visible to me, but also for others. I am not left any doubt that almost all of the \"historical facts\" and \"characters\" associated with them, especially in Tangent religions and our roots are imaginary, distorted or grossly exaggerated in order to provide support for affirmative accepted by most people as unshakable truths. That most of us have been constantly pressured to believe in fables woven true to the flavor of diabolical minds, is more than proven. No longer is no secret that most of us are constantly pressured by changes in behavior will inductions in many quarters. We are tempted daily to spend our meager money (earned by the sweat of our work) in buying trinkets, only because the subliminal television advertisements lead us to it. As citizens, we are persuaded to açulados toward certain points of view, by politicians fighting to gain power over our lives and profit to their pockets. In the case of religions are led to fanaticism, so that we become faithful and obedient slaves. All these \"commands\" are extremely subtle and invisible to the conscious mind.Most humans - especially in our society controlled by the media - is unaware of skillful strategies used to direct our destinies. Our lives are full of scams and lies masquerading as truth. Popularly it is still nourished the illusion that we are masters of our fate, we are free, that each one of us and owned his own nose, his innermost thoughts, ethical values and social behavior. The truth is quite different from that. The chances of getting rid of this hole we're in seems to me less and less.The work presented here is not entirely mine. Is an amalgam, a synthesis, so to speak of renowned authors such as Robert Anton Wilson, Michael Baigent, Ricrahd Leigh, Henry Lincoln, Timothy Leary and many others. Researchers knew that look and analyze, in the purest neutrality, the various mysteries and paradoxes constant in our history where subterfuge, masks unspeakable conspiracies and political-social-religious evolve outside the general knowledge.I do not say that as many researchers have not reached the same conclusions, however they were silent for fear of the consequences or the \"open game\" or some particular interest. Unfortunately this has happened in all branches of knowledge.For a long time I have asked several people about the subject. Almost all of them trying to do is desentendida. And what is worse, away from him, claiming to be too complex or doubtful and, and some cases, pure imagination. However, few take the issue seriously.In the latter group was Marcelo Ramos Motta - the pioneer of Thelema in Brazil - whose words and warnings have been ignored and even ironizadas by morons if saying \"Thelemites\" and accusing the fanatical, paranoid and other things with regard alerts to the dangers of a large and constant conspiracy threatening us all. Conspiracy from remote dates, being manipulated by a single source: one that seeks, in one way or another, using any methods, even the most heinous, destroy our individual and collective freedom.I do not claim that the entire web of intrigue conspiracy were easily assimilated by me.For a long time, many doubts assailed me. However, over time and through various personal experiences, sure desets facts materialized in my mind, taking shape and consistency. I can now say as The Wizard of Oz: \"Take care of what is behind the curtain.\"There are times that I think is waste of time to write about it. Many people do not give a damn about"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"him. Or will they give, but pretend not to? Anyway, all claim to be mere fantasy. Think the world is so somplório as dedicated their lives from birth to death, chasing after the \"financial and social success\" - to \"appear\" as popularly said, while the really important things, which are even suspicious. Little do they know that this position - the position of the ostrich - is exactly that which the weavers of conspiracy seeking to deploy in all humans. So it is easier to master them and scravizá them. This makes it easier to turn them into \"canaries trapped in a golden cage.\" That they are, so enraptured with the life they lead. If this is Life. \"The slaves shall serve.\"I know that everyone has the sacred right to live \"their lives\" as they wish. Even being slaves. But anyway, I feel the inner urge to warn them of their danger, of what is really happening on our planet. And, besides, I have the right not to reincarnate me into a world of slaves when back here.Now if they will pay or not enough attention to what I say, it's their problem. Days will come when they will regret having been so careless regarding their current and future lives, for the lives of their grandchildren, etc..Although it is said that we (us and them) inspired by the same ideals, which have the same Master, we studied the same book and we honor them Oaths of course it does not match the truth, but half the truth, because separates in an important quality, namely: the courage to live what we learn with our Master, with our Book and our system and it has great quality and weight will make the big difference between us and them, the Balance of Maat. Part II A few years ago, the newspapers of the world reported a scandal involving the Vatican, the Freemasons, the Mafia, the CIA, the Banco Ambrosiano and the Order of the Knights of Malta. Entered into this scandal also appeared the names of prominent people in the world FINANCIAL: Licio Gelli, Roberto Calvi, Michael Sindona, Archbishop Paul Marcinkus and others who appear in this paper.In 1982 (the very day June 18) Mr. Roberto Calvi was found hanged in Blackfriars Bridge (London). The lifeless body was covered by the tide. Like all devems aber, Roberto Calvi was training and belonged to a high degree of order. As everyone should also know these times, there is a serious oath in Freemasonry. This oath is accepted by future training during the ritual of the First Degree. Oath says that the training at any time, betray the Order or their \"brothers\", he will be \"persecuted, hanged where the tide will cover your body.\" Mation Some say this is just ritualistic death and therefore should not be taken literally.In fact, people in general, it seemed perfectly clear that Alberto Calvi had been killed by the information, or by \"people wanting us to believe it.\" At the time of his death, Calvi had left hurriedly in Italy where he was cornered in various scams.In 1970, Gelli and his companions of the Order of Malta, Michel (The Shark) Sindona, took control of the finances of the Vatican with the connivance of Bishop Paul (The Gorilla) Marcinkus (the nickname \"Gorilla\" refers to your anatomy. Marcinkus served as a bodyguard for two Popes). Paul was manager of the Vatican Bank and other bank founded in the Bahamas, called Cisalpine Bank, which managed along with the late Roberto Calvi.As Chairman of Banco Ambrosiano, this training was one of the main directors of the financial transactions of the Vatican, because the symbiosis between Banco Ambrosiano and the Vatican Bank (IOR); maneuvers and fraud put in charge of the Vatican hundreds of millions of dollars.Clara Calvi, wife of Roberto Calvi, constantly asserted that \"senior representatives of the Vatican\" ordered the murder of her husband. But this statement was widely refuted by Stephen Knight, British journalist, writing in \"The Brotherhood\" (The Brotherhood) to Calvi certainly been killed by their \"brothers tion\" to the famous P2 Lodge (Propaganda Due).Mation as all know, the \"P2 Lodge\" was not really a Masonic lodge, but positively one of the many traps created and financed by the Roman Church to deceive unwary. Just like the various \"initiatic orders\" existing for this \"world of God\". In short, the death of this \"training banker\" has not hitherto been adequately clarified.The P2 Lodge (which belonged Roberto Calvi) has been widely investigated by Italian magistrates, was accused of various financial fraud, money laundering of Mafia, numerous agents to infiltrate the Italian government and conspiring to install a fascist government in Italy through a coup."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"There is also clear evidence that the P2 Lodge is the source of finaciamento dictatorial regimes in Latin America and have helped the dyke several Nazi war criminals, including the notorious Klaus Barbie. These criminals were held with Bank funds.Was Grand Master of the lodge P2 Mr Licio Gelli, had also as senior member of the Grand Orient of Egyptian Freemasonry (information we doubt). This gentleman is now recognized, was not only Grand Master of the lodge P2 but also CIA, KGB and even more, a member of the Knights of Malta.This initially called the Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, was created in 1104 by Blessed Gerard of Marrique to collect, serve and support the pilgrims traveling to the \"Holy Land\". In 1521, Charles V gave them the island of Malta where they settled and became known as the Knights of Malta. It is one of the most secret orders linked to the Vatican.Being a member of the Order of Malta, Licio Gelli had fraternal links with William Casey, CIA chief and also Knight of Malta, and with General Alexander Haig, under the presidential administration of Ronald Reagan. This explains why one of the co-Gelli in bank fraud, Michele Sidona was special guest of the Nixon White House and because the very Gelli under the Reagan presidency.This whole web of connections behind the scenes, ie, Knights of Malta, Licio Gelli, William Casey, General Haig, Roberto Calvi, the Vatican, KGB etc, are widely discussed (in more detail) in the book by Gordon Thomas: \"The Year of Armageddon. \"According to Thomas, Pope John Paul II has (1), in Rome, weekly meetings with CIA agents and uses the Knights of Malta as messengers of secret communications with the CIA headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia.From the above, we see clearly that we have been, we all largely governed politically, socially and religiously by groups of financiers, secret orders and charlatans. I say we because evidantemente Brazil is not out of the loop. Quite the contrary.Delving into the subject requires time off and an awareness of the various constraints to which we atralados for centuries.There was a time that the Order of Malta was known as \"Knights of Rhodes\". Entretando his real name is \"Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM)According to researchers and writers, particularly mation, SMOM is the secret police of the Vatican and its members are sworn to do everything in order to destroy Protestantism, Liberalism, Democracy, Freemasonry and everything else that will endanger the \"Papal omnipotence\" in the last 400 years.In their research on the P2, Robert Anton Wilson was stunned by paradoxical fact that Roberto Calvi - the banker found hanged in London - was one member of the Knights of Malta.Now every training belonging to 33 degree, solemnly swear to oppose \"the Knights of Malta\" and all other agents of tyranny and superstition.I hope that readers will have noticed by now this intriguing mystery: how could this \"God's Banker\" be a Knight of Malta and Macau vowed to fight the Knights of Malta at the same time. How well could live side by side, CIA, KGB and the Vatican? This is a prosmicuidade to which I draw attention.Besides Roberto Calvi, we can point to members of SMOM in recent times, the following persons:- Franz von Papen - the home that convinced President von Hindenburg to resign and point Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany.- General Reinhard Gehle - secret service chief of Hitler who later became director of the Section of Penetration of the USSR.- General Alexander Haig - possessed of great influence in the Nixon and Reagan administrations. General Haig was the one who reported having \"evil forces\" creating evidence against Nixon.- Alexandre Merenches - former head of the French intelligence service.- William F. Buckley - spokesman of the faction \"pumps Jesus\" of Roman Catholicism.- Clare Booth Luce - wife of the founder of Time / Life for a long time enemy of the New Deal, later U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.- Umberto Ortolani - rich Italian fascist P2 member and founder of secret groups right in Latin"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"America. Associated with Roberto Calvi - and Bishop Paul (Gorilla) Marcinkus, the Vatican bank manager and Michele (Shark) Sindona, president of the notorious Franklin National Bank.But what matters to us all this?It turns out that there is a small trait that parace call one of the Thelemic this mixed orders of people from various fields of politics, religion and world society some of them bitter enemies.Before, however, elaborate on this delicate subject for Thelemites, I think I should develop the theme Priory of Sion for readers to have an idea, though Raida what it is.The mystery of the Priory of Sion has been thoroughly discussed in two books: \"The Holy Grail and the Holy Bloodline\" and \"The Messianic Legacy\", both Michaek Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincln. Those who wish to further deepening the matter I would indicate the reading of both.Apparently, the Priory of Sinai (another name under which this secret order is also known) has been a few years ago, discussed by Gerard de Sede. His work dates from 1962 and was written in a brief and enigmatic. But the first indication of the existence of this Order is in the \"Dossiers Secrets\".At the top of the page Dossiers Secrets where we find this statement, there is a note of René Grousset, considered the deepest historian of the Crusades. The annotation Grousset follows a mysterious allusion to the Monastery of Sinai - or Order of the Sinai, as the Priory of Sion was called at the time.In summary: the Templars were under the direct command of the Priory of Sion, the order was directed by ten Grand Masters whose names are among the most distinguished characters of the \"History.\" Although the Templars were persecuted and destroyed, the Priory of Sion remained untouched poe centuries, the Order exists and functions today.\"Not only influences how plays an important role in international affairs.\" The avowed purpose of the Order requires a more refined, but also a very open mind to matters somewhat considered extremely fanciful. But we can say that the goal is the restoration of the Merovingian bloodline and dinstia the throne not only of France, like other European nations. Although the despot sec. VIII this lineage has not died being perpetuated in a direct line from Dagobert II and his son Sigisbert IV.Of course one may wonder why this goal? Because according to the traditions, the Merovingian dynasty descended from Jesus and Mary Magdalene. And this was the big secret kept by the Templars and therefore persecuted and annihilated (not all) by the Roman Church.In \"The Vagina of Nuit\" Robert Anton Wilson, makes references to the Church of Mary Magdalene at Renne-Le-Chateau, built by the priest Sauniere (it is evidently connected to Priory of Sion). This priest, it seems Hermetica was also a member of the Brotherhood of Light in Paris. This was a secret order of which they were active members Claude Debussy (Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, in the period 1885-1918), Gerard Encause (Papus), and Aleister Crowley.Gerad Encause under the bike Papus wrote the most famous book about the Tarot and was closely associated with Rasputin in Russia before the Communist revolution. Crowley was the Outer Head of the Ordo Templi Orientis (another secret fraternity, allegedly originating from a Sufi Order and Knights Templar).According to Francis King in \"Satanists and Swastika\" the Outer Head of the Order before Crowley, Theodor Reuss, was also a member of the Intelligence Service Germanic and under the mission to spy the daughter of Karl Marx.It would be very interesting to give readers a longer ride on these issues and try to put all this data together with the Merovingian genealogy. The conclusions, I think, would be deeply shocking. For Roman Catholics a real disaster, because it destroys their beliefs and dogmas.But this is my summary would not be complete if I did not also speak about the \"Knights of Columbus\". Although these \"riders\" use the good name of the great Genoese navigator, we can not delude ourselves about their mission.The order of the Knights of Columbus (Columbus Knight) seeks to bring together all the elements and all clerical forces to combat Protestantism and Freemasonry. Under the lure of a liberal constitution, agremiam up these elements and preach the supremacy of the Church over the State.It is clear that the Jesuits and their allies impressed with the progress and development of the Great Liberal Establishment (Freemasonry) in the United States and other countries, amazed at the number of its members, seek the means fanaticize them Catholics and organized the Knights of Columbus , a secret"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"society to fight the Pope and the Church of Rome, to counter the propaganda, equality and fraternity made by tion.To have an idea of what the Order of the Knights of Columbus, this dark pool, simply transcribe the \"oath\" that must suffer the initiate, as published in the Bulletin of the National Patriotic Alliance:\"I. ....... in the presence of Almighty God, of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Blessed is the St. John the Baptist, Saints Aóstolos of St. Peter and Paul, all the Saints, sacred hosts of heaven and thee , My Spiritual Father, Superior General of the Society of Jesus, founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola in the Pontificate of Paul III and continuing until today, the womb of the Virgin Mary, Mother of God and Jesus Christ, declare and swear that His Holiness Pope is the Vicar of Christ and the one true head of the Catholic or Universal Church throughout the earth ............................... ...More promise and declare that I will have no opinion and will own, or any mental reservation, but, like corpse, unconditionally obey every order you receive from my superiors in the militia of the Pope and of Jesus Christ.That will go to any part of the world where you send me, the cold regions of the North, to thick piles of India, to the centers of civilization in Europe or to the huts of the wild wild barbarians of America, without murmuring or complaining, I will be submissive to all I ordered it.
