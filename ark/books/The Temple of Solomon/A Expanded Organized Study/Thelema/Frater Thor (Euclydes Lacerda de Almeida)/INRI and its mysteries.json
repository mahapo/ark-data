[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"INRI AND ITS MYSTERIESOne of the best known words and invoked by many mystics and magicians for INRI is the Tetragrammaton. I want, however, to note here that the term refers to the magician who practices magic. So in this concept the term Mage refers to the Initiation one degree Ordem.Esta Large difference between magician and Mage is of great importance for Thelemites.Made this observation continue.But what, after all, the meaning of this word?There are several meanings that unfold at various levels. Throughout this work, we reduced gradually (nature does not make leaps), penetrating its mysteries to the limit of our understanding.In an outer level, we could say that INRI are the initial couplet supposedly placed the cross on which, so Christians believe, died \"Jesus\": INRI would therefore \"(J) esus (N) azaret (R ) i of (J) udeus.But this assertion is unfounded, because long before the \"Jesus\" of the Gospels, these initial four were already known by the ancient sages shrines of Gnosis as a synthesis of the formulas of Nature.On another level we recognize that the initials INRI are enclosing the secret of the Holy Word of the Knights of the Rose Cross (Degree of Freemasonry Eighteen Orthodox), which are not mentioned, but is contained in a special constant dialogue of Ritual:Q. Whence come ye? R.: From J. P.: Which city you passed? R.: On N. Q. Who led you? R. R. P.: What tribe are you? R.: From tribe of J.Notice that the name of this degree is not Degree Masonic Rosicrucian, but \"Knights of the Rosy Cross.\" This determines the degree of this difference of those famous \"Rose Cross Orders\" as known by the general public.Historically, it is said, that the degree of Knight of the Rose Cross is based on the Gnostic doctrines of the Society of the Brothers of the Rosy Cross, whose foundation, or at least your organization, is attributed to John Valentin Andrea, Abbot of Adalberon, who died in 1564 . As in nature everything is born, it destroys everything, and everything regenerates, generation, destruction and regeneration are the main considerations that constitute the object of the Rose Croix degree, the theoretical development of the first three symbolic degrees of Freemasonry. This as pure Gnostic doctrine. As a policy, the degree Rosicrucian consecrates the memory of the emancipation of the people by the Brotherhood and discusses the means of reaching emancipation make this a practical reality.The primitive Magi (plural of Magus) formed with these four letters the following aphorisms:Ignem Natura Regenerating Integrat. Igne natura Renovatur Integrat Igne NITRUM Roris InveniturRosicrucians modern philosophers have them the initials of the words:India, Nature, Regeneration, IgnoranceIn other words:Nasu tireless Repellamus IgnoratiamOr, as the Jesuits say:Justum Necare Regis Wicked ('s just kill the wicked kings).Nor can we forget that INRI is similar to the tetragrammaton YHWH, and in this case, the initials INRI correspond, as in YHWH, the four elements of Fire, Water, Earth and Air, as well:(I) ammin - Water"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"(N) our - Fire (R) owahh - Air (I) abesch - EarthLikewise it can allocate one of these letters Tetragram IHVH the arms of a cross: IHVWe can also do it with INRI . II NR Notice that in both cases there is a repetition of letters.Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram in the word INRI is of paramount importance:INRI - Yod, Nun, Resh, YodJust need the most superficial knowledge of the assignments given in the Sepher Yetzirah, the pack of Tarot cards, slight notions of Gnosticism and astrology. The first action is to convert the four letters latunas their equivalents in Hebrew and later in their direct assignments as well:I (or J) = Yod = Virgo = y = N = Nun = Scorpio = n = R = Resh = Sun = r = I (or J) = Yod = Virgo = y =Searching Liber 777 (A. Crowley), in the column entitled \"Egyptian Gods\", we find the following:Virgo = ISIS = Mother Pujante = What is the Mother of all things. = Scorpio = Apophis The Destroyer (Death) Sun = Osiris = Dead and ErectedThe \"I\" end, being a repetition, is left to be taken only somewhere later to extend the meaning of those derived from the analysis. analysis late Keyword summarizes the formula with the initials of Isis, Apophis and Osiris, as IAO, the Supreme God of the Gnostics. IAO But it can also be interpreted as Igne Aqua Origo - The origin of the fire is in the water. What is a Key. Studying Liber Aleph see that the Epistles 71 and 72 are devoted to the Word INRI, but now on another level, perhaps never studied by most occultists, and even by Thelemites.Epistle 71KRISHNA, ET OF DIONYSUSKrishna has innumerable forms and names, and I do not know his real Birth human. For his Formula is of the highest antiquity. But His Word has spread in many lands, and we know today as INRI with the secret IAO concealed therein.And the meaning of this word is the way of the work of Nature in Her changes, ie, it is the formula by which all Things reproduce and recreate themselves. However, this extension and specialization was more the work of Dionysus, for the true Word of Krishna was AUM, implying a statement before the Truth of Nature than a practical Instruction in detailed Operations of Magic. But Dionysus, the word INRI, laid the foundations of all Science, Science as we say today in a private sense, that is, to make the change external Nature in Harmony with our Will."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Epistle 72Of TahutiTahuti, or Thoth, confirmed the Word of Dionysus by continuing it, for he showed how it is possible to drive through the Mind Operations of the Will. The criterion for recording and memory Man avoids error, repetition and error. But the true Word of Tahuti was AMOUN. Whereby He made Men to understand their secret nature, ie, Unity with their true Selves, or, as they then expressed it, with God.And He will unveiled the path of this achievement, and the relationship of this path with the formula INRI. Also, for your Mystery Number he made it easy for his successor to declare the nature of the entire universe in its form and structure, like an analysis of this, making the Matter what the Buddha was appointed to the Mind.Final Note:The serious student of the Mysteries may, of course, achieve greater depth about this word seriously studying and practicing daily the Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram, mainly by watching the actions required in the Ritual.He has in mind that LVX has a close relationship with ADNI, whose numerical value is 65.And the letters U, V, X, taken as symbols roman numerals is 65 (LXV)."}]
