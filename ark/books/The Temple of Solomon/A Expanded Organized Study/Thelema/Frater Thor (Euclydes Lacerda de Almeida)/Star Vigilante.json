[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"(Various Authors and Currents of Thought) A Toast FromSTAR VIGILANTEThe Journal of the New Aeon Society Directed and Edited by L. Euclydes Almeida Certain \"disseminators of Thelema\" not limited to say only what is necessary to the understanding of the doctrine, but slide into a vision of Thelema derived from their sick egos.The active involvement of the profane in complex disputes magickal due, largely, to the false Thelemites that to \"appear\", speak write and try to teach secrets never understand that due to the low level at which is their spiritual development. Are these \"Thelemites\" true apes on the evolutionary scale.It is easy to locate false Thelemites, most do not hesitate to temporize with lines of thought opposed to Thelema. Goetic Magic is a medieval practice. The name derives probably from another barbarous name. Some claim to derive from the word \"grammar\", but there is nothing precise about this.Goetic rituals are extremely complex, many of paraphernalia used in goetic are, in general, useless. The Classical Goetia addresses the Evocation of Demons 72 (Kings, Princes, Dukes, Marquises, etc..). I personally never had any attraction to this practice.Aeons can be thelemicamente speaking, be considered as periods of time, during which the universe is governed by a power (or particular \"God\"). That the Aeon of Isis, the Aeon of Osiris, the Aeon of Horus, etc.. Aeon can also be an Entity (Divine) as the Gnostic system. In Gnosticism, Aeon Eras are not, but beings itself, endowed with personality and life. As an example, Sophia and Idalbaoth.Enochian system, is a system of magic rather complex, consisting of the evocation of energies or entities Thirty Spheres \"existing\" around the Earth. System is a powerful and \"dangerous\" (ie depending on the point of view of each) was discovered or started by John Dee and Kelly Eduard. Perfected by the Golden Dawn. Crowley was his greatest popularizer abeam Liber 418.It is not very easy to develop the topics on which you question me, even though they are related among themselves.Initially, we know there is a huge number of schools and esoteric systems, each having their favorite theory. Unfortunately, the same is found within the Thelemic system which, at first glance, it seems to have weakened in recent years, but this is not true, because the system in more defined plans remain intact. Following the teachings of Therion see that he offered a line following within a rigorous procedure that can be summarized in the following words: \"Solvitur ambulando\".Therefore, I advise you not to hold my theories, ideas and conclusions. Look for the answers yourself. This is the great secret of our system, in that it imposes no conclusions, ideas, dogmas as do the evangelical sects, the very official Protestantism and of course, the Roman Church and the Doctrines Spiritualists. For that you feel the coercive violence of these such evangelicals read the article written by Mr. David Bay (Translation of Jeremiah dos Santos RDP) which can be found in http://espada.com.br. In this article the author insults our intelligence by saying things that have long been of our knowledge. Therefore refer ace own laws of God and Nature that he, one castrated physical and mental demand macular because your mind is rotting in this excrement of human thought called Protestantism. Does not mitigate his putrid ideas the fact that he also attack the Church of Rome, after all, is the mother of all these ideas, \"demonic\", making the life of man on earth a true slavery."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"On the other hand you should not follow those who, while esoteric, seeking in every way to diminish the influence of Crowley in the field of the occult. Again: the most I can do about your questions is to indicate to you certain principles. But it is you who should develop them until, through a great personal experience and certain trances, the light shines inside.To paraphrase Freud, \"the truths contained in the esoteric doctrines are after all so distorted and systematically disguised that the mass of mankind can not identify them as truths.\" And these disguises and these deformations are more pronounced as when these truths are interpreted and described by esoteric systems still connected to Aeon of Osiris, or one riddled with malice towards the benefit of the leaders of these systems. We have examples of these distortions Movement led by such a A.Weor Samael, the system of the Violet Flame, \"I Am,\" which are nothing more than a heap of rubbish created by minds sold, supported and financed by groups \"Roman Catholics\" interested in deviation from the truth. We can also include here such a \"spiritual university\", which now is showing up in our midst, coming not know where. So I can not take seriously a job sent to me under the \"Twelve Labors of Hercules\" which is a total deviation from the Greek legend of the Great Hero.We can get an idea of movement through the Thelemic OTO because A. '. A.'. is an Order which works purely spiritual lines, and somehow remain secret well but the OTO.The NamesWe affirm that the names of gods, angels and demons are real formulas for invocation of themselves. In addition, we also have a picture of these beings through their names, or rather through the set of letters in their names. The images thus formed are called Telesmatic Images. Indeed, whenever we invoke a being from the unseen world, we have a picture of this being that the invocation is best done. Therefore, the \"vibrate\" these names is common anthropomorphic figure visualize one of these energies, which we call gods, angels and demons.In this view display call magic, and it works in both directions. Works positively, by the skill of the magician in formulating images and keep them firmly in your mind for relatively long time, and also works negatively, the ability to make these images to life and proper motions, and observes them as it happens, or talk to them, keeping a balance between leaves them static or too strict, and be taken to the diffusion or chaos. Below is an example of the formation of these telesmatic images, so that the subject is well understood by the reader.Let us form the image of the \"angel\" Raphael; Hebrew RphEL. (Lhpr) The first letter refers to the head (face, etc.)R (r) - the letter of the sun - proud and dominant. Male, followed by a (a) - (Ar). A spiritual face, and must wear a helmet and winged helmet. Ph (p) - Corresponds to the body - strong, resolute, wearing shining armor. E (h) - (Ar) Golden wings and large size, partially covering the bottom of the figure. G (l) (Libra) - Feet and legs shapely. termination in EL (or AL), who appears in most names of \"Angels\", denotes that these \"Angels\" wield the Sword and the Balance of Justice.Let us now see the name Adonai (ADNI)A - Winged, white, bright, crowned D - Head and neck of a woman, beautiful but firm, hair long. N - Strong arms, outstretched like a cross. takes in his right hand branches of wheat, and the left one golden bowl. Great wings. I - Robe greenish yellow. A strong chest in which there appears a Lamen square with a Greek Cross Scarlet - In angles four smaller red crossesThe history of the evolution of the myth of Satan, would not be complete omitíssemos references to Enoch, or Hanock or Enoichion (Greek). It is through his book that the early Christian writers were aware of the \"history\" of the Fallen Angels."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Book of Enoch is classified as apocryphal. But what is apocryphal? etymology of the word shows us what she means secret, that is, that the book belongs to the class of those in the custody of the Hierophant and started, and never handled pro profane. Apocripha crypto comes from the Greek verb, \"to hide\". For centuries the Book of Enoch was preserved in the \"City of Letters\" and secret works - the old Kirjath-Sepher, later Debir (Joshuah XV, 15).Interested in the subject - especially mation - tried to identify Enoch with Thoth of Memphis, the Greek Hermes, and even with the Latin Mercury. Professionally - if we may use this term, now so limited in its meaning - as individuals, they are distinct from each other, they belonged to the same category of secret writers, of Initiators and Scribes of the Occult and Ancient Wisdom.These, as in Quran (see Surat XIX) are usually called Edris, or \"Illustrated\" (The Starter), Egypt gave birth to the name of Thoth, the inventor of the arts, sciences, or written letters, music and astronomy. Among the Jews the Edris became Enoch who, according to Bar-Hebraeus, \"was the first inventor of writing, books, arts and science, the first system that reduced the progress of the planets. In Greek it was called Orpheus.I wonder that Buddy refers to \"processes that Divine Mother Nature takes centuries to\" bury. \"Will you refers to Qliphod (shells)? If so, you this reasoning as if the tree Life had only two dimensions, as is typically shown in diagram. happens, however, that the two-dimensional scheme of the \"Tree of Life\" has been long ago, replaced by the one-dimensional, which is also not true, because the Universe has \"n\" dimensions. Did you need to know that, when he stepped on the path of initiation, you will be in touch with all that we are, and that Qliphod are also part of us, as are the tunnels of Set - the You can never go out in the sun without making a shadow. In an old article I wrote, I develop this argument in more detail: \"I show unto you a great mystery. Ye are standing between the abyss of height and the abyss of depth. \"\" In each awaits a Companion, and that partner is you yourself. You can not have another partner.Many têm'se erected, being wise. They have said: Seeks Bright Golden Picture in place always, and unite to that. Many have arisen, being crazy. They have said, \"Go down to the splendid world of Darkness and unite to that Blind Creature of Viscose Lama.\" I who am beyond Wisdom and Folly and ergo me tell you, both of these Realizai wedding!Unite both Companions.Caution! Caution! I say, seek not to lose one another. My fans are rightly raised; their head above the heavens, their feet below the hells.But since one is naturally attracted to the Angel, another to the Devil, the first link in the lower castle, the other binds more firmly to the higher. Thus the balance will be made perfect ... \"(\"Liber Tzaddi\"I'm not trying to prove anything against Thelema - actually do not have to prove anything to anyone about me or my ideas. I only wish to show that Thelema is deteriorating because of the way (or ways) of how it is being disclosed. Against this background, when the policy of lies becomes normal, paranoia and alienation are the \"order\" of the day.It is clear that the OTO (Caliphado, Tiphoniana, Draconian, etc.) as the main source of deception in recent years are more lost than anyone, because his reality-map has become a classic of disinformation system. OTO began to seek the villains to be blamed for this misinformation, and the rest of us (who have nothing to do with \"ORGANIZATIONS\" Thelemic) were hailed as the only villains in this shambles installed, so called, OTOs \"official\")\"Whatever you believe imprisons him.\"\"As stated by Brad Steiger, the insane asylums are full of people who naively proposed to study the Occult, even before actual competence to deal with the ordinary day to day\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"Most of the fans I met Crowley, seems to have decided to become a pompous ass of himself\" (T.Leary)One of the main characteristics of a genuine initiatory order is never charged by the initiation or maintenance of thirst, because the real initiatory order has no headquarters, stores or chapters that can be located anywhere in the world. Another feature is that it does not self -propaganda, whether on radio, TV or other media.The policy of an organization is to create real initiatory started and not be presented as a club whose membership base is constantly increasing, and this increase was considered something important.We did not find the initiatic orders. They do find us. A real initiation is a continual work in Internal Temple. Religiously speaking the Holy Guardian Angel is the Internal Christ. Psychologically it's the True Self Magically speaking is the discovery of his True Name. Mystically speaking you find it becoming nothing.Besides Crowley Therion is the Lord of the Aeon. Man Crowley was only a mediator in the process of emergence of the Thelemic system in the world. There have been other attempts, but these aborted because of numerous factors.If there is any true OTO working at the moment, anywhere in the world, I do not know.According to some authors the Secret of the OTO is construction of Elixir. According to some authors this Elixir serve to prolong the life of man (?). (Now I ask to prolong it?)The Order of Thelema is an order virtually unknown, whose membership is limited to those who have reached Grade Zelator in A. '. A.' .. There is a slight description of the Order in \"Calling The Children of the Sun\" (p. 110). Currently, as I understand, the Order is not in a state of activity.The New Aeon Society was set up Marcelo Ramos Motta, but took the form of organization under the tutelage of Euclydes L. de Almeida. The Society was designed to be the head of various Masonic and Thelemic orders, to be created in Brazil.The main cause of corruption in the OTO, it is, above all, is an order founded by Osirian.The plan Marcelo Motta was exactly change this feature.Dear Madam:This written early in his message: \"But I agree with you.\" Wrong.

(Nichollas Falleta)Legend has it that one day in the Los Alamos Laboratory, a group of young scientists excitedly discussing the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Concluded that aliens should exist, after all, the universe is infinite and we should not be the only intelligent beings in all that space. Then that would be physicist Enrico Fermi, who was listening to the conversation, would have risen in response and professed the famous phrase \"So where are they?\". As Fermi was brilliant and very famous, being the inventor among other things the first nuclear reactor, this simple phrase was born the \"Fermi Paradox\", one of the main"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"arguments used to say that we are alone. According to him, if the aliens exist, they should have already landed in front of the White House.There are serious problems with this legend. The main thing is that it indicates something that is simply not true: contrary to what many think, Enrico Fermi actually believed in the existence of extraterrestrial life. Another problem not only with this legend, but with popular knowledge, is that the Fermi paradox serves to prove that intelligent aliens do exist. If this were the case, the paradox does not exist: it is just a paradox because any response we give it is paradoxical. Whether the existence or the absence of intelligent extraterrestrial life.(Kentaro Mori) Message\"Undisclosed information advise caution until the year 2002. Least. Born in the German language, in Section XVII, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated that all that exists, exists as a consequence of something, not levity. Well before that, there by Sec .

So for arts of Aristotle and Leibnitz, it was established that accidents at each of our lives are no accident thing no: happen for a reason and seeking precise objective.
