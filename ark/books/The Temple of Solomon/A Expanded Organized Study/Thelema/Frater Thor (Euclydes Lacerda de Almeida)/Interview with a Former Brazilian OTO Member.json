[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Interview with a former member of the OTO In an interview granted to us, a former member of the OTO declared himself quite relieved to no longer belong to any branch of the Order, or any other organizations or alliances linked to this esoteric, cultivating, promoting and disseminating thelema, as one true system of spiritual training. In this position he calls Thelemismo. Also makes a warning not to get confused in the text, with thelemismo Thelema and Thelemic Thelemite with Thelemic uses the term to define those who think or have Thelemites as unique in the world.The Occult Knowledge is a double-edged sword, and who seeks to uncover its secrets and discover its mysteries must be aware of the serious responsibility and the danger inherent in this task.Q: What made you move away from Thelema and orders related to this system?A: I have not departed from Thelema, but the thelemismo and Thelemic. Just you watch carefully what happens with the orders, fraternities and / or groups for Thelemic, by itself, an answer. If this is not enough, I can say that the appearance of numerous documents, once kept confidential, together with facts that happened recently, played testify unethical, used by groups \"Thelemic\" to keep with it people are under the illusion they the true inheritors of a tradition coming from Rebalais, through Crowley to this day, and show more than enough reasons for my decision in this regard. Thelemic live in a mental and emotional chaos where various factions degladiam incessantly, without even knowing why. And none of these groups did anything so far to put an end to this.Evidently, the chaos favors to keep up appearances before his followers and ignorant public.Q. considered even if such groups do nothing to change this situation?A: If they do, we have seen nothing stating this action in the last twenty years of our experience in this country means esoteric.Q. What were your goals when joining Thelema?A: Just as every normal human being has a dream, a yearning, I too have a dream, and I always try to share it with those who are close to me. And I have shared with many of those who, pretending to be my friends and brothers, betray this trust at the first opportunity.Q. What is this dream?R.: The dream of a Brazil free, master of his destiny without outside interference, however well intentioned they may, or appear to be, a country without the huge social inequalities in which our people are immersed, without children and youth mired in violence, addiction degrading, etc..; without unemployed, elderly without humiliation, without a police brutalized; without corrupt politicians, etc.. Dream of seeing my brothers with easy access to everything they are entitled, without the need to exercise their rights to sell their souls to the persons or groups without any legitimate authority or spiritual quality protesting own self proclaiming themselves \"masters\", \"guides , \"and other such things. If we continue on this path chaotic world that awaits us is exactly that described by George Well in his novel \"1984\" or perhaps worse.Q. Would not this your dream utopia?A: That may be so. It depends. A few years ago, the dream of going to the Moon was also considered a utopia. Jules Verne wrote \"Journey to the Moon\" and was therefore considered insane, visionary, etc.., However, in our century man set foot on the surface of our satellite. It was a utopian dream, a vision or a prediction of Jules Verne? Every dream tends to take place when many dream and work together in search of any achievement.This is a law of magic that everyone should already know. However, what dominates and prevails among Thelemic is discord, unfair competition, mutual accusations, etc.. I think, unfortunately, Thelemic have embraced a doctrine totally wrong that has nothing to do with Thelema.Q: We would have conditions to finish with this state of affairs?A: Not wanting to be negative, I think it is now very difficult, at least in the medium term.The Thelemic with its policy, facilitated the opening of our Circle the terrible enemies of Thelema which thereby gained positions and forces in the past few years.Q. What are these enemies?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"A.: They are easily identified, because they follow the dictates of a doctrine whose aim is to destroy us as individuals self conscious. They abjuram Liber OZ, etc.. I call them \"men of black face.\"Q: Could you be more specific?A: Let's see: there are groups already mastered long ago by this force, with the sole purpose of ruining the actual bases of human evolution towards Real Spirituality. These groups live in the illusion that they are really representatives of an evolutionary power.And this they closely resemble the followers of the churches called Christian. These groups are strengthened through political and financial power, imposed by a caste without the slightest morality. Some of these groups hold, or linked, to the rich international forces, but whose wealth was, and is based on the exploitation of people and the poorest countries and the economic massacre of the weak, without their having any possibility of reaction, not be a heroic but suicidal, armed struggle, which further complicates the problem, as it is logical. You can not win a fight against rocks using heavy artillery. See the \"via crucis\" of Palestinians today.P.: The Thelemic teachings are not directed to evolution?R.: The Thelemites are the \"Thelemic\" no. You Thelema as others confused with \"thelemismo\". Confuses \"magic\" with spiritual growth. One thing has nothing to do with the other. Magical powers alone, never testify spiritual growth. If the magical powers translate spiritual growth not exist those whom we call black magicians, ie individuals (if they are individuals) of large \"supernatural\" powers, or mental, or whatever, but no moral or spiritual ethics .Q. I do not understand.A: It's simple: anyone possessed of patience, intelligence and a certain amount of personal determination can develop in yourself, magical powers. But spirituality is not.You can get the most amazing magical powers, but this does not mean that you have ever developed Wisdom, Understanding, Love, Beauty, etc.. We are tired of seeing people endowed with high intelligence, personal charisma, etc.. Using these gifts to crime, to war, to destroy and to profiteer.There are several examples of this kind of men and mulheres.Você should not believe that a well-developed astral body is a sign of high spirituality, this would be equivalent to assume that a lifter huge muscles is necessarily a person of elevated sentiments and noble intentions. So nothing magical aptitude confused with spiritual progress. The degrees of the A. '. A.'. , for example, mark stages in the evolution of the race perspective: magical or mystical powers only details that represent progress.Q. What is the biggest misconception of Thelemic?R.: judging the owners of the great solution. The presumption of them is huge, and is rooted in the illusion of the ego, in refusing to admit what is visible to everyone, that is, their doctrine (as Frater Achad had already seen clearly) is an unsound doctrine, created by a frenzied mind, etc.. Many people do not understand Achad, and take like crazy.Many of them, in their eagerness to temporal power, struggle to standardize practices and theories under the control of a central power which in reality does not exist and never existed. This will never work. See, for example, the Roman Church has grown in temporal power, but declined in the spiritual. They forget to take into account the particular needs and differences of each individual. Brazil, for example, has its own. For arrived here, over the years, representing many people and with them new cultures.The sicretismo between these cultures has become inevitable and understandable, and gave birth to its own culture very different from North American, or English, or Japanese, etc.. The OTO , for example, has German origins. We Brazilians ever we could \"adapt\" to the traditions or standards, or the German way of life. This is evident. Just do not want to see anyone. Therefore, the OTO , in Brazil, have to follow their own paths, otherwise chaos will never leave where you are. But for us it is a blessing because it prevents imported doctrines and created before and after Crowley evolve in our country.Q. If you were Thelemic, how then would act to overcome these difficulties?A: I can not accept the hypothesis of Thelemic, who am Thelemite. The major concern of a Brazilian Thelemite should be with our political and economic independence. Cut the bonds with the archaic traditions coming from beyond March Our concern should address the Doctrine of Essence. But watch out for the fact that Standardize is a fatal error. The single unifying code is in the basic works of Thelema. But I think the Thelemic never do this because they are lost in speculation originated brain rotting.Q. What about the practical life?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"R.: Liber OZ is the basis of everything. And Liber AL contains all the \"rituals\" necessários.Tem people out there wasting precious time with convoluted rituals ...welcome do not know where.Q. Which would be the best way for a person who wants to be Thelemite?A: In my opinion she should study, research and practice Liber AL and Liber OZ able to easily differentiate their wishes of his True Will, and later realize the difference between thelemismo and Thelema, and as the first is harmful to human . In a search next time the true origins of the OTO and what the true goals of the Order before and after Crowley.But to answer your question, assuming that the thelemismo was really a way to go (which really is not), I would say there is no default path. Standardize is uniform - Nature created us different from one another. 're Stars, each with its own individual orbit.Thelema abhors standards. Here is one more reason why the OTO Brazilian should not follow any rules or standards established in the original order, clearly not Thelemite.For better understanding, the path to the experience and interpretation of the system are the basic books of Thelema (which books are these? Aside from Liber AL and Liber OZ, others are at the discretion of each). Everything else is subject to the analysis and understanding of the principles of this doctrine.Q. The way you speak, it seems to me still a Thelemite, agree?A: I have already said that I am Thelemite but not Thelemic. I never denied this, just do not consider Crowley or Achad, or Germer, or Marcelo Motta, or any other, free of any errors or infallible in their opinions or conclusions.Q. Do you think there should be a Central Power disciplining all groups Thelemites?A: Initially I must say there are no groups Thelemites. Thelemites constitute one block, cohesive, strong, etc.., Although they are free in thought and action. Thelemites admit that \"The word of the Law is Thelema and\" Love is the law, love under will. \" Many people do not understand that.On one hand it is important to avoid the emergence of sects \"Thelemites\", as happened with Christianity (and even Thelemic), already in the first century had more than a hundred branches, the other one can not forget the countless gradations mental men.Thelema never be understood the same way by all people. This is also true for esotericism in general. Ai is the biggest obstacle, so-called esoteric science. As you evolve spiritually \"meaning\" change, \"mind\" \"opens up\" to deeper levels, higher, your vision goes further, etc.. Secrets are secrets for the sole reason that they can not be understood by profane, ie those who have not had the initiatory experience and its many levels ..Unless you have reached that optimum level of understanding you do not \"understand\" that the Will is both universal and unique. That we should all move according to our own Wills, which are each unique, however coherent the Universal Will.Q. What happens to be an order or secret society?A: It's all order or society whose existence is unknown to the public. Every order or fraternity or secret organization is even, imagined exist, otherwise it would not be secret.In general, it influences the world through orders (or fraternities, or even civil associations, etc.). Secondary that maintain contact with the outside world. Often these secondary orders even suspect being inspired by that secret order. Orders that are in contact with the public are called external orders. This is the general rule, and there may be exceptions.This influence can be benign or malignant, depending, of course, the dominant character of the secret order, or from the point of view of each particular person. Everything is relative. Evil to one may be good for another, as heat is good for breakfast but bad for ice cream. Currently, Freemasonry, the \"Rosicrucian Order\", and many others, are living examples of the semi-secret organizations. Its origins, operations and exploits are known in the outside world. In these orders, only rituals (generally) are hidden. I am not here reportarei political or economic decisions discussed in their secret meetings.Q. What are Masonic orders?Answer: There are several definitions offered to the public. In a general sense are those orders whose rituals are celebrated together. Are generally considered benign, working for the welfare of mankind, either in a spiritual or social. In recent years Freemasonry, having been dedicated harder to plan social, it seems somewhat away from the spiritual plane. Several of these orders do not follow any religious philosophy or"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"spiritual\" (in the true sense of the word). There are also those of malignant nature and / or criminal as, for example, the mafia, the Nazi SS, the KKK, etc..P.: The Order of the Knights Templar would be an example of a secret order?A: Not at all. If so, neither it nor its members would be even mentioned here. The proof is in the fact that she had been persecuted, its members imprisoned, tortured and murdered on the orders of King Philip of France, with the help of Pope Clement V in 1307.Q. Why did the Templars were persecuted?A: They were accused (rightly or wrongly, depends on your opinion, or the depth of their knowledge) of unspeakable crimes and heresies. This is the official version of the Church of Rome. However, in reality weighed heavily against the Templars financial-political problem. Felipe, the beautiful, King of France, vultuosa amount owed to the Templars. On several occasions, requested admission into the Order, however this was denied entry (the Templars were well aware of the lack of character of the King). We know, historically, that he craved the colossal wealth of the Order.Indignant at the refusal of his entry, driven by ambition and the spirit of revenge, turned against the Templars. Through blackmail, convinces the weak Pope Clement V, that the Knights Templar were strengthened to overthrow the throne of St. Peter. It is well known that the Pope had occupied the throne of St. Peter after a fraudulent election, manipulated by King Felipe. Committed to this \"help\", the Pope found himself pressed by blackmailing the King and could not refuse the requests real, even knowing the unjust, mendacious, etc..Q: As previously mentioned, there is always a hidden order behind the known orders. The same is true of the Knights Templar?A: Right. Today we know that behind the Order of the Temple found himself another, whose name is presumed to be \"Priory of Sion\" (this name may be a mask, do not know for sure), and that the aim of the Templars consisted to safeguard a big secret concerning the so called Holy Grail. According to Michael Baigent and his colleagues (see \"The Holy Grail and the Holy Bloodline\" - Ed New Frontier), \"..... the Templars were administrative branch and the military who served an order sacreta behind them. This order, which worked under a variety of different names, is better known as \"Monastery of Sinai\" (Prieure de Sion). \"It is also said that the Templars were sent to the Holy Land with the express purpose of finding something top secret. This is deduced by the numerous excavations they started under the foundations of the Temple of Solomon, this time already in ruins. What sought, has not hitherto been determined, nor know when they met. \"However, in 1128, six of the nine (ten if you count the Count de Campagne) original Knights who inhabited the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem for nine years, returned to France \"to get the approval and the statutes of the order, at the Council of Troyes, these were: Hugo de Payens, Mondidier, Archambaud Sainte Armand, Godoffroy Bisol, Rozal and Gondefroy. That is to mean that, in theory, only four remained in Jerusalem Templars awaiting the return of their comrades.It is well known that in these nine years, none of them went into combat and, according to witnesses, feared the arrival of this moment. According to Charpentier and other scholars of the subject, it is deduced that the knights sent to the Holy Land had already fulfilled the mission they entrusted to return to France in 1128.That the Knights Templar discovered on the premises of the Temple? It would be a treasure of incalculable value? Or an object of power? Or a secret weapon, as said by some researchers bolder? The latter encouraged politicians, soldiers and statesmen of the nineteenth century, and even the twentieth century, at the beginning of World War II, to go deeper in the study of the activities Templar, as was the case of the Nazis. many argue that the Knights Templar did not settled in Jerusalem to protect pilgrims, but to seek something extremely important, the existence of which they knew in advance.Q. What was then the main objective of the Templars?R.: Among several hypotheses highlight three of them.1. Finding the Holy Ark, and the Ark of the Covenant. 2. Finding the Holy Grail. 3. The Spear of Longinus.The Ark of the Covenant (not to be confused with Noah's Ark)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Refers to a container with a double lining gold closed by a cover made of solid gold (such as boxes containing radioactive material). Surmounted this cover two \"Cherubim\", also cast in gold, whose wings open and raised forward, lightly touching their tips (like the statues of Isis, the Egyptian gods or other winged). There were also two cases: one screen and another leather to protect those that carried (protect that?). In the Old Testament tells the story of the death of Aaron's sons, Nadib and Abihu, whose bodies were removed from the camp, as soon as possible, by express order of Moses.According to the writer Hancock (\"The Sign and the Seal\"), the deadly power of the Ark is evident from the exegesis of biblical texts, as they have to as a deadly weapon whose effects are devastating (these effects very similar to the effects of \"Weapon of Bima\" in the Mahabharata). See, also, as other examples, texts about the Walls of Jericho, the Philistines (I Sam, 5 and 6), the inhabitants of Beth Demes, which killed more than 5,000 men (Sam. I, 6-9 , Cron. 13) and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Charpentier's belief that the first Templars found the Holy Ark in the stables of the Temple, and that a group of Templars led her to France in secret, and it remained in place certain disappearing again the eyes of humanity. The movie \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" reports on Compass Adventure (Indiana Jones) about the power of the ark.However, the \"Kebra Nagast\", Ethiopian manuscript thirteenth century, mentions the Biblical story of the visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon in Jerusalem, but after the presentation to the court of Queen, the story takes an unexpected turn. The Queen of Sheba would have given the king a son, who while growing back to Jerusalem and stealing the Ark. This \"story\" is a key factor in the beliefs of the Ethiopians. From this, the Ark would have migrated for centuries, through the Arabian Peninsula and the Nile below to find its end in the Shrine Church of St. Mary of Zion This 'story' obviously invalidates the one connected to the Templars.The Holy GrailThe \"legend\" of the Grail is too well known, explored and commented in circles \"esoteric\" and exoteric, and especially the operas of Richard Wagner (Parzival, etc..) The Grail is the cup in which, so it is said, Joseph of Arimathea collected the \"blood\" of Jesus, who ran from his wound caused by the spear of Longinus.According to a new chain, the Holy Grail is a corruption of \"Sangre Real\", referring not to the blood in the bowl, but the family inheritance (genetics) of Jesus. (On the subject will be a summary at the end of this interview). If we delve into the topic, we could say, as some researchers claim the great secret of the Priory of Sion, is that their leaders are up the Merovingian kings, and these descendants of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Others claim they are descendants of aliens.The Spear of LonginusIn 1097, the army of the Crusaders takes after very difficult and bloody battles, the mighty city of Antioch, but is then surrounded by the troops of the Sultan of Mosul. During the siege, a priest named Peter Bartholomew, claims to have dreamed that St. Andrew had revealed where would the Spear of Longinus (Longinus, so says the legend, was a Roman centurion who attended the crufixão of Jesus), and used his spear to across the chest of the crucified Golgotha (note the connection of this boom with the Holy Grail).Based on the dream of Peter Bartholomew, are the spear in the ground of a church in the city surrounded. After this the Crusaders break the siege, release the city and march triumphant over the troops of Islam. Two years later conquer Jerusalem.This launches a powerful talisman, would give its possessor the power to never suffer any military defeat, passed into the hands of the Templars.Thus, the neo-Templarism of the XIX and XX centuries, gave considerable importance to this object \"magical\", whose title, according to some commentators, was the real goal, secretly designed, the invasion of Austria by Hitler's troops. The boom should find yourself in the Habsburg Imperial Treasury (currently Schatzkemmer the Hofburg Vienna) along with other treasures and objects of religious-esoteric meaning. Treasury Imperial Habsburg Vienna also contains jewelery and objects belonging to the Order of the Golden Fleece Gold, founded in 1423 by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, including the Cross of the Order and the Oath necklace, which hangs upon the Lamb, representing the Golden Fleece legend of Jason - all traditional symbols of deep magical significance .Q. Where does Nazism in all this?A: During the Nazi era, Hitler took possession of the Holy launches (1938-1945) and buried in Nuremberg, in a place only known to himself."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"In this context another fact quite significant happened to Hitler when, as a boy, a student of Lambach. This abbey was visited by a monk of the Cistercian Order (Adolf Lanz). This monk tried to put together a series of \"tests\" in order to strengthen the view that held about the history of the Aryan race. The Cistercian Order was restored by Bernard of Clairvaux (same St. Bernard of Templars). Consider also that Bernard would be the follower of an ancient Celtic and Druidic religion disguised within Christianity.This Adolf Lanz reappears later in Vienna, founded in 1900, the Order of the New Temple (modeled on the original Templar Order), proclaiming himself Grand Master and telling yourself \"started\" by a successor Master Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Templars original.It is historically known that Germany at this time was being driven by a fast and powerful industrial revolution and militarize need to be able to face competition English industrial.It is at this point that arise various nationalist publications and esoteric. One is the paper called Ostara (1905), founded by George Lanz von Liebenfels, who is none other than Adolf Lanz himself. The newspaper had adopted the swastika as its logo sinistrógena.Various witnesses and historians say that Hitler was a constant reader of the newspaper.The newspaper announces a religious revival, sexual and racist among the Aryans, bringing redemption and freeing them of \"demonic beasts men.\" Thus, advocates the extermination of inferior races.Another root of Nazi thought, this little known, has its origin in the Thule Society, created by Baron von Sebottendorf, and allied to the Templar Order of the Germans, founded, it seems, in 1912.The Baron Sebottendorf since his youth was irresistibly attracted by Islamic esotericism.On one of his trips to Turkey, meets started Druze and claims to have received teachings of the \"World Teacher\" (compare with Theosophy, Golden Dawn, etc..), The Lord of Thule and Shambala.As shocking as it may seem to us, these racist doctrines born with HP Blavatsky. The teachings of Theosophy on the races and sub-races and a type of human being spiritually developed in the Age of Aquarius, were taken literally and so misrepresented by German nationalists.P.: King Philip the Fair could totally destroy the Templar Order?A: Of course not. Large number of Knights Templar had taken refuge in other orders, keeping transmitting and thus the \"secret\" which, it is said, were keepers. But I think that over time, the real secret is lost in legend. The main order which gave shelter to the Templars, who escaped death, was the Order of Christ that had its greatest development in Portugal. The story goes as follows: \"D. Diniz was indignant strongly tract given to the Knights Templar, and Knight himself, Faithful Love and Troubadour, ignored the papal orders and the King of France to arrest the Templars in Portugal. \" Strategically, D. Diniz cancels the Order of the Poor Knights of Christ and of the Temple of Jerusalem supports the foundation of the Military Order of Our Lord Jesus Christ, known as the Order of Christ, composed of the ancient Templars.Q. From which it was the fate of the Templars? To which they engaged, after the destruction of the original order?A: In order to discuss the matter, we do a draft on certain facts which, a priori, appear to us without any connections between them. shall begin by assimilating the Pathfinder of the Seas \"never before navigated\" arose in the same specific time and that most of them were members of the Order of Christ, that is, a name under which concealed the Knights Templars who managed to escape the murderous fury of Philip the Fair, King of France. Under this name, the Templars dedicated to the maritime activities. Vasco da Gama was Grand Master of the Order. All ships of the Knights of Christ bore in their sails, the Cross of the Order Tenplária. The Cross was the one adopted by the Temple known as \"Patea,\" which had been officially recognized.Columbus crossed the Great Sea (Atlantic) to 'discover' a sea route to the Indies by the West, and eventually \"discover\" the Americas. Pedro Alvares Cabral, going to the Indies \"discovered\" Brazil \",\" Land of the Sacred Fire, \"and an old\" legend \"among the Nordic peoples.Columbus was married to the daughter of a former knight of Christ. It is said that her father presented her with the famous \"Piris Reis map\", which is informed by several researchers, which could only have been designed by someone who was located in Earth orbit, ie in space. (Further details of this map can be found in my book 'The Tower of Babel'). Would you like to add here a curiosity:The name Christopher Columbus is derived from Cristoforus, ie, \"one who carries Christ\" (as St."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Christopher, carrying the \"baby Jesus - Horus - the shoulders.\"). That the \"holy\" to be the patron of travelers, drivers (currently), etc.. All this pure symbolism. Colombo, obviously, Columbus, a dove, referring to the Holy Spirit. Likewise there is another curiosity in the name of Pedro Alvarez Cabral, who before leaving on your trip \"to India\" (and been discovering Brazil, which already had this name long before 1500) was called Pedro Alvarez Belt. Cabral comes from \"goat\" (the family crest of Cabral bore the figure of a goat). This reminds us of the \"goat\" Masonic and Chapel, a star of great importance to esoteric, located in the constellation Auriga - a name that, in turn, reminds us of the ATU VII, The Charger Grail (The Chariot).The majority of Templars survived the persecution, dedicated to the maritime industries, commerce and the arts. It is claimed that as many returned to the Holy Land and there became members of Islamic orders. We all know that the Temple maintained close relations with the Order of Assessins (singular, Assas, \"Guardians\", in the plural, \"Assassins \"formed in the mid-eleventh century, esoteric forefront of Ismaili Shiites, calling themselves, as well as the Templars,\" Guardians of the Holy Land \", always geographically uncertain but deep Paradise Original Homeland of Prester John or John Landless. A Doctrine of the Assassins stood in line Hermeticism, the Kabbalah and Alchemy. belonged Order To this the greatest poet of Islam: Omar Khayan.Q. How did the Templar orders in our day, since the original was dissolved?A: Only after four hundred years of the 'dissolution' of the order, is that Europeans were interested in the occult history Templar and began to exploit it for their own benefit. More or less in the eighteenth century, some tion, having climbed higher degrees of your order, came to the conclusion (right or wrong) that the activities of the Templars, and the fact that the symbolism of the First Three Degrees of Freemasonry (Blue), centered on the \"construction\" of the Temple of Solomon, indicated some historical link between the two Orders . So quickly emerged numerous fraternity clamoring to \"Templar\". Among these are the main ones are: the Strict Observance, the Royal Order (Scotland), and the Order of the Temple (France), the latter using a non orthodox Gospels of St. John. however, this conclusion would have been somewhat hasty. In my personal opinion, Freemasonry has nothing to do with the Templars, at least as regards the activities and fastened the famous Knights Monks. Unless we come to consider that, in Scotland, while some sought shelter Templar Masonic Shops in forming this link. However, this time, Freemasonry was still an association of Masons, devoid of esoteric character that today has become one of its features.In Brazil we know two organizations said Templar: The Civil and Military Order of the Knights Templar and Ordo Templis Orientis. On Civil and Military Order does not have a lot of data, unless they had their activities in our country until the 40s, when its doors were closed, reappearing on January 18, 1985. The founder of this cycle is the current Grand Master Prince D'Asklepio Sparta. When the OTO , we can not claim to be a really Templar Order in the mold of the Order of the Temple of Solomon. Both are distant, and even antagonize greatly on multiple items.\"Despite seeing nowadays these and those, to dozens, all claiming\" legal succession \", called\" Templar Orders \"that are nothing templistas, full of playful nostalgia and chimera, the truth can not go unnoticed and is very simple : was the Pope who extinguished the Order of the Temple, and can only be the Pope to approve it again. Now this is a fact that only the first part is true till date. Moreover, and there to forget, the Templars recognized as two hundred, canonically, by Papal Bull and approval of the entire Curia vaticânica.Q. What is the OTO? What are its characteristics?A: In order to answer these questions, we must, first, provide some data on the system Thelemite, or Law of Thelema, under which some branches of the order is placed.Thelema is an esoteric system, appeared in 1904, and based on a purported message (called Liber AL vel Legis, or Liber AL, also called The Book of the Law), dictated by an entity praeterhuman called Aiwass (or Aiwaz), the known occultist Aleister Crowley (also known as Frater P., Therion, etc..). The receipt of this message occurred in the city of Cairo, on days 8, 9 and 10 April 1904. The entity claimed to have been in a previous incarnation, Ank-nf-Khonsu \"Minister\" of Hoor-paar-kraat an Egyptian deity. The unusual event, according to Crowley, inaugurates called Aeon of Horus, or the Age of Aquarius-Leo. However, according to other esoteric, including Vitor Manuel Adrião, and the very traditional astrology, the Aquarian Age will begin in 2005."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The system is based on the text of this message.In the words of Crowley: \"... the contents of the book proves, in a strictly scientific and demonstrable as such, that Aiwass has knowledge and power beyond anything that has yet been associated with human faculties ...... The book announces a New Law to mankind ... It replaces the moral and religious sanctions of the past, that everywhere deteriorated by a principle valid for every man and woman in the world, and of course for yourself \"(Book Four Part IV.) The key of the whole system is the Word Thelema (WILL in Greek), whose sum is 93 Qabalistic.However, there are doubts about the veracity of the \"history\" of Crowley about the genesis of the Book of the Law Crowley said he found the Stele of Revealing (classified under n. 666) at the Museum of Boulaq in 1904. But this is impossible, since in 1902 the Cairo Museum was inaugurated and to this new museum, which is the current, were transported all the collections of the former Museum of Boulaq. How then could find Crowley Stele of Revealing in Boulaq Museum in 1904 if he no longer existed since 1902?In 1998 I was in Cairo, and certainly in his museum. To my great disappointment I found that the computerized catalog of the museum is not in the Funerary Stele of Ankh-nf-KhonsuQ. How did the Law of Thelema in Brazil?A: In 1962 - a memorable date for many, and for others the onset of the disaster in their lives - the first time the system Thelemite proved to the Brazilian public. The revelation was made by a small book entitled \"Calling the Children of the Sun\". Ali was treated to Thelemic doctrine, and with unprecedented detail for the first time in Brazil. Moreover, it offered the opportunity to contact the system in our own country, via address posted at the end of the book.However, truth be told, appeared slight references (but totally misleading) about it Thelema in a very old and no longer existing, monthly publication called \"Kabbalah.\" The little magazine was distributed under the responsibility of an organization known as esoteric AGLA AVID (notice the initials of the names), led by a woman known under the name of Yaradasã (magical name, of course). This organization \"magic\" was ephemeral existence, and the publication has refereida. In certain exemplary, were given very vague news of such a Alcister Crowley (note the error in the spelling of the name), treated as a leader of a society sacreta practicing black magic using \"will power\" (ie: Thelema). Nothing more was said, and never through this journal, appeared publicly any reference to such a black magician, or on such secret order.Q. I've heard rumors that the FRA is inserted into the system of Thelema and therefore was the first in Brazil to promote the Law of Thelema. This is true?R.: Stating that the FRA disclosed publicly, and in the era before 1962, the Law of Thelema is to show complete ignorance (and often bad faith) the facts and ignoring the environment in which Brazilian society lived in those times in the tangent esotericism. The FRA, founded by Krumm-Heller (Frater Huiracocha), I assumed, it is true, the Law of Thelema, but this was done in a rather veiled, distorted and restricted environment of members started in higher grades. While it is true that the initiation rituals of the three degrees of that fraternity 'Rosicrucian', looked back at Thelema in a very subtle and, in its entirety, remained within the Masonic Osirian standards. The Gnosis magazine, published several years ago by the FRA, was distributed (or sold, not sure) only recognized members started the organization. At least that's what I told a former member of the FRA, Mr. P. (Mr. P. sadly passed away recently). If some copies of this publication were found in any bookstore or sebum of our city, it is because those who possessed them (it was the original owner, this heir or some relative) wanted to get rid of them. I even own a few copies published between 1949 and 1973. I bought them a secondhand bookshop in the existing Republic of Lebanon Street, a few years ago. By coincidence one of them found a poem by Marcelo Ramos Motta, stating that, in fact, my late instructor outside an initiate of that fraternity.The leaders of both FRA feared it became evident connection with the FRA Thelema, or more specifically with Therion (Aleister Crowley) that a picture of Crowley, exposed to the public eye in the premises of the Order (by 1948), was removed. One of the former members of the FRA said that one day, soon after its initiation, having commented about the picture with an older member, he had said, in surprise at the question, it was the portrait of THERION, one of the masters most important fraternity. Seemed astonished to see this new member as ignorant and suddenly did not want to talk about it.What matters to cover up the connection with the FRA Crowley, saying that this link has never existed, we transcribe here the words of Krumm-Heller in \"Logos Matram and Magic\" - Ed Kier SA - 1990: \"Al illuminated invisible maestro del Cuyo nombre no se debe stamping, a los maestros Basilides, Perdurabo Recnartus y ... \". now, Perdurabo is none other than Crowley himself, who used this magical bike in its passage by the Golden Dawn."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Dying, Krumm-Heller FRA bequeathed to his son Parzival Krumm-Heller. However, the Brazilian branch of the FRA refused to accept Parzival as a world leader of the Order.Herein followed the line of thought of S.Clymer and Samael Aun Weor.With respect to Parzival Krumm-Heller are two interesting details. First, he would have been the introducer Marcelo Ramos Motta in Thelema. Subsequently submitted Motta their future in AA instructor, Mr. Karl Germer (Frater Saturnus X ° OTO ). Second, by the will of his father (Krumm-Heller) he was enrolled in the famous NaPolA.Q. What becomes NaPolA?R.: The call Napola consisted of a set of German schools for students between 10 and 18 years. In 1941 there were 32 such schools, where 6000 students were trained as National Socialists (Nazis), efficient body and \"mind\", to serve the people and the state. Ali formed the elite of the Nazi youth. Therefore, one has to ponder the guidelines of this \"started\" German ...Q: What is the fate of Parzival Krumm-Heller?A: After many years without giving news, reappeared recently, being now, it seems, connected to Caliphado.Q. Who was Samael Aun Weor?A: He was a disciple of Arnold Krumm-Heller (Huiracocha) who fought frantically Thelema. His name himself Maitreya Buddha, Kalki Avatar of the New Age of Aquarius, and founded the Universal Christian Gnostic Movement that, in Brazil, won many followers. His book \"The Perfect Matrimony\" was widely reported in our country. In another of his many books, \"Rose Ignea\", published by the Brazilian branch of the Movement, Samael Aun Weor states the following about Parzival Krumm-Heller (P.25 ), \"... this negative sexual magic, which teaches the traitor Parsifal Krumm-Heller, and Baal sinister Omar Cherenzi Lind \"Q. Going back to the previous question: how did the OTO , and what their purpose?R.: The OTO was created, according to some scholars, the early twentieth century. Its creator would have been a high degree of training name Karl Kellner. This training and industrial Germanic (so it is said), in one of his many travels through Europe, America and Asia, contacted numerous initiatic organizations. The enthusiasm that has been taken in these contacts birthed Karl Kellner in the desire to create a Masonic Academy for Advanced Studies, which would facilitate the interested brothers become familiar with all existing Masonic degrees and systems in the world. Some versions tell as true that he had contact in one of his trips, with three fans - one Arab and two Hindus - but there is nothing concrete about it.This 'story' of encounters with fans and Secret Chiefs is very repetitive esoteric annals of almost all existing systems. It is the same as that found in the biography of MacGregor Mathers, Blavatsky, and many others, including that of Aleister Crowley. Anyway, the \"story\", and the name of three fans contacted, appear in various commentators. The names of these supporters are: Arabic Soliman ben Aipha, and the two yogis Shen Pratad Bhima and Sri Paramahansa Mahatma.Q. There were even these three fans?A: If you really exist, or were purely Kellner creation of mind, it becomes a matter on which we do not have any hands on enough data to accurately assess, unless common sense.Q. When the OTO was really founded?A.: It is assumed that Kellner has founded the order in 1895. But if so, the order would then be a very selective and secretive organization, because we know nothing of it until 1904.P.: Karl Kellner worked alone in this endeavor?R. John Yarker, Head of various pseudo-Masonic rites, patented three German occultists with the aim of establishing a Grand Lodge in Germany working on ANCIENT AND PRIMITIVE RITE OF MENPHIS And MIZRAIN, AND THE ANCIENT AND ACCEPTED SCOTTISH RITE OF CERNEAU. These three were occultists Theodor Reuss, Franz Hartmann and Klein. A Grand Lodge was founded and immediately published a periodic newsletter called Oriflamme, addressing issues Masonic and occult. In 1904, this journal announces the OTO led by Kellner. One would assume he had the help of these occultists."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"P.: The OTO has always been linked to the Thelemic system?A: No! The story is about the following: With the death of Karl Kellner, the leadership of the order passed into the hands of Theodor Reuss. This Theodor Reuss possessed a quite unique character. Agent was paid by the German Secret Service. Sometimes presented as ardent follower of Marxist Socialism. Using this disguise, infiltrated the British Socialist Movement, and there happened to spy the daughter of Karl Max Finally, under suspicion was expelled from the Socialist League. Under the leadership of Theodor Reuss, the OTO experienced modest success, patenting brotherhoods hidden in France, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria and North America. The Patent Papus is that time.The entry of the order Crowley gave up so still not very clear, because the various existing versions. Probably he was a member of the VI ° since 1910 (Crowley belonged to numerous Secret Orders and Masonic. The OTO was one of them, which he deemed to be a more Masonic Order.), when Reuss met for the first time. But there is no documentation to support regarding this ticket before his meeting with Reuss. One way or another, Crowley, \"by invitation Reuss\", entered directly into the IX ° in 1912, becoming \"SUPREME AND HOLY KING OF IRELAND, AND ALL THE SOVEREIGN SANCTUARY OF BRITISH Gnosis.This branch of the Order, led by Crowley, was called Mysteria MYSTICA MAXIMA. Crowley had already, in 1904, received Liber AL vel Legis, initiating the Thelemic movement in the world, began to use the OTO as a vehicle for Disclosure System. Some authors claim that Reuss was opposed to this initiative Crowley, forbidding him to do it.Should not mix with Thelema OTO But as Crowley insisted on pursuing this path, it is said that the Reuss expelled the Order. I suppose a more lengthy and impartial should be done in order to reach a definitive conclusion of this topic. But either way, there are certain writings Reuss in which the separation between Crowley and it is implied.In 1921 Theodor Reuss gave a patent of OTO S. Lewis, and S. 1930 Lewis joins another German occultist named H. Tränker (1880-1956). H. Tränker appoint himself as successor in the leadership of Theodor Reuss OTO . Using the magical bike Recnartus, Tränker founded Societas Pansophia. Then, he and Lewis create the International Headquarters of the Supreme Council of AMORC, in Berlin. From there, Lewis starts the noise its links with the Rosicrucians fermânicos.Q. How can joining Crowley Order directly at the IX °? Is it not contrary to norms of OTO ?A: No. First, there is a tradition in the Order that allows this. Any man or woman who \"discover, for yourself, the Secret Order of the Central or takes possession, or receives, for any reason, Liber C vel AGAPE automatically receive the degree. This happened to several members of the Order, among which we mention: Frater Hymenaeus Alpha Frater Parzival, Frater Aster, Quif Frater Frater Iskurus and others. Secondly, in the case of Crowley, he had published the secret in \"THE BOOK OF LIES \"demonstrating know it deeply.Q. How was followed by the succession in the OTO ?A: It seems that in 1921, Theodor Reuss had abdicated his position as Leader of the Order (OHO) in favor of Crowley, or more correctly in favor of Frater Baphomet (Crowley's magical motorcycle), making it the world leader of the Order. This is also a subject much discussed. There are assertions that Reuss had abdicated his post by the imposition of an attack. And at this point begin discussions until today unresolved, even by leaders of the various branches of the OTO in the world.Q. By whom and why, Theodor Reuss was threatened?A: So far this point has not been clarified. In several books we are told that he apparently had executed one tactical retreat due to refusal to accept several Germans Shop the Book of the Law as a Canon of the Order, more explicitly the Third Chapter. But elsewhere is informed that this is not true, and Theodor Reuss in 1920 - a time when it is said to have been the attack - he was participating in a Masonic Congress in Zurich.Moreover, Crowley, in his Magical Diary 1921, reads as follows: \"I have proclaimed myself OHO\" And in a letter to Heinrich Tränker (1924), Crowley, Reuss admits that at any time there had been chosen as the successor to the Order .Q. How, then, after these facts, continued succession in Order?Answer: Whatever the story, the leadership of the OTO not changed hands easily. Much of shops and other Germanic countries, rose in strong opposition to Crowley. Some of them just wanted to walk their own paths. And this was one of them right. Other broke definitively with Thelema due as aforesaid, the Book of the Law The greatest opposition to changes Thelemites, Germans departed members whose Branch, it seems, had fallen under contrôle Heinrich Tränker."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Q: Nothing has been done to change this?A: Of course. The growing problem worsened when, in 1925, Crowley, Lea Hirsig, Dorothy Olsen and Normann Mudd, met with Tränker Helena Degree (wife Tränker), Eugene Grosh, Karl Germer, Martha Kuntzel. Hopfer, Birven and other occult leaders of the time.The purpose of this meeting - known as the \"Conference of Weida\" - was to discuss the acceptance or rejection of the Law of Thelema, and discuss the possibility to unite various factions hidden under the leadership of Therion (Aleister Crowley).Q. They came to an agreement?A: Unfortunately not. The result of this conference was that everyone would expect: Grosh, Kuntzel, Karl Germer, Lea Hisig and Normann Mudd placed next to Crowley. Grau, Hopfer, and others, were with Tränker. Accordingly, the OTO again suffered division.Indeed, the action of the Black Lodge was greatly strengthened.P.: How to Order continued after this division?R.: Crowley continued to lead the Branch Ingles. With his death in 1947, this branch handed to Karl Germer (Frater Saturnus) which, after the Second World War, he moved to the United States. Germer drastically reduced the number of initiations in the Order, to dedicate themselves solely to the publication of the works of Crowley. It seems to us, this was definitely his plan to dissolve the Order of the way it was presented and structured.But this is just my personal opinion, it should not be accepted a priori.Q. Why do you think so? On what is this opinion?R.: Crowley, as noted, died in 1947 (heart attack) without clearly naming his heir and successor. In the last years of his life, his right arm was Karl Germer. Crowley had started Germer directly to IX ° OTO it had no passage through the lower grades. I have explained how this can be.It is rather curious that although Crowley saw Germer as his successor, he did not bother to train him for the position of leader of the Order, and not even care if Germer wanted the job or not. Crowley, dying, left behind a confusing state of affairs with respect to the Order and its own leadership succession it. Although it was his desire to succeed Germer, this was felt not to be able to work, and declined to become the OHO - a position very different from those who came after him - so chose to remain as Grand Treasurer General of the Order, assuming the custodial role of an order that was effectively inactive, with the exception of shops that refused to follow Crowley and the Book of the Law In the years following the death of Crowley, the OTO was no command and in total disarray. Some stores still tried to stay active, but soon closed.Substantiating the denial of Germer to assume the position of World Leader, transcribe excerpts from letters written by him and addressed to Kenneth Grant, the season has not kicked off the OTO Kenneth Grant was expelled via a letter (registered) sent by Germer in July 20, 1955. But, particularly, I doubt Germer had the right to expel K.Grant. On September 24, 1948, Germer writes the K.Grant:\"... you must study everything that is published about the Constitution, etc.., the OTO You should know that I'm not the OHO not even know if I should take the job if it is imposed me ... \"(the italics are mine )It is quite clear from the above that the work you have not been imposed, and that he was reluctant to be recruited for the job. In another letter dated May 25, 1951, is written:\"... Firstly, do not address me as your superior. This is true in a strict and limited sense.What I seem to be the OTO was shoved me against my will. I'll do what I can, but I refuse to make statements that go against my nature. Strictly speaking I am the Grand Treasurer General of the OTO no less! The overall situation cries out for someone who has the will and strength and the ability to grow as supreme leader. If it appears have my full support. But personally I will not cry false pretenses. I told everyone that I never learned the rituals, nor saw them run, even the Mass: in short, I have no attraction for organizing the order. \"(The italics are mine)Germer constantly repeated unless the OHO, and that neither wants to be, and felt inadequate for the job. He was a Master of the Temple and AA, as such, is opposed to Masonic orders. Moreover, had the intuition that give these orders ... On January 18, 1952, wrote:\"... I've never systematically by degrees, etc.. So I can not instruct you in this particular work ... \"And later in the same letter, extends:"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"\"... you ask me: what is happening with the OTO ... There is no active Lodge in USA, theOTO \"As you can see, is more than evident that Germer never considered the OHO of the Order. And surprising as there are people repeatedly (and stubbornly) stating this: that Germer was the Outer Head of the Order. Germer literally despised these positions, titles, degrees and commendations purely formal. But currently, there are groups of Boeotians fighting each other for exactly the \"ownership\" of these positions, titles, etc.. It is to laugh, if I had time for this.Q: Why was there so much confusion in the OTO Thelemic after Germer's death?A: Following the death of Germer (1962), and precisely because of its dubious testament (for me this is further proof that Germer intended for motives and reasons beyond my perception, that the order, as it stood, was dissolved), the confusion in the Order was complete and therefore several leaders presented themselves as genuine His eyes are wanting to assume world leadership. I have stated in other posts, my private opinion about the will of Germer. However, I draw attention to the lack of accuracy of the same.How could Germer goods leave the order for the \"Heads of the Order\" (the head word in English (Head) is written in the Testament, plural-Heads), in reality there can be only one head? Do not Conform to the preposterous story that would have confused Germer OHO (Outer Head of the Order - Outer Head of the Order) with \"Kings\" (Kings of the Order - Order of the Kings). That would be considered a perfect Germer illiterate in the English language, and without any knowledge of the Statutes of OTO This is absurd. Kings may be several, each reigning in your country. OHO But there can only be ONE. Germer never have exchanged positions. Why, then, he wrote Heads (Heads). What was your intention in writing this? We do not know ... maybe.Q. I notice that this problem is quite intricate. But tell me, what were the who claimed the office?R.: In England, Kenneth Grant publicly assumes the title and, for this, issues a manifesto.Your first step is to dissolve the structure of the Masonic Order and reformulate their particular vision of the OTO Kenneth Grant was patented in 1951 or 1952 to work with the First Three Degrees of the Order. All was well between him and Germer until 1955, when Grant founded Shop (Shop New Isis) working with Eleven Degrees, and whose rituals were designed by himself.Then publish the manifesto quoted above, sending a copy Germer, but refusing to forward copies of Rituals, alleging that could be handled by the wrong hands. Because that his expulsion, etc.. But Grant never took seriously this expulsion and continued their work independently.Kenneth Grant, consider the OTO as having its origins in a certain \"Star Tradition.\" This tradition, he said, would have been maintained through the centuries, since ancient Egyptian (there are also some veiled references to Atlantis, Lemuria, and beings of Outer Space.) In 1955, Grant, through his Manifesto announces the \"discovery\" of a transplutaniano planet, which he called ISIS.The OTO reformulated by K.Grant is now known by OTO Typhonian, and confers initiation without the use of rituals. What, in my view, is a breakthrough. In fact, he turned theOTO in order following the guidelines of AA is necessary to say that the OTO Typhonian not charge a penny to start, or solicit any contribution. Their integrity at this point (initiation) is absolute.Q. Why do you say that Mr. Kenneth Grant, perhaps, could not be expelled by Germer?A: For the simple fact that he was at the time a IX OTO And, therefore, could only be expelled by a tribunal constituted by Reis World.Following with the list of reinvindicantes have: In Switzerland, Hermann Metzger who was, according to some authors, OHO illegally elected by his followers, that is, by members of his Own. Metzger had been initiated into the Order (Mysteria Mystica Veritas) during the Second World War. It was one of the survivors student members of OTO Switzerland, led by Theodor Reuss.In 1940, Germer, the system began in Thelemite. Metzger worked for several years in a row under the supervision of Frederic Mellinger, high degree of order. It is our understanding that Germer cherished high hopes Metzger. However, many of these hopes have not been realized until after the death of Germer. Over the years he received other appointments: Grand Master of the Ordo Illuminatorum, Grand Master of the Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua to Switzerland, and Patriarch of the Gnostic Catholic Church. Theodor Reuss and Engel were the founders of Ordo Illuminatorum but parted in 1902 .The first joined Hertmann and Klein, the other remained in the Ordo Illuminatorum until 1931, when he died. His place"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"was taken by a certain Mier.When voting Metzger became Outer Head, the fact was not communicated to his superior (Frederic Mellinger), not to be late and indirectly. Mellinger as co-executor of Germer on matters relating to the OTO , can do nothing to repair the act of Metzger, even though you have tried. It is extremely unlikely that we can undo some initiatives in this particular field. Anyone, at any time, can be said OHO of OTO or the senior living being in AA, not anyone can do anything about. But who assumes the consequences of their actions and statements. We see that even expelled from the OTO , K. Grant continued to perform as a member and leader of the Order. This continues today, and nothing can be done. No court of the external world has the power to prevent this. In case metzger, the problem much more complicated, because in addition to being a High Graduated in the Order, he had other titles giving him support.Metzger is presented by Marcelo Motta as one of those fools who have convinced themselves to be the \"Magical Child\" promised in AL. In a letter dated March 23, 1965, Frater Parzival (MRM), seeks to show the folly of that brother to his claim. Whether or not Metzger gave ear to the words of Parzival we do not know. However, the actual Marcelo Motta, in turn, assumes that this' Magic Son \". It's all a matter of perspective or, in the words of many, quite confusing ...In the United States, arises Grady McMurtry - Hymenaeus Alpha * (The Marriage Fool, as he dubbed Crowley, in his forceful mood). Oddly enough McMurtry just learned of the death of Germer seven months after the disengagement. Addition, one can only conclude three things: either he did not care for his Superior, or was not as \"connected\" to the Order, or the OTO in the USA were, at the time, totally disorganized, or dormant . McMurtry started out in the famous \"Agape Lodge\". Being North American Army officer during the Second World War, he embarked for England in the service. Meeting with Crowley, that has forwarded the Secret Order of Central, making him a member of IX (1946). - T. * Note: One of the many ironies of Crowley. Himself had chosen the Moto Magic Murtry, who did not understand that when Crowley chose this bike was mocking the initiative to MacMurtry marry. Hymenaeus (Marriage in Greek) and Alpha (the letter of the Trump 0 = The Fool). But, all of which can be seen in two ways, it could be said that Crowley gave this bike to Murtry to realize that he (MacMurtry) would hit the Union with \"The Fool\", that is, who had attained the Way of the Fool, connecting Chokmah the Kheter and therefore someone who had crossed the Abyss. Marriage is Agapé = 31, the same value for Thelema (Will). The Qabalah is a game of numbers and letters based on which we can deduce what we want, especially what we particularly like.In consequence of the death of Germer, McMurtry used two \"letters of emergency\" given to him by Crowley, proclaiming himself \"Calipha\" and world leader of the Order. A version stating that McMurtry bought Patent Ninth Degree. This should not offend anyone. It was a common occurrence in the various Masonic orders exist. In fact the orthodox Freemasonry itself was common (buy Patent). We, however, doubt that Crowley has agreed with this \"sale\", even if it had anything to McMurtry, as stated by several authors. But if the sale was made, then we could deduce there, behind the scenes, something very important for Crowley did so.However, throughout this history what we call more attention is the fact that McMurtry has only had news of the death of Germer, after seven months. The news was given by Mildred Burligame. But in 1985, McMurtry mind to say, before the Judge of Court of California, that being in Washington, DC, was only informed of the death of Germer in 1968.In Haiti. In 1963, Jean Maine met Michael Bertieux and introduces the OTO , charging him to organize a branch of the Order in the United States entirely independent of that which was led by Germer, until 1962, and in America South Bertieux Michael was the leader of an organization \"secret\" called \"Monastery of the Seven Rays,\" which includes the \"Cult of the Black Snake\" (La Couleuvre Noire), a type of Voodoo. In this fan, Kenneth Grant turned up recently. Here we can see how much the OTO has become the land of nobody.In the same year, and due to the state of Ortier, Jean Maine is consecrated Patriarch and Head of the OTO A. (Ordo Templi Orientis Antiqua), and in 1970 the post goes to Bertieux. Another OTO comes now with an \"A\" added to the acronym.In Canada, one of the most important disciples of Crowley, C. Jones (Frater Achad), was initiated in the OTO , and in 1948, one year after the death of Crowley, and based on the development of their own research of the Book of Law, announces the Aeon of Maat - forty years after the Equinox of the Gods by Crowley announced in 1904, when Aiwass proclaimed the birth of the New Aeon, which should last about"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2000 years. Frater Achad called the New Age of MA-ION, the Aeon of Truth and Justice. Achad signed his theory of Ma-Ion over a 'revelation' which, he says, found in the Book of the Law - just in the last verse of the Cap . I. The circumstances surrounding this story are too technical to be discussed here. But, somehow, are very important for Thelemites.One has to admit that Frater Achad was completely obsessed with the idea of being a new messiah, powerful enough to redeem man from his calamities arising from the Aeon of Horus, which, judging by his private correspondence, Achad, attributed to the machinations of Aiwass . After a certain time, Ahad has considered Aiwass as a demon.Everything indicates that Achad tried to \"Atravessia the Abyss\", and then it showed strong characteristics of madness. But this is another story that I'd rather discuss on another occasion. What is important is that many have subscribed to theories of Achad and thereby created a new branch of OTO following the precepts of the Aeon of Maat.Kenneth Grant apendeu your organization a group intended to develop these lines. This, and most other things, resulted in the \"Cult of Lam,\" in which the \"gods lovecraftianos\" are worshiped. Achad was patented by Theodor Reuss, not by Crowley, as judged by many. It was one of the IX thereof, together with Crowley and Tränker. The most important fact is that his career has found the Key of the Book of the Law, and considered by Crowley himself, his Son Magic.In Brazil, Marcelo Ramos Motta (Frater Parzival XI), the beloved disciple of Germer, disregards Kenneth Grant as OHO, separates the English founded a Lodge, proclaiming himself leader World Order and direct successor to Germer, based the last words spoken by Germer, on his deathbed. These words were answered by Sascha. Germer (Germer's wife) in a letter dated October 30, 1962:\"The Marcelo Motta:Our beloved Master is dead. He succumbed to October 25th at 22h 55min in horrible circumstances. follower you (\"The Follower\", in English). Please accept it from me, because he died in my arms and was his last will. \"Much later, Marcelo Motta ve been forced to change the name of your organization OTOfor S. OTO - Ordo Templi Orientis Society (with branches in the United States and Australia) for legal reasons. Marcelo Motta died in 1987 in the city of Teresopolis (State of Rio de Janeiro). Died only.His body was only found by the cleaning lady, one day after his death. His remains lie in the cemetery of that mountain town. According to information I obtained from your neighbors, was a woman who took care of all the funeral expenses. We did not obtain the identification of this woman. However, due to certain events that occurred recently, we now know that this woman was Claudia Cannuto (Soror KA).These are, briefly, the events after the death of Germer.Q: After the death of Marcelo Motta in Brazil and McMurtry in the United States of America, as was the OTO ?A: As you are aware, my interest in the occult (or Esoteric, use the word he sees fit) goes back to my youth, when I had the opportunity to read many authors, among which highlight: Eliphas Levi, Blavatsky, Lytton , Krumm-Heller, Annie Besant, Papus, Prentice Mulford, Jorge Adoun, etc.. Also this time my attraction to secret orders: Rosa Cruz, Freemasonry, and more. In this way I started working in Freemasonry (Grand Orient of Brazil), the FRA, the Brazilian Theosophical Society, the OTO , and finally in AAMy first contact with Thelema took place at the beginning of the sixties, when reading \"CALLING THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN\", authored by Marcdelo Ramos Motta - being the first Brazilian publication dealing with the Law of Thelema openly, and presenting organizations linked to the system. In this book, Marcelo Motta presented as Preamonstrator of AA, one of the most important initiatic orders entered into the system. Attracted by the contents of the book, I wrote immediately to the author, requesting my membership in one of the orders presented there. The rest of the story you know very well.Remained under instruction from Marcelo Motta until 1975, when I was suspended-Order for \"misconduct\" (see \"Equinox of the Gods\" - Being The Equinox in Brazil Endnote - pag.153 and 154-1976). Off the branch Marcelo Motta called me the English branch of Kenneth Grant with which, some time before, had contacted through their own Marcelo Motta. This seems to be an irony of fate ..."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Up ahead I joined the American branch, led by Hymenaeus Beta. My stay with Grant was not lasting. I still thought at the time that the order was a single block. Later realizing what was happening, and did not agree with the actions of Kenneth Grant, I stepped away from your organization, giving rise he sent me a manifesto, in which recorded my shutdown OTO Typhonian (1992). Already in 1975 founded the New Aeon Society, and I started this organization to disclose Thelema in Brazil within my means. At this time the Caliphado was still unknown in our country. In 1995 I started working in that branch, with which relations have kept until 1996, when I asked my shutdown, returning my Patent. Two reasons made me take this approach: First, my initiation was performed using the rituals of OTO published by Francis King. Disillusioned with, and knowing the implications of this fact, I was in the right to disconnect me from Caliphado; Second: I did not agree with the appointment of Mr. Marcelo Santos as Master of the Camp. This appointment should have been offered to someone else - so I thought at the time. But now I realize the error of this, my attitude toward Mr. M. Santos (Frater I.)Given these events took, of its own accord, the position of Frater Superior to Brazil, continued my work in promoting the Order using me Society New Aeon as the material basis. I was a right fit as IX OTO , Zelator of AA, and started the Order of Thelema. In 1966, along with other Frati and Sorores who stayed by my side, I created the OCT (Knight of the Order of Thelema), working on an order Masonic system, but with Rituals developed by Marcelo Ramos Motta, in the 70s. In this work we adopt some ideas of Frater Achad and Jack Parsons, by judging them of interest to the Order and being within the guidelines Thelemites. Some rituals were modified, reworked within the Law of Thelema and following particular observations, given to me by Frater Parzival.Q. Marcelo Motta had other followers?A: Of course. It is a mistake to think that I was the only disciple him in the period between 1962 and 1976. When he died he left three successors. One was B.Stone which according learned through a special correspondence between us, he said, it seems that the work of AAnos United States. Another, named William Barden, emigrated to Australia, creating the Foundation Parzival XI. According to information from authoritative person, William Barden is crazy. Convinced the remaining group of S. OTO to follow him. Using the powers granted to it by this group, improperly sold a lot of works of Marcelo Motta thrusts in Brazil custody Store Nuit. Belatedly members found this Store fraud. But at this point, he managed to get elected \"General Overseer\" and began to exercise his \"authority.\"The third heir was Cannuto Claudia, a valuable Soror Marcelo Motta who accompanied him to death. Claudia Cannuto is an Adept of the Great Order and IX OTO Claudia relinquished his appointment as heir, moved away and now his whereabouts are \"unknown\".But there is a fourth crown in Brazil, of which little is known, but has carefully followed the steps Instructor.

How do you see the OTO now?A: It seems to me that in some branches of the Order is an ongoing process of transmutation and resurrection on higher planes. The responsibility for or against this transmutation should, as appropriate, to fall on their heads. However, I have also observed that other branches bowed to the attacks of the Black Lodge (please do not confuse with Black Fraternity, which is something quite different.).Q. Can you explain?A: When the Sword of Islam arose in the \"Holy Land\" against the achievements of the Church of Rome, some secret societies, masquerading as mystical organizations, absorbed the knowledge Harraniano and allied themselves secretly to the Black Lodge . Both the Knights Templar as Hassan-i-Sabah (better known as \"The Killers\") gave intense fight these demonic orders. However, these groups Riders were infiltrated and influenced by disciples of the \"Great Sorcery\" that eventually started a company Magica purely cristista. Years after the Crusades, King Philip of France, to be denied entry into the Order of the Temple , joined the ranks of this Black Order and managed to destroy in part the Templars, with the obvious help of Rome.Obtained their purpose, the agents of the Great Sorcery, founded spurious Masonic organizations and began a campaign against the Royal fraternities, penetrating several of them, taking advantage of the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"weakness of their leaders. This campaign was already long ages, becoming stiffer and powerful during the historical period called the Dark Ages. The Inquisition represented one of the strongest arms in this fraternity.The Black Lodge uses methods derived from the Great Order to confuse the unwary, and pretends to accept Liber AL vel Legis, but reject and misrepresent as much as Liber OZ, which affect certain \"explanations\" and \"comentos\" clearly grounded in concepts crististas. This is what I call thélemismo.In recent years, the deterioration of said secret orders and fraternities, binds directly to the spiritual level reached by their leaders. All that these leaders, for lack of a base grounded in tangent to their moral qualities, ethical, and more or less open to penetration agents of the Black Lodge, failed to do in prol of your orders and members of the same, is beginning to its fruits. Do not include these leaders who, in so doing, open the door for that damn Black Order enters the \"magic circle of their organizations\" greatly weakened by their own actions.Thus, the esoteric movement that requires, above all, quality rather than quantity, turned into superstition, hocus-pocus and dilettantism of fools. Recent events show the accuracy of this statement. Severity of time should make us think and rethink about the causes that led us to this situation, and how we ought to act in the future to avoid further disaster - if it is still possible within the current frame.Q: Could you provide some other factor contributing to this situation, especially in the OTO ?R.: Some time ago, an acquaintance, but not much esteemed, occult connected to Thelemic system, alerted everyone to the fact that that Fiat insisted on maintaining its structure, layout Masonic Osirian, she was doomed to total failure. And that he was perfectly attuned to the thought of Crowley, when he wrote to Karl Germer in a letter dated March 14, 1942:\"I will state my successor with OHO but on special terms. It is quite clear to me that a complete change in the structure of the Order, and its methods is necessary ... \"It is true that Crowley himself tried to open a new branch in the structure of the Order under his leadership, but he could not extricate himself from the masonic structure, with its apparatus, patents, secret signs, words pass, rituals conferring degrees, etc.. De Indeed, many aspects of the new system was infused in the new rituals of various degrees, but the Masonic influence was not completely removed, unfortunately.Q: Why did this happen?A: It is quite clear why this Masonic influence Osirian remained. During the last years of the nineteenth century, and the first of the current, when the \"modern occult revival\" seems to have gained momentum, many of the occult groups that emerged were started by men strongly linked to Freemasonry Osirian. It is also fact that the vast majority of the leaders of these organizations were mation, carrying with them concerns about patents, degrees, password, secret words, signs, etc. .. everything as told by the costumes of Freemasonry. But you must agree that any degree structure is - or should be - purely functional. It would simply be a means of orderly progress through a course work. But this is a means archaic. Besides, the functional degrees are viewed as actual claims of a \"spiritual status\", which are not in reality. And if people hold themselves to these old concepts, then it makes good sense to abolish this scheme steps. Nobody can ignore the undeniable fact that Crowley himself was himself deeply immersed in the ancient patriarchal scheme Aeon Osiris. He, like most occultists then, was the product of this scheme, and I seem to have been unable to get rid of the structural idea of the Old Aeon. You may well find it to closely observe the limited renewal of the Order, made by him, to assume leadership of the stores that accepted the Thelemite system as a basis for their work. Later, seeing the mistake, he tried to reform everything, but little time was left. Hence the letter to Germer. Germer, meanwhile, felt the great difficulty of the work and, perhaps, as would be fruitless to try. Besides, was not very interested in the OTO , as we all know. Draw your own conclusions about it, and try to connect these facts to the strange posture Germer (and testament) in relation to the Order. An example of the prediction that occult mentioned earlier this issue was correct, is evident in the days of today. There is no argument against the fact. It is paradoxical but true that despite the numerous existing organizations, ranking Thelemites, exalt predicates System, continue to consolidate their bases in the former Masonic system.Moreover, the state of mind accompanying members of these organizations is an infantile arrogance proclaiming: \"I know, and those who do not agree with this my knowledge are wrong and they are my enemies\" once wrote me a renowned instructor Thelemite:\"I now want to set, to avoid future misunderstandings, my position regarding OTO :"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"It is not my intention that the rituals of the OTO , Crowley's writings are used in any form of work Shop. This ritual was considered insufficient by TO MEGA THERION Himself, and as a result were given to the public. Every attempt to open a branch of OTO rituals using these failed. The reason for this injunction is that these rituals, among other things, Crowley attempted to establish a bridge between the old aeon and the Aeon of Horus.This is impossible. The passage of the Aeons is always catastrophic.Q. Is there any connection between the Thelemic Orders and Order Rosicrucian?R.: Which \"Rosicrucian Order\" you refer to? There are several \"orders Rosicrucian\" performing in the world. And each one is unique and true saying. Firstly I must tell you that these such orders (or fraternities) are a decoy. Closer examination shows that only manifests from Johan Valentine Andreia is additional documentation that came German and French Englishwoman discussing the Rosy Cross.Before, there was nothing in this regard. Incidentally, the fact is undeniably true, confessed by the Andreia, he was the author of the book called \"Chemical Wedding\", attributed to such Christian Rozenkreutz. anonymous work called The \"Fame\" was published in 1624, trying to reassert the myth in order to answer those who, even at that time, claimed his proven false origin. Notice what Franz Hartmann tells us in \"An Adventure Among The Rosicrucians\": \"The name of the Rosicrucian Order Rosicrucian or Golden is a relatively modern invention and has been used by Yohan V. Andreia, who invented the story of the \"Chemical Wedding\" Christian Rozenkreutz for the same reasons they also invented Cervantes' Don Quixote de La Mancha \", mainly for the purpose of ridiculing fans, wizards, alchemists and reformers of his time, when he wrote his famous \"Fama\".Q. Could you explain in more detail?R.: The work of Franz Hartmann is a fictional story about an imaginary Rosicrucian idealized by him. Does not refer to an organization where the author actually been. believe there is no need to talk to you about the many \"Rosicrucian orders\" in the world.Some of them even claiming Thomaz de Aquino was Rosicrucian, implying that the \"holy\" Roman Catholic rosacrucionismo passed. This bullshit started in France in 1888, and does not support the most basic critical because not supported by historical facts but the interpretation vicious. Currently, some \"Rosicrucians\" link René Descartes as a member of their order. If so he would never have written \"Discourse on Method\", which highlights the common sense as one of the greatest features in scientific work. Among the most famous \"esoteric\" and \"Rosicrucian\" constantly cited in esoteric works, we find Sir Bulwer -Lytton, Samuel McGregor Mathers, Max Heindell, Krumm-Heller (Frau) Sprengel, and others. Let us quickly review what we really know about them:Bulwer Lytton, was fully immersed in a mixture of \"Christianity / Nazism.\" See \"The Last Days of Pompeii,\" a novel in which he describes the triumph of Christianity over Paganism. In \"The people Overcoming What's In\", he emphasizes the idea of a \"master race\", just like the Nazis with the supposed pure Aryans. Are past decades, and this people 'superior' to date has not appeared or emerged from the immense caves they inhabit (the same for Agarthianos STB). And it appeared, was defeated in World War II.Samuel Liddell McGregor Mathers. As some claim, a great start. Invented a \"story\" so ridiculous about \"the Secret\" which ended up being ridiculed by members of the Golden Dawn, the order founded by him, Rosicrucian characteristics. This order did not last long, becoming, nowadays, a laughingstock among the most serious scholars. And if we give ear to gossip, would have been A. Crowley who destroyed the order, simply publishing the secret rituals used by it.Max Heindell was a mushy Christian who spoke, spoke, but said nothing of importance or concrete. If I'm not mistaken his \"Rosicrucian Order\" no longer exists, or has become almost totally unknown.Krumm-Heller. This one started in real OTO , who left to glamorize the ego, and founded the FRA, against the advice of their Masters. Nowadays this Order at least in Brazil, is rapidly decay and not resisting the attacks of the Black Lodge, moved away from the system Thelemite.Anna Sprengel (Frau). Never has there been such a woman (or adept). It was a brazen invention of the creators of the Golden Dawn, to support that order. Crowley was one of the initiates in order. He and Bennett were perhaps the only ones who truly achieved a real initiation.And so on, we could follow the trail of these \"masters Rosicrucians.\"Q. Who was Christian Rozenkreutz?"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"A.: It is said that Christian Rozenkreutz was a very pious priest who lived in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. After acquiring great knowledge and wisdom during a long journey through the Orient. He returned to Europe (Germany), and founded the Fraternity RC Reportedly died at 106 years of age and the location of his grave was kept secret.According to the report of \"Fame\", this grave was discovered by members of the Brotherhood, and this discovery heralds the dawn of a New Age We have thus a universal mythic motif - the initiatory journey of which the traveler returns transformed and possession of new knowledge and wisdom. It's always the same story we see repeated in every corner of the world: someone leaves for exile, or a long and dangerous journey, and back totally changed, connoisseur of great secrets, etc.. and invariably gives rise to a new religion or founded an order or brotherhood. It is the story of Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Blavatsky, Karl Kellner, etc..Q. How could these 'orders Rosicrucians' create as much fame and credibility among the people?R: are well known techniques used by these instructions, fraternity, etc.. To impose credulity. The main one is saying and doing among the unwary to believe that the order comes from time immemorial, the greatest men and women of the world were the brotherhood. In this wave of ancestry embark all those looking for something beyond their monotonous lives. AMORC (first cousin of the OTO ), for example, states categorically have its origins in ancient Egypt, and considers the pharaoh Amenophis IV, better known as Akhnatom , the founder of the order, which is, in our view, at least one ridiculous statement. If some people to look at the figure of Amenophis IV (Anknaton), Naked romantic mantle that surrounds it, he would realize it must have been the worst of the Pharaohs, a disaster for the Egyptian civilization, which receded at all during the short time that he reignedQ. What happens to be black fraternity?A.: It is one of the three fraternities that govern our planet (according to others the total Solar System), which together form the Great Brotherhood of Light Brothers The other two are the Brotherhood Yellow and White Brotherhood. These three fraternities are symbolized in the Qabalah, the three sons of Noah, in the New Testament by the Three Wise Men. (Balthasar, Melchior and Gaspar.) The Black Fraternity that all manifestation is necessarily of the nature of suffering, that the aim of man should be, therefore, the depletion of personal karma and absorption in Nirvana. That fraternity was the greatest exponent Gautama Buddha. His book is the Canon Dhamapada. Whoever men call Gautama or Siddhartha, or Buddha, was a Magus. His Word (ie, Law or Formula announced by him) was ANATTA, because the root of his whole doctrine was that there is no Atman, or Soul, meaning a substance incapable of change. So he, as Lao-Tze, all based on a movement, rather than a fixed point. A Yellow Fraternity that every manifestation being forcibly settled up, must have reason to be, and that therefore the aim of man should be plastically adapt to the conditions of manifestation friction, and never presume to modify, in one way or another, the processes of Nature. The greatest exponent of this fraternity was Lao Tzu and his book canon was the Book of Tao. A White Brotherhood maintains that the aim of man is to become what one called Madame Blavatsky Nirmanakaia, that the Great Work is the progressive transmutation, first of personal metals into gold, after the planetary metals into gold, and finally the universal metals into gold, and that the purpose and the Adept should be fun to make the desert bloom in beauty and perfume. The greatest exponent of this fraternity was and is the Great Beast of Revelation, and his book canon, that is not yours, but belongs to Our Lady of the Stars, the Divine Fire and Solar Child, is the Book of the Law And because you do not You have got Wisdom does not know whether these three fraternities that always antagonize and compete with each other, make one or make three.Q. Who was Lao Tse?R.: Lao-Tse came into the world and said that he could be conceived Tao is not the true Tao. Therefore, men gathered and, after his death, made a Savior of Lao-Tse, and today the book is a dupe of fools and pedants.Q. Who was Buddha?R.: Buddha came into the world, and said that there was neither salvation nor savior, that pain and maceration do not lead man to divine peace, that every manifestation is necessarily of the nature of suffering, and that the essence of wisdom is the extinction .Therefore, men gathered and, after his death, made a Savior Buddha, penance in his name, and begged him to lead them to liberation."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Q. Who was Dionysus?R.: Dionysus came into the world, he, Osiris Risen, and taught men that in the generation process, with his death and resurrection, is contained in the supreme mystery of the construction of the Temple of the Holy Spirit, the Word manifested in flesh, the United on Earth. And so men love-under many names, including that of Jesus, and beg him to lead them to salvation. And yet, help you, that God will help you, says the wisdom of the people.Q. Who was Mohammed?R.: Mohammed came into the world and partially destroyed the great sorcery of the Black Lodge, engendered after the extinction of methodical exoteric Gnostic Church, and persecution that lasted twenty centuries of the Gnostic Esoteric Church. Glory to Mohhamed, Sword of God! Partial prophet, yet prophet, the Unity of God and man's virility. And now you are told: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the LawQ. Who was Thoth?R.: Thoth (but really Tahuti) came into the world and said that wisdom consists in the mind of a structuralizing so organic, so flexible and fluid so that the mind becomes a vehicle for adquado Creative Word. Therefore, men gathered and, after his death, made a Savior of Thoth, and His Book is now partly used as a basis for indoor games. Thoth, or Tahuti confirmed the Word of Dionysus by continuing it, so he showed how it is possible to go through the mind of Will Operations. Criteria for the registration and Memory Man avoids error, and repetition of error. But the true Word of Tahuti was AMOUN. Whereby He made Men to understand their secret nature, ie, Unity with their true Selves, or, as they then expressed it, with God. And He will unveiled the path of this achievement, and the relationship of this path with the formula INRI. Also, for your Mystery Number he made it easy for his successor to declare the nature of the entire universe in its form and structure, like an analysis of this, making the Matter what the Buddha was appointed to the Mind. (A.Crowley).Q. What is Christ?R.: Christ comes from the Greek word Chrestus, meaning Anointed Greek System.Q. Who is Jesus?A: It is a Hebrew word (IHShVH - Shin Yod He Vau He) which also means \"Anointed One.\"Derives from the Sacred Tetragrammaton YHVH, adding the letter Shin (Sh) in their midst, thus: IH (Sh) VH. This letter Shin (numeric value 300) represents both the Fire Element and the Element Spirit. Placed in the center of the Sacred Tetragrammaton, means that the Spirit \"dominates\" or \"balances\" the Four Blind Forces of the Demiurge.Thus, Jehovah's Word - the Word of Moses - becomes Jeheshua - the Word of Jonas.Q. What becomes, then, \"Jesus Christ\"?R.: \"It is a hybrid name the titles by which the Essenes and Gnostics, respectively called the Initiate who had reached the sphere Tiphareth - to say the Sephira, or\" Plan of Consciousness \"which, in the System of A. ' . A. '. corresponds to the Grade of Adeptus Minor, and in Masonry (Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite) to 33 degree. This in other words means that the Initiate has reached the level of a Christ (Anointed). Though the Church of Rome has stolen this name to create the \"Jesus\" of it, there is nothing more holy and pure than this hides the name .Q. Who is Jesus?R.: Is any Adept, or better said, any individual (man or woman) who has attained the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian AngelQ: Who is Jesus Christ?A: It is the name used by the Roman Church to create a version of liar LOGOS OF AEON OF OSIRIS, whose Word is INRI, and Thelemites know under the name of Dionysus.Q. What is Aeon?A: The term was used by Aeon Gnostics meaning the hierarchy of beings in the universe.Aeon can also be fragments of duration or periods of time and spatially substantiated, elements or characters in a mythological drama."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Q: Who is Christ?A: It's all Adept System Greek, whose name matches the Essene Jeheshua. In practice it is the title used to designate the LOGOS AIONOS.Q. Who was Perdutabo?R.: Perdurabo bike is simply magical A. Crowley in the Golden Dawn. Perdurabo to say: \"I will endure to the end.\" But if we pay more attention in order to see that nothing had to endure ... The name ends in an \"O\" - Zero - Nothing - Perdurab (o).Q. What is Freemasonry Orthodox or Osirian?A.: It is that order semi-secret rituals based on the legend of Hiram Abiff, the builder of the Temple of Solomon. The legend is the same Hiran Osiris and Jesus, with some variations. Many Masonic Orders are not \"Freemasonry\".Q. What is the Tree of Life?A: It is a geometrical framework where are allocated the Ten Sephiroth (plural of Sephira) or Divine Emanations. According to Crowley \"is the most complete symbolic scheme of Man and the Universe, and the interrelationship between the two. The Tree of Life or Tree Calvary, is the basis of practical Qabalah.Q. What is Sephira?A: It is a Hebrew word, and can be translated as \"Emanation\" or \"Number\". The Sephiroth (plural of Sephira) are emanations of divinity in its \"fall\" or condensation to create the visible universe.Q. How many Sephiroth exist?Answer: There are Ten Sephiroth visible and invisible, called Daath. Daath is considered by many occultists as a false Sephira. Others say he is the Portal of the Abyss. Daath begins with the letter \"D\" (Daleth). Daleth in Hebrew means \"window\". The Sephiroth are the following: 1 - Kether 2 - Chockmah 3 - Binah 4 - Chesed 5 - Geburah 6 - Tiphareth 7 - Netzah 8 - Hod 9 - Yesod -Malkuth 10Q.

Islam may, from one point of view, be regarded as a \"bridge\" between these two Aeons.Q: What comes to be, after all, the Black Lodge?A: Initially we must repeat that the Black Lodge has nothing to do with the Black Fraternity. They are two completely different things. menstruation Shop black is one that stated at the Council of Nicaea. It is the (dis) order or chaos formed by Brother Black, whose major is represented by the priests of the Roman Church Alexandrina, especially the Jesuits. The Black Lodge combating the evolution of humanity, and for this demand, in every possible way, to keep man in ignorance and under the control of their abominable dogmas, taking away the freedom to exercise the True Will. The most damning dogma created by these people (if we are) is that the \"original sin\", the fruit of all cargo guilt complex that prevents us thousands of years to accomplish Our Will as divine beings and that we are free. The Black Lodge is a perversion. It is what remains constant war against the White Lodge, but as I said, this has nothing to do with the Black Fraternity, or Yellow, which are part of Big Brother Brotherhood of the Light Being a member of the Black Lodge not to say, at all, that such a person is poor in the ordinary sense"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"of the word that we or our society believes.

However, from the point of view initiation are undesirable achievements. The forces of the subtle planes should be used to increase our knowledge and ability in those plans, not to restore the physical health or prolong our exist6encia material, or in raising the call good luck in terms of fame, fortune and love. As I said earlier, if I'm not mistaken, all the magic is not directed to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is black magic."}]
