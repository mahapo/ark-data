[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The GOLDEN GATELa-Ahad Al-back to talk.After a thousand years, he returns with his chest heaving of Love. An immense Love, directed all beings and things.He returns taken by Infinite Passion: The Notebook full of joys.He shouts, and his passionate cry resounds fields and mountains, deserts and seas.At night, under the stars, the name resonates. Name thousand times already known and whispered in splendor Afternoon. Name that sweetens the eager lips of Kisses Her.He sees the flowers silvestrees between the Garden of Delights.Her hair shines in the sunlight, and their eyes fixed is the blue sky.In his pupils plays the brightness of stars.The sun rises the picture becomes rose petals that gentle morning breeze blows the Infinite.He remains in Sacred Meditation.O Goddess, Incarnation of Heaven, unties the ties that forever bind me on this earth. Let me fly beyond the stars, by Endless Space of Your Body - Your Palace of Delights.I CAN OPEN THAT GOLDEN GATE.O Pearl resting on velvet Scarlet Oyster opens.Diving in the deep Te can achieve.I throw myself on the sparkling Sea looking for you. I let myself sink deeply ... and touch the pearl.There remains only one NAME Thy lips that murmur beyond the edge of the Stars."}]
