[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE TAO TEH KINGThe Tao Teh King was written nearly five hundred years BC (the so-called Christian Era).It was written by a man named Lao Tse, Lao or Lao Tan Kun. This man was over eighty years old when he wrote the Tao. He was for many years Curator of the Royal Library, very important position. Disgusted with the decay of statecraft in China, and especially with the conduct of their king, Lao decided to leave the country. Had, I repeat, at least eighty years old, and had never set foot outside China. But, he decided to live in Mongolia, and headed to the Great Wall to the Guardian requesting passage of Borders.Lao Tse had never written anything, yet was considered one of the most profound thinkers of the nation. The Guardian of the Borders informed him, with that characteristic subtlety Chinese, that he could not allow a man of his ability to pass the border without leaving something to summarize, for future generations, your thinking and your wisdom.Even quoted an old law that was not allowed to any scholar who had occupied an official position in government hierarchy without leaving the country code before, for the Royal Library, a testament to the intellectual and political. Guardian This gesture of Borders was subtle because Lao Tse was a Master of the Tao, whose main characteristic is the silence, and did not in any other circumstances, writing anything. But there were three fundamental reasons, the condition imposed by the Guardian of the Borders, sufficient to talk a Taoist. First, the Guardian was quoting a law, and second, the Guardian was Lao Tse reminding that this was, until recently, been Real Librarian, and was, so to speak, a consequence of this position will be required to write something for the library and thirdly, Lao Tse wanted to leave China and go to Mongolia, and the easiest, most efficient, quietest achieve this desire at the moment to speak. And therefore, Lao Tse \"spoke\" - that is, wrote the Book of Tao. So Lao Tse entered the Mongolian wild and inhospitable, against the attacks of the civilized tribes whose Chinese had raised this wonder never surpassed in terms of fortification, the Great Wall. Mentioned in the Book of Tao? Of statecraft - the art simplest and most neglected of the world, the art that, as was practiced in China, kept alive and united a culture for seven thousand years - longer than any other nation has ever endured in human history. Remember here that even Egypt lasted less - your records do not reach beyond five thousand years. Thirdly comes the Japan Lao Tse wrote the book in mind their king (whose conduct the disliked so much that decided to leave China) and the future kings of China - we will not say the \"hope\" that you follow the advice, but to grant them the opportunity to do so, if they wanted. But China's rulers would not follow the advice of Lao Tse - and the result was a nation that had lasted seven thousand years in a few centuries was conquered by barbarians from Mongolia, and transformed into the empire of the Khans. Maybe it's just coincidence, the fact that Lao Tse left China to go live in Mongolia. The first prerequisite to govern well a nation is to learn to govern itself. This is a truism, and truisms are often neglected. But the Book of Tao, as anyone can see, teaches to do precisely this, and is, in the words of the wise, \"the supreme masterpiece of wisdom initiation. This definition - initiatory wisdom - can lead the skeptic and the materialist suspicious that this Book of the Tao is silly mystical worthless. This is unfortunate, because it is precisely the skeptic and the materialist who else can profit from the practical application of the precepts of Lao Tse. I say this because I notice that skeptics and materialists are, in general, men deeply intelligent, morally courageous (requires a lot of courage to live without the support Image Paterna, usually called \"God\") and eminently practical, just the sort of man ruling would have more success, and that would be of more benefit to the people to take over the government. Far be it mystical nonsense, the Book of Tao is an eminently practical set of principles that should be applied in the daily life of everyone who wants to know that reality which Lao Tse called the Tao, and which unfailingly well applied, will produce immediate results and surprising. But how is this possible? Ask the skeptical and materialistic. How can I, \"doing nothing\", getting what you want to be done? How can I, \"concealing me\" shine? How can I improve the lives of the people \"shutting me?\" How can I get to a position of command without fighting, without speaking, without work? The basis of the doctrine of the Tao is the following: The Universe is a continuum. All men exist as concentrations of energy, islands, so to speak, in the eternal sea of the cosmos.A wire connects the basic unit in a universal harmony governs all our destinies, if we want to, we can say that we are all, at some level of consciousness, a state of empathy with each other. Our conscious mind perceives in its normal state for most of us, this constant communication, this constant empathy, but not for it leaves our unconscious at some deep level, to feel it and experience it. In fact, all communication between humans would be impossible if there existed such a loop, because language, as proof logic, is not an efficient communication of ideas, is, itself, a process the disjointed nonsense, a simple convention which depends for its use of a mutual agreement between minds that employ.This thesis - the universe is a continuum - is basic in physics, and not even by quantum theory - as quanta need, they same, a field for its propagation. Universe Being a continuum, with men in constant communication with each other, it follows that there is no need to speak to communicate with our neighbors. Rather, there is a more efficient method of communication, which consists in using this \"cord\" of empathy that unites each other and that"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"makes us, as it were siblings. This phenomenon should not be confused with telepathy which is an activity of the conscious mind, and of which Lao Tse would have frowned upon as much as any other form of disturbance. But since this \"thread\" is a level of consciousness which, our ordinary state, we do not become conscious, we must, if we want to use it for communication, we abandon the methods \"normal\" communication and in this \"normal\" level, we keep quiet. This thesis apparently amazing, is a fact, but should be verified by practice, and the verification is always individual. It is useless ye believe in what I say - your faith in me will not become able to \"talk quietly\" thy neighbor. It must appliques rules Lao Tse, and that check, on your own experience, the reality of what was said. BUT - you will say - I want to directly govern men. I want to sit on a throne. I want to be elected president of the republic, for which there is no good. Ah! .... This is what you want, or rather what you think you want, BUT THIS IS WHAT THE WORLD WANTS? In other words: we \"think\" we the people need that we governemos, but do the people really need it. We want to govern the people, but that people will WANT TO BE GOVERNED BY U.S.?For the TAO is the intrinsic reality of things, it can only become ruler of a people applying TAO which is, in a certain season of the ruling Movement Universal natural and necessary that people."}]
