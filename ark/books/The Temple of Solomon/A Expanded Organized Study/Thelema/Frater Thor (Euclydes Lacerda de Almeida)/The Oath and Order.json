But the worst are those attacks in disguise, or performed in the night, or cowardly from behind.Now that these attacks are the result either of the allies of the Great Fraud of own damn organization wants, no matter. Of all the most masterly maneuvers, used by followers of fraud, that is to disguise himself; impersonate by allies, friends, etc.. And they do it with great perfection. You only realize the true intentions of them when the dagger is already locked on his back.An example of this ability to conceal itself like a chameleon, stamp on some loose sheets that recently were sent to us (we do not know by whom) containing excerpts from a work discussing an alleged history of Thelemic Orders developing in Brazil . Do not have the author's name, but he introduces himself as \"devoted\" Thelemite. Assume to be another one of those \"useful innocents\" manipulated by the Great Fraud.In the leaves, we sent, we can identify some excerpts copied from authors really Thelemites, but the content of these texts is greatly distorted in order to give support to the author's ideas about the history of Thelema in Brazil. At the end of reading the pages, even before the seriousness of the problem, our"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"immediate reaction summed up in a good laugh all the available the nonsense contained therein. Apparently the author of the work knows nothing of occultism, and even worse, is under the false impression of being knowledgeable of the subject matter expert and is connected to a real Thelemic Order - which is not true, of course ... For this and other reasons that Crowley said: \"There are no limits to the abyss and idiocies that false wise we want to start.\"As said, we have no idea of the identity of the author of that drivel written \"History of Thelemic Orders in Brazil\", but even so, I would advise you not to write any more about Thelema line, preferably about anything similar off their limited knowledge: grow and appear! as my instructor said. Thus, would prevent more intelligent readers they would suffer fatal seizures of laughter. Actually, I would not deprive readers of hilarious moments, although there is a danger that the more astute will laugh of sadness ... what hope does not happen, \"it remains to be noted that any man comforted or helped his neighbor through choramingagens and sighs\" (Aleister Crowley).Later on we will examine some of the most striking passages of this tribute to the hilarious. It must recognize that most people, if releasing these raptures \"Thelemic\" without the least knowledge in specific harvest initiation, are far, far away from be models of intelligence and knowledge, and the only goofy inspire confidence.The work presented herein is absolutely new, attacks, in the field of historical facts ascertained, the complex problem of the origins and development of the Thelemic Orders, fully satisfying the requirements of a widely experienced rigorous work in a field where the reigning ideological mystifications and fideists prejudices.This study is built based on a first-hand documentation. The most discerning of readers (as long as it does not belong to any groups fanatical) not tarry, to dive into reading, realize that we are not limited to systematize new or rewriting the other buildings, seasoning them and enriching them with our own ideas, quite the contrary, we give life to a completely individual and unique work in the annals Thelemic: a new point of view and will focus on the intricate story of the most serious spiritual achievement system ever offered so freely to all without any limits.Eucydes Lacerda CLARIFICATIONS STARTED We can not make an assessment of Thelema except through a thorough study of the system in all its possible dimensions. Nor can we forget that the Thelemic thought is not new and is not restricted to material organizations as \"orders\", \"fraternities\", etc.. The Thelemic movement is broader and deeper than all these organizations linked to it, and that have been modified (undue) at the whim of the individual characteristics of each group. For example, there are organizations that, while accepting the Law of Thelema, Aleister Crowley did not recognize as a leader to be followed - considering it only as the \"instrument\" by which the law was passed. This case is the Fraternitas Saturni. To Mega Therion accept others as Christ of the New Aeon, without regard to the person of Crowley. Many others to refute completely, so only accepting Liber AL. Others follow the ideas of Frater Achad (C.Stansfield Jones), alleging that Crowley failed Atravessia in the Abyss, and also based on the fact that he was the discoverer Achad Key AL. Others turn to Parsons, and others to Marcelo Motta, and still follow some ideas K.Grant.In fact, the Thelemic movement is in the process of ripening (Horus is a child), and therefore presents still so confused and misunderstood by most people who hear about it, or approach it through the numerous organizations 'Thelemites' existing today.The desire for hegemony and dominance generally by some groups over others, is an obstacle not yet overcome. In some factions that difference of opinion is considered a crime and evidence of the performance of \"forces obsessive\" active. So Thelemites under this charge are \"excommunicated\". Yes, this is the truth - excommunicated! Thus, commits a series of mistakes harmful to the Movement itself evolve as a living force, dynamic and expansive.I have seen some nuclei preach reading \"official\", based solely on the work of Crowley (other authors are"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"prohibited, even if Thelemites) when we all know that any text (whether Thelemite or not) and can be read at any time and freely interpreted in the pursuit of its exact meaning, in order to extract wealth from it all initiatory who happened to have come, incorporating it in our luggage. But those who freely do so, following the dictates of Liber OZ, are reprimanded or prevented from doing so, and that this pattern of coercive conduct to be followed and obeyed, it uses punishment, blackmail, the influence \"hierarchical\", and even political power over other financial groups or independent persons. We thus end in mid-century, a repeat of the famous Roman Inquisition, now under a guise thelemic.Okay particular group, among the best known, tries to maintain iron-fisted monopoly crowleyanas works, and sustains agents in all corners of the world to observe this monopoly anti-Thelemic. However, despite all this surveillance, it allows publication of texts translated badly, because the editors of these publications pay very well by accepting these translations by that group Liberty and Fraternity should be the great bond uniting all organizations Thelemites the world. However, it is discord, limitation, and reciprocal accusations that have become the common denominator between them. If more affluent groups were able to overcome intolerance is characteristic, respecting the thoughts of others, I'm sure, the difficulties preventing the healthy development of Thelema in the world, dissipate like clouds carried by the wind. All it takes is a bit of tolerance, and honesty, it is certain that no one likes to remain in error - unless the brainless.Thelema was never a religion. All I can suggest this vision should be avoided. At the moment we installed a religious belief, bring in its wake intolerance, fanaticism; coagiremos freedom of expression, falsearemos the truth in favor of beliefs, dogmas, etc.. This is a history lesson, and Thelema can not repeat such a mistake. Crowley wrote several letters to Karl Germer, his successor in the OTO and A. '. A.'.Specifically in one of these letters, a little before his death, he warned of the need to be made profound changes in the structure and ritual of the OTO , so that the Order could survive in modern times as a legitimate disclosing the current initiated by him. The warning was not followed either by Germer (but tried to close the Order) and not for his supposed followers. The result was soon to be felt: and today we have a OTO divided, and without the slightest chance to perform, in fact, as a center for the dissemination of legitimate Thelema in external.This work is based on freedom and brotherhood Thelemic. Not a liberty and fraternity hypocrites. So do not want to mislead anyone, nor flatter anyone, and reserves the right to openly say what they observed during 35 years in the Brazilian environment Thelemic.Perhaps more than any other, the change brought about by the attempt massification Esoteric (Esoteric what I call wave), which is further changed the thinking, habits and customs of the majority of people on this end of the century - at least in our country, formed by a people among the most renowned mystics of the world. However this attempt at mass esoteric is an error, and resulted in another kind of discrimination, that is, people divided between two classes: those possessing the power (financial) access to a serious literature (always hard to find and quite face), and do not possess this power, excluding them from any religious change, and social science in the near future.The beginning of this wave of change came in 1962 when, in Brazil, esotericism crawling through a few organizations emerging and very few books (most clearly spiritualist character) could stand up on their legs. Since then, the esoteric thought began to be widely disseminated, not only by a literature increasingly demanded, but also through television and radio, when numerous artists joined the \"wave\" esoteric towards projecting himself personally. And, as always, Esoteric confusing with the \"esoteric\". Thus, in a wrong way, everyone began to make contact with information previously only accessible to the few who have proven able and deserving them.Such \"openness occult\" became, as one would expect a double-edged sword and a panacea for the smartest, because along came the serious stuff those worthless, except to their creators and sellers. And a pile of garbage exoteric and esoteric, mixed without the slightest sense, was thrown over us. The billing has become the sole purpose of those responsible for this avalanche of books, periodicals, magazines, leaflets, \"orders\", \"fraternities\", \"center\", etc.., Presented as if they were Esoteric. The common man found himself approached by a wave of requests, advertising, etc..: Brotherhood and take the \"Red Ray\", \"Purple\", \"Blue\", cabalistic orders, orders Oriental, numerologists, astrologers, kabbalists counselors, consultations tarot, etc.. The situation has reached the absurd, in which a huge amount of \"gurus\", \"magi\", \"initiatic orders\", \"secret orders\", etc.., Began to appear in the media, announcing to the public, his \"powers \"their\" virtues \", their\" ancestral origins \"(preferably Egyptian), and a host of other nonsense, so the taste of the forgers."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Met two men who have become rich exploiting this wave. One selling \"magic crystals\", another reading Tarot. Today, the first resides in Spain, the other enjoys life in Miami.Both with enough dollars in their pockets. All the costs of Muggles who gave him money for ... nothing.We were not alone in this. It goes further. Religions, even the most orthodox, became involved in the plot, and the number of \"innovations\" spurious and false churches, led by \"bishops\" without any ethical, moral and especially spiritual, harmful sprouted like mushrooms in the fertile land attracting the most humble, those most in need of a strong welfare by the government of our country. Meanwhile, the conduct of spiritual poverty, that shame most \"organized Thelemites\" cares \"civic virtue\" and its observance by appearances. If Ra-Hoor-Khuit is the brother or cousin of Hoor-Paar-Kraat, if Horus Ra is greater than if the universe was created by Ra vomiting or masturbation Tuna or a fart Patah If they do not return to Thelema in its real sense, are doomed to sink and collapse the flow of this esoteric joke that both advocate.Everything that has a beginning has an end of course. The \"wave\" is slowly cooling.Overcome the initial amazement, the \"wow! Yippee! \"the festive, it was realized that all people had access, this carnival esoteric, there was an illusion: the stubble that True Initiates allowed to display the profane and defilers. The shaking subsided esoteric. But the inertia of this movement still makes the corpse shudder, and we still have many years ahead to support the stench emanating from him. Actually, \"occult revolution\" has profoundly affected not only the traditional circles but also the most popular. And most importantly, profoundly changed the methods of transmission of knowledge, which now is more veiled than ever, the fault of this change and the various costumes and idiocies disclosed. In short, the so-called \"occult revolution\" proved a sham, a farce.Unfortunately several orders were involved in this chaotic picture. Including the OTOwhich had its public presentation and structure changed significantly, but not in the right direction, or as it should be. Today it appears in the eyes of the most astute, as a simple \"club\" Masonic, where dilettantes of esotericism, fleeting lovers of knowledge, not students of esotericism, gather to shoot the breeze, to show how they are peacocks - one something totally unholy, without any sense initiation in the true sense of the term. Its links with the Great Order were broken. She lost contact with the Word of the Aeon and the Apostolic Succession. \"Let him who has ears hear.\"Present the origins, history and the protagonists of the movement of the Thelemic Orders in Brazil became a difficult, exhausting, perhaps involving a complexity beyond our discursive capacity, without quoting the great reaction contrary to its completion; reaction is directed by vested interests, is unclear. In addition, there are \"historians\" who, for personal reasons and groups, conjure the truth so that she would never be known clearly and openly. Also, try to do the best we can in the true sense.At first we have to finish, once and for all, with the fables and gossip about Thelema. No one can deny that the process to finish with all this miscellany is already, in itself, an odyssey. Here are involved personal interests and groups. No one is unaware of the fact that people (very malicious) state categorically, but mistakenly (because the facts do not support the version) that Thelema was born in Brazil where, in 1995, came to our country a delegation stemmed from one of several organizations, under the name OTO , to start some individuals the First Three Degrees. There is nothing more wrong, more absurd, as we shall see in the course of this work.Show, supported by documentary evidence, that the Thelemic system began in Brazil for exactly thirty-eight and through the works of Marcelo Ramos Motta. The fundamentals of this statement have been aired in several monographs and letters, each highlighting specific face of the issue.In fact, until 1962, Thelema, Aleister Crowley, OTO , Thelema and the Order of A. '. A.'., subjects were unknown in our esoteric means. Unless some very few scholars with access to books written in other countries (mostly in English), and one or two more serious occult organizations, had the idea that these names represented in the context of modern occultism. It is also a known fact that these organizations and these people carefully hide this knowledge from the public. Even some members (for lower grades) these organizations knew nothing of Thelema, etc.. Because his superiors feared being seen as having any links with Aleister Crowley, whose reputation, social media and religious, was the worst possible although, as we know, such a reputation is the result of smear campaign organized and well prepared for the churches and crististas orders against the man.Readers understand that there would be \"fine\" for the \"status\" of these people be recognized as maintaining links with Thelema and Crowley - that according to the Church of Rome and the Chain Osirianas, a Satanist would be the worst kind. Confusion, historical indeterminacy, the political infighting and those between rival factions, divisions, and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the various gaps and anomalies in the existing biographies of the leaders of the organizations profile Masonic ills are constantly observed by serious researchers. The OTO does not escape this rule, unfortunately.With unvarying constancy, we see people chasing away with that fact, and how can this happen. ie: how can there be so much disagreement between orders or fraternities initiation is saying, and individuals are telling fans to the highest degree. 's incomprehensible to many (but not started) how these things can happen in organizations allegedly created and maintained by the \"Masters \"that is, beings that are believed to have reached levels of consciousness, spirituality, knowledge and wisdom far beyond the ordinary, and that obviously should be inoculated against the weaknesses of the profane world. And we can not say those concerns are unjustified, we have seen highly shocking and reprehensible things happen between these \"Masters\" and their followers. The problem is observed so often that it seems an integral part in the contexts of these organizations and their founders.To explain these anomalies could develop three hypotheses, namely: that these orders are fake and never had any links connecting them to any genuine initiatory currents, or those who are not fans formed anything, much less real started, or there , well veiled, some unknown factor entered here, working to destroy, disrupt or test these institutions, by manipulating discords, divisions and infighting. From this angle, the latter would be, especially for us, the closest to the truth, though not entirely discard the other two remaining. Why spiritual masters allow such things to happen? The question is not easily answered. Perhaps the answer is that they can not directly interfere in the actions of individuals, or who have no power to do so, or are testing the moral and spiritual integrity of these organizations. Maybe, who knows, may need to let \"it go.\" People and groups need to exercise free will, in order to assess the real value them and their requests before the profane world, or attacks of opposing forces.Of course, there are several other versions explaining the phenomenon. Moreover, it would be very important that readers understand that orders are formed, estruturalizadas, \"directed\" and mainly administered in the material plane, for individuals (men and women like us) possess a remarkable diversity of opinions on various topics, and quite flawed in thoughts and actions, as we all. And this happens even among key members of the same organization. As an example of these differences between leaders, members, etc.., See the story of the Golden Dawn. However it was to be assumed that at least the basics, there was a common agreement among these men and women.Unfortunately this is what happens, what for many becomes a paradox unexplained. And it is not easy to talk about a subject as complex as this, requiring years of study and personal experience.The history, development and current conditions of the orders Thelemic themes are extremely confused. This confusion comes from long dates. She raged, over the years, other countries, and ours, in a way beyond any control. Particularly in Brazil, all this amaranhado dark, sum up events to date have not adequately explained or clarified, spiteful and maliciously misrepresented by individuals whose purpose is to increase the existing confusion; individuals without a minimum of ethics, personal manliness and loyalty - true profiteers of holy things for their own benefit. In this context we highlight the events in Brazil between 1962 and 1975 and those arising between 1976 and 1987. In subsequent years, with the emergence of numerous groups flying as genuine Thelemic increased substantially over this web disorderly arise where more political intrigue, moral bribes, encroachments, fights by copyright dubious influence of current policy, and the most inconceivable accusations between \"brothers\". In short: so far no one can, with due conviction, to say what really happened, or is happening within the Thelemic Orders, whether in Brazil or abroad, unless it has been directly and personally involved in the evolution of all occurrences since 1962, when Marcelo Ramos Motta, publishing \"Calling The Children of the Sun\" began the Thelemic Genuinely Movement in Brazil.This is working without any fair claim to be the one to inform not correct and independently. This means you do not have ties to any organizations Thelemic publicly known. Being more explicit: The author of \"The Order and the Oath\" is not present, although it was in the past tense, connected, even remotely, to any organization, external, or say that it has the Thelemic, especially those appearing under names as OTOor A. '. A.' .. Strongly refute any assertion to the contrary.During the course of many years, when we were actively within the context of 'Thelemic organizations', we observe that there is a paranoid tendency to always bind any movement Thelemic pure of these above mentioned structures. This is a gross error, primary - mediocrity committed by those who little or nothing known about Thelema and airy as a new philosophy of life. Understand that any individual (man or woman) can embrace Thelema as life purpose, without belonging, join or submit to structures or hierarchies of any organization, style if she OTO , A. '. A. '. or any other name that is in the universe, so"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"called, orders or esoteric fraternities: \"Every man and every woman is a star.\"The visa today is that, for various reasons, many people have lost confidence in these organizations, as they have been politically manipulated and adapted in favor of certain groups, in which most members directs his intentions in obtaining personal power about their peers, a clear demonstration contrary to the provisions in Liber AL and Liber OZ, the two Columns Master of Building Thelemic, which clearly free people of any bonds, whether political, social or religious. Believe me meet some explaining as the topic discussed here, which content may perhaps surprise most readers, because of certain statements made and the frankness with which a theme, always veiled to the public (only discussed in circles of \"high initiates\") is open and exposed here clearly.Nothing will be revealed, or hidden, for or against this or that group presenting itself as a Thelemic Order This is the basic policy of the whole work. Generally speak without individualize one or other branch, which was divided and subdivided the original system.\"Confused, very confused\"-expressed himself was once a student on the history and current situation of the OTO . I maybe wear a more rude, but I think it is not necessary.People arguciosas, and common sense, knows what, and on that one student referred.However, there are others that, for pure indulgence, or moral weakness, or any other personal reasons, do not want to \"see\" the course, and continue trying to cover the sun with a sieve, or adopting the attitude of the ostrich: \"The I do not see does not exist \", sticking his head in the sand not to see the approaching danger. Really, there is no more comfortable position than this (from the point of aims of the ostrich, of course) but it is very dangerous, both for the individual and for the community. Why, I wonder, that Fiat came to such a critical situation ? However, in hindsight, I realize that it has always been so. I find no time since the creation of the order, where her unit was not at the mercy of frictions and contradictions of his \"numerous leaders\" or other members.Indeed, the breakdown of organic unity in opposing factions always proved a constant, despite many people judge that, in the early years, soon after the creation of the Order, this menacing shadow does not exist. Grand illusion. Just a quick read in various books and documents in order to verify this illusion. Which could attribute the cause of this puzzling situation? For that unity among brothers and sisters must always succumb to the \"monster ego\" when all paths, genuinely Templar, points in the construction and fortification of a union and fraternity unshakable, achieved through the destruction of egos in a constant internal struggle. But is this true?Is it true that the brothers and sisters dedicate themselves seriously to the destruction of the ego in favor of Universal Brotherhood?Well, it may be that this is true for Thelemites, but will be for the pseudo members ofOTO , or A. '. A.'.? I think the answer is no. And I think there be a cause of the issue.Let's see, with redoubled attention, if I am correct in that thought. He may be a bit hazy due to some reason that escapes my consciousness. After all I am a human being like any other, prone to errors of judgment. Nobody is unaware that the OTO came long before Thelema be offered to the world.What does this mean?Among other things means that the Order was born under the sign of the Aeon and thus deeply embedded by egregore the Dying God: bound to last for a short time, since all its original structure (rituals, philosophy, direction, beliefs, etc..) could not survive in the future (ie, in our present) unless being fueled by vampire predation and, as with the Church of Rome.Crowley, it's true, after taking English branch of the Order, tried to change that by adapting the old rituals to the New Reality Cosmic. However, this laudable attempt had no effect. Was not sufficiently radical and profound: the rituals were reviewed but without much change. And the result of the use of these rituals in the last seventy years has been catastrophic. Came an order undisciplined, divided against itself, fraught with confusion and anarchy. Some black spots remained stubbornly stuck in new guise, as everyone can realize not only the lower grades, as well as the superior, especially in the discourse of the ninth grade, where we find clear references to \"our Lord Jesus Christ.\" The attempt was the same as putting new wine into old wineskins. Unfortunately, Crowley, as a human being, was also involved by the vibrations of the Old Aeon.There's also remember that he was born long before the year 1904, when osirianas vibrations were still in full force. Only children born after 1904 who is awakened to life under the influence of vibrations of Horus, \"the avenger of Osiris.\" Then we can observe that leaders and members of the original order, all of them, without any exceptions, were deeply mesmerized by the egregore \"Dying on the Cross\", and rarely would"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"free himself of involvement until their physical death. This is so true that the very Theodor Reuss (the second leading global order) repudiated Thelema in all its nuances and, consequently, withdrew from Crowley and Branch led by him. Herein followed him numerous Germanic Shops and whiskers.It is said with great emphasis on the supposed resignation of Theodor Reuss to the position of leader of the order in favor of Aleister Crowley. This is a 'story' untrue, never happened, and another legend about Crowley, Theodor Reuss OTO etc. aiming fantasize and hide the real facts. To confirm this, we have the statement that Crowley himself in his magical diary 1921: \"I have proclaimed myself OHO.\" And, in a letter to Heinrich Tränker (1924), Reuss admits that at any time there had been chosen as the successor in order. Notice that all the precepts of the order were (and some still are) obviously Osirian, elitist, sexist, etc..The order, as originally conceived, belonged to an era in which the precepts crististas prevailed. The patriarchal character has become clear when we consider that the central secret of the order (the making of the elixir, so to speak) refers only to men (male). It is impossible for a woman 'manufacture' and take the elixir without the help of man. But man can 'manufacture' and take the elixir without the help of women. And I tell you: no woman can reach the IX and XI degrees, unless pro forma. While the age and vigor of man present obstacle to his work in ninth grade he can carry it without problems. Now the woman it does not work well. After menopause is set aside.The order is fraught with elitism German nineteenth century. Those who conceived, or that she joined in subsequent years could - and believe it - people be well intentioned, but they were unconsciously under the direct influence of elitism. Were so absorbed in the atmosphere of the time that even remotely perceived this condition. Examine the titles belonging to various degrees, especially those higher. Look at the photographs of the illustrious founders and subsequent leaders of the order. What do we see? Men in poses bombastic, pompous, covered by loud ridiculous, displaying authority over the 'lower world' (the uninitiated). There seem to men but statues supported by pedestals egoic vanity.It is said by Alex Constantine (The OTO & CIA - Ordis Templis Intelligentis): \"The OTOwas founded in 1895 and 1900 by a pair of powerful mation, Karl Kellner and Theodor Reuss. Politically the order identified with the extreme right, proposing the creation of a pan-Germanic world (the old principle of superior race, destined to hold the reins of the world) based on pagan spiritual beliefs. Kellner died in 1905, and Reuss, a former spy for the Prussian Secret Service, assumed the role of leader. When residing in London, Reuss spied socialist exiles, among these the daughter of Karl Max In 1912 he contacted Aleister Crowley, pointing the head of the British Chapter OTO But the political loyalty of the Beast has always been an open question. \"The work of Mr. Alex Constantine, containing some errors and exaggerations, our attention because it shows how the order is involved in politics, always keeping its main offices in men who, in one way or another, have been, or are, involved in espionage, including Crowley himself, as is said in the work of Mr. Alex Constantine.And speaking of politics, can not in any way refrain from criticizing the policy of a certain branch of the order, when I see the economy of my country fade a spillway endless, and its people increasingly becoming impoverished, while the antiquated members this branch, which is said Brazilian (though their leader is not) lose precious time and energy discussing topics that create anything concrete solutions to minimize the situation. Reply: \"This is not our problem\" (because that seems to be given in Liber AL, III Cap 18 Vs.), Is to want to shirk the responsibility that we all Brazilian nationals, have with our country, and especially with the future generations, to whom we are obliged to deliver it free and rich.Learn that the evolution of a country, especially in its spiritual part (the other is by extension) is in direct proportion to their spiritual evolution started. The more developed and strong, spiritually speaking, these are started, more spiritual and stronger this country - the faster evolution. Attention to what I'm saying: spiritualized a country, a country aligned with the Universe, does not mean that this country is militarily powerful.No! Brute force, firepower is not to mean Spiritual Power, Spiritual Evolution, etc..It is understood that, please.Order or any science can be popularized as it remains tied to any kind of elitism. And, interestingly, this elitism is broken if the order disappears, and, therefore, we are faced with a major dilemma: either to order or serve serve our people. The ideal would be to serve the people through the order. The stronger the order stronger people. But this is an unattainable chimera as humanity, \"in toto\", does not reach the fullness of Spiritual Knowledge and Wisdom. Of course, if all of us (humanity) are one only as an isolated group would be happy to achieve the fullness of wisdom, while others are still in the low levels of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"ignorance?Particularly, if the universe made us Brazilians is because our responsibility is to work on this, and for that, the country, which consists of its people.
