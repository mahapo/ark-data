The accumulation of responsibility andnatural pressure that an Initiate receives on his person, brokethat change.The process of the bizarre transformation and growing every day,approximately in 1980, became a bitter man,irascible and highly rude.Many of his disciples withdrew from active involvementwith it, others retreated into silence * 2, while otherspersisted in the vain hope of a change of the frame.

A movement in phasegestation. An embryo that would grow, creating the necessaryconditions for the system presents Thelemic is aso pure and undistorted, as unfortunately came to passto the detriment of all.  InterregnumIn 1976, Marcelo Motta in Brazil published its \"DOS EQUIONÒCIOGODS \", Vol I N.1. In\" Final Note \"of that book (p.154),appears an information about Euclydes Lacerda de Almeida(Document on file with SNAe). Thus began thetribulations of him until today. And no voice rose in hisdefense. Never, at any time, Marcelo Motta and his followersgave him the sacred right of defense against the charges therewritten.Now, 11 years on, is the moment of response.Became general belief that Euclydes was expelled from the OTO, ieBranch created by Marcelo Motta.However, to the surprise of many in the \"Final Score\" inserted in \"TheEquinox of the Gods \"was never written the word expelled, butyes suspended. And later it is said that \"before the suspension,Euclydes, obsessed ego resigned from the Order \"(which order?).We challenge anyone to publicly show proofthis resignation, is the OTO, is the A ∴ A ∴ , or"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"is the same SNAe. - Simply because there was no such requestresignation. And never existed.Though not a scholar and connoisseur of the languagePortuguese way to know that the suspension is not evenexpulsion.

For this reason Marcelo himself says, in his letter,quoted above, which Euclydes be 'banned' OTO for fiveyears.For expulsion understands the compulsory removal and finalno chance of return, caused by serious crime. On the other hand,resign, translates an act of free and spontaneous will.Qualify this act as evidence of egoic obsession is, accordingthink, go too far on a superficial analysispsychological and even magical - especially when there was no suchrequest. In any case, the less the text Euclydesever been disbarred, but suspended.

The most glaring one being induced in the text, theexistence of an OTO trained and working inBrazil. Marcelo Motta induces this untruth readers. The truthand another: At the time (1975), there was no running OTOin Brazil, even the supposed Branch subsequently created byMarcelo, much less one that would appear much later under the nameof SOTO - acronym by which the \"SEA organization ana\" becameknown after the events developed in the UnitedAmerica (Californian court).

When youseemed, Marcelo, had fallen under the control of someone other malignantmaybe, who knows, by Samael (The False Accuser), the Qlipha Hod,or Ogiel (Arbitrariness) the Qlipha Chokmah.All the news that came to him about his Instructorwere of the same tenor. This policy incomprehensible Store Nuitdrove away in general interested in Thelema and OTOparticular, rather than attract them.Later found an interesting fact: without any exceptionsall those who linked to Marcelo, occupied the post of MasterShop, were execrated and expelled the \"order\" the samereasons, starting with Frater Kephra, founder and financier ofShop Nuit. Frater Saladin likewise been diedisgust shortly after his expulsion. Frater Pound alsoexpelled under the basest accusations. And so on.

PART ONE The Meeting with Thelema  Marcelo Ramos MottaO n August 26, 1987, died in the city of Teresopolis, Stateof Rio de Janeiro, the 53-year-old Marcelo Ramos Motta, moreknown as Frater Parzival XI. His death was 1 *\"Celebrated\" by disciples, and the disciples former enemies .... eachtheir way.Who was Marcelo Ramos Motta? Why this man has become socontroversial in the circles of the occult world in general and the worldThelemic in particular? Why was it so talked about, hated, lovedand, above all, feared?We will try to answer these questions in the most impartialpossible view. But be warned the reader that nothing is sodifficult as this man speak, let alone say theirattainments mystical, magical and your goals ..Marcelo Motta was born on June 27, 1931, in the City of Rio deJanuary.His interest in the occult began early. At 11 years old alreadystudied the books of Eliphas Levi, Papus, Blavatsky, EdwardBulwer-Lynton, Patanjali, Paracelsus and the works of Arnold Krumm-Heller, who nourished by great admiration. Therefore, theirattention would turn constantly to the mysterious\"Rosicrucians\", in which dedicated pesquiza deeply.Later, he contacted the books of Max Heindel, RSClymer and eventually with the organization called AMORC inrelation to which, by the way, has developed trueaversion * 2.Cherished the hope of being admitted to an initiatory school inmolds that described by Arnold Krumm-Heller in the novel \"ROSA-CROSS \", and Bulwer-Lynton on\" ZANONI. \"Whiledeveloped marked aversion to Roman Catholic Christianity, whichhe defined as \"the personification of the denial of the willto live, \"because when Marcelo Motta saw the real meaning"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Roman Christianity in the world, the spirit of the \"anti-christ\"manifested itself with surprising strength in the course of his lifeand work * 3.

And in search of this knowledge \"hidden\" byBehind the Occult, became a focus of willpoweralmost superhuman. Day by day, during his youth, MarceloMotta, had concentrated all of his energy, intelligence and powermeditation in search of this knowledge \"Rosicrucian\". Demandled to the highest degrees of the Great Order.Joining the Military School of Rio de Janeiro * 4, developedhis intellect, discipline and acquired a great love for Brazil.By this time showed great interest in astrology, and Tarotrelated matters. Therefore the focus of many discussions betweentheir schoolmates and teachers. His discussions with theProfessor of Philosophy, MH, been discussed for several yearsamong the students of CMAn increasing myopia prevented their entry into schoolAeronautics. This made him give up the military career, even inother weapons, which caused him great grief. * 5 At thirteenage devoted himself spontaneously to the Service of Humanity. By theThroughout his life we must consider that the vote was acceptedby the Lords of Karma.Completing 17 years of age, he knew, through his mother,FRA existence of a high level Masonic Order founded byArnold Krumm-Heller.It began in the FRA on August 19, 1948. * 6After attending the FRA for some time, and quickly climb thethree degrees of the Order, Marcelo, moved away from the work in store. Toturned 20 years old, his family grew frictionfrighteningly * 7. He struggled against the domination of his mother, whoopposed his will violently. Reaching a pointexcruciating, decided to leave Brazil going to Europe and from thereto the United States of America (1952), where its endEnglish studies at a college north American.On this trip had with him, at the request of the Commander of the FRABrazilian mission to mediate between this and PARZIVAL KRUMM-HELLER (son of Arnold Krumm-Heller), the legal substituteKrumm-Heller died in FRA. * 8In Europe (Portugal), he first learnsThelema through the book 'THE GREAT BEAST, \"a partial biographywritten by Aleister Crowley J.Symonds. Remember, then, thatin the First Degree of the FRA \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole ofLaw \"was part of the Initiation Ritual. This much intrigue,because the FRA had never heard of Crowley or even the MasterTHERION. But while reading the book, raises doubtsas the conditions of initiation Crowley, the firs sight,had seemed to be a Satanist of the worst kind."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Finding himself with Parzival Krumm Heller, following his missionFRA Brazilian ambassador, asks about such AleisterCrowley.

At that time, Marcelo Motta, even knew whatmean OTO.For better understanding of the reader on the subject, opened herea bracket for quick explanation:(According to the version of the FRA Brazilian leader, Dr. Krumm-Heller, before he died, tried to unite the FRA and ROSICRUCIANFRATERNITY IN AMERICA \"9 *, whose leader was then RSClymer.

This considered the letter of Parzival Krumm-Hellertoo authoritarian and peremptory. This was evident with thebreak between Parzival Krumm-Heller and Commander of the FRABrazil.)Now we observe the facts \"by far\" we see as \"the hand ofdestiny, \"or that of\" the Secret \", weave pathways leadingthe student to meet their real aspirations.

It was at this time that Clymer tried thenDr. Arnold Krumm-Heller with that endlessly appetizing bait forprofane and started to lower grades: the idea of unificationall initiatic orders under one powerful and in-orderfazeja. Unfortunately, Arnold Krumm-Heller had fallen into deception. Byie, the leader of the FRA in Brazil received instructions to connect toClymer. At this time Parzival Krumm-Heller was in Egypt,conducting researches on certain personal magic formulas.Not much later, the very Arnoldo Krumm-Heller admitted thatClymer's purposes were not what he thought. * 10Krumm-Heller was Parzival who formed the link between Marcelo Motta andKarl Germer (Frater Saturnus), then OHO of OTO, andThe successor to Crowley in ∴ A ∴ * 11In the United States, contacted Karl Germer, becomingthis disciple.

Eventually, also tried to establish a shopOTO in Brazilian lands. Unfortunately for all of us, notsucceeded in the latter aim - many obstacles arose andMarcelo, even though he fought them all, justdied without getting it permanently. Through their mdisciples came to know that he predicted his own death,whining that he needed to live a further three yearsto accomplish its purpose.As a legitimate member of A ∴ A ∴ , Marcelo Motta (Frater E.) trainedseveral students, both in Brazil and in the USA. Such aFrater A. was among them until the year 1975, being whatmore came close to Marcelo Motta.As stated previously, it is not easy to write about the life ofMarcelo Motta, especially with regard to your careerinitiation and the period from 1975 to 1987, the year thatdied. Marcelo Motta became frighteningly apersonality contradictory and difficult to live with.But a crisa is right - and no one can dispute - he spenttheir entire existence in a fervent struggle toward the Great Work;in search of the most perfect and disclosure of Thelemaestablishment of an order, society or fraternity (notWhatever name) based in the purest sense Thelemic, althoughyour enemies, and others who strongly criticize this effort, thedo out of spite or fear their words inflamedattacking the mistake that they are stuck.However, over the years, we, the recentOccult events involving Thelema in general and in particularas he was right in his insightful pronouncements.We are not defending Marcelo Motta in his moments ofimbalance or the paranoid outbursts of his personality,may already undermined by grief or some disease indevelopment, but in their teachings and their examples"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"personal.

As always, we must remember, \"quantity does not translatequality \"and not a sign of evolution. Take again the ChurchRoman and Freemasonry Osirian as examples.Throughout this struggle, Marcelo Motta, became, for many,a symbol of integrity thelemic, consistent with the dictatesLiber AL vel Legis and Liber OZ.Revered by many, hated by so many and feared by almostmost, his figure became a legend in Brazil and in otherparts of the world. But if we pay proper attention in your life,we see proof that you can live up itegralmente Thelema,Defend Tradition and Authority System, and not surrendercowardly to sophistry and the malicious and sinister and\"Advantageous\" offers the Black Lodge.Marcelo Motta was undoubtedly one of the greatest bulwarks of Thelemain our time. Whatever their mistakes, they do notovershadow his devotion to work. But precisely because he had been aReal Started can not, in good conscience, want to know thetrue motives lurking behind his actions.Especially regarding their position in the ∴ A ∴ , to which theunderstanding hides a work such as Aleister Crowley demandedbroad and comprehensive awareness of the context in which this workis inserted.Of course, we must keep our sense of perspective, and avoidthe excesses to which the human personality is prone. Buteven so, how could we simple beginners degrees morelow, evaluate the entire picture covering such serious issues.Nor should we allow our personal opinions orsentimental (friendship, dislikes, love or hate) interfere withour judgments.The writings of Marcelo Motta, or the same observations, theThelemic various manuscripts, impress with logical rigor andthe strength that only an expert on the subject couldhave, although some of his interpretations can bedebatable. But what struck us as close initiatory degreethat of Marcelo Motta, who would give us validity in this discussion.We only see the outside of things and have very littlepenetration on the inside, and we did not observe the overall picture.Therefore, we should stop criticizing him and use our timeto improve our internal vision. This, in occult language,to say: \"Become a Real Started\".We could say more, but do not believe it is necessary. In fact,it was necessary to say more would be useless.Euclydes Lacerda de Almeida was one of only three to acquire thebook \"CALLING THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN\" withdrawn from circulation a fewdays after its distribution in bookstores in Rio de Janeiro. TheMarcelo Motta himself tells us why the book was"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"removed: \"... is a book that I even condemned as ......inappropriate, and my evaluations of manliness contained therein areimperfect and foolish \"(See that only a man with tremendousself-criticism and a great sense of loyalty to the principlesThelemic would do such a thing). That was until Marcelo Motta1972.We never met the other two book buyers. Many yearslater, a volume was found in a \"fat\" at the RiverJanuary, and acquired by a Sister of OT.O. North American. Theanother volume never appeared.Little is known of the childhood of Marcelo Motta. But we can say that,Born into a family of Germanic origins, had a rigideducation. And that education was enhanced at the Military School of RioJanuary. It was exactly these characteristics (size uprightthe military, German appearance, speaking English with a German accent -her first English teacher was a German Jewish refugeein Brazil) that made Mrs. Germer (another IsraeliI had seen up close the horrors of Nazi Germany) desired volve upgreat dislike for the young student Germer. This antipathyinterfirir would in future decisions regarding Mrs. GermerMarcelo Motta.When Euclydes Lacerda de Almeida met Marcelo Motta, thislived in a small room in the existing pension Tijuca, butnever issued any kind of lament the fact.Later, when he got a job, moved toCopacabana Rua Santa Clara. It was in this small apartmentEuclydes came to know Claudia Cannuto, also known asSoror KAClaudia, formerly a \"student\" of Marcelo Motta, becameone Probationer under the tutelage of Euclydes by imposition ofMarcelo Motta own. More or less the same time EuclydesLacerda received two Probationers coming from Marcelo Motta:Paulo Coelho and Raul Seixas.At this time, Marcelo Motta, showed up a gentle man, retractedand spoke little of his private life. He spent largefinancial difficulties arising from the inconsistency of maintaining along in any job. Fought defined typepersecution caused by their convictions Thelemic.By the very nature retracted Marcelo Motta little we know ofhis private life. But at times he let outsomething, and so we learned some facts, but veryThere was a large surface barrier between Marcelo Motta andtheir closest relatives (father, mother and sister). After returning toBrazil, Marcelo Motta, moved away from any contact with theirfamily. Perhaps this barrier has been erected as a resultthe ideas of the young man. During the entire time that we live, itvery few times touched on the subject. Only in \"The CallingChildren of the Sun \"it touches on family relationships. Never spokeof his youth, his amorous adventures, or any other typeents to relate.Marcelo was in a great sense of responsibilityconcerning his career initiation and proper disclosureThelema, and it would not give up under any circumstances. To him his"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"development and dissemination of Thelema initiation was aboveanything. This uncompromising attitude, we presume, was toFew becoming an obsession, his psychological problemsbecome more acute, turning his aggressive personalityand intolerable.Perhaps this intransigent personality has been motivated bya great approach with that Germer, according to his ownwords of Marcelo Motta, was a difficult man to deal inany type of relationship. Marcelo Motta was entirelyThelema and devoted to his master, in this exact order.In its final return of the United States of America, MarceloMotta began the dissemination of Thelema in Brazil. At this timevirtually no one, not even the most 'occult'knew the system and, of course, much less the A ∴ A ∴ , the OTO,Aleister Crowley and, even less, the Order of Thelema * 14. Itsfirst step in this direction was the publication of \"THE CALLINGCHILDREN OF THE SUN. \"But as it already, this little book remainedbriefly in bookstores. The result was that the SistemThelemic stood still for some time, unknown.Was restricted to a very small circle.It was only after 1964 that virtually Thelema, grewpublicly. However, his publicist - just becausetheir ideas libertátrias - became a person under surveillance,along with those with whom he had contact * 15.Marcelo Motta was repeatedly approached by agents of the ServiceNational Information. And Euclydes was virtually banned from RioJanuary by \"interests\" of the state-owned company thatworked. ------1 Marcelo Motta died at 53 years old, and his death occurred in circumstances somewhat \"mysterious\". The certificate death records, the cause of death, stroke and \"disease.\" But what disease? Here, nothing is said about it. His funeral was arranged by a woman (we think it must have been Claudia Canutto), but whose name does not appear in police files. No one else attended the burial. Contrary to the desire the deceased, the body was cremated.2 Initiates know, of course, the reasons for this aversion.3 Marcelo Motta repudiated Christ Roman Catholic, but not the Cosmic Christ.4 Do we remember the period. When we ourselves become students of that College (1950), Marcelo had finished the Course Scientific.5 In his time Military College, Marcelo Motta, outside speaker College official and very popular among his peers. All the admired for his candor even before his superiors hierarchical.During 6 years, our biography tried to contact"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" a member of the famous \"Rosicrucian\". And as paradoxical or ironic as it may seem, came from his mother (one devoted Roman Catholic) the \"link\" between him and order that aspired belong. He says in \"CALLING THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN\" PAG. 80: \"At seventeen years of age, through my mother (irony for the profane - wisdom to the initiate), found that there an order Rosicrucian linked to Dr. Krumm-Heller.7 His \"family\" did not accept his thoughts \"heretics\".8 Details of this mission, and how it was made, can be studied in \"CALLING THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN\".9 The Rosicrucian Fraternity in America, originally an order of high degree Freemason, was founded, so it is said, by Paschal Beverly Randolph. Randolph (1815-1875) was the son of a wealthy American and a black woman. And it had a childhood terribly troubled. At the ripe age, he decided to travel by world. In Paris, he met Eliphas Levi has influenced notoriously the thoughts of Randolph. In 1840, Randolph joined the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, a group Lutheran-Rosicrucian who was strongly opposed to Theosophy and Spiritualism. Too soon became one of the leaders of the Order, and in 1868 founded the Fraternity of Eulis, based heavily on study and practice of sexual magic, which placed under heavy veils symbolic. Even his associates had little penetration of subject, and it is very significant that R.Swinburne Clymer, who became head of the organization, removing any form of sexual magic order, claiming that any form of this type magic tended to black magic. It will not be necessary to add that order, thereafter, declined sharply from their position.10 The subject is of most interest to members of the FRA. What we matter is that in this and several other meetings with Parzival Krumm-Heller, Marcelo Motta, had knowledge of existence of the OTO, AA, Thelemic and system and, of course, Crowley. Only now, he could identify the picture that existed in both FRA and had caught the attention, and that turns reproduction in the book \"THE GREAT BEAST\". He was the Master Therion, leading all Thelemic Orders.11 Some time after these events, Parsifal left Germany with his wife and son, disappearing completely as are initiated. Only hear news of him recently.12 Germer died because of a testicular cancer. Second account of Mrs. Germer, the suffering of her husband was horrible.13 At this time, Marcelo Motta, arrived at the gates of Full misery. Spent to the penny in printing \"Liber Aleph \"and\" Calling Flhos From The Sun. \"On one occasion, Marcelo Motta, first complained of his situation.

And this kind of \"political inquisition\" Thelema was not frowned upon, even though the system was fully contrary to Communism.  PART TWO Questions and Answers1.

Xavier meant Marcelo Motta was accumulating its complex and riots for a while until, at some time, for any cause minimal, the volcano burst. Their complex can Chase will be there included, but this,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" judge, developed when Marcelo Motta was pursued in the United States of America, in college. Today know that American politics was quite hostile to foreign (mostly South American). At the time Marcelo Motta studied and worked in that country, this hostilities become obsessive, and the FBI was in charge of giving flow to this hostility. Mr. Hoover, then head of the FBI, one homosexual inrustido, gave vent to his instincts persecuting Jews, Marxists, South Americans and blacks, who considered as hindrances to the \"North American way of life.\" More informed people know very well the truth of these statements. Currently several films relate how these people were persecuted in the country of \"democracy and freedom\". In the specific case of Marcelo, there was a \"hit\" on your apartment and get \"found\" traces of marijuana. Not Needless to say, the guy did not even have a lawyer for your defense. He was arrested and subsequently fired the country. If people think that this can not cause disturbances in the mind of A young, is because they are completely ignorant of how the human mind against such acts of violence \"magic\". The same type of persecution (and quite worse) suffered Karl Germer, if u feel in the country under the Nazi yoke, as in America. Edgar Hoover was a patient reached orgasm when could destroy the life of \"Marxists\". Anyone Intelligent may become aware of the issue by checking the facts happened in the black period for which came to America, called \"Hunting Witches\", shortly after the War World.5.

Marcelo Motta had personal contact with Germer? This contact was purely from Master to disciple, or come to have greater affectivity as a friend?R. Letters from Germer Marcelo, and for this Germer, we can observe that the contact between the two was very beyond the limit of disciple to master. Marcelo motta Germer considered as his real father. But how was Germer a personality quite strong and disciplinarian, there various friction between the two. But overall they were quite united. Incidentally all real disciple will come, sooner or later consider his master as his real father. It is the Master who gives birth to the new man.10. As a student of A ∴ A ∴ and the OTO was like Marcelo Motta? Disciplined, bold, stubborn, relaxed? What was your feature?R. Marcelo Motta was extremely disciplined, especially in respect to Thelema. We can not forget he was a student the Military Academy. Marcelo Motta never any iniciopu meal without saying loud and clear dictates of the law Incidentally thing very \"Thelemite\" ever made at any time. I think until many are too embarrassed to do it. Well, every \"Thelemite\" with their convictions. Even when Marcelo Motta took a simple coffee cake Will he announced. Once, we were Cinema in Carioca. When we leave the cinema the sun was almost hiding behind the mountains of Tijuca. He away, and getting close to one of the columns of the building, performed the appropriate greeting.11. Marcelo was married? If so, had children?R. Marcelo Motta was married in the United States of America. This marriage were born, it seems, two children. Separated from the woman for reasons that do not matter much. Regarding the subject, it is written in \"Calling The Children Of The Sun\", \"My ordeals were becoming deeper; Masters took my Oath of Renunciation to the letter. I lost the love of my wife, I lost my kids who idolized, lost all my material possessions, my reputation, and almost that freedom of my body. \"12.

PART FOUR START OF OTO IN BRAZILHow did the OTO in Brazil? We would not put soquestion. It was not the OTO that arose in Brazil, but the systemThelemic. We should not take sides at all. The emergence ofOTO has become an inevitable consequence.In any case, in 1962 \"appeared\" the first news about theOrder. They came with the publication of \"CALLING THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN\"(Marcelo Ramos Motta - 1962 - Graphic Lux Limited - Rio de Janeiro.).In the words of the author, the publication of this book wasintended to provide the public with news of the SYSTEM THEL-MICO,as disclosed by THERION. Of course, in the text werereferences to AA, OTO and Thelema ORDER, the latter tolittle known today.Euclydes Lacerda de Almeida WAS ONE OF THE FEW BUYERSBOOK, interesting himself immensely by OTO \"CALLING THE CHILDRENSUN \"remained a short time in bookstores. Noticing an error inthe same text (the error was in the tree-SchemeLife presented in the book), Marcelo Motta, withdrew tocirculation. According to your own words as, very fewpeople have acquired. Once Marcelo Motta saidcategorically that these buyers are five in number.Euclydes out of these. We never met the others. Yearslater a volume was found in a \"sebum\" of Rio de Janeiro andacquired by a Sister of the Order. The three remaining volumes everappeared. Today the book is very rare.Euclydes bought the book casually past a bookstoreneighborhood where he lived (Tijuca). At this time struggled betweencrististas prejudices, very strong in so-called, yearsgold, and the most salutary impulses of nature in a manfull physical and mental health. We now understand that allevents in the life of a young man propelled toward Thelema: thebuying \"CALLING THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN\" was not as \"casual\" ashad thought. And future events judgments confirm this.Initially, as always happens with anyone who enters ainitial contact with the Thelemic philosophy, felt doublyattracted and repelled by the contents of the book.

At the time even knewFreemasonry is an Order sidewalk during the Aeon of Osiris. Incidentally, evenknew the meaning of Aeon, was Osiris or Horus. Itsinitiation was disappointing.Every ritual performed entirely on the material plane. Nothing feltin particular, even in the following initiations. In the Third Degree, wasgreatly repelled by the grim and gloomy Middle Chamber.Only much later, when m contact with the Forces of AeonHorus, understood the reason for this reaction. Evidentlyexpected something similar to that described in several booksthere had been read, especially in ADONAI, Jorge Adoun, bothexcite your imagination. His anxiety grew. There was a greathyped clash between the \"spiritual\" and \"occult\"dominated by the so called \"Original Sin\", and its salutarysex drive of a 23 year old. Your questions stillremained hammering his head. Their r esponse not come withtheir \"initiation\" Masonic. Intuitively was led to meditateabout the problem.

That same year (1963) received thevisit Motta.After this first meeting, Marcelo Motta, beganassiduously frequenting the house of Euclydes. It was felt that thisman passed by large financial needs.

Euclydes immediatelychose the OTO (Order of Thelema was then offquestion, for reasons known to Initiates of Gnosis). SoMarcelo, handed him the Lamen of the Order drawn in colors.Euclydes was amazed. Had seen that ramen somewhere.Just do not remember where. Marcelo laughed at the reaction of the youngbut said nothing. Days later, Euclydes, remembered: it was the sameLamen ado by AMORC in the booklet called (wrongly) 777 (ACATHEDRAL OF ALMA). Marveled at the fact, and Marcelo confidedthat AMORC was founded by a former member of the OTO Nextshowed him another Lamen, well known former members ofAMORC, wherein the source or the connection between the two modes, itis evident (documents in the archives of SNAe.). We claim thatwas known, because the former members recentlyleaders of AMORC \"fit to\" withdraw from Lamencirculation. As readers can see, the Lamen was veryconclusive about the strong links with the OTO and AMORC,evidently with Aleister Crowley, the fact that the leaders of AMORCdo anything to hide.In \"Documents Rosicrucians\" (p. 38 - First Edition inPortuguese - 1980) is the copy of the Patent Viio OTOgranted to H.SPENCER LEWIS by THEODOR REUSS. The document alsocontains a declaration of friendship between the two orders,clearly demonstrating that leaders recognized the OTOAMORC, which flatly contradicts the statements of MarceloMotta in \"CALLING THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN\" about the Order of HSLewis.Over time, Marcelo Motta and become Euclydesintimate, and first began broadcasting to the young friendThelemic knowledge orally and voluminous amountsmms. These included the 'LETTER TO MATION \"(manuscript).In early 1964, Marcelo Motta, handed him the translation, forPortuguese, THE BOOK OF THE LAW OF COMMENTS METRE with THERION,informing him of the need to publish it in Brazil, and forthis, the disciple asked for help.

Years later, the book waspublished in English in the U.S. by the Marcelo Motta, using thePublisher Samuel Weiser Inc. (New York - First Edition - Sept. 22ber 1975). Even today we can not understand the resolution ofMarcelo Motta edit important book in another country and in anotherlanguage, whose consequences were pretty dire forBrazilians interested in Thelema.In 1962, Marcelo Motta, succeeded, with great sacrifice (spentall their savings), print \"LIBER ALEPH\" (Printed byGraphic Composition-LUX Ltda Rio de Janeiro.
