Thus, those whose bases esteban in the mythical figures of Jesus Christ, Osiris, Solomon, Hiram and as many icons patriarchal, had in the fertile imagination of man as a supreme example of the human ideal and perfect.The New Aeon, the Aeon of Horus ilamado and is based, in a certain way, in the Circle, Goddess, Mother whose symbol is the Son ou manifestation. So new interpretations from a different point of view spring from understanding the nature of things.Thus, many of the concepts once taken as true, by the light of the progress of investigations, both technological and philosophical ele field due to the \"influence\" of the New Aeon, assume new meanings, more appropriate to the present day .Aspirants to Real Art should be aware that the oldest mysteries-physical and not metaphysical. A version and other esoteric esoteric about it, similar to the written and oral law of the Jews. However, contrary to what is usually assumed a metaphysical version is an exoteric and not vice versa. This can be deduced by elementary student of the seventeenth chapter of the Book of the Dead of Egypt, one of the oldest existing initiatory texts. There, accompanied by the text of the Book, displayed, explained and written according to the tradition, the secret, occult wisdom contained, a veil, referring to the physical origin of the abstract concepts contained in the book. Spiritual issues are explained in physical terms or, more precisamnete, philosophical.And I apologize for those who consider the revelactión impropria the mysteries they judge necessary to maintain elevated covered Veil of Isis, and reiterate the fact that the Mysteries and the True Gnosis are predominantly psycho-sexual nature. We have said that the \"keys\" of occultism prático are connected with magic or mysticism, can be understood by the intecto through study, but it is only on the Inner Planes that is effective disclosure. Except that those \"contacts\" in these planes are proposed intervention in an appropriate manner, any reading will reveal the mysteries shown indecipherable (veiled) purely intellectual analysis.Here I will try to provide some light on these issues. Try also demonstrate some relations between Kabbalah and Masonic system and how it is the precepts of that foundation. The Veil of Paroketh Esoteric Some doors can be opened by careful study and experience of the sacred texts of the religions of the world if, in its place, we use the keys APPROPRIATE.Many of the key system developed in Western esoteric is in the Kabbalah. We were able to verify, based on several years of study and practice in this area, which some important passages of the New Testament have been neglected by most esoteric. But it seems that they were conveniently \"distorted\" by them, for which such keys would be revealed very compromising. One of these distorted keys found in Matthew 25:51: \"It happened that the veil of the temple was torn in parts from top to bottom: the earth trembled rocks broke off.\"I guess it's only natural that, in verse and Matthew, expect some Perguntas:? Velo What is this?Why is ripping at the exact moment that Jesus expires on the cross?? What relationship exists between these two SUCESSOS?Starting from the premise that the Bible, like any holy book, contains initiatory teachings in parables, nothing more natural than the need to be interpreted correctly, so that we get the proper key lessons locked there. There is in the Bible, both the Antoguo and New Testament, several references to the Veil of the Temple, as we shall see in the following examples:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"Take also the veil of blue, purple and crimson and fine linen embroidered\" (Exodus, XXXI, 35)\"Also make a veil of blue, purple and scarlet, and fine linen\" (Chronicles, III, 14).At this point we come to time, in this context, those veils removed by Salome, running the Dance of the Seven Veils (a real \"strip\" ritualistic, much like one another lived for David, to dance naked before the Holy Ark ), to the ecstatic and eager guests of Herod.Attention must also be given as to the price charged by the beautiful dancer a sua stepfather (Herod), ie, the \"Head of John the Baptist\".A time many may think u are right, that there is an identity of the two events, namely between the Veil of the Temple and the Veils of Salome. They view representam the same key in two different ways. With some patience, added tracks offered here, it is clear that this identity will jump to the eyes leading us to the heart of the Arcane.We explained: Seven Veils Salome's dance are the Seven Planes (In the Apocalypse of St. John, are the Seven Seals and the Seven Trombetas) that the Initiate must unpack for a naked, raw truth on his forehead: then he will lose his head, that is: the lower self, your ego, etc (the Masons indicated Signal First Grade).Recalling what has been said above, surprisingly, we observe that in the particular reference to Matthew 27:51, entirely related to the death of Jesus, when we boarded, we received so simplistic interpretations very rarely have the nonsense as, for example, to say that the Veil of the Temple would be torn by Jeohovah enraged by the brutal murder of his son.Indeed, the leading event described by the New Testament refers, in a veiled way, ie hidden, the apex of one of the most important stages of initiation.We know, through the historian Josephus, that the Temple of Jerusalem contained three large divisions and the third one, the most interior where the Holy Ark rested, received the name of the Holy of Holies and was exclusively devoted to Divindad (Jehovah, in the case of the Jews). This third and Secret division was the place where only the High Priest entered once a year, so there, \"behind the veils\", pronouncing the Ineffable Name (IHVH).This chamber was separated from the interior by a Veil, whose name is Paroketh.The entire building of the Temple is based on certain sacred canons, the which, in turn, nothing more obvious to those who follow this Science and penetrate its mysteries, scrounge a rare jewelry and perfume that she always offers that her approach with respect and admiration.Now, so, if in fact there is, based on the Holy Kabbalah, a relationship between the \"rip the veil\" and \"death of Jesus\", and what is the relationship, or rather, what is veiled.According to a well-known scheme of Kabbalah, the Tree of Life is divided into three triads: Superior (Kether, Chokmah and Binah), Central (Chesed, Geburah and Tiphareth) and Triad Inferiorm (Netzach, Hod and Yesod). Derived from the last we have the Kingdom (Malkuth, the area of Earth), the point where, by the initiation process, the man begins his journey of ascent to the higher spheres.Let's see what esse Way:Starting in Malkuth, the First Sphere, or Kingdom, vertically ascendiento found the following sphere, Yesod or Foundation.Then, on Yesod, is Tiphareth, the Beauty, the Third Efera, or Sphere of the Sun, the center and heart of the Tree of Life and also the first major objective of the True Initiation, is to decide, the great spiritual achievement, the result of our meeting with the Higher Self. Thelemites speaking, the Holy Guardian Angel (SAG). The Holy Guardian Angel receives, in other systems are not Thelemites different names such as: Adonai, Christic Center, Augoeoides, Osiris tc. The Holy Guardian Angel is not exactly the Higher Self, but the analogy is valid in the absence of a better. Best would be to say: \"Spark of Divinity Individualized or Hidden God in every man and woman.\"The work of climbing the Tree of Life, when given, following the \"Path of the Arrow\" is constituted by the Paths of Tau and Samech, about 32 º and 25 º (corresponding to the Universe and Art Atus. And between these two paths are laser Sphere of Yesod. Samech The path is \"crossing\" the Path of Phe (27 º - Fulminated Tower) connecting, in turn, Hod (Splendor) and Netzach (Victoria). These trails form a cross for where the Applicant will inevitably towards Tiphareth. In other words, it means that he will be \"crucified\". But not only this \"crucifixion\" that stands between him, which is in Malkuth and Christic Center.Here we also find another clue: \"Path of the Arrow\": an arrow from a bow needs to be released sua"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"towards Diana. , Where it's esse Arc?As stated by Dion Fortune \"Caminho Initiation follows the coils of the Serpent of Wisdom in the tree, but the Caminho of Enlightenment is the Path of the Arrow launched by the Arc of promise, Qesheth, or rainbow astral colors that spreads like a halo behind Yesod \".Note that the word Qesheth (or better, QSTh-tsq) consists of the letters of the Paths 29, 31 and 32 respectively the Trumps of the Moon, The Trial and The Universe.\"What is above is like that which is below\" is an old aphorism. It can be applied at all levels of existence, and consequently, as the Abyss separates the Higher Triad Sephirotic tree the rest of the Spheres, Central Triad of Equilíbrio, is separated from the Lower Triad by a lagoon, known for Kabbalists as Paroketh Veil; cirto that sense, constitue the Abyss own, but in a smaller scale.Entering using the initiation process, towards Tiphareth (or God Within) the Applicant must attain Yesod - the Esera of the Moon, or the Astral world - and go through the intersection (the intersection of the Paths of Phe and Samech), \" ripping \"then Paroketh veil beneath and immediately Tiphareth and Netzach Hod above and enter in this way, in the Holy of Holies, ie the Middle Chamber (of Freemasons) the House of Internal God, very well represented in the Great Pyramid as the King's Chamber.There, the Applicant, now Adept, should pronounce the ineffable name, or name Sacred Guardian Angel, dying in his human and conciencial reborn in another reality.The work inciado consecucción in acetate magical as mystical, using the diagram of the Tree of Life, will gradually ascending to the various planes of consciousness (symbolized by the Spheres) went of the Middle Way (or Middle Pillar) that will lead to the presence of the \"God Within\" (\"Jesus,\" Adonai, Osiris etc.). As this work is done by the Applicant, the Realms of the elements, one by one, are conquered. The opening of \"rip\" the Veil of Paroketh is the last obstacle to the partial destruction of ego mundane. This destruction, a \"sacrifice\" to the Higher Self is the Mystic Death knew as \"Father, into Your arms surrender my soul.\"Malkuth, Yesod, Netzach, Hod and Tiphareth are the five areas: the Pentagram, the four elements ruled, or dominated, by the Spirit. They form the Blazing Star of the Freemasons, or Divine Man symbol. The letter Shin (Spirit) inserted between the Four Letters of the Tetragrammaton (Yod, He, Shin, Vau, He) transforms it into Yeshuah, or Adept. This phenomenon happens all adepts cone reaching Grade Ineffable. We see, then, that the entire pro symbolic drama represented \"life\", \"Ordeal\" and \"death\" of \"Jesus,\" he says only one direction: the Kabbalistic scheme of Spiritual Attainment."}]
