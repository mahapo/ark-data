[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"OPEN LETTER TO FRATER N.Tz (About the A. '. A.'., Motta and other issues) Dear / Guys Frati, Sorores, Brothers, Friends and Enemies: A man can be defamed,ridiculed, imprisoned, tortured and even killed by those who hate him. But, at any time and in any circumstance, your enemies can delete the Flame that shines in your heart. Frater Aster IX ° OTODo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the LawVery reluctantly, and deeply troubled, come out of silence obeying that which, by definition, I call yearning for Justice and Internal Consistency. return to an extremely tedious, in order to reveal certain points still kept hidden for most, although know perfectly that many cover their eyes to catch sight of them. I recognize clearly that in doing so, I am taking the risk of being misunderstood and look in the eyes of many, as a creative person pesters case, etc.., As many have already rated me throughout my life.In the past two years, the study and discussion of Thelema in Brazil, would not be complete without bringing the public certain facts that recently began out of the shadows through extensive documentation arrival at our hands. The analysis of these documents showed us the urgent need to bring them to the attention of all those, entered the Movement Thelemic, crave and need the truth.No matter who gave us the documents, or circumstances that moved him to do so, if for injuries caused by specific, recent events, if by personal frustration or anger. Are details that anything invalidate documents. What is important is the existence and authenticity of them.Want nothing more than to show what is happening and has happened behind the scenes of the Brazilian Movement Thelemic. Do not blame nor we address any of the disciples of N.Tz (author of the document chosen as the first in this series of notes which begin today), we have nothing for or against them. Believe, have been glamorized. We can not therefore blame them. How many of us we would fall into the same mistake? The big problem is that we all want success in our endeavors, and the desire to accomplish this salutary sometimes wish we become blind to many realities. It is precisely for these situations that call for attention.Just two days ago, I received an envelope containing extensive documentation between letters, emails, testimonials, etc.. Among these an interesting e-mail sent by N.Tz (address oto@xxo.com ) answering the various questions raised by Dr. Santos. Of course, N.Tz. bike is a magician, but their identification will be perfectly intuited through its website.The message is developed in four (4) pages, posting comments N.Tz on Marcelo Ramos Motta and Euclydes Lacerda de Almeida. In these comments we find numerous statements which, we suppose, are of general interest. Obviously we reserve the right to comment on them in light of our intimacy with the subject. C'mon, therefore this analysis, In response to one of the questions of Mr. Santos, elucidates N.Tz. \" I can not explain this to your satisfaction, probably. By what authority did AC work? That the A. '. A.'. proper, those of we. Cornichons not Emphasize the persons who carry forward the Order, the present officers prefer anonymity, as is proper.Motta was the only trained and adept confiemed by Germer an officer in the A. '. A.'. - See the imprimatur to Equinox III (6) \"Liber Aleph\". That is Motta's motto. You can not know Mottra's standing re: Germer without reference to Their voluminous correspondence. After Germer's death, Motta effetively held the all the officers he was the only officer alive. Motta treined and very few Individuals Admitted to Zelator or beyond, and those are advanced students I refer to, and - all - of the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"advanced students now work together, without exception. Motta's later students did little or no A. `. A.`. the work he was obsessed with SOTO, this shows in Their output and general lack of character . \" What is explained by N.Tz is that Motta or better Frater A. [1] , was (and still is of course) [ 2] , the only trained and adept Germer confirmed by the A. '. A.'. .And the information goes further, stating that the degree Motta, the Order was located beyond Zelator. And this we deduce the very words of N.Tz., Motta coached by stating that \"few individuals to Zelator degree or beyond. \" So, of course, Motta could only train individuals in that grade or beyond this if he himself was invested with much Degrees above Zelator (a Master of the Temple, perhaps), which confirms what Motta always confided in about her \" status \"in the Great Order, and put that many questions they do not want to accept the facts, because these bother them.In the same paragraph we read the statement that \"After Germer's death, Motta effectively kept all official positions as being the only graduate vivo\" (in A. '. A.'., Of course). Ending paragraph N.Tz. also informs us that \" Motta trained and very few individuals admitted to the Degree of Zelator or beyond, and these are the advanced students to which I refer, and all now work together without exception \"(note the last statement,\" without exception \") .This is not true. There are other students Marcelo Motta (ie, exceptions) that never would connect to, much less would work with N.Tz.; namely: Claudia Cannuto (who resigned and withdrew into silence), William Barden (current leader of the Foundation Parzival XI), William Eales (Leader HOOR - Holy Order of Ra-Hoor-Kuit), and Mr. Ben Stone. The gathered these Frater Pound (Store Nuit), Mr Berson and Euclydes Lacerda de Almeida (OCT) which although not named heirs, were students under the Wand of A. Frater, two of them reached the degree Zelator, and continue to working on the line drawn by the Instructor. Paragraph three N.Tz. expressly says: \" Thus the Order was continued leadership, although the problems of mental Motta caused him a severe fall . \" This is very interesting and important. Proves definitely that Motta kept alive Order and without break in their continuity and at the same time, demonstrates its ability initiatory (Marcelo)Now, regarding the \"drop\", we ask: How can a Master of the Temple fall? For those who know little or nothing about the subject, I must clarify the following: According to the Teachings Thelemic, a Master of the Temple is the Adept who has crossed the Abyss, reached the Sphere of Binah and therefore being beyond these vicissitudes fall, etc.. And that is precisely why it is feared Marcelo Motta. Or better put, they fear Binah, ie a Sephira whose achievement in terms initiation, represents the total annihilation of the ego. But this is a subject too complex to be discussed here (for better clarification see Liber 418). Paragraph 4 found so many interesting, paradoxical and contradictory statements coming from N, Tz.:\" If you are concern about Motta's reference to me as a 'probationer failed', I will tell you in confidence que I cut contact with him ev in June 1976, two months after taking my Oath probationer, due to his publication of \" Commentaries of AL \"See the Short Comment. I Considered him the center of pestilence, and he PROVED himself to be que In the following years. He have done good work in the years leading up to que, que but the publication of his book was spiritual dowfall, in my opinion. I still work my Admitting superior, who was Motta's most advanced student . \" This paragraph deserves observations take longer, because here is clear the \"status\" of N.Tz. the Order, ie no \"status\", we say no to something else. See that we are not making. Are his own words in the email.N.Tz says that Marcelo Motta resigned in June 1976 ev, two months after taking the Oath of Probationer. For further elucidation of what a Probationer follows the following description:\" The Probationer: Signs the Oath of Probationer and choose a name Magic. Their main duty is to start practices which he prefers, persists in them for a year, and write a report of the same careful.One Star in Sight .Notice that the \"rating\" of the Probationer is 0 ° = 0 □. What does this mean? This simply means that the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"degree\" of Probationer is OUT OF TREE ESQAUEMA Calvary. ( See Liber XIII ), and that the degree is not really a degree, but a state of probation, hence their \"rating\". The individual is still on probation (which serves as proof) process that is used to test the integrity of someone. Neglects the fulfillment of which entails removal of the Probationer. See also that N.Tz. cut contact your instructor two months after signing his oath. That is, he did not fulfill even 25% of the time required in the practices of \"degree.\"But anyway, being a simple Probationer, or rather a tentative Probationer, he found himself able to \"judge\" the actions of their Instructor. Which in 1976 was already a Master of the Temple. And because he cut contact with your instructor? \"... due to its publication of \"reviews AL\". He continues: (this) \"I considered him a center of pestilence \"With this N.Tz. mean Motta annexed \"his own comments to Liber AL\". What is not true.Motta ever \"commented Liber AL\", it simply puts the observations Reviews Crowley to clarify some obscure points of the writing of Crowley. And these observations are quite different from comments because characters written in Italics. The main concern of Marcelo Motta, in drafting the observations, was that of helping all those who had, for various reasons, difficult to understand Crowley's comments, as we all know was a prolific writer with literary style quite airtight. These observations were also made to further elucidate untranslatable words from English to Portuguese: passages, names, numbering cabalistic, etc.., Written by Crowley. And, by the way, these observations were, some time ago, praised and welcomed by many of those who now criticize Marcelo Motta by doing them. True human love spit in the dish you ate ...However, if we assume as true the assertions that Motta put their own \"reviews\" along with Crowley, he could never be considered a \"center of pestilence\" for this reason, because he was a Master of the Temple, and as such, accredited to do so. But he DID NOT. It is a blatant lie to say otherwise. This \"legend\" Motta said that Liber AL belongs to an armed plot against him and all his followers, members of the Caliphate, including those who have benefited from these notes. If the reader wants further clarification, please read the Preface and the Introduction of that book. *Later in the email N.Tz., we find this \"wonder\":\" I still work with my Admitting superior, who was Motta's most advanced student . \"Now if N.Tz. cut contact with Motta, why did not the \"more advanced student it?\" This, from the point of view of our common sense and our intelligence (however poor it may be), is a tremendous contradiction. Because \"the most advanced student Motta\" never received N.Tz. as a student after the latter cut its links with Motta. This acceptance would, for \"the most advanced student Motta.\" An act of insubordination hierarchical, unless this \"more advanced student Motta\" also had, himself, severed their links with their Superior in the Order. But this is not said, and N.Tz. this does not identify his \"instructor\". Who is he? James Wasserman? Claudia Cannuto? Euclydes Lacerda? William Barden? Or BStone? However, we have no doubt about that, because it never mentioned any of the last four would accept the post of Instructor N.Tz., a self-fired Probationer of the Order[3] . The first of them, Wasserman, demonstrates perfectly not agree with the opinions of N.Tz., because he himself is the author of the \"Preface\" of \"The Commentaries of AL\", and hence indicating not cultivate any contrary opinion the publication of the book.In paragraph three, N.Tz., belies an entire structure touted by some of the students under the instruction of S., considered by N.Tz. as the current Cancellarius of A. '. A.'.: The \"story\" of \"Bloodlines\", admits that when J. Wolfe never left any well-trained student after his death.Paragraph six onwards N.Tz. covering up under the mantle of the condition of the confidential e-mail, weaves little comments polite (to say the least) about Euclydes Lacerda, one of Frater OTO and A. '. A.' .. Do not know how N.Tz. was misinformed about this Frater, yet he did not act within the Holy Thelemic concepts, when discussing an Frater using a confidential message, that is, by talking back. The least one would expect of an Initiate both in OTO as in A. '. A.'., Is that it would send a copy of the message to Frater whose name was mentioned there. Hiding under a confidential letter would not be the attitude of Marcelo Motta, or any other Real Brother of the Order. There is a posture, among others, fundamental Thelema: Never talk about someone (good or bad) without that someone is present.No comment on the rest of the email. It would be a waste of time. We'll let the readers analyze and draw their own conclusions. But referring to paragraph 12, we are driven to a brief comment: \" I sense que you"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"are sincere, and you have been served by Euclydes, who let the Order down by letting you dawn . \" First Euclydes never served poorly, or misled Mr. Santos, simply because Mr. Santos never was a student under his instruction, but under the instruction of another Frater. This is the truth. And the proof of this is that the Oath of Probationer Mr. Santos is directed to another Frater, not Frater T.Second Euclydes could never leave the order fall. She never fall, despite the drop anyone. That this concept is inducing think that the fall or stay of a Holy Order or not depends on the fall of its officers or members or materials?In closing, I remind readers that this email was written in 1997, that is, when Mr. Santos was still Master of the Lodge of the Caliphate in Brazil (North American OTO) under the authority of N.Tz. or \"other\" and therefore still considered \"useful and manageable.\"Since man has acquired certainty by spiritual intuition, can never fall victim to the uncertainty, although slight clouds sometimes can tarnish the shine of this divine consciousness.After such an experience, deserted me last vestige of doubt, the slightest hint of uncertainty that the one who wrote this email is not really a start. There are no bad people, there are sick people12/04/1999 Euclydes Lacerda de AlmeidaLove is the law, love under will [1] - E. Note: We can not fall into the error of confusing the personality, if Marcelo Motta, the \"magical being\" A. This is basic in Magic. Do not confuse this also A. with Aster.[2] - Note E,: Unless deemed as true, the materialist premise stating that death is the end of everything.[3] - E.
