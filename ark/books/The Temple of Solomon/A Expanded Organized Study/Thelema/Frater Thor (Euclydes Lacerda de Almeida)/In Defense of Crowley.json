[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"IN Defense Of Aleister Crowley(The Wizards of Television)A whole series of writers who claim to be \"occult\" undertaken in recent years in our country a barrage of nonsense that have been absorbed by a public eager but unprepared for \"esoteric knowledge\".From 1981 ev, appeared several \"gurus\" and \"wizards\" dedicated principally and almost entirely, to attack the current Thelemic the figure of his greatest promoter, Aleister Crowley.All these people, however, can not ignore demonstrate that Aleister Crowley, despite the hatred that arouses, possesses a profound influence on their lives in particular and contemporary occultism in general as never other occultist obtained. And all these people together - despite the differences between them - by hostility to Thelema, intend to present themselves as true believers. Leaning on a pile of \"doctrines\" supposedly untouchable, detractors of Thelema, go up stupidly declared fideism; and thus unconsciously indicate that \"current\" are actually connected (or rather enslaved). But not satisfied with the avalanche of books (bad) sold to a misinformed public, several of these \"occult\" have emigrated to television where, I suppose their monkeying magic can be enjoyed by a wider audience.Yesterday, 7/19/92 ev I attended a long and sui generis interview one of these \"occult\", the \"Network Headline Televisions\" aired. The patient was one of those goofy. One of the most dangerous, because they learned something magic (enough to glamorize people) in previous contact with our Holy Order. It would not, perhaps, necessary to say that he gave a bunch of bullshit and estultices about magic, rituals, evidence initiatives, etc.. It was just that, I'd be silent. But it happens in your silly points touched on very sacred to us Thelemites, ie, our Holy Order and Our Frater Superior. Moreover insinuouter held the most important Attainment Magico-Mystic that humans can aspire: a meeting with his Holy Guardian Angel, which, he said, \"saw only one arm.\" His narrative of the event, closely resembles that of Mathers, to describe his \"encounter\" with the Secret in 1892.One hundred years later the same bullshit is repeated ...Early in the interview, he was just stating that possession of \"gifts\" make it rain and windy. On other occasions, as I heard one of his closest associates, he \"broke glasses at a distance.\"After all, what kind of \"wizard\" is this it loses so much time with such circus acts? After all what kind of \"brotherhood\" it belongs, to accept as one of their members a Boeotian fan broken glasses? What kind of \"brotherhood\" which is this time its members is lost in learning the art of rainmaking and other ridiculous statements? If we consider the existence of vera \"brotherhood\" and its \"seriousness\" to start, two questions arise: what is serious and what is a fraternity initiation? It is true that every fraternity is the set of its members, in varying degrees or levels. And if all members of this brotherhood are equal to that of television, what to think of this \"brotherhood\"?The only thing really valid in the interview, I must say it was the sight of the interviewer - one of the most beautiful women in the video. No greater magic than that of the vision of a beautiful, intelligent woman? No greater secret than the one that created the woman?Here is the great secret of the universe, the power to create beings almost divine in its form - radiant beauty, whose mysterious glance or a slight smile conveys the deepest secrets of creative power. Like all my brothers and sisters know, I am not much given to critical and rarely get mad.But I can not remain silent when I see a goofy displaying his boundless stupidity with an air of wisdom. Worse when goofy in question was, in times past, one of our members.Truth. With sadness, but fulfilling a moral duty, I must admit that much of the blame in that goofy appearance is up to us, who cheerfully admitted in Our Circle. For a better analysis here some selected topics of the interview, which I thought most important. They serve to illustrate the point of stupidity that can get an individual dominated by the \"devil\" of the ego.But before I understood the following: do not say that the paths indicated by our Holy Order are the only and right. It would be a stupid claim from us stating that we find the only door, when this can be done only the result of the search and the meeting by each individual in his own orbit. Therefore, our Holy Order provides several methods of Spiritual Attainment or Magico-Mystic. The only method is to refute the faith, dogmatism, etc.. We have them replaced by personal experience and practical methodical and constant, as"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Crowley, and several others, advocated in his writings. Therefore we are led to the conclusion that all those who have incensed the god and worshiped through the ages, as \"things\" external to themselves, were never able to prove that faith devoted to them has improved the lot of man and the world. Not infrequently, the faith, giving birth to religious fanaticism, and his history shows this truth, and the crimes that abound there.V In 1982, I wrote an article, which was published in PLANET n.115 (APR). In this article I tried, so brotherly, but incisive, alert to that our former student (the goofy television) errors and mistakes committed by him in his writing \"AURORA CENTURY TWENTY\", also published in an earlier issue of that same magazine. At the time I still find myself under the discipline of Frater Aossic Aiwass, and maintained the illusion of being condescending and silly \"esoteric\" class interviewed. After all, that lord \"wizards\" still seemed to maintain some balance \"magic\" and, therefore, tenuous but possible chance to recover. His references to the Master Therion were respectful and, indirectly, betrayed a certain knowledge and acceptance of the real position of that fan in the modern context magical and mystical. This was my first mistake, did not notice the camouflaged fox snarls Roman. Their hidden nails had been poisoned by hatred distilled in the Black Lodge (not to be confused with Black Fraternity, please) and its ramifications.He had already been tainted by the rot that egregore so well known by all real Initiates and Brothers in Thelema. The courtship between him and the vampire now start when he accepted the position of the Organization henchman who always tried to destroy the true Church. The namorisco to start when he gripped by fear of being dominated by the \"Forces of Evil\", was faced with its first ordeal. This came in the form of political persecution. The ordeal was directed to test it for their dedication to their own \"ideal\" at the time, including politicians and \"magic\", or initiation.He tries to date and blame the Order had chosen for his evolution as a human being.It is necessary to say here that in those years there were many Brazilian political ignominy generated by the military dictatorship. Many were persecuted, tortured, imprisoned, deported and killed. I suffered persecution. But neither I nor thousands of other legitimate patriots, blame the \"Forces of Evil\" (in the theological sense) for it, much less the Great Order. Even assuming that the dictatorship had been generated by the \"Forces of Evil\", we must also say that the Roman Church also supported so that unrestricted Force of EvilNow the goofy calls \"Mago\", should know that such changes in political-historical panorama of a nation are subject to contradictory variations. Proof Air conveys this knowledge as the Air with its continuous fluctuations is the emblem of life. goofy The ever felt the force of Choronzon, and it failed that little test performed in the plane of Malkuth with the emotional repercussions that happen The test was performed at the level of Yesod? It was exactly what followed. Cornered, blurring is fear losing a privileged position in the social context (the context that both fought) forgot that the Spiritual Attainment lies beyond, far beyond mere personal considerations, financial and social. We can achieve Spiritual Attainment even within a prison - Frater Saturnus (former OHO order) is an example of this.He hit the \"Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel\" in a Nazi concentration camp under the most cruel tortures. Frater P. reached the same level initiation into a wizened apartment (bedroom and living room) located in a poor suburb of New York, under the worst financial conditions. None of them went to the Mojave Desert for such achievement. Note that when we talk about the desert, from the point of view initiatory, we are talking about a state of mind in which the initiate feels abandoned by everyone and everything - this is the real \"desert\" initiatory; \" dryness \"is another term for the same things. The desert is within ourselves. But many tucked the start, take the symbol for the thing itself. In my particular case, still not getting the \"Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel\", just got the \"vision\", which refers to one achieving minimal and totally different from another. But it was not the desert some (materially speaking), was even at home. The \"vision\" is achieved when you penetrate the heart of Malkuth, that is, when you reach Tiphareth to Malkuth. \"Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel\" is Tiphereth Tiphereth. That is enough for the wise ... But back to the interviewee.In his words he describes the period of ordeal in an obscure way, referring to an \"as Crowley\" and an order devoted to the \"dark side\" of the universe. I think he was very impressed with the film series \"STAR WARS\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"His statements are theatrical. Then, he says, giving his face a Saturnian aspect: \"before this attack Forces of Darkness, I realized being of the\" wrong \"(if it exists in this universe). What happened in reality is that he inked with fear at the prospect of facing up to the self, and like a spoiled child ran in search of salvation under the skirts of Mother Church of Rome.In describing this his \"adventure\", he makes several errors. First: There are two forces in the universe degladiando is absolute. The Manichean philosophy was one of those superficial attempts to interpret universal phenomena, ie the facts that we like are the \"Well\", and those who displease us are \"evil\". There is no absolute good and evil in eternal struggle for the \"soul of man.\" Jehovah, Satan, Osiris, Seth, Isis and Kali, etc ...are manifestations of one and the same energy, seen from the point of view different.Only after the full and complete knowledge of these \"amoral\" forms of energy manifestations (mental or otherwise) within the man himself is that transcend the conditions of so-called material world and become Masters, Wizards, etc ...Dealing with those forces can become a risk to the extent that there is no clear view of the subject. Regardless, we must realize that everything is projection of our own mind, that the universe reflects this mind with your dreams, fears, aversions, ambitions, \"gods,\" \"demons\", etc.. Apparently the \"wizard\" of television ignores all this, and your mind is quite confusing. Fear, my dear \"magician\" is the harbinger of failure, and you. And you failed irretrievably. Secondly: Struggle and danger exist in all dynamics of the Universe and of course in our lives. The danger is even crossing a street. If the universe were not dynamic, dangerous, there would be no incentive to overcome obstacles, so there would be no evolution.There would be challenges to overcome. In short, there would be a genius of a Nietzsche, a C. Jung, a Freud a Napoleon, Julius Evola one or Crowley. The universe is a coming - to - be eternal. Nothing is permanent, static, insurance etc.. There is no such place as \"heaven\", a place where one rests infinitely surrounded by angels playing harps, etc..Start up is traveling domestically in \"stratos\" deepest soul, the \"hells\" (ie \"below\" the worlds contained in ourselves), however in touch with everything that is within us and \"out of us,\" because we are the universe itself. All started that avoids this wholesome trip, this contact with the primitive universal energies, cosmic will, obviously, building castles in the sand.The Qliphoth are integral parts of the Tree of Life, and of course, our souls. So besides nonsense is IMPOSSIBLE to escape contact with these energies, with which we are constantly in touch. From the moment that man treads the path of initiation, automatically these energies are aroused and begin to perform their specific functions within the plan initiation. By giving up exaggerated value to the danger of these paths, waking up with fear (one of our Demons), and fear is itself the greatest barrier to Spiritual Enlightenment cumin. Becomes stupidity and fear of death, the madness of \"soul loss\". The ancient legend of \"selling his soul to the devil\" is idiocy, superstition invented by the Roman Church, so that through the fear you get stuck to it. Even if there were the devil, man can not sell his soul, for the soul is ONE with the Divinity manifested in our plan under the mask of personality. All these fears are the result of the ego, the only entity destined to disappear by the initiation process. The soul, the divine in man, can never be traded or destroyed. How can you, my dear \"wizard,\" an omnipotent deity and create a good be evil, an evil so grotesque, insulting and meaningless?Third: Crowley was never head of an Order, especially of an Order \"Satanic\". The Supreme Head of the OTO is Baphomet XI ° which, by the way has nothing to do with the man Crowley. And if you do not know the differences between the two, it is unfortunate ... Now, THERION assumed the role of Lord of the Aeon, and Perdurabo was just initiated into the Golden Dawn. The A. A. was never at any time the Church of Satan as declined to identify, in the theological sense, the magician goofy.The Church of Satan was founded in 1966 (this time Crowley had died) by Anton LaVey in San Francisco (USA). But this church is but a crude form of revolt Roman Catholics saturated the mind restriction imposed by the Church of Rome and its \"faithful\". Herein is the goofy big mistake: just because we believe in a devil if we believe in the teachings of the Church of Rome. Without him it would not exist. therefore we (Thelemites) do not believe in hell, and say by the way, NOT TRUE CRISTÕES. Thelemites are not Satanists. And if the \"magician\" is a goofy start, as he claims he should read the work of Blavatsky and there learn what it really means Satan.Moreover, look for the section dealing about Sanat Kumara. Room Mr. Mago also stated that the \"surrender\" to the \"Power of Light\" (ie, what he calls the Power of Light), one was brightly lit and dispelled the darkness (of the Order of Crowley, of course)."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"That said, let's see: who gives birth is obviously the driver of Light, and this reminds me that a long time ago a certain individual signed the oath of Our Holy Order Magic LUX with the bike, which is in turn half of LUXFERRE Latin word, ie \"Conductor of Light\", the same as LUCIFER. The Luciferism this magic is not evil to which the Churches oppose permanently. It is an authentic science of regaining the true place of humanity in a universal context. Luciferin was called because their preachers have incarnated, according to Qabalistic tradition, to bring the \"SACRED FIRE\" to men. were the bearers of Light, as the etymology of the word Lucifer, formed LUX (Latin = light) and FERRE (Latin = bring).Thelemic tradition lucifer is understood in these terms, as the savior of humanity, at least for that part of humanity that has been able to understand this principle.The Luciferian mythology is in fact older than the ignorant understanding and intentional distortions of the Judeo-Christian tradition \"esoteric\". Perhaps the oldest version of Myth of Lucifer is one of the Greek hero Prometheus. The two traditions differ in certain nuances, but the key is that Prometheus, willing to help and preserve humanity, brought the Sacred Fire fire and placed in the hands of men. The central point is that the Creator God (Zeus, in Greek mythology, and Yaldabaoth, in the Judeo-Christian tradition) wanted to keep humanity under their yoke, and slavery. But rebel figure of Prometus or Lucifer, helped the man bringing you the means to become as \"gods\". This is the fundamental idea underlying the Thelemic position and its connection to pre-and non-Christian attitudes toward myth.The Spirit rebellious Lucifer (Prometheus), paved the way for the emancipation of man, and consequently, their Salvation. According to this doctrine we can also analyze the Myth of Eden, where the serpent (NECHESHE in Hebrew) is the Messiah (in Hebrew MESSIAH) - Christós the (Greek) are ONE and the SAME. This can be seen through the Qabalah, Mr. Magician must know very well ...Nechesh = NChSh = 50 +8 +300 = 358 = MESSIAH MshYCh = 40 +8 +10 +300 = 358Both names, in accordance with the Laws of Gematria, has 358 as the sum total of the values of their letters, which indicates their unity.On this subject tells us Sthepen A.Hoeller (Professor of Religion Compares the College of Oriental Studies in Los Angeles). \"Snake, not mentioned by name in our report is actually the beginning of the Gnosis, the emerging consciousness is impulse to individuation \"(Jung and the Lost Gospels p.154)Christós is a messenger and son of the serpent and not the \"Creator God.\" This Christós proclaims Gnosis (Knowledge) and not Pitis (faith). The Serpent of Eden and is the same bronze serpent raised by Moses in Exodus, and the same snake wrapped around the bat Thot-Hermes-Mercury, the Caduceus, the symbol of medicine. It is also, in part, what we call Kundalini, or Serpent Fire of the Eastern Tantric Tradition. Returning will claim Mr. \"wizard\" on the light that dispelled the darkness. Now when you turn on a light, you create shadows. I doubt that anyone can go to Radiant sun without creating shade. The Infinite Light, that which does not create shadows is AIN and AIN is NOTHING where there is no Light or Dark. It is the ABSOLUTE LIGHT and DARKNESS ABSOLUTE, this is a great paradox Universal. See where it comes from the Black Hole, where not even light escapes.As a \"magician\" who is the goofy television may have heard of the ABYSS. Well, above the abyss that is, above the gap that separates the Supernal Sephiroth below the other, NO DUALITY. Light and Dark, High and Low, Left and Right, Good and Evil etc. Are the same as is \"expensive\" and \"crown\" are part of the same coin. In his time \"naughty boy\", that is when Mr. \"magician\" was still man and devoted to Thelemic Magick. And he sought to change the \"status\" Brazilian politician (very commendable thing), I had a lot of respect for him. But today NOT because he became a \"respectable\" citizen with bank account, social status.Accepting all the ills of our society wild, going to Sunday Mass, \"confessing their sins\" and communing with the atrocities committed by the Inquisition and dogmatic nonsense of the Church of Rome; dogma that I regard this as the greatest cause of misery in the world; dogmas that imposing the wild machismo of Jehova, and says that a woman is lost when it stops being a virgin for love outside of marriage, that is,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"when the copula is not \"official\" by the church. Dogmas that transform GREAT GODDESS IN A \"MARIA\" real monster physiological withdrawing the key attributes that characterize the woman - had a son without losing her virginity (always materializing symbols). Can you conceive a healthy woman with no period? Maria has no breasts ... And all of this is the \"truth and\" good \"for him. But what else is MARIA MAIA fertilized by Sol Notice that MAIA means THE GREAT WATERS and \"R\" is the letter of the SOL, hence MA (R) IA. \"And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.\"To Mr. \"magician\", those who are still in the battle for FREEDOM of Men, for the extermination of superstitions, whether in the physical, religious, or magical is the expression of evil. How can respect such a Boeotian? Throughout the interview he dares touch the name Raul Seixas. Now, both he and the unforgettable Raul were under our guidance initiatory, until at some point in their careers initiatives were put to the test, as is natural when it proposes a real job. Each of them reacted, as expected, differently. But Raul did not react with cowardice and remained faithful to Thelema until the end of his physical life. Always have the greatest affection and a deep respect for Raul Seixas.The reaction of the \"magician\" before the ordeal clearly showed his cowardice and fear without limits. The whole picture would be clear enough to me, long before those events, if I had heard the warnings from my old instructor about goofy. However my personal friendship by \"wizard\" television interfered with my judgment. Given this reaction, my instructor, just \"shrugged\" - the responsibility was mine ... Mistakenly thought he over time supplant the effects caused by the initial shock, as would be expected from anyone when it turns sincerely to GREAT WORK - psychically balanced, etc.. So imbued with good will tried it several times and in different time.But gradually, I realized how much he was obsessed by the \"devil\" that he had created in his heart. A vampire sucking it. Nothing else could do without their own help. Also noticed that my physical presence affected him. He knew now that the guy I knew no more. The Essence sustaining physical form had been replaced by something indescribably tacky and awful. It, itself was only a shell. The ego had dominated the healthiest parts.Therefore, I isolated myself from any physical contact with astral or thing. Her fear had pushed the meshes of the Black Brothers.For those unfamiliar with this term, open a bracket here: \"Black Brothers are those who remain focused on the ego. Are those who \"get\" the Abyss after attempting to cross it without proper preparations and conditions magical or mystical, ie, those who failed to destroy their egos. These remain here secreting his elements around their egos, as isolated from the rest of the universe. This isolation is, of course, only an illusion of the ego. They may even gain some prosperity in the lower planes. This prosperity depending on the inertia created by its previous practices magic or mystical, but are hopelessly destroyed, especially when a NEW AEON born of a new word is given to the world, which they can not and do not want to hear, and as my instructor said they continue to work with the disadvantage of a absoleto magic method, just as a man in battle, when their opponents use automatic rifles, and he simply bow and arrow. \" Brother Black is no minimum contact with the Divine Triad. Hence the Sr \"wizard\" goofy Featured remain, even today, is convinced that the \"good side\". But as it is written: \"Woe to those who believe in absolute good and evil.\"Any real start even the lowest rungs, not unaware that for the achievement of Kether, it becomes necessary to cancel all dualities. Balancing the pairs of opposites. In simpler words supposed to mean that we should \"marry God with the Devil\" within ourselves. In the movie \"The CRYSTAL MAGIC\", the process is shown in poetic form. The Real Man, Real Started, to see God in Hell \"of the Qliphoth. But this does not mean that the \"wizard\" goofy has become a Black Brother. I have no doubt that even he, having attained the Degree Black Mage. This became evident when, in his interview, he referred vaguely to Black Magic, in terms of \"Left Hand Path\" which is something quite different. It is likely, therefore, that he has become a mere black magician or sorcerer. What is a distant cousin of the Black Mage. The difference between these two, ie, Black Mage and black magician, is the same between a doctor and a nursing assistant. The term \"black\" is merely technical, having nothing to do with moral or theological considerations of the Church of Rome.Brother of the Left is not necessarily a Brother Black let alone Black Mage. It's just a matter of choice. Brother of the Left, or Brother of the Left Hand Path is therefore something quite different from"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"anything they can lay imagine. For an individual to become a Brother of the Left (which does not cease to be a disaster in his career initiatory) have to fully achieve the Grade of Exempt Adept; degree I doubt much has that goofy hit, or any other of his ilk . He in reality no more than a mere plaything in the hands of others, that is, emissaries of the Black Lodge.Guardian Angel: This is the most important topic I have selected to discuss here. correct term is The Holy Guardian Angel. The term used in the interview - Guardian Angel - was a way of wanting interviewed in his cunning malicious play with double-edged sword. He nods to Roman Catholics and Thelemites. Grand illusion. Thelemites never fall in this deception. Roman Catholics do. He claims to have seen only one of the arms of the angel. Now \"arm\", \"cocha\" \"muscle\" and other terms used in the coded language of the Bible are euphemisms for PENIS. Now I wonder what kind of angel is that this sample \"pica\" to his protégé? We Thelemites, we have nothing against anyone bites. For us, the Phallus is a symbol of creative power. This power also symbolized by the Bat, the Wand, the circle with a dot in the center and, in very special cases, by sword. But his strongest symbol is the CROSS.As previously stated, the Knowledge and Conversation of the SAG is the most sublime event that can occur at a certain stage of initiation of a career aspirant to the Great Work. It is the moment when he, tearing the veil of matter (Paroketh Veil, or Veil of the Temple, where the legend of Jesus), reaches the Sephira Tiphareth, the center of the Tree of Life, Sphere Christ. It is, in other words, the meeting with the Internal Christ.Happiness, joy, joy, beauty and excitement taking account of being at this time is so paramount that those who have achieved not find words to describe the event. And when be returns this \"encounter\" will never be the same ... See, for example, the biographies of Francis of Assisi, Theresa of Avila, Rama Krishna, Mahomet, and in several other traditions. The Knowledge and Conversation of the SAG is to say the least, an event outside the limited imagination of man.Supreme bliss, Satori, Nirvana, are some of the words used to describe - it. Could ever be afraid, as he felt the \"wizard\" goofy. And if the fear comes in that moment, then we can only conclude that the encounter was not with SAG is the Guardian Angel Adonai need to say anything else?Now a final warning: Stop, dear mr. \"Magician\" to talk about the Art of Alchemy. The gold which the true alchemists refer is not that Mr. Mammon. Eagerly sought to accumulate.The Gold of the Alchemists is \"Potable Gold\". If orient ...Now, to the astonishment of the \"wise men\" equal to the television, I must say that 666 is the sum of the numerical values of the magic square of the sun, and 3x6 = 18, number Qabalistic par excellence and the number of the Degree of the Knights Rosicrucian. Six (6) is the letter Vau - the son in YHVH. Three Six Three letters Vau are thus: ddd. See if crashers in secret, my dear \"magician\".There is a teaching designed to awaken the memory of men for the fact that they are glorious and divine nature, and that this world is a canopy of gods who dream. This science was called in ancient times, Luciferian. Today called Magick. This puts Mr..\"Magician\" and others like him as Luciferians, that is, if you really practice MAGIC OF LIGHT."}]
