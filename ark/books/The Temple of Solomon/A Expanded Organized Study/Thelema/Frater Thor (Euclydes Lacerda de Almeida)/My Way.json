[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"MY WAYBy: Euclydes LacerdaThis is the last phase of my life.Die shortly already know. She, the Lady Dressed in Black; come pick me up in pain and wounds in my heart, in body and soul,. Her sword reap the last breath of my life, like lightning from heaven spark in immensity. And this lady I lovingly embrace, feeling the heat and smell of the Universal Life Energy, throbbing in their breasts. Die in Infinite orgasm. I say this because I experienced a quick meeting with her, that was enough to understand well the meaning of life and death. Vivi and my existence in this world.Fought as a brave warrior, won battles and lost others, and realized many of my projects and dreams, not all of course, but some of the most important. I did not walk through the world as alienated, without direction and a philosophy of life.And this philosophy, guiding my steps, I have a man who was my spiritual instructor, Master in Art and Great Friend. He has delivered his body to the earth, and his spirit, freed, went to Great World, where we are one with Him Until today I have recorded in memory and heart, his lofty figure, libertarian and in full awareness of their duties, not only for their country but also to the entire humanity. Say that I idolize. No. This is not true. I have a healthy respect for him and special affection. He showed me with his words frank and energetic possibilities of my life and my virtue defects. If you do not follow all his teachings was because, at the time of our I was still very young to measure and evaluate them in depth. But I do not regret. Every human being has its orbit, and I just followed my, and this was his greatest teaching: be what you are. I certainly admired him greatly. We had a relationship well defined, which highlighted the mutual respect and deep friendship. I am 71 years now. I am condemned to die in the worst way sadder, and he predicted it years in advance. But whatever this destination even give Glory to Adonai that once felt your loving touch. Since that day no longer doubted its existence, and its presence, although sometimes my educated mind to the \"rational\" repelled this belief. But in the end I saw that was not vain belief, but sure. And all this walking was written in the stars millions of years before I was born in this land of humans.Am Gemini, and this is very complicated, as all being born under this sign do not know.Sometimes somo Castor and Pollux sometimes. Among all the ringtones that I received in my life, it was the strongest. Ahead of this had another touch, this touch is what led me through the past few years in the world. For him, this time, he performed in his female form, the figure most terrible, seductive and loving Universal Goddess: Bhavani Khali, the dark goddess who dances on the bodies of their worshipers and lovers. And feeds on their blood. Not blood red stuff that flows through our arteries, but that other existing energy in us all. And every time I contacted with this energy, I asked her to destroy me in a love embrace, so I could get rid of the shackles holding me that this Kingdom is pleased to elude us. It can only get rid of these shackles. But this freedom comes with many aches and pains. So. First she took my precious lifeblood of men.Unmet hurt my heart, and my hopes. And now, fourteen years later this touch, she is realizing her loving presence.Die Without a hurt even. Vivi well. Life has to be lived fully without the moans and not trusting in deceptive light of the mind disguised it in a bed of roses, this is for the weak.She has to be thankful in all circumstances, for this is one of the universe. recently life has given me the opportunity to know and love a woman. This strong new love is taking me out of the ordeal in which I lived. Being younger than me, it vibrates energy and gives me the dream to experience all the beauty that a woman can offer a man. Besides love I have immense affection for her, because she is my last glimmer of light in this final phase, in which man loses some of its strength as being. I bow down to you with tributes and the most true and strong. I hope to live some more time to continue to revere it and give you my last breath of love.Many will think I'm crazy, and if this is true it is the most sublime folly that a man could want. She is like the light of the moon that gently bathes the prairies and mountains in somber resplendence. With it I have had the softest encounters love. And I doubt there happier man than I when we kiss and smiled at each other .. In these moments I lose myself in your deep and shiny black eyes and give thanks to Adonai for putting you in my path. 27/05 / 2008 ev"}]
