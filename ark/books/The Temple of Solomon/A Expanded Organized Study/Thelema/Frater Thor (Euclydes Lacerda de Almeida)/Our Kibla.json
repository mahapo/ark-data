It is said by tradition that the Ka'abah, or Kaaba was built by Ibrahim (Abraham) and Smail (Ishmael) his son, and the legendary founder of Arab race, is buried nearby. Built outside the eastern block of the Kaaba is the Hajar al-ASWAD, the Black Stone. That's what this black stone was given to Abraham by the Archangel Gabriel. Five times a day, devotees Summi Muslims turn to Mecca to worship (prayer).The Muslims inside Mecca turn towards the Kaaba, and it is expected that every devotee at least make your life a pilgrimage to Mecca. The term Qiblah denotes not only the physical location of the Kaaba, but also, and more importantly, the DIRECTION for which a muslim (Islamist) around the face to pray.

Thus, the Lodges of OTO , \"Houses of Worship\" and Temples of the Gnostic Mass are \"targeted\" to Boleskine, and a replica of the Stele of Revelation will be on the most sacred point of the super-altar in the \"Middle of each temple consecrated to perform the Gnostic Mass.The Stele of Revelation is the stone funeral ANKH-af-na-Khonsu, a priest of Monthu who lived in Thebes during the XXVI Dynasty of Ancient Egypt. According to Crowley in \"ACROSS THE GULF\", Ankh-af-na-Khonsu was responsible for announcing the Aeon of Osiris, Aleister Crowley assumed the identity of the magical dead man Ankh-af-na-Khonsu as the living prophet of the Aeon of HORUS, the announcer of the Book of the Law and the Law of Thelema with the archaic energies of Ancient Egypt, renewed and transformed according to the cyclical evolution of the Aeons.In the Christian Mass, the cross is placed above the altar. The cross is a symbol of death and resurrection, and the altar is the traditional place of sacrifice. In many of them there are relics of saints buried inside, this is an old Christian custom of celebrating Mass on the tombs of martyrs. The shape and dimensions of ablonga modern Christian altars are probably derived from the shape and dimensions of Egyptian sarcophagi. The shape of the altar also reminds those of ARK OF THE COVENANT, which contained the relics secret foundation of Judaism, and about which the feminine presence of God, The SHEKNAH, it is said, appeared.In our Gnostic Mass, the Stele of Revelation is placed above the altar.

Also, the height of the Altar is precisely specified polegas 44: 44 is \\ d, DAM, the Hebrew word for blood, saying the altar as the place of sacrifice.

A Estela Cruz and serve the same function within their systems. Both are placed above the altar / sarcophagus sacrificial, as the Omphalos was placed above the burial place of Python. Symbolically, the Cross and Estela serve as a reminder of the Covenant of Resurrection between the religion's founder, who returns to life after his burial, and the participants of the ritual. Let us remember that the Greek word \"Estela (Stele)\" means both \"memorial\" and \"alliance\". Magically, they both serve as \"portals\" between the visible and the invisible world of mortality for immortality.Remember that stele has the additional meaning of \"a block of stone\", corresponding to the Cross Cubic Stone, the Black Stone of the Kaaba, and Stone alchemical immortality and \"support\" corresponding to the \"Path Samekh\" in Tree Life, which is attributed to TRUMP \"Temperance\" or \"ART\", which connects the Lunar Sphere YESOD with Solar Sphere of Tiphareth, and how the Cross intersect the path of Peh. The path of Peh being assigned to the asset \"TOWER\" or \"House of God\". Remember that the Kaaba is also called the Bayt-Ullah (House of God).The ESTELA IN Temple of the Gnostic Mass is indeed the line through which we commune with the subtle energies of Thelemic current, crossing the visible world with the \"invisible house\" located in Boleskine. The correct orientation of the Stele with Kiblah Boleskine symbolizes alignment with the Thelemic current, and magically ensures a strong bond with these energies.Boleskine located at 57 ° 16 'Latitude (North) and longitude 4 ° 30' West."}]
