[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"OTO AND Contradictions At that time, many prominent occultists believe that the ancient mysteries should no longer be reserved for the few, but become available to all who needed them. In the Spring Equinox 1973 received, Marcelo Ramos Motta, one of OTO Charter to work in First Three Degrees of the Order in Brazil. The project would form a group of interested people (men and women) in founding an initial core of the Order in our country. At the time, it was also aimed to publish several works of Aleister Crowley, designed to fill the gap, in Brazil, on the Thelemic system of Spiritual Attainment. The project was a successful bet. We, as inspiration, youth and desire to create a new mindset in terms of Occultism in Brazil, totally divorced from the standards system of the Slain God (Osiris-Yeshua). But certain events, caused by infiltrators Antagonistic Forces, changed this whole scheme.Before we dive deeper into the issue, we need to address certain considerations essential for the understanding of our narrative.1) I'm no master, nor magician, let alone a style that started in many individuals present themselves publicly;2) Do not make it rain, do not teach the \"way of heaven\", do not send anyone to \"hell\", let alone learning how to make money easily and without work, or make your neighbor's wife. I'm just a man, like any 18outro, who walks the face of the planet in search of self-realization;3) The term master is, for me, the clearest demonstration of the lack of truth - the biggest barrier erected between us and Understanding Ourselves (or the universe). So keep up the \"hierarchies\" about the knowledge but not the hierarchies of Wisdom. The idea of real Master is quite difficult to entendidade by the profane and those initiated by low-gau. The true Master is within us and outside of us, and only \"appears\" when you're really ready, that is when we (\"I\") disappear. The Master is not, and never was, a \"person\" outside of us. The Master should be sought within and not outside of ourselves.All it says over and outright lies, deception, and desire to dominate other about us. Only Instructors should consider, ie, individuals who are situated slightly ahead in the evolutionary scale, it is the hierarchy that should be respected. But remember that each star has its own orbit, one particular way. This, of course, contradicts the unnatural concept of equality of all men, so false that any real man should feel sick to their mere denomination.4) The idea of an external master addictive and it is written: \"Every man and every woman is a star\";5) The role of the instructor instructed to insist that their personal follow their own orbits, which are like stars. The true Master is, I repeat, in ourselves - in a deeper sense, it would be that which, in certain Schools of Initiation is called \"Holy Guardian Angel\", and other \"inner Christ\". A deeper definition would be \"Beyond Myself My Everything.\" A hierarchical point above ourselves;6) In the set of issues to be addressed here, include:a) The probable origins of the OTO His probable founders. Thelema and its links with other chains, etc..b) The development of the system and Thelemic OTO in our country and elsewhere.c) An analysis of the Ancient Rituals (the originals of those Theodor Reuss and Crowley reformulated within the system of the New Aeon.d) the question of the emergence of various branches of the Order, including the one created by Marcelo Motta in Brazil (the Branch, after the death of Marcelo Motta, divided into 5 other \"independent\").e) The reality about current \"Head of External Order (OHOs.).f) Other topics of general interest.As a secondary objective, the work will lend itself to demonstrate how the order system and guiding your way have been misunderstood, even by many of those saying it Thelemites or siblings of the OTO, and because the order suffered many tribulations in his career, especially in the periods between the years 1962-1975 and 1975-1997.However, do not say that is the truth. Gaps in this essay are numerous not to take as a complete and final"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"presentation. One has to also take into account the personal tendencies of the essayist. Before the work should be seen as an introduction - a group of more or less related tips and information to be studied and that I hope will serve any practical use to the student, not only of Thelema, as well as the other schools of thought .Everyone, without any restrictions, make the following suggestion: everything here has no practical use and not show some consistency, it will become disposable. however, that all approach the work with open minds, serene and devoid of prejudices, and with full freedom of judgment, especially to the facts presented in the years 1974 and 1975, about which there have been so many debates, many sensitivities personal evils understood, but few efforts towards a solution definitively ending the barriers separating the various branches of the Order, arose here and there at the whim of personal preferences in total disregard to a spiritual hierarchy pre-established.The last few years I have been very fruitful and provided opportunities where I could observe, puzzled, until you can go to human ignorance, widespread confusion, errors, and isolation infertile generated by empire mental conditioning to which we all, we were subjected links for millennia standards system of the Slain God. Not enough that we have witnessed assaults between various \"clans\" formed around individuals linked previously to this or that leader - some of them already deceased, and for that we should not consider them perfect, as is usually the rule do with one who has died, even if they have acted harmfully in society.Indeed, all this time lost in endless and fruitless harangues, wear in free energy, which could well be used more intelligently to the noblest causes in favor of proper disclosure of what is, in reality, the Occult, and alert what is going on around us in recent years.As the lights of this dying century, we see the need to urgently establish a clear and accurate reassessment of our position in front of the religion and the esoteric (or occult, I have use both interchangeably) as we know it today, ending the practice opportunistic and evil of those who, if using it for personal gain, have desecrated the ignobly. Only armed with great courage and determination and deep insight, we can end all this mystification irresponsible, criminal, we turned the occult, especially the one called Thelemic system.We can not bow down to those whose thoughts and actions prove they are not ready to understand the \"mysteries\", and the actual condition in which man finds himself at the time. We can not bow down to those who tried (and still try) to transform the OTO in a disorder, allying itself with forces clearly antagonistic to the laws of evolution, with the name of democracy. Incisively, the truth of the facts has to be said openly, without shame or personal considerations, or groups, for all to see in every detail. As said by Blavatsky \"The Secret is the Enemy of Truth.\"I In 1904, there was an incident of great importance in the annals of occultism.Alexander Crowley (aka Aleister Crowley) wrote Liber AL vel Legis (The Book of the Law), he dictated by Aiwass, an inhabitant of another plane of existence, endowed with knowledge far above the human. With this, according Thelemites, began the Aeon of Horus (a New Era of human evolution), replacing the Aeon of Osiris (or was the Dying God: Attis, Dionisios, Adonis, Osiris, Jesus, etc..).One of the strangest ironies of history is that there are limits to misinterpretations and misrepresentations of theories or systems, even in an era of unrestricted access to the sources. In the world of esotericism, there is most dramatic example of this phenomenon than what happened with the Thelemic doctrines (or crowleyanas) in the last eighty years. We have included references to Crowley and Thelema in the press, in the speeches of occultists in Aryans books and countless articles produced by people initiated or not. However, with few exceptions, it seems that these (especially in our country) even seen or read at a glance, a single line written by Crowley, or have a minimum of Thelemic practices. And here comes another phenomenon where \"esoteric\" very low category appear as \"great wizards\" connoisseurs of Thelema, and devoting themselves to explore the \"hidden knowledge\" to raise money and personal fame.Until 1904 we were, most of us, conditioned upon Osirian paradigm that established social criteria, the directions of scientific research and of course, the religious, supported the idea of sacrifice in favor of the individual and the collective provision, also embraced by Marx , \"equality among humans\", a fallacy invented to deceive the people and keep it attached to certain political theories. In short: it was established that the world should work according to the model (standard) adopted, or rather imposed by coercive power, financial, social and religious of an era in decline. In this context, we are trained in search, talk, think and act within the accepted paradigms as certain, true, etc.. Ideas out of this standard are considered bizarre, disturbing the established order, heretical, musing of unbalanced minds, viewed with high suspicion and totally undermined and dismissed as \"not consistent\" with the accepted paradigm. The"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Thelemic philosophy frees us from the shackles Osirian, but not in a hierarchy that must submit spontaneously on the Path of Initiation.Paraphrasing Antonio Carlos Fragoso: \"Our civilization (Christian, Jewish, Muslim, etc.) is in crisis, and we need to make a great effort to realize this. The technique, technicality and high technology, associated with a modern way of living, also technical increasingly stereotyped, pragmatic and less human, is pointing to the fallacy of another promise, by the means of production, the accumulation of wealth or extreme material development, the key to happiness (Today that has separated, increasingly, the man's man, man's nature, and man himself.

Attacks in the field of historical facts ascertained, the complex problem of the origins and development of the Thelemic Orders (mostly OTO) its most prominent characters and episodes. Fully meet the requirements of a widely experienced rigorous work in a field highly slippery. Albert Einstein said that only two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity. He added: but as the Universe have my doubtsI do not know embellish my words. They are direct, clear and without subterfuge, especially in the case of the subject as I intend to develop here.Not looking with metaphors, soften the dictated by my conscience. This is not my writing style, though, acknowledges that he has caused throughout my life, serious hassles and troubles. But it does not matter! We can not avoid these missteps. Is this an unfriendly way to express yourself, I agree. But it appears fraught with purity and authenticity, and, for that, I am vehemently criticized by friends of untruths, acting in our midst. This criticism coming mainly from factions linked to a certain esoteric and spurious \"Thelemic organizations\" [u1] , installed in the world in the last decades of the last century and developed under the \"leadership\" lame and zarolhas, embedded in a political and sick in a financial power enslaving, that has nothing to do with Thelema.I do not claim that people embevecidas by this type of \"system\" are bad in the sense that we commonly this word within the esoteric and theological standards. No! They are only misinformed, misled, and of course, fighting in defense of what they believe to be most true. This is natural. Most of these people ignore being guided by \"instructors\" malicious.These yes: with bad intentions. Deception is also the result of a lack of spiritual experience in the way, that is, these people underpin their views on pure theory misunderstood and often misrepresented. Never in daily practice, led by an honest trainer, because if so, would put up quite far from this kind of \"system\" invented by putrid minds embevecidas by their petty egos. These people do not realize that follow a \"false system,\" contaminated by several tributaries on its long journey to reach us.I am puzzled to note how people considered smart, abdicate their individualities to surrender to a doctrine explicitly dedicated to the exaltation of their little \"selves\" to the detriment of the True Entity existing within them. I say this because every day that passes, it becomes more and more evident the profound differences between the speech and actions of their members, who call themselves OTO and A. '. A.' .. I hear a lot of thing being said as if it were true, and not much truth being told with vigor. Second, can understand the speech of these people should be: \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\", but in reality, following \"Do what I want to be there all the Law.\" Pure exaltation of ego.There was a big turnaround in my concepts, both related to this type of \"Thelemic system\", as the other mystical doctrines flourishing in our midst so contaminated by falsehoods. I'm not only away from the old ways, but pointing the bow of my ship into the Light I put myself in another position. Fully aware of what this means, abandon the whole structure \"esoteric\" to which I've been on for so many years in a row, in the same way, some time ago, I broke the ties uniting that order as well known by all.Unfortunately, the highly emotional and controversial subject makes inevitable the lure of radical lunatics to our circle. As usual case, these are the ones that tend to shout louder and make more noise and take up more space in the spotlight than they really deserve.Because of the actions of a large group of eccentrics, the world of esotericism (not the Esoteric) has become political, marketed, etc. .. Mainly, so called, Thelemic. Thus, several OTOs proliferate and bog down in petty quarrels, lawsuits and endless controversy about the authenticity of documents and magical-true spiritual heritage. As if the matter could be resolved through discussions and legal acts.The \"system\" is there, but does not work.

Reading these should be of little interest to the Real Thelemite. It is difficult to get to understand the motives that impelled if we move in ways that leave aside the balance achieved quality sacred to anyone who considers Adept Thelema.II\" Today, the writer who wishes to combat lies and ignorance have to fight at least against five difficulties. You will need the courage to tell the truth, a time when everywhere strive to stifle it, the intelligence to recognize when to hide everywhere, the art of making it manageable as a weapon, the discerning enough to choose those in whose hands it to be become effective; finally need to have the ability to spread it among them. These difficulties are great for those who write under the yoke of fascism; those who fled or were expelled also feel the weight of them, and even those who write in a regime of bourgeois freedom is not free of its action . \"I hesitate to announce the theme of this text. There are dangers when we open certain doors - a danger beyond what we could imagine. The first is to generate expectations that perhaps are not met. Another is that to induce those linked to Thelema abandons it even as it sets its content. There are no mitigating circumstances. The subject has long history, centennial and controversial. But anyway it is our goal to pursue rigorously, and with exemption of mind, said by Bertold of the truth, without sparing pains faced during his quest. This will undoubtedly an arduous undertaking, especially when we ourselves were deeply and emotionally involved, and for years, with the theme being developed in this paper, ie: Thelema in general and the OTO and A. '. A.'. in particular. The fact, add up my magic hierarchical relationship with Marcelo Ramos Motta (esoterically known as Parzival XI °). A difficult personality to deal with, and understand, for their ideas and actions quite paradoxical and, why not say it, bizarre, to the mind of the common man, not familiar with the paradigms Thelemic esoteric.But it will not be difficult to understand the relationship of attraction and repulsion that everyone - with rare exceptions - developed in relation to the man., If we follow his brief career [1] as a popularizer of Thelema (OTO and A. '. A.'. ) in our country. Just consider his career in Brazil and in the U.S., while trying to be recognized as the legitimate successor [2] Karl Germer (deceased in 1962) [3] leader of the OTO (OHO)[4] truly thelemic. If the claim Marcelo was not genuine or not for us to establish here.Only we offer data and facts to the readers to decide for themselves the question, and facts should not be denied for not knowing how they may have occurred. It is unreasonable to assume that something is impossible, then we conclude that can not be proven. Every event must be judged by the evidence, but not through \"evidence of our preconceptions about the events.\"Marcelo Motta spent much of his last years in order to take control of the OTO, changing this acronym for SOTO (Society Ordo Templi Orientis) to register it in Brazil. At this time we have created and registered the New Aeon Society, in charge, in Brazil, to continue the work of the OTO Being the foremost disciple of Karl Germer (Frater Saturnus) [u2] in A. '. A. `., Marcelo Motta, considered the possessor of that right, but, in fact, was never patented to open a Lodge of OTO, it is also true that he, at any time, was formally initiated into the OTO degree in Your Order (IX °) it was given orally, by Germer, without any ritual, without which he spent the earlier grades. This was also the process used by Crowley to give to the IX ° Germer Germer was not formally initiated into the OTO, ie: he never went ritually by degrees before the IX °. This is recorded in one of his letters when he declares not be able to get the function OHO (Leader) of the Order. Motta MARCELO AND OTO \"It is my intention to maintain the OTO divided into three circles, each of three degrees: the external, the internal and secret. None of the three have great contact with each other, and the lower will not know the earliest as such. This corresponds to the degrees of Man on Earth, Lover and Hermit, and the IX ° is approximately parallel to the grade of Exempt Adept A. '.

The Grade XI ° corresponds, of course, the Magister Templi, and is completely outside the normal scope of the Order.Note that the correspondence between the degrees of the two orders is purely for reference purposes. For example, the III ° only really reaches the level equivalent to Zelator of A. '. A.'. when it passes the IV °, so in all cases. \" [5] The details of organization are not of great importance. What is vitally important is that the Secret Master may resign or off the organization, summarily, any member at any time, or all members of the board, without vice versa is possible. Nothing democratic idea, but essential ......It is imperative that the control is always in the hands of a member of X or XI ° °.

Especially when it strummed the Order. However, and unfortunately could not perform them. None of the groups formed by him, reached any tangible result. Members of these various groups, after the death of the leader, became bitter enemies.Educated, learned, [6] disciplined and severely uncompromising on issues of Thelema., Marcelo Motta attracted to all (or repelled) with his easy speech and their bizarre postures esoteric or profane. Never saw exalt itself, except in very special moments.Sometimes I looted conniving with myself about some of his claims [7] . I do not claim to have been here he a genius in esotericism, but much of it was coming. Remained attached to it, in our Thelemic esoteric studies and, for thirteen consecutive years., During which I was evolving mentally, morally and spiritually, within the parameters that deviate quite Thelemic those fed in society, so said Christian [u3]At least I overcame my fragile mental and spiritual, making me a harsh critic of myself and many secular and religious beliefs, that had nothing to do with the reality of our world. I radically changed my ideas. Currently, I'm not sure that this change has been beneficial in all points of view, except in certain specific circumstances, so even very specific. By this I mean not to be repented of my wanderings by land Thelemic. Quite the contrary. But the learning was too forceful and fast, not giving enough time to my self, to digest all that food esoteric. This provoked a 'egoic inflammation. \"In fact, I never knew achieve the balance needed to evaluate the teachings that were given me, nor ponder my reactions to everything I was offered so quickly and so fast.With reference to the inner personality of Marcelo Ramos Motta, Germer and Crowley never came to a definite conclusion: they were great initiates or true buffoons, or self deluded? How to sort Marcelo Motta, who undoubtedly owe much in the sense of a particular spiritual attainment? And how to classify certain attitudes burlesque Crowley?Even so, I think that a surplus arises in their favor.Marcelo Motta was one of the figures - and that no one can dispute - marked in the field of contemporary occultism of our country, and perhaps abroad. All the positive side, constructive, critical, dreamy, pugnacious, charismatic, paradoxically, intolerant, finally, Thelemic revolutionary, has already been said and written by others as \"Thelemites\" and not \"helemitas\". Who does not know the history of this enigmatic man, attentive recommend reading the text \"MARCELO RAMOS Motta, an enigma\" [8] , of my own and \"INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ARE NOT INTELLIGENT\" by Marcelo own. Through these two readings everyone to have as much information to draw their own conclusions of his character and that drove his life.This man, who had the reputation of being contradictory ideas in their acts, it was a controversial character who, without settling on attacking the morale and status cristista in particular, and the customs of worldly society generally directed their attacks for all sides (this trend is more accentuated in his last years of life), but also spared no efforts in attacking several other Thelemites and occultists, especially one that said \"start ups\" and sole representatives of \"Thelemic Orders\" (OTO etc)."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Marcelo Motta was born on June 27, 1931. His father, Samuel Catarino Motta was a spiritualist, and her mother, Elzira Ramos Catarino Motta was Roman Catholic. Always watched by intelligence services, had his apartment in Copacabana visited by agents of the DPE. Marcelo always attributed this oversight \"police\" the fact that he was connected to the Thelemic current.Marcelo, politically, was a staunch anti-communist., As can be noted in \"Calling The Children of the Sun\", p. 15: \"A word to tell you of communism. Whether disguise as primitive Christianity, whether it call itself scientific materialism, is neither one thing nor the other, because the early Christians worshiped the same God in Them, I mean the Gnostics, that the Catholic Church fiercely persecuted and decimated because he knew connoisseurs of great sorcery. As for scientific materialism, that is something that Communism was never being based on a number of axioms idealistic and romantic and that have nothing to do with the facts of science, as, for example, that men are all the same .... Even more, social organization preached by this \"scientific materialism\" is in stark contrast to the natural law of evolution by mutation and selection of species, because genetics teaches us, and the observation of the behavior of the species shows that variation of the standard produce evolution, and that survival must always be of the fittest \" IIIt is difficult to speak of the OTO, because, to our confusion, there are currently several OTOs At least 30 of them around the world. Each self-classifying as the only true.Happens with the OTO the same phenomenon that played the Rosicrucian Order into disrepute over time: appeared numerous \"orders Rosicrucian true\", with speeches the most unlikely and antagonistic and only interested in financial gain.The first split of OTO occurred, apparently as a result of Aleister Crowley have self-proclaimed world leader of the Order, and introduce it Thelemic philosophy (Theodor Reuss thing ever fought). From this date came two branches of the OTO, a Thelemic, composed of a small number of stores (England and Germany. Later in America), and other non-Thelemic, continuing to orient the original settings at creation by Theodor Reuss. To this faction allied most Shops (England, Germany and France). Nowadays, in addition to these divisions arose more other not only in Thelemic group as the other.Marcelo Ramos Motta was, beyond doubt, the initiator of Thelema in Brazil. Who says this merit belongs FRA [9] is completely wrong and misleading. The FRA has never publicly assumed to be a Thelemic organization, or privately to its members who lived and live under the illusion of the Aeon of Osiris. [10]After the death of Marcelo Motta, the Thelemic system in Brazil, became a joke (and bad taste, by the way), that is: a real chaos where various apocryphal OTOs and A. '. A..' S born like mushrooms in the fertile land, and degladiam publicly without the slightest embarrassment, and without any regard to the actual teachings Thelemic. Unfortunately Marcelo Motta was \"replaced\" after his death, by incompetent people who knew little or poor. These \"followers\", not knowing evaluate his ideas within an aspect Thelemic, confused and created all organizations that present themselves as true aberrations in context.Ideally Thelemic, seen in its purity, brings together all the elements with which they could create a society where its members (free men and women) enjoy the happiness and well-being compatible with our condition as human beings.However, it is more than clear that the idealized OTO by Marcelo Motta, is something that would be very close to a municipality with an aftertaste Nazis. This, however, does not take away the merits that fit to that odd figure of a man whose life, for good or for evil, was dedicated to the system initiated by Aleister Crowley in 1904.Marcelo Motta left a vast literary work (which must be read with care and attention, as a complement to Crowley) and several disciples who currently head up pseudo-Thelemic organizations. But these were lost themselves in the midst of deceit which unfortunately prevail in the world \"Thelemic\". Among these organizations towering walls of mutual suspicion, recriminations, accusations and dismissals. Overlaps and interconnections are inevitable in this chaos.Basic disagreementsI mean, for all know, there is no clear and harmonious connection between the OTO (as an order to Masonic) and System Thelemic philosophy of life and method of spiritual attainment. Or better said, there is nothing common in structural terms between the OTO and Thelema, unless stubbornness (and vanity) Crowley's Order in wanting to turn that into a medium for the dissemination of the system created by him; thing Theodor Reuss always fought and therefore expelled Crowley OTO (1922). Disputes between"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"\"Thelemites\" the \"OTO\", especially the arguments relevant to the relations between them, had become so vehement about the eternal conflicts between political parties radically antagonistic. The statement, said so it may seem a priori absurd, but we see that there is, if assessing honestly it without any preconceived idea.Part of the OTO only became \"Thelemic\" Crowley after having been \"appointed\" leader of the English Branch in 1921 [11] . The Order was founded and led (initially) by men deeply influenced by Christianity (Osirian System) [12] .Crowley himself was unable to definitively get rid of compulsions Christian [13] ingrained in his personality. His childhood, we must not forget, was marked and grounded in Christian precepts of the Plymouth Brethren, one of the most fanatical Protestant sects of the time. Fanaticism that shaped indelibly the future of Crowley. All their antagonism, and even hate, everything that smacked of Christianity (mostly Roman Catholic) arises there, though - and this is psychologically natural - in the deeper layers of his psyche, he felt strongly attracted to such precepts. This is not a hipostasia ours is a plain truth in plain sight. This dichotomy is reflected Crowleyan any more accurate analysis of his life, and Crowley has an unusual and complicated individual, in the same way as present Marcelo Motta in the future. Their views alternated over the course of more than fifty years of his career as a writer.Not infrequently he contradicted on the same page. The best way to pursue to obtain knowledge about this man and his dubious character, would be studying with Atenco and care, his biography written by various scholars, or read their own books. The best sources dealing on the subject is \"The Confessions\" (A. Crowley) and \"The Eye In The Triangle\" (Israel Regardie). Crowley, in a sense, was a Puritan in reverse. Interestingly, identifying opponent of Christianity, also practiced occult traditions Christian and Jewish, and Christian mystics put jobs - as Ignatius of Loyola and St. Theresa - in their long lists of reading for aspiring Thelema. This is fundamental to the understanding of facts that will be described later, which became the subject of discussions between \"Thelemites\", causing profound upheaval in the relations between them. Incidentally, this was quite common in the History of Thelemic Orders and therefore never firmly established in any country of the world.There are also serious doubts as Crowley considerations regarding the role of women in Thelemic. According to some scholars, among whom Peter Koenig, the system is totally geared Crowley misogyny. \"The woman is for man's use.\" This means, at first glance, that his only interest was directed to the woman's body, and he did not want nor spiritual nor intellectual her participation. This at least is what is shown by his words and actions concerning women. However, on the other hand, this \"eg denied by several other reviewers.Are more visible than the strong antagonism between the OTO - with its strict statutes, 'landmarks', coercive rules, principles and Masonic ritualism [14] - and liberalism Thelemic or \"Scientific Illuminism\" [15] . This fact has been induced to escquecimento by most members of the \"OTOs\" which hides looking for it anyway and the many interested new members, newly \"initiated\" obviously the disposing of real history and structure of organizations in flagrant conflict with Thelemic philosophy, as a doctrine central to initiatory work in the field.Within this context, it is quite amazing how they can enjoy 3 letters (OTO) generate so much discussion, so much animosity among people, knowing that these letters belong to the logo of an organization, whose members say worshipers of brotherhood and human freedom. We also hardly surprising to observe that most of these \"Thelemites\" loud defend individual rights and autonomy from the government and socieadade as a whole.But they only do this if these freedoms fit into their behavior patterns or personal ideals. After all, what is behind all this? What's so important to raise so many fights? Why fight both the leadership of an order pseudo Masonic disappearing?Many have been the answers to those questions. But nobody touches the core of the problem. In reality, behind all these struggles are the copyright of Crowley's books, which are worth a lot of money nowadays. Currently running in the U.S., and Europe, various legal proceedings in order to, once and for all, resolve the dispute between various factions. The subject is very complex and long to be discussed here, but it is known that Crowley himself appointed John Symons his literary executor. So John Symonds became the sole administrator of the Crowley copyrights.The initials OTO have been referred to the 'Ordo Templi Orientis', but in fact have a different connotation hidden features like a Masonic organization, founded, it is said, by Karl Kellner. However there are many doubts about the matter. It is very likely that it has been created by the Theodor Reuss, after the death of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Karl Kellner, took advantage of the reputation of this for the purpose of giving your organization greater conceptualization in Masonic media of the time.The Order, as an organization \"Masonic\" Osirian, was going well until 1922, when Crowley took over the leadership of the British Section (Mysteria Mystica Maxima). Henceforth problems began to emerge, and these, several divisions erupted. Most shops remained faithful to the old system, rejecting the Law of Thelema [16] , but others (mostly in English language) became Thelemic what, in our view appears as a deviation of the origins of the Order. It may be that this is the main cause of the OTO [17] did not sign up today's date as a single cohesive block. The Order was founded in the Osirian system (and this is a fact that nobody can deny) and \"adapted\" to the Aeon of Horus. [18] Many scholars argue that Crowley was the idea of creating a synarchy. In this he was followed by Germer, and later by Marcelo Motta. The OTO had Crowleyan colorations Nazis.Marcelo Motta actually supported the idea that the OTO should be an autocracy. An Autocracy, as can be deduced, evokes the concept of self-governance. An autocrat is one who has the power to command. It is very easy to confuse the meaning of fascism with autocracy, absolutism, etc..We know that currently the Order (if so we can name these days)) has been going through various crises and divisions. This has been happening since the appearance of Crowley, accentuating even further with the emergence of Caliphado (A North American organization (who says the only true OTO) under the leadership of such a Hymenaeus Betha). What this means can not yet be accurately determined but, indisputably points to something wrong with her ..... indeed something very wrong.Faction leaders OTO cried, currently, be the legitimate heirs of Crowley. After starting a McMurtry OTO in the United States (Caliphado), precisely in California, three others had cried the title OHO (Outer Head of the Order). Hermann Metzger was a former member of the Swiss OTO under the tutelage of Reuss. However, their cry was ignored by all members outside their country and he never insisted on it. He died in 1990.The other two were Kenneth Grant [u4] and Marcelo Ramos Motta (1931-1987).Kenneth Grant extinguished his Masonic character, going to call it Typhonian OTO.The Typhonian OTO functions as a cosmic web that does not operate through stores based on the physical plane, because its members are not - in a magical sense - centered on the Earth. Their areas of activity are located in hidden spaces which simultaneously include and transcend astral levels of consciousness. The OTO Typhonian is not, therefore, an organization in a worldly sense - this is controlled by the inner planes contacts focused today through a handful of individual currents channeled outside the circles of time and space. Referring to Thelema OTO Typhonian is considered to be the machine, while the A. '. A.'. is the Operator. (\"Kenneth Grant and the OTO Typhonian\" - P Koening)Marcelo Motta followed the trail left by Germer.There, and no one can deny, obfuscations and outright lies in the numerous religious and esoteric systems known in the world. But to them, at least in its founders, followers and most prominent members. (Affirm, however, be those serious, whose work is dedicated to the good of mankind. But it does not include the fussiness and falsehoods of the Roman Church, and evangelical Spiritualists) [19] . This has been happening since the beginning of the nineteenth century, a time when there were some of the best known \"spiritual masters\" and esoteric organizations linked to these teachers. It was at this time that started the legend of the \"Ascended Masters and Eastern gurus. Since the Theosophy of Blavatsky, with its scandals, until recently, always observed a sequence of deceptions, lies, strife, deceit and struggles for leadership of a pseudo \"spiritual elite\", encouraging his followers to venerate silly chimeras rather than stimulates them in the search for truth.So it has happened in all these years and all the mystical societies, fraternities esoteric, occult orders, etc.., Who have appeared on earth. This is the truth. Unfortunately.Apparently, this particular issue, there is no longer what or who to trust. In fact there never was. It is we who stubbornly shut our eyes to this reality. Trust these pulhas, these traps smelling incense, bought at the Camelot of the square, with its \"secret masters\" (Morya, Serapis, Venetian, etc), involves at least yield our souls to an authority capeng, unproven, because nobody can say with absolute certainty and sane in this \"authority.\"The elusive and abstract nature of spiritual growth stimulates all these mistakes, deceivers and deceived. The ability of a piano teacher can be measured by his skill in performing musical pieces, to a surgeon for its surgery. But how to measure the ability initiation of a man? How to measure your level of spiritual evolution, assuming that the notion of ability or initiatory spiritual evolutionary level in this context depends on purely subjective factors? Who can say with absolute certainty that you really do not"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"communicate with the \"secret masters\", or that is not in contact with the astral plane as it claims to be? Likewise, as it may be affirmed as opposed? Who can say with absolute certainty that the Thiana Apolonio was not an Envoy? Or it was merely a sham? The same questions can be raised in relation to Jesus of Nazareth. Absolutely can not in mysticism or magic, affirm or deny anything. Anyone who claims the contrary is mistaken or misleading. Who can affirm or deny that the views of Crowley were not caused by hashish or other drugs used for it? In reality, we fall in the same Mundaréu faith of religions.Only you can say (or deny) any internal phenomenon yours. Most fraternities, the sororities, orders, etc.., Based on highly dubious assertions, coming from \"communication\" between the so-called \"ascended masters\" and the founders and / or leaders of these organizations, with political powers on his pupils, and their own powers of persuasion, to support their \"authorities\". Blavatsky received and sent letters to the \"masters\" [20] , and Anne Besant followed the same path, which was not different from that of Mathers. Among all the spiritual masters, or gurus, or initiators, whose history we know, only Krishnamurti proved averse to these demonstrations of intimacy with the \"masters\" of the astral. He even ended with the fraud orchestrated by Anne Besant and Leadbeater around his own person: rather than accept such a mission \"Master of Mankind\" he stated to the contrary of this. Instead of searching based on an esoteric tradition states that it is up to the individual to discover their particular way forward in pursuit of spiritual liberation.Tradition can never be presented as a barrier to personal advancement, because each person is the one who can find their own way and for any other more. And you can be sure that this particular way (personal) is inserted in the Tradition. This is one of the great mysteries real and never challenged. \"Every man and every woman is a star.\" That the collapse of many fraternities, sororities and orders that emerged in our time (or even before) that wished to determine the path of others. Teaching methods of spiritual attainment is not the same as determining the spiritual path of others. Here's why Crowley himself, already near the end of his life, advises Germer to perform a radical change in the structure of OTO. But the concern of Crowley was late, the order is already over.IIITELEMA OTO AND DO NOT MARRY.He deceives those who think they can live thelemicamente and paintings belonging to the OTO while. If this is not true, so let's see:Being the OTO an order following the Masonic standards, ie, an organization whose work is collective and riddled with statutes, rules, hierarchies, etc.., It, by its very nature and definition, contrary to such a \"democracy.\" So we find the couplet in the official books of Thelema: [21] \"The Review Of Scientific Illuminism\" not consistent with the OTO, but with the A. '. A.'., whichever is designed devoid of a \"central power\", administrative or coercive \"on the physical plane, as some crazed want to invent exist, where they themselves occupy the highest positions. Recently, it has been commented on collective rituals, and initiation in Loja (or Temples, is the same.) This is nonsense. And then they want you to laugh at such \"masters\".The A. '. A.'. refers to the individual, their particular development, its initiation, its passage State Student of the Ipsissimus, he is not related to anyone, except for the Neophyte and introduces the student which can then be Neophyte, introduce. For him, the A. '. A.'. is no longer an order founded on a precise date, but a timeless chain formed by all those who \"seek the Light.\"The most critical inflamed our point of view come, almost without exception, the theorists of esotericism, believing that their ideas, their beliefs are the only and true - that the method adopted by them is the only valid one. Valid for what? To start foxes? Or, to emphatically declare :: \"my\" order \",\" brotherhood \", etc.., Is the only true\". Outside there is no salvation. \" Of course their \"orders\" are true. At least on the physical plane and for them. Do not disagree with that. In fact they are as true as it is the cohesive force - the herd mentality. As said one student of the subject: \"Currently the OTO is a circus without lions only have clowns.\"Before proceeding, I would like to stress here the words of René Descartes (whom they accuse of Rosicrucian) [22] at the beginning of his \"Discourse on Method\" that surely everyone knows, but I think it appropriate to recall them, especially when dealing with issues such imponderables when are those related to \"esoteric doctrines,\" or what they call esoteric doctrines."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\"Common sense is the best thing in the world divided, as each is judged so well endowed that it still more difficult to be satisfied in other things not usually wanting it more than they have\"We use therefore the sense in discussion and critique of the themes here embroidery.Once established, continue:There are times when we feel the frustration freeze our souls. It is an odd feeling, so hard that it hurts, and with it comes the doubt. And so when we invaded and taken, know to be the moment of deep reflection and, in parallel, we are led to one reassessment of our lives, our past acts, and through this, the guidance for new directions. It is as if we had arrived at a crossroads: a point from which we choose, without any outside help, unless one of our consciousness, the direction to follow from that moment on. If the inner voice which reaffirm the path we've been walking, okay, just move on. Otherwise, we must arm ourselves with courage, take our mistakes and errors, and change our ways, given the indications of conscience armed by common sense. Many have questioned as to why I started a gradual withdrawal, but growing and safe, the so-called \"esoteric doctrines\" [23] . And certainly also noticed a turnaround in my concepts related to OTO [24] . Know, however, that I am not nor will I be in it an isolated and unique in the annals of the Order. We hear from several others preceding me in this direction, and others will follow me, as they begin to open their eyes, using common sense applied in the analysis of the Order, and realize they are tucked in, that is, realize what is really \"belong\" [25] to an Order as the current OTO. So you can be sure: I will not be the first nor the last in this list.I recognize that this is an attitude somewhat strange after so many years on the adventures of the order in our country. But if the reader analyze carefully the Introduction to this system which was connected, and that many others are still connected, you will see that there is Thelemic anything, especially when that evoked pseudo Masonic organization. The facts that have occurred and continue to occur in the environment of the OTO (any of them), either in our country or in other words, descredenciam it as a System Initiation Real.Consider, however, that these are my reasons, my findings also. There are the reasons and conclusions of you who can, perfectly, then in other directions. Therefore, these my findings and my reasons these should not be at all, taken by you, unless presenting a concordance strong enough, between my motives and its between my conclusions and born of consciousness You. Never allow feelings of friendship, family, pseudo hierarchies, or enmity, etc., interfere in their private judgments.Concluding this paragraph, I emphasize the words of another thinker, a moment of clarity.\"It is helpful that all ideas, even the most contradictory and the most eccentric, come to light, they cause the examination and trial, and if false, common sense will do them justice, they will fall necessarily definitive proof of the universal control like so many others have fallen. \" IVMy interest in the occult or esoteric, use the word that most suits them, dating back to my youth, when I had the opportunity to read many authors, including highlight, Earl Rochester, Eliphas Levi, Papus, Blavatsky, Bulwer Lynton, Krumm-Heller , Prentice Mulford, Krishnamurti, etc.. Also, is this time my attraction to mysterious secret orders, that both would influence my life in the future. Everything was wonderful. I regaled me with tales of the Great Civilizations Lost and fabulous cities: Atlantis, Lemuria, Shangri-La, Duat, Agartha. In Theosophy lived the dream of the underground cities. But one day this fairytale collapsed. But this way, I can not deny it, much has been learned. Wanting to achieve my dreams, I started working in Freemasonry in FRA [26] , in AMORC, OTO and other more.MY CONTACT Thelema [27]My contact with the Thelemic system occurred in 1962 when reading \"Calling The Children of the Sun\", the first Brazilian publication dealing openly Law of Thelema, and apresentanto organizations linked at the time to the system.Strongly attracted by the contents of the book, I wrote to the author asking for my membership in one of the orders presented there.It is necessary, however, explain why the contents of the book attracted me so much.Two predominant"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"factors contributed to this attraction: First, of course, my insatiable thirst for esoteric knowledge - and the book had promise of opening new horizons in this specific field. Second, the natural result of my emotional state. Explain: Brazil found itself at the time, in great agitation sociopolitical and of course walking, striding toward an armed revolution, in which various political currents certainly would face, especially those more extreme left ( unions, workers, etc.) and right (capitalists, military, churches, etc.).My generation, making patriotic mettle, and the desire for radical changes in society, manifested itself in revolt against the \"status quo\" effect. Saw and felt on the skin, the political power of American capitalism, acting shamelessly in our affairs, and this, being supported by so-called \"democrats\". Thus, it was not difficult for a young, animated by political and social ideals, mix these longings with mysticism.We must also take into account the contents of the book there is a clear call for major changes because, according to it, all our problems would be fruit of a decadent was called Aeon of Osiris, in which were inserted the doctrines crististas, Islamic and Jewish - in short: all currents encountered in beliefs, so-called Age of Pisces or Virgo Aeon of Osiris (based on the Legend of God). Thus, in my enthusiasm \"esoteric-political,\" embraced the Law of Thelema as the fastest way to realization of those ideals. Thelema me emerged as a dynamic point synthesizing solutions to all these anxieties policies and mystical. And this was also the hope of many others, engaged in the struggle for change. The reader can check that all those who, at the time, embraced Thelema also worked in politics: Marcelo Motta, Raul Seixas, Paulo Coelho, etc..Only much later is that some of us realize that there was a bias pointing to certain fascist tendencies, particularly in the Order, called OTO This was because she was being misrepresented: malicious groups were taking advantage of its hierarchical structure, undemocratic, in the opposite direction. What we called change. Thêlemia actually proclaim profound changes in the structures of society and their ranking, but after a certain point, the path used by a majority of leaders (with rare exceptions) would be that of a highly despotic policy, determinedly right-wing, based a distorted and malicious interpretation of Liber AL. Unfortunately the OTO was the organization chosen for this distortion of Thelema. Here it must be said that most people confuse freedom (democracy?) With licentiousness, mess, etc.. In fact, we can establish that in the field of Initiation there is no democracy. There are many requirements (perhaps strangers to the profane) to rate a fraternity (order, etc.) as having actual initiation processes.It's more than likely will be harshly criticized and vilified after the publication of this study. And the biggest criticisms come not from my opponents from outside the system, but those saying yes to my supporters, those who exalt me as a true follower of Thelema (something that never ceased to be). Do not worry about it. Not rebaterei such attacks.Of no use, because they are normal reactions to human nature itself. Followers of \"Thelema\" - festival - of course try to provide 'evidence' contradicting myself. Anathemas are varied: among other things, some assert my failed attempt to \"cross the Abyss\" (later discuss this matter), or that I am a prey to forces related to Aeon, etc.. All those stupid things as well-known scholars of the occult; being the favorite dish of these blind.Many even say, in certain sacred beliefs, which went to \"the other side\". It is understood the \"other side\" as a \"Brother of the Left Hand Path\" (as if they knew exactly the meaning of the term), or Black Mage (long title used when wishing to belittle someone) plus the Aeon of Osiris or the Church Roman, or even be an agent in the pay of the FBI, CIA and the Vatican. It does not matter. The important thing is the voice of my conscience. What matters is the truth of the facts. Enough embromação. No more half truths about Crowley, Germer, McMurtry, Marcelo Ramos Motta, Master Morya, Cagliostro, Blavatsky, Magic Maat, etc.. Enough of schemes to justify the deep contradictions at the heart of colliding life of these \"leaders\" [28] , and these myths created around their nomes.Afinal all, they were also men like us, and therefore error-prone etc.. The big problem is that we are afraid to face reality and therefore weave illusions around us.For a long time the \"scholars\" system focused almost exclusively on language and literary genre of the texts without knowing - not even want to know - the message contained therein.How many accused of agnostics, traitors and even materialists have given life to mankind, without thinking of any reward in this or other worlds, believing in God indirectly through his works. Notwithstanding other, boasting up hierophants, masters, knights, cowboys and most other animals, thinking exclusively in bill saves the skin, and prepare a spot on the other side, or even on this side. After all, what good is the individual saying a Catholic, Protestant, Rosicrucian rider, cowboy, Umbanda, spiritualist, or whatever you want? The imperative is to serve humanity without embracing to pieguices religious. Someone really important wrote: \" No one, as the man leaning on the subject understands the extent to which Christ, by his Incarnation, is within the world, rooted in the World, to the heart of the smallest atom. \" It takes our attention to these words and understand them, absorbs them and live them."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"No matter the religious allegiance of those who wrote these words, whether Christian, Muslim, Jew or spiritualist. I do not have time and room to talk about all movements calling themselves the only true masters of divine truth, and may not, therefore, make a report about their endless rituals that sometimes idiots, primary, foolish, childish and up often stupid and violent [29] have existed in all ages, penetrating time until today, where they arrived with modernized garb: a practiced openly under the guise of religion, and other amoitados the excuse of mysteries. What mysteries? There will come a day when some of these \"Thelemites\" and \"believers\" will fall in real. I sincerely hope not too late for some of them (or them).I was born to be a builder of bridges that connect and not walls that divide. \"Thelemites\" OTOs of several existing today only built walls. And with these walls have achieved many divisions, even among themselves. Divide and weaken: a motto rather Machiavellian Roman, if you will excuse the allusion.I believe with Thelema humans would become better and, consequently, also the world.But first, we must expose the deceit of false telemismo.Freed of these unhealthy influences of \"telemismo\" (but not in Thelema), I decided to give my testimony of how much a particular formula, esoteric or magical, misunderstood, misguided, ill-intentioned, but possessing great power of persuasion can turn usurp , misguide and shuffle the lives of people and those around them, whether friends or enemies. In this same way I saw men lose everything they owned and died in the terrible loneliness of themselves. Witnessed the lie replace truth, and debauchery be confused with love. I saw the power of spiritual tyranny. I met people Meigas, delicate, full of tenderness, surrender to the madness of hatred unjustifiable against everything and everyone who does not agree with his ideas and thoughts. And in some cases, even against those peers. I lived with men and women madly devoted to powers passengers eager titles, degrees and commendations \"initiation\" would never exist, except in their heads and their leaders.VMASTERSBetter late than never, I find the idea of \"master secret\", initiatory organizations and all of the program, in most cases, hides vanity, ambition spiritual feeding on the satisfaction of seeing others around you, communing the same madness, the same ideals, the same fantasies. The fact that these satellites accept seeing their ideas and beliefs, sharing and living them, gives them comfort and security, because it seems to them as if it were a divine affirmation that they are right. The proof is that, many times, we hear them say, \"if we were not certain and with reason, and if the\" master \"had not with us, we would not have the number of followers you have, and this is also a fallacy often used organizations \"evangelical.\" But, I say, was never much quality.Try to understand that the admissibility of what we call \"masters of wisdom\" or \"hidden masters\", and settings that propagate, lead us to understand that they can anticipate and know events still plunged in the future. Dir will be in the \"now\", anteveriam distant events still to come ... But, compared to modern psychology, parapsychology and other parallel studies, such possibilities were not privileged to \"masters\" or wise saints, but peculiar to certain specified persons in special states of altered consciousness.Even so, I believe, if such \"secret masters\" have exceptional powers, and our lay understanding, and anticipating what would happen to their orders and fraternities in the future, would clearly interfered with or at least mitigated the successive breaks in the same unit. After all these orders and fraternities were not created by the \"masters\" to promote human evolution, and therefore should not be more well groomed?On July 17, 1964, I received the following letter from Marcelo Motta: \" Dear Lord: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the LawThere are several legitimate initiatory Orders, and all of them are in contact with the current of the New Aeon, as it could not be. There is, moreover, an immense amount of false orders instituted by Roman priests, communist agents, financial groups and political parties, as well as demonic entities entrusted with the job of destroying the chains of the past. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.In general, you can follow one rule: all current activity remains obedient to legitimate authority that is"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"initiated in touch with the currents of the Aeon of Horus, because it is in contact with the Magus who started the particular stream, and all obey the Magi Magus of the Aeon - the Word, and the Word of the Aeon - the LOGOS AIONOS in Greek. Recently, as you know, the Grand Orient of Brazil returned to ally and obey the Grand Lodge of England, the traditional chief of the Old Rite. Consequently, one would expect an improvement in Freemasonry. There are, however, several fake stores working in the country, and if you were appointed to Freemasonry I would advise you to inquire whether the Lodge in particular that you were given is linked to the Grand Orient of Brazil or not.The Big East certainly has a list of stores that are in harmony with its validity.The Church of Rome is not counted among the streams of activity remain obedient to lawful authority that initiated because the Church of Rome never obeyed legitimate authority of the Logos of the Aeon of Osiris, as you may have found reading my LETTER to a Mason. The Church of Rome is a shameful deception which caused immense harm to humanity while there. Say as existed because she is dead, and its dissolution is inevitable. Healthy parts - if any - will be reabsorbed in legitimate mainstream Christian.Some quick word on the rest of your letter. First of all, Umbanda, is as much as I could investigate a serious movement, but that the amount of \"terraces\" legitimate is negligible, and the amount of false \"yards\" of quacks, and sorcerers, is huge. 'The Caboclo the Seven Crossroads' is the way that the Logos assumed AIONOS to manifest in Umbanda.Beware, however, with the imposters! Every pseudo-spiritual entity that does not accept Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law is a false entity, demonic. Be warned lords. The same applies to fake shells that are manifested in spiritual centers are claiming that Ishmael. Ishmael, like all legitimate spiritual entity, accepted the Law of Thelema. Be forewarned you. This issue of dealing with \"spirits\" using the current Aub, unprotected, is infinitely dangerous. Personally, I avoid contact with Roman priests, spirit mediums and macumbeiros precisely because of the filth that infects the aura of such people.Exceptions prove the rule, of course - but exceptions are always very few. A great personal integrity, a pure life (which does not mean castrated!), Serious intentions and lofty sentiments am some cases provide protection and inhibit the expression of larvae and shells. But around repeating that such cases are rare. Most spiritual centers, \"yards\" of Umbanda and Roman churches are psychic centers of pestilence . \"The letter is long, but you can appreciate how its writer was predicting everything that would be in the development of OTO today. Everything he said can be enjoyed, not only with respect to the pseudas OTOs, but also with respect to other organizations \"mystical, esoteric, that arise in our day as weed in flowery field.VIPasscodesIt is not unknown, for we all, from time immemorial, the use of a symbology and esoteric secret codes in documents is a constant. This was done, as it is said, to prevent unauthorized or unclassified had access to knowledge belonging to an elite gathered around an organization or occult brotherhood. In the design of some authors, this minority feared their knowledge, falling into inappropriate hands, were misrepresented and misused, putting humanity in danger. I disagree with this thesis, as it establishes itself in a fallacy. To explain my point of view give an example here now are not we, unholy, we are placing the humanity in danger of a nuclear extinction, more rather a closed elite knowing and manipulating nuclear secrets. Is not we who are doing experiments with genetic engineering, creating real monsters, either in the vegetable kingdom, the animal is and perhaps in hominal. If that does not demonstrate the misuse of the secrets of nature, then I confess my ignorance. We all have a right to know what our governments, our scientists, our leaders and our military know they are doing or planning to do, because after all, it is we who will suffer the consequences of these initiatives, whether they are right or wrong , good or bad. With esoteric secrets are the same. Thelema does not say that \"the law is for everyone?\". Not Blavatsky said that \"the secret is the enemy of the truth?\". Do not say these two statements the months ma thing?Say that the minority who manipulate this knowledge \"secret\" do not want to share with us because of such knowledge give them political, social and religious without challenges because most of us are slaves of their own superstition, and fear to question them ( if it is shown that the Emperor Constantine never saw the symbol of the cross in the sky with the inscription \"With this sign you will conquer\" the whole basis of the Church of Rome falls to the ground). And even more: the disclosure of these \"secrets\" become obvious nature of these elites and their real goals. Formerly the Church of Rome tortured and burned in public who doubted its dogmas (secrets), or who belong to other religions.Besides the aforementioned divisions, Thelemites split into two distinct factions since the death of Crowley, a wing, which I call exoteric, which joined the majority, and esoteric.The first I comment following the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"injunctions of [30] , the second being willing to study deeply the book, not taking into account the I comment.However, we must agree that the OTO is necessarily anti-democratic. Democracy arises, the OTO as absurd and impossible ideal, since the \"Will\" is unconscious. Therefore, under the Order, the degeneration of democracy is inevitable. Even taking into account the insistence on the sovereignty of the individual, the OTO is assigned to an autocracy.However, the autocrat must be divinely identified with the True Will of the total society, that is, it must achieve a perfect annihilation of the ego. Thus, it should become a \"spiritual king\", the leader of the \"Great White Brotherhood\", and his court formed by those who eventually \"crossed the Abyss.\"Degeneration of democracy in communism is, as told by Karl Max, historically inevitable.At this point we can see the similarity of the form of government Thelemic {one practiced in pre-invasion Tibet.The above said, this should be made clear, refers to the vast majority of orders, fraternity, groups, associations esoteric character, not to a particular order, etc..References to name some of them are used as examples only circumstantial. René Guenon already said: \"there is no initiation democratic\", as was confirmed by Plato: \"Democracy is the government of the ignorant.\"In various religions or initiatic orders (secret or not), we find these codes, these dogmas.What no shortage kabalisticos numbers, formulas, diagrams exotic and statutory scattered everywhere, coming - so it is claimed - an antique undetermined and unexplained. [U5]Even in our days, the use of secret codes is well known. We see the Goetia [31] , in Kabbalah, the Alchemical treaties, among politicians, the military, and of course the famous intelligence services of all countries (most of the time, constituting a parallel government to cool, and not giving minimal satisfaction to taxpayers). Away from me state categorically that all these groups are linked together; although the hypothesis is feasible.It is almost certain that most occult orders have an underlying connection with political groups and intelligence agencies, and that is at the level above the popular understanding, a kind of gigantic code, which we have misread, or not know how to read.That is: after having spent much of my life dedicating myself to the subject \"occult\", awoke to facts not yet clearly seen due. Maybe - who knows? - Due to my narrow-mindedness, and the emerging result of beliefs without any solid foundation. [32]However, to get rid of these beliefs, I began to rethink my life, my convictions, and re-evaluate my \"knowledge\" esoteric. It did not take long to find me before vast and murky horizon, unfolding before me like a snake evil: and the more steadied my attention over the horizon blackened, showing me a landscape quite different from that created by the illusion of false occult. Noticed also that in the same way, others are confronted in this blackness. Therefore, someone should warn them. Therefore, I decided to take responsibility, because I actually, in one way or another, help them to enter the trap.VIIThe OCCULT PHENOMENON IN TODAYSOCIETY, POLITICS AND RELIGION The occult or esoteric, use the word that suits you (give all the same), in all its colors and trends, is experiencing at the present time, by a huge boom. Nobody ignores this fact.This is good or bad, you ask. In my point of view, any expansion of these doctrines, of how it is being done, is an evil to be fought. There is great interest in the disclosure of esotericism wrong, especially by those hiding their real intentions. Look carefully how this expansion occurs in all social strata, as if it were the true esoteric Democrat, replacing religion in decline. I'm not against replacing the decaying religions. However, I can not agree that the substitutes are worse than replaced. Is hatching a rapid growth in the number of new systems orders, brotherhoods, associations, research centers, teachers, guides, initiates, etc..As a side effect of the phenomenon, the number of readers and books, manuscripts, communications, exhibitions, considerations, debates on the topic that excites the crowd and enriches the houses printers and bookstores. Get on the Internet! You will be awestruck by the enormity of \"sites\" about.

He did not decimate an entire herd for the pleasure of killing indiscriminately. There is a big difference between the act performed by the lion and the one practiced by man. Man is the only animal that kills for the pleasure of killing.

While it is true that the FRA uses to this day rituals based on Aeon of Osiris[10] - E. Note: The Osirian egregore subconsciousness is tremendously strong in the race. Are more than seven thousand years of operations. The FRA kept very secret its connection with Thelema. This was revealed only to initiates of high degree and chosen among the most recanted their individualities. So the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"FRA has not publicly disclosed its connection gift \"the greatest black magician of the world,\" as Crowley was appointed in the media of the time teleguided frankly, as always, by the power and the Roman clerical capitalist. Marcelo FRA Motta was initiated on 19 August 1948. After contacting Thelema, withdrew from that Brotherhood (1957). \\ Own a copy of \"Gnosis\" (official newsletter of the FRA) 1949, which is a little poem written by Marcelo Motta, titled \"Stone Flower\".[11] - E. Note: There are serious doubts about this \"appointment\". Crowley himself, in his Magical Diaries 1921, states verbatim: \"I proclaimed myself OHO (Outer Head of the Order). Some scholars claim that the subject Theodor Reuss ever wondered in naming Crowley as his replacement.[12] E.-Note: The structure Templar / Masonic (introduced, it seems, in 1903) and only designated OTO after Kellner's death (1905) was not important to the late occultist who worked in their Circle without order system. There are no documents showing that even Kellner has ever used the term OTO. Your Circle was called \"The Inner Triangle\" (see \"The Espermos-Gnostics and the Ordo Templi Orientis\" - Peter Koenig) In fact, the history of OTO is extremely complicated (rival claims to apostolic succession ',' mutual recriminations and expulsions.[13] - E. Note: The Osirian egregore (Christian) is tremendously strong in the atavism of race. Are millennia of strong performance.[14] - E. Note: All based on the Legend of the Dying God, that is, the formula of the Old Aeon. It was only after the death of Kellner (1905) that created the Theodor Reuss OTO-system consisting of seven degrees pseudo-Masonic, that worked, so it was said, in the Seven Chakras of the astral body of man, whereas magic degrees (VIII and IX) were given directly from \"mouth to ear\" to the member who reached the corresponding degree.This rule lasted until recently, having been changed by the \"Caliphado\" (one North American OTO). The X ° only the designated leader of the country (King). For a better ingormação on Caliphado see \"The True Story of the Caliphate\" (Marcelo Santos AC)[15] - E. Note: To say that the OTO developed aspect of Tantric Thelema, and A. '. A.'.he Qabalistic is plead ignorant on these paths.[16] E.-Note: Featuring this crisis we can mention here the famous Coferência Weida, in 1925, in which several esoteric gathered to discuss about Crowley being accepted or not as the leader of the OTO as well as several other organizations. The components of this Conference were: Heinrich and Helena Tränker Karl Germer, Degree, Eugen Birven Grosch, Martha Kunzel, Dorothy Olsen, Norman Mudd, Crowley and others. This resulted in a large conference room. Germer, Mudd, Kunzel and Leah Hirsig sided with Crowley. The others decided to remain independent.[17] - E. Note: The OTO as a Masonic order iniciáica can not follow a structure based on democracy. The OTO is autocratic, and this principle should govern all its development.[18] - E. Note: Not quite. This \"adaptation\" was partial. The Ritual of the III ° is still based on the lendada God (Hero) killed. Only in this OTO \"Hero\" (God) has another name and Arab origin.[19] - E. Note: Roman Catholicism, in the western world is revenge for over 2000 years, must be retired and removed urgently because it is a lie and a focus of blind and one-eyed. You can no longer withstand the mountain shams, lies and deceit that prevail in the world of organized religions. See how classic example of the varied \"relics\" Christian: Holy Shroud, Pieces of the cross \"True\", etc.[20] - E. Note: As a Masters needed to write letters to communicate with someone.[21] - E. Note: That is a veil placed before the eyes of the Aspirant.[22] - E. Note: If Descartes had belonged to any fraternity with the current name Rosa Cruz, he would not have been mentioned here, because it would not have written \"Discourse on Method\" which is a book based mo sense of scientific reasoning.[23] - E. Note: But the Esoteric Real.[24] - E. Note: Notice that I said to the OTO, not with Thelema. This observation becomes necessary because many people have confused these two things as being one and conveniently titrado conclusions about my current position.[25] - is the Notga: From the point of view Thelemic, belongs to no man anything, but things belong to him.[26] - E.

Note: Thelema is a mystical philosophical and cultural system based on Liber Al vel Legis, which sums up the apparent simple premise: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law, this phrase having been used by Rebelais in his book \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\". St. Paul, in turn used: Love and do what thou wilt[28] - E. Note: In Brazil and abroad (mostly in North America) is a large number of these leaders. To inquire into the OTO English (Kenneth Grant) on such a LF was said senior representative of that organization, I received the following reply: \"...... LF is well known to us as a fraud, and Repeatedly We have asked him to stop misrepresenting himself.He is not a representative of Kenneth Grant ...... \"[29] - E. Note: Recently, I heard through people worthy of credit, there is an organization in our country, using a type of \"Polish corridor\" in the initiation ceremony. This corridor candidates are assaulted (lead edge punches and feet, and other things) the command \"initiators\". I would not believe these stories, but ....[30] -I comment. A notice in Liber Legis be banned tacitly establishes the interpretation or simple discussion of the text of the book. \"Those who discuss the contents of this book should be considered as centers of pestilence.\"[31] - Goetia is a branch of magic that deals with the evocation of spirits.[32] - As the Christianity preached there. [U1] Thelema is a cultural system and mystic created in 1904 by Aleister Crowley. Is based on the phrase \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law Although it may seem, the phrase is not a license to moral anarchy and social and mystical. The phrase determines descobera of True Will that transcends \"our desires\". Do what thou wilt is not the same as Do what thou wilt .. [U2] Germer himself refused to accept the OHO obregações Since he ecreditava the OTO Reuss had more authority than the OTO Crowley [U3] Society, said Christian, like Marxism, is based on the concept of equality of all beings, when the evidence is plentiful that natural law in this respect is variation from the norm. The social organization preached by Marxism is in stark contrast to the natural law of evolution by mutation and selection of species, because genetics teaches us, and the observation of the behavior of the species shows that evolution produce variations from the norm. [U4] is my current belief that Kenneth Grant, Outer Head of the Order called OTO Typhonian has more authority than anyone who cry out for it. Crowley wrote in 1946: about Grant: \"... a clear gift of the Gods\" and the writing in his diary in March 1946: \"Value of Grant: if I die, or go to the United States, shall be a man trained to tomr account OTO English [U5] What I can not understand is as old as knowledge still did not solve the great problems of humanity. Now I had the secret of eternal life, I will share with everyone and evidently would not die. How, then, these gentlemen, whose power and knowledge in all these science die? It is said to be a secret giving eternal youth and perfect health, and yet, those who claim to possess you get older, get sick and die. How can it be that in knowing the alchemical power to transform lead into gold, I die in poverty?"}]
