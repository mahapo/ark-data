[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Why Change the name of Abram and Sarai? There is a plethora of issues relating to the Holy Scriptures of all peoples. But as most of us are inserted in the Western Tradition, we should stick only to the Old and New Testament.It is said by sages from different eras, the closer the source, the more water will be crystal clear river. So, to answer certain questions, we will source, without however forgetting that all water stream receives many tributaries in its course until it amalgamates currents become ONE at BIG SEA.It is stated that the \"Mystical Tradition of Ancient Hebrews\" has three Scriptures: The Book of the Law of the Prophets formed of five books (Pentateuch) that we know as the Old Testament, the Talmud, or collection of comments about that scholars and Kabbalah (or Q (a) B (a) L (a) H) or mystical interpretation of the same book. Of these three books, the rabbis say that the first is the body of the Tradition, the second its rational soul and the third your Immortal Spirit. Some men read with profit the first scholars studying the second but the wise meditate upon the third.For better understanding of this little work is necessary to give here a summary of the rules and rather crude methods of biblical exegesis. This my exposition, I apologize for any omission, since it is an extensive and complex field and difficult to condense.These three methods of interpretation are:A - The literal - simple historical exhibition and the body of the Law;B - Hamil√©tico - elucidations moral, spiritual and rational principles of the Bible;C - Kabbalah - the mystical secrets and disclosure practices.The general principles of Kabbalah concise follow rules established by rabbis between 422 BC and 400 AD At the end of the century. XIII, circa 1280, began circulating in Spain a Hebrew text (handwriting) written by Rabbi Moses de Leon. This work, the SEPHER there ZOHAR (The Book of Splendours) shook European intellectuals both Jews and Christians, during secs XIV, XV and XVI. This book would become the great work of the Kabbalah and Jewish Mysticism. A historical analysis of Kabbalah can be, so we started the Zohar as a point of reference and describe all Kabbalistic literature, the teaching of doctrine and the people involved before the publication of this work and then, all events after its appearance. Among the best known scholars of Kabbalah could cite: Pico de Mirandola, Guillermo Postel, Robert Fludd and more recently M. Elliade, Dr. Encause, Max Muller, AE Waite, MacGregor Mathers, Crowley etc..The Kabbalah is divided into four main fields of study:1 - Kabbalah practice;2 - Kabbalah literal;3 - Kabbalah unwritten;4 - Kabbalah dogmatic.The Kabbalah literal which is in turn divided into three parts:1 - GMTRIA (gematria)2 - NVTRIQVN (Notariqon)3 - ThMVRH (Temurah)Gematria - is based on the relative numerical value of words (do not forget that the Hebrew letters are also numbers - the end of the work give these values). Words of similar numerical values are considered to be explanatory of each other and the theory also extends to sentences. As an example we have the letter shin value 300, a number equivalent to the numeric value of the word RVCh ALHIM, Ruach Elohim, the Spirit of Elohim. The letter Shin is therefore a symbol of the Spirit of Elohim (note that the design of the letter has three flames). We have R = 200, V = 6, Ch = 8, A = 1, L = 30, H = 5 and Y = 10, M = 40 where 200 +6 +8 +1 +30 +5 +10 +40 = 300 . Similarly we ACHD, Ahad (Unity), and A AHBH, Ahebah (Love) have the same numerical value 13.AChD - A = 1, CH = 8, D = 4 (1 +8 +4 = 13)AHBH - A = 1, M = 5, B = 2, H 5 = (1 +2 +5 +5 = 13)"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"That is to mean that love is Unity. There are infinite number of examples. Note also that the word (or name) IHVH value is (10 +6 +5 +5 = 26), which is twice 13. this is an issue that we intend to study in another work.Notariqon - the word derives from the Latin \"Notarius\" written summary. Notariqon There are two ways: the first way, all the letters of any word becomes the initial or abbreviation of another word, and the letters of a word, a sentence will be formed. Take as an example the word BRAShITh, Berashith, the first word of Genesis. With this form: RAH BRAShITh ALHIM ShIQBLV IShRAL ThVRH (Berashith Rahi Elohim Shyquebelo Israel Torah). \"In the beginning Elohim said Israel would accept the law.\" This is the same process as an acrostic, for example: the word \"fish\" in Greek ICHTHYS form (I) esus (Ch) remains (Th) eos (Y) us (S) oter, \"Jesus Christ Son of God Savior\" . Here also we have because the fish have been the original symbol of Christians.The Notariqon in their formula is the reverse of the first. In this formula the initial or final or letters or both averages are taken of a sentence to form another word or words. Thus, Kabbalah is called ChKMh NSThRH, Chokmah Nestorah, \"Secret Wisdom\". If we use the initials of both initial and final letters of the words MI IOLH HShMIMH LNV (Mi-Shamayimah There laulah Leno (That will take us to heaven? - Deut. XXX, 12) formed MILLION, Milah, \"circumcision\" and YHVH, the Tetragrammaton inserted therein, imply that God commanded circumcision as a way to heaven.Temurah - means swapping. According to certain formulas, a letter is replaced by another preceding or following the alphabet, so another word spelling is different from the first fully formed. The most commonly used formula for this operation is called ALBTh. In this case, we split the alphabet in half (The Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters) placing a portion below the other like this:KIT Ch ZVHDCBAMNSOP Tz QR Sh Th LThe name of this formula is taken from the six pairs of initial letters ALBTh. So, using this formula, the word Ruach, Ruach, Spirit or Divine Breath, so DtzO. There are three methods Temura but are rarely used.Now lets get to what interests us in this article: the change of name of Abraham and Sarah. At first sight it seems to be an act quite illogical or even futile. Firstly, we should note that all the traditions of the Middle East, whether Jewish or Islamic, consider Abraham as the father of all those nations and religions that exist there. This is confirmed when we see in the Islamic tradition that the name is synonymous with IBRAHIM imaum, the Priest, the same meaning persian Pishva or Sovereign Pontiff. Somehow this leads us to consider that Abraham is not a personal name but a title of honor: (Abraham) means \"father of a multitude\" while (ABRM), \"FATHER LIFTING\". This can also be considered in addition to many other explanations that AB is Father in Hebrew and RAM is Sun, emerges as another form of honorific. However there is a deeper meaning when we see that changing the name of God only Abrham for ABRAM A LETTER added the letter \"He\".This letter is full of symbolic manifestation of the Divine Breath, being the Mother of All Things. Note that if we take the letter of the word YHVH IOD left us HVH, ie EVA. The letter \"He\" is as stated above, event. It is the letter to be pronounced you have to sniff the air, ie breath, take breath and manifestation is the breath of life. See all the names of God presented in the Old Testament has an \"H\" except one name representing the unmanifested (AL or EL).Eheieh, Jehovah, Elohim, Elohim Gibor, Aloah Va Daath, Tzabaoth, Elohey, Shaddai El Chai, Adonai Malech.Legend has it that when \"He\" presented himself before God - Blessed be Your Name - for their \"work\" in the Universal Creation, was given form along with the letter Vau (V or U) and Yod (I or Y), the Sacred Name YHVH and pursue this holy function par excellence.The \"He\" is the symbol of breath. Life is expressed in the breath. The word He (He + Aleph) which gave its name to the letter, is an interjection meaning \"behold\".In the name Abrm there He thus then God He entered one of the letters of his name on it, making it Abrham and other Sarai (Shin Resh + + Yod) which becomes SRH (Shin Resh + + He). So the couple before sterile (without the divine breath) becomes fruitful: Sarai (nobility) becomes Princess Sarah (a young fertility). Abrm (Father of Elevation) becomes Abrham (Father of Crowd) this is the Father of all the people of Israel. Note: call attention to the fact that Hebrew is written from left to right."}]
