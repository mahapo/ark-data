This essay will examine the theories on which divinationdoes — or is purported to — operate, and discuss the value that ithas for the practitioner. We will restrict our discussion to those formsof divination in which the symbols are manipulated by the magician(such as the tarot, the I Ching, and geomancy) as opposed to those inwhich the magician is purely passive in the production of the symbols(such as necromancy, astrology and augury).In terms of “foretelling future events,” the various operational the-ories of divination can be classed into three broad categories:1. An agency — either external or internal to the magician — withboth a knowledge of the divinatory system being used and aknowledge offutureevents, is able to influence the movementsof the magician into manipulating the symbols so as to produce— according to the rules of the art — a symbolic representationof thosefutureevents;2. An agency — either external or internal to the magician — withboth a knowledge of the divinatory system being used and aknowledge ofpresentevents or the hidden causes behind them,is able to influence the movements of the magician into manipu-lating the symbols so as to produce — according to the rules ofthe art — a symbolic representation of thosepresentevents orcauses, and the magician is then able to infer future outcomesfrom this knowledge; and3. The layout of the symbols is based purely onchance, and isunrelated to either present or future events.3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4The theory of the agency with a knowledge of future events isthe most “traditional.” As Crowley writes inMagick in Theory andPractice:The theory of any process of divination may be statedin a few simple terms.•We postulate the existence of intelligences, either with-in or without the diviner, of which he is not imme-diately conscious. (It does not matter to the theorywhether the communicating spirit so-called is an ob-jective entity or a concealed portion of the diviner’smind.) We assume that such intelligences are able toreply correctly — within limits — to the questionsasked.•We postulate that it is possible to construct a com-pendium of hieroglyphs sufficiently elastic in meaningto include every possible idea, and that one or moreof these may always be taken to represent any idea.We assume that any of these hieroglyphics will be un-derstood by the intelligences with whom we wish tocommunicate in the same sense as it is by ourselves.We have therefore a sort of language. One may com-pare it to a “lingua franca” which is perhaps defectivein expressing fine shades of meaning, and so is unsuit-able for literature, but which yet serves for the con-duct of daily affairs in places where many tongues arespoken. Hindustani is an example of this. But betterstill is the analogy between the conventional signs andsymbols employed by mathematicians, who can thusconvey their ideas perfectly without speaking a wordof each other’s languages.•We postulate that the intelligences whom we wish toconsult are willing, or may be compelled, to answerus truthfully.The theory of the external agency with knowledge of future eventsis fraught with the most insuperable difficulties, most of which shouldbe familiar. Firstly, of course, there is no reliable evidence whatsoeverfor the existence of the type of entity which is being postulated. Theworld is full of stories of gods, angels, goblins, fairies, gnomes andspirits, yet never has any convincing evidence of their existence beenfound. Whilst we cannot state with confidence that they donotexist,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5we may consider their existence to be so unlikely as to make placingany weight or reliance on their supposed communications exceedinglyunwise.Secondly, even if we allow for the possibility of the existence ofsuch entities, there is equally no evidence foranyentity possessingthe knowledge that they are purported to possess. Indeed, the posses-sion of a knowledge of future events which is anything other than aneducated guess or projection would fly in the face of the foundation ofmodern physics. Whilst there is noa priorireason to doubt the ex-istence of entities with non-coporeal brain structures, there certainlyare reasons to doubt that they would possess the kinds of impossibleknowledge and abilities that this theory imbues them with. Mankindtoday possesses a knowledge of the universe which may have beenconsidered impossible even a few hundred years ago, let alone a fewthousand, but this has not enabled him to lay aside the laws of physics,and we may justifiably assume that any other entities, no matter howmuch more advanced, will be subject to the same restrictions.The theory of the internal agency with these powers is subject tothe exact same difficulties. We know that man possesses far more ca-pabilities that he commonly exercises, but to suppose the ability toforetell the future with precision is one of these capabilities is reachingbeyond the bounds of probability. Were man to be in possession ofsuch an ability, one would consider it likely that at least one individualthroughout the history of humanity would have learned how to reli-ably harness it, but we have no reason to suppose that this has everhappened.We may appear justified then in discounting the existence of anyagency, external or internal, with the precise knowledge of futureevents that our first group of theories presupposes. The uncertaintyprinciple notwithstanding, however, we do know that the universe doesoperates in a more or less regular manner, and that detailed knowl-edge of these processes together with a detailed knowledge ofpresentcircumstances enables one to make predictions of future events withvarying degrees of reliability depending on the situation at hand. Forinstance, the position of Jupiter with relation to the earth six monthsfrom now, the time of tomorrow’s sunrise, and the time of the nextsolar eclipse can be calculated with an extremely high degree of accu-racy by anyone familiar with the basic principles of astronomy and aknowledge of the current situation. Similarly, we can predict that inone thousand throws of the die, the number six will be visible of thetopmost face approximately 167 times, and that the more throws weperform, the more reliable our prediction will become."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6Thus, it is far more reasonable to imagine the existence of entitiesfar more advanced than us who, possessed with a far more advancedknowledge of both the workings of the universe and its current cir-cumstances, will be able to predict future events with at least a fargreater degree of precision than we are, without having to ascribe tothem any kinds of supernatural power. Indeed, our own history isfull of examples of this kind. Until the development of probabilitytheory, humanity was unable to make any kind of detailed future pre-dictions. The Romans used to play dice games with elongated dice,the narrow faces being far less likely to “come up” than the widerfaces, yet the payouts bore no numerical relationships to this asym-metry in likelihood. Going further back, the ancient Greeks believedthat knowledge was something to be derived from logic rather than ex-perimentation and observation, and considered that “random” eventswere beyond any sort of quantification whatsoever, which naturallymade a systematic and scientific approach to predicting future eventssomewhat difficult. Indeed, there is an argument to be made that itwas the development of probability theory from the sixteenth centuryonwards that was primarily responsible for liberating mankind from asubservience to fate and destiny, primarily responsible for providingmankind with the ability to bring future events in fields as diverse asengineering, agriculture and economics within the realms of calcula-tion, allowing him to wrest a degree of knowledge and control over hisown future and the future of his society from Fate or the Gods, whichis of no mean service.Just as we are far better at predicting the future now than were ourancestors of five hundred years ago, so we may reasonably suspect thatentities far more advanced than us may be equipped to make a far morereliable prediction of the future than us simply by possession of a betterunderstanding of thepresent. Of course, such a theory has severeproblems of its own. Firstly, we have to imagine that such entities,impossibly more advanced than we are, are interested in spending theirtime communicating with us lesser mortals on — and to be on constantcall for — questions such as the fate of Aunt Maud’s favourite pet cat.There is no more reason to suppose this to be true than there is tosuppose that we would be prepared to answer divinatory questions putto us by cows, all the while concealing from them the fact that we arereally planning to eat their flesh, and to turn their skin into shoes andcoats, especially when we often refuse to answer such questions put tous even by our own children.Secondly, the sheer mechanics of the process of divination requireus to ascribe to these entities supernatural powers of no lesser degree"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7of unlikelihood than the ability to precisely forektell the future. Forinstance, if we consider a tarot divination, we must consider the entityin question to have:•A full knowledge of the symbolism used therein, in particular inhow it relates to the lives of men, which may be wholly removedfrom their own lives;•A full knowledge of the current positions of the cards in the deck;and•The ability to influence the manual operations of the divinerin order to ensure that he shuffles the deck in the exact wayrequired to bring the necessary cards to the top of the deck, inthe correct order.Not only that, but unless we are to presuppose in the completeabsence of evidence that one form of divination is favoured by suchentities, then we must ascribe to them similar powers to manipulatethe yarrow stalks or coins of the I Ching, the drawing of the marksof geomancy, the flightpaths of birds, and the writhings of the necro-mantic victim. We must also assume that these extremely unlikelyand inconvenient methods are the level best means of communicationthat such beings can think of. If these entities are able to manipu-late the manual operations of the diviner to such a level as to makethe tarot divination meaningful, then we may suppose that they mayjust as easily cause those hands to simply write out the answers tohis questions in plain language, without the need for all this unneces-sary silliness. Occasionally arguments are put forth that these higherbeings have evolved far beyond such a base concept as language, andnow can communicate with each other and with us purely throughsymbol, although how this knowledge is supposed to have been dis-covered is never made clear, and we are forced to conclude that suchideas are merely apologies or excuses, presented as a justification foran irrational belief.Similarly, if we are to ascribe this ability to an internal agency, thenthat internal agency must be able to perform such physical operationsas well havethe kind of advanced and conscious knowledge of theuniverse and its operations that is preventing us from answering ourquestions ourselves, which is extraordinarily unlikely.There is another theory which is extremely attractive, particularlyto many in the “new age” movement, which Carl Jung describes in hisforeword to Wilhelm’s translation of theI Ching(emphasis mine):"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8Now the sixty-four hexagrams of theI Chingare theinstruments by which the meaning of sixty-four differentyet typical situations can be determined. These interpre-tations are equivalent to causal explanations. Causal con-nection is statistically necessary and can therefore be sub-jected to experiment. Inasmuch as situations are uniqueand cannot be repeated, experimenting with synchronicityseems to be impossible under ordinary conditions. In theI Ching, the only criterion of the validity of synchronicityis in the observer’s opinion that the text of the hexagramamounts to a true rendering of his psychic condition.Itis assumed that the fall of the coins or the resultof the division of the bundle of yarrow stalks iswhat it necessarily must be in a given “situation,”inasmuch as anything happening in that momentbelongs to it as an indispensable part of the pic-ture. If a handful of matches is thrown to the floor,they form the pattern characteristic of that mo-ment. But such an obvious truth as this reveals itsmeaningful nature only if it is possible to read thepattern and to verify its interpretation, partly by theobserver’s knowledge of the subjective and objective situ-ation, partly by the character of subsequent events. It isobviously not a procedure that appeals to a critical mindused to experimental verification of facts or to factual evi-dence.Crowley illustrates the deterministic theory of classical physics inan extract from his diaries quoted in Chapter 9 ofMagick in Theoryand Practice:If I strike a billiard-ball and it moves, both my willand its motion are due to causes long antecedent to theact. I may consider both my Work and its reaction as twineffects of the eternal Universe. The moved arm and ball areparts of a state of the Cosmos which resulted necessarilyfrom its momentarily previous state, and so, back for ever.Thus, my Magical Work is only one of the cause-effectsnecessarily concomitant with the case-effects which set theball in motion. I may therefore regard the act of striking asa cause-effect of my original Will to move the ball, thoughnecessarily previous to its motion.In the same way, the theory illustrated by Jung postulates that the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9“chance” layout of the tarot cards, or the turns of the coins of the IChing, are “due to causes long antecedent to the act,” and are part of“a state of the Cosmos which resulted necessarily from its momentarilyprevious state, and so, back for ever.” Since it — along with allother current conditions — resultnecessarilyfrom the momentarilyprevious state, then we can suppose that it ischaracteristicof thatpresent moment, and that an examination of the chance layout of thetarot cards, for instance, can therefore yield information on the currentstate of the universe that could not be obtained through simple directapprehension.This theory is, as we have noted, extremely attractive to peoplewho wish to believe in the power of divination, whilst preferring toavoid the more overtly ridiculous assumptions, such as the objectiveexistance of impossibly powerful non-corporeal beings or hidden abil-ities. However, it does involve some equally difficult assumptions. Ifthe chance layout of the tarot cards is characteristic of the moment,then we can write down a sentence on a piece of paper and that isequallycharacteristic of the moment,regardless of whether we writeconsciously or not. There is therefore no reason to suppose that thechance layout of the tarot cards yields insight into the moment in anybetter way than does the act of us consciously choosing to write a sen-tence such as “I will shortly become exceedingly rich!” and thereforeno more reliable or useful. The theory is therefore just as unsatisfac-tory its more obviously difficult cousins.It appears, then, as if all the theories of divination which involve thearrangement of the symbols having any kind of significant explanatorypower over either current or future events are fatally flawed in one wayor another, and that we should therefore reject them. However, ouranalysis has been entirely theoretical up until this point. We mayconsider that, theoretical considerations notwithstanding, there is asurefire way to find out if the arrangements of the symbols have thiskind of explanatory power, regardless of from whence we imagine itto arise, and that is to test it. The normal questions of divination,involving as they tend to do events in our lives which are complex,interconnected, and subject to interpretation, are difficult to assessin this manner. If a divination indicates riches, for instance, it willusually be possible in the following six months to identifysomeeventwhich could be said to fulfill the prophecy. Of course, by obtainingmore specific answers (such as the stipulation that the riches arise fromsome kind of mineral discovery, for instance) we can alleviate some ofthese difficulties, but we can always question the skill of the diviner.However, it should be possible to obtain from divination answers to"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10questions such as “is the ball in box one, two or three?” and testit far more rigorously. It can, will, and often has been argued, ofcourse, that the governing spirits will not debase themselves so faras to be tested in this manner, which would explain any inconclusiveresults, but this argument — founded as it is on pure speculationabout entities of which the proponent has no knowledge — is just alittle too convenient for the scientific mind to accept. Naturally, nosuch testing of divination has ever yielded conclusive evidence in itsfavour, so we may consider these theories of divination to be highlysuspect on both theoreticalandempirical grounds.This leaves us with only one alternative — to accept that the layoutof the divinatory symbols is, in fact, random, and bears no meaningfulrelationship to either current or future events, and has no explanatorypowers over either of them. This would appear to debunk the practiceof divination entirely, but this is only true if we suppose that divinationhas no other valid purpose, which turns out not to be the case.As we have mentioned, the ability to both understand the presentand to make reliable predictions of the future depend upon a knowledgeof the processes at work, and a knowledge of the current conditionsupon which those processes operate. It follows that this ability will behampered by the diviner’s lack of knowledge on these things. One verysignificant impediment to the diviner’s ability in this respect arisesfrom a tendency towardspersonal bias. To take an extreme example,the man suffering from paranoiaknowsthat everyone and everythingis out to get him, and interprets all of his perceptions in this man-ner. On a more mundane level, one person may fail an exam and hispsychological makeup may lead him to conclude that he is thereforea total duffer in that subject area, and that he always will be. Aperson of different character experiencing identical circumstances mayalternatively conclude that he merely requires more practice before hewill become the master of the subject. Clearly these interpretationsmay be expected to have a significant effect on both future eventsthemselves, and on future interpretations, since both will have sometendency towards self-fulfillment.What would be of immense value to the aspirant to self-knowledgeis an ability to interpret events in a more-or-less objective light, in away free from personal bias and outside of his established subjectivethought patterns. Unaided, this can naturally be incredibly difficultto do, because he will inevitably tend to think in the way that hetends to think. The value of divination is that it provides the aspirantwith a definite set of symbols, all of which have relatively objectivemeanings, that can be used as the basis of an interpretation of fu-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11ture events. Since these symbols are definite and relatively objective,this interpretation will not derive from the aspirant’s own tendencies,although naturally it may be coloured by them. Even if the interpre-tation turns out to be invalid, this process effectively forces the divinerto “think outside the box,” to consider alternative interpretations thatmay otherwise never have occurred to him.At the very least, this practice may enable him to obtain a morerounded view of the current situation than he may otherwise have beenable to obtain, and this may cause him to make a more measured andappropriate decision even if he ultimately rejects the interpretationthat the divination has given him. Further, as he continues in thispractice, he will become increasingly able to think independently, andthe effects of his personal bias may lessen over time. There is nosubject about which is is more difficult to think impartially that one’sown being, but repeated practice may rightfully be assumed to lessenthis difficulty. If the aspirant’s objective is indeed to “know himself,”then such a practice will naturally be critical to his development.For instance, the result of an I Ching divination consists of oneof sixty-four possible hexagrams, with variablechanging lineswhichresult in a movement to one of the remaining sixty-three hexagrams,or to no movement at all. There are therefore 4,096 possible combina-tions, all 4,096 of which can be used to view a particular situation ina different and distinct light. Even if the aspirant eschews divinationas a method of foretelling the future, but obtains a different one ofthese combinations each day by which to interpret his day’s experi-ences, then he will relatively rapidly develop the ability to interprethis experiences from an arbitrary and unfamiliar standpoint. By sodoing, and by comparing to the interpretation he may otherwise havearrived at unaided, he is likely to gain great insight into the way hisown mind works, which will expand the degree to which he under-stands that mind enormously, and may enable him to start observingthe tricks his mind plays on him as they arise, giving him the abilityto divert them and do a much better job of maintaining an objectiveview. This ability will be of immense value to him in his quest forself-knowledge.Thus we can see that the true value of divination is not in its abilityto foretell the future at all, but in the fruits of its practice, in the sym-metrical expansion of awareness1that enriches the aspirant’s under-standing of himself and his environment enormously, and, ironically,also enables him to predict future events with far greater reliability1See my essayThe Method of Lovefor an in-depth analysis of this concept."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12than he was previously able to do. One can only build self-knowledgeby seeking out the unfamiliar, and observing one’s own reactions, andthe practice of divination is a simple and effective way to achieve this.The effectiveness of this practice is enhanced if the population ofsymbols themselves is possessed of what we may term “wisdom.” Ifwe presume, for instance, that each of the sixty-four hexagrams ofthe I Ching represents some fundamental state or change of state,and that together the set of sixty-four comprises acompleteset ofsuch states or changes in state, then the study of the symbols andtheir relationships to each other can be assumed by itself to lead to asignificant enhancement of insight, providing as it will an exposure toconcepts and their relationships that the aspirant may otherwise notbe exposed to in his daily life, or at least, may not apprehend. In thesame way as a study of physics enables one to apprehend the forcesat work in nature, so a study of a complete set of symbols of life mayequally enable the aspirant to apprehend the forces at work in his ownlife and in the lives of others, and may leave him far better equippedto successfully navigate that life. Regular and prolonged practice indivination, requiring as that practice does the consideration of themeanings of multiple symbols in varying relationships to one another,may be the most effective way of conducting this study, since it forceshim not only to consider specific combinations of symbols in a degreeof detail which he would not obtain from simply reading a book aboutthem, but also to consider those combinations in the direct contextof his own experiences, which will bring them to life and enhance hisunderstanding of them greatly. Even if the population of symbolsitself is not “complete” or “perfect,” we can hardly suspect such astudy to be of anything other than the greatest benefit. What is more,these benefits will be of far greater value to him than the benefits ofdivination under the “traditional” theories, which even in their mostadvantageous functions will serve little more than to guide him towardsthings that he doesn’t really want anyway.Therefore, the true value of divination exists not in its purportedfortune-telling properties at all, and we can safely discard that whichoffends our good sense and still be left with a tool of enormous poten-tial and benefit; indeed, by rejecting the spurious explanations of thesupernatural and apprehending its true value, we may indeed be farmore greatly inclined to indulge in the practice in the first place, andhence far more likely to reap the benefits which persistent and regularapplicaton can accrue."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Bibliography[1] Crowley, A.,Magick in Theory and Practice, Lecram Press/Paris-France, 1st edition, 1929[2] Wilhelm, R., (tr.
