If thou thyself hast not a surefoundation, whereon wilt thou stand to direct the forces of Nature? 1.Know then, that as man is born into this world amidst the Darkness ofMatter, and the strife of contending forces; so must his first endeavour beto seek the Light through their reconciliation. 2.Thou then, who hast trials and troubles, rejoice because of them, for inthem is Strength, and by their means is a pathway opened unto that Light. 3.How should it be otherwise, O man, whose life is but a day in Eternity, adrop in the Ocean of time; how, were thy trials not many, couldst thoupurge thy soul from the dross of earth? Is it but now that the Higher Life is beset with dangers and difficulties;hath it not ever been so with the Sages and Hierophants of the past? Theyhave been persecuted and reviled, they have been tormented of men; yetthrough this also has their Glory increased. 4.Rejoice therefore, O Initiate, for the greater thy trial the greater thyTriumph. When men shall revile thee, and speak against thee falsely, hathnot the Master said, “Blessed art thou!”? 5.Yet, oh aspirant, let thy victories bring thee not Vanity, for with increaseof Knowledge should come increase of Wisdom. He who knoweth little,thinketh he knoweth much; but he who knoweth much hath learned hisown ignorance. Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is morehope of a fool, than of him. 6.Be not hasty to condemn others; how knowest thou that in their place,thou couldest have resisted the temptation? And even were it so, whyshouldst thou despise one who is weaker than thyself?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"6Ordo Templi Orientis - Oasis Orator’s Handbook7.Thou therefore who desirest Magical Gifts, be sure that thy soul is firm andsteadfast; for it is by flattering thy weaknesses that the Weak Ones will gainpower over thee. Humble thyself before thy Self, yet fear neither man notspirit. Fear is failure, and the forerunner of failure: and courage is thebeginning of virtue. 8.Therefore fear not the Spirits, but be firm and courteous with them; forthou hast no right to despise or revile them; and this too may lead theeastray. Command and banish them, curse them by the Great Names ifneed be; but neither mock nor revile them, for so assuredly wilt thou belead into error. 9.A man is what he maketh himself within the limits fixed by his inheriteddestiny; he is a part of mankind; his actions affect not only what he callethhimself, but also the whole universe. 10. Worship, and neglect not, the physical body which is thy temporaryconnection with the outer and material world. Therefore let thy mentalEquilibrium be above disturbance by material events; strengthen andcontrol the animal passions, discipline the emotions and the reason,nourish the Higher Aspirations. 11. Do good unto others for its own sake, not for reward, not for gratitudefrom them, not for sympathy. If thou art generous, thou wilt not long forthine ears to be tickled by expressions of gratitude. 12. Remember that unbalanced force is evil; that unbalanced severity is butcruelty and oppression; but that also unbalanced mercy is but weaknesswhich would allow and abet Evil. Act passionately; think rationally; beThyself. 13. True ritual is as much action as word; it is Will. 14. Remember that this earth is but an atom in the universe, and that thouthyself art but an atom thereon, and that even couldst thou become theGod of this earth whereon thou crawlest and grovellest, that thouwouldest, even then, be but an atom, and one amongst many."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"7Ordo Templi Orientis - Oasis Orator’s Handbook15. Nevertheless have the greatest self-respect, and to that end sin not againstthyself. The sin which is unpardonable is knowingly and wilfully to rejecttruth, to fear knowledge lest that knowledge pander not to thy prejudices. 16. To obtain Magical Power, learn to control thought; admit only those ideasthat are in harmony with the end desired, and not every stray andcontradictory Idea that presents itself. 17. Fixed thought is a means to an end. Therefore pay attention to the powerof silent thought and meditation. The material act is but the outwardexpression of thy thought, and therefore hath it been said that “thethought of foolishness is sin.” Thought is the commencement of action,and if a chance thought can produce much effect, what cannot fixedthought do? 18. Therefore, as hath already been said, Establish thyself firmly in theequilibrium of forces, in the centre of the Cross of the Elements, thatCross from whose centre the Creative Word issued in the birth of thedawning Universe. 19. Be thou therefore prompt and active as the Sylphs, but avoid frivolity andcaprice; be energetic and strong like the Salamanders, but avoid irritabilityand ferocity; be flexible and attentive to images like the Undines, butavoid idleness and changeability; be laborious and patient like theGnomes, but avoid grossness and avarice. 20. So shalt thou gradually develop the powers of thy soul, and fit thyself tocommand the Spirits of the elements. For wert thou to summon theGnomes to pander to thine avarice, thou wouldst no longer commandthem, but they would command thee. Wouldst thou abuse the pure beingsof the woods and mountains to fill thy coffers and satisfy thy hunger ofGold? Wouldst thou debase the Spirits of Living Fire to serve thy wrathand hatred? Wouldst thou violate the purity of the Souls of the Waters topander to thy lust of debauchery? Wouldst thou force the Spirits of theEvening Breeze to minister to thy folly and caprice?

The higherdegrees, from the Fifth upwards, are indeed but elaborations and explanationsof this.It is fitting, therefore, that you should be instructed in the Constitution andGovernment of our Holy Order; for by the study of its Balance you mayyourself come to apprehension of how to rule your own life. For, in TrueThings, all are but images one of another; man is but a map of the universe,and Society is but the same on a larger scale.Learn then that our Holy Order has but Three True Grades; as it is written inThe Book of the Law: The Hermit, The Lover, and the Man of Earth.It is but for convenience that these grades have been separated into ThreeTriads.The Third Triad, of which you have now reached the Middle Stage, consistsof the degrees from Minerval to Prince of Jerusalem. The Minerval degree is aPrologue to the First; the degrees subsequent to the Third but pendants to it.In this, the Man of Earth series, there are then but Three Degrees; and theseThree are One.The Man of Earth takes no share in the Government of the Order; for he isnot yet called upon to give his life to it in service; and with us Government isService, and nothing else. The Man of Earth is therefore in much theposition of the Plebian in Rome in the time of Menenius Agrippa. But thereis this marked difference; that every Man of Earth is encouraged andexpected to push on to the next stage. In order that the feelings of the generalbody may be represented, the Men of Earth choose four persons, two menand two women, from among themselves, to stand continually before the faceof the Father, the Supreme and Holy King, serving him day and night. These"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"54Ordo Templi Orientis - Oasis Orator’s Handbookpersons must not be of higher rank than your own; they must volunteer forthis service at the conclusion of this ceremony; and therefore they give uptheir own prospect of advancement in the Order for one year, that they mayserve their fellows. This is then the first lesson in our great principle, theattainment of honour through renunciation.The degree of Knights of the East and West is but a bridge between the firstand second series; but it is important, for in that grade a new pledge-formmust be signed, and the new Knight vowed to devote his life to theEstablishment of the Law of Thelema.The members of the Fifth Degree are responsible for all that concerns theSocial welfare of the Order. This grade is symbolically that of beauty andharmony; it is the natural stopping-place of the majority of men and women;for to proceed farther, as will appear, involves renunciation of the sternestkind. Here then is all joy, peace, well-being on all planes; the Sovereign PrinceRose Croix is attached equally to the higher and the lower, and forms anatural link between them. Yet let him look to it that his eyes are set on high!In this degree the Most Wise Sovereign of each chapter will appoint acommittee of four persons, two men and two women, to arrange for all socialgatherings, banquets, dances, the performance of plays, and all similarpleasures. They will also endeavour to promote harmony among the Brethrenin all possible ways, and to compose any disputes by tact and friendlinesswithout formal appeal being made to any more authoritative tribunal.The next grade, that which lies between the Fifth and Sixth Degrees, is calledthe Senate. This is the first of the governing bodies, properly speaking, andhere we begin to insist upon Renunciation. For within this body is theElectoral College of the O.T.O.The principle of popular election is a fatal folly; its results are visible in everyso-called democracy. The elected man is always the mediocrity; he is the safeman, the sound man, the man who displeases the majority less than anyother; and therefore never the genius, the man of progress and illumination.This electoral college consists of Eleven Persons in each country. It has fullcontrol of the affairs of the Men of Earth, appointing Lodge Masters at will."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"55Ordo Templi Orientis - Oasis Orator’s HandbookIt has however no authority over the Chapters of Rose Croix.Persons who wish to be appointed to this College by the Supreme and HolyKing must volunteer for the office. The appointment is for Eleven Years.Volunteers must renounce for that period all further progress in the Order.They must give evidence of first-rate ability in1. Some branch of athletics2. Some branch of learning.They must also possess a profound general knowledge of history and of theart of government, with some attention to philosophy in general.They must each live in solitude, without more than the necessary speech evento casual neighbours, serving themselves in all respects, for three monthscontinuously, once at least in every two years. The President will summonthem at the four seasons of the year, and if necessary at other times, whenthey will deliberate upon the affairs placed in their charge. All applications topass to the Fifth Degree must receive their sanction. Appeal from theirdecisions may however be made to the Supreme Council.The Sixth Degree is an executive or military body, and represents thetemporal power of the Supreme and Holy King. Each member is amenable tomilitary discipline. Singly or in concert with his comrades, each Knight isvowed to enforce the decisions of authority.The Grade of Grand Inquisitor Commander follows. Here every member hasthe right to a seat on the Grand Tribunal, which body decides all disputesand complaints which have not been composed by the Chapters of RoseCroix or the Lodge Masters. Its verdicts are without appeal, unless a memberof the Electoral College give sanction to take the case to the Areopagus of theEighth Degree. All members of the Order, even of higher grades, are subjectto the Grand Tribunal.The next grade is that of Prince of the Royal Secret. Every member of thisdegree is devoted to the Propagation of the Law in a very special manner; forthis grade is the first in which the Beginning of the Inmost Secret is declaredopenly. He will therefore, by his personal exertions, induce one hundred and"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"56Ordo Templi Orientis - Oasis Orator’s Handbookeleven persons to join the Order, before he may proceed to the SeventhDegree, except by special order from the Supreme and Holy King.The Seventh Degree is, in military language, the Great General Staff of theArmy of the Sixth Degree. From its members the Supreme and Holy Kingappoints a Supreme Grand Council.This Council is charged with the government of the whole of the SecondTriad, or Lovers. All members of the Seventh Degree travel as SovereignGrand Inspectors General of the Order, and report, on their own initiative, tothe Supreme and Most Holy King, as to the condition of all Lodges, andChapters; to the Supreme Council, on all affairs of the Second Triad; and tothe Electoral College, on those of the Third.The Eighth Degree is a Philosophical Body. Its members being fully instructedin the Principles of the Order, save in one point only, devote themselves to theunderstanding of what they have learned in their initiation. They have power toreverse the decisions of the Grand Tribunal, and to compose all conflictsbetween any of the governing bodies. And this they do upon the greatprinciples of philosophy. For it will often occur that there is contention betweentwo parties, both of whom are right from their own point of view. This is soimportant that an illustration is desirable. A man is smitten with leprosy; is itright that men should circumscribe his liberty by isolating him from his fellows?Another holds back land or some other necessity from the common use; is he tobe compelled to surrender it? Such cases of difficulty involve deep philosophicalprinciples; and the Areopagus of the Eighth Degree is charged with the duty ofresolving them in accordance with the great principles of the Order.Before the face of the Areopagus stands an independent Parliament of theGuilds. Within the Order, irrespective of grade, the members of each craft,trade, science, or profession form themselves into a Guild, make their ownlaws, and prosecute their own good, in all matters pertaining to their labourand means of livelihood. Each Guild chooses the man most eminent in it torepresent it before the Areopagus of the Eighth Degree; and all disputesbetween the various Guilds are argued before that Body, which will decideaccording to the grand principles of the Order. Its decisions pass forratification to the Sanctuary of the Gnosis, and thence to the Throne."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"57Ordo Templi Orientis - Oasis Orator’s HandbookEpopts and Pontiffs of this exalted grade are bound to live in isolation forfour consecutive months in every year, meditating the mysteries revealed tothem.The Ninth Degree–the Sanctuary of the Gnosis–is synthetic. The prime dutyof its members is to study and practise the theurgy and thaumaturgy of thegrade; but in addition they must be prepared to act as direct representativesof the Supreme and Most Holy King, radiating his light upon the wholeworld. Yet, from the nature of their initiation, they must veil their glory in acloud of darkness. They move unseen and unrecognized among the youngestof us, subtly and loftily leading us into the holy ineffable mysteries of theTrue Light.The Supreme and Most Holy King is appointed by the O.H.O. His is theultimate responsibility for all within his holy kingdom. The succession to thehigh office of O.H.O. is decided in a manner not here to be declared; butthis you may learn, O Brother Magician, that he may be chosen even fromthe grade of a Minerval. And herein lieth a most sacred Mystery.The Electoral College possesses one most singular power. Every eleven years,or in the case of a vacancy occurring, they choose two persons from theNinth Degree, who are charged with the duty of Revolution.It is the business of these persons constantly to criticise and oppose the actsof the Supreme and Most Holy King, whether or no they personally approveof them. Should he exhibit weakness, bodily, mental, or moral, they areempowered to appeal to the O.H.O. to depose him; but they, alone of all themembers of the Order, are not eligible to the Succession.The O.H.O., as the supreme authority in the Order, will act, in such anemergency, as he may see fit. He may himself be removed from office, butonly by the unanimous vote of all the members of the Tenth Degree.Of the Eleventh Degree, its powers, privileges, and qualifications, nothingwhatever is said in any grade. It has no relation to the general plan of theOrder, is inscrutable, and dwells in its own Palaces.I must now instruct you in certain important financial obligations of variousgrades."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"58Ordo Templi Orientis - Oasis Orator’s HandbookThe Electoral College of the Senate is vowed to poverty. All property,earnings, or salaries are vested in or paid over to the Grand Treasurer General.The members subsist on the charity of the Order, which is extended to themin accordance with their original rank in life.These remarks apply equally to the Supreme Grand Council, and all higherdegrees.In the Seventh Degree it is a qualification to vest some real property in theOrder; and no one is admitted to this grade without this preliminary.Those members of the Order who have given all to it must obtain the moneyfor their initiation fees and subscriptions from the Third Triad, whose honouris thus concerned in the unselfish support of those who have abandoned allfor their sakes.The Grand Treasurer General is appointed by the Supreme and Most HolyKing; he may be a member of any grade whatever; but he must, on acceptingoffice, take the vow of poverty. His authority is absolute in all financialmatters; but he is responsible to, and may be removed at will by, the Supremeand Most Holy King. He will appoint a committee to assist him and advisehim in his work; and he will usually select one person from each of thegoverning bodies of the Order.Such, brother Magician, is a brief outline of the government of the O.T.O. Itcombines monarchy with democracy; it includes aristocracy, and concealseven the seeds of revolution, by which alone progress can be effected. Thuswe balance the Triads, uniting the Three in One; thus we gather up all thethreads of human passion and interest, and weave them into an harmonioustapestry, subtly and diligently with great art, that our Order may seem anornament even to the Stars that are in the Heavens at Night. In our rainbow-coloured texture we set forth the glory of the whole Universe–See thou to it,brother Magician, that thine own thread be strong, and pure, and of a colourbrilliant in itself, yet ready to mingle in all beauty with those of thy brethren."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"59Ordo Templi Orientis - Oasis Orator’s Handbook"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"60Ordo Templi Orientis - Oasis Orator’s Handbook"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"61Abide With MeHenry Francis Lyte(See sheet music on page 69)Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;The darkness deepens; Lord, with me, abide; When other helpers fail, and comforts flee, Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
