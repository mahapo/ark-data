To All Whom it May Concern: Greeting & Health. Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) is a serious and secret religious order, pledged to the high purpose of securing the Liberty of the Individual and his or her advancement in Light, Wisdom, Understanding, Knowledge, and Power through Beauty, Courage, and Wit, on the Foundation of Universal Brotherhood. It is a body of Initiates in whose hands are concentrated the wisdom and secret knowledge of all Oriental Orders, and is the first of the Great Orders of antiquity to accept the Law of the New Aeon emanating from the A.’.A.’., which is: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law, reorganizing in accordance therewith. The letters O.T.O. represent the words Ordo Templi Orientis (Order of the Temple of the Orient, or Ancient Order of Oriental Templars). The letters O.T.O. have also a secret meaning for initiates. The aims of O.T.O. can only be understood fully by its highest initiates; but it may be said openly that it teaches Hermetic Science or Occult Knowledge, the Pure and Holy Magick of Light, the Secrets of Mystic Attainment, Yoga of all forms, Gnana Yoga, Raja Yoga, Bhakta Yoga, Tantric Yoga, and Hatha Yoga, and all other branches of the secret Wisdom of the Ancients. In its bosom repose the Great Mysteries; its brain has resolved all the problems of philosophy and life. It possesses the secret of the Stone of the Wise, of the Elixir of Immortality, and of the Universal Medicine. Moreover, it possesses a Secret capable of realizing the world-old dream of the Brotherhood of Man. Love is the law, love under will.

U.S.A. agree to binding arbitration in the Grand Tribunal, except as provided herein, and as prohibited by law. Civil lawsuits between members of the Order, except as provided herein, are forbidden. Failure to comply with this rule may entail suspension or expulsion from membership pursuant to Section 2.18.

Definition. A. All aspects of O.T.O. are religious in character, and the use of the term ‘‘ecclesiastical’’ to identify the class of membership defined in this article should not be construed to signify that other aspects of O.T.O. are not ecclesiastical or religious in character. B. The term ‘‘ecclesiastical’’ is used to signify membership in Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica within O.T.O. due to traditional historical usage. C. Ecclesiastical membership in O.T.O. does not confer Initiate, Governing or Administrative membership, or alter their exercise where they may otherwise exist. D. The terms ‘‘Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica,’’ ‘‘E.G.C.,’’ ‘‘the Gnostic Catholic Church,’’ and ‘‘the Church,’’ as used herein, are defined as the body of Ecclesiastical members of O.T.O. Ecclesiastical membership (also hereinafter referred to as ‘‘Church membership’’) in O.T.O. is equivalent to membership in Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, or the Gnostic Catholic Church, within O.T.O. Section 9.02. Subclasses of Church Membership. There are three recognized subclasses of Church membership, the Clergy (Clerical membership), the Laity (Lay membership) and Bishops in Amity (Advisory membership). The Clergy is composed of the Father (or Mother) of the Church, the Primate, the Bishops, the Priests and Priestesses, and the Deacons. The Father (or Mother) of the Church may, from time to time, designate additional subcategories within the above classes of Church membership, with such qualifications, privileges and duties as he or she may deem desirable. Section 9.03. The Father (or Mother) of the Church. The Father (or Mother) of the Church, also known as the Sovereign Patriarch or Sovereign Matriarch, is the O.H.O., regardless of the country in which the Church is established. Succession to the office of O.H.O. conveys a valid and documented apostolic succession in the Thelemic lineage of the Master Therion. All official rites and ceremonies used within E.G.C. in the U.S.A. are subject to the approval of the Father (or Mother) of the Church. The Father (or Mother) of the Church has the sole authority to suspend, revoke, and reinstate the recognition of any person’s clerical status as Bishop, Priest, Priestess or Deacon within E.G.C., and any person’s Clerical or Advisory membership in E.G.C. Section 9.04. The Primate. The Primate, or Presiding Bishop, is the National Grand Master General X°. The Primate shall in general supervise and control the affairs of E.G.C. within the U.S.A., subject to the ultimate authority of the Father (or Mother) of the Church. The Father (or Mother) of the Church may delegate, in full or in part, any or all of his or her duties and authority within E.G.C. to the Primate for exercise within the U.S.A. Such delegation does not"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"   38constitute surrender of authority, and any duties and authority so delegated may be revoked and recovered at any time. Section 9.05. The Bishops. A. The Bishops of E.G.C. are men or women who are recognized by the Father (or Mother) of the Church as possessing episcopal powers, which powers they apply in the furthering of the Law of Thelema through their ministry. Effective October 1, 1997 e.v., only Initiate members of the Magus of Light sub-degree of the Seventh Degree are eligible for recognition as Bishops within the Clerical membership of E.G.C. Bishops recognized prior to this date need not be members of the Seventh Degree, but shall be known as ‘‘Auxiliary Bishops’’ until such a time as they are initiated to the Magus of Light sub-degree of the Seventh Degree. B. Within E.G.C., the Bishops shall have such authority, and perform such duties as may be prescribed from time to time by the Primate and the Father (or Mother) of the Church. Those Bishops regularly providing public performance of the Gnostic Mass in accordance with Section 9.10, and providing religious services to their congregation on a weekly basis, may apply to the Supreme Grand Council of O.T.O. U.S.A. for recognition of ministerial status within O.T.O. U.S.A. They will then be assisted by O.T.O. U.S.A. in undertaking such legal registrations as are necessary within their State of residence to permit them to serve their congregation by performing marriages, baptisms, last rites and other religious functions. Such registrations require the review of the Supreme Grand Council of O.T.O. U.S.A. if any part of the Bishop’s authority to undertake such registration is derived from his or her Ecclesiastical membership within O.T.O. U.S.A. C. Bishops of E.G.C. who are Initiate members of O.T.O. who resign, or have resigned, their Initiate membership, automatically forfeit their Ecclesiastical membership. Section 9.06. The Priests and Priestesses. A. The Priests and Priestesses of E.G.C. are men and women who are recognized by the Father (or Mother) of the Church as possessing sacerdotal powers, which powers they apply in the furthering of the Law of Thelema through their ministry. For Priests and Priestesses to be recognized and accorded full status as such within the Clerical membership of E.G.C., they must be Initiate members of at least Knight of the East and West; and their ordination must be reported to and recorded by the Grand Secretary General. Prior to their ordination, they must have been accorded Lay membership in E.G.C. Within E.G.C., the Priests and Priestesses shall have such privileges and authority, and perform such duties as may be prescribed from time to time by the Primate and the Father (or Mother) of the Church. B. Initiate members of any degree who have been accorded Lay membership in E.G.C. may undergo a period of Novitiate training under the supervision of a Bishop, to prepare them for ordination as Priest or Priestess. Such Initiate members may participate in the celebration of the Gnostic Mass as Novice Priests and Priestesses."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"   39Section 9.07. The Deacons. A. The Deacons of E.G.C. are ordained assistants to the Priests and Priestesses. For Deacons to be recognized and accorded the status of Clerical member of E.G.C., They must be Initiate members of at least Second Degree; and their ordination must be reported to and recorded by the Grand Secretary General. Prior to their ordination, they must have been accorded Lay membership in E.G.C. Within E.G.C., the Deacons shall have such privileges and authority, and perform such duties as may be prescribed from time to time by the Primate and the Father (or Mother) of the Church. B. Initiate members of any degree who have been accorded Lay membership in E.G.C. may undergo a period of Novitiate training under the supervision of a Bishop, to prepare them for ordination as Deacons. Such Initiate members may participate in the celebration of the Gnostic Mass as Novice Deacons. Section 9.08. The Laity. Lay membership in E.G.C. is conferred by the ceremony of confirmation, which must be preceded by the ceremony of baptism. Lay membership conveys no authority or special privileges within E.G.C. The Father (or Mother) of the Church may, from time to time, modify or waive the ceremonial requirements for Lay membership in E.G.C. Section 9.09. Bishops in Amity. Bishops from affiliated or distant branches of the Gnostic Church with or without an historical connection with O.T.O. may affiliate with O.T.O. upon mutual recognition. Such Bishops, if they are not also members of the Seventh Degree, shall affiliate as Advisory members of E.G.C., and shall be known as ‘‘Bishops in Amity.’’ Section 9.10. O.T.O. Gnostic Mass. A. The Gnostic Mass or Gnostic Catholic Mass (Liber XV) is the central ritual, public and private, of E.G.C. and O.T.O., and is O.T.O.’s principal rite of religious celebration that is performed on a regular basis within its official bodies. B. The Father (or Mother) of the Church has the authority to modify the Gnostic Mass to suit special functions and occasions, to set guidelines for its proper performance, and to issue guidelines for the preparation of the sacraments. C. For performances of the Gnostic Mass to be recognized as official public religious celebrations, they must be performed in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Primate under the authority of the Father (or Mother) of the Church, and at least one of the three principal celebrating officers must be a Clerical member of E.G.C. with recognized status as Priest or Priestess under Section 9.06 or as Bishop under Section 9.05. In developing areas, this last requirement may be waived by the Father (or Mother) of the Church, or by the Primate, when the Gnostic Mass is being celebrated by Novices under the supervision of a Bishop."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"   40Article X: Subordinate Bodies Section 10.01.
