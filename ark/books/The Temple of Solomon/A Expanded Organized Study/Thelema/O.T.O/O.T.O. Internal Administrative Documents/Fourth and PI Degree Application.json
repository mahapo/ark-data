Camp with the permission of the Grand Master.The minimum time requirement between III° and IV° is one year. This requirement can only be waived bythe direct order of the Grand Master. This requires a telephone call to the Initiation Secretary, and will generallyresult in a return collect telephone call. Initiators are advised to charge an additional fee to cover their telephonecosts in seeking waivers. There is no time requirement between IV° and P.I.The same procedure is necessary for initiations scheduled so suddenly that the appropriate notification bymail is not possible, e.g. when the Application for Advancement is not mailed in time. In these cases also, anadditional fee to the Candidate is advisable in order to cover the telephone costs.Applications for Advancement should be postmarked at least 30 days prior to the proposed initiation. Thisnotification period permits verification of good report.
