Contact International Headquarters if the initiation is totake place outside the United States of America, or the candidates is not a U.S. resident.All III° initiations in the United States must be performed at, or under the auspices of, a chartered O.T.O.Lodge or Oasis. If there is no O.T.O. Lodge or Oasis in the area, III° initiations may be performed at a charteredO.T.O. Camp with the permission of the Grand Master.The minimum time requirement between II° and III° is one year. This requirement can only be waived bythe direct order of the Grand Master. This requires a telephone call to the Initiation Secretary, and will generallyresult in a return collect telephone call. Initiators are advised to charge an additional fee to cover their telephonecosts in seeking waivers.The same procedure is necessary for initiations scheduled so suddenly that the appropriate notification bymail is not possible, e.g. when the Application for Advancement is not mailed in time. In these cases also, anadditional fee to the Candidate is advisable in order to cover the telephone costs.Applications for Advancement should be postmarked at least 30 days prior to the proposed initiation. Thisnotification period permits verification of good report.An initiation report (please use Treasury-supplied reporting forms), together with all fund and financialreporting, shall be mailed within 30 days of the initiation by the initiating bodyinitiating bodyinitiating bodyinitiating bodyinitiating body directly to the Grand TreasurerGeneral at the address provided in the latest Magical Link or Agape.An Initiation Summary Report (please use the reporting form provided by the Initiation Secretary) andmembership certificates for the signature and seal of the Grand Master, shall be mailed within 30 days of theinitiation by the initiating bodyinitiating bodyinitiating bodyinitiating bodyinitiating body to the Initiation Secretary at the address provided in the latest Magical Link orAgape.NOTIFICATION OF APPROVAL OF APPLICATION:NOTIFICATION OF APPROVAL OF APPLICATION:NOTIFICATION OF APPROVAL OF APPLICATION:NOTIFICATION OF APPROVAL OF APPLICATION:NOTIFICATION OF APPROVAL OF APPLICATION: Approval of these degrees is at present tacit.
