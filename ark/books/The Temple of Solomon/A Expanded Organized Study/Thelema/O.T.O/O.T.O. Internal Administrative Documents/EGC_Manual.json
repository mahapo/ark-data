Manual1U.S. GRAND LODGE O. T. O.E. G. C. MANUALI. IntroductionThis manual sets forth the policies of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica within the U.S.Grand Lodge of Ordo Templi Orientis with respect to the celebration of the Gnostic Mass,the administration of the various Ceremonies of E.G.C., and the qualifications, powers,authorities, duties and responsibilities of the clergy of E.G.C. None of the policies setforth herein are intended to infringe on the legitimate authority of any Church outsideO.T.O.II. Structure of E.G.C. within O.T.O.A. General ConsiderationsEcclesia Gnostica Catholica (E.G.C.), or the Gnostic Catholic Church (theChurch), is the ecclesiastical aspect of Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). The GnosticCatholic Church was founded in 1907 e.v. by Jean Bricaud, Gérard Encausse and Louis-Sophrone Fugairon; the latter two having been bishops of Jules Doinel's Gnostic Church(1890) before Doinel's abdication as Patriarch. In 1908 e.v., Theodor Reuss appears tohave received episcopal consecration and primatial authority in the Gnostic CatholicChurch from Encausse, Bricaud and Fugairon in gratitude for his issuance to Encausse ofa patent for the Masonic Rites of Memphis and Mizraim. The same year, Encausse,Bricaud and Fugairon changed the name of their church to the Universal Gnostic Church,leaving Reuss exclusive authority in the Gnostic Catholic Church. As with all his otheraffiliations, Reuss incorporated the Gnostic Catholic Church into the system of O.T.O.The name \"Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica\" was coined by Aleister Crowley when hewrote the Gnostic Mass for O.T.O. in 1913 e.v. Reuss translated the Gnostic Mass intoGerman and published it in 1918 e.v., adopting it as an official rite of the Gnostic CatholicChurch; and proclaiming himself \"Sovereign Patriarch and Primate of the Gnostic CatholicChurch,\" as well as Gnostic Legate to Switzerland for Bricaud's Universal GnosticChurch. Reuss's publication of the Gnostic Mass constituted the formal acceptance of theLaw of Thelema by the Gnostic Catholic Church, and its formal declaration ofindependence from Bricaud's Universal Gnostic Church.Thus, the Gnostic Catholic Church, or Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, is aninseparable part of Ordo Templi Orientis; and the Gnostic Mass is one of the officialrituals, more specifically the central ritual, of Ordo Templi Orientis.While E.G.C. traces its historic origins to the French Gnostic revival of the turn ofthe century, which was a movement within Christianity, it has since accepted the Law ofThelema, has declared itself independent from the Christian Universal Gnostic Church and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"U.S. Grand Lodge O.T.O. E.G.C. Manual2its successors, and is no longer to be considered a Christian Church. E.G.C. does notadminister Christian Sacraments, and its ecclesiastical powers are founded on a spiritualsuccession from the Master Therion and the constituent originating assemblies of O.T.O.,rather than on the traditional Christian Apostolic Succession. The theology, doctrines andsacramental theory of E.G.C. are based on the principles of the Thelemic Religion. Itsrites and ceremonies, while eclectic in form (drawing upon the sacerdotal practices of awide variety of cultures and historical religious systems) are fundamentally Thelemic incharacter. The traditional doctrines, theology, canon law, and insignia of the RomanCatholic, Orthodox, and Jacobite Churches do not operate within E.G.C.B. MembershipThere are three recognized subclasses of Church membership, the Clergy (Clericalmembership), the Laity (Lay membership) and Bishops in Amity (Advisory membership).The Clergy is composed of the Father (or Mother) of the Church, the Primate, theBishops, the Priests and Priestesses, and the Deacons. The Father (or Mother) of theChurch may, from time to time, designate additional subcategories within the aboveclasses of Church membership, with such qualifications, privileges and duties as he or shemay deem desirable.C. The Clergy1. The Patriarchate a. The Father (or Mother) of the Church, also known as the Sovereign Patriarchor Sovereign Matriarch, is the O.H.O., regardless of the country in which the Church isestablished. For convenience, the term \"Patriarch\" is used hereinafter to mean the Father(or Mother) of the Church. All official rites and ceremonies used within E.G.C. aresubject to the approval of the Patriarch. The Patriarch has the sole authority to suspend,revoke, and reinstate the recognition of any person's clerical status as Bishop, Priest,Priestess or Deacon within E.G.C., and any person's Clerical or Advisory membership inE.G.C. The Patriarch has the authority to approve texts to be used in celebrations of theGnostic Mass by Priests and Priestesses of E.G.C., modify the Gnostic Mass to suit specialfunctions and occasions, to set guidelines for its proper performance, and to issueguidelines for the preparation of the eucharistic elements.b. At this time, the Patriarch is Frater Superior Hymenaeus Beta, Caliph andActing O.H.O. of O.T.O."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"U.S. Grand Lodge O.T.O. E.G.C. Manual32. The Primacya. The Primate, or Presiding Bishop, is the National Grand Master General Xº.The Primate shall in general supervise and control the affairs of E.G.C. within the U.S.A.,subject to the ultimate authority of the Patriarch. The Patriarch may delegate, in full or inpart, any or all of his or her duties and authority within E.G.C. to the Primate for exercisewithin the U.S.A. Such delegation does not constitute surrender of authority, and anyduties and authority so delegated may be revoked and recovered at any time.b. At this time, the Primate of E.G.C. within the U.S.A. is Sabazius Xº, NationalGrand Master General of the U.S. Grand Lodge of O.T.O. Frater Superior HymenaeusBeta has delegated, in full, his duties and authority within E.G.C. to Sabazius Xº forexercise within the U.S.A. The actions and decisions of the Primate are subject tomodification or reversal by the Patriarch upon appeal by any Bishop within the U.S.A.3. The Episcopatea. The Bishops of E.G.C. are men or women who are recognized by the Patriarchas possessing episcopal powers, which powers they apply in the furthering of the Law ofThelema through their ministry. Effective October 1, 1991 e.v., only Initiate members ofthe Theoreticus sub-degree of Seventh Degree in good standing are eligible forrecognition as Bishops within the Clerical membership of E.G.C. Bishops in goodstanding recognized prior to this date need not be members of the Seventh Degree, butshall be known as \"Auxiliary Bishops\" until such a time as they are initiated to theTheoreticus sub-degree of the Seventh Degree.b. Within E.G.C., the Bishops shall have such authority, and perform such dutiesas may be prescribed from time to time by the Primate and the Patriarch.At this time, Bishops have the power and authority within E.G.C. to celebrate theGnostic Mass; to ordain Priests, Priestesses and Deacons of E.G.C.; and to performbaptisms, confirmations, marriages and last rites, in accordance with local laws.The term \"Bishop\" as used herein shall mean a Bishop who possesses theTheoreticus sub-degree of VIIº unless the term is preceded by the word \"Auxiliary\" orfollowed by the words \"in Amity.\" Auxiliary Bishops of E.G.C. have all the privileges andauthority of the E.G.C. Priesthood, along with those additional privileges and authorityspecified herein for Auxiliary Bishops, and those conferred upon them individually by thePrimate or the Patriarch.c. Bishops and Auxiliary Bishops of E.G.C. have the responsibility of serving asofficial representatives of E.G.C. within O.T.O. Therefore, any public celebration of theGnostic Mass which involves the participation of a recognized Bishop or Auxiliary Bishopof E.G.C. as an officer is by definition an official O.T.O. event and is subject to thepolicies of O.T.O. regarding official O.T.O. events.d. The term \"Bishop\" does not carry the same meaning within E.G.C. as it does inChristian Churches or in the so-called \"Wandering Bishops\" tradition. Possession of a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"U.S. Grand Lodge O.T.O. E.G.C. Manual4valid and documented Apostolic Succession does not make one a Bishop of E.G.C.;neither is a Christian Apostolic Succession necessary to the Bishops of E.G.C. e. Gnostic Bishops of the Doinel Succession assume a Mystic Name prefaced bythe Greek letter \"T\" or \"Tau\" upon their consecration. Bishops and Auxiliary Bishops ofE.G.C. who wish to emphasize this part of their spiritual heritage may, at their option,follow this tradition. However, the Double Tau is reserved for use by the Patriarch andthe Primate.4. The Priesthooda. The Priesthood of E.G.C. includes both Priests and Priestesses. The Priestsand Priestesses of E.G.C. are men and women, respectively, who are recognized by thePatriarch as possessing sacerdotal powers, which powers they apply in the furthering ofthe Law of Thelema through their ministry. For Priests and Priestesses to be recognizedand accorded full status as such within the Clerical membership of E.G.C., they must beInitiate members in good standing of at least Knight of the East and West; and theirordination must be reported to and recorded by the Grand Secretary General and theEcclesiastical Secretary. Prior to their ordination, they must have been accorded Laymembership in E.G.C. With the permission of the Primate, they may, prior to their formalordination, take on limited duties and authority of the Priesthood under the supervision ofa Bishop.b. Within E.G.C., the Priests and Priestesses shall have such privileges andauthority, and perform such duties as may be prescribed from time to time by the Primateand the Patriarch.Priests and Priestesses have the Sacerdotal power and authority to celebrate theGnostic Mass as representatives of E.G.C. within O.T.O. A Bishop may also delegate tothem the authority to ordain Deacons and perform baptisms, confirmations and last rites;and, in certain cases, to perform weddings. Priests and Priestesses are expected tocoordinate their work with a Bishop, with whom they should communicate frequently.c. Priests and Priestesses of E.G.C. have the responsibility of serving as officialrepresentatives of E.G.C. within O.T.O. Therefore, any public celebration of the GnosticMass which involves the participation of a recognized Priest or Priestess of E.G.C. as anofficer is by definition an official O.T.O. event and is subject to the policies of O.T.O.regarding official O.T.O. events.5. The Diaconatea. The Deacons of E.G.C. are ordained assistants to the Priests and Priestesses.For Deacons to be recognized and accorded the status of Clerical member of E.G.C., theymust be Initiate members in good standing of at least Second Degree; and their ordinationmust be reported to and recorded by the Grand Secretary General and the EcclesiasticalSecretary. Prior to their ordination, they must have been accorded Lay membership inE.G.C."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"U.S. Grand Lodge O.T.O. E.G.C. Manual5b. Within E.G.C., the Deacons shall have such privileges and authority, andperform such duties as may be prescribed from time to time by the Primate and thePatriarch.At this time, Deacons have the power and authority only to assist recognizedPriests and Priestesses of E.G.C. in the performance of their duties. They are notconsidered as official representatives of E.G.C.6. The Novitiatea. Initiate members of any degree who have been accorded Lay membership inE.G.C. may undergo a period of Novitiate training under the supervision of a Bishop, toprepare them for ordination as Priest, Priestess or Deacon. Such Initiate members mayparticipate in the celebration of the Gnostic Mass as Novice Priests, Priestesses andDeacons.b. Novice status is not formally recognized by the Order, and is not included in theOrder's records.7. Recognition of OrdinationTo apply for official recognition, ordained Priests, Priestesses and Deacons mustwrite to the Grand Secretary General and the Ecclesiastical Secretary and provide thefollowing information:a. Full Civil Name and any Magical Names or Mottoesb. Mailing Addressc. Telephone Numberd. Membership Class for which recognition is requested (i.e. Priest, Priestess orDeacon)e. Name and E.G.C. Rank of the person who administered the ordinationf. Date of the ordinationg. Signature of the applicanth. Signature of the person who administered the ordination.8. Recognition of Ministerial StatusThose Bishops and Auxiliary Bishops regularly providing public performance ofthe Gnostic Mass in accordance with O.T.O. policies, and providing religious services totheir congregation on a weekly basis, may apply to the Supreme Grand Council of O.T.O.U.S.A. for recognition of ministerial status within O.T.O. They will then be assisted byO.T.O. U.S.A. in undertaking such legal registrations as are necessary within their State ofresidence to permit them to serve their congregation by performing marriages, baptisms,last rites and other religious functions. Such registrations require the review of theSupreme Grand Council of O.T.O. U.S.A. if any part of the Bishop's authority to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"U.S. Grand Lodge O.T.O. E.G.C. Manual6undertake such registration is derived from his or her Ecclesiastical membership withinO.T.O.9. Withdrawal of Recognition and AuthorityClerical authority and recognition of Ministerial Status within E.G.C. can berevoked for cause by the Patriarch at any time, and is automatically lost upon resignation,suspension or expulsion from O.T.O., or lapse of active membership status in O.T.O.D. The Laitya. Lay Membership in E.G.C. is conferred by the ceremony of confirmation, whichmust be preceded by the ceremony of baptism. Lay Membership conveys no authority orspecial privileges within E.G.C. The Patriarch may, from time to time, modify or waivethe ceremonial requirements for Lay membership in E.G.C.b. Baptism is open to any person of at least the age of 11 years, but does not, initself, confer Lay Membership. Confirmation is open to any person who has been baptizedand who has attained the age of puberty. Baptism and/or confirmation for any person lessthan 18 years of age requires the prior written consent of a parent or legal guardian.Baptism and confirmation are public ceremonies.E. Bishops in Amitya. Bishops from affiliated or distant branches of the Gnostic Church with orwithout an historical connection with O.T.O. may affiliate with O.T.O. upon mutualrecognition. Such Bishops shall affiliate as Advisory members of E.G.C., and shall beknown as \"Bishops in Amity.\"b. Advisory membership in E.G.C. confers no clerical authority within E.G.C.III. CeremoniesA. The Gnostic Mass1. General ConsiderationsAleister Crowley wrote Liber XV in 1913 in Moscow, the year after hisappointment by Theodor Reuss as the Xº Head of the British Section of O.T.O.According to W. B. Crow in A History of Magic, Witchcraft and Occultism (AquarianPress, London 1968), Crowley wrote it \"under the influence of the Liturgy of St. Basil ofthe Russian Church.\" Crowley published the Gnostic Mass three times during his life: in1918 in The International, in 1919 in The Equinox, Volume III, No. 1 (the \"BlueEquinox\"), and in 1929 in Appendix VI of Magick in Theory and Practice. Theodor"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"U.S. Grand Lodge O.T.O. E.G.C. Manual7Reuss published a German variant in 1918. It was first publicly celebrated on Sunday,March 19, 1933 e.v. by Wilfred T. Smith and Regina Kahl in Hollywood, California.Crowley writes in Chapter 73 of his Confessions:\"During this period [The summer of 1913 e.v. - Ed.] the full interpretation of the centralmystery of freemasonry became clear in consciousness, and I expressed it in dramaticform in `The Ship'. The lyrical climax is in some respects my supreme achievement ininvocation; in fact, the chorus beginning:Thou who art I beyond all I am...seemed to me worthy to be introduced as the anthem into the Ritual of the GnosticCatholic Church, which, later in the year, I prepared for the use of the O.T.O., thecentral ceremony of its public and private celebration, corresponding to the Mass of theRoman Catholic Church.\"2. Public and Private Celebrationa. A public celebration of the Gnostic Mass is one which is open to members ofthe public; or which is noticed in any official O.T.O. publication under the name \"GnosticMass,\" \"Gnostic Catholic Mass,\" \"Liber XV,\" or equivalent names. A private celebrationof the Gnostic Mass is one at which the individual participants are all initiate members ofO.T.O. of at least 0ø. Private celebrations of the Gnostic Mass may be held for initiates ofhigher degrees as well.b. Public celebrations of the Gnostic Mass shall be performed in accordance withthe guidelines contained herein and with any other guidelines issued by the Primate underthe authority of the Patriarch; and at least one of the three principal celebrating officersmust be a Clerical member of E.G.C. with recognized status as Priest, Priestess, Bishop,or Auxiliary Bishop. In developing areas, this last requirement may be waived by thePrimate or the Patriarch when the Gnostic Mass is being celebrated by Novices under thesupervision of a Bishop.c. Public celebrations of the Gnostic Mass are to be held to the highest standardsof performance and fidelity to the approved texts of Liber XV (listed below). The officersof the Mass should know their parts by heart and should not use scripts; with theexception that the Deacon may use a script while intoning the collects if necessary.d. The text of Liber XV, including the Collects, is not to be added to or modifiedwithout the express permission of the current Patriarch.e. Passages quoted from Liber CCXX in Liber XV may be revised to conform tothe original wording of Liber CCXX; i.e., \"children of the Prophet\" may be changed to\"child of the Prophet.\"f. Additional names shall not be added to the List of Saints in the Fifth Collect, orelsewhere in the Gnostic Mass, without the express permission of the Patriarch. Bishopsmay petition the Primate to recommend to the Patriarch the addition of a name to the listof Saints. The names Karl Johannes Germer and Grady Louis McMurtry may optionallybe added to the list of Saints in any celebration of the Gnostic Mass.g. All Anthems other than that included in Liber XV must be approved in advanceby the Patriarch prior to use in a public celebration of the Gnostic Mass."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"U.S. Grand Lodge O.T.O. E.G.C. Manual8h. For performance purposes in public celebrations of the Gnostic Mass, the stagedirections and descriptions of costuming and temple furniture given in the text of LiberXV are to be interpreted in a straightforward manner, not as metaphor or euphemism.i. Interpretations of Liber XV by Auxiliary Bishops, Priests, Priestesses andDeacons for public celebrations of the Gnostic Mass are subject to review andmodification by the Bishops. The decisions of a Bishop on interpretation may be appealedto the Primate.j. Local economic and spatial constraints may prevent the full implementation ofthe provisions in Liber XV regarding temple furniture and costuming. However, theseprovisions should be implemented as best as possible; and improvements should continueto be made as additional resources become available.k. For public celebrations of the Gnostic Mass, the role of Priest shall be filled bya man, and the role of Priestess shall be filled by a woman.l. The roles of the two \"Children\" in Liber XV should be filled whenever possiblefor public celebrations of the Gnostic Mass. These roles may be filled by any twoindividuals who have been baptized in E.G.C., including adults. The Children serve theCakes of Light and goblets of wine to the individual communicants. Where the roles ofthe Children cannot be filled in a public celebration of the Gnostic Mass, the Deaconshould serve the Cakes of Light and the goblets of wine to the individual communicants.m. Liber XV may be modified for Requiem Masses by including a brief mention ofthe deceased at the eleventh Collect. n. Any celebration of the Gnostic Mass which is held at, or is sponsored by, anofficial O.T.O. Local Body is, by definition, an official E.G.C. and O.T.O. event, and issubject to the policies set forth herein and to the policies of O.T.O. regarding officialO.T.O. events regarding drugs, firearms, etc. The Master of the Local Body is responsiblefor enforcing these policies.3.
