[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" Paradoxos Alpha R+C Tattoo Symbolism The original basis for the design is Martin Luther’s seal (at left), a design that was created during or just before the first heyday of Rosicrucianism. Luther’s seal, subsequently adopted as a symbol of the Protestant church he founded, shows a Latin cross within a red heart, inside a white rose of five petals. (Paradoxos Alpha was subjected to infant baptism in a Lutheran church of Protestant Christianity, where he went on to be confirmed, and to serve actively in various capacities until leaving his parents’ household. He was the “youth representative” on the church council, and even once preached a fairly incompetent, but soundly heretical, church sermon to that congregation.) The tattoo design differs from its Lutheran antecedent on several points. Aesthetically, it incorporates traditional tattoo elements, such as more naturalistic rose petals (as opposed to the severely geometrical, heraldic style), a couple of “sprays” from the bloom, and more shading and dimensionality to the heart. The tattoo rose has seven petals, rather than five. Thus it alludes to the seven rungs of the ladder, the seven planets, the seven letters of BABALON, and other important septenaries. The cross is a Saint Peter’s cross of gold, with two intersecting words in Hebrew. Counting the shared letter once, there are seven letters. Transliterated (but still reading the lateral word from right to left), it is: A  L  H N I A M The St. Peter’s cross is a traditional Christian symbol; St. Peter (the “stone,” who is sometimes identified with Simon Magus) was said to have been crucified head-down. Compare the posture of the MWS in the Black Room during the 33 years and the obligation. Note that the basis of the cross (i.e. the bottom letter) is mem, the Hanged Man on the Cross of Suffering. The Hebrew phrase ain elohim appears most conspicuously in Psalm 53, which is a duplicate or twin of Psalm 14. (Verse 1: “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no god.”) The twinning of the Psalm suits the dual nature of Heru-ra-ha, and the idea of the initiate as the twin of his profane identity (see chapter 56 of The Book of Lies). It also alludes to the astrological nativity of Paradoxos Alpha, with the sun in Gemini at the midheaven. Both Hebrew words begin with aleph, the Fool. “Fool” is from the Latin follis, bellows, from the Greek phallos. The aleph is the only duplicated letter in the figure. The yod at the point of intersection represents the Secret Seed. It is the germinal character of all other Hebrew letters. It is also the initial of YHWH, having the value of 10, and therefore summing the emanations. In English transliteration, it is a pun on the first-person pronoun in the nominative case. “I am alone. There is no god where I am.” The letters of the divine name ALHIM (elohim) are attributable to the five elements. See chapter 86 of Liber CCCXXXIII, in which this formula is converted to NIHIL (Latin for ain)."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD. –Leviticus XIX:28 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. –Deuteronymy XXXII:39 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. –Psalms XIV:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. –Psalms LIII:1 And said in their heart, that there is no God; yea, and that knowing they must die. –IV Ezra 8:58 The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. –Isaiah XXXV:1 I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. –Canticles II:1 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. –Matthew X:38 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. –Exodus XXIII:9 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. –Matthew XII:35 I am alone.
