We don't necessarily have to wait until we have 11 Senators.A.C.: I, I would.J.W.: It's up to Grady if he wants the criticism to ... be officially sanctioned!A.C.: I would because the two 9ths, I would wait until 11 senators because the two 9s they choose are ineligible to the succession and that's fucking important! So I would keep it by the letter of the fucking law that thing is not capable, the Electoral College is not capable of doing that until there are 11 of them and it's fully implemented.B.B.: Well it's actually not the letter of the law as is stated there.J.W.: Yea.B.B.: That would be an interpretation and uh um and a political expediency of some sort, um. A.C.: It says it consists of 11 persons.B.B.: Sure but we're not going to have an electoral college called an electoral college, and then see, no, the fact is ...J.W.: This, this is ...B.B.: The Electoral College are are, they're 5th Degrees, there are going to be 9th Degrees that are not going to be on the Electoral College ...A.C.: Right, right ...

We could, us, there could be anonymous profiles.A.C.: Yes, that would be the way to insure, that would be the way to ensure integrity in the decision, but that's something for them to work out.J.W.: But it may not, the integrity is with a position that we're creating here out of the air, and I don't think it's something, you know, that needs to 100% to be decided uh, at this instant. In other words its either the whole Lovers Triad or the Electoral College or, or anonymous profiles,A.C.: That has to be discussed.J.W.: I meant that's, that's really got to be discussed and not decided tonight. The, the stuff that we have to decide tonight is ...B.B.: Well this is a particularly touchy one, because this is, this could be one of the most politically explosive, uh, sections of the document.M.K.: That's right.J.W.: So far we don't have to worry about it because, um, we have um ...B.B.: But I think we should have a little um, uh, eh, yea, I uh, I think we should get off on the right foot on it because see this, if we get this thing through its going to be ratified um, in a consensus ah, like with commentary I mean, ya know, with like um, with like recommendations for implementation uh, and if this goes through without a recommendation for its implica, implementation as a form of guidance then the whole this whole uh section is open to you know, in other words, we've managed to obviate uh politicking in the gross kind for most of the other sections I think, and its going to, I think a lot of it's going to wind up here you know!

And uh, and he wanted, and uh, what he was saying, I wrote back and said well, I can always appoint you Sovereign Grand Inspector General just like Crowley appointed me and so forth, and this basically came down to a big laugh.

Because, unless you looked scruffy, looked like you hadn't bothered to shave too well, in other words if you were paying too much attention to Malkuth, you weren't operating in this realm this exalted realm, because therefore you had the cult of the dirty fingernail you see.J.W.: laughsG.M.: Well, this is uh, (laughing) what we're getting to, and that of course is an unreal interpretation of a very real thing, which is to say , uh, like the University of California had just chosen for a new president of the entire system and the guy's from the University of Utah. Now where the fuck is Utah?

(Laughter) You know, and then it'll recoverG.M.: yea ...B.B.: who knows, you know, but, no, we're just thinking ahead, I don't know. Um ... (laughs)G.M.: Oooh, yea! Yea, yea, yea.R.G.: Up to our buttholes in buttholes, huh?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"B.B.: Well,G.M.: Yea, well, um, I don't know about future people in my position, but I got a full dose of that in the Army in Korea. At that time, I was a Captain in battalion level and operating right straight up against the regular army because regular army became, uh, started telling them I was a lieutenant colonel and all that, you see. And, uh, I made an observation under extremely trying circumstances that there is something even a West Point graduate in 30 years of peacetime army there is something that happens to his brain, it calcifies, you see, and this is this butthole sort of thing. (Chuckles) In other words, my current thinking is that we are so revolutionary its going to be a little difficult for us to, be, uh, graduate somebody to that level who's a butthole because just like right now for example, yea, I'm here, yea, everybody knows I knew Crowley, but if I were competent for the job, I wouldn't be holding it either! (Chuckles)(J.W. laughs)G.M.: you see what I mean.B.B.: I see what you mean.G.M.: And so the person who's going to fulfill that position is obviously going to have to have his savvy together to be intelligent enough to do it. The job, or he wouldn't be a candidate to begin with. So uh, when we get to that, why, we're, that leaves us uh, with future possibilities, but at least I am very much aware that beaura, bureaucratization can set in and I think that that's also one of your basic problems here is that you see Heidrick as a bureaucracy, and the ah, the corporation as a ah, machine, not responsive to the heart and Will of the Order as a magickal group. Now, is that a summary?J.W.: In the past ...B.B.: That's a good summary.(Laughter by all)R.G.: Also ...(Mumbles by several)G.M.: Also, that's what I'm getting at, also, I'm saying that this is, we're coming now to as it were to a point of decision, decision points in time are very important, but for me it's been every decade more or less. It, ah, there were certain times when I had to be in a certain place and make the right decision and act, and its taken 10 years in between with free time, but I forgot to make a fortune, go to South America, but be at the next decision point at that time ...(AC laughs)G.M.: and in condition, not only just alive ...(Laughter by all)G.M.: but to make the decision because otherwise the whole thing doesn't work, you see. And that's where we are in terms of the Organization. Because now, Crowley, McMurtry, yous guys, in other words at this point the Order has now come to the point where it can start, in that sense, reach this mass intelligence of where everybody is thinking along lines. There's, individualism is rampant as is obvious (laughs) but...if you're on the same vibration, it's like a bunch of bees in a, in a hive, and they ma y have a bunch of individual bees, but everybody knows the vibration of the hive. And that sort of thing. I kept trying over seven years to explain to Shirene, well, if you were a Thelemite you would understand why we do things like that, you know. (Chuckles) And those people who aren't Thelemites, then, it's uh, there's nothing uh, nobody is forcing them, its just that they keep zeroing in on this vibration of the Book of the Law, and the (Torah?) and that sort of thing, until you have this group of people who have separated themselves like cream from milk. And they are floating like those kids in Salt Lake City. I saw it so beautifully first there, then I hadn't seen it before, but he, this is a test tube case, as it"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" were, (chuckles) here's Salt Lake City, this entire flat Mormon universe, and here's this little happy bunch of honey bees floating around the O.T.O. completely invisible, you know.

(chuckles)(Laughter by all)G.M.: Fomenting revolution which is exactly what they were saying because they, the Mormon prophets were dumb enough to, eh, they have this prophesy you know, that's one of these days Salt Lake City will become Babalon and all good Mormons will go back to Missouli Missouri,(Laughter by all)G.M.: And they're right on the front lines! And you god damned right, and we are Babalon, and we're here and that's a lot of prime property that's going to be let go! (drowned by laughter)(More laughter)G.M.: Now you see what I mean!A.C.: We'll take that Disneyland-like cathedral over there!(Laughter by all)G.M.: Yea, right! So, uh, yea, this, the forefront of the Revolution sort of thing is sort of built into the O.T.O. in that sense, you can't be, ah, let me put it this way, you can't be a Thelemite in this society without ah having a trace of the outlaw in you, because you've got to first of all rebel against Christianity, and its moral dogmas as it were, before you can consider being a Thelemite to begin with, unless you pick up the Book of the Law and just get turned on click automatically. (Chuckles) Which also happens.B.B.: Yea.G.M. But, the spirit of revolution, ah, just being Thelemites just to begin with, you know, is so built in that, I won't say it's difficult, its difficult for me to conceive of only in the sense that I don't see bureaucracy um, (inaudible)... I site as proof the present meeting.J.W.: You're going to be in a very, ah, in a very peculiar position as O.H.O. and Supreme and Holy King, because um,(Chuckles)B.B.: If they want to depose you,M.K.: You're a little bit like Kruschev,(Several speak at once)B.B.: If the Revolutionaries decide that you're unfit for duty, for some reason, and they want to depose you, they have to appeal to you!(All laugh)G.M.: Crowley had a way of looking at it like that! (Laughter)B.B.: Yea.J.W.: On the other hand, if you felt like it, just as, as on the hell of it, you could appoint a Supreme and Most Holy King for um, um, the United States.G.M.: I'm looking forward to that, and uh, in the sense that ...J.W.: And ah ...G.M.: There ah, there was a delicate um, judgmental balance there, I'm looking forward, see, one reason for this expansion, the allowing the Thelemic current to recognize itself in various countries, but practically from an organizational point of view, looking at it as Constitutionalists to ah, fulfill this function we must have 10th Degrees. National heads.J.W.: (laughs) I was just thinking, boy, if we, (laughs)B.B.: Uh oh!J.W.: Can we take this off the record for a sec? But ah ...

And not only in terms of uh, setting down a uh structure rationally conceived, but also that will go over with the people concerned. Now for example, this happened once before very early on, we've had a lot of, uh, little ah, systems, there at Grand Lodge. This was back within the first two years. Something happened. And uh, so, the consensus of opinion isn't necessary to mention names, ah, was that uh, well Heidrick is doing the wrong thing here, and should do so and so, but, as see, basically, disapproved of it and they wanted to do so and so because they disapproved of it. I knew this was dynamite, and so I came to it like a theoretical question, and he just froze, for a second, and he said, rather skillfully, well, when that happens, I'll just go someplace else. And you have to remember, that his money, and ah his expertise, and his knowledge, his fantastic talent, is all volunteer, now, if we don't want Heidrick in the Order, we can treat him one way, and if we want him in the Order we can treat him another. Because he has, all he has to do is pick up his marbles, shit, he's got the Universe to play with. He values his position, I think, I think of him as very loyal, ah person, to me personally as well as to the Order. But basically what he's loyal to is, loyal to is Crowleyan Thelema. And this is ah, he was the very first one to recognize the lineage aspect as far as the Berkeley people were concerned. That is is the only. This is the guy that Crowley designated therefore its Go.
