This apartment building is residence to MichaelKramer, Richard \"Gurney\" Gernon, and the site of the Kephra ChapterO.T.O. Temple. The conversation takes place in a room appropriatelynicknamed \"the War Room\", just feet from the entrance to the Temple.Present in the room is Grady Louis McMurtry, Bill Breeze, JamesWasserman, Richard Gernon, Michael Kramer, and one other member of TheSanctuary Of The Gnosis.RG: It says here...uh..the only reference that we've been able to find is that he is chosen in a manner not here to be declared.GM: hmmJW: Right.RG: That's all that is known.BB: No no, that's not all that is known,GM: (chuckles)BB: because its well known that Crowley defined in that Caliphate letter in question-RG: Oh well, I mean from this-BB: Do you still have them up here? You know, the Caliphate letterRG: YesBB: is like real clear- (aside to JW) have you talked about that with him?JW: WellUN: And silence is consent-JW: not...not at...we're going on someth...right now we're discussing um...an old..ah issue between um..Grady and I , and Gurney and um and it concerns the uh...BB: Order Of Thelemites?JW: Order Of Thelemites.RG: Yeah, and the whole concept of a an election for OHOJW: YeahBB: No...doesn't occur.XX: someone coughsBB: You see its actually Gerald Yorke's-GM: Again, that was an emergency measure taken by Crowley because the Order was not set up at that point to elect an OHO because this again is seminal in my thinking that the reason Crowley took that expediency was because he didn't have a multinational body.BB: No. No.GM: And thats what we're working back toward-BB: No. Its as simple as thisGM: the multinational body-BB: Its as simple as this...somebody made a boo boo and we can prove it.GM: (sounding uncertain) umBB: its very simple to proveUN: Crowley allowed for the contingency to-BB: Hold on. Hold on. This is like such a story! Its incredible.GM: okay...BB: There is a document...there are three orders that we know of theres the OTO...ok? Then there's uh...

There is a document...ok.. the OHO which I was talking about umm is in fact appointed after Crowley's death, there was not supposed to be an election for OHO...Germer was it. Ok? And Crowley..GM: uhhhh Germer was Frater Superior until such time as an OHO was declared ... as I understood it.BB: No, but thats based on a letter you got that's fowarded through New York from Gerald Yorke..I can go get the letter out..but you know what it says..GM: Maybe...but go ahead, go ahead...I don't have to-XX: Several people try to talk:RG: This ..This is the essential point of itUN: Listen to this part...JW: This is the one about the...BB: This is the kicker...UN: (to others) Let Billy do the presentation.BB: This is the kicker... its very funny ...that letter had a quote saying that within such and such a period of time Frater Saturnus must call an election to uh... of all ranking AA members over the grade of...uh..JW: ZelatorBB: Zelator umm to determine who will be the new head. Um...now..that is a quote from the Constitution of The Order Of Thelemites...that was taken bodily out of that document by Yorke sent through New York and Germer and fowarded on to you.GM: uh-huhBB: nowhere on it did it say Order Of Thelemites, its taken completely out of context and its been the source of considerable confusion for 35 years (laughing). Because it is specifically for that order...it has nothing to do with the OTO. Nothing at all.RG: (slowly) He was supposed to hold an election to decide the head of the Order Of ThelemitesBB: Thats what the document...RG: Seeing as how if you see the whole document every name has been scratched off. He did not hold that election because there was no one to vote.GM: Well Germer had \"German\" logic yeah..RG: Well it was obvious Crowley through his life had scratched voting members names off. it wasGM: Welll uh I got you, I got you, but it was a...this has been the crux of-RG: until there was no one left (smiling is if a punch line)XX: (someone laughing)GM: of-RG: except Germer!XX: (laughing stops)GM: Dejury versus defacto you see...uhh we....when Karl did not-BB: No!

(trying to get their attention) But lets review a little history here real fast. Ok-fine.XX: OkGM: When Karl.... and I'm talking about a little antedeluvian history of 47-49....that sort of thing...when it became obvious, after he had notified us that this was going to happen, and my memory of it is that within that year he simply let us know that he was now OHO and I remember talking and writing to Mildred and Ray and to others and saying you know like...\"What Happened?\" But we were stuck with the thing. And the \"thing\" was this: Karl regardless of how you looked at it, was Frater Superior of the Order, Now...this then in my opinion is the basis of Karl's later paranoia...fueled by Sasha... in terms of paranoia about my wanting to su.. to replace... that I was putting a revolt against Germer because as though he had seen the logic that he was the only member of the Order and therefore he did not have to call a convocation...JW: Not the OTOGM: in our minds that made him defacto! But there was always a question of dejury.BB: Defacto what.GM: Defacto OHO.BB: No No he was the only member of the Order Of Thelemites.GM: But we're talking about the OTO.RG: Ok!JW: He was...he wasGM: He was the Frater Superior of the OTO regardless of whatever-MK: OHO as expressed...as expressed in the constitution is a dejure term.GM: but I mean....MK: The defacto head is anyone actually in charge of whats going on.GM: No no no no no!BB: But you see the point here is getting confused again...GM: There is defacto and then there is by law. A dictator is defacto but operate a constitution is by law.JW: Right.GM: And thats what we are talking about!BB: But I'm telling you in all honesty Grady...GM: uh-huhBB: that you are constitutionally...RG: DejuryBB: Constitutionally, dejury OHO.GM: (offhandedly, quickly brushing it aside) Right.Thank you. But we're talking about-XX: (all others laugh at this \"matter of fact\" acceptance)GM: we're talking about Karl and psychologyBB: umhmGM: because just as when I gave umm Jerry Cornielius a lot of karma..XX: someone coughsGM: a seventh degree thinking I was rewarding him and showing him that, you know, that he was appreciated the psychology was then he wanted to know when he got \"paid\"- when he got the next raise and so he voluntarily took the eighth degree much against my advice. Now the same thing happened here with Germer, uh, having declared himself OHO there was nothing anybody could do about it but the logic of it or the psychology of it was that he was always antsy about ...about people beneath him and I think one reason why he didn't initiate because he didn't want any competition and as long as he was the only one around, he was the only one who could do anything, but of course that killed the Order. Regardless of the Order Of Thelemites, in the OTO there was no one to replace him at that time. I couldn't. I was busy getting my education."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"RG: Right. Right.GM: Nobody...I say then I say Jack died in 52 but he wasn't involved. In that sense.

He was in a sense dictatorial...but uh..in that sense so that um...this sort of thing has been something on my mind, for forty fucken years... and I-XX: But...GM: Pardon me?...but in any case, I'm not argueing with your logic, I'm merely suggesting to you that logic and human emotions have be both taken in together into consideration when dealing with subjects of this nature (starts tapping the table in emphasis of his point) I KNOW that your logic is right BUT, HOW will this effect the people involved because THAT there... how they react will effect... will effect the Order ...G.M.: So we've got this three billiard shot going.M.K.: Once again it would effect the Order magickally. The O.H.O. is being treated in the same way as the Sanctuary of the Gnosis.G.M.: Good.J.W.: The idea is is further that we, either we know that Germer may have been appointed as O.H.O. by Crowley and we may not have known about it or there may have been no O.H.O. for a period of time.R.G.: But doesn't he say in the Caliphate letter, he says that Germer is the O.H.O.A.C.: That Caliphate letter seems to indicate very clearly that the Caliph is the O.H.O.J.W.: The caliph and the O.H.O. and that he was looking beyond Germer to you.R.G.: Right.B.B. Right, yea, in other words your case,J.W.: As his successor.B.B.: Your case as Caliph is based on the letters is quite natural and on your relationship to Crowley.G.M.: Yea.B.B.: Ah however Germer's case is always, is also ah beautifully laid out in the letters because he says that he is of course is natural first CaliphG.M.: MhmB.B.: And of course will be the O.H.O. and all that. And like that's laid out. And it seems, I feel that Germer really was the O.H.O. um, and that you are in the same sense really the O.H.O.G.M. Mhmm B.B.: And that the O.H.O. is not an elected office at all and that when it says in the Constitution that an O.H.O. is created in a manner not here to be declared, that it's by appointment.

Yes.A.C.: 10 degrees can remove the O.H.O. by a unanimous vote.R.G.: But it doesn't say that they,A.C.: But they don't appoint him.R.G.: They can only vote him out.(Pause)B.B.: I have a good question though, if they vote him out, how do you get a new one?(Laughter)J.W.: Ha Ha!M.K.: There's the point ...M.K.: We have, we have in the Constit...G.M.: Who appoints him?

However Crowley did think in a certain way and he might have seen the, ah, Order of Thelemites as a link between the A.·.A.', and O.T.O. in some certain sense.J.W.: Right!

It would be a good question for Yorke before Yorke di.. goes away.R.G.: What we do know is, is so obvious though, what we do know is what's stated in the Caliphate letters which is that the Caliph is the O.H.O.

Brrrrrrrrr (laughs) god.B.B.: No, but this is very interesting. Um, ok, Germer was the only member on the list ah, on the Order of Thelemites charter.
