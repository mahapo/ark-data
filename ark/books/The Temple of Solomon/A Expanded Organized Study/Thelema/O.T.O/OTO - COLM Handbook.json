U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook1O. T. O.U. S. CAMP, OASIS AND LODGE MASTER'S HANDBOOKI. IntroductionThis handbook was written to assist Masters of O.T.O. Camps, Oases and Lodgesin the United States, in dealing with the often daunting task of the administration of theirO.T.O. Local Bodies. This handbook is for general use; it does not supply informationregarding the conduct of initiation rituals or E.G.C. rituals, or regarding issues unique tothe administration of Lodges. Questions on the initiation rituals are addressed in theAnnotated Ritual Manual available to Chartered Initiators. Questions on the GnosticMass and other E.G.C. rituals are addressed in Article IX of the Bylaws of O.T.O. U.S.A.and in the U.S. E.G.C. Manual. The more complex questions on administering Lodges, aswell as any other questions we have not addressed here or in the Annotated Rituals,should be handled by consulting a Grand Lodge Officer.The contents of this handbook may be viewed by any O.T.O. member in goodstanding, but possession of a copy (physical or electronic) is restricted to Grand LodgeOfficers, subordinate Grand Lodge Officers, and initiates of at least the KEW degree,without the express permission of the U.S. National Grand Master General. Thishandbook is not to be circulated over the Internet except by U.S. Grand Lodge officers,and is not to be posted on the World Wide Web.The information in this handbook applies only to O.T.O. activities under thejurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of the United States. Requirements for O.T.O. activitiesoutside the U.S. may differ, and questions should be referred to the International SecretaryGeneral. This handbook supersedes all previous versions of the U.S. Camp, Oasis andLodge Master’s Handbook.II. Grand LodgeThe U.S. Grand Lodge of O.T.O. and M.M.M. (Grand Lodge), also known asOrdo Templi Orientis U.S.A, or O.T.O. U.S.A., is a duly chartered Grand Lodge andNational Section of Ordo Templi Orientis. It is a tax-exempt, non-profit religiousorganization duly incorporated under the laws of the State of California. All Initiatemembers of O.T.O. who reside in the U.S.A. (including U.S. territories and dependencies)are members of the U.S. Grand Lodge, and the U.S. Grand Lodge includes all LocalBodies within the U.S.A. Membership in the U.S. Grand Lodge of O.T.O. confersmembership in O.T.O. (International).Grand Lodge Headquarters comprises one Administrative Body and threeGoverning Bodies. The Administrative Body is the Executive Council, also known as the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook2Executive, which functions as the Board of Directors of O.T.O. U.S.A. The Executiveconsists of the three Executive Officers of Grand Lodge Headquarters, the National GrandMaster General X° (Rex Summus Sanctissimus, or Grand Master), the Grand TreasurerGeneral (G.T.G.), and the Grand Secretary General (G.S.G.).The three Governing Bodies of Grand Lodge Headquarters are: the SupremeGrand Council (S.G.C.), which governs the affairs of the Lover Triad (initiate bodiesassociated with the V°-VII°); the Grand Tribunal (G.T.), which investigates and arbitratesdisputes and complaints; and the Electoral College (E.C.), which governs the affairs of theMan of Earth Triad (Lodges, Oases and Camps). The three Executive Officers are, exofficio, members of the Supreme Grand Council.The Executive Officers, the active members of the Governing Bodies of GrandLodge, the Deputy National Grand Master General, the appointed assistants to theDirectors (such as the Initiation Secretary and the Quartermaster), and the SovereignGrand Inspectors General constitute the Officers of Grand Lodge. Subordinate GrandLodge Officers include Masters of official Local Initiate Bodies and Chartered Initiators.Grand Lodge Headquarters reports to the International Headquarters (I.H.Q.) ofO.T.O. The two principal Governing Bodies of International Headquarters are: TheSupreme Council, which functions as the Board of Directors of O.T.O. (International);and the Areopagus of the VIII°. The officers of the Supreme Council are the FraterSuperior (Caliph, or Acting Outer Head of the Order, O.H.O.), the Treasurer General(T.G.) and the Secretary General (S.G.)III. Local BodiesO.T.O. has three levels of Official Local Initiate Bodies (\"Local Bodies\") under thejurisdiction of the Electoral College: Camps, Oases and Lodges. OTO members maypresently join as many Camps, Oases or Lodges as will have them, none or one, as theyprefer.No expelled, suspended, or inactive member may be Master, or any other officer,of a Local Body.Administering an O.T.O. local body is a privilege and a responsibility, not a right.O.T.O. local body officers may be removed, and O.T.O. local bodies closed, at any timeby the Electoral College, with or without cause.Camps and Oases may be headed by members of the Man of Earth Triad; however,according to Liber 194, “The Man of Earth takes no share in the Government of theOrder; for he is not yet called upon to give his life to it in service; and with us Governmentis Service, and nothing else.” Therefore, Masters of Camps and Oases who have not yetbeen received into the Fifth Degree are considered to be in a position of assistance ratherthan leadership, and they are subject to the direct supervision of one or more members ofthe Electoral College."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook3A. CampsThe most basic level of O.T.O. Local Body is the Camp. Camps can be as simpleas study groups and as complex as Oases. Camps may or may not provide initiationfacilities, but usually do not provide initiations above the III°.A Camp may be established by a single O.T.O. Initiate Member in good standingof at least the Third Degree; though, in certain cases, the Electoral College will considerCamp applications from members of the First or Second Degree. All Camps areencouraged to provide classes and/or publish instructional material, and to offer theGnostic Mass on a regular basis.Each Camp must maintain a valid mailing address. In addition, every camp mustkeep accurate records of all financial transactions and make regular financial reports to theG.T.G. as detailed in section IV.A below.Applications for Camp Charter must be directed to the Electoral College.B. OasesThe next level of complexity up from the Camp is the Oasis. An Oasis providesthe essential functions to the membership that are expected of a Lodge: it must provideinitiations from 0° to III°, it should provide instruction in the form of classes and/orwritten materials, and it should endeavor to celebrate the Gnostic Mass on a regular basis.Generally, an Oasis is created from an existing Camp, and must be established byat least three Initiate Members. The Master of the Oasis must hold a Charter to Initiateissued by the X°. An Oasis is an Initiating Body; therefore, it is expected to have allfacilities required to perform initiations through the III°.An Oasis has the same financial and reporting responsibilities as a Camp. Oasesmust, in addition, keep accurate records of initiations performed.Applications for Oasis Charter must be directed to the Electoral College.C. LodgesThe highest level of Local Body under the jurisdiction of the Electoral College isthe Lodge. A Lodge Master must be an Initiate Member of at least the V°, and must holda Charter to Initiate. A Lodge must provide initiations for the members it serves throughthe III°, and must have all facilities required to perform IV° and P.I. initiations. A visiting(or resident) Sovereign Grand Inspector General will usually perform IV° and P.I.;however, Lodges must be able to provide 0° through III° initiations without outsideassistance.A Lodge has all the responsibilities of an Oasis. In addition, Lodges may berequired to assist the Order in legal matters, must keep complete records beyond the usualrequirements of lesser bodies, and are encouraged to produce manuscripts, periodicals,and other publications or creations for the advancement of Thelemic Studies. All Lodgesare expected to celebrate the Gnostic Mass as often as possible.Applications for Lodge Charter must be directed to the Electoral College."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook4IV. Local Body Reporting RequirementsA. FinancialLocal Bodies must maintain records of financial transactions, if any, and providethem to the Grand Treasurer General (G.T.G.) in regular financial reports. Local Bodieswith revenues under $500 per annum must report annually; those with revenues over $500but under $1,000 must report semi-annually; those with revenues over $1,000 must reportquarterly. Financial reports must include a ledger of all financial transactions, as well as asummary statement of income and expenses by category. Receipts should be kept by thelocal body and not sent with the financial report. Forms for financial reporting areavailable from the G.T.G. Use of these forms is encouraged but not mandatory, as long asthe submitted report contains the required information.When a Local Body collects funds from a member for dues, fees, or any otherreason, it must provide the member with a receipt and keep a record of the transaction.Funds held by a Local Body should ordinarily be kept in a separate bank account, which isreserved for Order use and contains no private funds. If the account is a checkingaccount, checks should require the signature of the local body master. Most banks requirea Social Security Number or Federal Tax Identification Number to open a bank account.Grand Lodge recommends that local bodies apply for their own Federal Tax ID Number inthe name of the body by completing IRS form SS-4. The Grand Lodge corporate Tax IDNumber is not to be used by local bodies to establish bank accounts. Further informationand assistance on completing form SS-4 is available from the G.T.G. upon request.The Master is expected to keep his dues up to date. A Local Body may besuspended by the Electoral College or by the Grand Treasurer General if its Master fallssignificantly behind in personal dues payments.The Local Body is expected to assist the G.T.G. in canvassing for back dues, andcopies of dues bills from the G.T.G. are commonly sent to the last point of initiation forthis purpose. The G.T.G. can provide dues statements of local group members, allindividuals initiated at a particular location, and new applicants on request (allow threeweeks for mail, or phone for immediate information). Local bodies are required toprovide information on degree dues payments and initiations to the G.T.G. within 30 daysof the event or the receipt of the payment. The amount paid must be adequately described(who paid for what, when). Information may be provided by electronic mail, so long asthe privacy of the individual members is respected.Forms and other information may be obtained via the Internet at http://www.oto-usa.org/treasury.B. SecretarialLocal bodies must maintain a valid mailing address and keep the Editor of theMagical Link, Electoral College, Grand Treasurer General and Grand Secretary Generalapprised of any changes in address. Failure to maintain a valid mailing address may resultin closure of the body by the Electoral College or by the Grand Secretary General. SinceO.T.O. Local Body addresses are semi-public information, it would be prudent for LocalBodies to use a post office box for their official mailing address. Changes of address thatinvolve relocation of the Local Body require advance approval of the Electoral College."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook5Answer all incoming mail promptly. For Oases and Lodges, the G.S.G. or G.T.G.can usually provide a regional O.T.O. mailing list on request. Camps need approval fromthe Executive to obtain a regional mailing list of local O.T.O. members.C. AdministrativeLocal Bodies must promptly provide any information requested by Grand LodgeOfficers, or Officers of the International Supreme Council. Repeated failure to do so mayresult in suspension or closure of the local body.D. Initiation Related1. Application formsEach degree from Minerval through IV° and P.I. now has its own separateapplication form for use by candidates and Local Bodies. The \"Preliminary Pledge Formand Application for Admission\" is to be completed by candidates for Minerval; the \"I°Application and Pledge Form\" is to be completed by candidates for I°; the \"Application forAdvancement to II°\" is to be completed by candidates for II°; the \"Application forAdvancement to III°\" is to be completed by candidates for III°; and the \"Application forAdvancement to IV° and P.I.\" is to be completed by candidates for IV° and/or P.I. Theseapplication forms are not used for the degrees beyond P.I., which are invitational.Designated portions of the application forms are to be completed by the candidate; theremainder is to be completed by the officers of the initiating body. When completed, theforms are to be submitted to the Initiation Secretary by the initiating body, not by thecandidate.Candidates should not complete application forms until they have fulfilled allrequirements for their advancement, with the exception of the time requirement andpayment of any back dues. Back dues should be paid at the same time as the dues for thenew initiation. The amount of back dues (if any) owed by a candidate may be verifiedwith the G.T.G.Applications must be mailed by the Local Body far enough in advance to ensuretheir receipt by the Initiation Secretary at least 30 days prior to the scheduled date of theinitiations (with the exception of I° application forms when 0° and I° are taken on thesame occasion or within 30 days of each other). The Local Body shall retain copies of allcompleted application forms submitted, and maintain them with its records. The Initiatorwill be contacted by the Initiation Secretary or Grand Secretary General within the 30 dayperiod only if an application cannot be approved, provided the application was submittedin a timely manner. In hardship cases, the 30 day advance notice requirement may bewaived by contacting the Initiation Secretary by telephone or e-mail, but such waiversmust be reported later in the Red Book initiation report and Initiation Summary Report(i.e., \"late application\"). Applications for IV° should include the graded results of thewritten portion of the IV° examination and the names of at least two Minerval initiateswho were sponsored by the candidate. If the graded examination results cannot beincluded with the application, they should be forwarded as soon as possible thereafter.Application for IV° and P.I. may be made using the same form if the IV° and P.I.initiations are to be conducted on the same occasion or within 30 days of each other."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook6The Local Body Master should check to verify that each application form has beenfully and correctly completed. Incomplete or improperly completed forms may bereturned for completion and/or correction, and may thus unnecessarily delay the initiation.Each application form for Minerval through P.I. requires the names and signaturesof two sponsors. All sponsors must be active members of good report, and must hold atleast the I° and at least the degree to which the candidate is seeking admission. Names ofsponsors should be written legibly, and civil names should be used rather than magicalnames or mottoes. Care should be taken in sponsoring candidates; because, according toLiber CI, Twelfth House, \"it is incumbent upon the honour of every Brother not to abuse[the privileges of membership], and the sponsors of any Brother who does so, as well ashe himself, will be held strictly to account by the Grand Tribunal.\" Before signing on assponsors to a candidate, prospective sponsors should familiarize themselves with thecandidate's character and background. However, sponsorship is a matter for the sponsorsto decide, and local bodies may not impose their own restrictions on sponsorship.Minerval (0°) and I° initiations may be conducted on the same occasion at allCamps, Oases and Lodges. However, you must make it very clear to the Candidate forMinerval that the I° creates a permanent link with the Order, and that there is no stigmaattached to remaining a Minerval for as long as it takes to decide whether or not toproceed. Under no circumstances shall the I° Application and Pledge Form be filled outby a Candidate who has not already been initiated into the 0°. If the Candidate thinks heor she might be interested in taking I° on the same occasion as his or her Minerval, he orshe should obtain a I° robe, but should wait until after the 0° ceremony to decide whetherto complete the I° Application and Pledge Form. I° Application and Pledge Forms filledout in this manner may be sent to the Initiation Secretary after the ceremony along withthe Initiation Summary Report and certificates.2. Initiation ReportsAfter the initiations have taken place, the Local Body must promptly complete andsubmit two Initiation Reports: an \"Initiation Financial Report\" (\"Red Book\") is submittedto the G.T.G.; and an \"Initiation Summary Report\" is submitted to the Initiation Secretary.The Red Book must include all the information set forth on the cover, includingthe name of the initiating Local Body, names and degrees of the initiating officers, namesand mailing addresses of the new initiates, date and time of the initiations, degree(s)worked, dues and fees collected from each candidate, and a summary of dues and feescollected for the initiations. It should also include a description of any unusualcircumstances: e.g. Grand Master's permission for short time between initiations, waiverof timely application by an Executive Officer, any untoward event at the initiation, anyneed for special privacy for the candidate, etc. The completed Red Book, along with acheck or money order to cover the dues of each candidate, including any back dues, mustbe mailed to the G.T.G. within 30 days of the ceremony.The Initiation Summary Report may consist of either a photocopy of the RedBook, or a brief letter report including the names and degrees of the officers and the newinitiates, any changed addresses, and any unusual circumstances, as discussed above. Thecompleted Initiation Summary Report, along with a completed degree certificate for eachinitiate, must be mailed to the Initiation Secretary within 30 days of the ceremony."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook7The Master of the Initiating Body has the primary responsibility for the accuratecompletion and timely submission of Initiation Reports, with the assistance of the Initiatorand other Local Body officers as necessary. Please fill out the Initiation Reports as legiblyas possible, and include all requested information. Complete personal mailing addresses,including legal names and postal codes, are required for each initiate. Double check thecompleted Initiation Report to insure that the date of the initiation, the place of theinitiation and the degree initiated are included, along with each initiate's name, address anddetails of payments made. The Local Body shall retain copies of all completed InitiationReports submitted, and maintain them with its records. Initiation Reports should never befilled out before the ceremony has taken place, but a scribe may be delegated to performthis duty during or immediately following the initiation of each candidate. If report of initiations is delayed beyond 30 days after the event, the initiatingLocal Body may be suspended by the President of the Electoral College or any of the threeExecutive Officers. In extreme cases, the initiation may have to be repeated by thecandidate(s), the initiating Local Body may be closed, and/or the initiation charterrevoked.3. CertificatesStandard initiation certificate copy masters are available from the Quartermaster,the Initiation Secretary, or the Grand Secretary General. Local Bodies may design theirown initiation certificates, but the design must be submitted to the G.S.G. and receive theapproval of the X° prior to use. The old certificate designs with hand calligraphy are nowdiscontinued and are not to be used.The completed certificates are to be sent by the Local Body to the InitiationSecretary within 30 days after the initiations, along with the Initiation Summary Report.The legal name of the initiate must appear on the certificate.Signed and sealed certificates for 0° through P.I. will generally be returned to thespecified Local Body, which is then responsible for the safe and prompt distribution of thecertificates to the initiates.Certificates which are lost or which contain mistakes should be remade by theLocal Body, signed by the original Initiator, and resubmitted to the Initiation Secretary assoon as possible. If the Local Body is closed, the Initiation Secretary can usually providea replacement certificate. If the original Initiator is no longer available, the replacementcertificate will be signed by the Initiation Secretary or Grand Secretary General on behalfof the original Initiator.4. General Requirements for InitiatorsAll O.T.O. initiations must be performed under the purview of a chartered LocalBody of O.T.O., with the express sanction of the Local Body Master. Minerval throughK.E.W. initiations must be performed under the purview of an O.T.O. Camp, Oasis orLodge. I° through III° initiations should ideally be performed under the purview of anOasis or Lodge. IV°, P.I. and K.E.W. initiations should ideally be performed under thepurview of a Lodge. In cases where an initiation cannot be performed under the purviewof a chartered Local Body, it may be performed under the auspices of Grand Lodge"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook8Headquarters with the express advance permission of, and under the supervision of, anExecutive Officer.Applications for Charters to Initiate to the Minerval through III° are made to theElectoral College. The Electoral College evaluates such applications and makesrecommendations to the X°, in whom the Frater Superior has vested the sole power toissue and revoke Initiation Charters within the U.S. Grand Lodge. Initiation Chartersbecome void if the member holding the Charter is expelled or suspended frommembership, or lapses into inactive membership through failure to pay dues.Initiators who travel to locations where there is an existing Local Body shall obtainthe sanction of the Local Body Master prior to conducting any initiations in the area.Initiators who travel outside the U.S. to perform initiations must first obtain clearancefrom the International Secretary General.When candidates from another country travel to a local body within the U.S. forinitiation, the Master of the local body must first obtain clearance from the InternationalSecretary General. There are slight but important differences between the initiation ritualsperformed within the U.S. and those performed outside the U.S., as well as significantdifferences in reporting requirements. In addition, OTO members who reside in othercountries pay dues according to different scales than that used in the U.S., even if they areinitiated within the U.S. However, whereas dues are assessed based on country ofresidence, initiation fees are assessed based on the point of initiation.5. Requirements for Candidates\"Every man and woman that is of full age, free, and of good report, has anindefeasible right to the III°\" -- Liber LII.Currently, \"full age\" is interpreted as at least 18 years old, \"free\" is interpreted as\"not incarcerated or incapable of taking and keeping a binding oath to the Order,\" and \"ofgood report\" is interpreted as \"not on bad report, suspended or expelled\" (Note: BadReport status may be imposed by Grand Lodge Headquarters if the candidate has beenconvicted of a serious crime.) This general right of access is to the entire Man of EarthTriad, Minerval through P.I., and invitation is not required for these degrees.Initiates must spend a minimum of nine months within the I° before proceeding tothe II°, a minimum of one year within the II° before proceeding to the III°, and a minimumof one year within the III° before proceeding to the IV°. The IV° and P.I. initiations maybe taken on the same occasion. There is no stigma attached to remaining in a degree foras long as it takes to decide whether or not to proceed. Beyond the P.I., all initiations areby invitation only.Minimum time requirements within the degrees may only be waived by the directorder of the Grand Master, which can be requested by contacting the Initiation Secretaryor Grand Secretary General. Waivers of standard time requirements by the Grand Mastermust be noted in the Red Book.The Master of the Initiating Body has the responsibility to verify the dues status ofthe candidates initiated under his or her purview. Financial bad report results in a hold onadvancement to the next degree. If local records are inadequate, an e-mail or letter ofrequest for dues statements 40 or more days in advance of the planned initiation, or aphone call to the Grand Treasurer General, will usually yield the desired information."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook9Back dues must be paid before initiation takes place, prorated to the month of thescheduled initiation. Chronic failure to collect back dues may result in suspension orclosure of the Local Body responsible.In the case of traveling members taking initiation outside their home area, theMaster of the Initiating Body has the responsibility, when possible, to contact the LocalBody or Bodies where the candidate's previous initiations were taken to verify the goodreport of the candidate. In the case of members traveling from other countries to takeinitiation in the U.S., the Master of the Initiating Body should obtain clearance from theInternational Supreme Council prior to performing such initiations. The Initiator has theresponsibility to assist the Local Body Master in performing the above duties, if necessary;but the Local Body is ultimately responsible.There are certain specific requirements for advancement to particular degrees. Aparticular task specified in the II° ritual must be accomplished prior to advancement to theIII°. This task is to be accomplished in accordance with each individual candidate'sinterpretation of the task, without aid, instruction or interpretation from the Initiator orLocal Body Master. Certain information on the completion of this task is to be providedby the candidate for III° on the III° application form; but otherwise, the candidate's wordthat this task has been successfully completed is to be considered as adequate, and furtherevidence is not required. Prior to advancement to the IV°, a candidate must have broughttwo persons to the Minerval degree (preferably sponsoring them) that were subsequentlyinitiated to the Minerval degree. Also, the candidate must take the examination adoptedand issued by the Electoral College, and must pass the portion dealing with the secrets ofthe preceding degrees. This portion may be taken several times on a single occasion, ifnecessary. The other, written portion is to be graded and attached to the application form,and the score reported to the candidate; but a low score is not grounds for denying orpostponing initiation. Both parts of the IV° examination may be taken any time after thecandidate has taken the III°. Outside of these requirements, minimum time requirements,and questions of dues status and good report, an Initiator may not impose additionalrequirements for advancement on any candidate, such as tasks or examinations.Whenever an individual is refused initiation on any grounds, the Local BodyMaster must make a written report to the Executive on said refusal and the reasons for itwithin 30 days. Such information may be included in the Red Book. Individual candidateshave the right to appeal directly to the Executive.E. Annual Reports to the Electoral CollegeAll Camps, Oases and Lodges are required to report annually on their activities tothe Electoral College. Annual reports to the Electoral College are due by February 15 ofeach year. A reporting form is available from the Electoral College Secretary.Annual Reports are reviewed by members of the Electoral College at the Springmeeting. After this meeting, certified letters will be sent to the official bodies that have notfiled Annual Reports. A list of non-reporting bodies will also be submitted to Agape forpublication.The masters or acting masters of these bodies will have thirty (30) days fromreceipt of the certified letter to submit an Annual Report. If the report is not receivedwithin that period of time, that body will be placed on the agenda for closure at the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook10Summer meeting of the Electoral College. Reports received after the thirty (30) daysshould be accompanied by an explanation for the delay in submission. This informationwill be added to the agenda as the master's explanation of mitigating circumstances andwill be considered by the Electoral College in its discussions of that body's closure.F. Local Body Reports for AgapeReports of Local Body activities and similar news may be submitted to the Editorof Agape for publication. Such reporting is optional, but highly recommended.V. Dues, Fees and DonationsA. GeneralO.T.O. operates primarily on dues and fees collected from the membership.Members are charged with the obligation of supporting the Order to the fullest extent oftheir financial means. Annual dues are established by the Order as a minimumcontribution. Fees are set for each initiation to help defray the costs of the initiation itself.The annual dues are sent to the Grand Treasurer General for the general operating fund ofthe Order. Initiation Fees and Local Fees remain with the Local Bodies.B. Current Schedule of Dues and FeesA complete schedule of current dues and fees may be obtained from the U.S.Grand Treasurer General.C. Local Dues and FeesInitiation Fees may be decreased or waived by the Initiating Body. Additionally,the Initiating Body itself may, with the permission of the G.T.G., charge its own duesand/or surcharges to help cover its operating costs. These surcharges and local duesshould be consistent and reasonable, and should not be imposed on Candidates who comefrom a long distance. The exception is in the case of extraordinary expenses, such aspayment of travel expenses for guest Initiators when opening a new degree. In such cases,an additional assessment is warranted. If in doubt, consult the G.T.G. The GrandTreasurer General has the right to modify or abolish any local dues or surcharges he or shebelieves to be unwarranted.Except for dues (including annual dues) and fees reported in the Red Books, noother purely local dues and surcharges are tracked in the accounting records of GrandLodge Headquarters. Local bodies are required to maintain good records of all financialtransactions, including amount, name, date and nature. These records must be reported tothe G.T.G. on schedule or on demand.D. Payment of DuesDues are payable for each new initiation at the point of initiation, after approval ofthe application but before commencement of the initiation ceremony. Any outstandingdues balances should be paid at the same time. After the initiation has taken place, dues"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook11are payable each year directly to the Grand Treasurer General, by the anniversary of thedate of the initiation, until the next initiation has been taken.If, for any reason, an initiation is canceled, or if a candidate declines to completean initiation ceremony which has begun, the dues (but not necessarily the fees) arerefunded to the candidate. Questions should be referred to the Grand Treasurer General.Dues for initiations should not be sent in to the G.T.G. until after the event, butmust be sent within 30 days of the initiation.Failure of Minervals and Associates to remain dues-current results in expiration ofmembership (sometimes referred to as \"demit\"). Failure of Initiate Members of I° andhigher to remain dues-current results in a change of membership status from active toinactive. However, such demit or inactive status is not automatic for Minervals and otherinitiates. An attempt to bill the lapsed member must be made, with reasonable time for themember to respond. Thus, if a Minerval is not billed for three years, that individualremains a Minerval member with back dues accruing until such time as the member isbilled and formally demitted. After demit or inactive determination, such accrued backdues are no longer payable. However, if the member desires to continue in membershipwithout demit or formal inactive time, the accrued back dues will be required.Expired (demitted) Minervals owe no reentry fee on returning through I° initiation.If a remaining balance from the first Minerval year or any transaction balance other thandues renewal exists, it must be paid before the I° initiation. Initiators are expected to callattention to reentering Minervals to facilitate the work of Grand Lodge recording officers.Resigned, Suspended or Expelled members can only be readmitted throughresolution of the Executive, and no reentry fee is required. Inactive members arereadmitted through payment of either twice the dues at the reentry degree level, or oneyear's dues at the inactive degree plus dues and fees for the next degree if initiation istaken as a part of return to membership. Inactive members must also pay any residualbalance owing in their accounts, other than unpaid renewals in the last active degree.In cases of returning members, the reentry fee is assessed at the dues rate in effectat the time of return.E. Payment of FeesFees are payable at the point of initiation upon applying for a new initiation. If aninitiation is canceled due to failure of the candidate to show up for the initiation, or if acandidate declines to complete an initiation ceremony which has begun, the Local Body ispermitted to retain any authorized fees collected in advance. If an initiation is canceled forany reason other than the above, the Grand Treasurer General must be consulted as to thedisposition of any fees collected in advance.F. DonationsMembers are always welcome to make whatever additional contributions anddonations they may wish. Dues, fees and donations to Grand Lodge may be taxdeductible, subject to any limitations and restrictions set forth in current State and Federalincome tax laws.Donations to local O.T.O. operations may not be tax deductible, unless they arereported to the G.T.G. with an explicit arrangement and letter of request that the donation"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook12be recorded by the G.T.G. as a donation to Grand Lodge for the benefit of the localoperation. Such donations must be irrevocable, must be for the non-profit purpose ofO.T.O., must not be used for loans, must not be used to influence legislation or election,and must not accrue to the benefit of any individual. The G.T.G. will respond by letterand receipt to the donor.Donations of office equipment to Local Bodies or books donated to O.T.O.libraries require that the Local Body issue an itemized receipt. The archival name orstamp must be placed in the books. Such donations are irrevocable and any attempt toeffect the return of the donated material will be grounds for bad report.G. Labor CreditDues may be defrayed by labor for Grand Lodge, at a rate rounded to the nearestdollar below the federal minimum hourly wage. Typing and key entry may be assessed attwo double spaced pages equal to one hour. Labor credit must be attested by physicalevidence or by signature of an O.T.O. officer (such as the Master of a Local Body) otherthan the member requesting the credit. The G.T.G. must approve all such cases inadvance. Work done strictly for a local group does not apply to GrandLodge/International dues.If a member has been mistakenly informed that a local donation or service will beaccounted by Grand Lodge Headquarters for their dues, the G.T.G. will determine if avalid inducement of promise has been made. In the case of a valid inducement of promiseby a Local Body, the G.T.G. may elect to assign the dues promised by debit of the accountof the Local Body or local officer responsible. Failure to cover debit balances can result inclosure of a Local Body or loss of active membership. Promise of dues credit in theabsence of knowledge of procedure and/or G.T.G. advance approval is usurpation ofauthority. Severe or frequent instances may result in expulsion.H. ExpensesGrand Lodge Officers, and members assisting temporarily in Grand Lodgebusiness, may apply for Grand Lodge dues credit or reimbursement of expenses made forGrand Lodge business. These expenses must be reported on the designated form availablefrom the G.T.G., with copies of all receipts attached. The G.T.G. will always accede to arequest to apply such expenses to Grand Lodge dues, but may of financial necessitydecline to reimburse in funds, assigning to current or future Grand Lodge dues instead.Advance approval by the G.T.G. is also required.Purely local expenses, including telephone expenses, are never assignable to theGrand Lodge or I.H.Q., but they may be reported as donations via the Grand Lodge forthe benefit of the local O.T.O. Such reporting must take the form noted in section F(above) for local donations. Travel and hospitality, including room rental, are purely localexpenses unless special Grand Lodge or I.H.Q. meetings or initiations are involved.Initiation equipment is a local expense, except for Grand Lodge permanent operations andsome new openings of degrees. G.T.G. advance determination is required in all instancesof Grand Lodge expense allotment. Receipts are required. Travel and reasonable"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook13expenses for postage, phone and office supplies are assignable to Grand Lodge dues ordirectly reimbursable for Electoral College, Grand Tribunal, Supreme Grand Council, andExecutive Officer expenses. In all other cases (such as for Local Body Masters), contactthe G.T.G. for a determination.Grand Lodge Officers and subordinate Grand Lodge Officers (including LocalBody Masters), may, with the informed consent of the G.T.G., transfer Grand Lodge duescredit as dues to meet obligations of other Grand Lodge members or to provide routineinitiation dues transfers to Grand Lodge. Transfer of dues between individual membersother than officers is subject to permission or denial by the G.T.G.Dues balances of deceased, suspended, expelled or resigned members are notusually refundable. Such dues balances may be transferred if the G.T.G. agrees and noclaim of tax deduction has been made.Members holding VIIIth or IXth degree pay dues directly to O.T.O. InternationalHeadquarters. Accordingly, expenses cannot be simply taken to dues credit for membersof those degrees. Such members incurring expenses on behalf of either O.T.O. U.S.A. orO.T.O. (International) should contact the G.T.G. and the International Treasurer Generalon such matters, before incurring the expenses.VI. Fund RaisingHistorically, Local Bodies have raised funds by publishing, seminars, guestlectures, book sales, tape sales, T-shirt sales, group garage sales, theatrical productionsand many other activities. Grand Lodge Headquarters does not consider it appropriate tooffer magical or spiritual services for monetary gain. An official fund raising activityshould have a stated purpose, and all profits from the activity must be used for thatpurpose. Activities which involve contributions which are to be tax deductible must beapproved by the G.T.G. in advance and reported in full detail.VII. Local PublicationsIf your Local Body is interested in publishing, it may publish its own material orOrder archival material. Contact O.T.O. International Headquarters if you are interestedin publishing a piece of Crowley's work or other Archival material. Material published byO.T.O. bodies, or any material by Aleister Crowley, regardless of the publisher, must havethe following notice either on the cover or the first page after the cover:Copyright © [year] Ordo Templi OrientisLocal Body periodicals must also contain the following disclaimer, \"Theviewpoints and opinions expressed herein are the responsibility of the contributingauthors.\"If there is original material in the publication, the text \"and the individual authors\"may be inserted after \"Ordo Templi Orientis\" in the above notice.

Box 684098Austin, TX 78768U.S.A.O.T.O. International Headquarters frequently engages in publishing contracts withcommercial publishing houses. If you plan to publish material which has already beencommercially published, and your publication is intended for sale to the public, contact theInternational Secretary General in advance to ensure that your publication will not causecontractual difficulties.Copies of all Local Body and other O.T.O. publications, including calendars andperiodicals, must be sent to the following O.T.O. officers: one to the above address, oneto the G.S.G. one to the G.T.G., one to the E.C. President and one to the E.C. Secretary,at the addresses listed in the latest issue of Agape.VIII. Miscellaneous Policy MattersA. AdvertisingAll national advertising shall originate from the Executive only. Local advertisingof events such as lectures or classes, etc. may be done by Local Bodies. It is stronglysuggested that the Master of the Local Body contact an Executive Officer for commentsprior to placing any print ad.B. TrademarksThe O.T.O. Lamen, the name \"Ordo Templi Orientis\" and the letters \"O.T.O.\" areregistered trademarks of Ordo Templi Orientis.C. LetterheadO.T.O. Letterhead is to be used only by O.T.O. officers for official O.T.O.business. You may only use it for official business of your recognized O.T.O. group, notfor private correspondence. The O.T.O. Letterhead must not be altered to include other,non-O.T.O. groups or organizations. Officers must keep a file copy of any letters sent onO.T.O. letterhead, and files of such letters are O.T.O. property.D. BylawsA copy of the O.T.O. U.S.A. and International corporate Bylaws may be viewed atany Lodge. Camp and Oasis Masters may also obtain copies by writing to theQuartermaster. At their option, Local Bodies may draft their own Bylaws for the approvalof the Electoral College. Such bylaws are not effective without written approval from the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook15Electoral College. Sample Camp, Oasis and Lodge Bylaws are available from theQuartermaster.E. FirearmsFirearms are prohibited at O.T.O. functions and events unless carried by a lawenforcement officer or licensed security guard in the performance of his or her duty.F. DrugsNo illegal drugs are permitted at any O.T.O. events.Confirmed sales or solicitation for sales of illegal substances at a place and time(including time to arrive and depart on the occasion of a meeting) of O.T.O. is grounds forexpulsion; and, in the event of complicity by officers of the O.T.O. body, automaticallycloses the body. In addition, sales of illicit substances or solicitation for sales at a placeused solely by O.T.O., regardless of the time of meetings, or by any person so acting as toconvey either expressly or otherwise the impression that such sales or solicitation for salesis in any way a part of official O.T.O. activity, shall also fall under the strictures andremedies of expulsion and closure as may be appropriate to the actual status of the personor officer of the official body involved.G. General ConductHere are a few helpful hints toward keeping your Local Body open andfunctioning:- Read this document at least once every year.- Don't modify the initiation rituals; perform them in accordance with theannotated ritual manual issued by the X°. In special cases, such as for candidates withdisabilities, certain modifications to the rituals may be made, but only with the specificpermission of the Executive.- Don't perform the initiation rituals or appear in O.T.O. temple regalia in public.- Don't participate in \"magical wars.\" Don't give credence to magical attacks.- Don't intervene in domestic disputes.- Don't interfere in the private lives of O.T.O. members unduly, unless asked toarbitrate a non-marital dispute by both parties.- Don't permit any violence or abuse of property.- Don't attack or slander other organizations, but do defend O.T.O.'s reputation.- Don't make media statements without Executive approval.- Don't sacrifice animals or perform any other actions or practices which mightadversely affect the Order's reputation or legal standing, including public performance ofthe Mass of the Phoenix, Liber Jugorum, or explicit sexual acts at official or public-accessevents.- Be courteous to your neighbors. Respect their right to peace and quiet duringlate hours.- Discourage gossip.- Tolerate opinions that differ from your own.- Maintain good relations with other Local Bodies.- Maintain the peace of the Temple."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook16- Make guests feel welcome.- Answer your mail promptly, including letters from people asking about O.T.O.(this includes electronic mail, if you publicize your e-mail address as an official contact foryour body).H. Bad Report and ComplaintsThe Local Body Master is responsible for the orderly conduct of the Local Body'sbusiness. Unruly or abusive individuals at events should be counseled to moderate theirconduct, and failing success at that, should be asked to leave. Refusal to leave whenasked can establish grounds for either local or order-wide bad report, depending on thegravity of the offense and the involvement of Grand Lodge. Appeal to Liber OZ does notconstitute a defense against a request to leave a sponsored event or official location.Informal, local bad report may be declared by any Local Body Master when amember has made him or herself unwelcome through unruly, abusive, or disruptiveconduct. Local Body Masters must immediately file each instance of local bad report,including the name(s) of the member(s) placed on local bad report and the reasons forsuch placement, with the Executive. If the Executive deems the local bad report to beunjustified, it may reverse it. A member on local bad report may not attend O.T.O.functions at the location under the Local Body Master, nor attend any functions on O.T.O.or private property administered by the Local Body Master; but said member shall not berestricted in any other way. In particular, other O.T.O. members shall not be told to avoidthe individual on bad report or be punished in any way for associating with him or her.Local bad report can be appealed to the Executive.Formal, order-wide bad report of an O.T.O. member can only be declared byGrand Tribunal (G.T.) or Executive resolution. A member on formal bad report may nottake an O.T.O. initiation at any location until his or her bad report status is removed.Violation of this rule by misrepresentation to an Initiator or Local Body Master is groundsfor expulsion.A request to place a member on order-wide bad report (or for any otherdisciplinary action, or for arbitration of a dispute) must be submitted in the form of acomplaint to the Grand Tribunal in writing, signed and dated. All pertinent details,including all names and dates, a clear statement of charges, a statement of requestedremedies, if any, and signed and dated testimony of witnesses should be included. Whenthe complaint involves a specific offense against a member by another member, theoffended party must submit the complaint. When the complaint involves chronic behaviorpatterns or a history of problems, the Local Body Master should submit the complaint.Copies of the complaint should be sent to the Executive, the Electoral College, and theindividual being charged. The individual being charged must be advised of their right tofile a defense with the Local Body, the Electoral College and the Executive.Acts greatly prejudicial to the purposes of the Order, or repeated failure to abideby the rules and regulations of the Order are grounds for suspension or expulsion frommembership. Violent behavior, abuse of children, conversion of O.T.O. assets, legalaction against O.T.O., and criminal conduct are considered greatly prejudicial to thepurposes of the Order. Suspension and expulsion require a resolution by the Executive.The only exception to this rule is that the X° may suspend or expel a member in a case of"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook17extreme emergency. Such action must be defended to the Executive and InternationalSupreme Council within 72 hours, and ratified by Executive resolution in order to becompletely formalized.Anonymous charges against O.T.O. members cannot be accepted and will not beconsidered by the Executive, the Grand Tribunal or the Electoral College. If an offendedmember feels he or she has a legitimate need for confidentiality due to fear of violentreprisal or blackmail, the Local Body Master should submit the complaint on behalf of theoffended member with a cover letter confirming his or her judgment that the need forconfidentiality is legitimate.Complaints against Local Body Masters regarding perceptions of improperconduct of Local Body business, unsafe conditions, or failure to observe stated Orderpolicies may be submitted by any member. Such complaints must be submitted in writing,signed and dated, to the Electoral College and the Executive, and/or to the responsibleSovereign Grand Inspector General (S.G.I.G.), for review. The Electoral College,Executive, or S.G.I.G. will then forward the complaint to the Grand Tribunal ifappropriate.Complaints regarding the technical performance of initiation rituals should bediscussed with a Sovereign Grand Inspector General (SGIG) or filed in writing with theExecutive. Initiation rituals and the Gnostic Mass in progress should not be interruptedunless for a serious danger to life, health, property or security. It is better to do aninitiation ritual over than to disrupt the event on a suspicion of minor error. The presenceof a nonmember who is also not a candidate at an initiation requires interruption of theinitiation, as soon as detected.Decisions of the Grand Tribunal or Executive may be appealed to the Areopagusupon obtaining permission to do so from a member of the Electoral College. Suchpermission may be solicited by writing to the Secretary of the Electoral College.I. Confidentiality1. Confidential Membership InformationMembership of any individual in O.T.O. shall not be made known to the public(those who have not signed a Preliminary Pledge Form) except upon the informed consentof the member. The O.T.O. membership and mailing lists are only released to thoseO.T.O. officers who have a specific need for such information. However, a public claimto or denial of membership by an individual is deemed consent for the O.T.O. to publiclydiscuss the membership or non-membership of that individual to the same extent as theindividual's public claim or denial.In general, any degree held by a member should only be revealed to other memberswho hold a degree in the same Triad. P.I.s may reveal their rank to Minervals, and VII°smay reveal their rank to V°s. Knights of the East and West should be known as Princes ofJerusalem except to other Knights of the East and West. A certain amount of degreeconfidentiality may be forfeited by those who assume leadership positions; for example,most Minervals know that Lodge Masters must be at least V° and that persons acting asSovereign Grand Inspectors General must be at least VII°."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook18Note that use of electronic mail to provide information to Grand LodgeHeadquarters should be done in such a way that privacy of the members is assured. Anindividual member should not be fully identified as to name, degree and address inelectronic mail without the permission of that individual member. Electronic mail is not afully private medium of communication.2. Confidential MeetingsThe proceedings and minutes of the official meetings of all governing bodies ofO.T.O. are confidential unless specifically released by the governing body concerned or bythe Executive.Performances of O.T.O. initiation rituals are strictly confidential to the initiates ofthe degree being worked. Only active O.T.O. members on good report who have beenduly initiated into a particular degree are entitled to the privilege of attending initiationrituals for that degree. Others shall not attend or be permitted to attend initiations or viewritual scripts or temple arrangements of that degree, and shall not be unnecessarilyinformed regarding anything pertaining thereto, including the oath.3. Confidential DocumentsO.T.O. considers its initiation rituals and the official instructional documents of itsdegrees, particularly those of the VII°, VIII°, IX° and X°, to be confidential to the initiatesof the degree in question.O.T.O. ritual scripts shall be kept in the possession of Chartered Initiators, exceptthat they may be temporarily lent to O.T.O. members holding at least the degree inquestion for the purposes of study, rehearsal and working of initiations. These are not tobe copied.Any published editions of the O.T.O. initiation rituals, such as the edition byFrancis King, are to be treated as confidential documents by O.T.O. members, regardlessof their accuracy or lack thereof. It is not appropriate for O.T.O. members to sell ordistribute copies of such documents without the express permission of the X°. Should anO.T.O. member find a copy for sale to the public, it would be appropriate for the memberto purchase it; however, Grand Lodge Headquarters strongly recommends that candidatesfor initiation into a degree of O.T.O. wait until after they have been initiated into thatdegree before reading the ritual of that degree.The official instructional documents of the VII°, VIII°, IX° and X° are to betreated as strictly confidential to the members of those degrees, even though versions ofsome of these documents have been published. These documents, even publishedversions, should not be sold, circulated or distributed by O.T.O. members without theexpress permission of the X°. If you are unsure whether a document you possess isconfidential, write to the Grand Secretary General or Grand Treasurer General forverification.Should any O.T.O. initiation ritual or confidential O.T.O. document be foundposted on an Internet web site or on an electronic bulletin board system (BBS) by anO.T.O. member, the member should report the incident to the Executive as soon aspossible."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook19J. Age RequirementsThose under 18 years of age are not eligible for Minerval initiation; but may beeligible for Associate Membership, which is available by writing to the InternationalTreasurer General and sending $10.00 dues per year.K. RelocationOfficial bodies do not automatically change locations when their master moves. AMaster of a Local Body who plans on relocating should recommend a successor to theElectoral College. The Electoral College must approve all Local Body relocations inadvance.An Initiator or Master of a Local Body who relocates to an area where there areexisting Local Bodies should contact the Masters of said Local Bodies and endeavor toestablish good fraternal relations with them.L. Relations With Other OrganizationsIn general, O.T.O. does not take cognizance of its members' participation in othergroups. However, it is inappropriate for O.T.O. members to hold membership in otherorganizations which: (a) claim authority in O.T.O. or E.G.C.; (b) appropriate the name\"Ordo Templi Orientis,\" the name \"Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica,\" or official O.T.O. rituals,documents and/or trademarks for their own use; (c) actively dispute O.T.O's legitimacy orright to exist; or (d) hold policies which would interfere with the conscientious observanceof an O.T.O. member's obligations within O.T.O.O.T.O. members who also hold membership in other organizations should bear itin mind that O.T.O. will not abide other initiatory organizations proselytizing among itsranks. It is not necessary for O.T.O. members to keep their other affiliations secret, butactive recruitment within O.T.O. is inappropriate. This is especially important for officialO.T.O. representatives such as Local Body Masters, who have been entrusted withprotecting and advancing the interests of O.T.O. Local Body Masters or initiators, who,in the sole judgment of the National Grand Master General, have a conflict of interest,shall have their charters revoked.The following are a few examples of what Grand Lodge Headquarters considers toconstitute \"active recruitment\": proselytizing for other initiatory organizations at O.T.O.events; distributing promotional literature for other initiatory organizations at O.T.O.events; publishing advertisements for other initiatory organizations in O.T.O. newsletters;publishing notices of events of other initiatory organizations in O.T.O. newsletters (unlessthe event is co-sponsored by O.T.O.); and creating an atmosphere where any O.T.O.member might feel unwelcome or uncomfortable at an O.T.O. event solely because he orshe does not hold membership in some other, non-O.T.O., organization as well.On the other hand, the development of cordial relations, dialogue and fellowshipwith friendly organizations is encouraged. Notwithstanding the above, occasional mentionof public events by non-O.T.O. groups and organizations may be appropriate in O.T.O.newsletters, so long as the events are of interest to O.T.O. members, the mention isinfrequent and the events in question do not involve recruitment by the non-O.T.O.organizations. When in doubt, leave it out."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook20M. Nonconsensual Sexual ConductAs expressed in Liber CI, the Order exists in part to foster free and joyful relationsbetween its members. However, sexual conduct that is not between fully consentingadults is antithetical to freedom and is not tolerated in O.T.O.Freedom has no room for coercion, and refusing an unwanted sexual advance isnot \"un-Thelemic.\" No O.T.O. member should ever be forced, pressured, or made to feelobligated to have sexual relations with any other O.T.O. member, for any reason. Camp,Oasis and Lodge Masters, Initiators and other O.T.O. officers, as well as members ofhigher degrees, should exercise caution to avoid abusing their authority, or perceivedauthority, in this regard. They shall also endeavor to ensure that candidates in ourinitiation rituals are not subjected to \"groping\" or other inappropriate behavior by thosepresent. In particular, the initiatory circumstances of the I° shall always be conducted withsuitable dignity and respect for the candidate.N. Initiate Study ProgramsO.T.O. offers a voluntary course of reading and practice for initiates. Copymasters of the Study Guide for each degree are available from the Quartermaster. LocalBodies may distribute additional appropriate instructional material to local initiates, butsuch material should not include identifiable quotations from the rituals or explicitinterpretations of the mysteries of higher degrees. Local Bodies must submit copies ofsuch additional study material to the G.S.G. Grand Lodge Headquarters reserves the rightto review, and approve or reject, local study materials. If desired, Local Bodies may issuespecial diplomas for satisfactory completion of local study programs.O. Contacting Grand LodgeA list of current mail and e-mail addresses for Grand Lodge officers is maintainedon the U.S. Grand Lodge web site, and is included in each issue of Agape, the U.S. GrandLodge newsletter, which is distributed quarterly to each U.S. Local Body.P. Liability InsuranceWhen local OTO events are held at private residences, Grand Lodge stronglyrecommends that they be held at residences which are covered by homeowner's or renter'sliability insurance.IX. Customs and ConventionsA. RegaliaO.T.O. robes and regalia should conform to standards issued by Grand LodgeHeadquarters. Robes and regalia should be worn only for official O.T.O. membershipactivities or personal workings, and should not be worn in public. Members attending aninitiation within the Man of Earth Triad who possess a rank higher than that being workedon the occasion should wear only the \"fixed\" regalia corresponding to their rank in theMan of Earth Triad while in Temple. The \"fixed\" regalia include the I° robe and anythingthat is intended to be permanently attached to it. Only the Initiating Officer should wear"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook21headgear while in Temple, with certain specific exceptions that are explicitly described inthe ritual scripts. Regalia should be kept as simple as possible, unnecessaryembellishments should be avoided.B. Forms of AddressCertain forms or styles of address are used in formal correspondence withmembers of the various degrees of O.T.O. These should be employed when you (1) arewriting to someone whose degree is known to you, or (2) when you are writing to anofficer whose office is associated with a particular degree, whether you know the officer'sactual degree or not. For instance, if writing to the President of the Electoral College,you would use the form of address for a Senator; if writing to a member of the GrandTribunal, you would use the form of address for a G.I.C. When in doubt, keep it simple:Dear Brother (Sister).The official forms of address for formal correspondence are given below:0°-III° (Men): Dear Sir and Brother. (Women): Dear Madam and Sister.IV°: Excellent Companion.K.E.W. (Men): Instructed Brother. (Women): Instructed Sister.V° (Men): Very Excellent and Perfect Prince.

(Women): Very Excellent and Perfect Princess, and Noble Dame of the Red Eagle.VI° (Men): Illustrious Sir Knight. (Women): Illustrious Dame Companion of the Holy Grail.G.I.C. (Men): Illustrious and Just Sir Knight. (Women): Illustrious and Just Dame Knight.P.R.S. (Men): Illustrious, Just and Enlightened Sir Knight. (Women): Illustrious, Just and Enlightened Dame Knight.VII° (Men): Very Illustrious Sir Knight. (Women): Very Illustrious Dame Knight.Supreme Grand Council: as VII°, adding \"and Most Wise and Excellent  Councillor of His Most Sacred Majesty.\"VIII°: Perfectly Illuminated and Very Illustrious Brother [Sister].IX°: Thrice Holy, Thrice Illuminated and Thrice Illustrious Brother [Sister].X°: Most Holy, Most Illuminated and Most Worshipful Father [Mother]. Othermembers of X° write \"Brother\" or \"Sister\" for \"Father\" or \"Mother.\" The National GrandMaster General is not approachable as such by any person who has not reached the VI°,except by special permission.Frater Superior (O.H.O.): Most Holy and Most Beloved Father [Mother] in theLord. The O.H.O. is not approachable as such by any person who has not reached theVIII°, except by special permission."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"O.T.O. U.S. Camp, Oasis and Lodge Master’s Handbook22For those addresses in which fraternity is not mentioned, the writer may add \"anddear Brother [Sister]\" or \"and very dear Brother [Sister]\" as his or her feelings dictate.The closing (before your signature) should be as follows: Within the V°-X°, sign\"In the Bonds of the Order,\" with such additional expressions of duty as may be suited tothe degree of the writer. For K.E.W. and all lower degrees, use \"Yours Fraternally.\"Additionally, the signature of members of the Supreme Grand Council and higher degreesis prefixed by the triple cross crosslet, or \"eleven-fold cross\" (female members of thesedegrees use the triple cross with curved crosslets). The signature of members of the VII°is prefixed by the triple cross without crosslets. The Grail Name of members of the VI° isprefixed by the Cross Paltèe. Members of the V° sign with the consonants of the nameonly.No form of address, no signature, and no closing should be used within the C.P.I.Within that degree, the writer of the letter should be indicated, if doubt exists, by someallusion in the text.A superscription should be prefixed to the letter in the following terms. For X°:\"A Petition to His Most Sacred Majesty the Supreme and Holy King Ruling in the UnitedStates of America [or name of other country] that is in the Sanctuary of the Gnosis.\" For amember of the IX°, \"To the Thrice, Holy, Thrice Illuminated and Thrice Illustrious (name)IX°. For a member of the VIII°, \"To the Perfectly Illuminated and Very Illustrious (name)VIII°. For a member of the VII°, \"To the Very Illustrious Sir Knight (name) VII°; and soon for the lesser degrees.It is not strictly necessary for any member below the X° to assume a Magical Title;however, many members prefer to use magical names or mottoes in lieu of their civilnames. To avoid confusion, the civil name should always be included in anycorrespondence addressed to Grand Lodge Headquarters. The Latin \"Frater/Soror\" is anacceptable alternative to the English \"Brother/Sister\" when magical names or mottoes areused.The Latin salutations corresponding to \"Dear Brother,\" \" Dear Sister,\" etc. are asfollows:Care FraterCara SororCari FratresCarae SororesCari Fratres et Sorores (Carae Sorores et Fratres) orCari Fratres Sororesque (Carae Sorores Fratresque)C.

The Dating System.Thelemic chronology is divided into 22-year cycles, with Year Zero beginning onthe March equinox of 1904. The notation for a Thelemic year is customarily written inupper and lower case Roman numerals, where the upper case Roman numerals indicatethe number of 22-year cycles which have been completed and the lower case Romannumerals, often written in superscript or subscript, indicate the number of the year withinits own 22-year cycle. The notation of the year often includes the prefix Anno or An.,indicating \"year.\"Here is a list of recent and oncoming Thelemic years and their correspondingcommon dates:"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"O.T.O.

The year is divided up according to theconventional divisions of the solar year, i.e., the twelve signs of the tropical Zodiac. Thesun resides in each zodiacal sign for approximately 1/12 of the solar year, or an average ofjust over 30 days. In addition, the moon, during the course of its orbit around the Earth,resides in each zodiacal sign for a period of 2 to 3 days. Therefore, the tropical zodiacalsign occupied by the sun and by the moon on the date in question are included as part ofthe formal Thelemic date (sometimes, for greater accuracy, specifying the degree positionof each). The position of the sun and moon may be determined using an ephemeris or anastrological calendar.In a formal Thelemic date notation, the days of the week are often indicated usingtheir old Latin names, which correspond to their characteristic planets, as follows:Sunday = Dies SolisMonday = Dies LunaeTuesday = Dies MartisWednesday = Dies MercuriiThursday = Dies JovisFriday = Dies VenerisSaturday = Dies SaturniiAlternatively, the Latin name of the planet may be replaced by the appropriateplanetary symbol.For convenience, the Thelemic date is usually supplemented by the conventional,secular date. Crowley adopted the English Scottish Rite usage of placing the letters \"e.v.\"(which stand for era vulgari, meaning “common era”) after the conventional date todenote that it corresponds to the \"secular\" method of reckoning. The more modern usageof “c.e.,” for “common era,” is also acceptable."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"O.T.O.
