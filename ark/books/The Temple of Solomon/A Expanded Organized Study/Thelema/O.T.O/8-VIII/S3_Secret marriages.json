Valley of Liverpool.]I[De Castitate]1 Of Chastity[Amen.] Dearly Beloved, in that war [treason] of the Brethren of theLeft Hand Path against the Gnosis whose first phase ended in theestablishment of the tyranny and superstition which is called Christianitymuch Truth was stolen by the Black Lodge, and perverted to its vile uses.And most noxious in its corruption is that castration of man called Chastity,the atrophy of those noblest parts of the body which are the proper organsof Redemption both Gaian and Ouranian.We then who in the Seventh Degree were sworn most solemnly toChastity in the Inmost as in the Outermost, who have now as Epopts of theIlluminati beheld with our eyes, and as Perfect Pontiffs of our noble Orderadministered with our members, the Initiation whose name is Resurrectionunto the light, we therefore are able to lighten the darkest places of theEarth, and to consider wisely what lieth in the empire of the Evil Ones.Read therefore these passages in the forgery called the Epistle of Paul tothe Romans:Let no sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey thelusts thereof: Neither present your members unto sin as instruments ofunrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead,and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh:for as ye presented your members as servants to uncleanness and iniquityunto iniquity, even so now present your members as servants torighteousness unto sanctification. For when ye were servants of sin, yewere free in regard of righteousness. What fruit then had ye at the time in1.Square brackets [ . . . ] denote variant text."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"285the things whereof ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things isdeath. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, yehave your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.(Romans VI, 12–13 and 19–22)Consider also these passages of the Old Testament [Jewish Legend]:[Moreover] And the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great tablet, andwrite upon it with the pen of a man, for Maher-shalal-hash-baz; And I willtake upon me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest and Zechariahthe Son of Jeberechaiah. And I went unto the prophetess and she conceivedand bare a son. Then said the Lord unto me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.(Isaiah VIII, 1–4)When the Lord spake at the first by Hosea the LORD said unto Hosea,Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredome and children of whoredome: forthe land doth commit great whoredom, departing from the LORD. So hewent and took Goher the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived and barehim a son.(Hosea I, 2–3)And the LORD said unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of herfriend and an adulteress, even as the LORD loveth the children of Israel,though they turn unto other gods, and love cakes and raisins. So I boughther to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and an homer of barley, and an halfhomer of barley: And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days;thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any man’s wife: so willI also be toward thee.(Hosea III, 1–3)It is then certain even out of the mouth of the enemy that there is asacred use, even as an abuse, of the Sanctuaries of Life, and although therebe rites so sacrosanct and so secreted that even to the Perfectly IlluminatedAdepts of the VIII° they may not be disclosed, yet to them is due a fulldeclaration of many Mysteries almost surpassing speech.II[De aliquo ritu] Of the Rites of Blood[Amen.] It is said that there is a sect of the [our] Jewish Brethren calledChassidim whose practice is the sacrifice of man. Thus preferably a child,but also an adult, is taken from among the Gentiles, and ceremonially slainso that no a drop of blood is lost, lest the spirit of the victim, taking refugein that drop, escape the Exorcist. This blood is then consumed as asacrament, or employed for talismanic purposes. For once the spirit of theslain one is sealed up into the spilt and gathered blood, it is multiplied inevery part thereof, even as in the Mass the Body of Christ is said to be"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"286equally in all the myriad consecrated hosts, and His Blood in every drop ofconsecrated wine, everywhere and for all efficacious.[III][De aliquo ritu Ecclesiae Gnosticae][Amen. It was the law in the early Christian Church, according to certainFathers of the Gnosis, to take a babe new-born, and having wrapped it in apaste of flour, to stab it in many places with the consecrated knif. Theblood of the child thus impregnating the flour with Life, the material becamesuitable for the manufacture of the Host.]Consider of this.[IV] III[De aliquo ritu in regno. Muscoviae secrete celebrato]Of Certain Rites Secretly Practised in Russia[Amen.] There is a body within the Greek Church which holds an esotericdoctrine and practises a Secret Rite.At the meetings of this body the lights being extinguished, theworshippers, led by the Priest and a chosen and consecrated Priestess, seekout each other by touch and by subtle attraction; then they consummate thepure charity [chastity] of their hearts in holy zeal.If by the favour and indwelling of the Holy Ghost the Priestess (that isunto this Rite espoused, and else virgin) do conceive and bring forth, thenis the child baptized by its father the Priest for the Purification by water,and for the Consecration by fire is roast and divided among the worshippersfor use as a sacrament, as a talisman and as a medicine against all diseases.This also is said of the Knights of our own Holy Order of the Temple, thatthe offspring of any one of them by a virgin was roast and an unguent madeof its fat wherewith to anoint the Magian and Ineffable figure of Baphomet.Consider of this.[V] IV[De Missa Diabli] Of the Black Mass[Amen.}Within the Roman Church has been found ever from thebeginning to this day, persons and societies conforming outwardly to thatbase and materialistic cult, inwardly revolting against it; yet often are suchso ignorant of our Light and of our Truth, that to them the attainment ofLife, Liberty and Love seemed only possible through a profanation of theirown Mysteries. For they knew not that these Mysteries were themselvesbut profanation and corruption of the true and perfect Mysteries of theAdepts.They established therefore a cult whose fundamental formula was thedefilement of the consecrated Host.The Priest therefore having made the bread into the Body of Christ (ashe could theoretically do by virtue of his Apostolic power) did, as he thought,defile that Body by using it as the object and vehicle of lust."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"287Heroic children of Liberty, but thrice blind! Samsons that perish withthe Philistines!For if the ecclesiastical theory be true, in fact they do incur damnation,if false, verily they lose their labour. But at least they set up Man againstthe foul demon of the Christians, and let this be accounted unto them forrighteousness. But see, my Brethren Perfectly Illuminated Adepts, howgreat is their error, that they revolt who should be Kings. For it is in truthnot the apish antics of the Priest that consecrate the bread, but his malepower that should make holy all his deeds.Consider of this.[VI] V[De Sabbato Adeptorum] Of the Sabbath of the Adepts[Amen.] In the black hours of earth, when the Christian superstitionwith fell blight withered most malignantly the people of Europe, when ourown Holy Order was dispersed and the sanctity of its preceptories lay violate,there were yet found certain to hold Truth in their hearts, and, loving Light,to bear the Lamp of Virtue beneath the Cloak of Secrecy. And these atcertain seasons went at night by ways open or hidden to heaths andmountains, and there dancing together, and with strange suppers and spellsdiverse, did call forth Him, whom the enemy called ignorantly Satan, andwas in truth the Great God Pan, or Bacchus, or even that Baphomet whomthe Templars worshipped secretly, and yet worship [( ]as in the VI° allIllustrious Knights of the Holy [Sacrosanct] Order of Kadosch, all DameCompanions of the Holy Grail are taught to do [ )] or BABALON theBeautiful, or even Zeus Apollo of the Greeks.And each when first inducted to the revel was made partner of thatIncarnate One by the Consummation of the Rite of Marriage.Consider of this.[VII] VI[De aliquibus fabulis antiquitatis] Of Classical Fables[Amen.] The Ancients of every nation report their heroes to have beenborn of the marriage of Gods with mortals. As, Romulus and Remus [twins]begotten of the God Mars upon a vestal Virgin, Hercules of Jove, Buddhaof Vishnu in the form of a white elephant with six tusks, Jesus of Jehovahupon a virgin, and many another. Even true Gods were born of mortalmothers, as Dionsius of Semele.Also they recount many loves of heaven for earth, Diana for Endymion,Zeus for Leda, Danae, Europa, and the rest; even Hades issued from hisgloomy kingdom to ravish the maid Persephone.There are also loves of Gods for nymphs, Bacchus for the Ariadne,Zeus for Io, Pan for Syrinx; there is no end of these. And Satyrs, fawns,centaurs, dryads, a thousand gracious tribes, leap lightly and lustfully throughtheir legends.Again we have the loves of fairies for mankind, and the commerce ofthe Beni Elohim with the daughters of men; and yet again the marriage of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"288Orpheus with Eruydice a nymph, and the fatal nets that Laura, Melusina,the Sirens, [Lorelei,] Lilith and many another cast for men.It is even said that to every Neophyte of the Order of A∴A∴ appearetha demon in the form of a woman to pervert him; within Our own knowledgehave not less than nine brethren been utterly cast out [away] thereby[, andthat within the space of two years].There are also vain loves, as that of Ixion for Hera, of Actaeon forArtemis.Consider of this.[VIII] VII[De Cultu antiqua apud Graecos nunc etiam semper manente]Of Certain Greek Rites[Amen.] Among the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula and especially theGreeks, beneath the bush [husk] of their false Christianity, is hidden thewheat of Demeter. And even as the Muslim trust to be united by death tothe Hur al’ Ayn [and the Gilman] of Paradise, so do these others yet thinkthat earthly marriage is but fornication, for the Death is a nuptial whereinthe soul is united to that God or Goddess to whom on earth his lust aspired.Thus, even in the embraces of their lovers, their hearts were fixed on Artemisor on Aphrodite or on Ares or on Apollo, as the inner tendency urges andthe intuition thereof proclaims.Consider of this.[IX] VIII[De succubis et incubis] Of Succubi and Incubi[Amen.] From all time the life of man has now and again overflowed,in sleep, without will, and only reflected itself dimly and fantastically bydream[s] into his knowledge. Now since naught can be lost on any plane,but only changed in appearance, the inner substance of this life-stuff doesindeed beget monsters in part material, which the doctors of the MiddleAges called Incubi or Succubi according as they performed the functionsof male or female. These, too, begat children upon women; but not thereverse, for the succubus, for all his female function, is as male as hisbrother.Of these monstrous lovers some even became famous on earth; as thatone who tempted San Antonio, and the angel that wrestled with Jacob atthe place call Paniel. Also Merlin was the child of an incubus, and thus alsowere many heroes of old time begot.Consider of this.[X] IX[De opere Adepti] Of the Work of Adepts[Amen.] Not only as a probation, and as a preparation, for the far greaterKey of Magick Art that is given to Initiates of the Sanctuary of the Gnosisin the IX°, but for its own sake, and the practical and permanent value of itseffects is a lesser work to be undertaken by Epopts — and how much moreby Pontiffs! — of the Illuminati."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"289And this work is threefold.IDevotion to the Highest intensified on all planes until it culmi-nates in Conjugal Union ratified by every God so firmly thatDeath itself is the gate to its fullest and permanent enjoyment.And the soul is to beget itself as a child for a new incarnationupon the body of the Great Goddess.

The supreme means is declared fully in the Publications of the AugustFraternity Most Holy the A∴ A∴ Liber XI and Liber DLV.2. This other method is suggested.On every occasion before sleep let the Adept figure his goddess beforehim, wooing her ardently in imagination and exalting himself with allintensity toward her.And let him consider all involuntary movements of the mind [vindu] asadulteries vile and criminal.Therefore, with or without an assistant, let him purge himself freelyand fully, at the end of restraint trained and ordered unto exhaustion,concentrating ever ardently upon the Body of the Great Goddess, and letthe Offering be preserved in Her consecrated temple or in a talismanespecially prepared for this practice. And let no desire for any other enterthe heart. Then shall it be int the end that the Great Goddess will descendand clothe Her beauty in veils of flesh, surrendering her chaste fortress ofOlympus to that assault of thee, O Titan, Son of Earth! Or at the least, thisbeing denied thee, yet all thy life in heart and spirit being Hers, thy deathshall be the consummation of these ‘betrothals’, an entry into the ClosedPalace of thy Lady.And of such Espousals mayst thou read in Liber CCCCXVIII, moreespecially in the Ninth and in the Second Aethyrs.It is to be noted in all this that both God and the Soul are male or femaleas convenience requires. See, for a curious example, the mystic treatisecalled the Bagh-i-Muattar."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"290[XII] XI[De modo operandi nuptias minores] Of Lesser Marriages[Amen.] This matter is easy, for the souls of the elements desireconstantly this salvation. But let the Adept beware:1. That he choose wisely a reasonable soul, docile, apt,beautiful, and in all ways worthy of love.2. That he fall not ever from love of the Great Goddess intolove of this inferior, but give only as master and of his pity[mercy], knowing that this also is Service to His High Ladyabove.3. That of such familiar spirits he have but four. And let himregulate their service, appointing hours for each.4. That he treat them with kindliness and firmness, being onguard against their tricks.This being said, it is enough; for to have them is but the pains to callthem forth from their homes. And the Spirits of the Elemental Tablets givenby Dr. Dee and Sir Edward Kelly are the best, being very perfect in theirnature and faithful, affectioning (sic) the human race. And if not so powerfulas, they are less dangerous than, the planetary Spirits; for these are moreboisterous, and by distraction stars are easily perturbed and afflicted. Callthem therefore by the Keys of Enoch as is written in the Book ye know of;and let there be after the Calls an evocation by the Wand; and let the Marrowof the Wand be preserved within the pyramids of the letters that make upthe name of the Spirit.Now unless ye be well skilled in Art Magick, ye will not dare call forththe Three Great Gods of the whole Tablet, or the King Serpent thereof, orthe Six Seigneurs majestical, or even the Gods of the Calvary Crosses inthe lesser angles. But the Cherubic rulers, yea verily and amen, these areyour mates; and ye may yet more safely summon the Lesser assistant angles.And those that are in this Art novices should wiselier call forth only theTrigrammaton of the Sub-Elements.[XIII] XII[De modo Creandi Nova Regna Sacta ad Gloriam.

Then shallthey conjoin, making unto themselves a new Heaven and a new Earth, whoseunion shall breed Elements, and multitudes of Beings to Live and Love inLiberty beneath thy light, an house of Virgins singing praises among theflames of Glory wherein the Lord hath opened his mouth; whose worksshall be a song of honour and the praise of your God in your creation![XIV] XIII[De perditione] Of DamnationRemember, dearly beloved, perfectly illuminated Adepts of this secretAreopagus, that from the beginning of all, the vows of your Initiation haveinvoked upon you the most fearful penalties of disobedience.For as soon as ye erect any natural and common thing into a Formula ofMagick, so soon do ye excite also the contrary current. Thus while everychild reads and speaks freely of the Pillars of the Temple of King Solomonby name, the Mason [Phremason] dare not so much as letter them withoutprecaution. And while the private man may speak evil of the King, andblaspheme God without risk, yet the servant of the King, and the Ministerof God, most cloak (sic) themselves with reverence, even though it be notin their hearts, for this reason, that they have invoked the King, and God, assword and shield of their own authority.To you, then, if you have dared to use this Force of the Holy Phallus, isits abuse fatal and deadly.To the man of earth it matters but little if he suffer nocturnal pollution,or indulge in wantonness; to you that are Adepts it is ruin absolute.For all that Force which passeth from under your control, unless sodirected and fortified by your Will that it is but as a loyal soldier faithfulunto death is as artillery abandoned that is seized upon by the enemy andturned against you. And because it is of your own substance, therefore hasit, as it were, by nature a link with you, a right upon you, and all the fortresses,that your inheritance of God, and your own Holy Art, have built about youare of no force to resist this treasonable assault. Be wary therefore, forobsession, bodily wasting and disease, madness and even murder uponyou may be inflicted by the engines that ye, having forged for the service ofmankind and for the glory of the Lord, leave to the malignancy of the demonthat he may turn them to your own destruction."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"292[XV] XIV[De oura seminis] A Reproof[Amen.]Hear then, dearly beloved, this reproof.First, strengthen to the uttermost the power of restraint by daily practiceas is taught by the Hindus and Arabs, masters of this science, in their books.Shiva SanhitaHathayoga PradipikaKama SutraAnanga RangaThe Scented Garden of the Sheikh Nefzawiand many others.Secondly, avoid the dangers of inadvertence by constant and regularpractice (a) of the Greater and (b) of the Lesser Works of an Epopt andPontiff of the Illuminati and (c) of the Mystery of the New Holy Kingdom.Thirdly, sleep always in a consecrated circle or in a room full of holyimages before whose glory the powers of darkness tremble every day.
