Popular Sun-sign astrology has become a subject for cocktail party chatter; the 'Underground press' displays an intensive, although often ill-informed, interest in such subjects as Glastonbury, Ley Hunting, and Flying Saucers; and books — many of them owing what little merit they possess to the skillful employment of scissors and paste — on all aspects of occultism pour from all the presses.In the shadow of such well-publicised aspects of the Occult revival can be dimly discerned the shape of an altogether more important phenomenon — nothing less than the rebirth of Magic. Magic, that is, in the sense that it is defined by the extraordinary occultist Dion Fortune: 'The science and art of causing changes in consciousness in accordance with will.'There is no doubt that the magical techniques, for which extraordinary efficacy is claimed, are almost exclusively derived (although sometimes indirectly) from those two extraordinary occult sodalities the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Ordo Templi Orientis. The rites and secret instructions of the former organisation are easily available in Dr, Francis Regardie's Golden Dawn, a work which only now, thirty-five years after its first publication, is beginning to receive the appreciation it so undoubtedly deserves.

At about the same time the U.S.A. entered the war on the allied side.Neither of these events greatly excited the inhabitants of Henri Oedenkoven’s and Ida Hoffmann’s eccentric vegetarian community situated at Ascona in Switzerland. They were far more interested in a bombastic encyclical just promulgated by Theodor Reuss, a temporary guest of the community.‘Let it be known’, began this manifesto, ‘that there exists, unknown to the great crowd, a very ancient Order of sages, whose object is the amelioration and spiritual evolution of mankind by means of conquering error and aiding men and women in their efforts of attaining the power of recognizing the truth. This Order has existed already in the most remote times and it has manifested its activity secretly and openly in the world under different names and in various forms: it has caused social and political revolutions and proved to be the rock of salvation in times of danger and misfortune. It has always upheld the banner of freedom against tyranny in whatever shape this appeared, whether as clerical or political or social despotism or oppression of any kind.‘To this “secret order” every wise and spiritually enlightened person belongs by right of his or her nature: because they all, even if they are personally unknown to each other, are one in their purpose and object and they all work under the guidance of the one light of truth. Into this Sacred Society no one can be admitted by another unless he has the power to enter it himself by virtue of his own interior Illumination neither can anyone after he has once entered be expelled unless he should expel himself by becoming unfaithful to his principles and forget again the truths which he has learned by his own experience.‘All this is known to every enlightened person.‘But it is known only to few that there exists also an external, visible organization of such men and women, who having themselves found the path to real self-knowledge, and who having travelled the burning sands, are willing to give to others, desirous of entering that path, the benefit of their experience, and to act as spiritual guides to those who are willing to be guided.file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c1.html (1 of 4) [12/28/2001 2:01:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.‘While numberless societies, associations, orders, groups, etc., have been founded during the last thirty years in all parts of the civilized world, all following some line of occult study, yet there is but ONE ancient organization of genuine Mystics which shows to the seeker after truth a Royal Road to discover the Lost Mysteries of Antiquity and to the Unveiling of the One Hermetic Truth.‘This organization is known at the present times (sic) as the:Ancient Order of Oriental TemplarsOrdo Templi OrientisOtherwise: The Hermetic Brotherhood of Light‘It is a Modern School of Magic. And, like the ancient schools of magic, it derived its knowledge from the East. This knowledge was never revealed to the profane, for it gave immense power for either good or evil to its possessors. It was recorded in symbol, parable and allegory, requiring a Key for its interpretation.‘The symbols and glyphs of Freemasonry were originally also derived from the more ancient mysteries.‘These symbols of ancient Masonry, of the Rosicrucians, the sacred art of the ancient Chemi (Egyptians), of Homer’s Golden Chain, like those of modern Freemasonry, etc., are however but different aspects of the One Great Mystery. They all require a key to disclose the real underlying meaning. There exists, however, but One Right Key, and moreover this one right key must be used the Right Way.‘This key can be placed within the reach of all those who are prepared unselfishly to study and work for its possession, if they apply for membership to the Order of Oriental Templars (O.T.O.).‘The O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis) is a body of Initiates in whose hands are concentrated the secret knowledge of all Oriental Orders and of all existing Masonic Degrees. Its Chiefs are Initiates of the highest rank and recognized as such by all capabel (sic) of such recognition in every country in the world. The Order is international, and has existing connections in every civilized country in the world. Every man or woman who becomes a member of the O.T.O. has an indefeasible right to the first three degrees of Masonry.‘The O.T.O., although an Academia Masonica, is not a Masonic Body, so far as the craft degrees are concerned in the sense in which that expression is usually understood in England, and therefore in no way conflicts with, or infringes the just privileges of, the United Grand Lodge of England. English Master Masons in good standing, by arrangement, on affiliation, are admitted at reduced charges. Members of the IX° become part-proprietors of the Estates and Goods of the Order.

It is made clear, for example, that the high-flown statements in the third paragraph of the manifesto referring to the ‘Sacred Society’ from which it is impossible to be expelled do not apply to the O.T.O. itself. For in Article 5, Section 4 of the Constitution it is laid down that the Outer Head of the Order ‘shall have the right to cancel or suspend the Charter of any subordinate organization ... and shall also have the right to suspend or dissolve the membership of any person whenever such action is, in his or her opinion, for the interest of the O.T.O.’After a brief synopsis of the nine degrees of the O.T.O. — of which more later — Reuss’s manifesto concluded with the following ‘message from the Master Thirion’ (sic) better known as Aleister Crowley. ‘For our great comfort it is written in the Book of the Law:Love is the Law, Love under Will‘This is to be taken as meaning that while Will is the Law, the nature of that Will is Love. But this love is as it were a by-product of that Will; it does not contradict or supersede that Will: and if apparent contradiction should arise in any crisis, it is the Will that will guide us aright. Love is easily counterfeited. Lo, while in the Book of the Law is much of Love, there is no word of Sentimentality. Hate itself is almost like Love! Fighting most certainly is Love! “As brothers fight ye!” All the manly races of the world understand this. The Love of Liber Legis is always bold, virile, ecstatic, even orgiastic. There is delicacy, but it is the delicacy of strength. Mighty and terrible and glorious as it is, however, it is but the pennon upon the sacred lance of Will, the damascened inscription upon the swords of the Knight-monks of Thelima (sic).‘It is the apotheosis of Freedom; but it is also the strictest possible bond. It is that harmony of Legis Jugum and Libertas Evangelii1 which we once saw upon the little table above the Pastos of Our Father Christian Rosencreutz.’It must be frankly recognized that almost the whole of this manifesto was intended to deceive. The majority of its readers would have assumed for example, that the mysterious ‘Master Thirion’ was either some discarnate entity, similar to those who supposedly manifested themselves to MacGregor Mathers and other members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, or a Himalayan superman, like Madame Blavatsky’s Mahatmas.2 Again, the statement that the O.T.O. ‘in no way conflicts with or infringes the just privileges of the United Grand Lodge of England’3 displayed on Reuss’s part either what Lenin, in another connection, called ‘a naivete which in a child would be touching, but is repugnant in a person of mature years’, or a capacity to tell a good, strong lie. For the O.T.O. not only had, as we shall see, connections with spurious and clandestine masonic groups but functioned as a recruiting office for one of these — for in the ‘Classification of Members by Degrees’ appended to Reuss’s document it is clearly stated that ‘candidates are made Freemasons by the Directing Members (Fratres Superiores) of the O.T.O.’.file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c1.html (3 of 4) [12/28/2001 2:01:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.Nevertheless Reuss’s 1917 manifesto is not without interest — even importance — for, while there is no need to follow Reuss in believing that the O.T.O. was the ‘ONE ancient organization of genuine Mystics’, there is no doubt that it has been one of the two most influential occult fraternities of the last century4 with some of its members playing important parts in the activities that have led to the current occult revival.file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c1.html (4 of 4) [12/28/2001 2:01:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.PART ONEThe Birth and Development of the O.T.O.*CHAPTER TWOOccult TemplarismIn spite of its importance as a mystical fraternity the origins of the O.T.O. have remained somewhat obscure. It is true that some occultists have supplied a pedigree of sorts, but without giving any evidence for their genealogical conclusions. Thus in his stimulating book The Magical Revival (Muller, 1972) Mr. Kenneth Grant has told us that ‘The true Occult Order ... numbered among its openly unavowed (sic) representatives such authorities as Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton ... Fred Hockley, Kenneth Mackenzie ... and others. Bulwer-Lytton links up historically with the continental Adepts Eliphas Lévi, Gerard Encausse (Papus), Rudolph Steiner and Franz Hartmann ... These collateral continental elements constituted what was once known as the Hermetic Brotherhood of the Light.’Mr. Grant’s last sentence is of particular significance, for it must be remembered that Reuss’s 1917 manifesto gave the O.T.O. the alternative title of Hermetic Brotherhood of Light.Such statements as that of Mr. Grant are, of course interesting but they do seem to be inherently improbable — it is most unlikely, for example, that either Bulwer-Lytton or Eliphas Lévi were either advocates or practitioners of the type of magic particularly associated with the O.T.O. — and the historian of occultism is regretfully forced to look upon them as being unsubstantiated.The real origins of the O.T.O. seem to lie in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Occult Templarism.Until towards the middle of the eighteenth century few people seem to have displayed any great interest in the original Order of the Temple, the Knights Templar, suppressed in 1314 on the grounds that its members were heretical, blasphemous and sodomitical. With the rise of continental and Anglo-Saxon freemasonry, however, the building activities of the Templars began to attract attention. Perhaps, thought some masons, the fact that the symbolism of the Craft degrees of masonry was concerned with both the building of a Temple and the murder of its architect, Hiram, suggested the existence of a connection between the Knights Templar and freemasonry? Perhaps the masonic fraternity did not, as was assumed by most of its members, go back to the time of King Solomon but was simply an underground continuation of the Order of the Temple? Perhaps the murdered Hiram was really Jacques de Molay, the martyred Grand Master of the Templars? The idea of an historical connection between masonry and the Crusading Orders received the enthusiastic support of the Chevalier Ramsay, a Jacobite exile — he was file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c2.html (1 of 5) [12/28/2001 2:01:22 PM]"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.the private tutor of the Young Pretender, Bonnie Prince Charlie — who was also an active freemason. Ramsay said:‘At the time of the Crusades in Palestine many princes, lords, and citizens associated themselves, and vowed to restore the Temple of the Christians in the Holy Land, and to employ themselves in bringing back their architecture to its first institution. They agreed upon several ancient signs and symbolic words drawn from the well of religion in order to recognize themselves amongst the heathens and Saracens. These signs and words were only communicated to those who promised solemnly, and sometimes at the foot of the altar, never to reveal them. This sacred promise was therefore not an execrable oath, as it has been called,5 but a respectable bond to unite Christians of all nationalities into one confraternity. Some time afterwards our Order formed an intimate union with the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. From that time our Lodges took the name of Lodges of St. John.’6 These and similar speculations inspired the manufacture of several spurious ‘Templar’ masonic side-degrees. The first of these was very probably the still surviving Royal Order of Scotland, organized into two degrees, that of the Royal Order of H.R.M. (Heredom) and that of the Knights of the R.S.Y.C.S. (Rosy Cross). According to the legend of this Order its origins lay in the arrival of Pierre d’Aumont and seven other Templars, refugees from persecution, in the island of Mull, situated off the coast of Scotland. The supposed incident was described, from a hostile point of view, by a member of a rival ‘Templar’ Order:‘After the death of Jacques de Molay, some Scottish Templars having become apostates at the instigation of Robert Bruce ranged themselves under the banner of a new Order instituted by this prince and in which the receptions were based on those of the Order of the Temple. It is there that we must seek the origin of Scottish Masonry and even that of the other masonic rites. The Scottish Templars were excommunicated in 1324 by Larmenius, who declared them to be Temple desertores and with the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, Dominiorum Militae spoliatores, placed for ever outside the pale of the Temple ... A similar anathema has since been launched by several Grand Masters against Templars who were rebellious to legitimate authority. From the schism that was introduced into Scotland a number of sects took birth.7The legend of Pierre d’Aumont was accepted as historical truth by many continental masonic groups, among them the French Chapter of Clermont, and it was from the ranks of the last mentioned organization that at some time between 1751 and 1754 Baron von Hund (1722-76) recruited the first members of the Stricte Observance, a quasi-Templar masonic Order which claimed to possess secret Templar documents dating back to the fourteenth century and to work under the direction of mysterious Unknown Superiors, individuals ‘irresponsible themselves but claiming absolute jurisdiction and obedience without question’.In his History of the Prussian Monarchy Mirabeau has described the first appearance of the agents of these Unknown Superiors:‘In about 1756 there appeared, as if they had sprung out of the earth, men sent, so they said, by Unknown Superiors and armed with powers to reform the Order and re-establish it in its ancient purity.

He was received in the best way in the world by the brothers who were lured by the hope of great secrets, of important discoveries which were never made known to them.’It must be added that Johnson, who claimed that he was English and that his Unknown Superiors dwelt at Aberdeen in Scotland, was, in the words of a masonic historian, ‘an unmitigated vagabond ... of almost repulsive demeanour and of no education but gifted with boundless impudence and low cunning’. No one, of course, ever encountered Johnson’s supposed chiefs, and it can reasonably be assumed that they never existed. Equally imaginary were Johnson’s supposed name and nationality; in reality he appears to have been a German Jew named either Leucht or Becker.Johnson’s pretensions were eventually exposed; he was arrested, imprisoned in the castle of Wartburg and there, shortly afterwards, he died. The Stricte Observance, however, survived and flourished. Its influence and reputation grew and it extended itself into almost every European country. In course of time however, schisms — the bane of all secret societies —arose, the Order went into decline and ultimately flickered out.In spite of its brief life the Stricte Observance was of importance for three reasons:(1) It left a permanent mark on the masonic rituals of Scandinavia.(2) Its Unknown Superiors were the forerunners of Madame Blavatsky’s Mahatmas, the Third Order of MacGregor Mathers of the Golden Dawn, and the Secret Chiefs of Aleister Crowley.(3) There seems to have been a substantial amount of cultural cross-fertilization between the Stricte Observance and the Order of Elect Cohens (Elus Coens, i.e. Chosen Priests), the first masonic association to be deeply involved in the practice of ceremonial magic.The Elect Cohens were founded by Martines de Pasqually, a somewhat mysterious figure who may have been Portuguese by nationality. It has been suggested that de Pasqually was of Jewish origin, but there is no hard evidence of this and it is clear that, nominally at least, he was a Catholic, for there is a surviving record of his son’s baptism. Nevertheless, he had undoubtedly been deeply influenced by a somewhat debased variety of Jewish mysticism, for he was a devotee of the degenerate version of qabalistic magic presented in such works as the Key of Solomon and the Sepher Ratziel.The Order of Elect Cohens was founded at Bordeaux in 1760 — six years earlier de Pasqually had unsuccessfully attempted to found an organization called the Scottish Judges which may well have been a first attempt to establish a magical/masonic link-up — and quickly acquired a surprisingly large number of initiates. The membership (confined to those who had already taken the three degrees of ordinary craft masonry) was divided into the grades of Apprentice Priest, Fellow Priest, Master Priest, Grand Architect and Grand Elect of Zerubbabel, the last mentioned degree sometimes being known as Knight of the East. Beyond these lay other, secret, degrees culminating in a Rose-Croix degree concerned file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c2.html (3 of 5) [12/28/2001 2:01:22 PM]"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.exclusively with ceremonial magic and bearing little resemblance to the Rose-Croix grade that is now the 18° of the orthodox Ancient and Accepted Rite of Freemasonry.Owing to the researches of Rene le Forestier8 we know a great deal about the nature of the ritual magic practised by de Pasqually and his disciples. The most important ceremonies took place during the first quarter of the moon and were accompanied by the use of an incense compounded of storax, olibanum, saffron, poppy seeds, agaric spores, cinnamon, nutmeg and mastic; at least two, and probably more, of these substances are possessed of hallucinogenic properties, so it is not surprising that the Elect Cohens seem to found their magic effective!The Invocation of good spirits and the exorcism of devils was an important aspect of the work of de Pasqually. Here is an extract from a magical exorcism, part of a ceremony called The Work of the Equinox: ‘I conjure you Satan, Beelzebub, Baran, Leviathan, and all of you formidable beings, beings of iniquity, confusion and abomination, hearken and tremble at my voice and commandment; all of you great and powerful demons of the four universal regions and all of you demoniacal legions, subtle spirits of confusion, horror and persecution, here my voice and tremble when it sounds amongst you and during your cursed operations; I command you by the one who has pronounced eternal death on all of you!’Martines de Pasqually died in 1774, but he continued to teach the secrets of magic to a few trusted pupils — or so one must suppose if one chooses to accept the extraordinary story told by the Abbe Fournier in his book What We Have Been, What We Are, And What We Might Become: ‘... towards ten o’clock in the evening, I being prostrated in my chamber, calling on God to assist me, suddenly heard the voice of Mr. de Pasqually, my director, who had died in the body more than two years previously. I heard him speaking distinctly outside my chamber, the door being closed, and the windows shut in like manner, the shutters also being secured. I turned in the direction of the voice, being that of the long garden belonging to the house, and thereupon I beheld M Pasqually with my eyes, who began speaking, and with him were my father and mother, both also dead in the body. God knows the terrible night which I passed!’The teachings of de Pasqually seem to have had some influence upon another Templar group, the Order of the Temple, which probably originated in the eighteenth century although its existence was not revealed until the publication of the Manuel des Chevaliers du Temple (1811) by Fabre Palaprat, who claimed to be Grand Master of the Order.The Order of the Temple saw itself as the true Church of Christ, preserving through the centuries a true ‘Egyptian Gnostic Christian’ tradition. It claimed that ‘The Son of God ... was brought up in the schools of Alexandria ... he was able to reach all the degrees of Egyptian initiation ... Jesus conferred evangelical initiation on his apostles and disciples ...’ How this mystic Christianity had supposedly passed on to the Templars was recounted in the Order’s legend: file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c2.html (4 of 5) [12/28/2001 2:01:22 PM]"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.‘Up to the year 1118 the mysteries and the hierarchic Order of the initiation of Egypt, transmitted to the Jews by Moses, then to the Christians by Jesus Christ, were preserved by the successors of St. John.

These Gnostic Christians, appreciating the courage and piety of the Templar Knights ... held it their duty to trust to hands so pure the knowledge acquired over so many centuries. ...

From him had come a line of Grand Masters under whom the Templars had survived into the nineteenth century.This preposterous nonsense was taken seriously by several nineteenth-century occultists and Eliphas Lévi asserted that Theoclet — the Gnostic pontiff who had supposedly passed on the apostolic succession to the Templars — had initiated Hugues de Payens ‘into the mysteries and hopes of his pretended Church, he lured him by the ideas of sacerdotal sovereignty and supreme royalty, he indicated him finally as his successor; so the Order of the Knights Templar was stained from its origin with schism and conspiracy against Kings!’10By the last decade of the nineteenth century certain German occultists, most of them high-grade freemasons, had been stimulated by their study of Lévi’s writings on magic to take an interest in Templarism.

He therefore decided, reasonably enough, to call his fraternity Ordo Templi Orientis — the Order of Oriental Templars — thus properly acknowledging his intellectual debts to his teachers.Whether these teachers ever actually existed, or if they did, whether they taught Kellner the things that he claimed that they taught him, is of no great importance. The fact remains that from somewhere or other this German occultist obtained the knowledge of a remarkable magical system bearing some resemblance to both Bengali Tantrism and certain highly unorthodox forms of Sufism.11It is probable that for many years the O.T.O. existed only in its founder’s imagination, for nothing seems to have been heard of it between 1895, the date of its supposed establishment, and 1904, when it began to be mentioned by name in a periodical called the Oriflamme.The Oriflamme was a supposedly masonic production, the official organ of the magnificently entitled ‘Berlin Grand Lodge of the United Grand Council of Rites of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of 33 degrees, of the Ancient Primitive Rite of Memphis of 95 degrees and the Egyptian Rite of Misraim of 90 degrees’.To understand the real nature of the Berlin Grand Lodge of Memphis and Misraim — for such is the conventional (and merciful) abbreviation of the organization’s title — it is necessary to make a brief excursion into nineteenth-century masonic history.Both the Rite of Memphis and the Rite of Misraim, originally quite separate organizations, had come into file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c3.html (1 of 3) [12/28/2001 2:01:29 PM]"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.existence at some time between 1830 and 1840.12 Neither enjoyed any great success and both eventually fell into the hands of John Yarker, an English masonic enthusiast who, after unifying them, publicized them through a periodical called The Kneph.There is no doubt that Yarker was a dedicated, even an obsessive, freemason. There is equally no doubt that his masonic activities led him to neglect his private affairs, to fall into poverty13 and, eventually, to be prepared to confer masonic charters on any individual, or group of individuals, who were prepared to pay a sufficiently large fee.In 1902 Yarker was approached by three German occultists, named Klein, Hartmann and Reuss, and on September 24 of that year he sold them a charter conferring upon them the right to establish a Berlin Grand Lodge of Memphis and Misraim. Exactly what were the motives that induced these three Germans to make their purchase is uncertain; probably it was at least partly in order to establish a profitable business in conferring masonic initiations in return for substantial sums of money — for at least two of the three, Hartmann and Reuss, seem to have been in perpetual financial difficulties.In many ways Hartmann — nicknamed ‘dirty Franz’ on account of his greasy appearance — was the most interesting of the three. Born in 1838, he had studied medicine at Munich, but in 1865, without having qualified, he had sailed to the U.S.A. as a ship’s doctor. He obtained some sort of medical qualification at St. Louis, probably at the city’s Eclectic Medical College, notorious for its low standards, and practised medicine in several different states. Apart from his frequent moves, possibly symptomatic of financial difficulties, his life seems to have been uneventful enough until his conversion to Madam Blavatsky’s Theosophy (c. 1878) and his admission to membership of the society that she had founded.Hartmann spent the years 1883-85 at the Theosophical headquarters situated at Adyar, Madras, playing a major part in the internal conflicts that almost destroyed the Society and conducting a spirited, but hopeless, defence of Madam Blavatsky against the accusations of fraud made by Madame Coulomb and her husband. Surprisingly enough, these latter efforts do not seem to have endeared the Russian seeress to her defender, for in a letter to A. P. Sinnett she wrote:‘Poor Hartmann. He is a bad lot, but would give his life to the Masters and Occultism ... but I cannot trust him.’14After his return from India in 1885 Hartmann made his living as a successful writer and lecturer on occultism and allied subjects. Nevertheless, he seems to have been regarded with great suspicion by many German Theosophists and it is significant that when the German Theosophical Society split away from the parent body in 1912 an overwhelming majority of its members followed Rudolf Steiner and not Vollrath, Hartmann’s friend and disciple.At some time before 1904 Hartmann and his associates15 must have met Kellner and become converts to his Templar magical system, for in that year the Oriflamme began to make flattering references to both the Ordo Templi Orientis and to Kellner himself. These references were frequently accompanied by file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c3.html (2 of 3) [12/28/2001 2:01:29 PM]"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.mysterious hints regarding a great secret allegedly in the possession of the O.T.O.In 1912, seven years after Kellner’s death and the succession of Reuss to the chieftainship of the O.T.O. the ‘Jubilee’ edition of the Oriflamme gave some indication of the nature of this secret:‘Our Order possesses the KEY which opens up all Masonic and Hermetic secrets, namely, the teaching of sexual magic, and this teaching explains, without exception, all the secrets of Freemasonry and all systems of religion.’file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c3.html (3 of 3) [12/28/2001 2:01:29 PM]"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.PART ONEThe Birth and Development of the O.T.O.*CHAPTER FOURReuss, Steiner and Aleister CrowleyUnder the leadership of Reuss the O.T.O. enjoyed a steady, although not spectacular, expansion. Charters were granted to various occultists outside Germany and independent national Orders, derivative of the O.T.O., were established; in France, for example Dr. Encausse, better known under his occult pseudonym of ‘Papus’, was appointed chief of both the O.T.O. and the French Rite of Memphis and Misraim.16 This close association of the O.T.O. with Memphis and Misraim seems to have been usually the case up to 1914; it is interesting to note that as late as 1927 the Danish section of the O.T.O., the Danish Rite of Memphis and Misraim, and the Danish section of AMORC (originally chartered by Reuss), all operated from the same address.One of the most interesting recruits to Memphis and Misraim was Rudolf Steiner, to whom Reuss granted a charter in 1906. The Oriflamme reported this event in the following words:‘Brother Rudolf Steiner, 33°, 95°, of Berlin, and the Brothers and Sisters associated with him have been granted permission to form a Chapter and Grand Council under the title (Mysteria) Mystica Aeterna in Berlin. Dr. Steiner has been appointed Deputy Grand Master, with jurisdiction over members already received or to be received by him ...’Mr. Ellic Howe has written17 that ‘in the absence of documentary evidence it would be unwise to try to link Steiner with Reuss’s Ordo Templi Orientis’; nevertheless, I remain confident that such a link almost certainly existed. It must be considered that:(a) Mysteria Maxima normally formed a part of the names of O.T.O. national sections — the Swiss section, for example, was Mysteria Mystica Veritas, the British section, led by Aleister Crowley, was Mysteria Mystica Maxima.(b) Women were admitted into the group led by Steiner; this would be normal in the O.T.O. but not in Memphis and Misraim.(c) By the time he came to write his autobiography Steiner was clearly ashamed of his former ritualistic file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c4.html (1 of 3) [12/28/2001 2:01:45 PM]"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.activities and devoted three pages to an attempt to explain them away. It is difficult to understand why he should have done this if he had been no more than an unorthodox freemason.(d) Crowley, who as we shall see, was on friendly terms with Reuss, specifically stated that Steiner had been an O.T.O. initiate. It is worth adding that Crowley was usually accurate on matters of fact outside his own personal affairs.(e) Dr. Felkin, the chief of the Stella Matutina (a magical fraternity derived from the Golden Dawn) and a disciple of Steiner was also a member of the British section of the O.T.O. This, of course, was led by Crowley — regarded by the Stella Matutina as a black magician. It is impossible to explain Felkin’s membership of the O.T.O., and consequent association with Crowley, except on the assumption that either Steiner or one of his German lieutenants had suggested it to him.(f) Descriptions of Steiner’s rituals published in the French press before 1914 are reminiscent of the ceremonies of the O.T.O.(g) There is some evidence that Steiner referred to his group as ‘Esoteric Rosicrucians’; this was the name given to initiates of the eighth degree of the O.T.O.Whatever the truth about Steiner’s possible membership of the O.T.O. there is no reason of course to believe that he ever practised sexual magic; indeed, the poem dedicated to Steiner by Crowley18 seems to imply that the former took the O.T.O.’s sexual magic as being no more than subtle allegory.Crowley himself seems to have been admitted to the lower grades of the O.T.O. in 1911. At the time he regarded it as no more than a simple masonic fraternity, but, in the following year, after a visit from Reuss, who accused him of revealing the innermost secrets of the Order, he changed his mind.Crowley responded to the accusation by pointing out that he was not in possession of these secrets and therefore hardly in a position to reveal them. Silently Reuss opened a copy of Crowley’s Book of Lies and pointed to a passage beginning ‘Let the Adept be armed with his Magic Rood and provided with his Mystic Rose’. In a flash Crowley understood the nature of the O.T.O. Magical system and in the conversation that followed it was agreed that he should head the British section of the O.T.O. — this, it will be remembered, was the Mysteria Mystica Maxima.Subsequently Crowley visited Berlin where he received copies of the Order’s instructional manuscripts and had the title of ‘Supreme and Holy King of Ireland, Iona and all the Britains within the Sanctuary of the Gnosis’ conferred upon him.19While Crowley was impressed with the magical teachings he received from Reuss — he found the O.T.O.’s techniques far simpler than the long-winded ceremonial methods of the Golden Dawn — Reuss seems to have been equally impressed by Crowley and, indeed, to have been converted to ‘Crowleyanity’, the new religion of Thelema.file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c4.html (2 of 3) [12/28/2001 2:01:45 PM]"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.The nature of Thelemite religion and the story of how it came into existence are now too well known for it to be worth while recounting at length. Suffice to say that in 1904 Crowley received a ‘direct voice’ communication entitled, The Book of the Law, an intensely beautiful prose-poem in three short chapters purporting to give an initiated interpretation of the new Aeon of Horus, or, as it is now often called, the ‘Age of Aquarius’.20Under Crowley’s influence the rituals of the O.T.O. were revised in order to conform to the Book of the Law; simultaneously Crowley produced the Gnostic Mass (for both the O.T.O. and Reuss’s Gnostic Catholic Church) and, at Reuss’s request, revised some of the O.T.O. instructional material pertaining to the ninth degree.21Reuss resigned his chieftainship of the O.T.O. in 1922 — he had suffered a stroke some two years earlier — verbally nominating Crowley his successor. It was not until 1925, however, that a majority of the German O.T.O. accepted Crowley’s leadership, and even then a substantial minority of its Lodges continued to reject both Crowley and the Book of the Law. In 1937 both groups of magicians were suppressed by the Nazis.For the next ten years California was the main centre of O.T.O. activity and at the time of Crowley’s death in 1947 there was no real organized O.T.O. activity outside the U.S.A.22file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c4.html (3 of 3) [12/28/2001 2:01:45 PM]"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.PART ONEThe Birth and Development of the O.T.O.*CHAPTER FIVEThe O.T.O. since Crowley’s Death23After Crowley’s death, Karl Germer, who was born in 1885, became the Outer Head of the Order — that is to say, the Chief (on the plane of Earth) of the O.T.O.Germer was devoted to both Thelema and to Crowley himself and he did everything in his power to revive the order. In these efforts he was only partially successful, for his difficult temperament upset many of those who might otherwise have become his allies. Nevertheless his good business sense not only saved the O.T.O. from a threatened extinction, but enabled him to publish some of Crowley’s works (e.g. The Book of Wisdom and Folly) — for Germer, as Grand Treasurer of the O.T.O. had inherited the Crowley copyrights. This may surprise some people, for there is a widely held belief that these copyrights were inherited by Louis Wilkinson and John Symonds. This was not so; Louis Wilkinson and John Symonds were Crowley’s literary executors, entrusted with the duty of gathering together all monies earned by Crowley’s literary works, and handing them to Karl Germer. They performed these duties admirably, with no reward and little thanks, as is shown by the duplicate copies of the receipts issued by Germer.Germer died in 1962 leaving the Crowley copyright to ‘the O.T.O.’. Unfortunately he failed to say which of the many scattered groups claiming to be the O.T.O. he regarded as being genuine. There are just four of these groups whose claims to O.T.O. status are worthy of examination. They are:(a) The O.T.O. in Switzerland headed by Frater Paragranus.(b) The O.T.O. in California, U.S.A.(c) ‘Saturn Gnosis’ O.T.O. in Germany, led until his death by, ‘Gregor A Gregorius’.(d) The O.T.O. in England led by Kenneth Grant.Before dealing with (a) and (b) in detail I shall briefly discount the claims of (c) and (d).file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c5.html (1 of 3) [12/28/2001 2:01:50 PM]"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.‘Saturn Gnosis’ was founded (c. 1927) by ‘Gregor A. Gregorius’, whose real name was Eugen Grosche. Along with other German magical groups it was suppressed in 1937, but was revived in 1950 by its founder, who was also the publisher of a periodical entitled, Blätter fur Lebenskunst. Grosche claimed to be a Thelemite, and frequently expressed his admiration for Crowley. His claims, however, were not taken seriously by Germer, who wrote: ‘Grosche’s manipulations are beginning to become more suspicious. In the June issue of his Blätter fur Lebenskunst he prints a childish report of Crowley — Therion, makes him even obtain an audience with the Dalai Lama and other silly things. In the July issue he discloses his game, or the game of those occult forces behind him, more openly. He talks of, “Thelemists” while, “Thelemites” should be and always has been, “Thelemiten”. The foremost law of the “Thelemists” will be, “Thou shalt not kill,” — cf. Liber OZ! I have no idea of the origin of the “thelemistic Revelations” from which he quotes (p. 5) the verses VI. 6, 10, 11 and 12. And then again later, III. 6, 7 and on p. 7 VI. 2, 3. It reads, to me, at least, like the style of the so-called Mahatma letters. ... Magically I see it as the deliberate attempts by the Black Lodge, or whatever lodge, to throw a stick into the wheel of our new serious beginning ... Grosche wants to make himself the spokesman for Thelema in Germany. It may be a deliberate attempt to draw the wind from our sails. It will not succeed, but shows to what current he belongs.’This quotation makes clear that when he left the Crowley copyrights to the O.T.O. Germer did not have Grosche’s movement in mind. In an action held in the German Courts some years ago Grosche failed to establish his claim to be the chief of a section of the authentic O.T.O.Eugen Grosche was on friendly terms with Kenneth Grant whose claim to be Outer Head of the Order has been made on the dustjackets of Crowley’s Confessions, the Magical Record of the Beast 666, and Kenneth Grant’s own, The Magical Revival. Nevertheless Germer expelled Kenneth Grant from the O.T.O. on July 20, 1955. An account of this expulsion is given in Rites of Modern Occult Magic by Francis King and I can confirm that this account is correct. I have in my possession a signed copy of one of the duplicate copies of the Notice of Expulsion sent out by Germer.It is clear then that the group led by Grant was not intended to benefit under Germer’s Will either.The claims of the Californian O.T.O. also seem doubtful. Its leader, Grady McMurtry, rests his claim upon two letters from Crowley. The first appointed him as, ‘our personal representative in the United States of America ... subject to the approval ... of ... Karl Johannes Germer’. The second authorized McMurtry, ‘... to reform the whole organism ... subject to the approval of Frater Saturnus.’24 This seems definite enough, but there is no real evidence that Germer ever gave his approval, nor, in his Will, did he mention Grady McMurtry by name.The strongest claim seems to be that of Mystica Maxima Veritas, the O.T.O. in Switzerland led by Frater Paragranus. Germer held Paragranus in some regard and wrote of him: ‘The man who, as far as I can see, is chosen for a great and growing job.’ Even so, the Swiss O.T.O. has also failed to sustain its claim to authentic O.T.O. status in the law courts.file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c5.html (2 of 3) [12/28/2001 2:01:50 PM]"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.My conclusion is that no group can establish any legal claim to be the O.T.O.

It is likely, however, that it was very similar to that outlined in the constitution promulgated from London by Reuss on January 22 ‘in the year of the Order 788’.25According to this members of the O.T.O. were classified as follows:‘(a) Probationers (embracing Theosophists etc);(b) Students or Lay Brothers (Masonic Members);(c) Initiates, or O.T.O. Members proper.’An expansion of this rather skeletonic system was given in the ‘Synopsis of Degrees’ attached to the manifesto of 191726 (see table below).At some time subsequent to 1917 certain radical modifications were made to this system; these seem to have been made on the basis of suggestions made by Aleister Crowley. The nature of these amendments will become apparent upon examination of the rituals that form Part II of this book — it will be seen that, for example, a new, un-numbered degree (0°) has been added and that this has been given the name of Minerval, formerly the name of the second degree.Degree Masonic Equivalent (if any) and Classification Course of Instruction1° Probationer2° Minerval Novices Preliminary state of Preparation.file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p1c6.html (1 of 2) [12/28/2001 2:02:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.3° Craft of Masonry Entered Apprentice Fellow Craft Master Mason Full instruction in Craft Masonry, including the Catechism of the first three degrees, and an explanation of all the various masonic systems.4° Scotch Masonry Scotch Mason Knight of St. AndrewRoyal Arch Students or Lay Brothers Full instruction in the Scottish degrees of Ancient and Accepted Masonry.5° Rose-Croix Knight of Rose-Croix Knight of Pelican Knight of East and West Esoteric instruction and introductory remarks on the passing into Rosicrucianism and Hermetic Science.6° Historical Templar Knight Kadosh Grand Inspector General A full History of the Templars and their ceremonies.7° Mystic Templar (Colour Violet) Mystic Masonry Theoreticus Magus of Light Grand Master of Light General theoretical studies of the O.T.O. magical system.8° Oriental Templar (Colour White) Esoteric Rosicrucianism Practicus Adeptus Princeps Illuminatus Practices that taught in seventh degree.

A little before dawn, they again met at the Well, to report the result of their search.Worthy Wazir, have you sought to the North of the Well?W.: I have.S.: What did you find?W.: No trace of Our Brother.S.: Noble Emir, have you sought to the East of the Well?E.: I have.S.: What did you find?E.: No trace of Our Brother.S.: Worthy Wazir, have you sought to the South of the Well?W.: I have.S.: What did you find?W.: No trace of Our Brother.S.: Noble Emir, have you sought to the West of the Well?E.: I have.S.: What did you find?E.: No trace of Our Brother.S.: Then let us seek him within the Well itself.file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael...Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p2c4.html (13 of 19) [12/28/2001 2:03:21 PM]"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.(They raise the coping stone.)S.: Brethren, the Master is slain, yet his Word lives, for here, behold is written in his blood, upon the floor of this dry well, ‘An’el Haqq’, which is to say, ‘I am the Truth’, Noble Emir, do you know the Word by which man is raised from death to life?E.: I do.S.: Make trial of that Word.(Word of First.)E.: The Word is in vain.(Repeat with W. and Word of Second.)E.: Shall nothing endure but the Truth?W.: Will you not make trial of the Word of a Master Magician?S.: It is my will.(W. and E. take C. from Well and support him.)I am bound to Our Brother by Seven Bonds of Brotherhood.My hand gripped his in sure relation.(Point by point done as said.)As of true brother with true brother;My foot was ever firm foundationOf our straight walking with each other;My knee bent not in supplicationEither to him or to another.file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael...Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p2c4.html (14 of 19) [12/28/2001 2:03:21 PM]"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.My body did not do him wrong;My bosom kept his secrets close;My mouth spoke forth his truth in song;My arm his warden from his foes.E.: And do these bonds endure through time?S.: Noble Emir, they do.W.: How so?S.: By virtue of the word of a Master Magician.The first letter is of silence.(Pause.)The second is of breath ...Our Brother breathes.The third letter is of going ...Our brother moves.The fourth letter is of generation.Our brother stands rejoicing.(Word.)All: He lives in the son.(O.T.O. applause.

Advance to me as a Magician.(Done.)You will now take a third step as before, with the left foot; for Three represents the return of the Two to the One, but after another manner. And herein lieth a great Mystery, beyond the understanding even of a Master Magician.It is in this position that the Secrets of this Degree are communicated.They consist of a Sign, a Grip and a Word. As in the First Degree, the sign was single, in the Second double, so in the Third Degree it is triple.FIRST, is the Sign of Mystery. Clenching the fingers of the right hand, touch with the thumb, the forehead, the right breast, the left breast and finally the throat. This is in commemoration of the wounds of the Ancient Master, and by their position they form a triangle with a point in the focus thereof, which is called CENTRUM IN TRIGONO CENTRI.SECOND is the Sign of Resurrection. Clenching the right hand as usual, touch the navel with the thumb. Then draw the hand sharply across the body, and drop it smartly to the side; then bring it upwards with a curving motion, slowly, to the navel. This sign demands a word, and this word is AN’EL HAQQ. The other replies: I am the Truth and within my Turban is wrapped nothing but God.THIRD is the Sign of Brotherhood; which includes the Grip. This is given by approaching with clenched hands, backs upwards, and then reciprocally grasping the thumbs. Three distinct pressures are then given. One says:‘I give my hand in sure relation.’The other answers:‘As of true brother with true brother.’Approach the feet, so that the right foot of each is between the two feet of the other. One says:‘I pledge my foot for firm foundation.’file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael...Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p2c4.html (16 of 19) [12/28/2001 2:03:21 PM]"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.The other answers:‘Of our straight walking with each other.’Touch the right knees and say together:‘My knees bend not in supplicationEither to you or to another’.Advancing the lower part of the torso, say:‘My body doth not do you wrong.’The other, advancing the breast, replies:‘My bosom keeps your secrets close.’The first, putting his mouth to the other’s ear:‘My mouth speaks to you, truth in song.’The second, putting his mouth to the ear of the first, while both throw the left arm over the back of the other:‘My arm defends you from your foes.’This Sign and Grip combined, demands a Word. It is the Word by which I raised you, the Word by which we triumph over death. This word is too sacred to utter on any other occasion; and you will therefore say instead of it, a sentence whose initials are formed from the letters of the Word taken in reverse order: This sentence is ..., which means:Now is the blessing of Death at hand.Be seated, Brother Master Magician, in the throne of the Most Mysterious Master of the Secret Place of Masters.(Done.)S.: I am now to impress upon you the Nature of the Bonds which link the Brethren of this Degree.

The union of bodies signifies that the use of the bodily functions shall be such as to bring no grief to any Brother Master Magician, or to them of his household; but rather freedom in rejoicing. The union of breasts implies the unison of the hearts of all True Brethren, the love that inspires them, and the sanctity of the confidence between them. The union of mouths affirms that Master Magicians will speak the truth one to another and one of another; while the arm thrown over the back of a brother asserts that each will guard the other in his absence as in his presence, and defend his honour as if it were his own. In particular he is to be at pains to repel the slanderer of his Brother’s good name, informing that Brother immediately of the name of his Slanderer, and the matter of the slander, and not allowing himself to be tricked into a pledge of secrecy. I ask you, Brother Master Magician, if you clearly understand, and heartily agree, these principles?C.: (With sign.) I do.E.: It now becomes my duty to inform you that the ceremony through which you have just passed, is in every essential the Lesser or Infernal Rite of the Slain God, whose name is John, or some sound similar, as Jonah, Dionysus, Janus, Dianus, Nu, Anu, Oannes, On, Noah, and many others. This God of Water is of the North, because the Sun touches his Northern limit as he enters the watery sign Cancer, and turns towards the South, represented by the Goat-Gods, Set, Had, Hades, Adad, Odin, Adonis, Adonii, Atys, etc., who are of the earthly sign Capricornus, the southern limit of the Sun’s journey. As the end of Summer is in Libra, the cardinal sign of air, the Gods of Water partake also of the airy nature, and similarly, the Earthy Gods have their natures intermixed with fire, since the end of Winter announces the fiery sign of Aries, whose mysteries are those of Spring and called the Greater Mysteries, wherein the Slain God is celebrated by his name Iao, Jupiter, Jehovah, Iacchis, Zeus, Shu, Jesus, Osiris, etc. The ignorance of the vulgar and the corruption of the records have aided Time’s work of confusing the doctrines, so that the natures of distinct Gods have suffered the accretion of alien elements till their simplicity has almost baffled restoration.This Infernal Rite, of which you are now an initiate, is founded on the apparent tragedy of the fall of the year, seen as a catastrophe by ignorant minds, though the philosophical comprehend the phenomenon as the natural, regular and recurrent change in the obliquity of the Earth’s Axis. With this ceremony of the renewal of the life of the Sun, is mingled that of what the wise men of old regarded as a similar tragedy, that of the death of man and his renewal ‘in the son’. Let me ask you to consider, Brother Master Magician, that as the solar tragedy is but the uninformed and partial views of acts, so may the human prove. Of this your progress in Our Order may give you opportunity to judge.W.: (To S.) Most Mysterious Master of the Time past, will you not bequeath to your successor a double portion of your spirit, and bestow upon him from the shades a mark of your divine favour?file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael...Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p2c4.html (18 of 19) [12/28/2001 2:03:21 PM]"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.S.: It is my will.(Gives C. his insignia, and affixes O.T.O.)(Places candle in his hand.)W.: (To C.)

If you understand that word, you will be indeed able to say: ‘Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?’ not merely with triumph, but with contempt, such as may have been felt of old by a faithful knight who, dressed in the armour of his monarch, was slain in mistake for him.If you have not understood that word, these expressions will appear strange to you. In either case, it is merely necessary that you should know that while the word of that degree sums up human nature, the word of this degree is the synthesis of the divine.Man is the microcosm, a perfect mirror of that universe for which one name is God.file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael...Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p2c5.html (18 of 22) [12/28/2001 2:03:44 PM]"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.The word upon the altar is then a hieroglyph of the microcosm; and all its secrets are therein contained.IIAccordingly, we find the word of a Minerval once more in the very centre of all, and you will recollect that this word ON means the Sun.However, this is not all. ON in Hebrew is a most secret and holy name of God: its numerical value is 120, a number produced by multiplying together the first five numbers, or by adding together the first 15. This 15 again is produced by adding the first 5. There are many other important considerations to be made concerning this word and this number, which may safely be left to the ardours of your research. This Sun is in the midst of the 6 other letters of the word; and the general knowledge of correspondences which you have derived from the study of the books appointed for your instruction will at once show you thatJ is Virgo the Virgin MoonA is the Fool or Antic, the antique or ancient one SaturnH is the letter of Aries the house of MarsB is the letter of MercuryV is the Hierophant or Pope, emblem of JupiterL is Libra the house of VenusSuch, my brother, are the letters taken singly. In combination we reach beyond the simple facts of nature to divine mysteries.IIIFirst of all, consider the descending triangle. It reads IHV, the first three letters of the ineffable name of four letters. They refer to Father, Mother, Son, as your earliest studies in the Qabalah acquainted you. You will compare this with the word of the 3°. It is further of the very greatest importance to remember that the three principal officers of the Royal Arch represent the three functions of Prophet, Priest, and King. Now in the Tarot J. is the Hermit, the ‘Prophet of the Eternal’; H. is the Emperor, and V. the Hierophant, Pope, or High Priest.Now the left side of the Triangle L.J.A. = 41 = Ma the Mother, while A.I.L. means a stag, goat, or ram, from the curved horns of those animals, and therefore means the Father, and ‘the Beginning of Whirling file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael...Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p2c5.html (19 of 22) [12/28/2001 2:03:44 PM]"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.Motion’. God, says Proclus, is he having a spiral force. The right side A.H.B. means ‘love’.The base B.V.L. means ‘on high’.In all, ‘the love of the supernal mother-father’.You will further recognize in J.A.H. a name of God so sacred that the Hebrews dared not utter it, and dare not to this day. It represents the Father and Mother conjoined with the Microcosm represented by the letter A whose shape suggests the Pentagram, the star of the Microcosm contained in that conjunction. H.B.V. adds to 13 and thus expresses both Unity and Love, while V.L.J. is 46, a female slave, here referring to the unenlightened soul.Combining all this into a single sentence, we read: the Most High by Love and Unity exalts the Daughter to the throne of the Mother. That is a pure rendering of the way of salvation by Samadhi or Union with God, in that particular image which you have studied in ‘The Vision and the Voice’. Taking the name by syllables, we find Jah as before ‘The Most High’. Bul means ‘Lord’ and also ‘on high’ in the Chaldean Language, while ON in Egyptian and Hebrew alike signifies the Sun, the Lord of all. Thus in three separate languages the Word testifies to the True and Living God Most High.IVWe shall now consider the word, taking two letters at a time from the angles of the triangle.We saw that the descending triangle IHV expressed the human nature of God; the ascending triangle will illustrate His nature in itself.AB is Father, BL Lord.AL is Word or Logos, Son, BL Lord.LB is Heart or Spirit, BL Lord.vvvv (All rise.) Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost; as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world end. Amen.(Sign of admiration.)Thus my brother, does the Word of this degree declare the nature of the most Holy Trinity.So much, perhaps, you were already aware of; for none can be more sensible than myself of the progress you have made; yet it may possibly have escaped you that these same letters can be read in a sense file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael...Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p2c5.html (20 of 22) [12/28/2001 2:03:44 PM]"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.diametrically opposite to the first.Thus, AB the Father, BA to come or go denies the permanence of the Father.LA Not BL God.

The Heart is Lord.The first of these phrases would seem to emphasize the lesson of the 3°; the second, to make a statement contradicting the very word in which it occurs, surprising until you recollect the statement in The Vision and the Voice that above the Abyss a fact is only true in so far as it contradicts itself; while the third is another way of saying:Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law: and this:The word of the Law is Thelema.And this: Love is the Law, Love under Will.Do not forget that the numeration of Thelema, as also that of Agape, Love or Charity in its best sense, is equivalent to that of the word of our 3°.It is further of interest to observe that these letters ABL added to 33, the number of the years of the life of King Solomon’s Temple, and that of Jesus Christ. 33 is also the number of degrees in Freemasonry; and it has many other qualities, many of which you doubtless know already.Note, too, that A is 1, B 2, L 30, as if to signify the whole course of the universe, the Unity, the Dyad, the Many and the Naught.It is also pertinent to observe that J is the Wand, A the Pentagram or Pentacle, H the Cup, B the Crown, V the Sword, and L the Balances, while O and N symbolize other magical weapons of a still more secret and important character.VBut it would be useless to continue an analysis of a Word which includes all things human and divine, and in which every secret is concealed. Is not the wealth of the Divine inexhaustible? Can the square define the Illimitable, or the Compasses circumscribe Him? Unbegotten in Eternity, beyond Time and Space, without quantity or quality, sublime, supreme, inaccessible, unknown, with what words shall we praise, or with what thoughts comprehend His Majesty? Utterance must profane Him, silence itself can but bear witness to Him. How shall we extol Him? In what shall we shadow forth His glory?

He is also sole giver of Light in a certain secret sense not fully declared in the VII°.

Nor are ye wholly ignorant of how in the Figure called Baphomet and Babalon is a Measure of Heaven and Earth.Again, those, Initiates indeed, who have penetrated in truth into the Sanctuaries of their own Being, and found That God Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent who is Light, Life, Love, and Liberty, beyond Time and Space, without quantity or quality, One Eternal, the very essence of the Sun and of the Phallus alike, will possess in their own consciousness, illuminated by That, a certain apprehension of the Truth which is not in any way to be shared by those who have not attained to this Treasure.These, if they are wise, will make no attempt to disclose this inner Truth to the profane, but will be content that they rest in the shadow of that external Truth which We have here declared unto you, that God is One, and that His name is in the Macrocosm the Sun, and in the Microcosm the Phallus.For all attempts to initiate even the worthy before they initiate themselves are folly and fatality.

How then to mere Knights Kadosch, to Sovereign Princes of Rose Croix? And how to Master Masons?

And the First Word as the last is ON, the Sun.But were the Minerval to suspect this truth, would he not turn to flee in terror from the Camp and be cut down by the Black Guard that wardeth even the outmost marches of the Kingdom of the Most Holy and Most High Lord God Almighty?Therefore, reflect, act wisely and with prudence, Sir Knights, not declaring openly the Arcanum to such as understand not already of their own ripe wit.

It is easy to prove that the Sun is indeed the source of Life and Light, that the Phallus is indeed PANGENETOR. But to those who have stultified themselves, who have darkened their own eyes, who have betrayed their own reason in seeking out phantastic gods, foul and tangled cobwebs of metaphysic spun by emasculate spider-professors in sunless cloisters, bubbles blown by idiots and madmen, myths misinterpreted, fables taken for history, lies pushed forward by every forgery, fraud, treachery and murder, to such the Truth seems false, and the Light darkness.Such Gods as Parabrahman merely bewilder the people, and render them the prey of priestcraft, while the Christs of the Latin, Lutheran and Anglican Churches alike are but the machine-gods of all fraud and oppression, being stolen and prostituted from that Christ in whom our Fathers in the Gnosis strove to synthesize the warring gods of Syria, Greece, Chaldea, Rome and Egypt at the time when the growth of the Roman Empire first made travel and the intercommunication of the priests of Mithras, Adonis, Attis, Osiris, Dionysius, Isis, Astarte, Venus and many scores of others possible.Traces of this recension are still visible in the Mass and in the Calendar of the Saints, all gods and goddesses of universal import receiving the same honour by the same rites as before, while the local gods were replaced by saints, virgins, martyrs, or angels, often of the same name, always of the same character.Thus on the altar the Solar-phallic Crucifix is surrounded by six lights for the planets, to use one example only of a hundred at Our disposal; and Christmas is at the winter Solstice, the birth of Christ put for the birth of the Sun.

And ye have verily reason from the crowns of your heads to the soles of your feet to remember how this is the origin of all our tragedy. Thus therefore, Sir Knights valorous and noble, war constantly on all tyranny and superstition, and mostly against bigotries such as ‘orthodox’ Christianity as interpreted in its material sense, old wives’ tales and foolish fables, the immoral doctrines of original sin and vicarious atonement, and the most hideous eschatology in the history of false religion. Nor can much less be averred against all other orthodoxies, with their fables equally absurd, their postulates equally immoral.But also let there be war upon those who seek to refine upon these bigotries in any other way than that of eclectic and syncretistic harmonizations; beware moreover of those who seek to ‘spiritualize’ their false gods, for their heads are even as vain pigs’ bladders of poisonous miasma.But in your warfare honour brave antagonists; spare them, and bring them to initiation; while the hag and the eunuch — and such are well nigh all who support orthodoxies — must be shown the only mercy possible, that of swift destruction.For those calling themselves orthodox who are yet men, and women, have in truth no faith in these follies, but only profess them as convenient means of dominating the vulgar. Such are already of us, although they know it not; such, albeit unconsciously, understand and live according to our Law of THELEMA — DO WHAT THOU WILT.

Thus shall it be a storehouse of strength, and a focus or magnet, drawing to itself all subtle forces, and radiating benediction.Let then the Knight keep secret this devotion, and enjoy its fruits in quiet.VIHere also is a deeper worship and an inner, that lieth nigher to the heart of God.Let the good Knight devout appoint a secret shrine in his own body, in the brain, or in the throat, or in the heart, or in the solar plexus, or in that place called groin, or in some other centre of force, and there let him establish firmly a mental image of the Phallus or of the Sun; and, closing all avenues of sense, as it were tyling the lodge, let him worship and cherish that image with unwearying care. Let him rehearse before the Lord thus exalted his own deed of knightly devoir unto that Lord, so that Memory and Imagination dance about him as maids about the Maypole. And to these let him add Will, consecrating himself with oaths to the service of the Lord, and vowing to make himself a worthy priest unto Him. Thus, then, the whole thought being closely knit together and ranged about the Image, as soldiers that rally to a Standard, let him turn devoutly and intensely his mind to the sole contemplation of that Image, figuring to himself that all other thoughts are but as cowans and eavesdroppers. Now then, for a season shall it be difficult rightly to tyle that Lodge, and the mind shall turn ever from the Image. So therefore let the good Knight with fortitude redouble zeal, until it be that on a sudden all that turmoil cease, and the thought flow evenly up to the image. Then shall the God appear in all His glory, assuming the worshipper into His Heaven.VIIBe it known unto you, Very Illustrious Sir Knights Councillors, that there lieth beyond all this a supreme mode by which God not only manifesteth Himself to man, but is with him united in most sweet nuptials.

Thus preferably a child, but also an adult, is taken from among the Gentiles, and ceremonially slain so that not a drop of blood is lost, lest the spirit of the victim, taking refuge in that drop, escape the Exorcist. This blood is then consumed as a sacrament, or employed for talismanic purposes. For once the spirit of the slain one is sealed up into the spilt and gathered blood, it is multiplied in every part thereof, even as in the Mass the Body of Christ is said to be equally in all the myriad consecrated hosts, and His Blood in every drop of consecrated wine, everywhere and for all efficacious.Consider this.IIIOf Certain Rites Secretly Practised in RussiaThere is a body within the Greek Church which holds an esoteric doctrine and practises a Secret Rite.At the meetings of this body the lights being extinguished, the worshippers, led by the Priest and a chosen and consecrated Priestess, seek out each other by touch and by subtle attraction; then they consummate the pure charity of their hearts in holy zeal.If by the favour and indwelling of the Holy Ghost the Priestess (that is unto this Rite espoused, and else virgin) do conceive and bring forth, then is the child baptized by its father the Priest for the Purification by water, and for the Consecration by fire is roast and divided among the worshippers for use as a sacrament, as a talisman and as a medicine against all diseases. This also is said of the Knights of our own Holy Order of the Temple, that the offspring of any one of them by a virgin was roast and an unguent made of its fat wherewith to anoint the Magian and Ineffable figure of BAPHOMET.Consider this.IVOf the Black Massfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p3c2.html (3 of 12) [12/28/2001 2:05:25 PM]"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.Within the Roman Church have been found ever from the beginning to this day, persons and societies conforming outwardly to that base and materialistic cult, inwardly revolting against it; yet often are such so ignorant of our Light and of our Truth, that to them the attainment of Life, Liberty and Love seemed only possible through a profanation of their own Mysteries. For they knew not that these Mysteries were themselves but profanation and corruption of the true and perfect Mysteries of the Adepts.They established therefore a cult whose fundamental formula was the defilement of the consecrated Host.The Priest therefore having made the bread into the Body of Christ (as he could theoretically do by virtue of his Apostolic power) did, as he thought, defile that Body by using it as the object and vehicle of lust.Heroic children of Liberty, but thrice blind! Samsons that perish with the Philistines!For if the ecclesiastical theory be true, in fact they do incur damnation, if false, verily they lose their labour. But at least they set up Man against the foul demon of the Christians, and let this be accounted unto them for righteousness. But see, my Brethren Perfectly Illuminated Adepts, how great is their error, that they revolt who should be Kings. For it is in truth not the apish antics of the Priest that consecrate the bread, but his male power that should make holy all his deeds.Consider of this.VOf the Sabbath of the AdeptsIn the black hours of earth, when the Christian superstition with fell blight withered most malignantly the peoples of Europe, when our own Holy Order was dispersed and the sanctity of its preceptories lay violate, there were yet found certain to hold Truth in their hearts, and, loving Light, to bear the Lamp of Virtue beneath the Cloak of Secrecy. And these at certain seasons went at night by ways open or hidden to heaths and mountains, and there dancing together, and with strange suppers and spells diverse, did call forth Him, whom the enemy called ignorantly Satan, and was in truth the Great God Pan, or Bacchus, or even that Baphomet whom the Templars worshipped secretly, and yet worship as in the VI° all Illustrious Knights of the Holy Order of Kadosch, all Dame Companions of the Holy Grail are taught to do, or BABALON the Beautiful, or even Zeus Apollo of the Greeks.And each when first inducted to the revel was made partner of that Incarnate One by the Consummation of the Rite of Marriage.Consider of this.file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p3c2.html (4 of 12) [12/28/2001 2:05:25 PM]"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.VIOf Classical FablesThe Ancients of every nation report their heroes to have been born of the marriage of Gods with mortals.

Even true Gods were born of mortal mothers, as Dionysius of Semele.Also they recount many loves of heaven for earth, Diana for Endymion, Zeus for Leda, Danae, Europa, and the rest; even Hades issued from his gloomy kingdom to ravish the maid Persephone.There are also loves of Gods for nymphs, Bacchus for the Ariadne, Zeus for Io, Pan for Syrinx; there is no end of these. And satyrs, fawns, centaurs, dryads, a thousand gracious tribes, leap lightly and lustfully through their legends.Again we have the loves of fairies for mankind, and the commerce of the Beni Elohim with the daughters of men; and yet again the marriage of Orpheus with Eurydice a nymph, and the fatal nets that Laura, Melusina, the Sirens, Lilith and many another cast for men.It is even said that to every Neophyte of the Order of A\\A\\ appeareth a demon in the form of a woman to pervert him; within Our own knowledge have not less than nine brethren been utterly cast out thereby.There are also vain loves, as that of Ixion for Hera, of Actaeon for Artemis.Consider of this.VIIOf Certain Greek RitesAmong the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula and especially the Greeks, beneath the bush of their false Christianity, is hidden the wheat of Demeter. And even as the Muslim trust to be united by death to the Hur al’ Ayn of Paradise, so do these others yet think that earthly marriage is but fornication, for that Death is a nuptial wherein the soul is united to that God or Goddess to whom on earth his lust aspired. Thus, even in the embraces of their lovers, their hearts were fixed on Artemis or on Aphrodite or on Ares or on Apollo, as the inner tendency urges and the intuition thereof proclaims.Consider of this.VIIIfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p3c2.html (5 of 12) [12/28/2001 2:05:25 PM]"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.Of Succubi and IncubiFrom all time the life of man has now and again overflowed, in sleep, without will, and only reflected itself dimly and fantastically by dream into his knowledge. Now since naught can be lost on any plane, but only changed in appearance, the inner substance of this life-stuff does indeed beget monsters in part material, which the doctors of the Middle Ages called Incubi or Succubi according as they performed the functions of male or female. These, too, begat children upon women; but not the reverse, for the succubus, for all his female function, is as male as his brother. Of these monstrous lovers some even became famous on earth; as that one who tempted San Antonio, and the angel that wrestled with Jacob at the place called Paniel. Also Merlin was the child of an incubus, and thus also were many heroes of old time begot.Consider of this.IXOf the Work of AdeptsNot only as a probation, and as a preparation, for the far greater Key of Magick Art that is given to Initiates of the Sanctuary of the Gnosis in the IX°, but for its own sake, and the practical and permanent value of its effects is a lesser work to be undertaken by Epopts — and how much more by Pontiffs! — of the Illuminati.And this work is threefold.I. Devotion to the Highest intensified on all planes until it culminates in Conjugal Union ratified by every God so firmly that Death itself is the gate to its fullest and permanent enjoyment.And the soul is to beget itself as a child for a new incarnation upon the Body of the Great Goddess. As it is written, so be it spoken unto you! ‘O thou who hast formulated thy father and made fertile thy mother!’II. Acceptance of the devotion of a lower or partial being such as a nymph or elemental in such wise that it is thereby redeemed and made a perfect soul through the death which it must pay as the price of union with man.III.

I sent forth issue as Shu, I poured myself out as Tefnut: from one God I was three Gods....’Thus then did the Sun formulate Male and Female, whose children are Earth and Heaven, whose children are the Five Elements or Tatwas, of which all visible things are made.Let then the Adept make two talismans, pure Male and Female, with no admixture of any lesser principles; and let him consecrate himself as the Sun, and pour out Life upon them, vivifying them therewith.

And because it is of your own substance, therefore has it, as it were, by nature a link with you, a right upon you, and all the fortresses, that your inheritance of God, and your own Holy Art, have built about you are of no force to resist this treasonable assault.

The homunculus is a living being in form resembling man, and possessing those qualities of man which distinguish him from beasts, namely intellect and power of speech, but neither begotten and born after the manner of human generation, nor inhabited by a human soul.2. Thus, supposing that the re-incarnating Ego enters the foetus at the third month of gestation, it would not serve to remove such foetus from the mother, and cause it to live; for it is already human. But a foetus of two months might become homunculus.3. A human being can only become homunculus if obsessed by a demon to such an extent that the human soul is irrevocably expelled to the same degree as in death, and freed utterly so that it seeks a new tenement, and is cut off absolutely from the old. But even this, rare as it must be except in lunacy, involves an extension of the natural meaning of the term homunculus.4. In the third chapter we discuss Our method of producing that which, if not a true homunculus, at least serves all proper purposes thereunto pertinent.file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p3c4.html (1 of 5) [12/28/2001 2:05:49 PM]"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.CAPITULUM SECUNDUM1. The classical method of making the homunculus is to take the fertilized ova of a woman and to reproduce as closely as may be, without the uterus, the normal conditions of gestation therein.2. For: in the case of ectopic gestation, it is clearly possible for the ovum to develop for a considerable period; and a child of 4½ months weighing nine ounces, has been known to live for over an hour after delivery. These considerations encourage us. Life is indefinitely adaptable, and life originally appeared in a planet bacteriologically sterilized by temperatures of many thousands of degrees Centigrade. There is therefore every reason to hope that, starting as we do with the proper First Matter, we may be able to devise conditions of its growth in a ‘culture’, just as we have done in the case of the simpler organisms.As it is written ‘With God all things are possible’; and is not our Motto ‘Deus est Homo’?3. The White Tincture of the Alchemists was in this connection a replica of the Liqor Amnii, and their Red Tincture a substitute for Blood.4. Certain truly magical aids to the physiological experiments indicated above have always been held worthy. The Adept must, however, be left to devise these, as in so small a treatise we have no place for a subject so starry vast as this.CAPITULUM TERTIUM1. We assume that Our Brethren have well studied Our Epistle De Arte Magica Secundum Ritum Gradus Nonae O.T.O. k.t.l.2. Before introducing our own method of making the homunculus, let us refer to (A) the theory of Incarnation and (B) the method of Evocation invented by us in An VI Sol in Aries (April 1910 E.V.).AFor about three months the foetus is empty of any soul. It then attracts an Ego of such a nature as (a) its own Karma i.e. naturae and tendency, and (b) the Karma of the Ego, combine to make viable. If a suitable combination is not found, the result is either miscarriage, still-birth or the birth of an idiot.In the last case the foetus has been obsessed by some dumb non-human spirit, or by some human spirit of exceptional Karma. By Karma We mean always nature and tendency, and no more, although we use these words in a large sense to include all causes moral as well as physical. But we include not any conceptions of ‘Justice’ and the like in these.If this be accepted, then clearly it is possible that a magician might find means (a) to bar the gate against any Human Ego, and (b) to cause the Incarnation of some non-human being, such as an elemental or file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p3c4.html (2 of 5) [12/28/2001 2:05:49 PM]"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.planetary spirit, of a nature fitted to some desired end.

Thus if the babe that is to be were by reason of physical heredity sluggish, melancholy and weak, it would be but nugatory to invoke into it a spirit of Nakhiel or Raphael or Haniel or Anael.BThe human soul is all but inexpugnable; yet We have succeeded in the temporary expulsion of a weak and wandering soul, and its replacement. For example, We once supplanted the soul of a Caliban-creature, a certain deformed and filthy abortion without moral character, named Victor Neuburg, by a soul of Isis, by a soul of Mars and by a soul of Jupiter in turn, so that this quasi-human shape, not being a poet, did yet write verses goodly and great in praise of Isis; and not being a prophet, did yet foretell most accurately the wars which even now devastate the earth; and not being generous or wealthy did yet for a season support many dependants on his bounty.And this we did with no elaboration of thought, no Persian apparatus, no weariness or trouble at all.Now then do We mark down the Means devised by Us Baphomet for the making of the homunculus.ITake a suitable woman willing to aid thee in this Work. Explain to her fully the precautions to be taken and the manner of life necessary. Let her horoscope be, if possible, suited to the nature of the homunculus proposed; as, to have an incarnate Spirit of Benevolence let Jupiter be rising in Pisces with good aspects of Sol, Venus, and Luna; and with no notable contrary dispositions; or so far as may be possible.IITake now a man suitable; if convenient, thyself or some other Brother Initiate of the Gnosis; and so far as may be, let his horoscope also harmonize with the nature of the work.IIILet the man and woman copulate continuously (but especially at times astrologically favourable to thy working) and that in a ceremonial manner in a prepared temple, whose particular arrangement and decoration is also suitable to thy work. And let them will ardently and constantly the success of thy work denying all other desires. Thus proceed until impregnation results.file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Michael/...0Secret%20Rituals%20of%20the%20O.T.O/p3c4.html (3 of 5) [12/28/2001 2:05:49 PM]"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.IVNow let the woman be withdrawn and carried away to a place prepared.And this place should be a great desert; for in such do rarely wander any human souls seeking incarnation.Further let a great circle be drawn and consecrated to the sphere of the work; and let banishing formulae of the Sephiroth, and especially of Kether, be done often, even unto five or seven times on every day.
