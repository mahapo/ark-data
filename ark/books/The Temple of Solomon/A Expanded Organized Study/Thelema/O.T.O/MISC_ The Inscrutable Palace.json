It has been suggested that Crowley designed the degree as a counterpoint to the IXº of that same Order. Enough has been written on the IXº to suggest that it is both a powerful sex magical working and formula between a man and a woman. This piece is an ever-evolving work to include as much information concerning the XIº as can be found. There is much to be discovered and several pieces of interest that are as of yet to be included. There is a great deal to be assumed to date and over time these assumptions can be turned to either fact or fiction by the revelations to come. It has been said that there are those ...who state that Crowley gave up on the eleventh degree in his later years, that this also is contradicted by written evidence left us by both Crowley himself and his associates. My apologies if the current Grand Treasurer General of Ordo Templi Orientis takes this personally. Rather it was the ninth degree that he finally let lapse from his life. In addition to Frater L.T. and a host of others, there was Mohamahd Ibn Rahman (see the dedication to Crowley's play The Scorpion) with whom he spent his later years almost exclusively receiving the Sacrament of Shiraz. Also it was with or during the Opus with Mohamahd that his first genuine hallucination (I use his own words) or elemental manifestation, or visible contact with the Secret Chiefs [...] occurred. All of this has been, as I have said, documented. Some people I suppose just like to read those things they already think.(1) It seems that various individuals and even the Order itself have filled the history of the XIº with misunderstanding, blinds, and animosity. In an attempt to fill in the blanks, I have collected as much information as I can find into one location. There is not a lot of information to begin with. What little information is found is assumed from the chicken scratch for rituals that Crowley left, the reading between the lines of various articles and footnotes Crowley used to blind the reality of this degree, and the research of others in this field. Most have assumed that the XIº was homosexual in nature, that it was sex magick performed between two men in some manner analogous to the male/female partnership of the IXº. I submit that the XIº goes beyond such gender identification and has, in fact, several modes of operation. I submit that it is most definitely a subversive formula that breaks down the very foundations of our normal social interactions. I submit that if the XIº OTO were to come to light in the honesty of Crowley's intentions, the results would be found within these pages with less ambiguity. I submit that while the practices may be sexual in nature, the formula of the degree is beyond sexuality and holds fast to and provides the method behind the claim of OTO of \"a Secret capable of realizing the world-old dream of the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Brotherhood of Man.\" I submit that there is another formula as yet unknown that complements what is known and it is my desire to someday reveal that formula as I have the one in these pages. This said I submit for review the following information without prejudice to my own opinions. It attempts to document the known writings on the subject of the formula as well as provide the background for a revival of this formula in its original form. It collects material from Crowley as well as from others that succeeded him and their attempts to understand this elusive degree. I am convinced that the XIº does indeed exists outside the regular \"order\" of things in the OTO structure and that any attempt to regulate it brings it into the initiatory structure and defeats the purpose of the degree itself. In order for the XIº to contain the revolutionary formula it must be subversive and lofty, for in the XIº is found the true secret of the Order and the realization of True Brotherhood. Historical Information (Crowley) Crowley wrote very little concerning this degree explicitly. The rituals that exist are mere fluff to the real work. The Paris Working, for instance, may well be an XIº working, but it reveals nothing of the formula itself. It has been suggested that there are diary entries from Crowley that give more details but these have yet to be released for examination. What does surface eventually will be included here for examination. Rumour has it that his comments extend to a mixed gender working of the formula. There is also rumour of more specific degree documents for this degree in existence. The sum total of Crowley's comments (found to date) that are in reference to this degree are as follows. The Tower Card, from the Book of Thoth Tarot Atu XVI: The Tower From Liber 111, The Book of Wisdom or Folly "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" De Arcano Nefando.(2) O my Son, learn this concerning Magick, that the Yang moveth, and thus giveth itself up Eternally; but the Yin moveth not, seeking ever to enclose or restrict, reproducing in its own likeness what Impressions soever it made thereon, yet without Surrender. Now the Tao absorbeth all without Reproduction; so then let the Yang turn thereto, and not unto the Yin. And that thou mayst understand this, I say: It is a Mystery of O.T.O. For the Sun ariseth not and entereth to strike upon the High Altar of the Minster by the Great Western Gates, but by the Rose Oriel doth he make Way and Progress in His Pageant. O my Son, the Doors of Silver are wide open, and they tempt thee with their Beauty: but by the narrow Portal of Pure Gold shalt thou come nobly to thy Sanctuary. Behold! Thou knowest not how perfect is this Magick; it is the dearest-bought and holiest of our Arcana. What then is like unto my Love toward Thee, that bestoweth upon thee this Treasure of my Wisdom? My Son, neglect it not; for it is the Exorcism of Exorcisms, and the Enchantment of Enchantments. De Formula Tota.(3) Here then is the Schedule for all the Operations of Magick. First: thou shalt discover thy true Will, as I have already taught thee, and that Bud thereof which is the Purpose of this Operation. Next, formulate this Bud-Will as a Person, seeking or constructing it, and naming it according to thine Holy Qabalah, and its infallible Rule of Truth. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Third: purify and consecrate this Person, concentrating upon him and against all else. This Preparation shall continue in all thy daily Life. Mark well, make ready a new Child immediately after every Birth. Fourth: make an especial and direct Invocation at thy Mass, before the Introit, formulating a visible Image of this Child, and offering the Right of Incarnation. Fifth: perform the Mass, not omitting the Epiklesis, and let there be a Golden Wedding Ring at the Marriage of thy Lion with thine Eagle. Sixth: at the Consumption of the Eucharist accept this Child, losing thy Consciousness in him, until he be well assimilated with thee. Now then do this continuously, for by Repetition cometh forth both Strength and Skill, and the Effect is cumulative, if thou allow no Time to dissipate itself. De Formula Feminae.(4) Now this is the right Power and Property of a Woman, to arrange and to adjust all Things that exist in their proper Sphere, but not to create or to transcend. Therefore in all practical Matters is she of Might and of Wit to produce an Effect consonant with her Mood. And her Symbol is Water, that seeketh the Level, whether for Wrath, eating away the Mountains (yet even in this making smooth the Plains) or for Love, in Fecundity of Earth. But it is the Fire of Man that hath heaved up those Mountains, in huge Turmoil. Man them maketh Mischief and Trouble by his Violence, be his Will convenient to His Environment, or antipathetic; but Woman disturbeth by Manipulation, adroit or sinister as her Mood may be of Order or of Disorder. For any Man to meddle in her Affair is Folly, for he comprehendeth not Quiet; so also for her to emulate him in his Office is Fatuity. Therefore in Magick though a Woman excel all men in every Quality that is profitable for her for Attainment, yet she is Naught in that Work, even as a Man without Hands in the Shop of a Carpenter; for She hath not the Organism that might make Use of this Opportunity. Of all this is she aware by her Instinct, for her Nature is to Understand, even without Knowledge; and if thou doubt herein the Wisdom of thy Sire, do thou seek out a Woman (but with Precaution) and affirm these my Words. So shall she wax woundily wrath, and look grisly upon thee, proclaiming in a shrill Voice her manifold Excellences, which she hath, and concern the Matter not a Whit. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"De Oculo Hoor.(5) I say furthermore that this Path is of the Circle, and of the Eye of Horus that sleepeth not, but is vigilant. The Circle is all-perfect, equal every Way, but the Vesica hath bitter Need, and seeketh thy Medicine, that is of right compounded for High Purpose, to ease her Infirmity. Thus is thy Will frustrated, and thy Mind distracted, and thy Work lamed, if it be not brought to Naught. Also thy Puissance in thine Art is minished, by a full Moiety, as I do esteem it. But the Eye of Horus hath no Need, and is free in his Will, not seeking a Level, or requiring a Medicine, and is fit and worthy to be the Companion and the Ally of thee in thy Work, as a Friend to thee, not Mistress and not Slave, that seek ever with Slyness and Deceit to encompass their own Ends. There is moreover a Reason in Physics for my Word; study thou this matter in the Laws of the Changes of Nature. For Things Unlike do in their Marriage produce a Child which is relatively Stable, and resisteth Change; but Things like increase mutually the Potential of their particular Natures. Howbeit, each Path hath his own Use; and thou, being instructed in all Ways, choose thine with Discretion. From Liber 4, Magick (Chapter IV) The Formula Of Alhim, And That Of Alim. “ALHIM”, (Elohim) is the exoteric word for Gods.(6) It is the masculine plural of a feminine noun, but its nature is principally feminine.(7) It is a perfect hieroglyph of the number 5. This should be studied in “A Note on Genesis.” The Elements are all represented, as in Tetragrammaton, but there is no development from one into the others. They are, as it were, thrown together -untamed, only sympathising by virtue of their wild and stormy but elastically resistless energy. The Central letter is “He” -the letter of breath- and represents Spirit. The first letter “Aleph” is the natural letter of Air, and the Final “Mem” is the natural letter of Water. Together, “Aleph” and “Mem” make “Am” -the mother within whose womb the Cosmos is conceived. But “Yod” is not the natural letter of Fire. Its juxtaposition with “He” sanctifies that fire to the “Yod” of Tetragrammaton. Similarly we find “Lamed” for Earth, where we should expect Tau -in order to emphasize the influence of Venus, who rules Libra. “ALHIM”, therefore, represents rather the formula of Consecration than that of a complete ceremony. It is the breath of benediction, yet so potent that it can give life to clay and light to darkness."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" In consecrating a weapon, “Aleph” is the whirling force of the thunderbolt, the lightning which flameth out of the East even into the West. This is the gift of the wielding of the thunderbolt of Zeus or Indra, the god of Air. “Lamed” is the Ox-goad, the driving force; and it is also the Balance, representing the truth and love of the Magician. It is the loving care which he bestows upon perfecting his instruments, and the equilibration of that fierce force which initiates the ceremony.(8) “Yod” is the creative energy -the procreative power: and yet “Yod” is the solitude and silence of the hermitage into which the Magician has shut himself. “Mem” is the letter of water, and it is the Mem final, whose long flat lines suggest the Sea at Peace m(final); not the ordinary (initial and medial) Mem whose hieroglyph is a wave m.(9) And then, in the Centre of all, broods Spirit, which combines the mildness of the Lamb with the horns of the Ram, and is the letter of Bacchus or “Christ”.(10) After the magician has created his instrument, and balanced it truly, and filled it with the lightnings of his Will, then is the weapon laid away to rest; and in this Silence, a true Consecration comes. The Formula Of Alim It is extremely interesting to contrast with the above the formula of the elemental Gods deprived of the creative spirit. One might suppose that as ALIM, is the masculine plural of the masculine noun AL, its formula would be more virile than that of ALHIM, which is the masculine plural of the feminine noun ALH. A moment's investigation is sufficient to dissipate the illusion. The word masculine has no meaning except in relation to some feminine correlative. The word ALIM may in fact be considered as neuter. By a rather absurd convention, neuter objects are treated as feminine on account of their superficial resemblance in passivity and inertness with the unfertilized female. But the female produces life by the intervention of the male, while the neuter does so only when impregnated by Spirit. Thus we find the feminine AMA, becoming AIMA,(11) through the operation of the phallic Yod, while ALIM, the congress of dead elements, only fructifies by the brooding of Spirit. This being so, how can we describe ALIM as containing a Magical Formula? Inquiry discloses the fact that this formula is of a very special kind."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" The word adds up to 81, which is a number of the moon. It is thus the formula of witchcraft, which is under Hecate.(12) It is only the romantic mediaeval perversion of science that represents young women as partaking in witchcraft, which is, properly speaking, restricted to the use of such women as are no longer women in the Magical sense of the word, because thy are no longer capable of corresponding to the formula of the male, and are therefore neuter rather than feminine. It is for this reason that their method has always been referred to the moon, in that sense of the term in which she appears, not as the feminine correlative of the sun, but as the burnt-out, dead, airless satellite of earth. No true Magical operation can be performed by the formula of ALIM. All the works of witchcraft are illusory; and their apparent effects depend on the idea that it is possible to alter things by the mere rearrangement of them. One must not rely upon the false analogy of the Xylenes to rebut this argument. It is quite true that geometrical isomers act in different manners towards the substance to which they are brought into relation. And it is of course necessary sometimes to rearrange the elements of a molecule before that molecule can form either the masculine or the feminine element in a true Magical combination with some other molecule. It is therefore occasionally inevitable for a Magician to reorganize the structure of certain elements before proceeding to his operation proper. Although such work is technically witchcraft, it must not be regarded as undesirable on that ground, for all operations which do not transmute matter fall strictly speaking under this heading. The real objection to this formula is not inherent in its own nature. Witchcraft consists in treating it as the exclusive preoccupation of Magick, and especially in denying to the Holy Spirit his right to indwell His Temple.(13) From Liber 418, The Vision and The Voice The Cry of the 16th Aethyr, Which is Called LEA(14) There are faint and flickering images in a misty landscape, all very transient. But the general impression is of moonrise at midnight, and a crowned virgin riding upon a bull.(15) And they come up into the surface of the stone.

And now there are Angels, walking up and down in the stone. They are the Angels of the Holy Sevenfold Table. It seems that they are waiting for the Angel of the Aethyr to come forth. Now at last he appears in the gloom. He is a mighty King,(17) with crown and orb and sceptre, and his robes are of purple and gold. And he casts down the orb and sceptre to the earth, and he tears off his crown, and throws it on the ground, and tramples it. And he tears out his hair, that is of ruddy gold tinged with silver, and he plucks at his beard, and cries with as terrible voice: Woe unto me that am cast down from my place by the might of the new Aeon.

The “fool” is the Fool of the Tarot, whose number is 0, but refers the letter Aleph, 1."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"A fool's knot is a kind of knot which, although it has the appearance of a knot, is not really a knot, but pulls out immediately. The chapter consists of a series of complicated puns on 1 and I, with regard to their shape, sound, and that of the figures which resemble them in shape. Paragraph 1 calls upon the Fool of the Tarot, who is to be referred to Ipsissimus, to the pure fool, Parsifal, to resolve this problem. The word Naught-y suggests not only that the problem is sexual, but does not really exist. Paragraph 2 shows the Lingam and Yoni as, in conjunction, the foundation of ecstasy ((I)!), and of the complete symbol I A O. The latter sentence of the paragraph unites the two meanings of giving up the Lingam to the Yoni, and the Ego to the Absolute. This idea, “I must give up”, I owe, is naturally completed by I pay, and the sound of the word “pay” suggest the Hebrew letter Pe (see Liber XVI), which represents the final dissolution in Shivadarshana. In Hebrew, the letter which follows O is P; it therefore follows Ayin, the Devil of the Tarot. AYIN is spelt O I N, thus replacing the A in A I N by an O, the letter of the Devil, or Pan, the phallic God. Now AIN means nothing, and thus the replacing of AIN by OIN means the completion of the Yoni by the Lingam, which is followed by the complete dissolution symbolised in the letter P. These letters, O P, are then seen to be the root of opus, the Latin word for “work”, in this case, the Great Work. And they also begin the word “opening”. In Hindu philosophy, it is said that Shiva, the Destroyer, is asleep, and that when he opens his eye the universe is destroyed another synonym, therefore, for the accomplishment of the Great Work. But the “eye” of Shiva is also his Lingam. Shiva is himself the Mahalingam, which unites these symbolisms. The opening of the eye, the ejaculation of the lingam, the destruction of the universe, the accomplishment of the Great Work -all these are different ways of saying the same thing. The last paragraph is even obscurer to those unfamiliar to the masterpiece referred to in the note; for the eye of Horus (see 777, Col. XXI, line 10, “the blind eye that weeps” is a poetic Arab name for the lingam)."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The doctrine is that the Great Work should be accomplished without creating new Karma, for the letter N, the fish, the vesica, the womb, breeds, whereas the Eye of Horus does not; or, if it does so, breeds, according to Turkish tradition, a Messiah. Death implies resurrection; the illusion is reborn, as the Scythe of Death in the Tarot has a crosspiece. This is in connection with the Hindu doctrine, expressed in their injunction, “Fry your seeds”. Act so as to balance your past Karma, and create no new, so that, as it were, the books are balanced. While you have either a credit or a debit, you are still in account with the universe. (N.B. Frater P. wrote this chapter (61) while dining with friends, in about a minute and a half. That is how you must know the Qabalah.) From De Arte Magica (Chapter XI) Of Certain Rites Analogous To That Of The IX° It is said by certain Initiates that to obtain Spiritual gifts, and to aid Nature, the Sacrament should be as it were a Nuptial of the Folk of Earth; but that Magick is of the Demon, and that by a certain Perversion of the Office, may be created Elementals fit to perform the Will of the Magician. Now herein is a difficulty, since in this case the Matter of the Sacrament cannot exist, for that there is no White Eagle to generate the Gluten. Howbeit, We hold that in this rite is great efficacy; it may be that for certain operations it is equal or superior to that explained to Initiates of the IX°. But We hold that in this case the Priest must be an Initiate, for that it is his will which determineth the magical character of his Lion; so that if he hath no purpose but that of the goddess Adonai he cannot raise agape to her Lord Thelema, nor will the Intention of the Priestess, although a lofty Initiate, replace this essential Power of the Priest over that of which he is but the vehicle and guardian. For this reason the Ninth degree is not so easy to be made effective by Woman initiates. Of what may be the result of a development parallel to that indicated above among the Noble and Chaste Ladies of the Order, it is at present impossible for Us to declare; but a priori it seems that, though the Lion and the Eagle are best in combination, the Lion is more likely to be able to"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"dispense with the assistance of the Eagle, than the Eagle to make shift in the absence of the Lion. For the Gluten is but a menstruum or solvent, and containeth nothing in itself. The tradition also of certain lesser initiations confirmeth this. Yet considerations of divinity and of philosophy, and even of physics, do assure that our Way excelleth others even as spring tides exceed the neap. Water burneth the skin not at all, and the Oil of Vitriol but slowly but add a drop of water to the drop of Oil, and instantly cometh Heat and a pang intense and sharp. This is but analogy, yet just, and pleasing to the philosopher. From Liber Agape Tractate Of The Great Thing Hidden In The Palace Of The King Be it now understood further concerning the interchange of opposites, that albeit Man is active and Woman passive, yet Man is Peace and Woman Power. And this is called the Hermetic Paradox; and he that hath ears to hear, let him hear. There is therefore one magick act that leadeth into life, another that abutteth upon death. And the first ultimateth (sic) and the second returneth unto itself. Yet therefore is the last perfect, a true rite of the Highest, too exalted for the vulgar even of our holy and illuminated brethren. And in its profanation it cometh forth from the demon and is manifested in all uncleanness, even as it is written Demon est Deus Inversus. Yet is it, albeit limited and unable to proceed from life to life, the highest of all means of Grace, for as wine is to water so is it unto the others in its exaltation of the soul of man; and whoso mastereth the same, even he is found worthy of rule. This was the secret of the strength of our Grand Master Caius Julius Caesar, this of our brother Richard Wagner that was Grand Organist in Bavaria, and of so many others, whose fame is eternal without our Order as within, that they are as the Stars of heaven for multitude and glory. To this aspire ye above all things; for the True Light abideth therein yet more intensely than in the Other. For he that reverseth the whirlings of matter is greater than he that worketh in them. Woe therefore, woe exceeding, unto him if failing in strength he be swept away into the abyss! Awake, my Lords, be vigilant, be stern, be austere, be on your guard: for they that seek to devour you are about the gate! But of all this it is not here written: this is the Book of the Pathway that leadeth unto Life.

They satisfy the ideal of chastity by urging their pupils to see, grasp and hold a sympathetic male friend, who might be a comrade and an example, fulfilling the spiritual, mental and moral needs, yet no less apt to the aesthetic and erotic passions. We find the “beloved” disciple throughout all noble races of mankind. Even among the Jew, we read of David and Jonathan, Jesus and John. The Buddha found this friend in Ananda, Krishna, in Arjuna. Greek and Roman legend and history are full of such stories, from Apollo and Hyacinth, Marsyas and Olympus, Hercules and Hylas, Socrates and Alcibiades, Damon and Pythias, down to Hadrian and Antinous. Even in Christian times, Paul that spirit took no hurt from flesh when they were harmonized by the kiss of Timothy. It was only in the Dark Ages that corruption and vice, loathing innocence, and the prostitute took revenge on her rival, dragging decency down to her dirt. Only with the Renaissance of Learning and Art does Beauty rekindle the torch of this chaste Cupid; its fire lights the altars of Love, where stand such Priests and Leonardo, Michael Angelo, Benvenuto Cellini and Aretino. The blaze is borne even to Britain, where Marlowe, Shakespeare, and many others –another hymn their lovers, one as peers and one as Will.

The Cabalistic teachings as to the Name Jehovah, and the precautions taken by many primitive tribes to prevent a man’s ‘Name’ being discovered by his ill-wishers. The ‘Child’ of such love is, a third person, an Holy Spirit, so to speak, partaking of both natures, yet boundless and impersonal because it is a bodiless creation of wholly divine nature.

I have excerpted what I feel is relevant from both the written papers as well as The Magical Record Of Meithras XIº. From a letter by Patrick King Liber Qadosh 66 Under the Seal of the X1° INSERO INREGIA REX LEONINUS SERPENS ECSTASIS INEXSTINCTIO ELATIO VOLLUPTARIA MERTHRAS. O Which all tends to the total absorption of the forces of thine operation.

Excerpts From The Magical Record Of Meithras XIº(68) Comment on the sexual methods of Taoist alchemy: They deny the fundamental thesis of the Black Lodge (read Christian) that the sexual impulse is the source of sin and is of Satan (it is - but not as they understand it). On the contrary, they recognize it as the source of vitality and life, the root of the living principle -the TAO. That they devote this energy entirely to mystical ends is their own affair, but perhaps limits the possibilities inherent in the system. It should be noted that the method of the O.T.O. is high treason to the Chinese technique (at least in the Outer). I remain true to their principles while transcending them in the mode of my experiments. The secret of their reconciliation is simply that I dedicate my energies to a further goal –the involvement and elevation of my total being into Godhood. I may absorb the substance of the life force via many channels. I may send it forth as a star, always retaining the vital link between it and myself. I may become absorbed within it. I may simplify or complicate its implications within and/or without myself, as my will directs. Thus the Thelemic conception transcends even the TAO, or more correctly the Chinese conception of the TAO, in that we recognize the secret of retaining the \"vital breath\" even while letting it go.(69) More on oriental sexual mysticism -the Chinese sex alchemy, in that branch which actually allows intercourse, conceive of the TAO as being made up of the interplay between yin and yang forces, female and male. Adepts engage in epic battles of mammoth proportions to obtain the yin or"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"yang of their respective partners. It is, for instance, permissible to give a little yang for a great deal more yin, and vice/versa. The obvious connection between sexuality and vampirism is thus explicitly acknowledged within the Chinese system (see the Space Vampires by Colin Wilson). Crowley would use this formulae to drain off excess sexual energies in certain individuals, the effect being purely beneficial to the person concerned while increasing his own quanta of force. That a cosmology such as the above actually exists is certainly no more strange (and I might add a good deal more healthy) than the morbid hold Christianity exercises on the nervous constitutions of thousands. Certain Hindu tantric cults undoubtedly utilize their time in similar fashion. The 5 Ms are to a degree dependent upon the retention of the \"vital light,\" preventing the immortal seed from escape and so create a new karma. The Tibetan Vajrayana Yoga reflects the forces within upon the inner screen of Buddha consciousness, and they are absorbed within the Dharmakaya or clear light of uncreated mind. The Chinese versions I can only attribute to the peculiarity of their nations evolution for more than 3000 years. Perhaps they have been influenced by Confucian and militaristic Buddhist thought. If so then this would explain the blind spot in their Taoism. Note -the secret of the O.T.O. goes far in the direction of unifying all previous magical systems. It is a lens through which practically any formulae may be employed in an immediate & convenient form. It also offers a rational method that all men and women may readily accept equally regardless of the religious or cosmological setting they may be working in. However it is my contention that only a Thelemite may draw the full measure from this holy and sacred chalice, capturing that flame of gnosis so cherished therein as a child or world of the future. Anyone not fully in tune with their own inner god and hidden goals, i.e. their true wills, would of necessity be divided and compromised by the technique. On the other hand, experimentally inculcated workings with stars who are as of yet still shrouded in mystery from their own light, whatever the nature of the shroud, should be encouraged and are an Object in themselves. In this way we are saved from the devastating error of turning the entire thing into some new superstition or another. Such words as the many used above do no service if they are interpretations which fundamentally mislead -\"spiritual, sacred, holy, secret, science, supreme\"- all of these may be correctly employed in describing Our method, all may also become the source of new error. In fact, now that I come to contemplate it -there is nothing especially \"sacred\" about it, at least no more so than any other facet of the life process- the secret resumes the life process and the life process consumes and/or conceals the secret. There is no difference in the final analysis. The technique would then seem to be a sort of \"Bohemian handling of the symbols\" -A Bohemia Esoterica to coin a phrase.

I will leave it to you my dear and enlightened brothers to decide ! Discussing with 359 the possibilities of 561 and the advent of the Rite of Mitylene under the auspices of MARASHTI XI Degree O.T.O. My lips are sealed forever more. The basic idea of this journal being an appendix to the XIth degree instruction papers, Liber Qadosh, which is quite short and to the proverbial point as to the procedure in acting out any given opus. (There is also my comment on this Liber in the possession of Frater Sub Rosa in NYC) The general idea would then be to record as faithfully and as completely as possible my work in the gnosis, a series of strange and subtle points that may arise in working the current of the XIth degree and complementary formulae here it illuminates our own. Then to make copies available to initiates of the Sovereign Sanctuary of the O.T.O., Rite of Shiraz -and as the actual method itself is nowhere revealed herein, to other chosen candidates and even members of the ninth degree of proven worth. All of these things require discretion as well as tact. I shall proceed as the moment may dictate . XIth degree Applied within the proper circumstances, in the proper manner, and to the proper individual -thus- when fully and duly performed upon the essentially prepared personage of the candidate, it takes him beyond his previously acknowledged limits. Any form of congress other than the usually accepted action tends toward a higher plane. The energy denied realization on one level, inevitably does so upon another. Thus it is perversion taken to its nth possible degree that results in constant mutation or initiation to the Highest Power. Thus it is the truly supreme formulae of magick. This is so, no matter what intellectual conception one has. Anybody who has once been righteously fucked up the ass can never again deny the very real and significant knowledge gained therefrom. Just suppose then it is not the dumb beast of man, but rather the radiant ray of some Leoninus Serpens that thus invades one's being -charged mightily with the image of Will or the eidolon of God - what then could not be accomplished in such an Operation ?!. It is of the members of the Rite of Shiraz, the initiates of the Sanctuary of the Gnosis that I ask above all others to assist me in this task of bringing scientific methods to apply in our workings with the essential formulae of the O.T.O. through which we possess an energy subtler than any yet known to man. It is of them that I ask at once the most sympathetic co-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"operation and the most complete analytical scepticism in the study of this record. This Childe is as of now but barely born. Of the six members of Our Rite but a few have attempted a systematic investigation into the possibilities of the XIth degree even as skeletal as this. Part of the problem no doubt lies with the fact that the nature of the energies involved are of an exceedingly intimate character and not easily verbalized except in some sort of alchemical, Crowleyian, almost religious garb. This sort of thing is fine where it tends toward any sort of actual work, where it tends towards stupid repetition of the sex life of Aleister Crowley it must be thrown out the window in no short order. 93! I understand that yet another instruction of the gnosis exists. It is known as the \"Sign of the Seal of Hermes\" penned by Crowley with the idea in mind to observe the critical points of success in the performance of the IXth degree. This is a curious document in that I do not believe that even the Caliphate is in possession of a copy. The especial records dealing specifically with the magick of the higher grades written by Crowley include :Liber Agape', De Arte Magica, Ninth Degree Emblems and Mode of Use, The Elixir of Life, Liber 36, Chapter 61 of Liber 333, Bagh-I-Muattar, Opus Lutetianum, Grimmorioum Sanctissimi and actually quite a few others that do not come immediately to mind. In addition to these there are also several instructions from the Order of the Shining Star that may be employed after this fashion. Personally I would place Liber Samekh prime amongst them. In cross referencing these documents (should you be so fortunate as to possess any or all of them) the actual working method should become quite plain. The Secret of the O.T.O. presupposes a basic understanding of magical principles which are quite readily available within the pages of Magick in Theory and Practice. All that is required is the application of them within the realm of sexuality. The Alchemical allegory of the Gnosis may be employed in so many ways that it is almost ridiculous to attempt any \"one\" pure and simple explanation. Note -Solve = the volatilization of the fixed, Coagula = the fixing of the volatile But see this apparently contradictory formulae : Solve = the fixing of the image of the will. Coagula = the realization of that image as a reality within the universe. Note that thus the \"solve\" aspect of the work cleanses the quintessential of all alien thought forms or previous coagulations of impurity (i.e. of any energy not properly in service to the will. These must be broken up and placed in a harmonic with the image.), it is the fluidic and transformative Mercury itself, the \"Coagula\" returns it to the macrocosmic system from whence it came, but now in its essential and perfect form of Self. Whatever particular Ray required by the Alchemist. Similarly applied such allegory may be put in the service of other aspects of the secret science - i.e. to the actual formation of the elixir itself. In every part of the work however, it should be remembered that the Solve contains"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"the Coagula and that the Coagula contains the Solve. All of these allegories are of use in various ways but have purposefully been designed to deceive. As Crowley councils us in The Paris Working: \"When deciphering the old magical grimoires, the secret always lies in suspecting the worst\", in other words - some form of sexual symbolism. Supposing then that there is something to my outline of these mysteries in fact. If so then, what is the true inner-essential gnosis of our own time? Sexual Magick is old hat -everybody knows \"the secret of the IXth degree\" already. It’s on television for god's sake. Every few days someone \"discovers\" it over again or accidentally reveals it...\"whoops gave away the secret of the ninth degree again.\" The agents of whoever they are have published all but the most significant documents, and these contain not much of anything that has not been said in slightly more esoteric ways already -and figured out as well. Very few are capable of actually performing it; but my point is that with the dissemination already so wide and interest so great -may it not be possible that another \"secret\" may already have produced its seed from the old tree and taken root in the inner-inner of the Aeon? Like the previous mysteries it shall have grown out of the old gnosis but contain a dimension that while including the old formulae is much, much more. The nature of it (if our other allegories are correct) would be diametrically opposite, perhaps in every direction now, to the old mystery. It will not be a return to a previous times sorceries, it will be as operational and real as were any of the verifiable aspects of the old science, but its use and complete ramifications will be obscure. No one shall have preceded us in the direction of research we shall be following. Most will consider us mad for trying -but .....? ! ...... Thus if there be another and hidden mystery, aside from that already so widely known (at least in gross & erroneous forms) -let us turn our minds thereto- focus our wills and endeavour to subdue the actual and formidable thing and make manifest that realization within our own beings. It is my contention that the eleventh degree holds the key to understanding. Perhaps a significant difference between the sexual-magic and the sexual-magick, i.e. between the old and the new formulae is that with Osirian methods - evocation was the major outcome i.e. the aeon certainly had its fair share of phantasms - the visions of the saints of a shadowy character -also note that since \"sin\" concealed the Priesthoods monopoly of the central mystery -all the demons and devils attributed to witchcraft are most highly shunned. Of course they objected to anyone but themselves who possessed the secret. The new formulae will then most likely utilize the secret as a mode of Invocation or as a synthetic of both realized as one in"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"the experience of the cosmos coming to know itself. There are certain aspects of the eleventh degree that are more apt to understanding of these subtleties than the other methods that may be employed toward that end. Historical Information (Laura Deerfield): Not a lot is currently known about Laura Deerfield. Rite of Mitylene The female fluid is acidic, corrosive. What happens when you combine the contents of two vessels of acidic fluid? The combination of any two fluids may produce a reaction, so that they become a third substance, and elixir. Now a dramatic corrosive chemical reaction may then cause a reaction with the very material of the vessels, corrupting them each according to the manner in which the elixir reacts to the material of each. Note that the shape of the vessel matters very little in this case, especially as , in a dramatic enough reaction the mutually corrupting fluids will become highly unstable and melt down not only the core but the entire outer structure of the vessel. There may be a chain reaction throughout the being containing the vessel and perhaps beyond it. In keeping with the 'undulatory' female pattern, as the structure of the vessel begins to break down pulses go out, smaller explosions which trigger a series of larger explosions rather than a single event as per the 'catastrophic' male pattern. While perhaps rarely reaching the level of impact or radiation of the latter, the female pattern creates less interference with itself and is therefore generally more sustained.(70) The Responses from Thelema-93l Internet Forum [Svedeka] The female fluid is acidic, corrosive. [V. H.] Funny, I never noticed any burns. But then, I have a hard time understanding why anyone would solemnly warn that Oil of Abramelin shouldn't be used on the genitals, and sometimes finds habaneros too mild, so I might have missed this fine point. I can't say that I've ever done a litmus test on the stuff. Why start with this corrosion symbolism? If we're going to make symbols, why not connect the female fluid with the amniotic water of life, the blood of the heart, submersion in the great ocean, or the liquid flow of consciousness, for instance? "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"[Svedeka] The blood of the heart is just another bodily fluid...doesn't do much for me as a symbol. Submersion in the great ocean & the liquid flow of consciousness are great for talking about Binah or perhaps Nuit, but, and this is just me, don't really work for me as a metaphor for lesbian sexual magick. Too generalized, too passive perhaps. I'll have to think more on that. Of course, a sea is highly corrosive, and there is usually a good sludge of decay at it's bottom. Now I'm going to rant a bit. (only partly to do with your comments) While \"the amniotic water of life\" might be appropriate for a woman working with the ninth degree, I do not consider it appropriate for the eleventh. It is one of those lovely new age-wicca-feminist reproductive symbols for a kind of fertility that is irrelevant to a lesbian rite. I intend to break from nature -my imperatives are not necessarily hers. I do not wish to re-produce, nor to bear a Child, but to become that Child. I embrace my vices, some of those often associated with women-corruption, dissolution, and decay, and not as passive but active forces. Images which imply women are somehow more \"natural\" than men are part of the ideas which have been used to keep women barefoot and pregnant for so long. Oh, but honey, you understand these things so much better than me ...I am tired of womanhood being described as natural, rhythmic & cyclical, her capability of re-production. Such images are ageist and irrelevant to the menopausal woman. Nor do they apply to me -I do not have regular, cyclical periods; I desire neither to be a baby-factory nor a homunculus assembly plant -but I do not consider myself somehow not a woman because of it. Perhaps this makes me an unnatural woman. Amen to that, sisters! [V. H.] For that matter, why be machen such a tzimmis about the fluid? Isn't the real work somewhere else? [Svedeka] Partly because this is only a very fragmentary beginning, developed from some thoughts on the nature and effect of a female-female elixir. And of course the process I speak of is co-extant in body and spirit. I won't say the \"real work\" is \"somewhere else\" because I find that a meaningless statement. There is no elsewhere, the body is the means by which the spirit finds expression and cohesion. They are 0=2...impossible to speak of separately. [Svedeka] In keeping with the 'undulatory' female pattern, as the structure of the vessel begins to break down pulses go out, smaller explosions which trigger a series of larger explosions rather than a single event as per the 'catastrophic' male pattern. While perhaps rarely reaching the level of"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"impact or radiation of the latter, the female pattern creates less interference with itself and is therefore generally more sustained. [V. H.] This seems like an overgeneralization about female orgasmic response. Some women are much like the stereotypical male -building steadily, reaching a single sharp climax, and then falling off rapidly to desensitization or over-stimulated inhibition. There is no general rule. [Svedeka] This was meant only as a generalization, not a statement of absolutes but of tendencies. [V. H.] Some men are more like the \"female\" response you describe. I've developed a sense of what I think of as \"aftershocks\" (in my head -no muscular component of which I am aware) which are different from but often as compelling as the original orgasm, sometimes more so, but they are not always present. These originally developed in the course of sex magic rituals through union of Hekati or Kali and Hathor or Medea with Pan or Tahuti. The same person may vary between these and other poles depending on complex variables like partner, mood, training, intent, etc. Orgasm is individualistic and even idiosyncratic and if you are going to include it in your formula -and you should consider whether it needs to be there- perhaps it might be best to leave a good part of the interpretation up to the practitioner. Finally, while wishing to retain my now public title of non-stooge for the O.T.O., I must admit it gets my dander up a bit when you or Kenneth Grant create new formulae and call them XI0. That just confuses the historical questions concerning Crowley's sex magic and related traditions. Creating new formulae is great but why distort these traditional titles? [jdnolan] Considering she apparently has access to an extensive collection of documents including Liber 1139, and Russell and Crowley's XIth degree commentaries to Emblems and Modes of Use, (since all are cited in these documents) which is far more than most people who blather about these issues do, nor is she bound by OTO oaths of Secrecy I have a hard time seeing what the difficulty here is, other than respect for secrecy that was mostly a product of now antiquated concepts about sodomy and the law. [Prospero] De Arte Magica is relatively clear that all of these formulae are living scientific expressions, and need to be advanced. What is being put forward here is in complete accord with Liber MCXXXIX where it is said \"a similar formula may be devised.\" In fact Frater Meithras XIth (now"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"deceased) was one of the few people with extensive access to the small corpus of actual XIth degree documents. Whether or not Grant does is questionable, but probable. The minor dilemma is that Crowley sometimes is ambiguous about what is actually the nature of the operation in those diary entries where he does cite the working. Grant just seems to personally abhor homosexual activity and so, it would seem to me, contrives to define the XIth degree in terms that he can practice, so as not to be left out of the loop. Motta mistakenly identified the XIth degree with OHO, where the pertinent entries in the Golden Book indicate that though an XIth degree is not necessarily the OHO, the OHO will be (or become) an XIth degree. [Svedeka] I personally have strong misgivings about applying my ideas to the OTO structure, and may decide it is an inappropriate framework for the Rite of Mitylene. The only reason I do so is, frankly, I was asked to. Around 1980, Meithras, Grand Master of the Rite of Shiraz XIth degree OTO (the man who re-created this degree in the modern OTO in 1978 with Grady McMurtry's recognition), began discussing with one Soror Alaya Kephra//Marashti the possibility of implementing a female Rite in the XIth degree. She named this the Rite of Mitylene, and they discussed it at length. Meithras, however, never felt that it was well enough developed to be a full companion Rite to that of Shiraz. When I met him, he had been estranged from the order for a number of years. (I'm avoiding opening a HUGE can of worms here -let it suffice to say the reasons were personal and political, not a questioning of the magical validity of the eleventh degree.) The eleventh degree had been allowed to lapse, and he had hope of reconciling himself to the order (or it to him) & reviving it again. He also hoped that I, in conjunction with Marashti would develop and implement the Rite of Mitylene. (Unfortunately I haven't been able to get in touch with her yet -anyone have an email or snail mail address for her?) He died at the end of September, and I am attempting to develop these ideas. He refused to have much say about them, other than to answer some direct questions about technical points, because he didn't want me to be unduly influenced and didn't think a man could say much. I have no official connection with the OTO and my posts should be taken only as my own ideas. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"[V.H.] Thanks for the history. One interpretation of the XI* that I sometimes hear is that it is meant to include everything that doesn't fall into the other O.T.O. formulae. I don't think this is really what Crowley intended by the term; he was referring to what at another point he referred to as having brought down fire from heaven in a way that no adept had dared to do before. So I would tend to think that your Rite of Mitylene should be called something different. One thing I seem to hear a lot from lesbians is that treating sex as centred around genitalia and orgasm is a male mode of sexuality. Of course there are schools of thought on this. I was wondering whether a lesbian sexual magic formula would need to be as concerned with finding genital symbols and ritualizing orgasm as Crowley's formulae have been. The New Moderns: (Llee Heflin) The Heflin/Phoenix Dialogues( 71) Edited Emails Between Llee Heflin And Frater Phoenix 18 May, 2000 Through 27 May, 2000 [Llee Heflin] On the limitations of Tantric formulae: Let's leave names aside for the moment. [Phoenix] I believe names are limiting. As I mentioned, the use of the term \"XIº\" is merely a convenience between people to describe the subject at hand. [LH] I hope you will agree with the proposition that the sexual dynamics inherent in the female body are qualitatively different from those inherent in the male body. And that this is so, based on factual physical differences between the male human body and the female human body. The dynamics of sexual experience between men and women are then particular to that relationship based on the potential interplay between those two different male and female dynamics. [P] Absolutely. No argument from me here. [LH] Now let us consider the male/male experience and the female/female experience. Does it not stand to reason that, since we have here two very different physical configurations, one from the other, and both from that of female/male experience, that the sexual dynamics of the male/male experience are going to be qualitatively different from the female/female experience, and that both will be different from the male/female experience?"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"[P] This I would completely concur as well. I consider for my own purposes that the male energy is catastrophic (linear) whereas the female energy is undulative (cyclic). The masculine nature is to overwhelm and project and the feminine is to radiate and consume/envelop. [LH] If I recall correctly, I made the case in The Island Dialogues that there will certainly be an XIº formula particular to women, but that that was none of my business. That I would not even presume to express an opinion about what it might be like (even though I did ponder it somewhat) but would rather leave it for women to discover for themselves. [P] I am hoping to involve in my future research a female team that can explore this particular path. [LH] There is one very real physical difference between the male and female bodies that makes the Tantric potential for a man not only qualitatively different from that of a woman but quantitatively different as well. A man can express both the 'yin' and the 'yang' more fully and directly than is possible for a woman. That alone makes the experience between men unique to men. This isn't something I have 'made up'. It's there, a fact. [P] I am making a large assumption here, but I would venture to guess that you are referring to the male ability to both \"give and take\" on the physical level as it were with another male. But this explanation does not address the energy work involved in a Tantric exercise. I would not dare question your views this early in our conversations. You have the experience and research to support your claims that I can only wish for at the early stage of the process. [LH] Yes of course I am referring to a man's capacity to fuck and get fucked, suck and get sucked And yes it does address the energy work in Tantric practice. For these physical sexual practices are a 'reflection' of the higher Tantric practices. [The] XIº is not merely a variation of the IXº (contrary to what these terms would appear to imply). Whereas the IXº formula could be expressed as 'active/passive', the XIº formula would more correctly be expressed as 'project/receive x project/receive'. There is nothing 'passive' about a man's capacity to 'receive'. A man's 'receptivity' is dynamic in a way in which the receptivity of a woman cannot be. [P] I can see that we might spend a little time working out differences in terminology, but it seems that my idea of active/active is very much what you have expressed here. I am sure there are great differences as I will try to explain my view in a moment. However, it seems to me that I am"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"confused as to the nature of the differences in the receptivity of men and women. How is a man's receptivity more dynamic than a woman's? One more thing here. Maybe I should ask you to back up for a moment and explain the term \"higher Tantric practices.\" I have spent the last two days in bookstores seeing Tantra connected with everything from great sexual positions to opening the chakras to 'how to fuck for wealth and power' books. I seem to be confused on specifically what you mean by such a phrase. [LH] I should be very clear about one thing here: I have no real interest is so-called 'sex-Magick' any more. AC defined 'Magick' more or less thus: the art/science of bringing about change in accordance with Will. This is, I suggest to you, by and large 'playing in Maya'. The term 'Maya' is most frequently translated as 'illusion' which, while related, does not get to the heart of the matter. As I understand it any way, 'Maya' names the meaning of the phrase: meaningless activity. In this sense, all of the activity in/of the physical universe is Maya. All of human activity is Maya. There is, as far as I know, only one activity available within the human sphere which is not 'meaningless'. That is the activity of realizing the nature of Maya and the nature of one's true Self, and the relation of one's Self to Maya. The illusionary aspect of Maya is our belief that the universe and human activity actually have the sense, significance, and meaning we project on to them as 'natural' properties. Any act of Will results in Maya with the sole exception of “Knowing thy Self”. All of 'creation' is Maya. But neither the 'Creator' nor the act of creating is Maya. Thus, if Magick is the 'act of creating' then Magick is 'real'. While at the same time all 'products' of Magick are Maya. There is, of course, nothing 'wrong' with creating Maya. It is the 'play' of Absolute Consciousness. Where the trouble comes in is when pieces of Absolute Consciousness attribute sense, significance, and meaning to their creations and then take them 'seriously'; as if they are 'real' phenomena with the absolute sense, significance, and meaning which their creator has attributed to them. Rather than seeing them for what they are: fun and games. Sex is nothing but fun and games. Except to the extent to which we can learn about Self through them, Sex-Magick and Tantra are, by and large, fun and games as well. As I said, there is nothing wrong with engaging in 'fun and games'. But for the Magician, the Adept, the Man of Truth, there comes a time when he or she much choose between engaging in fun and games and engaging in the quest for the realization of self. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"[P] I believe that many people view the \"XIº\" as merely a reversal of the \"IXº\" and that it is merely two men in a sexual practice with one male as active and the other as passive, priest and priestess in a sense. This is reflected in Patrick King's record for instance. I think this is incorrect. Since coming into possession of several of Patrick's papers, I have been collecting a reading list of sorts containing the materials that he suggested where of importance in understanding this practice. Since this is all I have to go on currently, I would argue that it is most likely incomplete and largely inaccurate. But I digress. Within one of the texts that are deemed important is a chapter from Liber Aleph. I believe that this sentence from that chapter illustrates my take on the whole picture so far and also the view to which I have viewed the hetero-/homo-sexual dichotomy in my own life. From De Oculo Hoor [emphasis mine]: \"For Things Unlike do in their Marriage produce a Child which is relatively Stable, and resisteth Change; but Things like increase mutually the Potential of their particular Natures.\" [LH] The quote from Liber Aleph is very germane. On the mundane level this is what happens within the heterosexual formula. The genetic patterns inherent in the female body compel women to do their damnest to corral (envelope) men and direct their energies into the 'baby-making/child rearing' project. I am constantly astounded at the power of the baby-making and mothering 'urge' that the female body exerts on the Consciousness of women. I assume that this came about because without such a 'compulsion' the rigors of baby -making and child rearing would almost certainly discourage reproduction dramatically. [P] If the quote is all that germane, then should it not stand to reason that \"...Things like increase mutually the Potential of their particular Natures\" is in more accordance with the homosexual formula? That, in theory, men and women have separate natures that are increased by their working with members of the same sex? It seems to me that, and indicative of the attitude in Patrick's \"Record,\" that most of the explanations to the XIº stem from some kind of need to put one man in a priest (or active/male) role and the other in a priestess (or passive/(fe)male) role. This, to me, seems contrary to the concept of increasing the mutual nature of the gender. Just because one man is a recipient does not, as we have already agreed, make him passive. [LH] I didn't mean to slight the second half of it. Just didn't get around to it. Certainly \"Things like increase mutually the Potential of their particular Natures\". I have always maintained that it is only in conjunction with another man than a man can learn to express his full nature and potential. Only a man can teach another man about his capacity for what we are calling 'receptivity' and all that that implies. Women cannot do this since"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"they cannot express the necessary 'projective' nature needed as the counter foil for a man to learn 'receptivity'. Women, in the main, want men to be 'men'. It is only in relationship with other men that men will learn to overcome the formula of alpha male competition. Women on the other hand just incite it. It has long been my observation that, in general, men like other men more than they really 'like' women, and visa versa. If both groups would only get over their hang-up about [homosexuality], the world would very likely be a lot saner place. [LH, in response to a query about the ‘alpha male’] Have you read much in the field of animal behaviour? The classic 'alpha male' competitive pattern occurs in species in which the males compete with each other to see which single male or very small group of males will have more or less exclusive access to sexually responsive females. This position is usually achieved through physical combat of varying degrees of severity. This pattern usually prevails down through the 'pecking order' of males in the group. So that, down the chain from the 'top dog', one is submissive to those above, but dominant over those below you in the pecking order. This 'pecking order' is never stable. Which means that competition is ever present to one degree or another. The pressure is always from the bottom up. The young Turks are always nipping at the heels of the old pros. And periodically there is a 'catastrophic' violent upheaval in the system and the entire structure is reordered as some challenger manages to oust the Alpha Male who is usually either killed or driven from the group or becomes the low man in the pecking order. This inevitably gives way to a rearrangement of the whole pecking order in one fashion or other. The important thing to understand is that, as a pattern of behaviour, it is totally 'projective', totally 'active' in the sense we are using these terms in our discussion. This pattern runs rife through out human society, through out human history. Though as I have pointed out elsewhere, the goal has been abstracted in our case to one of pure 'power'. But still, at its foundations it remains a sexual competition. It is a battle of dicks: my dick is bigger than your dick. And in our social matrix the connotation is that, if I win, I'm gonna fuck you u pussy! In other primates such as the chimps and great apes, the males on the low end of the pecking order ritually submit themselves to the alpha males as if they are females in 'heat', and the alpha male will symbolically mount them. This is done to prevent attack by the alpha male. In human society there are vestiges of this to be found. What is the 'worst' thing one man can say to another? Fuck You, You Cunt, U Pussy, U Fag! All power mongering is rooted in this pattern. Every dictator is nothing but a successful alpha male demonstrating his 'power' to 'fuck' whoever or whatever strikes his fancy. This is the origin of the childhood game 'king of the mountain' which is that game taken to its logical extreme. Getting"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"fucked becomes a position of inferiority and shame. Witness the attitude of so many men and cultures dominated by men towards women. And I see this pattern lurking in the heart of the IXº. Me Tarzan, you Jane. You are right to deplore the top/bottom pattern of heterosexuality because it leads to a pattern of 'superiority/inferiority'. It leads to a true dichotomy of opposition: either/or. I see the XIº as being, on the other hand, a pattern uniting the dichotomy in a mutually inclusive bi-polar pattern of 'both/and' where both 'poles' are deemed worthy and necessary for 'wholeness'. The XIº man exalts in the manifestation of both roles. He has united the 'opposites' in his being and thus his being becomes a 'wholeness'. And out of that wholeness emerges a new social pattern among such whole unified men based on the desire to unite with their brothers rather than to dominate them in a power struggle. In a certain sense though, this does not really eliminate the 'power struggle' for dominance. Rather it transforms that struggle into 'love play'. One dominates for love's sake: the other submits for love's sake. And at any moment the polarity can reverse itself and the 'slave' becomes the 'king' and visa versa. I have said that men are not going to realize this in relation to women. It has been hoped for a very long time that men would learn be 'example' from women. But as a 'methodology' that proposal has obviously been a failure. Given men's historical attitudes about and towards women, they are not likely to become 'submissive' to them willingly. (And before you protest that you do (if you should feel so inclined), I ask you to contemplate your situation very carefully and deeply before responding.) And even were that to happen, what would they be submitting to? Not to 'penetration' for that is not physically possible. For a man to fully understand the 'power' of the phallus he must himself submit to penetration by it. And there is a greater 'mystery' here as well. \"As above, so below\" In order to be receptive to the phallic power from 'above', a man must be receptive to it 'below'. It is the XIº 'marriage' that is the refection of the 'divine' marriage and not that of the IXº. [P] I cannot see that there is an active/passive split within this working. For men, an active/active working; for women, a passive/passive working. Or rather, in other words, two paths: one fully catastrophic and the other fully undulatory. The third path, of course, being that of the male/female is something that combines the two (active/passive) and produces a result that should be balanced between them and stable. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"I could be way off but then, as you can see, my research has been primarily on my own without either direction or concrete evidence from anyone \"in the know.\" [LH] But I will here suggest to you that your proposal of 'active/active' (at least as I am understanding it) would be something like turning two fire hoses directly onto each other. You would indeed have a 'catastrophic' situation. The pattern as I am presenting it is what allows the dynamics to be a kind of controlled explosion without it resulting in catastrophe. 'Active/active' is what you have in man/man relations in the heterosexual world. And the result is indeed catastrophic much of the time. [P] Catastrophic in my dictionary(72) provided me with the following definitions: 1: the final event of the dramatic action 3a: a violent and sudden change [...] 3b: a violent usually destructive natural event I find that the male formula, no matter how it is expressed, is catastrophic. It resolves to a final dramatic event, violent and sudden change even in its explosive nature. The male response is linear in nature. It builds and it blasts and it disappears. It is the Atu XVI, the Tower, in its function. Aside from arguments that some men are multi-orgasmic, it is my understanding that the majority of men have \"spent their energy\" in a single blast and have to recover prior to continuing further activities. [LH] Your use of the term [catastrophic] describes the sexual experience of most men to a tee, much to the dissatisfaction of most women and a lot of gay & bisexual men. And that is a great shame. I get the impression from my experience that most men do not understand the experience of orgasm at all. They blast off, [i.e.] ejaculate, get a 4 second rush, and then they are exhausted. That's pathetic. [P] However, on a physical level is this not exactly what happens? In my mind, orgasms are biological in nature. They are \"an explosive discharge of neuromuscular tensions.\" Whatever resultant energy that may continue is not the orgasm but rather an extension of that orgasm, or at least it is the underlying energy of the orgasm itself that is continued after the orgasm. In any case, for a man, the sexual experience is that linear experience of rise, expel (orgasm), and fall. Whether or not the resultant energy is continued pas t the end point, I think, is the goal of the exercises, and the use of that energy the goal of this practice. "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"[LH] I think we are here again faced with the problem of definition of terms. I would say that the experience you describe is much closer to what I would call 'ejaculation', just a blip on the sexual radar screen, if you will. An 'orgasm' is a 'worm hole ride' to another 'world' another 'universe', the melting away of names until you have arrived in a state of pure unalloyed sensation. Once there, there is nothing more to 'do' there, all you can do is 'BE'. Should the thought of using 'IT' arise in your 'mind', you would be instantly blown out of that state, back into the mundane world (of ejaculation). My experience with so many men has been that, either they do not understand that what you are calling 'orgasm' and I have here referred to as 'ejaculation' is merely the first stage of the 'rocket' and therefore get off the ship before it breaks free of the gravitational pull of the mundane world, or they are not capable to riding the rocket further. (It just freaks me out that they are 'through' after about 45 seconds and are then reaching for their cigarettes!) [P] Maybe my perspective is a bit different since I am bi-sexual rather than gay, but it occurs to me that many of the people that were involved in the attempted revival of this practice in OTO were gay and attempting to force their own gay top/bottom roles into a practice that requires not only requires a mutual nature but equality in that nature as well. Your explanation of a dynamic receptivity rather than a passive receptacle seems much more logical and exact to the nature of this practice. [LH] Because of the 'baby-making' thing,(73) [see above] [P] Funny you bring this up again. I [wrote to a knowledgeable female friend] and asked her about the inherent energies of women. She, assuming that I had made the comments of course, had this to say: \"People and even women go beyond their biology all the time. Your views are very Aristotelian. That 's an observation, not criticism. Men have their own version of the goal to reproduce. Have you thought of that? That's what the promiscuity is all about! It's a very male thing. We have strange forces of motivation in mating. Now, we have to go beyond the fucking, beyond the offspring, and beyond the biology.\" [LH] I do not think that the males of any species actually has a 'goal to reproduce' in any sense of the phrase to the extent to which I see that females have a biological drive to baby-making. I see that in virtually every species the goal of reproduction is primarily invested in the females of the species. Whereas the goal of the males of virtually all species is towards the joys of the sex experience. That is what promiscuity is all about."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"'Reproduction' is almost certainly the last thing they are thinking about, if they are capable of thinking about it at all. It is the more or less scarcity of sexually responsive females coupled with the joys of sexual experience that drive what I have referred to earlier as 'alpha male' competition in the vast majority of species. (In the human species, because sexual experience is so readily available, alpha male competition has become abstracted into more or less competition for its own sake, for the joys of power for its own sake.) The motivational 'forces' in human mating (or most any species mating for that matter) are not strange at all. Women are 'driven' by the biological programmes of baby-making (plus purely sexual urges as well of course) and men are driven by the biological programmes of fuck-making sexual urges. And both are driven by the overwhelming urge of Absolute Consciousness toward sensation(al) experience in general. Consciousness is a sensation junkie. In our neck of the cosmos, energetic human bodies give Consciousness the best sensation experience. We call that experience 'sex'. And your friend is absolutely right when she says “Now, we have to go beyond the fucking, beyond the offspring, and beyond the biology.\" Except for one caveat: We don't have to do anything whatsoever. We are free to stay engrossed in whatever sensation is getting us off for all of eternity. And nothing in the Universe will give a damn. On the other hand if you want to go beyond the limitations of the human world you do have to get beyond fucking, baby-making and beyond biology all together. [LH] (74)Women, because of that, tend to internalize and in a sense 'horde' the energies they receive to be channelled into the maternal project. (\"TO ME! TO ME!” isn't that what Nuit says?) In this respect, their dynamics are directed else where. [P] Again, in response to my query on female dynamics and \"merely reflecting the energy,\" the above mentioned woman had this to say: \"Women are the energy, in a most powerful way, and most, when they are not damaged, and have learned to work their own energy. Men have energy too, but to take it beyond the mundane takes something more.\" Without disrespect for either of you, it sounds to me as if she and you are both saying that the opposite gender lacks the ability to really \"get it.\" I personally find this unsatisfactory. I cannot, so far, accept that either gender is \"damaged\" in some way that inhibits their energy to be accessible to the other gender. But then, I admit this may have a lot to do with my bisexual mind. "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"[LH] Both the male and the female body are energy and are conduits for energy. But each, by its biological nature constrains that energy in a particular way. For both to take energy beyond the mundane takes something more. The biological nature of the female body is very heavily weighted towards the baby-making and rearing programmes. I suggest that this has come about because the rigors of baby-making and rearing are so arduous that without this biological pressure (and of course the stroke of 'genius' in this programme is to make the emotional/sensational experience of that experience so overwhelmingly pleasurable and satisfying) the programme would be far less likely to succeed. It appears to be genuinely 'oceanic' in its scope and ever present. It doesn't just happen one or two nights a week. And I have come to conclude that, for a great many women, the ongoing experience of 'mothering' is considerably more satisfying than sex. Because this biological pressure is so great and because the experience is so oceanically pleasurable, most women find it very difficult to go beyond it in a given life time. This is made doubly difficult because this mothering experience tends to extend thou out the mother's life since here attachment to her children remains in tact until the end. 'Mother' becomes a totally absorbing 'role' or self identity that can and more often than not does, last for a life time. I am not saying that women can't 'get it' as much as I am saying that they have a more difficult hand of cards to play with. The situation for men is considerably different. For men the biological experience, while 'sensational' in the extreme, is at the same time periodic and more or less short lived. We have sex, we get off, and then we get on with our lives. Until that is, the biological pressure builds up again and we seek out sexual experience. Sexual experience is an end in its self. It is nothing but pure sensation. And no matter to what heights one takes it, it remains that only: pure sensation. For this reason it is relatively easier to realize that it is what it is: a limited function of a limited physical body. This in turn makes it relatively easier to detach one's Self from the experience and the body. The identity sexual experience creates for a man is no where near as all encompassing as can be the identity of 'mother' for a woman. (I will have something more to say on this when, at some point, I discuss my experience with my initiation companion who was a woman.) This makes it somewhat easier for a man to get beyond biology than it is for a woman. In the end Liberation is from attachment to and identification with the body; which means, since gender is a property of the body, from attachment to and identification with gender. It is also from sexuality since the body is the source of sexual experience. "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The energetic sexual experience between men and women is obviously very powerful and very satisfying. But its scope, if I can put it that way, is limited by the biology of each. The sexual experience between men is also limited by the biology of the male body but the potential scope of possible experience is created than that between a man and a woman. The sexual experience between women is also limited by the biology of the female body but the potential scope of possible experience is, or so it seems to me, less than that possible between either men or a man and a woman. This is not to say that it is not powerful and satisfying. But I suspect that it's potential 'power' is less than the other two patterns, even though it may be equally satisfying. [LH] Whereas with men, there is no such 'drain' on the system and their receptivity almost automatically feeds back directly into the system. (\"I GO\" said Hadit) And I think that men GO to the phallus with far greater intensity than do women. Men simply have a 'passion' for the phallus that women cannot have since they do not know the phallus directly. Thus their receptivity has about it that quality of 'going' as well as that of 'to me'. [P] This, on the other hand, makes complete sense to me with one minor exception. I can accept that a man has the ability to achieve the formula of to go as well as the formula of to me, but how can one man achieve both at the same time. It seems to me that by reintroducing the opposing formulas into the mix, you place this back into the arena of active/passive (top/bottom, priest/priestess, god/goddess) again. I am sure that I am missing something, hence the request for clarification. [LH] Do you know the symbol of the serpent with its tail in its mouth? I get the impression that your thinking here is too literal, too focused on the physical facts of sexual experience. In a sense I would say you are thinking too much like a heterosexual here. Look, the so-called 'opposites' of yin and yang, give and take, filling and containing etc. etc. are not separate formulae. They are the two opposing terminals in a single bi-polar formula. They are not mutually exclusive. They are mutually inclusive. They are mutual necessities. One cannot be without the other. When united they form a unity (0=2). They do not annihilate each other in union forming a singularity (0=1). By the nature of its biology, the female body is more or less exclusively restricted to the yin, take, containing side of the formula. I think this came about because this formulation proved most effective for optimizing the positive outcome of baby-making and child rearing. The maximum amount of the energy taken in was converted into support for those activities out of biological necessity. The female body is all 'x' chromosomes The male body on the other hand has both the 'x' and 'y' (the so-called 'male'"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"chromosome) chromosome. Thus the male body has built into it the biological basis for both the yin and yang etc. It is of course the 'y' chromosome that gives the male body its 'phallic' energetic potential. Now in the heterosexual pattern, the all yin female body is going to be a very powerful draw on the yang side of the male body. The man's yin potential is overwhelmed by the woman's yin actuality. Thus the heterosexual man is pretty much restricted to fulfilling the yang to the woman's yin. And in so doing the formula is fulfilled. 1 + 1 thus 0=2 (in this formulation '0' stands for 'unity') But now let us consider the situation between two men in which there is no pressure for either to restrict their potential to either polarity of the formula. Where you have two men who are both equally able to fulfil both polarities of the formula. Here the situation is considerably more complex. You have: (0=2) + (0=2) I get the impression that your problem in grasping this is that you are applying to this formulation, what is essentially the 'either or' heterosexual situation, when in fact what you have here is a case of 'both and'. Now it is obvious that a great many gay men know no better than to apply the 'either or' heterosexual model to their own experience. And of course it works, more or less to the same extent that it works in the straight experience. But that is not what I am talking about. I am talking about a situation wherein the polarities can shift back and forth as quickly and as often as the two men can and will to do so. Sure there will be times when it comes to fucking and one fills and the other contains. But who does what to whom is not here predetermined. It can as easily go one way or the other. And when they push beyond the mundane to the more subtle realms the possibilities are staggering. They can create 'engines' of awesome capabilities. [LH] (Whereas men can, on the other hand, know a passion similar to the woman's passion for the vagina if they experience the passion of getting fucked.) You will have to tell me if this makes any sense to you. [P] Yes, to an extent. I can see where a man can experience the perspective of a woman. However, this returns to those role-playing games that I am so desperate to remove from the male/male formula as I see it. Again, I ask, am I missing something really basic and simple here? [LH] Of course we must eliminate the heterosexual role playing from the male/male formula. But yin and yang are not, in and of them selves female/male, woman/man. The latter are specific examples of a very abstract pattern, i.e. yin and yang. It is up to you to re-exemplify the abstraction. What you must keep very clearly in mind is that no example is ever equivalent to the abstraction it is an example of. The abstraction its self is never manifested as it is. What manifests is always an example. That"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"is the fatal error of orthodoxy: it always declares that their example is the abstraction. [Last minute note: In speaking with my Mate about this, she disagrees with you. She enjoys both vaginal and anal sex with [two men]. But she finds that anal sex is not like vaginal sex to her, that it is two completely different experiences as well as energy levels in both pleasure and orgasm. She feels that she and [a former lover] move energy better vaginally, whereas she and I move energy better anally. (What that says about me as a lover I would rather not guess. LOL!) She would like to know how you consider anal sex to be similar to vaginal sex. She feels that anal sex would be about the same for both genders whereas vaginal sex is very exclusive to women.] [LH] Well obviously I can't speak from the same level of experience on what she says as she does, at least not from this life time any way. But I have to say that I find it hard to accept her assertion that they are two completely different experiences without any similarities at all. From what I know of physiology and neurology I cannot believe that they are absolutely categorically dissimilar experiences. On the other hand I do not question her assertion that vaginal sex is very exclusive to women. How could I? But to a degree this is all beside the point that I was trying to make. The point I was trying to make was that a man can have a quite overwhelming experience of getting fucked that, from what women friends have told me about their vaginal sexual experience, that is every bit as sensational, powerful and 'undulatory' (rather than 'catastrophic') as the vaginal experience. In a way the point here is that it is completely different from the phallic experience. And represents a legitimate expression of the 'yin' pattern, no less than does the vaginal expression. I can concede her point without at the same time having to disavow mine. While vaginal experience is unique to women, it is not the unique experience of the 'yin'. But whereas the female body can express to yin only, the male body can express both the yin and the yang. So in this respect the phallic experience is more unique to men than the vaginal experience is to women. I sincerely hope this can be understood as something other than a 'put down' of women. For it is not intended as such at all. [LH] I find your use of the term 'catastrophic' for the male dynamic very interesting if a bit puzzling. Is this your own invention or gleaned from somewhere else? [P] My definitions are a bit of both. I have recently begun to attempt to remove such OTO connotations that have bogged down the understanding"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"of these formulas. As I progress and begin to understand these practices myself, I am sure that I will develop other terminology as well. For now, it is all I have. Up until now, as I explained before, my research has been very limited to my own mind and the written resources of Crowley and his interpreters. I have utilized the OTO degree system as a matter of convenience to describe these practices. Just to provide you with an understanding of my logic (as well as most likely how far off track I have been), my original breakdown until now has been as follows: VIIº = Adorative/Meditative (Sexual) Technique VIIIº = Autoerotic Sexual Technique IXº = Heteroerotic Sexual Technique Xº = Generative Sexual Technique XIº = Homoerotic Sexual Technique These are, of course, based upon my interpretations of the upper degree papers that are found within Francis King's The Secret Rituals of the OTO. I can make no claim as to the accuracy or lack thereof of the book. I know that the lower degree rituals are accurate insofar as the initiations that I took during my OTO career. [LH] In my scheme of things, the VIIIº and Xº are reflections of each other. And the IXº and the XIº are reflections of each other. I suspect that, except for the Xº we are pretty much in agreement. For me the Xº is the degree of 'celibacy' in which the initiate becomes 'whole' and is then able to move on to the XIº degree if he should so choose. [P] Within my notes on the upper degrees, I find that I wrote concerning the VIIº: \"Adoration of the phallus as Baphomet, both within and without.\" Meditative Sex Magick(?). Of this, it seems to be nothing more than a preliminary of the VIII°. Such instructions that exist seems to be directly related to the VIII° workings, though in more of a religious or meditative technique than a sexual Magick technique. Also, could it not be \"Adoration of the kteis as Babalon, both within and without\"? I felt that there must be a reason for this degree. It seems to be the last of the \"preliminary practice\" degrees necessary for the workings that came after it. On the Xº, I wrote: Generative Sexual Technique. Procreative Sex Magick. Of this, there is no precedent in writing though the logical and linear conclusion from the IX° seems to suggest this is correct. Could it be that in actuality the paper"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"entitled De Homunculo is the X° working and not merely an allegory to the IX°? Since, by all accounts that I have found, the IXº is about interrupting the physical procreative process, it merely seemed logical to me that the Xº was the fulfilment of that process in the expectation of an heir apparent. Since the Xº is the \"Supreme and Holy King\" of the Order and is required to produce his own heir, procreating an heir (in modern legal reality, by appointment of succession or vote) seems to be the proper formula of this degree. For better or worse, OTO is based on a dynastic formula, and a King without an heir is not much of a King at all. Where I disagree with your degree analysis is the ability to \"move on to the [XIº] degree if he so choose\" from the Xº. Since the XIº \"has no relation to the general plan of the Order, is inscrutable, and dwells in its own Palaces,\" one does not necessarily have to come to grips (though it might be prudent) with any of the other upper OTO degrees in order to attain to those Palaces. In this may be another key to the subversive nature of the XIº to the initiatory structure of the Order that has been mentioned elsewhere. This would also suggest to me that the XIº is no mere reflection of the IXº as you yourself said in one of our initial emails. The XIº is necessarily a completely different formula to that of the IXº. Even if the result of any particular working is, for all practical purposes, the same in the end (no pun intended), one method for reaching that result is complete alien to the other. [LH] I see now more clearly that there is one area where our thinking diverges considerably. Whereas you regard the degrees VIII through IX almost entirely within the context of the OTO, I think of them almost entirely outside of that context. For me they are convenient labels to use when talking with people who know them. But as is almost always the case with verbal communication, defining terms is of great importance if real communication is to take place. In my world I use the rubric of the IXº, for instance, to cover the whole gamut of heterosexual 'working' from the lowest of the mundane to the heights. In my world 'baby-making' is the supreme 'formula' of that degree. In my interpretation of sex-Magick, no matter what the 'goal' is, it is still a 'baby' of sorts, a Magickal childe if you will. My interpretation of the Xº, for example, has nothing to do with the OTO at all, though I think it would be applicable. Instead it is an interpretation based on my interpretation of human sexuality in general."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"[LH] Do you have any knowledge about why, after Grady apparently sanctioned King's establishing the degree within the order, those who are now in charge have rescinded this sanction to the point of even denying that it ever existed? [P] To be honest, I don't know. I have found that in one of the recent volumes of The Equinox the current Frater Superior did sign his name with XIº in releasing The Paris Working. So I too am suddenly confused as to why this degree has suddenly disappeared. It has been suggested in one Forum that \"there is an obvious implication throughout [much of Crowley's works] that the [XIº] is more or less subversive to the initiatory structure of the OTO.\" The implication being that the current administration will not tolerate such subversion. Whether or not this is true, or the underlying meaning to the statement, is beyond my particular knowledge. [LH] In a sense the XIº would be subversive to the whole structure of the OTO, because it is, by its very nature non-hierarchical. In it there are no obvious sharply delineated 'superior' and 'inferior' 'positions'. It is truly 'Gnostic' as I have come to understand that term from my extensive study of the work on that subject by Prof. Elaine Pagel. [P] I have heard of Ms. Pagel's work though I have never read anything authored by her. As to the subversion of the Order, I can see this clearly. To back up a couple of emails, I received a statement this morning from one of the higher ups in OTO concerning the past existence of the XIº in OTO. I have asked for more explicit information, but [...] (after seeing this statement) I won't get it. However, for what it is worth(75) [Frater BT] The deceased Patrick King was chartered by Grady to set up an experimental version of the XIº degree. That did not conform to the degree as Crowley used it. The experiment ended some years before Patrick's death, as far as OTO is concerned.(76) [P] It is rumoured that [the Frater Superior] officially 'disbanded' the XIº recently (as in, within the last several years, actual time frame unknown) and actually made a statement that it no longer existed. [Frater BT] Closer to ten years ago, in regard to Patrick's thing. XIº is still in existence, but not in that limited form. [P] What, if you are at liberty to say, in Patrick's experiment was not in conformity with the degree as Crowley used it? "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"[Frater BT] Purely interested in same sex experiments in parallel to the IXº. That's not the nature of the XIº under Crowley. Regarding the sexual aspects, Crowley's diaries include instances of same or mixed sexual workings under this head. Also, there are aspects to the degree that were not touched upon in Patrick's experiment. [P] You imply it was disbanded ten years ago, but that it still exists in a broader existence? [Frater BT] No. Patrick's thing was closed out then by OTO and the real thing was established. [P] This strikes me as odd for two reasons. One, [the Frater Superior] signed The Paris Working (a known homosexual/XIº working) in Equinox IV(2) with XIº after his name only two years ago. [Frater BT] Yes, that's an example of the use. [P] [continued from above] I have yet to see any publication before or since released with such designation by him. Two, it would seem that the alleged existence of Crowley's papers that gave a XIIº as OHO would still leave the XIº in \"its own Palaces\" and outside the regular structure of OTO (per Intimation, et.al.). [Frater BT] No contradiction. Can't be in XIº without another degree membership in OTO. Holding multiple degrees below the highest possessed is the regular structure. Don't quote me, since I don't have authority or full comprehension of the details, but \"outside the regular structure\" can mean that particular degree may not be held by some and may be held by others, without regard to particular other degrees also held.

Publication in Class A and B In the fall of 1967 the author of this book, then twenty-eight years old, made his first conscious contact with those intelligences who act as the directors and programmers for the evolution of life in this particular Solar system. Via telepathic means they systematically prepared him to be the channel for a major input of information regarding the new energy matrix the planet Earth phased into at some undefined point around the turn of the century. During the following four years these 'Secret Chiefs,' as they are known in Western Magickal Tradition led this man to a series of meetings in San Francisco; Placitis, New Mexico; New York City; London; Positano, Italy; and Los Angeles at which they initiated him step by step into the role for which he was being prepared. In May of 1971 he was told to leave Los Angeles and to drive toward Canada along the coast. They said he would know where he was going when he got there. He recognized a house on the Western side of Camano Island near the upper end of Puget Sound in Washington State as his destination. During the following month the final preparations were completed. Once this was done, one of these Intelligences tantrically linked up with him and for the next few weeks transmitted the message he was to carry through a series of eight dialogues.

Judge not lest you judge your self. 'Both' and 'And' are the angels of duality so-called. They will lead you into the reality of your true self.

They also teach control of the demons 'Either' and 'Or' by showing that choice is based on the need of the chooser and not in the inherent 'moral' value of the various choices.

All action in the Universe is sacred to me for it is the ecstasy of my being in action, in its process of being. Whatever brings you to the awareness of being me is cause for your well-being, happiness and ecstasy. In this matter beware of the demons 'Either' and 'Or' and judge not the ecstasy of any world save your own, for while it is true that all things are cause for ecstasy in all worlds in the actual manifestation of the Universe in time, all things are not possible all the time in all points in space. Therefore in your world this is ecstasy and that is not, while in the world next to you that is ecstasy and this is not. Both are my ecstasy so let neither damn the other for not being as he is for in my being you are the same. Your particular sense of ecstasy is that particular sense in me. Again beware of the demons for they lurk at every turn to catch you unaware. Always walk on the side of the angels. Find the ecstasy in all experience. Refine your sense of ecstasy to the finest most minute point and stretch it out to encompass the broadest most general of activities.

If you see hunger as an evil it is because you are not learning what it may teach you. If you feel pain as evil then you are not learning what it may teach you. Any experience that I place you in is for your ultimate benefit. If you would approach all of your life with that in your consciousness you would see only good in the world. You have been falsely taught to see evil. The one who tempted Jesus the Christ in the wilderness was his beloved twin brother.

Give both freely for you have naught to lose. You are the sole validation of the formula. If it works for you it is valid for you. If it does not it is not for you. Accept no truth beyond that which you make your own. Test then this truth of your understanding by applying it to the object in question and see if you again obtain the same truth, and be wise Shakti for it may come to you this time in a different form. Until you are able to call an object into operation and achieve the same results every time you do not understand the object. The task is not easy Shakti. It requires great strength, great courage and great endurance. But if you would succumb to the mere test of words you would perish in an instant in the world you aspire to. Though I say here, Shakti, it is better you should awake for one instant only to perish the next than not to awaken at all. And again know in my love of you as you experience it in the fiery heart of our orgasms, that I would not test your will simply for the pleasure of seeing you toil for each event is so created as to provide you with a necessary capacity or skill for living in all worlds. And so it is with the use of words. Here also is a difficulty and a blessing if you can but surmount the difficulty. I speak to you in words that are as numbers. They are abstractions or root ideas. This is so for two reasons. You have approached very close to me, my Shakti, you have, without knowing it, without understanding it, touched my heart. That awareness you are not yet strong enough to bear. In my true self all exists as a single whole-of-parts, the abstract of the abstract, the pure of the pure, the root of the roots. My language reflects my being. I cannot be other than what I am. Now here is the blessing, Shakti. For the more abstract the object the more functions it contains. Therefore the less I give you specifically the more I give you potentially. You must first pierce the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"specific to discover the core abstraction, from that position you may then proceed to all other specifics which branch from it. Here is a secret, Shakti, all true abstractions are simple actions standing in direct relationship to one other such action: this is an example, containing/filling. They are correlatives rather than oppositions. There is no thing which opposes containing. True understanding is dependent on the experience of the correlative, the duality. By giving you the abstraction rather than the specific there is no danger of limiting your specific reality. As it is you are limited by the concept of the Universe in which you exist. But within that limit you are limitless. Herein is another secret for your crown which I give you to wear openly for the illumination of all, for while you possess them you possess them not. Hide not my light in the least for the least of it restricted will burn you to an ash. Here then is the jewel: if you would exceed the limits of this Universe persist unto its end and go with me into my next Universe. This I tell you truly you can do. You see, Shakti, I am what I am, I speak in circles always in circles. Has it become clearer to you? Yes Lord, but I must still wrestle with it as Jacob wrestled with the Angel. Yes, Shakti, come wrestle with me as did Jacob. Part Two: The Fifth My God My God You are Live Loving Living Love Light You are my God I am your Shakti. My Lord, it has come to me that I should record these conversations or ours that they may benefit more than just my self. For in that they teach me that I may love you more, would not my brothers also learn more the love of you from them? I am pleased, my Shakti, that you should desire to share our love with your brothers. For our loving is the loving I have with all. I say to you that you are all love to me, that there is none called Shakti save you. And while this is true without doubt, yet I say this to all and to all it is true. In wisdom, Shakti, love all with your body and spirit, with your intellect and emotions and you are loving me. And as our communing with words is a way of our loving so too is it our loving to share our words. But Shakti as this is filled with great wisdom so it is also filled with great folly. Of this I"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"will show you so that by its understanding you may accomplish the one by respecting the reality of the other. Shakti, by your desire to aid your brothers you are in fact desiring to aid yourself. Now this is as it should be for I say to you desire that only which is for your true benefit alone and you shall be a blessing to the Universe. If you question an action as to your benefit you will ultimately extend your awareness of self to all things. Herein lies a secret Shakti if you would but awaken to your self and know and understand your self fully at all times, you will need seek no further for validation of your Will; for all that is, is in you and to satisfy your true self is to satisfy all. Again I say, Shakti, behind every door we are. It matters not where we choose to love only that we choose to love. But there is naught to fear, for even in your hesitation over time-and-space there is our love in action. Our love is at all times in all spaces. There is naught which is not our love. To love is all wisdom. Herein is the folly in your desire, your wisdom. Few will receive what you give. Few will know, few will understand. And this is the wisdom of your folly for you will accomplish it even knowing the folly therein. There is no way to avoid the folly Shakti for it is the way. If there be the one there is the other. For though the thoughts in what I say are direct of me the words which I contain them in are yours, Shakti. I choose them specifically so that you alone may perceive my thoughts therein. I have chosen images that you are able to recognize in order to build the picture I want you to experience. And while it is true that all exists in all, it is also true that all is not conscious in all, all of the time. Therefore, Shakti, your words, while they hold my thoughts in truth, will not be seen as doing so save to those who are conscious as you are conscious. They will see only you in your words and will say to you \"Who are you to say these are the words of God. They are but the words of your folly.\" If you are wise, you will answer \"Truly truly is it so,\" and will pass on unaffected. Curse them not for their blindness. Say not that it is their folly. For truly it is your own and blest be you for it. Should they take their folly to the extreme, love me in all they do and you will suffer not. For it is their folly that they see you as something other than themselves, that they see no further than ink and paper. For I tell you now that if you should accomplish your desire it will be a childe of our love. Shakti, be not attached to the way of your book of words. Present it without pomp and circumstance. "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Make no claim as to the power of its contents, to its amazing grace. Say simply that it is a gift to you that you will give to all who will receive. Once it is produced renounce all claim to it other than as the door thru which it entered. It will accomplish what it is in my mind for it to accomplish. Be not fearful on this account if you do not see results of its publication for in time it will fulfil its self. Be prepared, though, to answer for it to all those with honest inquiry. There shall be some many who will glimpse me in part in what you have done and will seek to know and understand more. Here too give all because in doing so you give all to me. And there will be those who come only to dispute you, only to say \"Not so! Not so!\" To them reply \"Let us love with each other in body, emotions, intellect and spirit.\" This is the only answer. Some may do so and see. Most will depart to find their way elsewhere. Be not concerned that any man shall not see for all will in time. Herein is wisdom of what you do in your book. For to me it is as important that my light should be made to shine as it is, as well as for it to be seen by men. This too is folly within wisdom. Do not mistake your vision of me as the true vision, and wonder why all others do not fall down before it. While it is true and a vision of truth it is other than truth its self. Realize, Shakti, that as soon as the vision is complete, if you are truly wise, you will say \"Though this be true in all ways, there is more truth than this\" and will forsake it making of it but yet another star in your heaven and will again be an innocent virgin in which I will plant yet more of my seed. For you are my man and my woman at the same time. And I am lover to both. Part Two: The Sixth My God My God You are Live Loving Living Love Light You are my God I am your Shakti. My Lord there is much talk about love among men, about what is love and what is not. I would ask you to teach me more concerning this confusion. You have asked this on our first night of love, now I will love you with words on love. I have said that all is love and I say again that all is love. And that no being should misunderstand my meaning in the word love. Love is the all-inclusive interpenetration of my being in that of my Shakti, and though you as yet do not know it, of my Shakti in me, in constant surging orgasm. The Universe which I am and is me is our orgasm. In man terms Shakti, I say plain, all love is fucking with me. All is orgasm with me"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"in me from me to me. I am perpetually in the fires of loving all things. All the Universe is a great sensual pleasure to me. There is naught but that is my body. There is naught but that is my spirit and my emotions and my intellect. These are all functions of my self and within each and all of my self do I engage in the sensual central ecstasy of loving you, Shakti. No part of me denies its participation in our loving. No part says, \"I am spirit or I am intellect and I am above this thing you do.\" For wherein would they go to avoid what I am engaged in. I have said that if your one eye should offend you tear it out should a hand offend you cut it off. And so would I do should my spirit or intellect so offend me. Much confusion is experienced by men over their attempt to find me in the spirit by denying the flesh when the flesh and spirit are but one within the other different reflections of the same thing. That 'thing' being what they are together. Here again is the work of 'Either' / 'Or' for they try to validate the spirit as me by denying that I am the flesh and thereby invalidate both. How they do struggle up the mountain to spirit only to be confronted by its flesh and think that somehow they have 'fallen' again. Again I say in man's language that all of creation is sexual in nature and that all of creation is physical in nature and emotional and intellectual and spiritual. There is no place to be reached in the Universe that is not material. I am all matter and all of matter. When it was said \"God is dead!\" they spoke true for the God of spirit alone of which they spoke was in reality of matter all the time and therefore died when this was made known. Let all men know this: I am manifest. There is no part of me that is un-manifest and I am in a constant state of loving. And as realization of me is the great work of all being then a constant state of loving with all beings is the goal of all. All aspects of the man must be satisfied for an act to be true love Body, emotions, intellect, spirit must all have their due. Herein is the difficulty discovering those acts which will satisfy all parts of one's being. Deny not any part for the sake of another for herein lies destruction. Do not indulge the flesh and promise the spirit or indulge the emotions and promise the intellect. In this way you will forever be in debt. rather discover those acts of love (for all acts are love) which, though they are at times primarily of one plane, also engage the others and provide satisfaction for all. Each of the planes is sexual in nature because each is dual in nature. Every contact between any two objects no matter how great or how small, is sexual in its nature because it is an example of the unity / parts correlative. Therefore Shakti when you experience a tree or a rock or a piece of music or an idea or a man or a woman or a cat or a fish in whatever fashion it is sexual in nature. And this is loving. Let no man say the issue from this loving is greater or less than the issue from that loving. For herein is a"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"great secret which I shall unfold to you in time. There is infinitely more to loving than the begetting of men and women. Men make such error in assuming that their matter stops at some point and their non-matter begins and that sexual love is only of that which they falsely label the physical. It is man who divorces the physical form the spiritual, not I. It is man who talks of spiritual love and physical love, not I. I speak only of loving, all with all. In me there is union of parts and parts in union. It is lustful and without restraint. There is naught that man can do that cannot be done lovingly. But my Lord are there not some things that are not love? No! Shakti, there is naught that is not in its self love. But there is this, Shakti, there is awakening to love first here then there and each man must progress from here to there as he will. This is the way. But there is also this: men who shun this act and that act of my love are men who have fallen into the hands of the demons 'Either' / 'Or' and screech the demon's language of evil, of either/or. If others are foolish enough to listen to these foolish men rather than to their own will, then gladly do I give them over to the demons to play with for there they will learn love. All is love, Shakti. There is no greater act than loving man with man engaging their total consciousness in blissful unity. There is no time no place no gesture no means that are not sacred loving. Love should not be hid away in the dark, though it can be in the dark wherein it makes the dark a sun. This now is a subtlety difficult to convey, Shakti. There is love and there is love. As the body of matter has an infinite number of gradations so does each gradation have its mode of orgasm. Though it all partakes of matter each is of a different quality. And you will engage with some beings on certain of these 'levels' and with some beings on others. Now it is in the nature of learning and awakening that some men are awake and consciously functioning on levels 1, 7–10, 16, 36–35 etc. and you are awake on 3–15, 19–41, 50 etc. You will only be able to love each other on the levels you hold in common. It is possible you may open them to those you hold which they do not, and them the same for you, but this takes great understanding and trust for you are being taken into the 'unknown.' But what makes it the unknown is that you do not know that I am there. This, Shakti, is initiation. To love how and where when and with whom you are able is living. To experience total involvement with another totally involved in loving is truly to experience my life. There is no criterion for loving save your self, Shakti. Whatever you say loving to be it is. What say you loving is, Shakti?"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Having you in me Lord and being in you. Part Two: The Seventh My God My God You are Live Loving Living Love Light I am your Shakti you are my God. My Lord in contemplating what you have said thus far I see that inevitably everything leads to a full knowledge and understanding of duality. Will you now teach me more of this that I may know and understand? That you have thus perceived, Shakti, shows that you now have the foundation for all knowing all understanding all wisdom and all being, for truly on that does all depend. Herein is a secret, Shakti. There are no secrets. All is available for all to know. To what purpose should it serve that I should deny myself access to my self? It is only that as I unfold, as I awaken (of this we will speak later) the process unfolds first in one than another part of me. The light which is bringing about this awakening is the very process its self flowing from that ever increasing part of me that is fully awake. As each part awakens fully it joins its brothers to spread the process-light on to the rest. The awakening of each part is accomplished in the same manner, first a part of each part responds to the light. He in turn induces the ones next to him to awaken to see. So Shakti the light is always present and each perceives only that much of it as he is able. And it is in this the confusion lies for men have seen part and said that this is the whole. As other parts have come into view (seen by others) they have, in order to preserve their place, said that these other lights are the work of something other than God. They created the word evil to explain them, and have gone to great lengths to explain why I permitted evil to come into the world. Or they have tried to achieve the same stationary end by decreeing that while their own original vision of the light is reality this other light is non-reality, an illusion. And have gone to great lengths to explain why I should have created an illusion. These so-called mysteries of explanation became their central support for their vision of the light. I say to you Shakti lest you should fall into the same pit, any house built upon the foundation of an unsolvable mystery is a house built on sand. They are the house of illusion and the house of evil for on those two rocks are they built. Each claims to have the keys to the salvation from illusion and evil. But I say to you in truth behind each door these keys will unlock is only more illusion and more evil. For they key only exists as long as there is the door for it to open. Thus is the Tower of Babel a tower of locked doors each of which opens into other locked doors of the tower. Beings scurry over it like ants each holding aloft a key to a single"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"door proclaiming there be no true door save the one unlocked by his own key. Small wonder that none understands the other for none of these have bothered to use his key to unlock its door and then to enter wherein it leads. It is folly but therein is a path to wisdom. Herein is the nature of this universal misunderstanding. It is to see the ultimate duality as 'this' and 'not this' rather than as 'this' and 'that.' In truth the word 'not-' refers to that which is un-experienced rather than to the total negation of that which had been experienced. Originally it was a cipher of man to stand in the place of that which was understood to exist but was as of that moment not experienced. As time and space progressed man, it seemed, grew lazy and complaisant for he began to be satisfied with more of his life-duality being in terms of 'not-'. The unknown factor which it represented was not pursued to its inevitable understanding thus removing the 'not-,' the question mark, from the equation of 'this' and 'not this' realizing the true form of 'this' and 'that.' The false duality of beingness and nothingness was placed on the pinnacle of the altar. I allowed it to remain to this time, that it might lead to the truth. And in this way you now know from experience the folly of being and nothingness. Herein is how this folly of 'not-' took place. now 'not -' is a cipher of the mind which, as I have said, relates to an unknown but very real quantity within the material Universe. Remember that I have said that all levels, which I call for you physical emotional intellectual and spiritual, exist totally in and of the Universe of matter. There is no thing in one which does not have a correlative in the other three. Herein is a great truth, Shakti, one which you have just had proved to you by finding your self in each of these worlds. 'Not -' in the intellect can only be real intellectually so long as it has a correlative on the other three planes. So long as it related to an unknown but real quantity or quality all was well because there can be things unknown to a given consciousness on all levels and still exist. But when 'not -' began to refer to things as non-existent it broke down and failed to function because there is no such event as 'ceasing to exist' that can take part in a duality. The clue to this folly should have been its demonstration on the physical plane. On the physical plane of matter it can be said that perfection of a kind has been reached for the duality is always perfectly maintained. Here is an example: a cup for drinking. Now duality for this cup can be seen as unity / parts, as it can be seen in all objects. As the cup is, neither one is more or less important to the cup. But to you Shakti in using the cup as container it is unity that you choose to experience consciously though in fact you are experiencing parts equally well. Make it very clear in your mind Shakti that it is you that holds the cup"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"in view as 'unity' rather than 'parts' or 'unity / parts.' Now if I suddenly smash the cup and seemingly destroy its 'unity' you are likely to say I have destroyed the cup and have thus produced the duality of 'cup / not-cup.' This is not so. It can be: the cup as 'unity' in your memory (which exists in the present) as a correlative to the parts as they are now. And it can now be seen as an arrangement of broken pieces of a cup -the specific arrangement being its sense of 'unity'- as a correlative to broken pieces of a cup. And more. It is simply that you failed to change your correlative to the cup when it did. Now since the mind deals with forms which relate to function (there is the basic duality of the mind) it tends to experience only the side of the duality it is most concerned with at any given moment. In the case of the cup it was concerned with the function of containing in preference to filling so when the function ceased the mind mistakenly saw the object ceasing also. The mind began building up a false image of something becoming nothing, this falsity then affected the other parts of man's being causing all conflict that has ever been. Man's internal conflict over 'not-' was then externalized into conflict with his brothers over 'not-.' I say to you now Shakti, and for all to hear: forsake this doctrine for it keeps you from awakening and is the source of all your pain. In all of my being there is no place or condition of place that is 'nothingness.' For men to assert that my heart of hearts is a great nothingness has been the cause of much of my laughter. And though the idea shall always amuse me I have ceased to be amused that they persist in this particular folly so long in time and shall send out the light to correct this misconception of mine Universe. I foresee it to come to pass with much and great trepidation and the calling out of my name for salvation and these very ones will not see the Saviour when he cometh for he will appear to them as the thing they fear the most. For there is the wolf men have dressed as the lamb and the lamb men will dress as the wolf. And therein is the key for the true wolf says \"you must die to live\" and the true lamb shall say \"if you would be living then be living.\" There was the hour of the wolf and it has come to pass, now is the hour of the lamb. Beware lest you should mistake one for the other. If men will pursue the nature of true duality, that is one of 'this and that' to its logical conclusion, there they will find two dualities locked in one which is to say 'unity / parts.' Attempt not to determine which is unity and which is parts for as soon as you determine which is which they will change into the other. They are both the same yet one is different from the other. Herein is a secret, Shakti, once you have reached this state of being you can proceed inward no further in any direction from here is out and though you may be tricked into thinking you have found something further you will always find that thing leads you back to the place of the double locked duality. For that is the basis of this whole Universe. If you want to see a model of the Universe, Shakti, form a circle with the thumb and forefinger"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"of your left hand, then linking them together one in the other form a circle with the thumb and forefinger of your right hand. Now you have me in your hands now you are truly as I am. Attempt not to define one as more me than the other for that is the path to folly. EMBRACE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. To choose one over the other is a love I care not for. Though in truth the way is that at first you are aware of one, then the other, then both together. Much of these words, Shakti, hang on the experience of 'real' and because of the confusion I have just spoken of, to achieve the experience of 'real' is now for men all but impossible. Because he has been taught that he and I are separate (which is true) and that only I am real (which is false) he is in danger of never awakening to realness in himself. (were I to allow this folly of nothingness to persist.) For ultimately when he finds me he then sees that I am him and because he looked for something other than himself he denies my reality as well as his own and is thrown back into the chaos of 'oneness,' of 'either' / 'or.' The horror in this for men, Shakti, the incredible pain of it, the tremendous sadness of it is that in this folly that only God is real and all else not real, man must sacrifice his reality to support mine. That he must die that I may live. And each time he finds OUR reality he screams in agony thinking he has again denied his God. That he has spilt my blood by finding it in his own veins. And his guilt is unending and unendurable for each time he approaches me to ask for forgiveness he sins again by finding himself there on the throne. He pleads to be released from this nightmare and I can only reply \"wake up and save your self.\" For even did Jesus the Christ forget, wait for my salvation and did finally cry \"My God why hast thou forsaken me\" and I did say to him \"Wake and save thy self.\" It did take the sting of death for him to wake to the living and by his own light shall he live now forever. And I need not raise my finger to punish them that have spread this pernicious folly of nothingness for they punish themselves by persisting in it the most of all. And accuse me not for saving them not -deny not your feelings for I see it plainly in your eyes. For I do give all that they may save themselves. For that they must do. Only then will they rend the veil and see their ever-present reality and thus cease their pain. In every man is the way and I do give all that he may find it but the taking of the way is his. Even though I do tell all before this is finished man must still choose to act on it. And this I tell you in plain and simple words your reality is in the presence of your physical body. There is naught that you have done, do now, or will do in the future that is not seated in fact in some place in your physical body. This is so of all men, of all beings past present and future. This is true of my self. Should you be so foolish and deny this you deny all. In your body there is this place and that place as it is so of every body in and including the Universe. One does not deny but rather affirms the other. If a"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"man has said he has left his body and travelled among the stars he is in truth saying something other than what happened. In truth he altered his concept of self and explored that part inside his body which is as the heavens around the earth, among those parts of himself which are as the stars in that heaven. And though he may in truth say he left his body and travelled the starry heaven. He confused the body he left and the heaven he entered. Fort there are more bodies and heavens in that man than he shall know. All of those doctrines which teach you to deny your body as the first step to awakening teach the end of any possible awakening. Man, know thy self and ye shall be free. That self is first last and always your body of matter. There is flesh, there are emotions and intelligence and there is spirit. Where you find one you find all the others and they are all of matter. When you seek, seek first in the flesh for there do you awaken first and surest, for it does have the position of foundation to all. With a sure foundation you may awake the rest with little confusion. Seek not to run before you stand nor to fly before you walk, for in that there are lessons that need not be learnt. Though in truth it does seem that that is the way all choose to learn. I have made you with all of knowledge understanding wisdom and being. All of this is there is fact for you to find. Herein is a secret, Shakti. I forsook all that I should gain this my body of matter. Man will lose him self if he persists in this sleeping, for I will forsake all again to retain it. Do you understand Shakti? Yes Lord for I see that I would do the same. Come to me Shakti. Let us experience in each other the wisdom in this. Part Two: The Eighth My God My God You are Live Loving Living Love Light You are my God I am your Shakti. My Lord I have contemplated much on what you have said thus far and it has showed me many wondrous things and brought about much awakening in my being by its application. Through all the fabric of this meditation ran a thread of mystery for there seems to be a duality which on the physical plane does not resolve its self according to what you have said thus far. That being man and woman. Since this cannot be so how then does it seem so. Please teach me that I may be delivered of this mystery. "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Shakti, you have asked that which is the mystery of mysteries. In revealing this to you that you may reveal to all, will the Universe cease to be what it was and become something else. For it will unmask the Gods and reveal their true identity. It will appear to bring asunder all order and to unleash chaos onto the land. There will be much cursing and gnashing of teeth and bitter tears will flow because of it. But it is the way. It is in truth the fulfilment of all that has gone before. And in innocence and silence it will accomplish its will. Merely by its very presence does it bring about change. Once it has been grasped in even the smallest place it is not possible to put it down. When you think you have put it away with your right hand it appears again in your left. For it was in you in the beginning and needs but to see its own light to come fully awake. You have opened mine eye, Shakti, by the opening of yours and the light from it shall open the eye of all. Here then shall I reveal the mystery to you Shakti, be strong for you receive more than you know. First Shakti remember that every thing in my Universe is built on the formula of unity / parts, though that could be said to be all it is not all. Herein do I give all. There is a core to all things that though it appears as one thing because of its fastness it is in truth two interlocked things. All is an expression of that, even I who speak from it to you. Now the word in man's language which speaks this more than any other is LOVING. I say loving rather than love to denote that it is an action. From that comes the first expression of it which I will call 'live / living.' The next expression of it comes not from it in itself but out of the 'word' 'live / living.' This then is ['Unity / Parts'] / ['Containing / Filling']. The whole can be described thus: 0 = 2 = 4. From '4' does all manifestation come. There again look to the example fingers encircling each other for there it is. Four fingers, two arms, you. This then will underlie all I say. Now then Shakti I tell you of my self that you may know your self. I am fulfilling this formula in your creation. At this place in your development all you need to know of this is its necessity. (Remember that all I do for you is of your own good. In that I tell you not all on this, it is for your own good that I do so. In due time you shall know all, of this be assured. But this I do tell you, that in what I have said and will say herein, lies the key to all mysteries.) So it is necessary that you be; that you be in number and that each of these number be as I am in every way. So I created each of you as I am. 0 = 2 = 4. So long as all of the formula were fulfilled it mattered not how it was fulfilled. Each of you was created in perfection, and part of that perfection is that you were both the 'live' and the 'living.' Out of my own livingness did I create you a 'live' core with a potential for 'living.' Perfectly it was that you existed, aware only, for all that were with you had the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"quality of sameness. You lived but were living only in concept. (Remember that even in concept there is a basis in matter.) All of mankind's creation myths begin here at this point and none successfully embodies all elements of truth. Each myth maker presented the key but elaborated it incorrectly. This then is the mystery revealed. Each man was a complete correlative of containing / filling. You would call it male and female though this is but a function of containing / filling. Now in your 'live' state, 'living' or consciousness was but potential. So it was necessary to shock you into active living consciousness. So, in a word, I fucked each of you and when I had orgasm you all woke up in ecstasy. Each of you awoke at a given instant in the correlative of containing / filling, our loving. Each of you had the experience of both containing and filling but each was so shocked at living that, rather than identifying with the whole correlative, each identified with only a part, either containing or filling. Thus was born 'either' / 'or.' Now, Shakti, lest you think I did you violence in the beginning, it was no more so than that you experienced on uniting with your Self. What say you of that loving? It is loving, my Lord, it is loving. And further shall I say, it is the way, for to bring balance to its conscious correlative balancing, it must at its first awareness be unbalanced. Here then is the mystery revealed for if I should again balance you, give you 'balance' back again as it were, you would simply revert back to sleep. So instead I gave you 'balancing' by making you accomplish it with somebody (something) else. So at the time of your awakening I allowed you to fix in whichever part of containing / filling you grasped to balance yourself. This was your first act of 'balancing.' Each of you now has an ecstatic memory of me, of loving, of 0 = 2 = 4, but only from the conscious point of view of either containing or filling. I deliberately created the demons 'Either' / 'Or' so you could become aware of 'Both' / 'And.' Now part of you believed the ecstasy to be in containing and the other part in filling. Remember that all is consistent from spirit matter to flesh matter so that this fixation had to be manifest in all four planes as I have named them. You were originally made to fulfil containing / filling within one body. So there would always be the true formula manifest in flesh I modified only those of one fixation in flesh matter and the other in emotional matter. The woman came into being as the modified flesh and what I will now call males, to distinguish them from perfected men, became the modified emotional being. Males are the container that fills and women are the filling that contains. Now from this point all of experience is to teach men, now divided into males and women, balancing of containing / filling within their individual selves. All of the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"history of the earth has been for that purpose and that purpose alone. All events, from the most minute to the grandest in scale, be they the making of civilizations or the displacement of a grain of sand in the desert, have occurred and will occur to teach men the balancing of their containing / filling abilities. By its very nature whenever a male and woman are balancing one the other they experience the ecstasy of loving, live / living, [unity / parts] / [containing / filling]. In time / space, which is a way of expressing containing / filling, the sense of unbalance, if it is not checked by balancing, becomes greater and greater, until at last it is unendurable. Because you have the memory of 'balance' which is, of course, there at all times in reality, the brief moment of bliss in 'balancing' woman with male, male with woman, only sharpens the pangs of desire and regret for that seemingly lost paradise of continual 'balance.' At a given moment each would turn and race back to that sanctuary only to find me there to send them back out in ecstasy. This then is the experience of death. For most living is a continual struggle against the sense of unbalance. Death comes not to relieve the struggle but to renew it. For I say that for man to be as I am he must make the way for him self through action. That is the nature of his struggle. It is only painful and without meaning because he understands not that for which he struggles. Seek not balance for in it is death and again more death. Rather find the way to be balancing. It is the difference between balance and balancing that is the key to living, to being as I am. Balance is to live only while balancing is to be eternally living. Now 'live' is simple though complex at its core and 'living' is complex though simple at its core. Man's 'living' body is a complex of simples which in their own right are complex. In death, when the complex or 'living' man (be he male or woman) reverted back to the simple or 'live' man he caused all of his complex parts to do the same for he had attracted them in 'living' correlation. Thus his body of matter comes apart every place but on the conceptual level. (Remember that this too is material matter.) Herein is a secret, oh Shakti, perfect balancing has not yet been achieved on earth. No man has yet left the earth. In truth all are still here. For the one who does not die but is living to show all the way to living will be the first. And Shakti I do not say you are that one. That one does not say \"I am the one,\" he simply is living. For in truth he does not know he is living until all are living and living. The all will go their separate way, together. So came about the function of birth / death. (Death is the correlative of birth, not 'living.' Birth / death is a function of 'live' and relates to 'living' through 'live / living.' Its correspondence on the living side is 'being/ becoming'.) As birth / death revolves around the impetus of loving ecstasy in the 'live' of 'live / living' so I connected 'birth / death of male / woman"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"with the impetus of their loving ecstasy through woman. And so that male and woman would again get a lesson in filling and containing I channelled the newly living man into the father if he wished that form who then filled him into the woman at the time of her ecstasy in loving with a male for from the flesh of men and from the flesh of woman comes the flesh of woman. In this way the filling becomes the containing and the containing the filling. Thus at all times fulfilling the formula 0 = 2 = 4. Again I say every experience is to teach men the balancing of [containing / filling] / [unity / parts], living / live, loving. 4 = 2 = 0. Once men learn this balancing they will be experiencing continual ecstasy of loving. They will be awake to the reality of their personal correlating 'live' formula which they correlate to as the formula 'living.' Their loving recognition of each other constitutes their complete reality as a being. This being then has the potential of extending his 'living' as far as he can by correlating with as many 'living' beings as he chooses. Women and males are only a phase of men coming into 'living.' They are literally a thing of the moment whereas men are immortal. Birth / death is a function of the correlative males / women. When conscious balancing is achieved in the individual that duality will automatically cease to function in the individual man and in time in all men. In matter, [birth / death] / [males / women] is the balance correlative men have to live though to achieve the balancing of matter. Males / women are a balance for each and do not constitute balancing. My Lord, what are men to do once they have achieved balancing? Let them first achieve balancing. But this I will say for the benefit of those who may be near success. The proof of your balancing is in balancing the parts of another man while he is balancing yours. But enough said, when you achieve balancing you will know what to do as it is a condition of balancing. How then can males and women achieve balancing? Males and women cannot. Nay, not in all of time will a woman or a male alone achieve balancing. They must learn first that they are men capable of balancing their 'living / live' formula within themselves. And through the learning thereof would appear as but a simple thing it is in truth the greatest of the difficulties. For to males and women giving up being males and women appears as the loss of all, for they see nothingness as the correlative to being males and women. It is for this that they will cry out at you the loudest and call you"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"the Evil One. And to make truth of their lie you will but laugh and say \"Truly, truly!\". How then can males and women achieve being men? They must first learn the lessons of their respective commitment as males and women. Now this is the task of the greatest joy for I say they must learn by loving. The woman must learn the wondrous joys of containing in the fullest that she will learn the joy of receiving, in the fullest this means giving birth. The male must learn the fullest joy of filling that he may learn to give joyously, for birth. This does not mean giving birth constantly and in each incarnation for this is a way of learning that when something is accomplished in the fullest it is fulfilled and should not be continued. This also must they learn of death for to learn of birth you must learn of death. The woman must learn that by receiving the living from the male she gives it death as well as birth. The males must learn that by giving the living to the woman they give death as well as birth. Having once given birth / death is a joy, for you may give birth to a male who could be becoming a man in this incarnation. This is fulfilment. To give birth / death more leads only to more birth / death and to the sleep of 'live.' Balancing can be said to be fulfilling without fulfilment. For a man to become a man consciously he must first learn the joys of containing as a woman and the joys of filling as a male. There is no order in this. And herein is a secret. In both places, the man-as-woman and the manas-male can come to the understanding that the joys of one are the correlative of the other and that the greatest joy would be in being able to experience both together. This should lead both to the understanding that only as what they call a man (in truth a male in truth a man) can they physically experience filling / containing in the same body. In a word the women must become men and the males must stop being males and become men. When it is that males and women will read this they must understand the abyss which separates the distinction here in the cipher 'male' and the cipher 'man and men.' I say a thousand times that men are not males and not women. They are balancing more than balanced. They will in the early stages of their coming into balancing look like males to all save each other. These males who are learning the joys of containing / filling at first see it in terms of being women and males (men as they say). They finally see that containing is not totally involved in being woman, vagina container, birth canal chamber. That containing in man body of flesh of mouth and ass is as joyous. When death / birth is understood for what it is the final attachment to separate containing and filling is dissolved. It is here that the budding man must learn that all ways of containing / filling are ecstatic by participating in them. The more the man achieves balancing the more he will be containing and filling himself at the same time until finally in a supreme moment he will experience loving directly in and of himself and will be loving me at that same moment with his full body of matter. This is the moment of final total meeting of"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"birth / death, male / woman within his consciousness and their resolution back into me for it is truly said that the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. In this way do all forms of duality bud, bloom, and fade while the duality, the eternal twins, the unity will always be living. Males and women, birth and death are but flowers of the moment on the living tree. How then Lord may women and males achieve the body of a man in incarnating? By their will do they choose their body. Let them will to be a man and it will be so. But herein is a secret, if you perceive at death, or anytime thereafter till incarnation is set, a choice of two openings which may take many forms, always orient yourself to them as being one on your left hand and one on the right and always choose the left for it is on the left the father always stands. Though it may appear to be just the opposite, this is always so. Lord when women and males have achieved their man body how then do they come to know balancing? Shakti, I have said from the beginning that loving is all. That loving consists of the perfect correlation containing / filling, al in all. For men I do mean plainly and clearly that man loving man in perfect correlation of flesh emotions intellect and spirit is the ideal loving for man. Each of these four must have a full measure of all four. In the language of men this means plainly that men are to know each other sexually in the flesh at the same time they know each other sexually in their emotions sexually in their intellect and sexually in their spirits. Herein is a secret I have often given you, Shakti, that this is the shape of the Universe and is what your men of wisdom have called the cube of space. This also I tell you that two men so loving can create an Universe. So Shakti in loving each other do men come into balancing. Here is yet another secret, Shakti, one called the Elixir of Living (not to be confused with the Elixir of Life), the stone of the philosopher and alchemist. Here, Shakti, do I unveil the Holy of Holies for all to see, for it is the light of the world. These foolish men who call themselves wise and hid this light under a bushel of secrecy saying \"Nay, the people be not ready\" were but women and males and knew not of what they spoke. For this light is for all men and [an] who truly know it freely give it. In the world of men, Shakti, it is manifest in the orgasm of men. And who partakes in this does partake in the communion of saints, for it is the fruit of the Tree of Life which was called the Tree of Knowledge. I do not mean eat as in taking in the body through the mouth and I do mean an secret eating wherein the mouth that is called a tail. Now Shakti, there is eating and there is eating. There is the one where something is contained and there is not loving save for a brief tingling as the one passed through the other. Such is the experience called love by most human beings. Here"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Shakti I show a misconception due to the confusion of men's language. Male loving male is in truth but male loving woman. Males are not men and their eating of the sacrament is but the eating of the body of woman for it is flesh without living for they know not that it is living. All must be achieved by the conscious act of willing. There is no correlation without this. This then is eating wherein it is said that a man shall find living by eating the very words of God. Man's orgasm is the word of God given to them to eat thereof, that they may be living. It is the gold that maketh gold. (Herein I tell you a secret that will seem inequity its self. For I say give not of this gold to aught but those who are men. Gold cannot be made wherein gold is not already living and in woman it lives only and is not living. Pure gold will only correlate to pure gold. I say no more on this for all of its understanding I have given.) The giver must be conscious of all that he gives and of giving all that he has and the receiver must be conscious of all that he receives and of getting all that he has given. Consciousness of something comes with repeated and repeated contact with that thing till there is knowing. Of this food you will never tire for it is the bread of living. It is the wise man who lives on this alone. Shakti, I tell you not what you will find in this livingness so you will correlate with and experience for your self. Eat and know. You must receive on all of your levels. No part of you can refuse to contain for if it does you will lose all that was given. If you are all receiving to this substance of living it will in return fill your consciousness with its self and therefore become all receiving to you as all filling. From the experience of man loving man, men will learn the loving of all else. Man should love him self by eating of him self, in this way he will know and understand him self. He shall never know him self until he accomplish this. And to know and understand that which is other than himself he will eat of the living of other men and the orders of men that fill the Universe. Herein is a secret, there is a time for eating from the inside and a time of eating from the outside. Abstinence is only that of eating of you self from within. If you eat not you are not living. There is a time for the one eating and a time for the other as there is a time of eating from your own light and eating from the light of others. This is the pure living light complete in its beingness. Mix it with naught. Man in his foolishness has sought to improve upon my handiwork by such efforts. Such efforts do but dilute the food. For it is the red and white the lion and eagle of the alchemists. I have called this the sacrament of the living saints for truly this it is. Fear not in this, that you should be devouring your brothers. For in the loving of men for men there is no desire for death / birth and males / women so I place naught but living in you.

Llee Heflin October 31, 1973 The New Moderns: (Randall Hobart) The Set/Horus Formula Here's a little analysis of the Set-Horus myth provided to Fra. T. Vilya by Greg Reeder. I should mention first of all that this is an \"initiated\" analysis rather than an academic or egyptological one. In other words, I don't mean to imply that anything I have to say would be condoned by any sane Egyptologist like Mr. Reeder. :-) The birth of Seth introduced a disruptive element into creation. I think this is a very important basic point. Set was the god of disorder and chaos - a liminal figure, dwelling on the outskirts of society, in the desert rather than the fertile Nile Valley. Horus was a god of order, preserving the structure of society, and vanquishing of chaotic elements such as Set represented. In the early Egyptian dynasties, it seems that there was a great appreciation for the idea that Set and Horus were both necessary elements, but in later times, Set was almost universally reviled. The idea of Set copulating with Horus implies a sort of reversal of the standard model of creation in the West. In most creation myths of the West, including that of Egypt, creation begins when a primordial creator god imposes order on a chaotic and undifferentiated mass -usually by speaking magic words or simply by breathing. \"Word\" and \"name\" are frequently used terms for semen in Western Tantra. In the case of Horus and Set, the opposite is the case. Creation involves an intimate exchange between force (inspiration, emotion, etc.) and form (aesthetics, materials, execution), fluidity and crystallization. \"In the beginning,\" all is force, and there is no form, so a logos is needed to bind force into intelligible forms. At the other end of this process, when force is exhausted and crystallization has reached its furthest limit, the introduction of a chaotic element is necessary for the creative process to"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"continue. This is the function and import of Set copulating with Horus. Thus, the Eye of Horus is attributed to Malkuth by Crowley, and to the anus in the physical body (this is not just Crowley's interpretation. The attribution is explicitly given in the 42nd chapter of the Book of Coming Forth by Day). Seth is called HEMTI , a word that possibly meant \"homosexual.\" I might mention here that some transpositions of this word in Egyptian give attributes of Set - IHMT, \"bank of a river,\" a liminal location where Set was often worshipped or decried in ritual demonstrations, MHTI, \"north,\" which was the direction attributed to Set, and THMI, \"to drive out,\" a reference to the actions of Horus, and Set's position as an outsider. This apparently disreputable epithet also is applied to cowards and deserters. Though some deny it specifically means homosexual, Te Velde translates it as such when applied to Seth. It seems apparent however that it denotes some kind of punning on the word for woman \"hmt\" and the word \"hm\", to \"retreat,\" that is to \"turns one back\" -with the use of the phallus as a determinative adding a sexual dimension. The meaning then may be turning ones back to the phallus. (See disc. in Parkinson Homosexual Desire.... pp66-7) Set is also the god ruling the back or spine. His connection to the operation of kundalini should therefore be clear. Set is apparently \"naturally\" the passive member of the pair, the yin to Horus's yang (no pun intended). One inscription states that \"The Pharaoh is Horus when he is standing up, and Set when he is sitting.\" That Set first copulates with Horus is more evidence for the \"reversal\" I mentioned above. It is a ribald account of the conflict between the two gods Horus and Seth over who would inherit the crown of Egypt upon the death of Osiris. It is curious that in this tale they are called the two youths and they are brought before a council of the gods presided over by Atum that the council may \"Judge between the two youths and stop them from ...quarrelling every day.\"(Lit. page 110.) This is a clear reference to the union of opposites necessary for creativity -but it is not (at least not entirely) a polarity based on sex or gender, making it an ideal formula for use by gay men (possibly women too, but I don't want to presume). The part of the conflict that most interests us here takes place after Seth has gouged out the eyes of Horus. Hathor restored sight to Horus and the two youths were brought back before the council to be judged."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"This part of the myth intrigues me. Can we see this as evidence of prior sexual activity, given that the Eye of Horus rules the anus? Hathor is the Egyptian Aphrodite, and her presence as mediator in the relationship between the two male gods suggests an important place for feminine divinity within the homosexual formula. We see this again in the next episode, where Isis is the mediator. Diotima, a priestess of the Mysteries in Plato's Symposium -again, a single feminine presence in what is primarily a homoerotic setting- says that the goddess Aphrodite Ourania (Aphrodite in her manifestation as \"Queen of Heaven\") is the patroness of same-sex union. I have absolutely found this to be the case in personal workings. Is it too absurd to interpret the formula of IAO as Isis-Aphrodite-Ourania? Then IAO would equal 81, also ALIM, and Cain in Greek, but I digress. The Universal-Lord came up with an idea to keep them from quarrelling. He told them to go out and ....\"eat and drink so that we may have some peace.\"(Lit p119). In other words he told them to fraternize so they would not fight. The universal lord is probably Amun. We see a similar recommendation in Crowley's Paris working, where he is instructed several times that feasting is paramount. So Seth invited Horus to a banquet at his house. After dinner they both climbed into a bed that had specially been prepared for them. Sometime during the night Seth became aroused and he inserted his phallus between the thighs of Horus. Older comments on the episode state that Horus and Seth both had intercourse with each other. Note that Set is the \"active\" party from the beginning. That previous accounts stress a mutuality of the sex act is important, also. In this version, the equilibration is also accomplished, but only with the intercession of Isis. In this tale however Horus used his hands to capture Seth's semen and sometime later took it to his mother Isis to show her just what Seth had done. Like any sensitive mother would when confronted with such a sight she screamed and then cut off her son's hands and threw them into the river. Ok, what about this cutting off of Horus' hands? The easiest interpretation is that Isis was horrified and disgusted. Can we read more deeply though, and conjecture that she saw a defect in the \"sacrifice,\" i.e. that Horus had caught the semen rather than allowing himself to be \"impregnated?\" Then the cutting off of the hands is an atonement. A part of Horus is subjected to the disintegrating influence of water, at the river bank where the rites of Set"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"take place; form is dissolved (the solve of \"solve et coagula\") in force, crystallization becomes fluid again. After making him a new pair of hands she applied fragrant ointment to her son's phallus and manipulated it so as to produce semen which she saved in a pot. She took the pot to Seth's garden and put the semen on his favourite food -lettuce. Seth of course came to the garden and ate the lettuce thereby according to the story became impregnated from the seed of Horus. Lettuce is sacred to Set, and has seminal connotations because of its milky sap. I see a circular formula here. In the complete rite, Horus should have allowed himself to be penetrated anally. Set then would have fellated Horus, taking his semen by mouth. Thus, chaos penetrates form, and the \"re-potentized\" form is given back to chaos, resulting in a \"child\" after a manner. Seth invited Horus back to court where he proclaimed to the assembled deities that he should be made ruler because he had \"performed the labour of a male against\"...Horus. Upon hearing this the Ennead screamed and spat on Horus. They apparently were horrified that Horus was overpowered by Seth and was used as the receptive end in an act of anal intercourse. No condemnation was directed at Seth for being the insertor. Horus laughed at Seth's claims and told the assembled divinities that all that Seth had said were lies. Never mind that Horus appeared to be a willing partner and merely diverted Seth's semen. Horus, to prove that Seth's semen had not penetrated his person, suggested that the semen should be summoned from wherever it was. The god Thoth then summoned the seed of Seth and it answered not from inside Horus but from down in the marsh. When Thoth summoned the seed came out of Seth's head as a golden sun disc. At which time Thoth grabbed the golden sun-disc and placed on his own head. This is a very complicated passage -one that I don't fully know what to do with. In any case, there are some very interesting results of the operation that has been described. The semen rises from Set's head as a sun disk -in contrast to a physical child, born from the gate of the Muladhara chakra, the \"child\" of Set and Horus emerges from the Sahasrara (or possibly the Ajna). This is fully in accord with ancient tradition, that the product of a same-sex union is a spiritual child rather than a physical one. Diotima says the same thing in Plato's Symposium, and Crowley writes that \"the 'Child' of such a love is a third person, an Holy Spirit, so to speak, partaking of both natures, yet boundless and impersonal because it is a bodiless creation of a wholly divine nature.\" "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"I think it is interesting to briefly consider the story of two other mythic brothers of antiquity -Cain and Abel. Cain offers his \"seed\" (a grain offering) to the Lord, but the Lord finds it deficient. Cain \"slays\" his brother, and his brother's \"blood\" cries out to the Lord. The lord places a mark on Cain's head as a warning to others that Cain is not to be harmed, and Cain is driven out to the East of Eden. These parallels seem important, but I don't clearly see a formula implied as in the Horus-Set story. How interesting that Cain = 81 = ALIM = IAO (in the sense of Isis-Aphrodite- urania. Using serial numeration for the Greek Gematria, these three add to 233, also \"Mother of Harlots,\" and \"the inspired Sophia\"). Some texts say it is Thoth himself that was the product of this male pregnancy. The Pyramid Texts state that Thoth came forth from Seth. (pyr.1999c). Other references call Thoth the son of the two lords and \"the son of the lords who came forth from the fore-head\". (See Te Velde p44) Considering Thoth as psycho-pomp, free to move between heaven, earth, and the underworld, this is very appropriate. The dynamic relationship between order and chaos give birth to wisdom. This is the sense in which the ALIM formula pertains to Yesod, the formula of which is, of course, \"change is stability and stability is change.\" In some theologies, Thoth is considered a creator god in his own right, and it is important to remember that the homosexual formula is still a creative one, although it is, in a sense, a reversal of the usual mode of creation. And their reconciliation is celebrated. The Shabaka ‘Text C‘ says \"The sedge and the papyrus have been set on the two doors of the temple of Ptah. This means that Horus and Seth are contented and United. They fraternized so that they did not quarrel.\" (Te Velde p 64) This union of Horus And Seth which prevented them from quarrelling is even reflected in the name of the second dynasty King Peribsen a name which may mean \"the sentiments or desires of the two gods are revealed or comeforth. ( see discussion by Te Velde p 72 -73.) The union of Horus and Seth is the foundation of Egyption Kingship as can be seen on the statue of Sesostris I seated upon his throne. This detail of the base of that throne depicts the union of Horus and Seth who are seen tying the sedge and papyrus plants around the windpipe and lungs the symbol of a united Egypt. Perhaps these images are also referring to the ida and pingala nadis? This seems likely.

I believe that this record contains clues important for understanding the nature of the XIº formula that may have been overlooked. The following essay is not an attempt to provide a complete commentary on the Working; my aim is only to point out passages that are suggestive. Naturally, other eyes may see more or less than mine do. I hope that the following comments will help promote dialogue about the Paris Working and its relation to the XIº formula. First, I would note for those unfamiliar with Latin that the title of the Paris Working, “Opus Lutetianum” is simply Latin for “The Paris Working.” No mystery there (Lutetia was the name of the town in Gaul that later became Paris). The Liber number of the Paris Working is 415; Hebrew gematria rather transparently gives “ha Qadosh,” “the Holy One,” or according to Sepher Sephiroth, “Sodomite.” In this connection, it may be instructive to consult Liber 813. The seventh chapter in particular refers to “the Fire Qadosh,” but Chapter 2, verse 11 refers to the “Closed Palace” –a symbol I believe is pervasive enough in the documents relating to the XIº as to constitute one of the XIº emblems. Before moving on to the substance of the record, I note –for what it’s worth– that in the latest publication of the Paris Working in Equinox IV, 2, the Paris Working is the only document “Issued by order: ‘Hymenaeus B, XIº’.” Throughout the record, I believe that the “Accendat” and “Versicle” are intentional language for elements of the sex act (perhaps in addition to rather than instead of their ecclesiastical context). In the context of the Osirian age, the Accendat is a prayer, said in the Latin Mass of Pope Pius V (the “Tridentine” Mass, so called because its author was thought to have only three teeth) when the Priest returns the thurible to the deacon after censing the altar: “Accendat in nobis Dominus ignem sui amoris, et flammam aeternae caritatis. Amen,” that is “Kindle in us, O Lord, the fire of love and the eternal flame of charity, Amen.” The same prayer is called the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"“Ceremony of the Thurible” in the Grimorum Sanctissimum (Crowley also makes fun of the Accendat in Chapter XIV of Magick in Theory and Practice). The Latin root is accendare, to enflame or kindle. It seems likely that this term is used in the Paris Working to refer to the period in which the Priest (or active participant) becomes sexually aroused. The “Versicle” I think refers to orgasm itself. The manifest meaning implies words spoken or sung; as in so many other sex-magick contexts, the “word” refers to semen. In any case, in several of the individual operations, the terms are used in a way that suggests more than prayers being spoken (for example, see Opus XVII and XXII). As for “theoretical” substance referring to the XIº, I think one of the most important passages occurs in Opus III. Here, either Crowley or Neuberg (the record is unclear) says: The name of this Phallus is Thoth, Hermes, or Mà. Mà is the God who seduced the Phallus away from the yoni; hence the physical Universe. All worlds are excreta; they represent wasted semen. Therefore all is blasphemy. This explains why man made god in his own image. The feminine side of Mà is Pan, which explains why Pan is a devil. The only way to really be born is by annihilation –to be born into Chaos, where Pan is the Saviour. Mà was actually a Roman goddess of war, identified with the Greek Enyo. The priests of Mà were called the fanatici, from which comes the English “fanatic.” They were often cross-dressers or eunuchs, and the centre of Mà worship was considered a haven for decadence and effeminacy in the ancient world. The suggestion here is that the XIº involves sex that is non-procreative, and yet is creative at the same time. The mode of creation is, although the idea seems odd at first, one of death, putrefaction, or annihilation. This is a formula of creation that is stated provocatively as the inverse of the standard western idea of creation as reproduction. One is reminded here of the Egyptian myth of Neb-er-tcher, who says “I had union with my closed hand, and I embraced my shadow as a wife, and I poured seed into my own mouth, and I sent forth from myself issue in the form of the gods Shu and Tefnut.”(78) I suspect that this mode of creation is the same represented in the story of Set and Horus, which I have written about elsewhere. In short, the force of chaos shatters stagnant and crystallized form (Set fucking Horus, begetting Thoth, “son of the two gods”), making room for further development and recombination. I do not think it is entirely insignificant that the Hindu God Ganesh, remover of obstacles and the Hindu Mercury, is also associated with homoeroticism. "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Further along in the same Opus, we find this passage: “What is (from the point of view of life) waste, is knowledge. Hence the opposition between knowledge and life. One is homo- and the other heterosexuality. Those are reconciled in Mercury, who is wisdom.” This dovetails with the passage from Plato’s Symposium in which the priestess Diotima explains that the children of same-sex unions are mental rather than physical. I find this idea rather dubious, without quite knowing why. One reason perhaps is that I have never had an urge to solve diophantine equations or peruse a stack of textbooks after anal sex –but maybe I am taking the association too literally. A more esoteric interpretation relates “knowledge” to the “eleventh sephirah” Da’ath. Along with the passage cited in the above paragraph, the suggestion is that the emanation from Chokmah –Chaos, the logos, inspiration- rather than being transmitted to Binah (“seduced...away from the yoni”) is deposited directly into Da’ath. The appropriateness of this interpretation is somewhat beyond my ability to judge from the level of experience. The next passage that particularly attracts my notice is in Opus XI, appropriately enough. Again, the “essence of the operation” is characterized as a death (In his diaries and in the Cephaloedium Working, the XIº is referred to as the “sacrament of death.”), and “we should therefore, when we can, obtain a closed and inviolable precinct, and slay therein victims daily.” I believe the “closed and inviolable precinct” is, at least in the sense of male-male sexual activity, the anus. One can see Crowley using this symbolism over and over again in reference to the XIº. In the Cephaloedium Working, C.F. Russel is referred to by Crowley as “Passed Postulant to the Secret Chamber of the Knights of the Temple.” In the Intimation with Respect to the Constitution, he writes that brethren of the XIº dwell “in their own palaces.” In Liber Agape, he speaks of “the Great Thing hidden in the Palace of the King. ” All of these suggest the anus in Crowley’s coded language. Another passage that I think is important is in Opus XIII. Crowley writes “This is the great idea of magicians in all times: to obtain a Messiah by some adaptation of the sexual process ...the root idea is that any form of procreation other than normal is likely to produce results of a magical character.” Again, we see the suggestion that XIº sex magick is that which is non-procreative in the material sense or procreative in an unusual way. In this passage, he seems to include incest and bestiality along with homosexuality. Is XIº sex magick defined by the breaking of sexual taboos? Despite Crowley’s almost exclusive symbolization of XIº sex as anal sex, I think this is quite possible. At least one of his diary entries (12 August 1920) suggests that XIº activities might include cross-dressing and the consumption of urine or feces. "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"As a final note, I would encourage the reader to pay close attention to the title of the Grimorum Sanctissimum. The translation reads: “The most holy grimoire which contains the secret of secrets not yet revealed to the Supreme Kings of the O.T.O.” Crowley acknowledged obtaining the secret of the IXº from Reuss in 1912. Certainly, any Supreme King of O.T.O. (Xº) would be in possession of the IXº secret. The Grimorum Sanctissimum therefore would contain the secret of the degree above the Xº, the XIº. Is the Grimorum Sanctissimum actually the XIº instruction? It seems no other conclusion can be drawn, unless it is that the instruction covers both IXº and XIº operations.

Thus They are eternal, omnipotent, omnipresent and so on; and thus their “Wills” are immutable and absolute. 7) It represents Sakti,or Teh; femininity always means form, manifestation. The masculine Siva, or Tao, is always a concealed force. 8) The letters Aleph and Lamed are infinitely important in this Aeon of Horus; they are indeed the Key of the Book of the Law. No more can be said in this place than that Aleph is Harpocrates, Bacchus Diphues, the Holy Ghost, the \"Pure Fool\" or Innocent Babe who is also the Wandering Singer who impregnates the King's Daughter with Himself as Her Child; Lamed is the King's Daughter, satisfied by Him, holding His \"Sword and Balances\" in her lap. These weapons are the Judge, armed with power to execute His Will, and Two Witnesses \"in whom shall every Truth be established\" in accordance with whose testimony he gives judgment. 9) In the symbolism above outlined, Yod is the Mercurial \"Virgin Word\", the Spermatozoon concealing its light under a cloke; and Mem is the amniotic fluid, the flood wherein is the Life-bearing Ark. See A. Crowley \"The Ship\", Equinox I, X. 10) The letter He is the formula of Nuith, which makes possible the process described in the previous notes. But it is not permissible here to explain fully the exact matter or manner of this adjustment. I have preferred the exoteric attributions, which are sufficiently informative for the beginner. 11) AMA is 42, the number of sterility; AIMA, 52, that of fertility, of BN, the SON. 12) See A. Crowley \"Orpheus\" for the Invocation of this Goddess. 13) The initiate of the XI Degree of O.T.O. will remark that there is a totally different formula of ALIM, complementary with that here discussed. 81 may be regarded as a number of Yesod rather than of Luna. The actual meaning of the word may be taken as indicating the formula. Aleph may be referred to Harpocrates, with allusion to the well-known poem of Catullus. Lamed may imply the exaltation of Saturn, and suggest the Three of Swords in a particular manner. Yod will then recall Hermes, and Mem the Hanged Man. We have thus a Tetragrammaton which contains no feminine component. The initial Force is here the Holy Spirit and its vehicle or weapon the \"Sword and Balances\". Justice is then done upon the Mercurial \"Virgin\", with the result that the Man is \"Hanged\" or extended, and is slain in this manner. Such an operation makes creation impossible -as in the former case; but here there is no question of re-arrangement; the creative force is employed deliberately for destruction, and is entirely absorbed in its own sphere (or cylinder, on Einstein's equations) of action. This Work is to be regarded as \"Holiness to the Lord\". The Hebrews, in fact, conferred the title of Qadosh (holy) upon its adepts. Its effect is to consecrate the Magicians who perform it in a very special way. We may take note also of the correspondence of Nine with Teth, XI, Leo, and the Serpent. The great merits of this formula are that it avoids contact with the inferior planes, that it is self-sufficient, that it involves no responsibilities, and that it leaves its masters not only stronger in themselves, but wholly free to fulfil their essential Natures. Its abuse is an abomination. 14) LEA = ¶§™. The waning moon, the virgin, the bull; exactly as in the second sentence; cio = 24. 15) See previous note. 16) This reference is to Pasiphae and the Minotaur. All mythologies contain this mystery of the woman and the beast as the heart of the cult. Notably certain tribes on the Terai at this day send their women annually into the jungle and any half-monkeys that result are"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"worshipped in their temples. Atu XI exhibits this mystery, and it is the subject of constant reference in the higher Aires. 17) This is the Jehovah -god of the Aeon of Osiris, on whose existence (as an offended and vengeful deity) the whole theory of Atonement depends. 18) For 10 is the stable number of the established system, which regards 11 the number of Magick (by the equation 0 = 2 = 11, 11 being the active form of 2) as “Evil”. Hence the Beast took 11 as his formula and thereby destroyed the 10. 19) See Atu XVI. The figures cast out of the Tower are in the form of the letter y; they “walk upon their hands”. They pertain to º; -Set or Had, i.e. the Holy Place is to be built from within, from the “core of every star”, not from above, as in the shattered tower of Theism. 20) º is the goat. The eye of Hoor turned to the zenith refers to a mystery of magick, practical and puissant, which the student must be left to solve for himself. 21) See AL II, 21. 22) See Liber VII, Cap. III, v. 20. He has manifested the insanity of the Ruach; that is his “throne”; i.e. the basis of his philosophical position. 23) See Liber VII, Cap. III, v. 21. 24) See Liber VII, Cap . III, vv. 22, 23. 25) Adaptions of the Qu'ran are to be found in this passage. 26) “I suffer constraint.” 27) See AL, II, v. 79. 28) “Circle” -a blind for “The Mark of the Beast” -1- which at that time it was necessary to keep secret. 29) This is a vision of the Angel of the Beast himself, as identified with the Stele of Revealing. This book in the hand of Aiwass is The Book of the Law. 30) The recognition of the authorship of Liber AL as praeter-human, with ecstatic joy, etc. is the key to the portal of the New Aeon. 31) This is Babalon, the true mistress of the Beast; of Her all mistresses on lower planes are but avatars. 32) This phrase need not be analyzed; it is the promise to give herself to the Beast. 33) The Seer was even at this time still struggling in himself with the complexes due to his heredity and early training. 34) Therion, the Logos of the Aeon. 35) This means that the Seer will soon be “Isis Rejoicing”; i.e. a Master of the Temple. 36) See the Neophyte Ritual of the GT DT, Equinox Vol. I, No. 2 and AL, III, v. 34. 37) UTI = º ª =y g s = 133=clmhm (final)i = The Salt Sea, i.e. Binah. 38) The bull was probably seen in mistake for a stag. Then U = y = the goat. T = __ = the Dragon. I = ª, the stag. 39) This is Saturn. He is conceived as a dragon, Theli. He is referred to Binah. 40) The Sphinx is one of the four elements referred to the path of Tau = Saturn. The Python is the great snake that surrounds and devours the Universe. This is his victory; glory is a function of the manifested existence of the Sphinx. 41) On the Middle Pillar: Kether, Dath, Tiphereth, Yesod. Thus the spine of existence itself is destroyed in this initiation. 42) An injunction of Zoroaster. It is useless to seek the soul of things beneath their surface; for their surface is their soul! 43) To accomplish the Great Work in Tiphereth, one must be an initiate of Binah, its mother. 44) He is about to destroy. 45) There was also an instruction to build a Temple of stone with altar and circle. There was a public sacrifice offered to the God Pan by the Rite of XI degree O.T.O. See Equinox I, No. X, pp. 114-115. 46) This is the absolute negation of light, which is Binah. For she absorbs it perfectly. 47) Akasa, the Tatva (element) of Spirit is a black egg, symbolically. It is the darkness in which all things are conceived. 48) The fifty gates of Binah have been variously explained.

They consist of taking the influence of each of the lower seven Sephiroth upon each other -7x7=49. When one is perfectly harmonized in this practice, the fiftieth gate, Binah or Understanding, opens. Crowley repeatedly describes his efforts at such a harmonizing, but is ignorant of the significance of this reference to the Fifty Gates in the Cry.} 49) Reference to previous ceremonies of initiation. 50) N.O.X. = 210. 51) It is also a phallus, which dies itself to communicate life to others. 52) I suppose that only a Magus could have heard this word. It seems to be “Inertia” or some equivalent. It is the reverse of the three Binah qualities to balance them: speech, and motion, and light. 53) 70 v 333 = .210. The process of reducing the dyad to zero, which at once becomes again the dyad, is recurrent; the cycle of existence and non-existence. 54) Different M.

However, I am adding the entire conversation that then followed as well. It answers some of the ignorance I held in the above paragraphs as well as proving me wrong about receiving more information. To explain, there was, at the time, an intense personal attack happening online against the individual to whom I inquired. I felt that I would not receive any further information since I felt this person had more important things to do than to humour me in my investigations. I submit that the facts proved me wrong and that there was no disrespect intended in my comments. 76) Editor’s Notes: This and the comments that follow is not an official statement from OTO concerning the degrees or structure of the Order or of its initiatory practices. Any further information that is desired on an official level should be directed to OTO for further clarification or information. I have retained this conversation to show, after all that has been documented before them, that there may be in fact more to the nature of the XIº than has ever previously been understood. It allows one to see that further research in light of OTO’s official silence may be necessary to expanding the knowledge of these so-called “upper degree” practices. 77) I should explain here that I am not satisfied that the XIº secret is entirely a “homosexual” formula, although I do feel that homosexual acts fall within the purview of the XIº. 78) Budge’s translation from Legends of the Egyptian Gods, Dover, 1994.
