It collects various documents for the benefi t of initiates, concerning the dignity of the degree prior to its incorporation in the system of M∴M∴M∴. The ritual precedent for the degree in our system is provided by the following sources:•Knight of the East and West, or Knight of the West, being the 17° of the Ancient and Accepted Rite•Knight of the Orient, being the 10° of the Antient and Primitive Rite•Knight Prince of the East and West, being the 17° of the Rite of MemphisA.C.F. Jackson, an historian of the Ancient and Accepted Rite for England and Wales, writes in his book Rose Croix, that The origin of this [Knight of the East and West] degree is not known. It probably appeared about 1762 with the increase in degrees caused by the schism in the Knights of the East by Peny, or it may have been one of the degrees produced by Pirlet’s Emperors of the East and West. From its title, the latter seems to be the most likely. It is suggested that it was of Templar origin, in which case its early roots may have been in the Rite of Strict Observance in Germany. According to Mackey, the degree started as a non-masonic Crusader Order which he attributes—almost certainly incorrectly—to Chevalier Ramsay. (p. 234)In England, from Crowley’s day to the present, the Ancient and Accepted Rite evidently have not worked the degree; instead they have simply conferred it by name in their Chapters of the Rose-Croix. Neither does the Memphis Rite appear ever to have worked the degree with any zeal, despite its inclusion in their codices. The degree does appear to have seen more service in the Ancient and Accepted “Scottish” Rite jurisdictions of the U.S.A., but I have not been able to verify its use or disuse under the Cerneau Supreme Councils and Sovereign Grand Commanders from which O.T.O. authority first descended.

KNIGHTS OF THE EAST & WESTEditor’s NoteThis is the full ritual from the twenty-fi ve degree system promulgated by Stephen Morin, often referenced as the “Rite of Perfection” (although that name properly pertains only to the fi rst 14 degrees), which served as the basis for the Ancient and Accepted Rite. Henry Andrew Francken was a Grand Inspector and Deputy Inspector General appointed by Morin. The rituals of the Francken manuscripts refl ect the form of the constituent degrees during the period in which they were codicized, prior to the later edits and reforms of Carson, Gourgas, Yates, Pike, and others. The present text is drawn from the 1783 MS.OriginWhen the Knts & Princes Called them selves to Conquer ye & Princes Called them selves to Conquer ye & Princes Called them selves to Conquer y Holy Land, they took a Crohs to distinguish them, as a mark of being under the Banner, and they took an oath, to spend the last drop of blood to establish the true religion.The peace being made, they could not fulfi ll their vow, & therefore returned to their own respective Countries, and resolved to do by theory what they could not do by practice; and never to admit in their Ceremonies any but those who had given proofs of friendship Zeal & discretion.They Joyned at Malta by having a Connection with them relative to masonry, and they took the name of Knts of East & West, princes of Jerusalem, to teach all the world where that order began, and never changed any wise their Customs and receptions.In the year 1118, the fi rst Knts to the number of Eleven took their vows between the hands of Garinouspatriarch and & prce of Jerusalem.Ceremony, when a Reception1stThe grd Counl of Knts of East & West, must be red, Spread with Stars of Gold. 2dIn the East a Canopy Elevated by 7 Steps, Supported by 4 Lions or Eagles, and between them an animal of the Human kind with 6 wings – 3don one side of the Throne the Sun, and on the other the Moon, made light by transperance, and under a Rainbow, and below this a bason with perfumed water, and a Skull. 4thEach Side South & North are 11 Small Canopies Elevated by 3 Steps for the venerable antients —opposite the Throne in the West 2 canopies, elevated by 5 Steps, for the 2 antient offi cers, who act as wardens – 5thA full grd Council must be composed of 24 Knts.

Under the Seal of the K.E.W. Degree of M∴M∴M∴8Regarding Pryse’s“A P O C A LY P S E U N S E A L E D ”Editor’s NoteIt does not appear that Crowley ever drafted a full ritual of initiation to the dignity of the degree of Knight of the East and West. The ritual used in Mysteria Mystica Maxima today is the work of his heirs and successors. However, Thelema already has strong symbolic resonance with the Apocalypse of the Seer of Patmos, which is assessed in the following Crowley quotes:The seers in the early days of the Aeon of Osiris foresaw the Manifestation of this coming Aeon in which we now live, and they regarded it with intense horror and fear, not understanding the precession of the Aeons, and regarding every change as catastrophe. This is the real interpretation of, and the reason for, the diatribes against the Beast and the Scarlet Woman in the XIII, XVII and XVIIIth chapters of the Apocalypse. Further study of this card may be made by close examination of Liber XV. --Atu XI. Lust, The Book of ThothAll I get is that the Apocalypse was the recension of a dozen or so totally disconnected allegories, that were pieced together, and ruthlessly planed down to make them into a connected account; and that recension was re-written and edited in the interests of Christianity, because people were complaining that Christianity could show no true spiritual knowledge, or any food for the best minds: nothing but miracles, which only deceived the most ignorant, and Theology, which only suited pedants. So a man got hold of this recension, and turned it Christian, and imitated the style of John. (Note: There is no question in my mind that this explanation is correct from the viewpoint of profane scholarship. “Angels” who off er absurd theories about material aff airs are false elementals who amuse themselves at the expense of the naïveté of the would-be-Magician.) And this explains why the end of the world does not happen every few years, as advertised. --ARN: 2nd Aethyr, The Vision and the VoiceIn addition, reviews appearing in The Equinox (I:6) lavished praise onThe Equinox (I:6) lavished praise onThe EquinoxTHE APOCALYPSE UNSEALED: Being an Esoteric Interpretation of THE INITIATION OF IOANNES, by James M.

Under the Seal of the K.E.W. Degree of M∴M∴M∴9Review by YarkerIt is possible to write upon this book in a freer manner, without off ence, than upon any other book in the Canon of Scripture, for there is no other book which has caused so much disquiet to theologians, in all ages, as has the “Revelation of St John the Divine,” and it is but in comparatively recent times that it has been generally accepted as Canonical, and this even by those who admit that they do not understand it; and to such as these the Apocalypse Unsealed will be a veritable “Revelation” indeed. Mr. James M. Pryse accepts it Apocalypse Unsealed will be a veritable “Revelation” indeed. Mr. James M. Pryse accepts it Apocalypse Unsealedunreservedly as the work of the Apostle John, but we ought to mention that there is a long string of authorities against this view. Dionysius, who was surnamed the Great, of Alexandria, was a pupil of Origen, and he of Clement of Alexandria, all catechists of the “Arcane Discipline” which taught a Christianised version of the older Gnosis, which Clement and others had brought into the Church from the older secret, or occult, societies of which they were, or had been members. This Dionysius makes a certain John the Presbyter, as of note in Asia Minor in the 1st century, and distinct from the Apostle, to be the author of the book. Presbyter Cajus, or Gaius, of Rome, and the Alogi, attributed it to Cerinthus, a Gnostic of the independent sect of these, and Eusebius quotes both Dionysius and these Alogi; Nicephorus Callistus uses the same as saying that some who had preceded them had manipulated the book in such way, in every chapter, that the original could not be recognised. This may be an exaggeration, but amongst the eminent critics who have denied the authenticity of the book may be mentioned these, and what else can we expect when none to the present time could understand it? Against it are De Wett, Bleek, Ewald, Credner, Schott, Lucke, Neander, Michaelis, who treat the style as utterly foreign to that of John the Apostle. The fi rst-named observes that “Revelation” is characterised by strong Hebraisms, ruggedness, and exhibits the absence of pure Greek words, whilst in the Gospel of John is to be found a calm, deep feeling, but in the Apocalypse we have great creative power of fancy; -- the two minds are at variance with each other. St Jerome had an exalted opinion of the book, and says that it has much of mystery therein; possibly he saw it with the same eyes as Mr Pryse. Even both Luther and Erasmus were doubtful as to its acceptance. The Encyclopaedia Britannica argues that its allusions are of the 4th or 5th century. It may be mentioned here, that Dom John Chapman, D.O.S., has made an examination of the question this year, and argues, with doubtful success, that John the Presbyter and John the Apostle were the same person, and accepts both the Gospel and the Apocalypse as the works of Apostle John, and accounts for the diff erence in style as that of the amanuensis whom the Apostle John employed.Two noticeable, but irreconcilable, attempts have in recent years been made to interpret the book, theologically and historically. The learned Dr. E. V. Kenealy made sense out of it, but overdid the subject. He believed it to represent the Apocalyptic church of Adam, and found in its addresses to the “Seven Churches” the existence of a great Asian hierarchy of the seven temples of the “twenty-four Ancients,” and further, in its various characters, the acts of the twelve divine incarnations, or messengers, who follow each other at periods of 600 years, as taught in regard to the manifestations of Vishnu.Then, in 1906, we have a book of the astronomer, Nicholas Marazoff , verified by the astronomers Ramin and Lanin, who attempt an astrological view, grounded on the state of the heavens at Patmos on the 30th September 395, at 5 o’clock at night. Jupiter -- the white horse -- was then in Sagittarius; whilst Saturn -- the pale horse -- was in Scorpio; the sun in Virgo, and the moon under her feet. John Chrysostom was then in Patmos, and immediately after 395 was called to Rome to become a presbyter; but Rome fi nding that the “Second Coming” did not take place, it is argued that he was deprived and banished as a “false prophet.” Against this we have the fact that Chrysostom does not mention the book, but the date assigned agrees with criticisms as the book now stands.We must defer to the superior knowledge of this modern “Unveiler,” though personally I am inclined to accept the views of those early Fathers who assign the authorship to Cerinthus, and also the later German critics, who believe that the fi rst three chapters and the last have been added by a later hand, and other portions altered to agree with the Scriptures held to be orthodox. Of course this, if it were so, does not eff ect in any way the views of Mr Pryse, but rather strengthens them, as I look upon the imagery of the book as essentially that of the earlier and pre-Christian Gnostics. Though we may not have absolute proof of the great"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Knight of the East & WestAntecedent Materials for Initiated StudyKnight of the East & West . Under the Seal of the K.E.W. Degree of M∴M∴M∴10antiquity of the Gnosis, such as Mr. Pryse unveils, yet it is clearly Aryan, dating from the time of Momu -- the thinker; then again the development of the Kundalini -- serpent fi re -- world’s mother, also termed rousing the Brahm -- is said to be shown as issuing from the foreheads of early Egyptian kings; Apollonius of Tyana, a contemporary of our Jesus, visited the Gymnosophists of the Upper Nile, but said that they were not equal to those of India. The British Druids must have had a knowledge of the “Serpent fi re” in their secret instruction, or why exclaim, “I am a serpent.” The Mythraic Mysteries, and all the Eranoi Societies, were equally protected by the laws of Solon seven centuries B.C., and Mr. Pryse observes that only once does the word Halleluiah occur in the Bible, yet we know that it formed the close of a chant in the “Rites of Purifi cation” in a call to the slain god for deliverance, in pre-Christian centuries, and further there are Mythraic traces in Revelation. We also know from a large mass of inscriptions found in recent times, that the early Christians made use of the very ancient societies, and by that course spread their doctrine. Before the issue of the “Unsealing,” the same translator published the “Magical Message of Ioannes,” a translation of great value which receives much additional light from the later work, and the more so as it supplies, in a knowledge of Hermetic Greek, much meaning which escapes us in the authorised version.In the “Unsealing,” Mr. Pryse goes solid for the book, the whole book, and nothing but the book, as the veritable work of the Apostle John, hence the clergy may extend a welcome hand to it. He quite believes it is a work of the Apostle John, and defends the style; amongst these there are some doubtless who are narrow-minded, but here, and still more prominently in America, there are broad-minded clergy who will welcome the Unsealing.The Freemasons too in their higher grades, which have more or less reached us through the Rosicrucians, have very strong allusions to the Apocalypse, and may profi t by it, and this refers to several systems practised throughout the world. Thus the Order of Heredom (Harodim) Rosy Cross, which has an unchanged Ritual from 1740, at least, draws upon Dionysius the Areopagite, a disciple of St Paul, and it has also a rhythmetical description of the New Jerusalem. Again, two entire degrees of the Scottish Rite of 33° are drawn from the Apocalypse, and certainly entered the Rite before 1758, and seem as if they were drawn bodily from the Rosicrucian Militia of the Cross: I allude to the 17° Knight of the East and West, and the 19° of Grand Pontiff , which treat upon the Heavenly Jerusalem, and the opening scene of the Revelations. It was rather a pity that when the late Albert Pike was revising the Rituals, he did not consolidate the Rite by changing the places of the 17° with the 20°, which latter treats of Zerubbabel. His predecessor Morin, in 1767, did a like thing by the Amalgamation of Prince Adept, which he had in his patent of 1762, with Knight of the Sun, and supplying the blank thus created with Patriarch Noachite. There is also the Royal Oriental Order of the Sat Bhai which was founded 1743-5 by a Brahmin Pundit at Prag, for certain Anglo-Indian offi cers, and which is now well established in America. The idea that Revelation is a book of Initiation is not altogether new to Freemasons, as the late Dr. Geo. Oliver elaborated that view at considerable length, but Mr. Pryse’s view is quite a diff erent sort of Initiation; it is the development of the semi-miraculous powers of the Gnosis of Clement, Origen, and the early Christian Church, the birth of the divine three principles, the Crestos, in the human soul. The key to this “Unsealing” is the text itself, in which is found the Nos. 333, 444, 666, 777, 888, 999, 1000, as applied to the seven principal chakras of the human body, as taught by Greek Yogis. Apart altogether from the possession of a reliable literal translation of the book, there are seventy-five pages upon the development of the Kundalini,and each subject is followed in the text by a commentary in application. Mr. Pryse expresses the view that the book is necessarily incomprehensible to the conventional theologian, yet easily comprehended by the esoteric Initiate, i.e. by him who possesses the Gnosis, and that the drama is perfect in all its parts. I may add that most of this class of Initiative books had a double interpretation, and hence that the same may be equally found in the Apocalypse, but into this Mr. Pryse does not enter."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Knight of the East & WestAntecedent Materials for Initiated StudyKnight of the East & West . Under the Seal of the K.E.W. Degree of M∴M∴M∴11Review by CrowleyMr. Pryse has undoubtedly found the key of the Apocalypse, and many of his interpretations are profound and accurate. But he is afflicted by sexual mania to an extent positively shocking, and does not understand the harmony of the principles. Adeptship is balanced growth, not lopping. A rose dies if you remove the root and stalk, Mr. Pryse!He is unfortunately a poor scholar, and has developed the American literary sense to an incredible point. He translates ακρασια, “impotence, lack of control,” as “sensuality,” αγγελος as “divinity,” and gives us “saucers” for “vials”!Unfortunately, too, he has studied Eastern Mysticism at second-hand, through Theosophical spectacles. Nor has he kept even to Blavatsky the genius, but relied upon her commentators, who had neither her learning nor her experience.But he has the key, and it opens the way for a real study of “St. John” by a person of greater ability.It is a very remarkable fact, however, that Akrasia (333) and Akolasia (333) should so accurately describe Choronzon (333). No higher test of the truth of “The Vision and the Voice” could be desired.Again, 666 is ‘Η Φρεν, not the Lower Mind, as Mr. Pryse unhellenically says, but Tiphereth, the Lion that lieth down with the Lamb. Nor, by the way, is Iacchos a phallic God except as ‘Ο Νικων himself is phallic, and has his mystic name written upon that organ, according to Mr. Pryse! Iacchus = IAO = Jehovah, and concentrates I.N.R.I.We recommend the book for its suggestion and insight; it is one of the best of the kind."}]
