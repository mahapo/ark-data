In the North-West, even more than Urdu, it is the lingua franca of the upper classes: it is the tongue spoken in the courts of the Believing Princes: it is the dialect alike of love and of literature: and its possession is a very talisman from Kabul to Yarkand. As a subaltern stationed at R...P..., though in a British regiment, I found it my first duty to acquire a thorough grounding in the tongue of Hafiz, for these as well as professional reasons. Thus I made the acquaintance of Munshi Mahbub Tantra, a Kashmiri from Bandipur, but one resident for nearly 30 years in Shiraz and Bushir. My knowledge of the writings of Richard Burton came in very handy, as also the vague studies of Oriental mysticism with which I had amused my leisure hours: so that a genuine friendship soon sprang up between pupil and teacher. After some months, indeed, - and this is how I find myself transformed into that glorious being, an Editor - the munshi, with the childlike frankness of the Kashmiri, blurted out: The Sahib is not like other sahibs; they begin by casting dirt at my people for their bad life, and end by spitting upon my beard, bidding me procure for them a fat and fair boy: but the Asylum of the World, who lives like a great prince and a fakir (meaning: \"You have illimitable resources, but are abstemious\") really understands the \"hikmat-i-Illahi\" and will not jest if I myself bring to him the treasure of Iran. What, I exclaimed, you mean to bring me a boy without asking? and dissolved in laughter. He stammered, with the shamed smile of the Oriental, that he had a sacred and secret book treating of the 'hikmat' but that it was never shown to anyone but a Sufi of great and exceptional sanctity - such as \"the Protector of the Poor, my father and mother, who glances at the earth in the hot season, and the fields are immediately tall and green\". Me. The MS., produced, bore on its front the legend Bagh-i-muattar, in all the glory of the finest Talik calligraphy. Why! I exclaimed, this is the Scented Garden! The famous Arab treatise of the Sheik al Nefzawi, which Burton rendered into English and his silly wife destroyed1. This is the Ars Amoris of the Bedawin! Mahbub (who had never heard of all this) observed that Allah knew everything, and the Sahib *nearly* everything. The upshot of it all was that I started to read the work as part of my daily task. But it was not until a second perusal that I grasped what had happened. Some pedantic idiot had arranged the Ghazals in alphabetical order, according to the rhymes!"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 A common practice in the diwan of the common poet! Here a lamentable and fatal error. For there is a psychological order in the Odes: arrange them properly, and a complete story -nay! A complete system of philosophy issued there from, as the living water from the rock at the touch of Moses' wand. When, after long labour, I had made a provisional arrangement, and shewed my great discovery to Mahbub with open triumph, he calmly observed that oh yes! The Ruler of the World was wiser than Solomon, and the proper order could be checked by noticing that that first letter of the first ode was Aleph, the second of the second Ba, the third of the third Jim, and so on! I take great credit to myself for the fact that with only six transpositions my provisional order became that of the poet.   "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 THE POEM Abdullah el Haji flourished in circa 16 A.D., well after the classic era of Persian poetry. But his style is highly praised by competent judges, though the older school regret the way in which he has broken away from tradition in: (a) The introduction of coarse expressions. (b) The undue exercise of poetic license: such as (1) His extension of the usual license re the genitive kasra to all kasra sounds. (2) His occasional breach of the rule which forbids two inert consonants to occur together, though a friendly commentator ingeniously asserts that he does this only to add to the grimness of verses describing anger, punishment, terror, death, or some unpleasant idea: (3) His treatment of the Tarjiband: and (4) His trick of inventing words to carry out some extravagant metaphor or paranomasia: (c) His novel symbolism, which they deplore as likely to confuse even the most pious: (d) Per contra, his novel symbolism as likely to be understood of even the least instructed: and (e) His constant gibes at Sadi. (I must admit that I was quite unable to see the point of any single one of these, though Mahbub took a deal of pains to shew me. They appear to depend on subtle points of grammar and phraseology.) It would be impertinent and useless for me to enumerate the various metres in which these Ghazals are written; but concerning the Ghazal itself, the remarks of Dr. Forbes ('Persian Grammar', p. 144, par. 148.) are so luminous and concise that I cannot refrain from giving my readers the pleasure of their perusal. \"This kind of composition corresponds, upon the whole, with the Ode of the Greeks and Romans, or the Sonetta of the Italians. The most common subjects of which it treats are, the beauty of a mistress, and the sufferings of the despairing lover from her absence or indifference. Frequently it treats of other matters, such as the delights of the season of Spring, the beauties of the flowers of the garden, and the tuneful notes of the nightingales as they warble their melodies among the rose bushes; the joys resulting from wine and hilarity, are most particularly noticed at the same time; the whole interspersed with an occasional pithy allusion to the brevity of human life, and the vanity of sublunary matters in general. The more orthodox among the Musulman are rather scandalized at the eulogies bestowed upon the 'juice of the grape' by their best poets, such as Hafiz for example; and they endeavour to make out that the text is to be taken in a mystic or spiritual sense, such as we apply to the 'Song of Solomon'."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 It appears to me, however, that Hafiz writes upon his favourite theme just as naturally, and with as much gusto, as either Anacreon or Horace, who in this respect may be safely acquitted of the sins of mysticism. The first couplet of the Ghazal is called the Matla`, or 'the place of rising' (of a heavenly body), which we may translate the 'Opening'. It is a standard rule that both hemistichs of this couplet should have the same metre and rhyme. The remaining couplets must have the same metre, and the second hemistich of each (but not necessarily the first) must rhyme with the Matla. The concluding couplet is called the Matka`, or \"place of cutting short:\" which we may translate the 'Close'; hence the phrase, 'Az matla` ta makta', 'from beginning to end'. In the Makta', or close, the poet manages to introduce his own name, or rather his assumed or poetic name, called the Takhallus, though few of the older poets paid strict attention to this rule previous to the time of Hakim Sanayi, between A.D. 1150 and 1180. Anwari occasionally introduces his own name in his Ghazals, but it is the exception and not the rule in his case. As a general law, the Ghazal must consist of at least five couplets, and not more than fifteen; but on this subject authors by no means agree, either with one another or with real facts. Hafiz, for example, has several Ghazals consisting of sixteen and even seventeen, couplets; Hakim Sanayi has many that exceed the latter number.\" "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 THE MSS. Being myself admitted formally (in the course of my first few readings) to the joyous company of the Sufis, (I cannot here discuss the curiously patriarchal systems of mystic fraternity in vogue among Muslims, if only because I am a Freemason). I was enabled to use several fine MSS. for the translation, a privilege of which I availed myself without scruple or diffidence: without scruple, as knowing I was well entitled to them: and without diffidence, because of the invariable courtesy which adepts in these mysteries exhibit to their fellow workers in the divine Arcanum. I also was permitted to order a copy to be made, which the calligraphist has still in hand. It is the sort of order that acquits a man of the charge of doing nothing for posterity, for assuredly nobody who knows India will try to raise false hopes in me that I may live long enough to see it. I would warn scholars that, unless they are in some way definitely mystics and truly acknowledged as such, they will do better to hunt for the lost books of Livy than for the Bagh-i-muattar. There is no copy in any public library here or in the East: not surprising, when one hears Platt in 1874 complain that of so famous a classic as the Gulistan there is no genuine Persian MS., but only the garbled Indian copies, in either the India Office Library or the British Museum. If you question a Persian on the subject, he will \"begin to curse and to swear\", saying: \"I know not the\" book. Of late I have amused myself by asking stray Persians \"Have you ever heard of Abdullah el Haji?\" and when they denied all knowledge of him quoting: \"Forget, an if thou wilt, the scribe! The lovely script to heart by laid!\" The reason is of course that it is held exquisitely sacred: and seeing that the nature of the symbolism renders it open to the prurient jest or prudish reproach of the notoriously foul-minded Anglo-Saxon, the Persian, who is nothing if not dignified, is justly chary of casting his pearls before swine. Indeed, a certain scent-seller with whom I once argued against all this secrecy replied by begging my permission to depart, \"for a Jew had promised to spit on his beard before as sohri (noon prayer), and he feared to miss the appointment\". But for all that, no well-appointed private library but has one or more copies of the little masterpiece: no travelling merchant but carries at least some leaves of it under his dirty sheepskin. It is too sacred even to sell, whatever the extremity: the one copy - a mutilated and incorrect Indian - which by dint of infinite diplomacy I half cajoled, half forced from a drunken Afghan elephant-snarer in Ceylon, where I was shooting on leave, became the prey of the ants which help to make that devil-haunted Eden a House of Little Ease."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 As, seriously, I expect to get my copy within twelve months or so (a brother officer, now at Q..., where the copyist lives, has promised me to stretch out - unofficially - the iron hand of the Sirkar on my behalf) I may say that I intend to issue the MS. in facsimile, as a pendant to the present volume. For, when all is said and done, I do not believe in either the advisability or the efficacy of this secrecy business. The Apocalypse has been published for some years now, and I have yet to meet anyone who really knows how to extract the gold. Certainly no unworthy person. All arcana are indicible. A man whose formula is n may understand (n + 1), but not (n + 101). So that my Persian MS. is doubly safe from the profaning touch of the British Public. Even the Persians themselves hold that there are Guardians who know how to guard: without pandering to any such superstitious beliefs, I may say that as far as results go, I believe them to be right. I should observe that the translation itself, as well as many of the notes, is due in the very greatest degree to the earnest help of my munshi, and of a certain dealer in furs, with whom I travelled through L...h, A...r, and G...t, as well as in the C...s country, during two successive summers. Some two months after the completion of translation, I fell with the gentleman whose name appears with mine on the title-page. He represented to me that a large class of scholars might be reached by considerable extension of the notes to cover ethnographical, critical, and other interesting points. We went to work accordingly during my last leave in England, and accomplished (I think) a good deal.A The verse rendering are in every case later paraphrases from the original drafts, and the prose has been carefully revised at leisure. I wished to put the whole into verse: but the 'prodigious difficulties of the monorhyme', as Burton only too inadequately says, beat me as often as not. Had I been able to obtain the aid of a professional poet, I might have made a better job of it, for my experience is confined to vers de societe! But I have done my best. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 THE SUFI DOCTRINES No apology is needed, since the publication of Sir William Jones's able monograph, for the gross symbolism of such Oriental poems as those of Hafiz, the Song of Songs, the Ghazals of 'Ismat of Bokhara' - not to mention the obscene Chinese Aphorisms of Kwaw. Yet no doubt though Hafiz sings chiefly of wine, Solomon of Woman, and 'Ismat of harloty, we sooner pardon these freedoms because we ourselves can understand, though we can never approve of them: but they seem innocent indeed when we compare them with the nameless bestialities of Kwaw, or the frank pederasty of Abdullah. But, apart from the fact that pederasty: fornication: 'St-George': 'matrimonial' in Persia and England respectively, we may at least suspend judgment while we consider this symbolism in detail with a view to discovering why (unless from caprice) el Haji chose this particular indulgence to mirror that supreme passion of the human heart, the craving for unity with the All-One. \"Make room for me\" quoth the poet of Salaman and Absal, \"on that divan which is only large enough for one!\" Now I shall waste my rime if I prove that something in the nature of sexual intercourse is the most fitting image of that passion; for our Christian theologian, anxious to avoid the reproach of the scoffer who quotes such passages as \"Me beloved put in his hand by the hole, and my bowels were moved in me\" (Cant. v.4), have built a great rampart of argument to that effect2. But Abdullah no doubt considered that the specific differences between man and woman vitiated the symbol, since man is formed in the image of God, and in Muslim theology is not supposed to have forfeited the same. It may here be remarked (as a bulwark to this contention) that el Haji is conspicuous -in fact, incurs reproach in consequence - for his innovation in the matter of scientific precision. Hafiz uses his symbols vaguely: the tresses of his mistress are no doubt the Glories of God, but they are also at times the rays of the sun, the verses of the Q'uran, and so on; wherefore an uninstructed pupil, or an inquisitive Sahib, or an unauthorised Sufi, one of those who 'creep, and intrude, and climb into the fold', cannot, by possession of the elementary keys, unlock the Holy of Holies of the 'hikmat-i-Illahi'. It is as a violator of the Magian secrecy, even more than as a Christianizer, that Abdullah is blamed. Mildly blamed, for none would dare express downright disapproval of so exalted an adept; but it is no doubt for this reason that the Bagh-i-muattar is only allowed to circulate in private, even among Persians themselves; bestowed rather upon the already accomplished mystic than upon the mere inquirer into the 'hikmat', and denied existence to the question of the infidel. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 Perhaps owing to some curious trick of my brain, I found myself (one fine day) in the state which, as far as I can gather, Hindu writers call Samadhi. (Compare the experiences of Burton in the Bombay Presidency, as hinted by Lady Sisted in her admirable sketch of his Life.) Hindus claim that advanced Yogis can always recognize at sight those who have attained this condition, just as the Freemasonry of Pederasts makes the formality of introduction superfluous among free companions of the Craft. I must say that I attribute nine tenths of Burton's success with natives of Arabia, Africa, and Hindostan to his mastery of their mystic systems, not only as a theoretician, valuable as that is, but as a craftsman. In my own case I am convinced that Mahbub would never have entrusted me with his precious MS. but for the fact that he recognized me as one of the 'illuminati'. Such a secret as that of Samadhi is absolutely safe, because one knows it cannot by any possibility divulge the same. It is a real, not an artificial secret. One could expose Freemasonry -it has been done repeatedly by idiots who did not understand what it meant- by publishing the rituals and so on. But the secret remains and ever must remain the property of those worthy of it; nor does it necessarily follow that that highest living mason has a knowledge thereof. But the clothing of the secret, so to speak, can be studied; and for those whom the glorious garment may fit such study is truly illuminating. This being understood, it may be granted without further discussion that the intelligent study of the Bagh-i-muattar will yield deeper knowledge -the husks for the scholar, the wheat for the elect- than any other known poem. Now the revealing of one is the revealing of all: for from Fez to Nikko, there is one mysticism and not two. The fanatic followers of el Senussi can suck the pious honey from the obscene Aphorisms of Kwaw, and the twelve Buddhist sects of Japan would perfectly understand the inarticulate yells of the fire-eaters of el Maghraby. Not that there is or has ever been a common religious tradition; but for the very much simpler reason that all the traditions are based on the same set of facts. Just as the festivals of Spring all the world round more or less suggest the story of the Crucifixion and Resurrection, simply because the actual phenomena which every man is bound to observe in Nature are essentially the same in every clime: so also is Mysticism One, because the physiological constitution of mankind is practically identical the wide world over. We have then the right to buy our pigs in the cheapest market, and the Bagh-I-muattar will certainly give us more reward for our trouble than any other work, the only possible competitors being the Bhagavad-gita, Bhagavad Purana3, and the Chinese Aphorisms of Kwaw. El Haji then earns our gratitude in that he has adopted the principle 'One mystic grace one symbol'; and if he have but the wit to interpret this simple cipher, the whole secret of the East is open to our eyes. In the notes (which I have by no means stinted) I have indicated clearly to what each allusion refers; and it is within the capacity of any reader of ordinary intelligence to erect a complete system of philosophy, practical and transcendental, on these sound if slender foundations. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 True, Abdullah approaches Calvin (too closely to please most students of Eastern religion) by his insistence on the doctrines of Sin and Grace, Freewill and Discipline; but on the other hand, neither St. Francis nor Buddhaghosha can parallel his Devotion and his Phenomenalism. No doubt at times one is puzzled for a while: one picks up a loose word here and there: one doubts: one guesses: one is illumined in a moment. One is rather reminded of the working of a heliograph under unfavourable conditions. But (as with that instrument) by dint of repetition one gets the all-important message at last: and the situation is saved. It is undoubtedly the importance which he attaches to Sin, Repentance, Penance, Grace, as the means of raising the old to the new Adam that cost el Haji so much pains in persecution by the more orthodox Muslim: possibly the teaching of St. Paul had vaguely penetrated to the gulf with the merchant of Venice or Portugal, and their danger had been recognized by those who held to the simple grandeur of Islam. But clearly the belief in Evil -perhaps even a modified Manichaeism4; we must not forget that this heresy is a legacy from the Guebres with their Aormuzd and Ahriman -had impressed itself profoundly on the mind of the young Abdullah. Or he may have attached an exaggerated importance to that mystic phenomenon which Bulwer Lytton calls the 'Dweller of the Threshold', that moment of intensest agony which separates Work from Reward, and serves as a sure diagnostic5 to discriminate between the happy-go-lucky \"union with God\" of the mere church-goer -an emotional glow of pious exhilaration- and the splendid and illuminating Union which constitutes Samadhi. Never forget that this great doctrine informs almost the whole of so-called Christian literature; St. Paul's apostrophe (I Thess. iv. 16) if translated literally into Sanskrit, word by word, reads like a mutilated but unmistakable passage from some lost Upanishad. Such follies as Sri Parananda's lunatic commentaries on Matthew and John could never have been perpetrated but for the fact that after all his fundamental theory - that Christ was a Yogi - is correct. And our hymn: For ever with the Lord! Amen! so let it be! Life from the dead is in that word: 'Tis immortality. may be rendered by paraphrase: For ever Timeless: an epithet only  used of the Atman. with the Lord sam Adhi. Amen  Aum."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 Life from the dead an expression constantly  and exclusively employed  to denote the yogic attainment. that word to Aum is attributed the great  power of regeneration. It has  the sense of the Greek Logos. immortality a-mrita, the same idea glyphed  as a dew: the Christian Graal,  cup, blood, etc. In short, every single word in the verse is literally and even in two cases etymologically identical with a technical mystic Sanskrit phrase. This is not a carefully chosen and exceptional case: on the contrary, I challenge any orthodox divine to produce any passage of scripture or any decent hymn which is free from identities of this kind. To return to the question on phallicism, I will not be so frivolous as to quote 'New every morning is the love: Our waking and uprising prove' as an example of obscene symbolism in the Christian Church; for there is no lack of serious identity. The cross itself is notoriously the lingam: the vesica piscis - Christ being [Greek] Ichthys the fish -the Yoni. Now the vesica piscis is the foundation of all Christian architecture: that is to say, the female member lying open, and awaiting impregnation by the male, is the glyph of the church, and the divine invocations upon its altar. Similarly the figure of the bride of Christ has only been spiritualized in very recent days. Whoso doubts it may consult Payne Knight's essays 'On the Worship of Priapus'. The lady was usually represented by the 'Early Christians' (our models in all things) as a naked female with a lascivious grin; offering with her hands, apparently to the first comer, a vulva which is of the shape and relative size of a horse-collar! Any ordinary man who attempted to indulge her fancy would find himself in the position of Baker's blue-jay. But with God all things are possible. I am tempted to add that even plain pederasty, without any question of symbol at all, is perhaps not so incompatible with the virtues, religious, social, moral, and domestic, as by good compatriots make such a point of asserting with a fine show of disgust and indignation, thereby lending colour to the fixed idea which obtains on the Continent of Europe that all Englishmen are sodomites. To my hand, as I write this, comes a strange essay [Greek] 'Peri tas Paiderasteias' written by a well-known clergyman. He is adored by his wife and children; his church is full when his brethren in the district are in despair; his poor are better looked after than any for fifty miles around; and his choir is incomparable the best in the kingdomB. To a sincere and even rapturous piety he joins a passionate love for the pleasures of the table and the bed: and the reader will I think grant him both acuteness of intellect and elegance of diction."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 It is instructive: indeed, beyond all comparison better than the laborious and pedantic exposition I had conceived it my duty to attempt: it gives the inside view, and references to the scholars and pederasts who have previously enlarged on this fascinating topic: the style is impassioned and the matter impeccable.

CAREY It is sunset, and the rose rays fall aslant the woodland; they trace patterns of wondrous witchery on the velvet of the glade. A ruddy glow lightens the marble leer of the all-glorious one, the child of Arcady, the ineffable Pan -Pan! Pan! Io Pan!- before whom I lie prostrate with my robes careless and free-flung, so that the red warmth of Apollo burns on my live quivering flesh, as I lie and yearn in utter worship towards the all-glorious one, not daring to raise my eyes to yonder rosy shaft of Pariah stone. The love in my heart melts all the winter of my body, and the warm salt spring gush from my eyes upon the ground -Surely the latter spring shall see green violets grow thereon! Then, in the hush of the sunset, come noiseless hoofs treading the enamelled turf; and ere I know it a fierce lithe hairy body has gripped mine, and the dread wand of magic shudders it live way into my being, so that the foundations of my soul are shaken. The heavy breath and the rank kisses of a faun are on my neck, and his teeth fasten in my flesh -a terrible heave flings our bodies into mid-air with the athletic passion that unites us with the utmost God- \"hid 'i th' middle o' matter\" -and the life of my strange lover boils within by bowels- there is a ronronnement as of myriad nymphs and fauns, satyrs and dryads, -a stirring of the waters of life- we fall back in an ecstasy -somewhat like death- with the gasping murmur Pan! Pan! Io Pan! While the marmoreal splendour before us turns with the last ray of sunlight his goodly smile upon our still and stricken bodies - the heap of the slain of Priapus -perinde ac cadaver- ah! It is night, it is death. Alas! It is not sunset; here is no glade, but a noisy London square; we cannot live, we must talk; we cannot love, we must dissect. We know that these people are not the gracious children of God, but the evil and laborious gnomes of hell; creatures whose lives are given to the senseless lust of gold, the infamous toil of coynte, counter and counting house. They understand us only enough to know that we are happy; therefore they hate us; therefore as they spat on Christ, forsaken of all but John, his sweet-voiced catamite, so does the cur to-day spit in the face of Oscar Wilde, as he goes from the judge to the prison. Ye were too childlike, too innocent, too hopeful of mankind, that ye did proclaim your pearly gospel to the swinish multitude! The old law, silence, is the master: therefore whoso looketh for my name, let him find it darkling in these lines of power! R. is the Father, W. the Son, And E. the Holy Spirit, three and one: But if they esoterically are read My equal name shall glitter out instead. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17 Yes! we must not sing hymns to Pan to-day: we must pretend to be German professors, with a keen scientific interest in these very remarkable phenomena which look so much like madness, and which our own perfect sanity and the effulgence (possibly a shade alto) of our discreet and legal passion for our Limburger-tainted hausfrau hide from our fuller comprehension. As is right, therefore: In nomine v. Krafft-Ebing, v. Schrenk-Notzing, et Havelock Ellis, Amen. The Holy Trinity (invoked above) have brought within the knowledge of the English-speaking races all those facts connected with 'sexual perversion' (in its infinite variety) which occur in the diseased. The late Sir Richard Burton has informed us of all that need be known on the subject in the matter of its historical, geographical, ethnographical distribution: and his Priapeia, and the verses of the and Hermaphrodite of Panormita, form a valuable commentary on his remarks. Ulrichs and Symonds have treated the subject sympathetically (though rather timidly and as it were with the cold ardour of the special pleader) in its modern practical aspects: but with the exception of Verlaine in 'Hombres', Wilde in 'Teleny', the pseudonymous (as we suspect) author of 'White Stains', and the nameless Aristophanes who wrote the 'Nameless Novel', nobody in modern times has dared to voice openly the supreme sanity, the splendid athleticism, and the unutterable spirituality of the male rapture of the passion between man and man. In treating of this matter I must first premise that by pederasty I mean actual sodomy as defined by British law -immissio penis in6 corpus vivum. Arse makes life golden, want of it dull yellow; The rest is only leather and prunella. At least, the rest is but preliminaries. An acute observer of my acquaintance remarked to me recently that it was the actual mess caused by emission, and the necessity of cleaning it up, that, by allowing time for passion to cool, prevented a great deal of copulation which would otherwise take place. There is a great gulf fixed between the 'short time' and the 'all night', and that great gulf is filled with Condy's Fluid! This applies equally to Sodomy. If the semen is safely bestowed in mouth or anus of the beloved one, the temptation is to begin all over again; bar the trifle of fatigue, one is in the same position as at first; its loss between the legs or in the hand rouses a sentiment of disgust7 which is fatal to passion. Even the mouth, like the vagina, remains in a somewhat greasy condition after it has achieved the holy task, and we have no hesitation in plumping the anus as the one vase into which the perfumed oil of manhood may be poured without exciting a reaction8. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18 This point being established, let me furtherE make a distinction between the two great classes of sodomites. Ulrichs has pedantically christened them Urning and Uranodioning: for the former we have no colloquial name: the latter we term Bimetallist9. Being himself an Urning, he has naturally failed to grasp the vast gap that divides the classes, which is that between an indulgence and a morbid craving: between the insane delusion that one is Jesus Christ or Julius Caesar and the sane and healthy resolve to emulate the exploits of these worthies in mysticism and war respectively. We pity the Urning, as we pity the consumptive or the drunkard; but we do not pity him in any special sense, any more than a connoisseur of fine wines pities the drunkard above all other pitiable folk. We do not acknowledge any nervous weakness as having a peculiar claim on us, just because it lies in the same plane10 as one of our hobbies. Now this question of Bimetallism leads us to the subject of the reasons for our indulgence, since we are not (as some silly Germans would pretend) equally with the Urning the slaves of an uncontrollable paranoia, to use a somewhat discredited but useful term. Why, in short, (quoth Mr. Moses Monometallist) loving women as you do, sir, do you go to boys and men? Is it only for variety? If not, in what does the charm consist? I will enumerate the conditions, and that cheerfully, since it will incidentally enable me to justify that very remarkable phrase used above, the spirituality of Sodomy. A woman can afford two pleasures to a man, which a boy cannot: namely: (1) the pleasure of the cunnilinge. (2) common copulation. (both these either with or without 'Red and white roses' i.e., menses and leucorrhoea.) Common to either sex (besides opifex and artifex) are obviously all forms of masturbation with the hand, mouth, breast, armpit, etc: active sodomy: most forms of sadism and masochism; nearly all forms of coprophilia: and so on. (These latter forms are so symbolic that sense of sex is a minor matter.) A man can afford to a man two pleasures which a woman cannot give him; namely: (1) passive sodomy. (pleasure of the pathic) (2) irrumation. (pleasure of the fellator)11 "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 The latter is a small matter, and we are justified in concluding that as far as gross gratifications go, the advantage, substantial though slight, rests with the woman. The supreme pleasures are common to both, except cunnilingism (especially during the monthly courses) on the one side, and passive sodomy on the other. Both are pleasures of a somewhat masochistic order, and if we had definitely to choose, it would be hard. Glory to the Creator whose bounty has not forced us to this alternative; aye! blessed for ever be His holy name, and thanksgiving in the highest for His loving-kindness towards the Children of Men! Why then do we so dearly cherish the passion of man and man, since of the liberty, do we pursue the shy kisses of silly English boys, often of the lower classes12, when every type of woman (from the moustachioed and muscular belly-dancer from Spain, with a constrictor cunni developed till the penis issues aching and bruised from her dangerous defile, to the soft and rosy maiden of our own dear land, with slender limbs and velvet flesh, whose pleasance is like a single slim petal of hyacinth) is at our disposal for sums ranging from half-a-crown to fifty guineas? To ask the question is to acknowledge that one is still no better than the brutes; and to answer it is (consequently) to attempt to teach a dog dog-Latin! O man! How can I hold talk with thee, who hast not lain upon a bed, expectant, fearful, of thou knowst not what; tremulous; stammering foolish words in pretence of conversation; thine eyes hard shut lest thou shouldst see thy lover move and perhaps (oh, worst of woes!), frighten him from thee; fearful, oh! Infinitely fearful lest he should not love thee after all, soft words (oh, the burning cheeks, the bitten lips!) whose hidden fire shall kindle the great blaze? How talk with thee, whose quickened hearing has not known him creep ever closer, yet afraid to touch thee, has not heard the rushing of his heart, the shortening of his breath? How talk, if thou have not felt one trembling foot seed thine, one hand steal near thee and yet nearer? Till thou feel the tremor of his body; till his hot breath stir thine hair! Why, neither thou nor I can tell of that swift attack (is it a minute or an hour?) when without word spoken the bonds of convention snap - hast thou seen a village, with its smug Swiss thieves, whelmed by the avalanche, the avalanche of elemental force, the avalanche of God? Nay, I remember nothing; I know I found myself naked in his naked arms, his giant member still throbbing and beating in my flooded bowels, and the world was aswim before mine eyes. I tell thee, man, that the first kiss of man to man is more than the most elaborately manipulated orgasm that the most accomplished and most passionate courtesan can devise. That is, it is not a physical13, but a spiritual pleasure. I tell thee, as I walk the sun-smitten streets of Mandalay, where lives a boy I love, that the very foundation of the soul tremble as mine eyes fall upon him. I have never spoken to him; I doubt if I could command myself to speak to him. Have I faced death in a hundred forms, and never winced, to fear (at last)14 the frown of a Nubian slave?

Do you remember the day of the storm, when we huddled under the rocks, and lit a fire of bracken and pine twigs?

He will know that the old poet was right who wrote: The passion of man for woman May serve a lad for a span. But utterly superhuman Is the passion of man for man. Let him but taste the wine! It grips him body and soul. Once and for all, Whatever befall, He is bound to the golden goal By the joy of his shuddering spine. He will know that in the rites of sodomy duly done, even more than in the rites of heterosexual passion, lies the great secret of the Universe, the Key of the Gardens of God... But I must not proselytize: many are called, but few chosen; a sodomite is born, not made; you can't make a silk sodomite out of an English grocer's boy; one sodomite doesn't make a scandal; take care of the boys, and the girls will take care of themselves; strike while the tool is hot; don't bugger in haste, or withdraw at leisure; a turd in the hand is worth two in the bush; a prick in time saves nine; it's a wise Wilde that knows his own Q.; one good turn deserves another; frig wise and fuck foolish; there's better boys in the choir than ever came out of it -all of which goes to show that it took no genius to write 'John Ploughman'. Not that if Charles Spurgeon had been one of us, his style16 would have approximated to that of Walter Pater; a stylist is as direct a miracle of God as a sodomite. No! I must not proselytise! there are enough of us in the world; a select body of idealists, of men cleansed from the gross passions, of poets and mystics linked in a perfect freemasonry of style and manner, of ships (as it were) who have dropped anchor in a safe harbour, or conquerors at ease in the towns they have captured, whose inhabitants are too crass and stupid even to know themselves slaves. Yes, we are a goodly company, the blest; our lives are spent in sunny gardens and yours in subterranean sewers; we are so blissful that we rarely notice you; when we do, it is to say: God have mercy upon these blind and miserable slaves, and bring them out into His light and joy and liberty!

Thou didst put on thy old provoking coquetry; though for many days thou hadst drunk nothing but water, thou didst comport thyself as one in whom the wine first blusheth100. Also when my love revived for thee a little, thou didst not immodestly thrust out thy buttocks, and show bare a gaping and hungry podex. On the contrary, thou wast like a young girl, and there was much shame when thy hand led the camel to the well101. Also there was embarrassment for thee when I bade thee act as thou didst act with thy Nubian; since if thou didst too well, I should reproach thee with wantonness; but if ill, with coldness.

It is indeed the fact, O gazelle-eyed boy, that thy podex is excessively wide; but my member can fill it, pressing in to its length till the sun and moon are at rest upon the snow-hills. This (thou wilt remember) was not the case before thou didst forsake me.

And there is no degree in the excellence of thy podex; nor is the joy of thy lover, when he delights therein, from day to day diminished or increased. This is the sigillum of perfection in any work. The perfect lover is calm and equable; storms of thunder, quakings of the earth, losses of goods, punishment from great men, none of these things cause him to rise from his divan, or to remove the silken tube of the rose-perfumed huqqa from his mouth.

For he said that in a certain holy meditation both Allah and himself were destroyed, and that nought remained, but only the consciousness of bliss154.

Nevertheless, these experiments which I have performed upon thy podex, solely with a view to investigating these statements155, make for a similar conclusion.

The Mirage Thou art perfect, Habib, in love; for yesterday when as a test of thy virtue I had thee beaten by the eunuchs, there was no cry of pain. Entirely lost in our love, thy knowledge was only of my member, and not of the blows; nor could any application of the staves, however vigorous, take away from thee that delight thou hast in me.

"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"I TRANSLATOR'S NOTES (\"Alain Lutiy\") 1. The two books have nothing in common, but the name Garden is the almost universal glyph for a book of mystic lore, and Perfume for divine chrism. The Arab book is a treatise on the various methods of copulation, plus some obscene stories, and a collection of prescriptions against impotence, pregnancy, and the like. 2. St. Augustine can find no better symbols than El Haji to express his love for God. \"What is it then, that I love, O my God, when I love you? It is not beauty of bodies, nor the glory which passes, nor the light which our eyes love; it is not the varied harmony of sweet songs nor the aroma of perfumes and sweet flowers, nor the voluptuous joys of carnal embraces. No, it is more than these that I love when I love my God; and yet in this love I find light, an inner voice, a perfume, a savour, an embrace of kind which does not leaves the inmost of myself. There in the depths of the soul glows something which is not in space: there a word is heard which has no syllables: thence there breathes a perfume which no breezes waft away: there food is always savoured and never eaten: there are embraces which never ask to end...\" 3. The few who still suppose that Omar Khayyam was a libertine should read the exposition of Book XI of this Purana. 4. Manes (Mani) the heresiarch was of course a Persian. 5. I cannot agree that such a moment necessarily intervenes between normal and Samadhic consciousness, or, as the Buddhists assert, that there is a long series on intervening states invariable and well-defined, though perhaps this may sometimes be so. Nor is the appearance of the \"Dweller\" a sure earnest of success: on the contrary, many (even most) will fail to pass this terrible barrier. 6. There is of course not the most shadowy reason in ethics for the attitude of the law. The most confirmed sodomite (bimetallist) may beget quite as many children as another, while monogamy is the fashion. If man were expected to fertilize some dozens of women every night, like a stud ram, I don't say: but he is not. But on the positive side, a strict adherence to sodomy, except for the practical purpose of begetting children, or for pacifying women, an object which a parallel development of Sapphism would more rationally fulfil, would avoid the numberless crimes and calamities inseparable from sexual intercourse - venereal diseases (almost entirely), seduction, abortion, concealment of birth, child-murder, social tyranny, - et omnis horrida cohors malorum. As few people seem to know the fons et origo legis, I may here be permitted to sketch it in outline. When the power of the Crescent menaced that of the Cross, sodomy was put down with Draconic rigour because the Turks believed that the Messiah (a reincarnation of Jesus) would be born of the love between two men. Sodomy was thus a religious duty with the Turk: at any moment his passion might be used to bring about the Millennium: so with the Christian it became heresy, and was punished as such. People who were beyond suspicion, such as Princes of the Church, could always obtain dispensations, and in fact habitually did so. The documents are extant. This was to the mediaeval mind a far more urgent matter than any mere persistence of Levitical tradition, founded as it was on a popular superstition scarcely less gross than their own. "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"II But to-day no man can bring forward either the population nonsense or the heresy nonsense, so he brings up his dinner instead, under the equally absurd delusion that the process is physically dirty. In the interests of Light and Truth, one cannot too widely disseminate the grossly phrased, but noble, American proverb that \"A turd jumps away from a live prick like a grasshopper from a snake\". Anyway, one can wash!D The sole effect of the law as it stands is to make life in England insupportable for the wretched Urning, and to expose every man, whether he be a sodomite or not to the attacks of blackmailers of the vilest sort. Suppose I am threatened by these gentry; suppose I catch them and prosecute them; suppose they get the maximum penalty, and I leave the court with applause and the strongly expressed thanks of the judge for the courage and skill with which I have discharged so unpleasant, albeit so useful, a public duty. Very well; does that convince my jealous wife? Does that prevent people in the street pointing me out as the man who was mixed up in that buggery business, don't you remember? Of course there was nothing against him: it's difficult to bring home these things, don't you know? But we think what we think, don't you know? While your admiring friends openly boast of you as a dam clever bugger, by God! He had half the boys in London, and when they started to blackmail him, he turned right round like that (gesture) before you could say \"knife\", by God! And didn't they get beans, by God! But could I fight an English election? How would my chiefs in the army look at it, when it came to the actual point of choosing one of two men for promotion? What price that fat tutorship? There are dozens of weak innocent fools in London at this hour who, making these reflections, paid the first fatal moderate demand. There are dozens of strong-minded men who have come to the conclusion that they may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb, especially as the former is real, and the latter imaginary, and so a posteriori turned their thoughts ad posteriorem. Some men are born sodomites, some achieve sodomy, and some have sodomy thrust upon them: the Urning, the Bimetallist, and the carcerophobe. There are some sodomites which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some sodomites, which were made sodomites of men: and there are sodomites, which have made themselves sodomites for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake. (The Urning, the Bimetallist and the carcerophobe, and the holy sodomite to whom his passion is a sacrament, leading him on the straight road into the very arms of God). He that is able to receive it, let him receive it! The law manufactures sodomites as it manufactures habitual criminals. Legalize sodomy, and you will diminish it; or even if, as you seem to fear, you increase it, you will see no change in society but an advance in refinement, and possibly, parallel with the fall in the price of Mercury, Iodine, and Sandalwood oil, a slight increase in the demand for that preparation of the supra-renal capsules which is so useful in obstinate cases of internal haemorrhoids. 7. Pray analyse the sensation aroused in you by the story which ends: (Mrs. Awkins, asleep, being awakened by the cup of tea which she has spilt over her lap). \"There you are, Awkings! All over my stummick again!\" 8. A skilful sodomite should be able to withdraw his penis nearly dry. The subsequent moisture of the anus will act as a pleasing lubricant, when the next round of preliminaries is over. 9. I would suggest allopath, homoeopath, and eclectic as a fitting classification of humanity. "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"III 10. A little obscure. I suppose the author means: a scientific whist player need not pity a gambler more than he does a drunkard; a father of twelve pity the raper more than the brawler; or the polo enthusiast pity the man who thinks he is a horse more than him who fancies himself a tea-pot.F 11. Conversely, it is interesting to observe that a woman can afford two pleasures to a woman, (1) tribadism (cunnus and cunnum).  (2) cunnilingism. A man can afford three pleasures to a woman, exclusively:  (1) sodomy. (2) irrumation (pleasure of the fellatrix).  (3) copulation. Of these tribadism is rather artificial, and hardly to be distinguished from ordinary masturbation: so that the balance is strongly in favour of man. This explains why very few women are exclusively Sapphists, but many bimetallists; and enables one to comprehend the hatred of woman for sodomy, and the toleration with which men regard Sapphism. 12. I cannot too strongly urge my readers to select their lovers from their equals in rank and fortune. It is the only safeguard against betrayal; further, it fulfills the Greek ideal, and silences the voice of adverse criticism.G 13. Besides all this, there is the question of \"nature\" and \"against nature\". Praise Lacedaemon, and despise Corinth! God gave me Daphne; I won Hyacinth. All our modern devices, though applications of nature, are against and above nature; therefore of God. Nature’s man is the cave-man. We take no paternal pride in the pariah dog, the product of Nature; in the highly bred setter, the product of man's genius applied to nature's very raw material, through centuries and chiliads of struggle, we do. There is no poetry in the panting Puritan prone on his puffing and perspiring Priscilla: the love of Adrian and Antinous is a monument for all ages. Is there better poetry in the world than Wilde's \"...on Adrian's gilded barge The laughter of Antinous\" or F....'s\" the splendid Syrian youth with scarlet mouth Standing upon the summit of the world?\" Why, to kiss my boy is a canzonet, to suck him off a sonnet; his mouth is a madrigal, his lips are lyrics, and his eyes idylls; to be beneath him is an epithalamium, and on top of him an epic. 14.

A common piece of mild chaff to a harlot (male or female) is: \"Why have you stuck rouge ([Persian] Ghaza) on your face? In order to stick a Ghazi to your bottom!\" 33. Black-violet: so in text [Persian]. A black mole, in Sufi cipher, means the \"point of indivisible unity\". But El Haji more scandalously and obviously chooses the podex itself throughout most of his masterpiece. 34. Friday. This appears at first sight an obvious misreading.

To punish them, Allah hung them by their heels in a well at Babylon, where they wile away the time by giving magical instruction. The meaning, therefore, (argal!) of the whole passage is that unredeemed (i.e. uninitiated) man, however ordinarily devout, is liable to become a sorcerer! I cannot help thinking that Mahbub must have been hung up by his heels at one time; nobody could ever think all that out right way up. 51.

Reputed aphrodisiacs. In reality of little more use than the boasted South American Damiana. Chobchini (wood of China) is the \"ginseng\" of Sze-chuen and Corea. The modern biological methods of restoring sexual vigour are interesting. Brown-Sequard prepared a testicular infusion, but this was not found - everywhen, everywhere, and by all - a success. To-day they kill a goat, obtain the semen while the animal is still not quite dead, and preserve by a special process. Such a decoction, even when a year old, exhibits live and active spermatozoa when warmed by an experienced microscopist on the stage of a good instrument. Injected under the skin, it produces magnificent results, both as a general tonic and a cure for impotence. Thus the goat, deposed from his Satanic glory, and proved (like a young virgin) useless in gonorrhoea, has at last found his causa finalis in the laboratories of Chicago.

The value of the orchitic substance is stated to be assured in the treatment of well-defined cases, particularly in cerebral depression, failure of reproductive power, premature senility, nervous asthenia, neurasthenia, etc. In these complaints the employment of the orchitic substance gives hood results by stimulating the nervous system, by increasing the power of work, and also the secretions, the proportion of haemoglobin and the vital resistance, etc. Such results are partially explained by the chemical composition of the orchitic extracts, which are extremely rich in organic phosphorus. The results are similar to those obtained by the use of the Glycero-phosphates and Lecithins. Preparations. 1. Orchitic Desiccated powder (Armour).

According to Mahbub, this is an attack on the Q'uran. (He being like so many Persians to-day not only a Sufi, but a follower in secret of El Baab, delights to point out these things). For furious [Persian] is a pun on [Persian] Salir, a prophet, who converted some of the Thamud Tribe by producing a camel from a stone (Q'uran Cap. VII).

Omar - See Burton's 'Pilgrimage' for facts about this caliph, highly honoured by the orthodox Muslim, but detested by the \"'Arami\" (Persian) who ever seek to defile his tomb, often risking their lives in the attempt. Frequent is the pun between Omar and Hhumar \"ass\".

Presumably the Nubian's; but the text is ambiguous. 73. A pun [Persian] means both \"rock\" and a jinn who offended King Solomon.

Cf. \"All your righteousness is as filthy rags.\" 84. Shahrava. A king who forced a leather currency on his subjects. Dildos in Persia being usually made of leather, the jest is double-edged. To present a dildo, or anything which might by any possibility be used as such, to a courtesan is a deadly insult, implying \"You cannot attract a live man\", and she will assuredly have you murdered sooner or later if she can. 85. A proverb and a pun, [Persian] denial, [Persian] splendour. 86. Again a long explanation from Mahbub. The soul (he says) falls from 66 [Persian] to 45 ([Persian] Adam, man).

But God transfixes the dragon-camel with an arrow [Hebrew] Samekh 60 \"Temperance\" the 15th letter of the alphabet), and 60 + 45 = 105 = 21 x 5, or the Perfect Crown 3 x 7 [Persian] in the 5 quarters of the perfected Man, the Cross replaced by the Pentagram. 87.

Burton is, I think, a little hard on them when he writes: \"What conscience has the murderous Moor, who slays his guest with felon blow?\" 95. Ass of the member of honey [Persian]. So Mahbub's expansion of the \"portmanteau\" text [Persian] Khazk'asal. 96. Refers to a fable. An elephant had fallen into a pit, but managed to scramble out. Seeing an ass going in that direction, he kindly warned him. The ass disdainfully replied that he, being light, ran little danger. Ay! said the elephant, but small and without an hand, how will thou escape if thou *dost* fall? And in fact the ass fell, and perished miserably.M 97. The same phrase is used as in the story of this name in Alf Laylah wa Laylah. Possibly some satire is concealed; but my munshi failed to make me see the joke. 98. Shahrava was a despot who forced leather money into circulation. The passage means, according to Mahbub, that El Qahar will not use a leather dildo, but his own stalwart member, upon the podex of Habib; but I prefer to think that he simply means \"I will not beat thee\" i.e. with leather thongs. In all countries beating is jestingly spoken of as \"payment\". Besides, the whole ode concerns active punishment, not mere deprivation of pleasure.N 99. [Persian] the word used here \"has the value of 180, which is 4 times 45, so it means that his guardian angel is on all sides of him\". So Mahbub! 100. All this implies that the adept has by now acquired the complete control of his mind and his senses. If a camel is shewn to the ordinary man, he is compelled to see a camel, and cannot persuade himself that it is a house or an ox. If a drum is beaten near him, he is obliged to hear a drum, not a fife or a viol. But the adept can easily put himself out of gear with his senses, and awake others; as, for instance, he can awake the supernal taste by concentrating his thought upon the centre of his tongue; hearing, upon the root; and touch, upon the tip. 101. There ought to be a proverb \"You may lead the camel to the river; but you cannot make him swim\" for impotence is in Persia as elsewhere the penalty of age and excess. But as far as I know, there is not. 102. The grave Persian literally screams with laughter whenever his poet quotes the Q'uran in a blasphemous sense; just as our own people with the Bible. 103. A last touch of the whip."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"XI 104. As a witty Irishman remarks, \"There is only one argument that will convince a woman - the argument in a circle\". 105. A very profound allegory. Laila being the Jinn, this passage means that since the revelation of the Method of true communion between man and God, magic or dealing with Jinn should be left to Jews (and other heathen), stigmatized as goat-faced because of their materialistic or gross views of the universe. The Haji was however accused of Christianizing tendencies on account of this passage, since Christians repressed magic so severely, and in spite of his stout denials. To this day many singers \"mak' siccar\" of the approval of the orthodox by altering the words to \"Christian Jew\". 106. The Sanskrit root Sar \"head\" has given to Europe and Asia the word for ruler; as Sar, sir, sieur, Caesar, Sarah, Kaiser, Tsar, Shah, sirdar, sirkar, sire, signor, senor, siegneur, and a host of others. 107. [Persian] the temple at Mecca. But I think here it means the House not made with hands. The letter [Persian] itselfO means house, and connotes (says Mahbub) a great Magus -\"The Magus of Power\". The passage means therefore that mystic Union is the key to Practical Magic. 108. This sort of individualization of ideas is common in Eastern literature. We had a bad attack of it ourselves with Thomas Haines Bayley and Co. Though Custom may frown upon Boyhood and Beauty, And Ethics take counsel with Prudence and Breeding, Morality smiles \"But if Patience be Duty, Should Courage lament, or Repentance lie bleeding?\" And so though on Conscience' [sic] inviolate altar We strew the sad flowers of Repulsion and Shame, Religion and Justice must bid us not falter Till Purity mingles with Pleasure and Fame. You go on till your stock of abstract nouns is exhaustedP. 109. Roses etc. - the cheeks, teeth, and lips. 110. I have heard the claim that the substance of porcelain can be so impregnated with scent that \"You may break, you may shatter - etc.\" But I never saw a piece that withstood honest washing with hot soap and water; and I don't believe it. 111. This simile seems well-nigh universal; but in Persia it probably comes from Egypt rather than from India. Here the sense is of course altered. 112. Yusuf - possibly represents that class of persons who ridicule and slander the Mystic. The epithets seem to uphold such a conclusion. 113. The Q'uran. Many Moslems know it by heart throughout. The interior riming of so many of the chapters makes this task curiously easy, even to a stranger. I found that I could readily master any of the shorter chapters in an hour or so, while the acquirement of a dozen stray words would last me the whole day. 114. This attempt to reconcile all-Power and all-Benevolence is formally identical with that of the veriest Evangelical, and is none the less shameless casuistry for its Oriental phraseology. "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"XII 115. This is a common practical joke among friends. The recalcitrant pathic is treated more severely by sharp taps on the coccyx with the knuckle, dagger-hilt, or tent-peg. Genuine obstinacy would lead to the slitting of the muscle, and the summoning of all bystanders to assist, each in his turn, at the resultant \"sure thing\". 116. All this seems curious, since tightness is such a desideratum. But I take it that the ideal condition is a close fit, like a kid glove; and of course one which needs much stretching is best. 117. All this is the orthodox Sufi method of explaining the origin of Evil, which, as monotheists, they are compelled to ascribe to Allah. We have much similar casuistry in the West. 118. So our best M.S. [Persian] But [sic??] [Persian] flesh –meaning buttocks- sounds more likely. Consideration of prosody support the text. 119. Meteor-struck: meteors are the stones flung by the angels at the Jinn who pry into Heaven. This epithet confirms our view of the allegory. 120. Eunuchs. Those from whom the testicles only are removed can still copulate, and experience sexual orgasm, though of course no fecundation results. Hence the possibility of Gibbon's remark that a certain lady \"preferred the titillations of her favourite eunuch to the ponderous emballings of the Roman praetor\"; and of Martial's epigram: \"Cur tantum eunuchos habeat tua Gellia, quaeris, Pannice? vult frui Gellia, non parere\". 121. This jest depends on the pun -a somewhat significant one!- between [Persian] unconscious, stupefied and [Persian] matron, a virtuous woman. 122. An excellent prescription. Olive oil is of course meant. 123. For the use of the refrain the reader may consult any manual on Persian prosody. El Haji has made several innovations. 124. How beautiful and touching are these similes! No artifice, so straining of the metaphor is involved; the poet rests in calm and beatific certitude of \"a good death, and a joyful resurrection in His holy kingdom!\" Yet there is no false piety, no arrogance; and like every straight-living man, he is capable of honest laughter, almost in the same breath. 125. A river which flows by the ruins of Chilminar. 126. Cedar -dove's down. By no means chosen at random; symbolically chosen, or perhaps even because these substances have a reputed value in mystical practices. Apollonius of Tyana (? connection with Dhyana) was accustomed to wrap himself completely in a woollen garment in order to perform magic - presumably with some idea of \"insulation\". Cedar is esteemed highly as incense. The passage may mean: \"I will float heavenward on the perfume of my adoration, being insulated from the world by my love (or the Holy Spirit) under That Tree.\" i.e. the Tree of Life. 127. Evidently refers to the physiological sensations experienced in some mystical practice - perhaps Pranayama or one of its congeners. 128. Kir - membrum virile."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"XIII 129. This simile, like that of the lotus-leaf in India, is the invariable expression of the life \"unspotted from the world\". 130. Hajj -here used of the actual procession of pilgrims. 131. The official leader of the Hajj, usually appointed by the Padishah. 132. Dirham -a coin, equivalent according to Darmstetter to about 13s. 6d of our money. But the word is used very loosely to imply a piece of money, so that 100 dirhams here probably stands for a shilling or less. Just so in India \"rupee\" means any coin. \"Jahanpana ghulamko rupaiye dijiye\" \"May the Support of the Universe be pleased to bestow rupees upon (his) slave!\" is adequately answered by any sum from a halfpenny upwards. 133. Kaffur means Camphor, white wax, and is a lucus a non lucendo insult given to unusually black slaves. 134. Though both Mohammedans and Jews are circumcised, there is a difference in the technique of the operation which would enable an expert to tell at a glance to which religion a man belonged. It is alleged by some that the toughening and hardening of the glans penis which results from the operation predisposes to sodomy, inasmuch as a greater intensity of friction is required to produce emission. True, but a moist and flabby vulva of gigantic size is poor fun for anybody. Undoubtedly, a hardened tool does (in mathematical language) \"flatten the curve\" of rising excitement, and this is the secret alike of giving and receiving pleasure. The Hindu bayadere compares the average Sahib to a village cock, and the passionate Englishwoman jeers at her brutal and hasty husband for his \"two-puffs-and-a-spit\" performances. 135. It is more than possible that the Haji had some unpleasant experience of the magistracy, or at least a personal spite against one of its members. For the symbolizing of Fate by human law is not so obvious to a Persian as to an Englishman: in Persia the defendant has plenty of free will, if he has plenty of cash. But our poet flourished no doubt in a Golden Age. 136. The word used here is [Persian] 'hearing' and also \"the Song and Dance of the Mevliviyeh dervishes\". Thus far Palmer; and I can learn no more. But probably the word is used to emphasize the purely religious nature of the passion. 137. Chob-chini, wood of China, a root highly reputed as an aphrodisiac. In China the jinseng of Sze-chuan and Korea is most esteemed. That of America is not so good, in the fatherland-dizzied eyes of the CelestialQ. 138. Suleiman -our King Solomon, as historical as King Brahmadatta, who reigned 120,000 years in Benares. 139. Isa -Jesus. Muslims hold that a phantom was crucified in the place of Jesus. See Q'uran III. 140. Gold - noon, not sunrise, or sunset, whose colours are rose and grey. A question of clinometer. 141. They who worship Allah give pleasure to themselves, but He profiteth not at all thereby. (Mahbub's comment). 142.

'De mensis'. Taylor."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"XIV 143. Once union with God is attained, the whole of life (or perhaps religion) becomes pleasant. 144. May perhaps refer to the \"horror of great darkness\" which comes, say the Mystics, to an Aspirant on the Threshold of IlluminationR. 145. Obscure throughout, and the two last stanzas seem quite inconsequential. They may have been transferred from another Ghazal by some presumptuous scribeS. 146. Identical with a phrase in Dhammapada, the Buddhist \"Book of Proverbs\". 147. Mirrikh. Mars the planet. 148. I have often seen Mars -in the Red Sea especially- with its apparent diameter something like a quarter that of the moon, and its brightness sufficient to wake me, who am the soundest of sleepers. Thus seen for the first time it is a stupendous and astounding phenomenon. 149. i.e. with a circular motion. The art of working the hips in coition, called by the Romans Ars CrissandiT is in the East as complex and profound as that of music. It requires as much study as theology, and much practice as billiards. 150. An hardly obvious analogy. Boccaccio's use of it is a curious coincidence. 151. Persia. Not to be confused with [Persian] Iram, the legendary Paradise which Sheddad ibn 'Ad is said to have established somewhere in Arabia. 152. That is, God has delivered the Means of Grace to all men; it is notorious. In one M.S. this ode ends here with the couplet \"Deceive me not; for El Qahar thy Lord Ripe is for cuddling -and for punishing\". But this is very inferior, and would have to be transferred to the early part of the odes. Which the secret key-number forbids. Habib is by now far too high an adept to fall away from Grace. 153. This is a very profane jest. Ostensibly, of course, the verse means that mystics are the salt of the faith. But Islam means \"resignation\" or \"submission\". In wooing a lover your conquest is his submission, and your penis widens out his anus. The old sodomite is as keen to promulgate his vice as his religion, the dog! 154. A mystical fact. The rationalist objection is put satirically. 155. One of the few touches of satire in the work. But perhaps he is referring to the belief that the Messiah is to be born of sodomitic connection. No doubt many Mussulmen would seduce boys on this transparent pretext. 156. Before prayer the Moslem must recite a prayer of purification. If he is ceremonially impure, as after copulation or other bodily function, he must in addition wash the parts. Excellent accounts of the two forms of both are given by Burton, Payne, Lane, Palmer, and others. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"XV 157. God -not Noah. But the grape here means the physical basis of Ecstasy. 158. The word used here is not [Persian] but [Persian] the square root (arithmetic). Possibly a pun with the word [Persian] jazbat, which I have translated \"charm\". However there is (according to Mahbub) a mystic truth concealed. Arithmetic like all sciences was at one time considered magical by the vulgar; to this day the \"magic squares\" of numbers of which the simplest cast is:   4 9 2    3 5 7    8 1 6 are attributed to the planets, and credited with supernatural powers. There is an Arab saying - I think by Averrhoes -(only recently dead) determined to discover the nature of God by working out the square root of 3. He is said to have engraved over a thousand pounds weight of thin silver plates -supplied by the faithful- with the minute characters of his calculations. At his death these plates were distributed and of course worked innumerable miracles. Should such a plate come in the possession of any Englishman, he will probably be puzzled; this note may enlighten him. The plate I saw - but could not buy - was some 18 inches square, nearly as flexible as platinum foil, and contained some 320,000 characters, at a rough estimate. The 1,000 pounds' weight seems to me an absurd overstatement. 159. Refers, in all probability, to the reddening of the buttocks. The Persians supposed the smaller capillary blood-vessels to be nerves. 160. Imam -a leader of prayer. Muslims have no \"priests\" in the sense of paid mediators. 161. Mushtari -also Birjis [Persian] is the planet Jupiter. Most nations seem to attribute a blue or violet colour to it; for mystical reasons, doubtless, but also because (to my eyes at least) it actually has that colour. 162. I suspect, maugre Mahbub's head, that this is \"writ sarcastic\". The pompous old dullard must have seemed to our lively Abdullah very much as Southey did to Byron. Yet the Eastern is a terrible slave to convention, and may perhaps acquiesce in Hafiz as the undergraduate of to-day acquiesces in Milton. 163. The central thought of these two chapters is represented in the Buddhist philosophy, perhaps; but in the Hindu practice, certainly. It is true that the Hindu claims the extinction of self in Parabrahm (Jivatma in Paramatma) as the phenomenon in question; but this is clearly a petitio principii, since we can always retort that any perception however glorious is less than the brain which perceives it. The Hindu would (idly) retort that this perception was not the phenomenon, but only one's very partial and imperfect memory thereof. And the logician would retort - and we should soon get quite beyond the limits of a note. 164. This is the very same old fable we learnt about the Tower of Babel. 165. Jilt -the Persian has a coarser word- our English \"cockteaser\". But a translator must be allowed both latitude and modesty. 166. Surely Oriental exaggerationU. 167. Goat-hair -the \"pashmina\" of Kashmir; so says Mahbub the Kashmiri; but I suspect him of patriotism and believe the text to read 'pustin' [Persian] a fur pelisse spread out as a quiltV. "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"XVI 168. This perhaps refers to a posture of coition described in the other \"Scented Garden\". The lady is hung from the roof by a belly-band, while her husband (let us hope) stands on a stool, and swings her to and fro, catching her vulva from behind on his penis. This is continued until emission. The true sportsman refrains from guiding either the lady or his penis with his hands. The length of the swing should not be less than 4 or 5 feet; under these rules the game is excellent. With a boy it would however be incomparably more difficult, if not impossible. The text suggests though that the boy is fixed, while the man swings. This should be easier of execution. 169. Death in the East rides a camel, not a white horse. 170. Bedawin -any wanderers. But the homeless necessarily live by robbery. Hence the paradoxes of Socialism. 171. Lit. sharp as [Persian] zu'l faqar, the sword of Mohammed which he captured on the field of Badr. A sort of Eastern Excalibur, by the usual mythopoetic process. 172. I confess to fantastic license in translation of this curious passage. But some of the words are not Persian or anything else, and two or three seemed me formed in this manner. For example, I have translated [Persian] \"Allah knows\" reasonably enough; and [Persian] Shayadistan, Perhaps - country, is well for \"maybe\", while [Persian] \"happy memory\" justifies \"Sweetitwas\". But what shall I say of [Persian] and the rest - mangled though suggestive roots? Possibly the poet knew very little about ships and their name. 173. Jolly Roger -again a coarse expression, best untranslated. The notorious debauchery of pirate ships, and the slang verb \"Roger\" (futuere) suggested the present phrase. 174. The text would justify us in reading \"rounded pearls\" [Persian] fairy (peri of Moore) and [Persian] fullness. Where there was doubt, we have chosen what seemed the more poetical reading. 175. Some M.S. end with this Takhallus. See note 180. 176. This and the following stanzas seem inconsequent. But they contain profound allusions. The thousand eyes of the peacock's tail are equivalent to the thousand petals of the Sahasrara lotus in India; the divine lotus that only exists as a throne for the descending Shiva upon his devotee. The eunuch's voice is the shrill sound heard by adepts at the moment of union with the divine. The garden is of course the sphere of the trained soul. 177. This is a very literal translation; it is either an accident, or shows a high degree of scientific knowledge. The dependence of sound on air was discovered in Europe by Hawksbee in 1705. (Hawksbee first performed the \"bell in vacuo\" experiment in 1705. Newton (Principia Vol. III, 1687), gave an inaccurate formula for Velocity of Sound in Air and other fluids. Laplace nearly one year later corrected this. But we do not wish to stake El Haji's reputation as a prophet on this phrase. It is perfectly open to us to read \"dies with breath\" or \"dies with mind\" the root [Persian] (Heb.[tau/vau/resh]) meaning originally wind, hence breath, hence much later \"spirit\" or \"ghost\". The Latin \"spiritus\" and Greek \"pneuma\" have an identical history, the most complete case of metaphysical sophistication in language. The elevation of the Ruach Alhim (the wind of the elements), a poetic phrase for the actual wind stirring the surface of the unfathomable deep to life, to a Person neither made nor begotten but proceeding - and the rest of it - is a phenomenon unparalleled in the long history of human folly, especially when one considers the gorgeous way in which having got a ghost from a wind, they adduce the original passage as a proof that their forefathers believed in ghosts! The secondary use of [Persian] to mean \"mind\" is however reasonable enough, and possibly the Yogic process is responsible. Early mystics (or psychologists) would naturally observe the extreme instability of the consciousness as its most obvious characteristic, and name it from the most unstable phenomenon in nature known to the primitives, wind."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"XVII 178. V. 14 is the saying of Mansur el Hallaj \"I am Truth and in my coat is wrapped nothing but God”. He was stoned by more orthodox Arabs, and his blood traced \"An' el Haqq\" on the ground. 179. Gem [Persian] Guhr. The Fable of the Cock and the Dunghill probably sprang from so childish a source as the pun between Guhr and Guh [Persian] (dung). It is more obvious in the oblique Guh-ra and Guhr-ra. 180. The last three verses are probably spurious. Verse 11 supplies a natural end, with the takhallusW. 181. Ascetic. Zahid, indifferently to represent the fat easy-going, conventional materialist, self-styled orthodox, common to all religions, and the desperate devotee who does not set his life at a pin's fee when heaven is at stake. El Haji probably wishes to kill the two birds with one stone. 182. Another hint that all Religion is subjective; and that consequently mean men are Evangelicals, gross men Roman Catholics, cowards believers in Eternal Punishment, sensual and sentimental men Universalists, and so on. Such a rationalistic view of the Genesis of Creed is uncommon enough in Eastern literature, though the general Fichtean positing of the non-Ego by the Ego implied in the previous stanza is to be found openly or obscurely in most sacred books. 183. This stanza is almost certainly spurious. 184. This is the old jest: \"As long as you drink a drop of this medicine daily, you will not die\". Though perhaps the erectio penis of the hanged may give the lie to the jape. 185. In fact, I saw a very beautiful copy so inlaid on thin sheets of ivory in the house of a wealthy whoremaster. 186. I have seen such women in Tehuantepee, Moharbhanj, and other places. But even en English woman acquires the human figure if deprived of stays, and made to walk several hours a day for a number of months. 187. A very convenient doctrine: all this -(This note appears unfinished.) I wish one could teach it to the English wife, for ever on the groan as she is that she is neglected, and then crying out again when one gets her with child. The solution of the sex-problem is given in the Arab proverb, \"Women for children, and boys for pleasure\". I strongly advocate the putting of women in their proper sphere; they should breed, nurse, educate, and perform those physical tasks for which their coarser nervous system and lack of intelligence fit them. But no woman is a fit companion for a man; she of necessity degrades him. Luckily, in the case of the best men, she disgusts him. How many women have left any mark on history, save by the excess of their impudicities and whoredoms? We must exclude those born to queendom. I can think but of one, Jeanne d'Arc, an example of the opposite abnormality, frigidity. 188. The Sodom-fable is to be found in the XVth chapter of the Q'uran. Moslems accept the Bible, so far as it goes. Only they regard the Christian as the Christian regards the Jew: as one not up-to-date. Big fleas have small fleas, etc. quoth the bard; and the modern follower of El Baab and the Baha-i-Ullah says the same to the orthodox Muslim. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"XVIII 189. An allusion to a well-known tale, perhaps to be identified in Alf Laylah wa Laylah. A chief returning from some expedition, finds his favourite wife in the embraces of one of his sons. He reproaches her, saying: Am I not the maker superior to whom I made? (quoting, I fancy, the Q'uran). She replied than women might lawfully treasure the poem and press it to their hearts, but that it would be highly scandalous if they treated the poets in that manner. 190. We are not inclined to regard the \"if\" as sceptical, but as a strong form of affirmation. \"As sure as Allah exists, He exists not only in temples made by men for His worship, but in all the beauty He has created\". This at least is the line of defence attempted by those orthodox Muslim who cannot quite forgive Abdullah -or forget him. 191. Taken by a parallel construction to Maker-Made. The absurdity is not so glaring in Persian, owing to the system of \"modes\" by which from each root is extracted a great number of derivatives, according to fixed rules. The Satire is of course against those who think that the difficulty of self-created matter is overcome by postulating a self-created God. Thus [Persian] Jade might become [Persian] a maker of Jade, were only Jade a *verbal* root. As [Persian] slayer from the root [Persian] to slay. 192. The Takhallus being absent from this Ghazal, it is either spurious or unfinished; or else affords us a ground for rejecting those Ghazals which but for the Takhallus would be declared not to be authentic. This latter view has guided us to some extent in this editionX. 193. These similes are very affected. 194. See note 195. 195. Dinar - a gold coin worth about 10/-. 196. Evidently the reviewer is as old as the world. 197. Pious folk - Wahhabi [Persian] the Muslim strictarians. 198. Obscure. I doubt if the Q'uran forbids sodomy. See Q'uran XV, where the fault of the people appears to be their breach of hospitality, always a stigma in primitive communities. The Bible is just as broadminded on the point, both in the Story of Sodom and that of the Levite. Maybe \"Allah\" is a slip for \"Mullah\" - a difference of only one letter. 199. The bowl of the pipe of the sphere of the heavens; the tobacco is the benevolence of God: the live coal His glory and desire toward man: the water in the bowl is the veil which prevents man being burnt up in that glory, and the purifying influence of calm upon the soul; the smoke is the perfume of the Spirit of God; the tube is the Influence (Heb. Mezla) from on high; the mouthpiece the love of one's earthly teacher; (This sounds as though Sufi confessors shared the predilections and privileges of Jesuit confessors) the inhalation is the enlightenment of the soul; the exhalation the holy influence shed by the Sufi upon his fellow man -and so on. Mahbub was perfectly willing to explain every phrase in the book along these lines; reasonable people will agree that a single sample is enough. But see the note on XXXVIIIth Ghazal. 200. Aristu -Aristotle. Most sensible men will heartily agree with these sentiments. El Qahar is more than mystic and sodomite; he is a practical person. But perhaps the unusual word huqqa is a pun on hukm (command) and the phrase means, \"As long as I obey God's law, I care nothing for philosophy!\"Y 201. This ode is by most considered spurious, or the work of a pupil on a skeleton left by the master. But the very stigmata [sic] on which this view is based - the absence of the Takhallus, and of the word \"kun\" – "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"XIX seem to us to point the other way. No forger would have omitted so simple a precaution. It is possible that the ode is incomplete. More reasonable seems the suggestions that el Haji (1) disliked the introduction of his holy word [Persian] and of his sacred Name in an ode of this type - as a kind of extra insult to the Mullah; (2) feared stoning if he signed it. The strongest argument for its genuineness is that the secret key-letter is right; if we cancelled the ode it would make nonsense of all the following ones. Unless indeed, this ode replaces a genuine one. For which there is not a jot or tittle of evidence. 202. This is the boldest attack on orthodoxy that we have met in Eastern literature. The paternity of Islam - its divine origin - is said to be uncertain; the character of Mohammed, it mother, is vilified, the suggestion being that he received the Q'uran from all sorts of evil spirits; while of the religion itself he asserts dullness and inutility. 203. The old humbug - lit. this Saiyid of Samera. A Saiyid is one of Mohammed's own tribe; but at Samera there is an establishment for forging pedigrees, in all respects precisely similar to our own Herald's College. 204. Combined with the information in 31, that the Mullah is one-eyed, this suggests that el Haji wishes to identify him with [Persian] dajjal, Antichrist, who is usually spoken of as a one-eyed man riding upon an ass. Thus he may mean: \"The Spirit of Orthodoxy is the spirit of Antichrist\". It would at least be in keeping with the rest of his opinions, and the symbol is lucid and keen. 205. One M.S. has \"cornered\" (shashdar shudan), a technical term in backgammon, when the game, though not actually finished, is seen to be hopeless for one of the players. 206. This is the Rabelasian jest - the story of Hans Carvels ring - in Eastern dress. 207. Again a confusion. He refers to the Sufi, not to the ZahidZ. 208. Anyone who has practised even for a short time any of the Eastern systems of meditation will realize the force of this remark. No person who has not practised can realize how swift and numerous our impressions are. Under ordinary circumstances the great majority do not rise into consciousness at all, for one is occupied with one main current of ideas. But once the mind seeks to check all possible currents of ideas, the simple impressions rise into the vacant space, which is fairly bombarded. 209. \"Into one wave all the wavelets\" is the Hindu equivalent for this. El Baab, when the orthodox took him out to be shot, having dug holes in his skin and filled them with lighted bamboo-shoots dipped in wax, is said to have observed:  These are many flamelets,   and will soon expire, but my soul is One Flame,  and will not. And there is a tale of an harlot, who retorted on some men who reviled her: \"You are like the raindrops; but this my vulva is One Pool\". They stoned her for the blasphemy. 210. Zemzem. The holy well at Mecca. Its waters are excessively foul, and even the most devout make a wry face when drinking them. 211. Jasmine podex - surely a true perversion of sense!

Observe that the very idea of irrumation never once enters his pure mind. The subject of this peculiar vice is a very extended one. I think that the orthodox Muslim probably fears the defilement of his mouth, or that of his lover. He would not object to being thus excited by a woman, who is already from crown to sole one mass of filth. Prejudiced as I am in favour of the Unfair Sex, I cannot but see this. Like Balaam, I am constrained. But if anyone wishes to argue with me, I may point out that -it happened beforeCC. 215. Suraiya - the Pleiades. 216. Hell. 217. The passage in brackets is certainly spurious. We retain it as shewing the ingenuity of interpretation employed in this class of literature. 218. The natural (though hardly altogether just) contempt of the practical expert for the arm-chair critic. 219. Surely Oriental exaggeration. 220. Can this be a reference to the Western superstition that mystic devotion injures the intellect? Or only to the dangers of \"obsession', to the appalling results which occasionally occur when the processes are ill performed? I cannot but give my adhesion to the former theory: at this stage of the poem el Haji is attacking sceptics and orthodox people: there is no imperfection in his love. 221. El Haji's Materialism. There is nothing strange to an Oriental in the theory that emotions and thought depend upon bodily changes. All books on Philosophy teach or imply this, in direct contradiction to the silly metaphysical theories of thought which pass current in the West. Yet they hold that all depend, ring within ring, upon the central point, God. If the Eastern is an idealist, it is the idealism of Malebranche or Berkeley; if a sceptic, it is the scepticism of Huxley or Hume; if a materialist, it is the materialism of Leibnitz or the earlier Kant. 222. Charles' wain -the Great Bear, the Car of David, and many other names, all equally absurd. 223. We do not know whether this can possibly have any reference to a local custom. In Egypt the rising of Sirius heralded various obscene religious festivals. Our own view is that the best signal for beginning a love-affair is the rising of - but no matter! 224. Shaitan - Satan. It is however a generic name for an evil spirit. 225. Lion. The Persian, with the Scot and the Cingalee, claims a lion for his emblem. "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"XXI 226. After this ode the \"secret key-number\" breaks down. It is said that there are five odes missing. But no doubt need therefore be cast upon the genuineness of the following odes. Some weight is to be given to the contention that there can be only 42 odes, neither more nor less, for mystical reasons. Their Persian dress I cannot learn; but the Egyptians knew 42 Gods who purify the soul; and the Jews speak of the \"Revolution of the 42-fold Name of the Palaces of Yetzirah\" -the world which should invade and redeem this material scheme of things. Talking of this \"scheme of things\", I remember the wit of a certain comely youth at Oxford, who reproached his exhausted lover with the quatrain: Ah love! could Thou and I with Fate conspire To grasp this sorry scheme of things entire, Would we not shatter it to bits, and then Remould it nearer to the heart's desire. 227. [Persian] huqqah. It is said that this word represents heiroglyphically the process of smoking. [Persian] the harsh aspirate changed to [Persian] the smooth aspirate by the medium of the force of [Persian] which Arab mystics describe as being \"of a watery, lunar nature, and consonant to dogs, jackals, beetles, pools, old women painted, dreams, water pots, drunkenness, illusion, broken spears, and astrologers\". In this case the watery nature symbolizes the rose-water through which the smoke is drawn to purify and soften it. 228. Cannabis - Hashish, bhang, ganja, marijuana, kif, a drug much used by Yogis and Fakirs. It induces maniacal attacks, destroys the sense of proportion in time and space, and gives powerful emotions to its victims. 229. Ambergris. Without much perfume of its own, it is priceless for bringing out the best of any others with which it may be mixed. The price in 1906 was 135 shillings the ounce. 230. i.e. it is useless to explore the universe until the problem of personality is satisfactorily settled. 231. Hakim - doctor. 232. Gonorrhoea is known in Persia as elsewhere. At a recital, when all the young men exclaim joyfully: \"What flowing stanzas!\" (suz), an old cynic may be heard to mutter: \"What flowing gleet!\" (Suzak). 233. Cf. Canticles; and Matthew, \"What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\" 234. Refers to the Ghazi, still a terror to our Frontier officials in N. W. India. The method of manufacture is interesting. A poor and despairing man is selected and watched. One night, as he slinks through some deserted beggar's haunt, he is secretly drugged and conveyed to a palatial house with gardens and fountains. He awakes to find himself robed in fine linen and purple, surrounded by rich wines and foods, and by an adoring bevy of the most luscious beauties that he can imagine. He is however always kept to a certain extent under the influence of hashish, in order to bewilder him slightly, and to cause him partially to doubt the reality of his present joy. In a week or so he is again drugged, dressed in his old rags, and abandoned in the same beggar's haunt as before. He wakes up utterly miserable, and consults the local Mullah as to his experience. \"My son!\" replies the good man \"favoured of Heaven! You have had a vision of the realms of Paradise\". He naturally wants to know how to get back, and the Mullah reiterates the well-known blessing on those who die, slaying infidels, and further indicates such and such a Sahib - who has probably made himself obnoxious to the faithful in some way - as a suitable person to attack. Lord Curzon however very wisely met this manoevre by ordering the cremation of murderers of this type. If the body of a Mussulman is burnt he cannot go to Paradise; for the os coccygis, from which God will raise his body from the dust, is destroyed. But it would probably be waste of time to explain all this to Mr. Keir Hardie."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"XXII 235.

The Vindu-Siddhi, power of retaining the semen, is one of the most interesting and important branches of Hathayoga, the Hindu \"Physical Culture\". The following from the Shiva Sanhita, concerning the Vajroli Mudra, affords an adequate example of the method and aim. 53. Actuated by mercy for my devotees, I shall now explain the *Vajroli Mudra*, the destroyer of the darkness of the world, the most secret among all the secrets. 54. Even while following all his desires, and without conforming to the regulations of Yoga, a householder can become emancipated, if he practices the VAJROLI-MUDRA. 55. This VAJROLI-YOG practice, gives emancipation even when one is immersed in sensuality; therefore it should be practised by the Yogi with great care. 56. First let the talented practitioner introduce into his own body, according to the proper methods, the germ-cells from the female organ of generation, by suction up through the tube of the *meatus urinarius*; restraining in his own semen, let him practise copulation. If by chance the semen begins to move, let him stop its emission by the practice of the YONI-MUDRA. Let him place the semen on the left hand duct, and stop further intercourse. After a while, let him continue it again. In accordance with the instructions of his preceptors, and by uttering the sound *hoom*, let him forcibly draw up through the contraction of the *Apana Vayu* the germ-cells from the uterus. 57. The Yogi, worshipper of the lotus-feet of his Guru should, in order to obtain quick success in Yoga, drink milk or nectar in this way. 58. Know semen to be moon-like, and the germ-cells the emblem of sun; let the Yogi make their union in his own body with great care. 59. I am the semen. *Sakti* (the goddess) is the germ fluid: when they both are combined, then the Yogi reaches the state of success, and his body becomes brilliant and divine. 60. Ejaculation of semen is death, preserving it within is life; therefore, let the Yogi preserve his semen with great care. 61. Verily, verily, men are born and die through semen; knowing this, let the Yogi always practise to preserve his semen. 62. When through great efforts success in the preservation of the semen is obtained, what then cannot be achieved in this world? Through the greatness of this preservation (i.e., through celibacy) one becomes like me in glory. "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"XXVI 63. The vindu (semen) causes the pleasure and pain of all creatures living in this world, who are infatuated, and are subject to death and decay. For the Yogi, this preservation of semen is the best of all Yogas, and it is the giver of happiness. 64. Though immersed in enjoyments, men get powers through its practice. Through the force of his practice, he becomes an adept in due season, in his present life. 65. The Yogi certainly obtains through this practice all kinds of powers at the same time enjoying all the innumerable enjoyments of the world. 66. This Yoga can be practised along with much enjoyment; therefore the Yogi should practise it. 67. There are two modifications of the VAJROLI, called Sahajoni, and Amarani. By all means let the Yogi preserve the semen. 68. If at the time of copulation, the vindu is forcibly emitted, and there takes place a union of the sun and moon, then let him absorb this mixture through the tube of the male organ. This is Amarani. 69. The method by which the vindu on the point of emission can be withheld through YONI-MUDRA, is called Sahajoni. It is kept secret in all the Tantras. 70. Though ultimately the action the (*Amarani* and *Sahajoni*) is the same, there are arisen [sic] difference owing to the difference of nomenclature. Let the Yogi practise them with the greatest care and perseverance. 71. Through love for my devotees, I have revealed this Yoga; it should be kept secret with the greatest care, and not be given to everybody. 72. It is the most secret of all secrets that ever were or shall be; therefore let the prudent Yogi keep it with the greatest secrecy possible. 73. When in the time of voiding urine, the Yogi draws it up forcibly through the Apana-Vayu, and keeping it up, discharges it slowly and slowly; and practises this daily according to the instructions of his Guru, he obtains the *vindusiddhi* (power over semen), that gives great powers. 74. He who practises this daily according to the instructions of his Guru does not lose semen, were he to enjoy a hundred women at a time. 75. O PARVATI! When *vindu-siddhi* is obtained, what else cannot be accomplished? Even the inaccessible glory of my godhead can be attained through it. 245. The angel to whom is allotted the duty of sounding \"the last trump\". 246. Sodom -a legendary city, said to have been destroyed by a volcano. But it has a mystic meaning.

But it is further the true and secret unpronounceable Name of God, concealed by its obviousness. The 100th name, about which people make such a fuss, is simply Allah [Persian] itself, the other 99 merely replacing Allah in the sentence Hua Allahu alazi wailaha illa Hua, thus: Hua Arrahmanu alazi etc., and so for the rest.

Now [Persian] has the value of 12. The symbolism of this number will occur to all students. But without coursing that hare to death, we may lightly touch upon the traces of Hua through the languages Hebrew Hua, English He; and note the remarkable similarity to Allah of Ille, Il, Lui, Le and so on. The Hebrew Allah is [He, Lamed, Aleph] usually transliterated by our empirics Eloah, perhaps dropping an L. because 36 is the value of [He, Lamed, Aleph] and the sum of the first nine numbers (0 to 8) 9 being the number of their Divine Sephiroth (not including Malkuth, the world) and the addition of the 10th number (9) giving them 45, the value of the name [Final Mem, Daleth, Aleph] Adam. But even the Hebrews acknowledge the superior purity of the 12 system by retaining Hua as a title of Kether, their highest emanation. Unfortunately they seem to have forgotten that Kether should itself be counted as Zero, thereby altering their whole chain of aeons and its symbolism, though it is true that, realizing the necessity of Zero as a starting point for any system, they concealed behind Kether three veils of the negative, culminating in Ain, pure negation. But this was rather an effect of the Brahminical (or post-Fichtean) metaphysic, in which an Absolute is reached by denying to it all possible predicates as thinkable and therefore derogatory. Even when one retorted, \"He is then Unthinkable\" the wary Rabbi would reply, \"Neither Thinkable nor Unthinkable\". You can't win; but you don't want to play any more! All this is far, far indeed from the true practical Qabalah, which contents itself with leading the student to the next stage, which teaches the animal to think, the thinker to aspire, the aspirant to wisdom, and crowneth the wise man with the glory of the 12 Stars, his holy Genius. Not that it is for a mere dabbler like myself to suggest to others even a line of research; but love conquers modesty, and I should like to hint that in the restoration of a duodecimal notation and cosmography lies the best hope of a perfect recovery of the perfect WayFF. 253. This is the extreme sceptico-mystical position: to admit that phenomena are perfectly mysterious, while asserting a direct consciousness of the Absolute. 254. Riddle. In the Persian are perhaps concealed some details of the Poet's life and amours. 255. Azrael -angel of death; Israfel - of the last Judgement, bear respectively a sword and a trumpet. We have taken Azrael though modern Persians usuallyGG call him Abu Yahya [Persian] \"Father John\". Some ignorant Persians confuse him with Ezekiel! Result: \"to sup with Father John\" means either to eat dirt, i.e. (apologize) or \"to die\". Hence an offended Persian in a tavern brawl, may say \"You must sup with Father John to-night\" meaning \"Retract, or I knife you\". 256. Venus-throw - the double six. The highest throw at dice. 257. Ghoul - a corpse-devouring devil. 258. Hur al Ayn. pl. of Ahwar al Ayn, our Western \"Houri\".

In deference to the wishes of the widow of the gallant soldier who penned these lines, and gave his life to his country in S.

The pathic of Laknau, when offering themselves for hire to British officers, draw long strips of muslin torn from their recta, whose perfect cleanliness is thus beyond suspicion. O si sic ommes! E.

I think it far more likely that it refers to another fable, the following, told by Persians against Omar and Ayeshah who as the daughter of Abu Bekr is supposed by the Shahs to have influenced Mohammed's conduct for evil. There are numerous scandals regarding her. Yet the more decent Persian tells the story of Zuleikah (Potiphar's wife) and of Joseph.

Yet even Browning in this passage discriminates against Earth in favour of Heaven: I suppose we are none of us perfect. Q. See note 63. R. We must beg students to observe that Major Lutiy seems to have written these notes in two moods, one in which he admits his own personal knowledge of, and identification with, mysticism; the other in which (as here) he writes as a mere scholar.

On the rare occasions of our disagreement, we have added his initials to his note, and added our own view in brackets. X. There are altogether some 80 or 1 extant Ghazals of Abdullah; fortunately in the key-letter we have a certain check on this particular series. Major Lutiy wrote his note under the idea of issuing the whole in a single volume. Y. I cannot admit that huqqa is an altogether unusual word; I think hukm rather merits the title.

I do not think that El Haji necessarily means separate and distinct emissions; he may mean thrusts.

But the discussion will prevent repetition of my false conjecture. CC. Irrumation, with either sex, is perhaps the most popular of all the sex-perversions - or sex-refinements? - in the West. A well-known English peeress of American origin has kindly favoured me with a classified list of the principal methods employed by the patient. It will be seen that they easily surpass the crude expedients of the Kama Soutra. 1. *The Spider's Legs*. Tickle the penis with fingers, lips, tongue, and eyelashes. 2. *The Fire-drill*. With flat palms rub the penis vigorously in a direction perpendicular to its axis. The tip of the penis is held firmly in the mouth. 3. *The Mouse-trap*. Nibble and kiss the penis all over, like a mouse at a piece of cheese. Suddenly nip hard on to it and finish, like the closing of the trap. 4. *Les affaires sont les affaires*. Swallow the penis whole, rocking the head furiously backwards and forwards. 5. *The Woodpecker*. Bite sharply with teeth upon the penis. 6. *The Limpet* (or *Barnacle*). Suck the gland hard, so as to create a vacuum (this is a rude cupping process, causes the blood to flow strongly to the part and so is almost unfailing as a means of producing erection). 7. *The Oyster Supper*. Spit on the penis and catch the \"oysters\" until they replaced by the \"pearls\". 8. *The Green Corn*. Suck at the penis as you do to eat green corn (i.e. all down the shaft). 9. *The Asparagus*. Suck at the penis as you do to eat asparagus (i.e. at the tip). 10. *L'eternelle idole*. Worship the penis; rub it on the forehead, and so on, according to your ideas of what a ritual should be. 11. *The Naughty Boy*. Smack the penis smartly with the hands. Afterwards make up to it, and pet it. 12. *The Sculptor*. Mould and knead with firm lips and fingers, as a sculptor models clay. 13. *The catapult*. Pull down the penis, and let it flap back against the belly. 14. *The Metronome*. (for two patients) - With thumb and forefinger at the root of the penis guide it, swinging it to and fro from mouth to mouth, one lover being on each side of the irrumator. 15. *The whirlpool* . Swallow the penis whole, and roll the tongue round and round the gland. 16. *Parfait amour*. (Lady T.... has to say that she learnt this from Mlle. Marcelle of the house just off the Carrefour de L'Odeon, a Paris). Swallow the scrotum whole and rub the penis backwards and forwards across the nose. Excite at the same time the testes with the tongue, and the fundament with the finger. DD. Perhaps the 5 refers to the Pentagram. EE. Nonsense, the Angel of the Key of [samekh] is Sandalphon, not Metatron, and is of Reconciliation. Even a Zahid would surely know this. The true key to its meaning is its value 104 = 8 x 13, and therefore its interpretation of the number 8, since 13 is only the basic unity. Now 8 refers to [cheth] the Chariot and Abracadabra. Perhaps the two Sphinxes which the Charioteer drives are the symbols of the two sexes which he enjoys, even as the Sphinx is the Deification of the bestial, and therefore an apt Hieroglyph of the Magnum Opus. FF. One is sorry to have to object that the Arabic Hua is spelt [Persian] not [Persian] and equals 11, not 12. The number 11 however does represent the squaring of the circle, the Great Work, since there are 11 letters in Abrahadabra, whose symbolism is so enigmatical: [Persian] is further the equation of [Persian] 5 the Pentagram and [Persian] 6 the Hexagram, Micro and Macro-prosopus, Man and God.
