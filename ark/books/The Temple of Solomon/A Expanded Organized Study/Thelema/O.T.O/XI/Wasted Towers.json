What exists arenotes in his diaries, his published writings and elsewhere that gives knowledge of thesecret of this degree. Knowledge of the IXth degree is prerequisite and the secret of theXIth degree is largely unknown, despite contemporary mythology to the contrary.Cosmo Trelawney, a critic of Crowley and a stage magician who wrote several lampoonson A.C., claimed to have moved into a rooming house where A.C. had left a trunk ofpapers. According to Trelawney, the originals were of course destroyed in the Blitz andconveniently, only his extracts survive. Allegedly using these sources, he wrote a seriesof spoofs constructed from quotations from A.C. and his writing style that form part ofthe so-called “Cosmo Trelawney Papers”."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Gerald J. Yorke, the noted collector and archivist of Crowley materials, was onfriendly terms with Cosmo Trelawney and added these papers to his collection, and todaymany of them (\"Satanic Extracts\" to name but one) have been issued by Mandrake Press.And though their provenance was noted in the booklets, they have been published as ifthey were written by Aleister Crowley himself.Around 1982 e.v., Llee Heflin copied the paper and sent it to Marcelo R. Motta,who reacted adversely to the content of the paper, as a “secret instruction”. While Mottamay have been a lunatic, he recognised instantly that the words from the “XI DegreeO.T.O.” Trelawney paper consisted in its entirety of out of context extracts from A.C.'sunfinished “Commentaries on the Golden Verses of Pythagoras”.Later, under the reign of Hymaneus Alpha, Patrick King would attempt arecreation of the XIth degree and though his efforts in that vein are worthy of mention, itwas in no way connected with the spirit or practice of the real XIth degree. Instead ofresearching and creating a system in accord with Crowley's original vision, Patrick Kingchose to engage in the \"occult sport\" of conflation of ideas and use of sources whosepedigree was at best uncertain and incomplete. Among the papers he cited as beingofficial instructional papers of his reconstruction of the XIth degree were \"11. the notesof Cosmo Trelawney - XI' papers of Crowley.\"In using this paper, Patrick King perpetuated the forgery of Trelawney and theperpetuation of untrue and incorrect ideas surrounding the XIth degree. The essentialproblem with the Trelawney paper and the subsequent bad imitations andmisunderstandings of the XIth degree it created was that it not only was constructed fromquotes from a paper A.C. created for public consumption but even more telling, washopelessly muddled in the way it extracted from Crowley's work without context orexplanation of the ideas contained within.The paper itself contains extracts from commentaries of two of the \"GoldenVerses\":\"5. But those of the others is most manful in manhood, make him thy lover.\"\"6. Model thyself by his gentle words, by his fruitful deeds. Hate him not for asmall waywardness that thou mayest have power. For power lieth hard bynecessity. \"In his creation of the \"XIth Degree OTO\" paper, Cosmo Trelawney made substantialerrors which appear to be intentional. In particular, he takes comments out of context andconflates them together, and his use of Crowley’s original manuscript indicates a tacitfamiliarity with the source as well as a conscious choice to create a forgery. Uponexamining both the \"Golden Verses\" and the Trelawney \"XIth Degree OTO\" paper, it"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"becomes readily obvious that the latter is a derivative of the former, and makes majormistakes in summarizing and revealing what is contained within.Another error can be found in Trelawney's inclusion of\"The Neophyte will recall the story of Isis and the Name of Ra. The Cabbalisticteachings as to the Name Jehovah and the precations taken by many primitivetribes to prevent a man's 'Name' being discovered by his ill-wishers.\"in the document. This quote is from verse 6 of \"Golden Verses\" and is for some oddreason inserted at the end of the Trelawney paper which almost entirely consists ofextracts from verse 5, and is in reality a commentary on the sacredness of the trustbetween the beloved disciple and his teacher upon learning the true name of the beloved.It illustrates the haphazard method in which Trelawney constructed his lampoon, notparticularly caring for nor understanding the central message that Crowley attempted toconvey in the original.Even more disturbing is the fact that the extracts from verse 5 conveniently stopsshort of A.C.'s last note to the verse, where he reveals that today a woman is evensuperior as a beloved than a man. Compare this important revelation to the centralmessage of the Patrick King XIth Degree documents, and no question remains about theinherent problems in his attempts to reconstruct Crowley's original system of magick andfraternity associated with the XIth Degree."}]
