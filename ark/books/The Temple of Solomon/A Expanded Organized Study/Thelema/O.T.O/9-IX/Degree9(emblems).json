XII. Note that the “male child” (p. 95) equals the Serpent.1 The“initiated interpretation” in footnote 42 on that page is nonsense—dust in the eyes ofthe profane. See also Liber Astarte (CLXXV) pp. 390-4043 for hints as to how toacquire the mental state necessary to prepare for the work. Also, for the same reason,Liber A’ash vel Capricorni Pneumatici (CCCLXX) pp. 432-434 and Liber Cheth velVallum Abiegni (CLVI) pp. 430-431. But it all adds up to “inflame thyself inpraying.”4Emblem I: The EggThis is said to be laid by the White Eagle,5 whose number is (in this case, I suppose)156.6 Its vehicle or menstruum is what the Alchemists call the Gluten. It may befertilized by any kind of “Serpent.”7 The hatching and subsequent career will dependon the original energy, the right ordering of the surrounding circumstances, and soon. But you get nothing at all, or something you don't want at all (because the Egg,ill cared for, can collect a poisonous “Serpent” from hostile and malignant elements)unless you are extremely careful to get the “Magical Link” properly formed andguarded. See Magick Cap. XIV pp 106-122.Emblem II: The SerpentThis is the principle of immortality, the self-renewal through incarnation, ofpersistent will, inherent in the “Red Lion” who is, of course, the operator. It is saidto swim in the “Blood of the Red Lion.” The lion must determine what kind ofserpent he needs as a vehicle of the particular Will demanded by the proposedoperation. It must, of course, be a necessary element of his total “True Will”; andotherwise, there would be an eternal conflict between the part and the whole; theoperation would be a failure or worse (e.g. if you did an operation to harm Smith,8 itwould fail and reflect on yourself; because deeper than any personal antagonism, youare sworn brothers in the O.T.O.)"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The properly trained and vitalized serpent is found in the acts of Concentration uponthe Object of the Operation preliminary to starting; that is, to impose the image ofyour particular Will upon the actually existing physical serpents which you possess,eager to reproduce and manifest the image of your Will. Their “natural” Will is ofcourse to continue their “lion” through the “floods”, (i.e. the fertilization of a suitable“egg” will appear as the original Lion modified by that particular Eagle, or as anEagle similarly constituted.) But the technique of the Operation prevents (or shouldprevent) this issue;9 so, as the Will to Create and Transmit cannot be baulked—Lawof the Conservation of Energy—the material bases of the Operation are prepared toproduce the Image of the Will impressed upon them by the preliminary studies andpractices by bringing to pass the Object of the Operation.Conditions of the operationBoth Lion and Eagle must be robust, in good health (as a rule; but a sick lion canoften heal himself); overflowing with energy, magnetically attracted to one another,and in absolute understanding harmony about the object of the operation. (It ispossible, and unfortunately often necessary, to employ an Eagle altogether ignorant ofthe theory, or even what is being done.10 I have found this works perfectly; indeed,when the Eagle is aware, a thousand difficulties crop up. It is horrifyingly rare tofind an Eagle genuinely capable of initiated co-operation. The late O.H.O.11 told mehe had found perfection twice in his whole life! Even so, the result was bad, causingviolent reaction of antipathy. I have been more fortunate.) There should be noworries or distractions; the current of thought should flow freely and forcibly towardsattainment of the object. And then: “Inflame thyself in praying.”The Operation ProperAs the actual work proceeds, the mind-will must be directed more and more intenselytowards the object of the operation. Physical phenomena, obviously with constantlyincreasing insistence, will do their utmost to attract the attention of the operatorsthemselves. It is of absolute necessity for the success of the work that at the lastmoment—which may be prolonged to several minutes!—when the intensity of theconflict between physical stress produces (as it should, of course, when there is noquestion of conscious achievement) a complete “Black-Out,” when the Ego-consciousness itself is abolished—the Will should still continue to create, stoppingonly when “The blood of the Red Lion is one with the Gluten of the White Eagle,”and the Serpent and the Egg have fused completely. The result of this fusion iscalled the Elixir—and numerous other names, for example, the Stone of thePhilosophers, the Medicine of Metals, etc., especially the Quintessence.Perfect simultaneity between the Lion and the Eagle is important. To assist this verydifficult work the use of a mantra, either universal (like A Ka Dua12 or Aum ManiPadme Hum) or suited to the objects of the working, is often valuable. For example,in the Paris Working,13 the verses were composed specifically in invoking Mercury.Jungiter in vati vates: rex inclyte Hermes to venius, verba nefanda ferens. InEnglish: “Behold! the Priest is joined to the Priest: illustriuous king of the Staff(Wand, Caduceus) mayest thou come, Hermes, bearing unutterable14 words!”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"There is one further point. The Lion must be enraged before he can cope with theEagle, and during this process it is quite impossible to think of the ceremony. To doso would be to stop the whole process, whose beginning may be announced by theprayer Accendat in nobis, Dominus ignem sui amoris et flamman aeternae caritatis.(In English: “May the Lord kindle in us the fire of his love and the flame of eternalcharity!” This last word has a special technical meaning. See Magick pp 325-326.15)This sentence is the signal to forget altogether the purpose of the whole operation.But immediately that all things are ready, the apparatus in the proper position, theMantra and the contest between the Creative Will and the physical phenomenashould begin. Success depends largely on the smartness and completeness of thiscontrol.The ElixirThis being duly prepared, it must be administered as follows: The Lion must collect it—the best method is by suction, so as to avoid waste, and share it with the Eagle.16 Itshould be absorbed by the mucous membrane.17 A portion is reserved and placed inphysical contact with the magickal link, or with a talisman specially prepared for theOperation,18 and consecrated accordingly. At the very least, some suitable symbol,e.g. if you are making an opus for money, smear the Elixir on a gold coin, or ring; iffor health, touch the bare earth, or the patient with it. In any case, be careful toconsume it by absorbtion; for it restores with interest any virtue that may have beenexpended in the work itself. The effect of any opus ought to be refreshing; if not,error somewhere.Read Judges,19 Samson's riddle: “What is sweeter than honey, and stronger than aLion?” Here Bees—identical symbolically with the Eagle—swarm in the carcass ofthe lion slain by Samson. But this lion is our Serpent and Samson our Red Lion. Astrange and potent sweetness characterises the Elixir when properly prepared.See also Liber 333 Cap. 36, “The Star Sapphire”; Magick p. 328;20 St. John’s Gospel,Chap. 4:13-16, 31-32; Chap. 6:27 and 48-58; First Corinthians 10:1-4, 16-17, 11:23-30. Also Little Essays Towards Truth pp. 70-74.21 This last is important – this modeof work must never be used except as a sacrament; if you do, all kinds of horridthings can get hold of you through the undetermined, unguarded, wasted menstruum.You must prepare the Quintessence on every occasion. This is the great danger.Hence the universal insistence of all magi upon the virtue which gives its title to this“Little Essay” above mentioned. This should be enough. Some of it sounds hard, butwork on it constantly, and there is no limit to your possible success.

Said to be “from Baphomet’s privatecorrespondence, Anno XXXVIII” (1942 e.v.)]Chapter XII of Magick gives nearly everything. (The note on page 95—the initiatedinterpretation—is of course a blind.)To put the whole thing in a nutshell, you must(a) never perform the physical act without strict magical intention;(b) consecrate and charge the vehicle of the creative Will with the utmost caution and energybefore you start—begin long ahead;(c) prolong the working up to the climax as much as possible—1 to 2 hours is good work, 5hours is about the limit;(d) prolong the moment of loss of consciousness to the utmost;(e) be careful that this is wholly a projection of the Will which you have formulated in yourpreliminary consecration, avoiding above all the slightest physical feeling or emotion;(f) ensure the simultaneous appearance of the receiving and transmitting vehicle, see that thetwo are perfectly combined, and absorb the product through the mucous membrane withoutswallowing; while doing this, let yourself go at imagining the successful working of theOperation and its results. There should be an equal and opposite Eagle to work with yourLion; but this is in my own experience so difficult to find or even to train that I have usuallyhad to keep my own counsel."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"“ABOUT THE IX°”[From a letter from Crowley to Grady McMurtry postmarked 24.11.1944.]Now about the IX°. The theory is simple, and I think I told you enough at 93 [Jermyn Street]for you to work on. Just in case:—Your prepare the Medicine by mixing the two ingredients, with your mind concentrated andexalted on the purpose of the Opus at the moment of mixing. You absorb this, preferably bythe mucus membrane (so as to avoid the gross chemical changes which would ensue if it wereswallowed); and, when a third person or thing is involved, you apply a small portion of it,either directly or by means of a talisman or some such device. In material opus it may be wellto complete the circuit by making contact with earth, e.g. the grass, or a plant, not a floor orany artificial “ground.”The Art of preparing the Elixir is not easy: (a) you must get a copious eagle, and (b) the eggsought to be <fertilized>: (c) the Link must be made secure.

The one thingthat never alters is the basic formula of hwhy.   Notes to Emblems and Mode of UseThis paper appears to have been part of a letter from Crowley to Jack Parsons, probably circa1940 (the reference to Little Essays Towards Truth puts an earliest possible date of 1938 onit). The text of the present edition is compiled from various versions posted on Internetforums, of which the most complete appears to be one originally posted in June 1992 on theThelema echo of Baphonet BBS by someone claiming (probably falsely) to be “B. Breeze.”1:This sentence is missing in most of the copies I have seen (all Internet postings bar one,the copy in ORSM and the German translation in OTOA Reader). But since the nextsentence refers back to it, it cannot have been a later interpolation. This suggests thatmost of the copies of Emblems circulating ultimately derive from a single defectivetranscript. All page citations are for the first edition of Magick in Theory and Practice.The 1994 and 1997 “Blue Brick” editions have these page numbers in the margins.2:Chapter XII of Magick in Theory and Practice is called “Of the Bloody Sacrifice andMatters Cognate.” Crowley is referring to the fourth footnote on page 95 of the originaledition (footnote to the notorious line “A male child of perfect innocence and highintelligence is the most suitable victim” – which was quoted by the prosecution in a recentBritish murder trial) which reads:It appears from the Magical Records of Frater Perdurabo that he made thisparticular sacrifice on an average about 150 times every years between 1912E.V. and 1928 E.V. Contrast J.-K. Huysmans’ Là-Bas, where a perverted formof Magick of an analogous order is described."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"      “‘It is the sacrifice of oneself spiritually. And the intelligence and innocence ofthat male child are the perfect understanding of the Magician, his one aim,without lust of result. And male he must be, because what he sacrifices is notthe material blood, but his creative power.’ This initiated interpretation of thetexts was sent spontaneously by Soror I.W.E., for the sake of the youngerBrethren.Crowley appears to be suggesting that the second paragraph is merely a meaningless blind,rather than a description in symbolic language of the actual “sacrifice” referred to.3:Liber Astarte is an instruction in Bhakti-Yoga or union by devotion to a particular deity;Liber Cheth and Liber A’ash appear to hint in heavily veiled language at some kind ofsexual rite. Commentaries by Crowley and C.S. Jones on A’ash (Liber CCCLXX) werepublished in Equinox IV (1).4:A phrase adopted by Crowley from The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage(Book II, ch. 13). König erroneously states in OTOA-Reader that this is another exampleof Crowley’s habit of quoting himself.5:i.e. the female operator (or assistant). The “Lion”, as Crowley says, refers here to themale operator (the term is used in a slightly different sense in Agape and De Arte Magicawhere the word denotes either the “Blood of the Lion” or the “Serpent” – I am not surewhich – of Emblems), the “Blood of the Red Lion” to the semen and the “Gluten of theWhite Eagle” to the vaginal secretions. The “egg” and “serpent” must refersimultaneously to both the physical ova and sperm, and their equivalent on some otherplane; otherwise the instruction makes no sense. But of course all the symbols havesimultaneous references on multiple planes; this is one reason for using symbols (toclarify: not that one symbol refers to different things at the same time; one symbol refers toone thing, but that one thing exists and operates on multiple planes simultaneously.)6:Possibly a reference to the Babalon Working, if this was indeed addressed to Jack Parsons(156 is the number of Babalon).7:It has been alleged (posting on Internet discussion group AiwazThelema@egroups.com inAugust 2000) that at this point the words “... which is congenial, and the nature of theeaglet will depend upon the Will of the Serpent.” appear in some copies.8:W.T. Smith, then head of Agape Lodge #2 O.T.O. and Crowley’s X° for the USA. He waslater removed by Crowley, in a rather ingenious manner. Crowley claimed that, onstudying Smith’s horoscope, he had learnt that Smith was – potentially at least – anincarnate god. He should therefore immediately stop concerning himself with mundanematters like running a lodge and go on a Magical Retirement to realise his divinity, in themeantime letting Parsons take over the lodge. Crowley wrote a full instruction for Smith(Liber CXXXII vel Apotheosis), an excerpt from which is published in Grant, The MagicalRevival. Smith followed these instructions but to no avail; his last letter to Crowley(quoted in Grant, op cit) was of utter despondency. Smith briefly attempted to proclaimhimself Outer Head of O.T.O. after Crowley’s death (on the basis of Crowley’s 1932 Will,which had since been revoked), but failed to gather any support.9:I.e., prevent conception taking place on the physical plane. Personally, I have grave doubtsabout the efficiency of the O.T.O. IX° as a method of contraception. You can’t be sureyou’ve got every last one of the little bastards out...10:Compare De Arte Magica, chapters X and XII. Frater PVN, in notes to the Mezla editionof Emblems (cited by Kraig, 1998), took the view that this advice, besides being morallyreprehensible, is now largely redundant (whatever validity it may ever have had) as in thisday and age it is far easier to “find an Eagle genuinely capable of initiated co-operation.”"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"      11:Theodor Reuss, who died in 1923. It is by no means certain that Reuss wanted Crowley ashis successor – brutally, we only have Crowley’s word for it. Crowley’s assuming theoffice of O.H.O. was more of the nature of a coup than anything else, done with thesupport (later withdrawn) of C.S. Jones and Heinrich Tränker, and no real activeresistance from the other X° national heads – those who didn’t like Crowley simply wenttheir own way rather than attempt to set up a rival O.H.O. against him.12:One of the verses from the “Stele of Revealing.” In full:A ka duaTuf ur biuBi a’a chefuDudu nur af an nuteru! (n.b.: modern transliterations of Egyptian differ somewhat)Translated by Crowley as:“Unity uttermost showedI adore the might of thy breath!Supreme and terrible GodWho makest the Gods and DeathTo tremble before Thee,I, I adore thee!”A more literal translation (from Equinox III (9)) runs: “Oh high one, may he be praised;the one great of power; the spirit, great of dignity, who places fear of himself among thegods.”13:A series of XI° (homosexual) operations with Neuburg in 1914. See Equinox IV (2).14:Perhaps “forbidden” is a better translation (Crowley’s own note, in the Paris Workingmaterial).15:Refers to the Grimoirum Sanctissimum at the start of Appendix VI. The original versionof this was the Grimoire of the Paris Working.16:“The sacrament should be passed back and forth from mouth to mouth rhythmically andwithout permitting contact with the circumambient air” – Kenneth Grant, Hecate’sFountain (quoted in a footnote in Der OTOA-Reader; in context this remark appears torefer to an entirely different and specific rite, but it may be of more general application).17:I.e., rather than swallowed (Grant, loc cit, also makes this point, in his usual obscureway). This point is not mentioned in any of the other published IX° papers; the idea isprobably that its effect will be reduced or lost if the ‘Elixir’ is broken down in thedigestive system. I have heard it alleged that one of the high-degree O.T.O. signs involvesplacing one hand on the throat to prevent swallowing.18:Crowley used Abramelin letter squares in such operations. A talisman consecrated thisway, “for a great treasure”, came into the possession of Gerald Yorke, who used it withsome success in building up his collection of Crowleyana (now in the collection of theWarburg Institute at the University of London).19:ch xiv, 12-18.20:Also refers to Liber XXXVI.21:Essay titled “Chastity.” Pages 69-73 in the 1996 New Falcon edition. Well worthstudying if only to get a slightly clearer idea of Crowley’s unconventional use of the word."}]
