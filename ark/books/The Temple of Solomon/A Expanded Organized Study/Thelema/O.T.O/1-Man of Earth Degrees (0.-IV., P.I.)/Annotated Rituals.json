[{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"FOREWORD Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. This edition of the revised rituals of Ordo Templi Orientis is the culmination of almost five years of research. Our rituals have long been in need of standardization, with reliable guidelines for new initiators. Regional practices have diverged in many particulars, and many groups have discovered the correct interpretations of many difficult passages — if not the reason, then the rhyme. Accordingly, these rituals have been prepared in consultation with some of the Order’s most experienced initiators. No less than five distinct sets of rituals were drawn on, ranging from the early “masonic” versions, through the various revisions made ca. 1916 EV, including those used in North America, and Australasia. Besides those in the Agape Grand Lodge Archives, the collections of the Warburg Institute in London were consulted. By careful comparison, many bothersome issues of long standing were resolved, and passages that were inexplicably dropped in some versions were restored. This annotated edition is issued to III* initiators. It is being issued in loose-leaf format so that it may be updated from time to time. It is not intended to be used in Temple, but rather as a reference guide for Initiators only. Temple booklets are provided for use in the rituals proper. Certain passages have been written to conform to particular Temple equipment. In all such cases, the proper equipment and supplies are available from the Quartermaster. The words are omitted, although the descriptions of the signs are retained. Should any initiator have the slightest doubt as to the proper formulae, we recommend that they contact their own initiator.

On his tight hand is a seat. The tent is lighted by a single candle or, there is a palm-tree.  1) Baphomet attributed this degree to the element Earth, and to the Muladhara and Ajna chakras. Its traditional attribution to the time of day varies. Some attribute it to midnight, others to the pre-dawn hours. Many initiators perform it at those times. — NEMO 2) If no tent, use a circular pillar. — Baphomet. Saladin should wear a turban and preferably a complete Arabic costume, i.e. a jalaba (Arabic robe) with vest and pantaloons, etc. According to a omet, the sword of Saladin is a curved scimitar. Baphomet also suggests that the ideal setting is a desert, with palm trees, although Agape Lodge used a beach to good effect. Baphomet went so far as to specify that camels be employed (pointing out that horses, and even automobiles, have been used effectively.) This refers to the method of transportation of the candidate to and from the remote Camp site. If the Minerval is performed indoors, oriental rugs and hangings contribute greatly to the atmosphere.— NEMO 3) Some versions of the ritual describe this as “a well covered with a coping-stone.” — NEMO 4) Most initiators find this impractical and use a smaller altar, a single or double cube. The original draft of the Minerval ritual permitted the use of a table. — NEMO 5) Use scroll of the Law. (Use facsimile in Equinox 1(7) facing page 386. It should be rolled up. Do not give it to Candidate, but take it back after the ceremony, referring him to printed copy in Equinox 1(10).) — Baphomet Current practice is to give each Candidate a copy of The Book of the Law to keep. It need not necessarily contain the facsimile of the MS. although that is preferable. — NEMO "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" OPENING 6 Saladin gives one knock  All rise Saladin. Noble Emir, what is your duty in this encampment? Emir. Mighty Saladin, it is to protect our Mysteries against the indiscretions of the profane. S. Have you taken measures to that effect? E. The Sentinels are at their posts and we are in security. S. Since it is so, satisfy yourself that all present are Minerval. E. Brethren, it is the Mighty Saladin’s command that you prove yourselves Minerval. Done. E. Mighty Saladin, the Brethren have proved themselves Minerval. S. That being so, I will thank the Brethren to stand to order whilst I declare this encampment open. Done. Accordingly, in the name of the Secret Master, and under the auspices of the Sovereign Sanctuary, I proclaim this encampment open in the Degree of Minerval for the quest of Peace and Wisdom. The brethren resume their seats.  Noble Emir,7 enquire if there is aught to report. Emir retires and returns with Candidate. 6) Opening for the Minerval was found in the rituals issued to the Australasian O.T.O. It is to be used in opening a Camp of Minerval outside of open Oasis or Lodge. It should also be performed in opening a regular Oasis or Lodge in degree sequence, in which instance it should be performed in the Oasis or Lodge proper, not in an anteroom, unless Minerval initiations are planned that would make use of the anteroom. — NEMO 7) This last section of this Minerval opening is only used if performing Minerval initiations. It is omitted if opening 0º as a prelude to a higher degree.— NEMO"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" PART ONE Without is an armed Black Guard,7 who seizes the Candidate8 on his approach, sudderdy and silently, and binds him hand and foot, and blindfolds9 him.

Repeat your name at length, and say after me: 7) A man in a black robe armed with a sword will do. — Baphomet 8) Minervals should be made in batches, preferably 12 at a time according to the signs of the Zodiac. Each goes through the first part separately, all coming in together for the second part. —Baphomet. In the 1940s EV Baphomet developed further the “Camp of Minerval” working that degree only, preferably out of doors, inititiating in large batches. At the same time, he had Lodges continue in their practice of initiating Minerval and First Degree on the same occasion, with a smaller number of candidates, although the Minerval was often worked out of doors, and the candidate then immediately taken to the Lodge for First Degree. Both practices are now allowable, with the former best employed for starting a new group, the latter for maintaining an existing group. — NEMO 9) Tie hands first, then feet, then blindfold. — NEMO 10) 0r “her” if a woman; and so throughout.

The sign is given by extending the thumb of the right hand, fingers extended, and placing it against the forehead17, as if you beheld far in the desert, a pilgrim approaching the camp. The Penal Sign is given by clenching the fingers of the right hand, the thumb extended, and drawing the thumb smartly across the lower torso18 from your right to your left. The Grip is given by seizing the right thumb of the brother or sister with your right hand and squeezing it twelve times, in four batteries of three.  The Word is ON19 It signifies the Sun in the old Egyptian language. 15) Pronounced \"oh—yay-. — NEMO 16) These people do not appear; they are hidden in another room until after the ceremony. As a rule, one goes straight on from this to the 1°, and this Minerval ceremony should not be in the Lodge but in an antechamber. — Baphomet. This note appears in Baphomet’s first version of the Minerval ritual, and is current recommended practice. One advantage is that the use of two separate adjoining rooms makes moot the question of whether the well is present in the Minerval. It also greatly simplifies Minerval initiations in the field. It is especially recommended when performing same-occasion Minerval and 1º initiations. Also, in a recently discovered memorandum Baphomet recommends separate initiation teams for Minerval and the higher Oasis degrees, although this is not the usual practice now. — NEMO  17) Ajna chakra. — NEMO 18) Muladhara chakra. — NEMO  19) State the word, and after a pause, spell it. — NEMO"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"  For the present, worthy and welcome guest, I see that you are in need of repose.

He may provide them witrh water, coffee, dates and figs in accordance with Oriental custom.

Worthy and valiant guests, I trust that so far you have had no reason to complain of our hospitality. Are you well rested and refreshed? C. I am.21 S. Are you ready to fight by the side of your comrades at the behest of BAPHOMET C. I am. S. Our Grand Master will have none but free men and women in the ranks of his army.

Candidate replies as he thinks fit and Saladin holds an impromptu dialogue with him which ends as follows. S. Noble and valiant guests and comrades! You have arrived among us at a time when freedom is about to deliver the decisive combat against the forces of superstition, tyranny and oppression. In the time which you have spent in reposing from the fatigue of your journey, what was your sustenance and comfort? C. The Book of the Law. S. Can you explain the nature of that law in a few words?

The Black Guard gives the Candidate a chapter to read, and he reads it.22 S. Let all present raise the right hand and say with me: “We swear to defend the principles of the Book of the Law in the name of the freedom of man, in whom is God.” All repeat. Noble and valiant guests, I will venture to acquaint you with the first paradox of philosophy. In order to obtain freedom to do your will, it is necessary to submit voluntarily to discipline and organization. Evolution implies structuralization. The power of man is greater than the power of the amoeba, because he has specialized the functions of the protoplasm of which he is composed. The regulations of our Order are strict, even as the sinews of your arm are firm. Were your sinews loosened, you could no longer move your arm. Chafe not, therefore, at the apparent restrictions which your obligations place upon you. They are designed solely to enable you to do your will. In order that you may do the one thing which you will truly, you must therefore renounce all those other things which may tempt you to swerve from the one purpose of your sojourn amongst us. This tent, under whose canopy I sit, is restrained by the rigidity of its support. It fulfills its design by virtue of this discipline. 22) “The Blackguard gives the Candidate either the first or second chapter to read, and he reads them”— Baphomet. Modern practices concerning these readings vary. Some initiators choose the Chapter; others leave it to the discretion of the Candidate. Some give Ch. ito male and Ch. 2 to female candidates—NEMO"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"I charge you, therefore, to meditate over this paradox, in order that you may understand the necessity to undergo that course of training which will make you efficient as a soldier of freedom. Let me further assure you that the word freedom is with us no idle term. We neither know nor care what your will is. “thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay.” We unreservedly place power in your hands. If it be your will to enter this army as a spy to destroy your comrades, so be it! Yet remember that you have made solemn affirmation to us in these words, which you will again repeat after me: “If I break this oath, and betray the bread and salt, may the dogs devour my carcass;23 may I be mutilated and no more a man.

Some versions exclude the words, “may the dogs devour my carcass” at this point. — NEMO 24) According to oral tradition dating from the early Agape Lodge, O.T.O.. applause consists of clapping the hands three times, then five, then three. — NEMO 25) When the 1° is given on the same occasion as Minerval, the Banquet, however simple, should not be omitted between them. — NEMO "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" BANQUET Saladin at head of table.
