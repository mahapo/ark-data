[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Words and their Import: Being an analysis by Frater ARVN on the Word of the Oasis Degrees from Minerval to Master Magician. Degree: Minerval Word:  ON Import: The Sun in the Old Ægyptian Language Hebrew: Ayin Nun Value: 120 Full Value: 236 ATUs of Tahuti: The Devil, Death (XV, XIII) ATU Value: 28 Interesting notes: The number of this word, 120, is also the number of Samekh spelled in full. It is also the product of the first five natural numbers and is the sum of the first fifteen natural numbers. By cursory analysis, the number implies the One becoming Two who unite in Naught. This is the formula of the IXo of OTO. The meaning of the Hebrew letters Ayin and Nun are \"An Eye\" and \"A Fish.\" The Fish in the Piscean age was equated with the Man-God whose image was synthesized in Christ. Thus, the word links the Sun to the Eye of God. Also, the Lamen of OTO is in the shape of a \"Vesica Piscis\" or \"Fish Bladder.\" The same also contains an Eye. By AThBSh Temurah, the letters of the decomposition become Zain and Teth respectively. These letters translate to \"A Sword\" and \"A Serpent.\" Hence, the word is a Glyph of the Tree of Life. 28 is the product of 4 and 7, implying the union of the Elements with the Planets. This is VITAL to initiation as it indicates the manipulation and purification of the subjective (the elements, 4) by the objective or external (the planets, 7.) Hence, what is within affects what is without and what is without affects what is within. 236 is the product of 4 and 59. 4, again is the elements, while 59 is the number of NDH meaning \"Menstruata.\" This is a secret of sex magick. Degree: First (Man and Brother) Word:  JA Import: The Lord Hebrew: Yud Aleph Value: 11 Full Value: 131 ATUs of Tahuti: The Hermit, The Fool (IX, 0) ATU value: 9"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Interesting notes: JA is a name of the Hebrew God also called Jehovah or Adonai. By cursory analysis, the two units appear to be the two columns of Boaz and Jachin. They also represent the two which emerged from the One. \"JA\" is also short for \"Jachin.\" The meaning of the Hebrew letter \"Yod\" is \"A Hand.\" The meaning of the Hebrew letter \"Aleph\" is \"An ox.\" The first is the means of attaining control over the latter. Thus, the word indicates the power of man to control nature. By AIQ BKR, Yod = Alep = 1 = 10 = 100. 100 = \"Qoph\" meaning \"The Back of the Head\" and is ascribed to the ATU called \"The Moon\" and is, hence, Lunar. This ATU is also ascribed to the sign of Pisces, placing this degree in the direct line of the Piscean Current. (Compare the Letter Resh which means \"A Head\" and note that it is Solar in nature.) The full value of 131 is the number of PAN. It is also the number of MKVSH which is a title of Kether. This links PAN to JA and both to Kether which is the source of All. The total ATU value is 9 which is ascribed to Yesode, being the Moon. It is in this degree that the Candidate undertakes his \"Travels with the Moon.\" 11 is the number of AUD, being the Volcanic Fire of the Magick of Light. It is also a number pertaining to Gold and circular motions. The worthy initiate will understand the meaning of these symbols at once. Degree: Second (Magician) Word:  BO Import: The Lord Hebrew: Beth Ayin Value: 72 Full Value: 542 ATUs of Tahuti: The Magus, The Devil (I, XV) ATU value: 16 Interesting notes: BO is short for \"Boaz\" which is one of the pillars of Solomon's temple. It is also the word OB spelled backwards, which word is a secret name of the World of Atziluth. 72 is the number of Names in the Shemhamphorash. This implies a link between the word and external world represented by the wheel of the Zodiac. It is also twice the number 36 implying a dual solar power and here we must digress: In the OTO degrees, masculine titles ONLY should be conveyed in the Lower Degrees. The reason for this is simple: The Candidate (even if female) is being addressed as male to bestow upon her the rights of a male in the time and place of the initiation. Considering the era in which Saladin lived and the chauvinism that dominated the world, we can clearly see the benefit of bestowing upon a woman the title of \"Man and Brother.\" It is not that it elevates a woman to the status of a man, as both are truly equal beings and equally deserving of rights and respect, but it conveys to the outer and prejudiced world our acknowledgement of the rights of women. The Sun is often depicted as a masculine entity while the Moon is seen as feminine. The Moon's"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"light is but the reflected light of the Sun and in the Æon of the Slave Gods, women were seen as being \"reflections\" or \"shadows\" of men. Ergo, women were regarded as being soulless and without the divine spark of the Sun. Here, in the Second Degree, the number 72, being a dual solar number indicates the fact that women DO possess a soul and are givers and sustainers of life like the Sun. It is in this degree that the external title of the First is internalized and both sexes are treated as equal. This is in keeping with the Balanced Nature of the Degree. The ATUs of The Devil and the Magician indicate Baphomet and His Vehicle. In legend, the Magician made a Pact with the Devil to obtain his powers. In reality, this Myth indicates the possession of the Magician by PAN or Baphomet (i.e. filled with the Divine Power of Nature) which allows him to Work his Will. Beth + Ayin implies \"The House of the Eye\" which would indicate the Head, being Resh, which is understood as being the Sun. We now begin to move from the Piscean Current into the Current of the New Aeon represented by the Solar-Phallic Deity Ra-Hoor-Khuit whose emblem appears upon the outer garb of the initiate of this degree. 16 is 42 or 4 x 4 which would seem to indicate the Elements of the Elements. This is a key to Enochian Magick when the tablets and their subdivisions are considered. It also pertains to several Hebrew words which mean, \"Exalted,\" \"Lust,\" \"War,\" and \"Equality.\" Here we see again indications of both the balanced nature of the Degree and the Presence of Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Degree: Third (Master Magician) Word:  MABN Import: Now the Blessing of Death is At Hand. Hebrew: Mem Aleph Beth Nun Value:  93 Full Value: 719 ATUs of Tahuti: The Hanged Man, The Fool, The Magician, Death (XII, 0, I, XIII) ATU value: 26 Interesting notes: (These are left as exercises to the ingenium of the Initiate.)"}]
