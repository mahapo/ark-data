It is made so as to hold water; and on this floats an Ark, preferably proportioned as is given in The Canon,3 containing a Dagger, a Disk, and The Book of the Law. In the East is an Altar, cylindrical, where burns a Candle. This is overshadowed y a conical Tent, where is a throne composed of four cubes, arranged as an inverted Tau, for the three officers. These are Saladin, his Wazir, and an Emir. The Wazir sits on the right hand.4   1) Baphomet attributed this degree to the element Fire, and to the Svadisthana chakra.

I now entrust you with the Secrets of this Degree. Advance to me as a Magician. Done. You will now take a third step as before, with the left foot; for the Three represents the return of the Two to the One, but after another manner. And herein lieth a great Mystery, beyond the understanding even of Master Magician. It is in this position that the Secrets of this Degree are communicated. They consist of a Sign, a Grip, and a Word. As in the First Degree, the sign was single, in the Second double, so in the Third Degree it is triple. First is the Sign of Mystery. Clenching the fingers of the right hand, touch with the thumb the forehead, the right breast, the left breast, and finally the throat. This is in commemoration of the wounds of the Ancient Master, and by their position they form a triangle with a point in the focus thereof, which is called CENTRUM IN TRIGONO CENTRI.49 Second is the Sign of Resurrection. Clenching the right hand as usual, touch the navel with the thumb. Then draw the hand sharply across the body, and drop it smartly to the side; then bring it upwards with a curving motion, slowly, to the navel. This sign demands a word; and this word is AN’ EL HAQQ The other replies: I am the Truth, and in my Turban is wrapped nothing but God. Third is the Sign of Brotherhood; which includes the Grip. This is given by approaching with clenched hands, backs of hands upwards, and then reciprocally grasping the thumbs. Three distinct pressures are then given. 49) Note that Latin pronunciation of C is hard, as in English K. — NEMO "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" The first says: I give my hand in sure relation The second answers: As of True Brother with True Brother. Approach the feet, so that the right foot of each is between the two feet of the other. The first says: I pledge my foot for firm foundation. The second answers: Of our straight walking with each other. Touch the right knees and say together: My knee bends not in supplication Either to you or to another. Advancing the lower part of the torso, the first says: My body doth not do you wrong. The second, advancing the breast, replies: My bosom keeps your secrets close. The first, putting his mouth to the other’s ear: My mouth speaks to you, truth in song. The second, putting his mouth to the ear of the first, while both throw the left arm over the back of the other: My arm defends you from your foes. This Sign and Grip, combined, demands a Word. It is the Word by which I raised you, the Word by which we triumph over death. This word is too sacred to utter on any other occasion; and you will therefore say instead of it, a sentence whose initials are formed from the letters of the Word taken in reverse order. This sentence is: NUNC BENEDICTIS ADEST MORTIS which means: now is the blessing of death at hand. I can also indicate it by telling you that the first two of its four letters form the Hebrew word for mother; the next two the Hebrew word for father; and the last two, the Hebrew word for son."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Be seated, Brother Master Magician, in the throne of the Most Mysterious Master of the Secret Place of Masters. Done. W. I am now to impress upon you the Nature of the Bonds which link the Brethren of this Degree. By the union of hands we affirm that the hand given to a Master Magician is a sure pledge of brotherhood, and that it shall never take weapon to assail him. The union of feet is to declare that each shall support his Brother Master Magician, in the Way of his Going. The union of knees, that each shall be self-reliant and independent, not allowing mutual help to destroy mutual self-respect; and affirming that every man and every woman is a star, responsible to itself a one, co-equal and co-eternal with every other God. The union of bodies signifies that the use of the bodily functions shall be such as to bring no grief to any Brother Master Magician, or to them in his household; but rather freedom in rejoicing. The union of breasts implies the unison of hearts of all True Brethren, the love that inspires them, and the sanctity of the confidence between them, The union of mouths affirms that Master Magicians will speak the truth one to another and one of another; while the arm thrown over the back of a brother asserts that each will gnard the other in his absence as in his presence, and defend his honor as if it were his own. In particular he is to be at pains to repel the slanderer of his Brother’s good name, informing that Brother immediately of the name of his slanderer and the matter of the slander and not allowing himself to be tricked into a pledge of secrecy. I ask you, Brother Master Magician, if you clearly understand, and heartily agree with, these principles?"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" C (with Sign 50) I do. E. It now becomes my duty to inform you that the ceremony through which you have just passed, is in every essential the Lesser or Infernal Rite of the Slain God, whose name is John, or some sound similar, as Jonah, Dionysus, Janus, Dianus, Nu, Anu, Oannes, On, Noah, and many others. This God of Water is of the North, because the Sun touches his Northern limit as he enters the watery sign Cancer, and turns towards the South, represented by the Goat-Gods, Set, Satan, Shaitan, Seb, Sebek, Saturn, Abrasax, or Sad, Had, Hades, Adad, Odin, Adonis, Adonal, Atys, etc., who are of the earthy sign Capricornus, the Southern limit of the Sun’s journey. As the end of the summer is in Libra, the cardinal sign of air, the Gods of Water partake also of the airy nature and, similarly, the Earthy Gods have their natures intermixed with fire, since the end of winter announces the fiery sign of Aries, whose mysteries are those of spring and called theG reater Mysteries wherein the Slain God is celebrated by his name lao, Jupiter, Jehovah, Iacchus, Zeus, Shu, Jesus, Osiris, etc. The ignorance of the vulgar and the corruption of the records have aided time’s work of confusing the doctrines, so that the natures of distinct Gods have suffered the accretion of alien elements till their simplicity has almost baffled restoration. The Infernal Rite, of which you are now an initiate, is founded upon the apparent tragedy of the fall of the year, seen as a catastrophe by ignorant minds, tho ugh the philosophical comprehend the phenomenon as a natural, regnlar and recurrent change in the obliquity of the Earth’s Axis. With this ceremony of the renewal of the life of the Sun, is mingled that of what the wise men of old regarded as a similar tragedy, that of the death of man and his renewal “in the son.” Let me ask you to consider, Brother Master Magician, that as the solar tragedy is but the uninformed and partial view of facts, so may the human prove. Of this your progress in our Order may give you opportunity to judge.  50) The Sign of Resurrection. Prompt, if necessary. — NEMO"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" S. I now congratulate you on having obtained the highest dignity in an Oasis of Mysteries. It is, however, my duty to advise you, that before you can be admitted to the highest grade, we shall demand marked and unmistakable p roofs of your fidelity.

Further, you must be exalted through a Lodge of Perfection to the Fourth Degree, and a Council of Princes of Jerusalem, after which the dignity of Knight of the East and West may be conferred upon you. I also give it to you in the strongest terms of recommendation to study the books appointed for your instruction. The Librarian will indicate these to you at the conclusion of the ceremony. Without in any way belittling the three ceremonies through which you have now passed, it is my duty to point out to you that they are but allegories of the life of every man.
