[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Significance of the Ceremony of the Minerval by Aleister Crowley The ceremony of the Minerval, in appearance trivial and formal, contains a doctrine of substantial occult significance. The candidate before his admission is bound by an obligation in which he recognizes Baphomet as the Supreme Authority. This represents the free choice of a free will to submit itself to the magical formula represented by Baphomet. The candidate is seized, blindfolded and bound head and foot. This represents the first operation of this formula. The soul is drawn within the planetary current and its sight and freedom of actions are immediately taken from it. He is described as a native of Corinth, and as having attained the freedom of two cities, Athens and Mitilyne: the initials of these cities KAM gives the Sanskrit word for “work” from which Karma or Kamma is derived. They add also to the number 61, a prime number whose 6 and 1 suggest the hexagram, the symbol of the sun, which is often represented by a six rayed star with a yod in the middle. 61 also represents the word for “nonexistent”, for “towards”, and for “I myself”. Read in conjunction these words explain the formulation of the negative in the ego. 61 also represents the Hebrew word for womb and that for a “little habitation”. There is another and even more important explanation of these words which is however unsuited for members of any grade below the sixth. The Candidate sees that he is traveling to the City of the Sun, which again repeats the solar system and gives the name of another city (Heliopolis). The adding of the “H” raises the number to 66, which is the number of the Great Work, and is the sum of the first eleven numbers. In order to obtain freedom of the planet into whose current he has been drawn, he is obliged to take an oath, and it indicates the first sacrament, that of Earth. He thus obtains freedom to seek for a suitable medium for incarnation, indicated by the words “Be seated on my right hand.” He is presented with a sacred scroll which confirms his freedom. It should have been remarked that the penalty of the oath applies to reproduction or generation. The soul is attempting to perform its work through the vehicle of humanity and if it fails to hold these mysteries sacred and secret, it will lose its power to employ this vehicle for its work. The meaning of the sign and of the word ON have already been explained in the lecture of the fourth degree, but there is a further meaning in these words, which is heartily recommended for your profound study. A strong hit may be given by a study of the number 120. Its character should be written in Arabic (note: the short-hand expert rendered the sentence: “a study of the cultivation? no. 120 which has this (6) serving as Arabic” (T)). It should be noted that Saladin is supposed to be seated in a tent and this tent should be in the shape of a cone, a geometrical figure which combines the straight line with the circle. The new Minerval is informed that he is in need of repose, which refers to a period of contemplation necessary to the beginning of incarnation.

Editor’s note: This piece is apparently from an unpublished diary fragment at the Warburg. As I have not seen the original, I cannot guarantee it to be the work of Aleister Crowley."}]
