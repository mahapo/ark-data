In the East is an Altar, cylind , where burns a Candle. This is overshadowed by a conical Tent, where is a throne composed offour cubes, arranged as an inverted Tau, for the three offtcers. These are Saladin, his Wazir, and an Emir. The Wazir sits at Sal adin’s right hand.5 1) Woman and a Sister” is the necessaiy correlary of “Man and Brother” for female candidates. I consider this to be among the “obvious amendations” that Baphomet suggests is necessary when using a script written for a male candidate in an initiation for a woman. It is arguable that “man” is used in the general sense of “human,” but “brother” is unambigously gender-specific. This need not disturb the I°-III° sequence of Man-Magician-Master Magician if the terms in that specific context are understood as independent of gender. Neither does the calling of female candidates “women” necessarily interfere with the symbolism of the III°, where they are called upon to assume a male role in the drama. - NEMO 2) Baphomet attributed this degree to the element Water, and to the Vishuddha chakra. Its traditional attribution to the time of day is dawn, and many initiators perform it at that time. — NEMO 3) See diagram of the Man of Earth temples, appendix. — NEMO 4) These proportions are 30 long x 5 wide x 3 high. — NEMO. 5) The Oasis may be visualized as the Lamen of the Order, with the Altar considered as the Shining Triangle (4’) and the Well as the Graal (K). The tent as it moves from degree to degree may thus be viewed as the dove descending. It may also be viewed as the Sun in its progress from dawn to dusk. -NEMO"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 OPENING IN MINERVAL6 Saladin gives one knock #. All rise. Saladin.

Man is blind from his birth to his death. Deep in his heart is rooted the ardent desire to see the Light, and to attain its source. So short is life that few succeed.

However, in spite of all the assistance given to mankind, many never do find the Light. Nor do we know whether, even with the help that we can give you, you will succeed. Therefore I pause, and declare: up to now, nothing has been done which would make it impossible for you to withdraw. But if you still persist, then nothing will ever enable you to sever the ties which you are now about to form with us and our Order.

Before the beginning of years,  There came to the making of man Time, with a gift of tears; Grief, with a glass that ran; Pleasure, with pain for leaven; Summer, with flowers that fell; Remembrance fallen from heaven, And madness risen from hell; Strength without hands to smite; Love that endures for a breath; Night, the shadow of light, And life, the shadow of death. And the high gods took in hand Fire, and the falling of tears, And a measure ~of sliding sand From under the feet of the years; And froth and drift of the sea; And dust of the laboring earth; And bodies of things to be In the houses of death and of birth; And wrought with weeping and laughter, And fashioned with loathing and love. With life before and after And death beneath and above 22 The wording of this is ambiguous as to whether the Candidate is in the well when the poem is read or not. Often in the early rituals, staging instructions are given well in advance of the dialogue they correlate to, rather than in a strict sequence. Agape Lodge had the Candidate in the well during the reading, as is attested by W.T. Smith’s note to this passage that reads “This before chorus from Swinbume.” Also, W.T. Smith was trained in the rituals during Baphomet’s Grand Mastership This is appropriate since the poem describes the formation of the “child”, and is my preference.

It has been decided that there is insufficient basis or precedent for inferring the “symbolic” interpretation. Taking the rituals I°-III° as a whole, the actual intent becomes obvious. The I° has three passages like this, totalling 21 years. The II° has three parallel passages, totalling 21 years, and additionally four circambulations of seven for each of the elemental prayers, totalling 28. Thus 21 + 21+ 28 = 70.
