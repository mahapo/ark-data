It is made so as to hold water; and on this floats an Ark, preferably proportioned as is given in The Canon,3 containing a Dagger, a Disk, and The Book of the Law. In the East is an Altar, cylindrical,where burns a Candle. This is overshadowed by a conical Tent, where is a throne composed of four cubes, arranged as an inverted Tau, for the three officers. These are Saladin, his Wazir, and an Emir. The Wazir sits on the right hand.4   1) Baphomet attributed this degree to the element Air, and to the Anahata chakra. Its traditional attribution to the time of day is noon, and many initiators perform it at that time. — NEMO 2) See diagram of the Man of Earth temples, appendix.

I now proceed to instruct you in the Secrets of this degree. Advance to me as at your Lustration. Done. You will now take a second step as before, but with the other foot; it is in this position that the Secrets of the Degree are communicated. They consist of a Sign, a Grip, and a Word. The Sign is twofold. The first part is called the Sign of Life, or of Manifestation. It is given by clenching the fingers of both hands, thumb extended, the right hand to be held with the upper arm forming a square with the shoulder, and the forearm vertical; the left hand is placed at the base of the torso. This is the characteristic position of the principal Gods of Egypt. The second part is called the Sign of Death, and is given by dropping the left hand to the side, and with the other, giving the motion of stabbing the heart. It alludes to the penalty of your obligation. The Grip is given as before, but by offering the thumb and with six pressures only. This Grip demands a Word. This Word is BO,36 which means The Lord. As in the Minerval Degree, it is an universal name or title of the Most High. 34) Each circle of course represents a “year”, for a totalof 28 circles. It is possibly significant that 28 is the length of a lunar month, thus plausibly aligning the solar and lunar within the quatemary of the elements. Also, seven times around the well allows the right amount of time for the proper reading of a single prayer. — NEMO 35) Either Saladin, or a very experienced magician, should read these invocations; a good reading voice is not sufficient for the desired magical effect.
