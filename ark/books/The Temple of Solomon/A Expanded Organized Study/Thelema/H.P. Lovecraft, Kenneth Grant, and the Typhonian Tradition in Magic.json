The Lord of the Shadow Realm, whose very existence has beenhysterically lambasted as an evil aberration, who has been conceived as blasphemousand terrifying since people first sat around campfires near the openings to their caves,whose devotees have ever been feared and hunted. The Enemy, the Other, theAdversary, He who inhabits the undiscovered territory which must be charted andmapped by any who wish to consider themselves worthy explorers of the psyche.Lovecraft has warned us against these dark mysteries in the most dramatic terms.Crowley assumed the mask of the Beast 666 to frighten away the shy, the reticent, thecowardly. Kenneth Grant celebrated this archetype in an almost frenzied literaryoeuvre that straddles the lines between scholarly discourse, imaginative fiction, andpoetic invocation.In The Dark Lord, Peter Levenda, has, once again, applied his considerable eruditionand creative mind and pen to the unity of various streams of consciousness. Describingwhat he calls “the tip of an eldritch iceberg,” Levenda posits a mystic alliance betweenthe thematic content of the fiction of H. P.

Scientific Illuminism hasproven to be a perfect paradigm for our modern world, in which images andinformation travel with the speed of the electron, and the established religions havebecome increasingly irrelevant.The dimensions explored by Lovecraft's fevered imagination continue to haunt andresonate in popular culture nearly a century later. Lovecraft's words and phantasms area staple of derivative modern fiction, graphic novels, art, film, and music. Theextraordinary popularity of Simon's Necronomicon (over one million copies in printsince 1977!) is a case in point. The talented painter H. R. Geiger has broughtLovecraft's terrifying visions to life in his own artistic Necronomicon. The brilliantAustralian artist Rosaleen Norton, whose compelling painting of the Dark Lord isfeatured on the jacket of this book, was another adept of the Darkly Splendid Worlds.Kenneth Grant, the British writer and occultist, shared Levenda's fascination withboth Crowley and Lovecraft. Grant is celebrated the world over for his biographies ofAleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare—who each served as teachers and guides tothe young magician. Yet it is Grant's writing on the Typhonian Gnosis that capturesLevenda's attention in these pages. Grant's embrace of the hidden byways of imageryand symbolism, and the obscure and antinomian practices of widely divergent peoplesthe world over, evoke the darker dimensions of the shadow-self of humankind.Levenda conducts a veritable symphony with strains of religious and esotericknowledge as he explores the roots of the beliefs and doctrines Crowley utilized todevelop his system of Thelema. The reader may expect to be introduced to Yoga andBuddhism, Tantra and Gnosticism, Kabbalah, Alchemy, and Egyptology,Confucianism, Daoism, and Afro-Caribbean magic, as well as the more-familiarJudaism, Christianity, and Islam. You will walk through ancient Sumerian temples ofthe third millennium BCE, participate in the magical circles of the nineteenth centuryGolden Dawn, and witness contemporary rites of the Typhonian Order. You will learndetails about the shadow side of myth that never quite made it into your copy ofLarousse or Bullfinch. Nor is Levenda's discussion of Tantra what your motherunderstood as the ritual of the “five M's.”This book will be of interest to people across a variety of disciplines. Fans ofLovecraft will find his worldview explored in ways that may shock or frighten. Theywill learn that Lovecraft's fearful fantasies may have a greater connection to realitythan they might have hoped. Certainly, readers of Kenneth Grant will be delighted tohave the mysteries of his writings made more clear by Levenda's penetratingexplication and high regard for Grant. One can imagine Grant himself smiling withsatisfaction in the Field of Reeds as he reviews Levenda's analysis of the complexideas he worked so hard to communicate during his lifetime. Students of Crowley arein for a whirlwind ride of speculation, insight, historical, mythic, and spiritualassociations that will enlighten and entertain, as they may also stimulate intense"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"disagreement. (Since Levenda discusses The Book of the Law quite openly, those withthe strongest objections are free to identify him as a “centre of pestilence” and therebyrecover their serenity.) In my opinion, there is more here for Thelemites to learn thanto reject.Peter Levenda and I have known each other for so long our hair was jet black whenwe met. Larry Barnes, the publisher of the Necronomicon, introduced me to Simon, thebook's translator and editor, in 1977. Larry proposed that I design and produce thebook for Schlangekraft/Barnes Graphics. This would become my first project in Studio31. Simon introduced me to Peter, who acted as his literary agent and productioneditor: proofreading various iterations of the typography and dealing with the ever-frenetic Larry. Yes, Simon meticulously scrutinized the seals we had commissioned tobe redrawn for publication based on his original and precise felt-tip pen renderings.Simon also paid particular attention to proofing the language of the spells themselves.But Peter handled the bread and butter day-to-day progress of the book. This was wellbefore the days of personal computers so Simon's manuscript needed to be totallyretyped by the typesetters, a process offering limitless possibilities for errors. We wereall very busy indeed.Unlike Peter, I am a member of what he refers to as the “Caliphate” O.T.O. (I call it“the O.T.O.”) To be fair to the storm of critics who may question my presence in thesepages, let me begin by saying that Peter is my friend. Furthermore, he is one of the bestresearchers into the world's religions on the literary scene today. His Stairway toHeaven and Tantric Temples are two of my favorites of his books. His quest for humandignity forced him to also look into some of the darkest political conspiracies of ourtime, such as those recorded in Ratline, his recently-published history of the Naziescape routes following Germany's defeat in World War II. I am thus honored to play asmall part in The Dark Lord, despite the fact that Peter and I may part company on anumber of important issues.However, when a religion or creed is successful, it opens itself to a broader exposureand discussion in the wider culture. Certain forms of doctrinal exegesis may, ofnecessity, be confined to those who identify themselves most closely with the specificwritings and magical system under discussion. But aspects of the system will maketheir appearance in literature, music, art, and philosophy in an “unsupervised” manner.While some will undoubtedly reject excursions by those outside the confines ofestablished orthodoxy, such thinking may well herald the death of innovation and theestablishment of dogmatic rigidity.One conclusion that is inescapable here is that the author brings much intelligenceto his subject. He shares his vast scholarship of the religious traditions of all times andplaces in his exploration of the congruence of the archetype vibrated and celebrated byAleister Crowley, popularized and feared by Howard Phillips Lovecraft, andresearched and embraced by Kenneth Grant.

P. Lovecraft, considered by many to be the father of the moderngothic horror story. And this early attempt at writing supernatural fiction was entitled“The Beast in the Cave.”As we know, Crowley called himself the Beast, and identified with the Beast in theBook of Revelation. In Lovecraft's story—written when he was only fourteen years old—the Beast is at first thought to be some sort of monster living in the bowels of theearth but is instead revealed to be a human being—a man.As Lovecraft's stories often involve dream communications and the transmission ofinformation by psychic means or through the visions of artists and other sensitivesouls, could it be possible that Lovecraft—an artist himself, of course, as a writer ofimaginative fiction—“picked up” the events of Cairo that were taking place at the verysame time he was composing and writing his story about a Beast who was really aman? As outlandish as this suggestion may seem, it is reinforced by further evidence inLovecraft's own stories, as we shall see. But before we dive into the strange andotherworldly material of Lovecraft, Crowley, and the British occultist Kenneth Grant,we should set the stage for what is to follow.There are two sides to existence, to life itself. There is a bright side, where we live andwork every day; and there is a dark side, what Kenneth Grant calls the “nightside” ofthe Kabbalistic Tree of Life.Spies know this. Criminals and the police who fight them know this. Sexualpredators know this. Serial killers know this. Business people know this. Politiciansknow this.And occultists know this.Everyone who has a secret they desperately want kept secret knows this."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"There is a dark side to everything from politics to religion. And it is in the dark sidethat the most tangible, the most basic elements of life can be found. The primamateria. The fons et origo. One cannot truly know life without knowing the dark side,without peering into its depths, for it is in the dark side that seeds are planted, thatsustenance is taken, that dreams are born and take root in the damp recesses of thesunken cellar of the human soul: the cave wherein the Beast resides, the Beast that is—as Lovecraft tells us—a Man.In average human beings, this dark side is to be found in their unconscious minds,unrecognized and unacknowledged without extensive depth analysis (the term “depth”is instructive); but its impulse can be sensed in their darkest conscious desires, theones they keep secret from society at large and from their closest loved ones. It is notonly sexuality, although sex can be the doorway to knowing the dark side. Freud knewthis. Wilhelm Reich knew this. Jung knew this and trembled at its power. Kabbalistsknew this, and called it the Sitra Ahra, the realm of the damaged gods they called theqlippoth. The Tantrikas know this. And Kenneth Grant knew this.In our lives today we have been ceding the territory of our unconscious little bylittle: to reality television, to social networking sites, to CCTV cameras on every streetcorner, to our credit card transactions, to vulgarity in cinema and entertainmentgenerally, to even casual use of the Internet. Electronic databases may know moreabout our lives and our desires than we can remember ourselves. Profiles can beestablished that delineate our personalities and plumb the depths of our unconscioususing clever algorithms that manipulate the electronic trails we leave behind in ourpassage through cyberspace—like electromagnetic snails on silicon glass. In thisenvironment it becomes harder and harder to function secretly, either as members ofsecret societies or as individuals. (Are there any true secret societies left; any societythat has the maturity to avoid broadcasting itself on the Internet?) Our inner lives arein danger of being ripped open, a process that began in the 1950s when some G-scaledoctors and imbecilic psychiatrists pried open the black box of consciousness likesorcerers's apprentices in a Grade-B horror film.Perhaps it began even earlier, at the dawn of the twentieth century, in a smallapartment in Cairo where an English couple were spending their honeymoon cruisingthe Nile, visiting museums, and talking to gods.This is a dark science, this occultism of the nightside. The word “occult” means“secret,” “hidden,” “dark.” There is no occultism without darkness. There is noreligion without darkness, either, but that is one of the secrets that religion keeps toitself. Religions are of the daylight, of the Sun, of society and community, of publicrituals and private anxieties. But any religion that speaks only of the Sun and its Lightis lying: to others and to itself.For religion is nothing more than the refuge of failed magicians."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"We erect edifices of ritual and dogma against the darkness and call it faith, call itreligion. But the most useful element of any religion is its ability to exorcise demons.It is a practical ability, one with observable and measureable results. Everything else,all sacraments, depend on faith and the suspension of disbelief: penance, baptism, HolyOrders, Extreme Unction, matrimony, even Holy Communion. But a possessed personis a fact, and the successful exorcism of the demon is another fact. Many otherwiselukewarm individuals have been brought to the faith after having witnessed demonicpossession. It is a great recruiting tool for the Church, if nothing else. Sacraments maybind one to the community, reinforce the bonds between the individual and the group.They are rituals of identity. But exorcism ... well, that's another story. Exorcism is nota sacrament. It's a tool, something useful, something with an easily definable mission.It is the place within religion where true magic lies, as if in wait. It is the essentialcontradiction in religion, this axis of possession and exorcism, of cause and effect. It isthe strongest connection in religion to ancient knowledge of the dark side of humanexperience. It reveals what religion wants kept hidden. Secret. Occult.Thelema calls itself a new religion, and at the heart of this new religion is the verydarkness of which we speak. There is a general desire among some believers torepresent Thelema as a religion of the Sun, of the ancient Egyptian deities Osiris, Isisand Horus, of Thoth and Sekhmet.But it is not.As we shall see, the very creed of the Gnostic Mass—the ritual designed to be thepublic face of Thelema to the world—speaks of a god called Chaos.

And this is the Covenant.”—Kenneth Grant, Outer Gateways, p. 14The above correspondences link irrefragibly the Necronomicon, Kamite, andThelemic currents, showing the three strands as a continual linear development,in both a chronological and a magical sense.—Kenneth Grant, Outer Gateways, p. 92In the above two citations from the work of Kenneth Grant we are faced with a bold—if outlandish—concept.Grant—the late head of the Typhonian Order in England and an intimate of Aleister"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Crowley—has insisted throughout many books that the magical current represented byCrowley's Thelema and that represented specifically by the “Schlangekraft recension”of the Necronomicon (sometimes referred to as the “Simonomicon”) are not onlycompatible but in fact are identical. He refers to the Necronomicon Gnosis—a systemrepresentative of not only the Necronomicon itself but also of the stories that fall underthe heading of the “Cthulhu Mythos” and which include works by H.P. Lovecraft aswell as by his friends and imitators—as a credible magical doctrine and practice. Hemakes numerous references to Lovecraft, Cthulhu, and the Necronomicon throughouthis later works in order to substantiate and justify his position on themes as disparateas the magical methods of Austin Osman Spare, the UFO phenomenon, the visions ofCrowley, Jack Parsons, and Charles Stansfeld Jones (Frater Achad), Afro-Caribbeancults, Tantric rituals, and much, much more.What does all this mean?Thelema is a Greek word meaning “will” and was used by Crowley to refer to his newreligion, one developed through the practice of magic (or “magick” as he preferred tospell the word in order to differentiate it from other forms), and established upon theconcept that the world is entering a major new phase of spiritual evolution, a phase hecalled the Aeon of Horus. The previous age was the Aeon of Osiris: the slain andresurrected god that prefigured that of Mithra and of Jesus, among others. The agebefore that was the matriarchal Aeon of Isis. The present Aeon of Horus is to be theage of the Child: the offspring of Isis and Osiris, and thus a Magickal Child.The seminal text of this new religion is the Book of the Law—or Liber AL vel Legisto give it its Latin title—received by Crowley in a series of communications obtainedin Cairo, Egypt in April of 1904. In order to promulgate his new faith, Crowleyenlisted the aid of a German secret society called the Ordo Templi Orientis or Order ofthe Eastern Temple. This Order exists today in several forms and on virtually everycontinent. It is comprised of a series of degrees of initiation, and its members arecalled Thelemites, or followers of Thelema. The Order rituals are based on the ideathat the Knights Templar of the Crusader era formed a kind of alliance with a Muslimsecret society from which they obtained initiations. Indeed, today the Islamic influenceis felt not only in some of the Order rituals but also in the fact that the American-basedversion of the Order often is referred to as the “Caliphate”—a word that is used inIslam to describe the legitimate successors to the Prophet Muhammad.This is not so strange as it may appear. The theme of European mystics going to theMiddle East to obtain secret knowledge is an old one and can be seen in the originlegend of the Rosicrucians (Christian Rosenkreutz, their putative founder, went to theMiddle East in search of wisdom). The German founders of the Ordo Templi Orientisitself also claimed to have visited Muslim lands where they obtained secret initiations.It has been shown by historians that Helena Blavatsky herself—the founder of the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Theosophical Society—had links to the Brotherhood of Luxor, an Egyptian-basedsecret society. Thus, this is a tradition among European occultists that has a longpedigree.The Necronomicon—the grimoire or magician's workbook to which Kenneth Grantrefers in his writings—also has a Middle Eastern pedigree. According to the storiescreated by gothic horror author H. P. Lovecraft, the book was written by a “Mad Arab”in the eighth century CE. It contains themes and invocations that are the heirs of aSumerian tradition: the same tradition that Crowley claimed to be rediscovering in hisown magical development. Indeed, the English translation of the Necronomicon isdedicated to Crowley himself.Thus of the two basic texts to which Kenneth Grant refers in his books onThelema—The Book of the Law, and the Necronomicon—the first was received inEgypt, and the second has its origins in Mesopotamia.The Middle East is the birthplace of the three great monotheistic religions: Judaism,Christianity and Islam—sometimes called the Abrahamic religions after their commonancestor, the prophet Abraham. But is also where some of the world's oldest recordedreligions were born, millenia before the birth of Moses, the founder of the Jewish faith:the Egyptian religion with its plethora of gods and goddesses ... the religions of Sumerand Akkad and Babylon ... and of some even stranger cults, as we shall see.This insistence on ancient origins is a key factor in reading Grant. In fact, Grant isnot satisfied with the antiquity of even these religions but points to an older, moredistant, set of ancestors. Even ancient Egypt—the “Kamite” of the second quotationgiven earlier, is not old enough. The oldest—in Grant's chronology—is that of theNecronomicon and of its associated Sumerian Tradition. To Grant (as well as toCrowley) the tradition that is represented by Thelema had its origins in Sumer, andfrom Sumer to Egypt, and from there to Aleister Crowley's stunning communicationswith an alien intelligence in Cairo in 1904.There is another element to Grant's thesis that is difficult to overlook, and that is theimportance he places on sexuality as a method to be employed for the evocation ofthese dark powers and as a means of entering the mysterious realm he calls the “MauveZone.” His liberal use of Tantric terms and concepts is a hallmark of Grant's work, andhis intimations that unorthodox forms of sexual congress be employed towardsmagical ends is a theme that runs through his books. There has been much nonsensewritten about “sex magic” in the literature of the New Age; Grant's specificdescriptions of the complex psycho-sexual processes involved should make it clearthat “sex magic” does not mean normal coitus performed while meditating or burningscented candles. The fact that the Ordo Templi Orientis itself is considered to be arepository of this type of information should make one aware that a more sophisticatedif not more strenuous approach to the use of sexuality in ritual is required.That said, Kenneth Grant has been criticized by occultists and members of various"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Orders for a number of reasons. In the first place, he once claimed to be the head of theOrdo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) upon the death of previous chief (actually the Order'streasurer) Karl Germer. This was hotly contested by the American (Grady McMurtry)branch of the Order known as the “Caliphate.” In the end, Grant decided that the titlewasn't worth the fight although many of his fans considered him to have been therightful heir to the throne. Instead, he founded what he called the Typhonian Order: amagical group more in line with the discoveries he and his followers were making andwhich was based on the identification of Typhon2—the Dark Lord—as the operativePower of what he termed the “Mauve Zone” on the hidden side of the Kabbalistic Treeof Life and the place from whence all true magical power originates.In the second place, Grant was in many ways his own worst enemy when it came toexplaining his doctrines. His works are impossible to understand unless one has a deepgrounding in Kabbalah, Asian religions, Afro-Caribbean religions, Egyptology, and therituals and grade structures of the Golden Dawn, the Ordo Templi Orientis, and theArgentum Astrum ... to name just a few. His gematria—the system of Kabbalisticanalysis that uses numerological equivalents for Hebrew (and Greek) letters—is off thecharts, and so internally inconsistent that it seems more like stream of consciousnessthan it does numerical or numerological evidence. To read Grant is to become awarethat he is not communicating in a linear, methodical fashion but after the style of aJames Joyce: magic as art, art as magic.Nevertheless, there is buried in the heavy text of Grant's hypothesis a profound andpassionate belief in what he is saying and what he has discovered. And rightly so: for ifwhat Grant says is in any way “true,” our entire perspective on human history will haveto be reconsidered from a terrifying vantage point.For what Grant is saying is that all religions and especially all antinomian cultshave their origin in a single cult, a single magical order, that has its origin not onearth but in the stars.It is this belief—this discovery—that finds itself in line with the most cynical ofLovecraft's horror stories concerning a race of alien beings that once colonized ourplanet and which will come again to reclaim it, a race whose religion is the mother ofall cults.And it is this belief—this doctrine—that finds itself hidden within many of the mostimportant texts of Aleister Crowley's Thelema.It is at the heart of the current fascination with “ancient aliens” and “alienarchaeology” and all those Discovery Channel and History Channel specials about thetheories of von Danniken and Zecharia Sitchin, for example. It is central to fears aboutthe coming of the Antichrist, the prophecies of Nostradamus, and the chiliastic panicabout the Mayan calendar and the end of the year 2012.Other ugly reports concerned my intimacy with leaders of occultist groups, and"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"scholars suspected of connection with nameless bands of abhorrent elder worldhierophants. These rumors, though never proved at the time, were doubtlessstimulated by the known tenor of some of my reading ...3The purpose of this book is to deconstruct and decode the works of Kenneth Grant asmuch as possible, at least insofar as the Necronomicon Gnosis and the TyphonianCurrent are concerned. To do justice to the entire Grant ouevre would be a major taskoutside the scope of this work. What we will do instead is try to understand how theNecronomicon Gnosis fits in with the Thelemic Current, and how both of thesetogether inform Grant's Typhonian hypothesis.Before we begin, however, it is necessary to address three important points:In the first place, the author is not a member of the OTO or, indeed, of any magicalorder or group and never has been. His previous membership in various churches of the“wandering bishop” classification is public knowledge, including at least one churchthat gave apostolic succession to the Gnostic Catholic Church: an auxiliary branch ofthe OTO. But that is as far as the association goes. Therefore nothing the author writesabout here is to be considered official OTO doctrine nor does it have the blessing, nihilobstat, or imprimatur of that or any Order.In the second place, there has been much drama over the Simon Necronomicon,most of which concerns the identity of Simon himself rather than the substance of thebook. Simon has addressed these issues in his own Dead Names: The Dark History ofthe Necronomicon, and I have addressed them in various interviews over the years. Onemay or may not believe in the “reality” of the Necronomicon; what is germane to thisbook is the fact that Kenneth Grant—an occultist, occult author, and occult leader ofno small importance—found the book essential reading and took it very, very seriouslyindeed.In the third and final place, many of the issues we will discuss will be consideredanathema or heretical by doctrinaire Thelemites—such as the works of Frater Achad,A. O. Spare, and even Jack Parsons. While “normative” Thelema (if by that we meanthe OTO of the Grady McMurtry line) may be likened to the official Church, it ispossible that later generations will consider the writings of Frater Achad, Spare, andParsons (among others, and possibly including the works of Necronomicon editorSimon himself) to be “gnostic” versions of the official gospels, much the way oneapproaches the Nag Hammadi texts or the Dead Sea Scrolls. It is not my place todefend any of these ideas on doctrinal grounds. Indeed, in that I have little or nointerest. My usage of them in this place only reflects Grant's own incorporation ofthem in his Gnosis, and should be taken to reflect no agenda of my own.With these caveats in mind, then, let us proceed to an investigation of one of themost-neglected theses in the history of modern occultism: the nature of the Typhonian"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Current and its relationship to Aleister Crowley's Thelema and H.

Forif Crowley's new religion was of a piece with everything that had preceded it, therewould be no point to it, or to discussing it at any great length except as a curiosity.A contemporary of Crowley, the author of gothic horror stories H. P. Lovecraft, hadhis own idea about Aeons: that they represented enormous lengths of time, and that thecontemplation of them (and what life-forms may have evolved during them) woulddrive a normal person insane, as would the contemplation of the vast distances of spacebetween the Earth and the stars. Yet, as with Crowley, he wrote that in certain cases,and with certain Aeons, “even death may die,” or will result, as Crowley wrote, in “thedestruction of the principle of death.” This conquering of death has been a focus ofvirtually every major religion in the last five or six millenia (probably beginning withthe Egyptians). This represents hope for Crowley but absolute horror for Lovecraft; forif death is overcome for some, it would be overcome for all: mass murderers, serialkillers, fiendish dictators ... and the anthropoid monsters of the writer's feverishimagination.Thus we should begin with a look at the concept of the Aeon.

Also, the idea that the end of the world is near—vide the Mayancalendar, the Nostradamus prophecies, and other chiliastic concerns—lends moresignificance to any discussion of the Aeons, the New Age, and the astronomical ideasthey represent.Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) claimed to be the Prophet of the new age, the Aeon ofHorus, and the Book of the Law its scripture. Received over the course of threeafternoons in Cairo, Egypt in April of 1904, Crowley himself rejected it at first. Someof the language is offensive, particularly when it comes to describing the world's greatreligions. The vehemence with which Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, etc are denigratedseems far from what we have come to expect of spiritual literature. However, a re-readof the first few books of the Bible would be educational in this regard, for the God ofthe Jews was just as vehement in his attack on all other gods, all other religions. A re-read of the Book of Revelations (also known as the Apocalypse) would reinforce thisimpatience of the God of Christians and Jews with any and all other forms of religiousexpression. This vehemence was often backed up with military force, and themassacres of hundreds of thousands of men, women and children was the bloodyresult. Thus the anger and hatred for earlier faiths shown in the Book of the Law isconsistent with Old and New Testament attitudes, if nothing else, and seems of a piecewith the contemporary world's religious polarization.The structure of the Book of the Law is that of three chapters, each devoted to adifferent Egyptian deity or deities and each represented as the speech of that deity via apraeterhuman intelligence or spiritual intermediary called Aiwass, a being thatCrowley later claimed was his Holy Guardian Angel. This occurred as a series ofinspired or channeled scriptures over the course of those three days from April 8 to 10,1904. The readings began after Crowley's wife—Rose Kelly—alerted Crowley to theimmediacy of the contact during a visit to the Boulaq Museum in Cairo on the vernalequinox that year, at which time she drew his attention to a stele numbered 666, nowknown to the faithful as the “Stele of Revealing.” This particular stele was a burialplaque for a priest of the Egyptian god Mentu. The priest's name was Ankh-ef-en-khonsu. Each session took place in their apartment between the hours of 12 and 1 pm.(It is possible that the dictations occurred at the precise hour of the mid-day call toprayer, and that they would have heard the muezzin's cry outside their hotel roomwindow right before, during or after the séance.)It could be considered natural that the scripture would have an Egyptian coloration,considering all the external circumstances. However, the character of Crowley's ownprevious initiations into a British secret society known as the Golden Dawn would alsohave an impact on the terminology (if not the philosophy) of the text as we will see. So"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"what we will look at first in this chapter is the nature of the “Egyptology” of the Bookof the Law and its relation to the concept of the Aeons."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Egyptian TrinitiesThe three chapters are the utterances of the Egyptian gods Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit (respectively). Structurally, this seems consistent with Egyptian practice. TheEgyptian religion contains many such “trinities” of supreme gods at the head of thevarious pantheons. One of the oldest is that of Ptah, Sekhmet and Nefertum; anotherwould be that of Amun, Mut and Khonsu. The most famous is perhaps that of Osiris,Isis and Horus. In each case, we are presented with a male god, a female goddess, and achild god. In other words, a nuclear family. We rarely, if ever, come across this type ofconfiguration in the Tantric pantheons of Tibet and India, for instance, where theemphasis is usually on a male and a female deity; while there are offspring of theseunions, they are rarely depicted as a family unit in the way of the Egyptian examples.However, the trinity Nuit/Hadit/Ra-Hoor-Khuit is not a typical one in Egyptiantexts. Nuit is a star goddess and the mother of Set and Nephthys. Hadit—according tothe Book of the Law and to Crowley's subsequent writings—is either a star within thatempyrean or a solar disk; as the sun is a star this is not as inconsistent as it mightappear. The third god, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, has much more in common with forms of Horus—offspring of Isis and Osiris—rather than with any conceivable union of Nuit and thelesser-known Hadit (which is itself a form of Horus). We may venture to say that thiscombination is unique to Crowley and to the Book of the Law.Yet, there is another deity specifically mentioned in the scripture, and that isKhonsu. Crowley, in his role as scribe of Aiwass and of the gods, is given the titleAnkh af-n-Khonsu after the name of the priest whose burial plaque was the Stele ofRevealing. The two terms ankh and Khonsu bear some further investigation.Ankh, of course, is the iconic symbol of the Egyptian idea of immortality. The wordankh means “life” and is found on temples and tombs everywhere in Egypt with theassociated idea of immortality and life after death. Egyptian pharaohs as well as deitiesare often depicted holding an ankh, sometimes also called the crux ansata or “crosswith handle.”Khonsu, however, may not be as well known. It is the name of another child god,sacred to the moon. This god was usually depicted in mummified form, but with thelock of hair on the right side of his head typical of Egyptian children of ancient times.This is used to emphasize the youth of the god with the implication that he is pre-pubescent. His mother was Mut (not to be confused with Maat), a self-created mothergoddess whose symbols were the vulture and the lion and whose name means“mother.” In northern Egypt, she became identified with the lion goddess Sekhmet and,at various times, with the cat goddess Bast. Khonsu's father was Amun (sometimesAmen or Amoun), the mysterious self-created god of whom Ra was often considered tobe the external image, hence the composite form Amun-Ra.While Khonsu was a lunar deity, and often depicted as a child, he also had warrior"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"tendencies in the Egyptian religion. He was believed to be a defender of the king, whodestroyed his enemies by removing their internal organs and presenting them to theking for nourishment. This odd mythologem gave rise to one epithet of Khonsu as the“king's placenta” and, indeed, he later became identified with childbirth (just as Setwould later be identified with miscarriage and abortion).This idea of Khonsu as the king's defender shares some ideas in common withHorus, who avenged the murder of his father, Osiris. Often, Khonsu is depicted with ahawk's head—recalling Horus explicitly—with a lunar disk and crescent above it toidentify him more carefully with the moon, as opposed to the more solar aspect ofHorus. In addition, Khonsu was also depicted in a very suggestive way at his temple inKarnak: as “a ram-headed snake who fertilized the cosmic egg.”4 This identification ofKhonsu with the Cosmic Egg of creation will have resonance later, as the vision of theEgg comes to play in the Amalantrah Working of Crowley and associates,5 as well aswith the “Blue Egg of Harpocrates” in the rituals of the Golden Dawn.But it is the presentation of Khonsu as a child that has relevance for the Book of theLaw. Khonsu is referred to in Egyptian mythology as the “Moon Child,” which wouldbecome the title of one of Aleister Crowley's novels. This same image—of a child god—is found in the statues and bas-reliefs of Harpocrates, a form of Horus and, indeed,this form is mentioned in the Book of the Law several times.6 Crowley, as a “priest ofKhonsu” deliberately makes the association with a child-god who is also a martialdeity, a defender of the king. In the case of Khonsu's father—Amun—we have thearchetype of the “Hidden God” that figures so prominently in the work of KennethGrant and to which we will return from time to time.The first chapter of the Book of the Law consists of the words of Nuit, the goddess ofthe night sky, who is often depicted with her feet in the west, her hands in the east, andher body thus gracefully arched over the earth, and dotted with stars.The second chapter reveals the words of Hadit, the Heru-Behdeti of the Egyptianpantheon, called Haidith in Greek. Hadit was recruited by Thoth (the Egyptian god ofmagic, writing, and wisdom) to assist Horus in the latter's famous battle with Set.Hadit represents a single point of light, a single star in the empyrean of Nuit. If Nuit isvisualized as a circle, then Hadit would be the point in the center. In the Thelemicuniverse Nuit and Hadit also may represent different forms or ideas about infinity,perhaps infinite expansion and infinite contraction respectively.The third chapter consists of the revelation of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, or Ra-Herakhty inGreek recension. This is a deity composed of two different ideas: Ra and Horus. Thetranslation of Ra-Herakhty is “Ra, Horus on the Horizon.” Thus there is the sense thatRa—the quintessential Sun god of the Egyptians—manifests as Horus when on thehorizon, i.e., when the sun is rising or setting. Horus is the son of Osiris and Isis and isthe god who battled Set (in one version of the story) to avenge his father's murder."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Thus, there is the implication that the identity of Horus is inextricably linked to hisparentage, and that Horus's purpose as the Avenging Son thus connects him eternallywith Set: a union not of love, but of war. This “unity” of Horus with Set is an idea thatCrowley embraced and which appears several times in his published work.7 Ra-Hoor-Khuit is mentioned frequently throughout all three chapters of the Book of the Law,and is obviously the focal point of the scripture.It is thus Horus—and especially the form of Ra-Hoor-Khuit—who will occupy mostof the attention of Thelema, for he is the symbol of the New Aeon that replaces theearlier Aeon of Osiris. However, there is a darker—more mysterious and to some anextraterrestrial—aspect to the New Aeon, and it concerns the intermediary betweenCrowley and the gods of the Book of the Law: the entity known variously as Aiwaz orAiwass.Crowley himself referred to this being as Set-Aiwass or Shaitan-Aiwass in some ofhis writings,8 thus linking it with both the Egyptian god of “Evil”—Set or Seth—andwith the Middle Eastern name for God's (or humanity's) “Adversary”: Shaitan, morepopularly known as Satan (but “reclaimed” by the Mesopotamian sect of the Yezidis ina rehabilitated form, about which more later). This refers to a very early, predynastic(i.e., 3500-3000 BCE), form of Egyptian religion that identified Set as a god of thedesert, of storms, and of rage. Much later, the Greeks at the time of the historianHerodotus (c. 484-425 BCE) identified Set with their own sea monster, Typhon. (It wasthis Typhon that gave its name to Kenneth Grant's new form of Thelema, theTyphonian Order, representing what he called the Typhonian/Stellar Current.) Set wasalso said to reside in the Great Bear constellation, and served to aid the souls of thedead to attain immortality by allowing them to climb Set's “stairway to heaven.”9 Likemost Egyptian deities, Set originally had both a positive and a negative nature but inthe end the negative aspect of the god won out due to popular attribution. As the swornenemy of Horus, Set was seen as the eternal Evil One and the murderer of Horus'sfather, Osiris. He was also said to have been born unnaturally, ripping himself throughthe belly of his mother, the sky goddess Nut or Nuit who figures so prominently in theCrowley scriptures. Thus, he could be seen as an initiatory force.Indeed, Set's role in the New Aeon could be described as that of the Grand Initiatorof humanity. However, this type of initiation will be violent and imposed from outside,rather than the relatively serene form experienced by Crowley himself during hissojourn with the considerably more sedate Golden Dawn. We can see this type ofviolent and involuntary initiation prefigured in the psychological experiments of theworld's intelligence agencies beginning in the 1950s with the phenomenon of the“Manchurian Candidate” of the Korean War era that contributed to the creation ofmind control, behavior control, and psychological warfare programs that sought tounpack the secrets of the human mind by using unsuspecting innocent men, women and"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"children as test subjects and guinea pigs.10Thus we have a rather paradoxical relationship in which Set-Aiwass communicatesthe text of the Aeon of Horus (his sworn enemy) to Crowley in Cairo. Crowley elevatedthe status of Set far above that which obtained in dynastic Egypt, and saw in Set thetype of force necessary to bring in the new Aeon. This may be considered an“initiated” view of traditional Egyptology which understands Set and Horus asimplacable foes. If the myths concerning Set were little more than libels created byfollowers of the newer gods Osiris and Horus, what was the truth? What did Set reallyrepresent, and what is Set's relationship to the Aeon of Horus?As Crowley's understanding of the Book of the Law matured, so did hisunderstanding of Aiwaz, whom he declared to be none other than his Holy GuardianAngel11: a concept developed by the Golden Dawn, the secret society that had initiatedhim into magic. The Holy Guardian Angel or HGA can be conceived of as one's“Higher Self” or as the apotheosis of one's own spiritual identity; conversely, one's selfis seen as a manifestation (one among many) of the Angel. In Crowley's case, heviewed Aiwaz to be one of the gods of ancient Sumer, thus pre-existing the Egyptiancivilization and their oldest known divinity, the desert god Set, who might then beconsidered an avatar or emanation of the original Sumerian archetype.In addition, Crowley proposed a composite Set-Horus “current” that would representthe combined tension of the two antagonists as a single force emblematic of the NewAeon. This was typical of Crowley's tinkering with the known Egyptology of the day. Itdid not reflect any new discoveries in the field, but was rather informed by his occultinsight into the play of spiritual forces represented by “god forms” and ideasassociated with the Egyptian gods in the consciousness of the Western mind of theearly twentieth century. As we have seen, he also combined Set, Shaitan and Aiwazinto a single concept representing not only his own HGA but also a deity or devil fromthe little-known civilization of Sumer.12 Thus, we have the Egyptian Set, the SemiticShaitan, and a Sumerian god identified only by the word Aiwaz or Aiwass—which hasno meaning in the Sumerian language—all lumped together without regard forindividual religious or social contexts. From the point of view of mainstream religiousstudies or anthropology—especially postmodern anthropology—this is a car wreck of aproportion equivalent to a major highway pile-up.It is perhaps relevant to point out at this juncture that one cannot refer to any ofCrowley's writings as representative of formal Egyptological theory or research.Crowley is not an academic source for this type of material. Rather, he was aninterpreter of the Egyptological discoveries of his day, such as those by GastonMaspero (1846-1916) and most especially of the amateur Egyptologist Gerald Massey(1828-1907), whose fanciful—and esoterically-oriented—descriptions of the ancientworld were never taken seriously by mainstream archaeologists but which were"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"embraced by occultists. The theories of Massey still exert an important influence overoccult authors today, regardless of the fact that they are considered in error (at best) orwholly imaginary (at worst).Crowley's interpretations—like those of Massey—were freeform, conforming to hisown experiences as an occultist and magician. The occultism of the nineteenth andearly twentieth centuries largely was indebted to universalist ideas of “commonorigins,” a worldview which in its extreme form took as a given the existence of an Ur-cult or Ur-religion in the remote past that provided the inspiration and basis for allfuture cults. Thus, the religions of Sumer and Egypt had a source in common withthose of India and China, and even the Aztec and Mayan religions of Latin America.Symbols that were discovered in several vastly different locales—such as the Dragon—were believed to represent a single, common idea regardless of whether the Dragonsymbol was carved on a stone block in England or seen on a porcelain fragment inChina. This idea—that same or similar symbols were evidence of a single belief orcultural phenomenon—was taken to its logical conclusion by the Nazis who raced tofind evidence of the swastika on ancient remains around the world, thus supportingtheir contention that a single, Aryan race was responsible for all of humancivilization.13 We can see a similar trend in the present era with all the talk of ancientaliens having “given” the human race its science, its architecture, and its religions. In asense, this is close to Lovecraft's idea that an ancient race from the stars once inhabitedthe Earth.In Crowley's day, however, this approach was exciting and encouraged a great dealof amateur speculation on the history of the ancient world. While universalism hasbeen discredited by the philosophers of the Frankfurt School and their associatedpostmodern approach to theories of knowledge and interpretation, with its fetishism ofcultural differences and uniqueness, some elements of its worldview stubbornlyremain. Rather than throw out the proverbial baby with the bathwater, it can beacknowledged that certain aspects of the human condition—birth, death, sexuality—are identical among all members of the human race, and that while differentapproaches may be taken to sacralize or otherwise interpret these aspects they arenonetheless “universals” and their comparison across ethnic, racial and environmentallines may contribute to a better understanding of the human condition.So, when Crowley wrote—seemingly recklessly—about a “Set-Horus” current inoccultism, or identified Set with Shaitan and with a Sumerian Aiwaz, he was notreferring specifically to these ideas as they are understood by scholars or wereunderstood by the indigenous peoples who contributed them to the world's body ofknowledge. Instead, he was emphasizing certain perceived qualities that he deemedcognate, without overmuch regard for their historical context. At the same time, oneshould not infer that Crowley's “Egyptology” needs to remain at odds with normativeEgyptology. On the contrary, by supplementing Crowley's writings on the subject with"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"recent scholarship in the field many advantages accrue and discoveries occur and,where necessary, corrections may be made.A further defense of Crowley's Egyptology may be made in light of the fact that theEgyptian religion itself went through many changes over the course of its roughly threethousand—four thousand years of history. Gods and goddesses changed attributes overtime, changed rulerships and characteristics, and even parentage. Their sacred siteswere moved, or renamed. Their effigies defaced as new cults emerged. Often godswere merged with other gods to form new, composite forms. Thus one could make theargument—perhaps only slightly frivolously—that the Book of the Law represents anew iteration of the Egyptian religion and continues the developmental process begunin the pre-Dynastic era.Another factor to be taken into consideration is one that is frequently ignored, evenby those who claim a certain degree of expertise in this area, and that is the fact thatCrowley had been initiated into the Golden Dawn and framed much of his magical andesoteric worldview within the Golden Dawn structure of rituals and instructions. Thus,we first come across Hoor-par-kraat, Osiris, Isis, Nu, Maat and many of the otherCrowleyan references in this context: in the Golden Dawn rituals themselves, the onesused to initiate Crowley, which had a profound affect on his consciousness and hisintellectual and spiritual development. In fact, certain phrases in the Book of the Lawmake no sense whatsoever without reference to those very rituals.As an example, we can refer to the very first chapter wherein it is written:Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs. Ra-Hoor-Khuit hathtaken his seat in the East at the Equinox of the Gods; and let Asar be with Isa,who also are one. But they are not of me. Let Asar be the adorant, Isa thesufferer; Hoor in his secret name and splendour is the Lord initiating. (AL I:49)In his “New Comment” to the Book of the Law, Crowley himself clearly states:The general allusion is to the Equinox Ritual of the GD where the officer ofthe previous six months, representing Horus, took the place of the retiringHierophant, who had represented Osiris.Thus, the replacement of Osiris by Horus—i.e., the old Aeon by the New—wasalready prefigured in the rituals with which Crowley was completely familiar, butwhich would have been incomprehensible to an outsider. In that ritual Horus wasrepresented by the officer known as the Hiereus (or “priest”). Osiris was theHierophant (or “high priest”), and another of the important officers was the Hegemon(“leader” or “guide”), which was the Goddess Maat, and indeed the hall of initiationsin the neophyte ceremony was called the Hall of Maat. (In the verse from the Book ofthe Law cited above, Asar is Osiris and Isa may be Isis or Jesus.14) Thus, the gods ofthe Book of the Law were speaking to Crowley in a Golden Dawn context (since the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"allusions make no sense outside of the very specific Golden Dawn rituals). They wereusing his initiation as a channel through which to communicate, to make their wordsknown and understood.What this means is that the cultus of Thelema and the organizations that grew out ofit—the AA, Grant's Typhonian Order, etc.—have the Golden Dawn system as theirbase. (The OTO does not have any connection to the Golden Dawn, either through itsearliest founders or its ritual structure.) Intellectually—if not spiritually—Thelemacan be truly understood only within that system and is thus (from a historical point ofview) a development of what began as the Golden Dawn in nineteenth century England.Crowley's own organization, the Argentum Astrum or AA, is a “perfection” of theoriginal Golden Dawn system of grades, with the addition of the three degreesrepresenting the three spheres at the top of the Tree of Life: the ones not assigned bythe Golden Dawn itself since they were believed to be outside the understanding ofnormal human beings. Crowley claimed to have attained each of those degrees, andthen set about reforming the Golden Dawn system by making Thelemic adjustments toall of the degree rituals, and by adding Asian mystical practices to the curriculum:including Hatha Yoga and Buddhist meditation methods and terminology."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Egyptian AeonsEven so, Thelema was designed to be a revolutionary spiritual movement, at once asgrounded in science as in faith. It would overthrow Western ideas of spirituality, ofmorality and ethics, by replacing them with a worldview very similar in some respectsto that of Buddhism. The death of the Ego is a familiar Buddhist concept; but at thesame time Crowley calls for an end to the “limitation of the Mind by Reason.” InCrowley's theology, as in some forms of Zen Buddhism, one must transcend both faithand reason in order to attain the highest illumination. Yet, paradoxically perhaps, bothfaith and reason are tools in the arsenal of the Thelemic magician.How, then, is Crowley's system different from Buddhism?In terms of Aeons, there are similarities. In Buddhist cosmology, there is the greatmeasurement of time, or mahakalpa, which is divided into four kalpas or aeons. Eachkalpa is extraordinarily long in terms of the human measurement of time and can takehundreds of thousands, or even millions or billions, of years to pass. The four basickalpas are Vivartakalpa (the Aeon of evolution in which creation occurs),Vivartasthayikalpa (the Aeon of duration of evolution), Samvartakalpa (the Aeon ofdissolution), and finally Samvartast-hayikalpa (the Aeon of the duration ofdissolution). These are similar in concept to the Hindu system of yugas, describedbelow, and are based on an idea that creation begins in a perfect or pure state—“in illotempore”—and then gradually disintegrates through the passage of time. But there is ajudgemental aspect to both the Buddhist and Hindu concepts of the Aeons, andCrowley was not immune to this concept. He characterized the Aeon of Isis asconsiderably more pleasant than the Aeon of Osiris, and the Aeon of Horus as a kind ofnecessary corrective which would culminate in an Aeon of Maat that would wipe theslate clean and start all over again.Yet while Crowley praised Hindu and Buddhist forms of meditation, yoga, and theircorresponding methods of attainment of altered states of consciousness, and instructedhis students to become proficient in all of these, he rejected many of the doctrines ofBuddhism—as he had all previous manifestations of religion—as superceded by hisown cultus. He had difficulty accepting the core concept of Buddhism, that allexistence is sorrow and that sorrow proceeds from attachment. Crowley embraced lifein all its forms and could not bring himself to refrain from tasting every flavor itoffered. In this he could claim to have transcended attachment by indulging in allforms of sensation, accepting none and rejecting all in the process. Yet Crowley'sapproach to Buddhism—as it was to all previous forms of religion, spirituality andmagic—was purely mechanical and pragmatic. The previous religions were viewed aspossessing technologies that could be mastered, and not faiths to believe in. Certainlytheir theologies were rejected as obsolete and even dangerous. As his famous coupletstates:"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"We place no reliance on virgin or pigeonOur method is science, our aim is religion.Paradoxically, however, Crowley frequently refers to Asian religious concepts in hiswritings and indicates that he values what they represent. He speaks of samadhi, anatta,advaita, the chakras, Kundalini, lingam and yoni, and other Buddhist and Hinduconcepts with approval. He strives to attain samadhi, for instance, and reprimandshimself for clinging to attachment. One could be forgiven for seeing in Crowley'sdiaries, his Confessions, and his letters a western man attempting to dominate easternmystical practices. However, if this was all Crowley was—a New Age proto-hippie insearch of enlightenment in the hashish parlors of Nepal or the yoga studios of midtownManhattan—then we would not be interested in him. For Crowley, these Asian systemsare just that: systems. Systems to be worked. Methods to be employed. For all hisattraction to Asian ways of thought and culture—perhaps starting with his friendshipwith Alan Bennett, the Bhikhu Ananda Metteya and one of the first Englishmen tobring Buddhism to the United Kingdom—Crowley was still a western man. He did nottake the vows of a Buddhist monk, as did his close friend Bennett. He did not workunder a Hindu, Buddhist or Daoist teacher or guru. It was his mission to make thesedisparate forms of religious experience—Asian, European—work for him, becomeelements of his own philosophy. The “double-wanded” power that he wrote about sofrequently could be construed as Crowley himself, uniting both Asian and Europeanpaths to God in a single system. This insistence on bringing together both hemispheresto produce a “syzygy”—to use the Valentinian Gnostic term (see below)—is typical ofCrowley's mindset. Indeed, he even insists that Horus is really a twin: Ra-Hoor-Khuitand Hoor-par-kraat, Horus and Harpocrates, the Avenging Son and the Babe of Silence,respectively—as if unable (or simply unwilling) to commit entirely to a singleidentifiable entity.The Aeon of Horus, then, is the Age of the Child. The child will try anything once,will test boundaries, will explore each sense to its fullest capacity. The infant does notbelieve: it has not yet reached that point where belief is necessary as a technique ofavoiding confrontation with an unpleasant reality. The infant has no ideology torestrain it, to force it to choose one path over another. As Crowley himself writes inthis regard:The child is not merely a symbol of growth, but of complete moralindependence and innocence. We may then expect the New Aeon to releasemankind from its pretence of altruism, its obsession of fear and itsconsciousness of sin. It will possess no consciousness of the purpose of its ownexistence. It will not be possible to persuade it that it should submit toincomprehensible standards; it will suffer from spasms of transitory passion; itwill be absurdly sensitive to pain and suffer from meaningless terror; it will be"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"utterly conscienceless, cruel, helpless, affectionate and ambitious, withoutknowing why; it will be incapable of reason, yet at the same time intuitivelyaware of truth.15But before we investigate the Aeon of Horus—and Frater Achad's Aeon of Maat—ingreater detail, we must first understand what an Aeon might be.The usual meaning of the term is that of a period of time, usually a very long period oftime, but the precise length varies from culture to culture, from context to context. It'sroot comes from an ancient Greek word meaning “life” and is thus conceptually relatedto the Egyptian ankh.In Gnosticism—the spiritual tradition embraced by many occultists of thenineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Europe and the Americas—the word aeonrefers to an emanation (or characteristic) of God. Thus, the Gnostic aeons include suchconcepts as Arche (“the beginning”) and Proarche (“before the beginning”), amongother designations, with their associated references to Time. The term aeon can also beused to refer to the fullness of God perceived as an emanation itself.Perhaps the closest in meaning and sense to Crowley's use of the term is that of theValentinians, an early (2nd century CE) Gnostic sect for whom the aeons were createdin male/female pairs called syzygies of which there were fifteen,16 for a total of thirtyaeons. It is important to realize that these aeons were emanations from God andtherefore divine themselves, much in the way the Jewish mystics perceived theemanations that became the sephirot of the Tree of Life.As they were emanations, their existence took place in Time. Until that process ofemanation took place, God was silent and creation had not yet begun. (This is similarto the Indian tradition that the world was not created until Parvati seduced theotherwise monastic and celibate Shiva. In this view, God has to be urged to create.)When the emanations began, Time also began. This may explain the relationshipbetween the concept of Aeon as “emanation” and Aeon as “period of time.” They arelinked, and one presumes the other. This is what we find in Crowley's schema of theAeon of Isis, proceeded by the Aeon of Osiris and then to the present-day Aeon ofHorus. They reflect periods of time (similar to the precession of the equinoxes that hasgiven us the “Age of Aquarius”) but they are also personified periods of time. They areperiods in which the designated God or Emanation rules.Specifically with Valentinianism, the Aeon known as Sophia (“wisdom”) causedcreation as we know it to take place. Sophia is feminine, the youngest of all the Aeons.She wished to know the Father and went on a quest to find God. She may be thought ofas an analogous figure to that of the Shekinah in Jewish mysticism: a feminine figureremoved from the Source of creation who is then reunited with God in a mysticalmarriage. In the Valentinian version, she became “divided”17: one aspect of Sophia"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"was caught down in the lower realms, in physical creation, separated from God.Another aspect—her original self—remained in the upper realms. The two aspectswere separated by something called “the Limit,” which was a border between thefullness of God in the Pleroma and God's creation in the material world. This Limit18was personified by the Valentinian concept known as Horos, which some scholarsbelieve is the Gnostic interpretation of the Egyptian god Horus: the same Horus whofigures so prominently in the Book of the Law. Interestingly, this concept wasenshrined in the very origin of the Egyptian Horus, as described in the Coffin Textsand as explained by Mordechai Gilula in an article published in the Journal ofEgyptian Archaeology:Coffin Texts, Spell 148 narrates the birth of Horus. Having been delivered of herson, Isis addresses him in these words: Bk s3. Hr hms r·k m t3 pn n t·k Wsr mrn·k pw n bk hr(y) znbw hwt ‘Imn-rn, “O falcon, my son Horus, dwell in thisland of your father Osiris in this your name of Falcon who is on (or ‘aboveor’)the battlements of the mansion of Him-whose-name-is-hidden” (CT II, 221c-e).This is the actual naming of Horus who, until his birth, is referred to as Bk(219b).19What is striking about this information is that Horus at his birth is associated with“the battlements of the mansion”: i.e., he rests atop the border between the celestialand the earthly worlds, which is precisely what the Gnostic Horos represents: theLimit. In addition, the “mansion” referred to in the Coffin Text is that of “Him-whose-name-is-hidden,” in other words, the Hidden God—the Deus Absconditus or Amun—which is the title of one of Kenneth Grant's studies of the Typhonian Current.20 This“limit” may be thought of in terms of Victor Turner's concept of liminality21: aboundary between two modes or states of being, i.e. the sacred and the profane. In thissense, Horus represents a liminal figure, one who crosses over from one state toanother and thus has some of the characteristics of an initiator.Further, the figure of Isis is cognate with a number of other feminine deities whogive birth without having been impregnated in the usual way. The husband of Isis—Osiris—had been slain by his brother Set and, according to one version of the legend,cut up into fourteen pieces.22 Isis went in search of those pieces and reassembled hermurdered husband in order to impregnate herself and give birth to Horus. We recallthat Mary, the Mother of Jesus, was characterized as a virgin and the birth of Jesus a“virgin birth,” a parthenogenesis. Her Son became the intermediary between humanityand the invisible, hidden God, and was executed on a cross. The symbol for the GnosticHoros was also a cross, identified astronomically as the place where the ecliptic andthe zodiac meet. In the Gnostic universe, the Aeon Sophia also attempted to give birthto a child parthenogenically, i.e., without benefit of intercourse.In India—locus of much of Grant's attention as well as considerable study by"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Crowley—we have another instance of creation having been the result of abnormalconception. Shiva is portrayed as a monastic living in the wild who spends most of histime in meditation. He is aroused by his wife, Uma (or sometimes Parvati), to engagein sexual intercourse. However, Shiva has enormous stamina and the couple engage inintercourse for millenia until the gods can take the sound of it no longer and distractShiva so that he withdraws from Uma at the moment of ejaculation. Uma takes hisseed—either in her mouth, or in her hand depending on the text—and impregnatesherself with it, thus conceiving the created world.23 This sounds suspiciously similar tothe way in which Isis conceived Horus except that in the Egyptian version the husbandof Isis has been murdered, while in the Indian version, Shiva is still very much alive.Both Isis and Uma, however, give birth to sons who may be considered avengers,Uma/Parvati giving birth to Skanda,24 commander of the Devas in battle with thedemon Taraka.In India, where periods of time are inordinately huge, we are believed to be living inthe yuga—or “age”—of Kali. This is a period of hundreds of thousands of years(according to some sources) which is said to have begun in the year 3102 BCE. It is thelast of four yugas or ages: Satya yuga, Dvapara yuga, Treta yuga and Kali yuga. TheKali yuga is ruled by the demon Kali (not Kali the goddess), a symbol of strife andconflict, a fearsome creature sometimes depicted carrying a huge sword or otherweapon.Thus, even in India, an Aeon can be identified with a supernatural being. The namesof the previous three yugas can be translated as Truth (Satya), Double (Dvapara), andTriple (Treta). These are designations that don't appear to have specific deitiesattached to them by name, but the ages themselves do reflect the actions of variousdeities in the relevant Indian texts, such as the Mahabharata. In the Indian system, thechronological order of the yugas reflects a degeneration of the quality of spirituality,from the perfect age in Satya yuga to the increasingly vice-ridden ages of Dvapara andTreta, to the thoroughly corrupt Kali yuga: an age in which Lord Krishna hascompletely withdrawn himself from humanity. This is paralleled in the Buddhistcosmological system of the kalpas, mentioned above.Obviously, Crowley's concept of the Aeons is slightly more optimistic and a lotsimpler. There is no specific sense of an ongoing spiritual degradation or degeneration;there are, in fact, no clear moral judgments being made at all about the spiritual qualityof each Aeon; only that the processes they represent are inevitable and inescapable.Although the Aeon of Horus is identified with warlike imagery, it also represents theflowering of individual freedom through the abandonment of ideas of sin andrestriction. Rather than devolve from Aeon to Aeon, human potential is reawakened indifferent ways, leading to an ultimate perfection. Indeed, the concept of perfectibility—so crucial to understanding western alchemy with its processes of transformation—"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"is central to Crowley's initiatory scheme. It is the Aeon of Horus that provides theavenues through which the human population in general (rather than an elitist handfulof adepts) attains this perfection. In this very important sense, Crowley's philosophy isat odds with Asian ideas of kalpas and yugas. While Buddhism, for example, providesthe techniques for a dedicated individual to attain nirvana and defeat the endless cycleof rebirth, it does not propose that all of humanity will—or can—do so at once, orduring a single two-thousand-year period of time, but only through many millions ofyears with the assistance of Boddhisattvas: human beings who have attained all but theultimate stage of complete enlightenment but who have taken a vow not to completethe initiatory path until all sentient beings have done so first. This type of self-sacrificeis presumably anathema in Thelema, a holdover from the previous Aeon of Osiris inwhich a god suffers for the sake of humanity.Crowley's scheme does reflect some controversial anthropological theories currentat the time, however, proposing that there was a matriarchal society that preceded apatriarchal one. This concept was popularized in the early 20th century by such authorsas Marija Gimbutas, Robert Graves, and by Margaret Murray in her influential—though heavily-criticized—works on the alleged European witchcraft cult, The God ofthe Witches and The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, and even earlier by the Swissanthropologist J. J. Bachofen in his Myth, Religion and Mother Right (1861). Thus,Crowley posits a matriarchal Aeon of Isis that precedes the more patriarchal Aeon ofOsiris. This matriarchal-patriarchal chronology has been largely discredited. It shouldbe noted that there is no real historical precedent for this as an Egyptological scheme,and it does not appear in any standard works by archaeologists or other specialists inEgyptian history and religion. It comes, instead, directly from the Book of the Law.As mentioned above, however, the Book of the Law owes much to the initiatorysystem that produced Aleister Crowley, that of the Golden Dawn. In this system, one ofthe more important and revealing initiation rituals is the very first, the Neophyteinitiation ritual. Within this ritual may be discovered elements of all the succeedingones. It is here that Maat—as Themaist,25 and as Hegemon—first appears. It is alsohere that one gets the first glimpse of what an Equinox of the Gods might entail, and ofhow the Crowleyan Aeons were conceived.The Golden Dawn rituals were published by an initiate—Francis Israel Regardie(1907-1985)—who was an intimate of Aleister Crowley (during the period 1928-1932),and thus had a ring-side seat for much of what was taking place in the western occultworld at the time. Regardie joined the Stella Matutina (a successor to the Golden Dawnthat used its rituals) in 1934 and eventually (1937-1940) published their secret ritualsand other material in a four-volume hardcover set, an action for which he was heavilycriticized by members of the Order.The Equinox ritual, published in Regardie's magnum opus includes a number oftemple officers representing Egyptian gods, and the uttering of a password for the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"season. The ceremony is based on the point at which the days and nights are of equallength—the “equal night” or equinox—that takes place on the first day of spring andon the first day of autumn, the vernal and autumnal equinoxes respectively. Accordingto the Golden Dawn ritual, a Word is changed from one equinox to the other with acorresponding change of Hierophant. This idea of an Equinox of the Gods, with achange of the guard as it were, and the creation or utterance of a new Word is central tothe Book of the Law and to Crowley's entire Thelemic worldview.The Book of the Law saga begins with Crowley and Rose Kelly (his first wife)visiting Cairo, Egypt in March of 1904. Sylphs appearing to the couple in the King'sChamber of the Great Pyramid on March 16, followed by a stream of cosmic messagesto Rose during the next few days, convinced Crowley that Horus was in fact addressinghim directly through Rose—his first Scarlet Woman. She demanded he “break all therules” and helped him design an invocation of Horus that he successfully performed onthe Spring Equinox, March 20. Now known as the “Supreme Ritual,” this is theinvocation that ushered in the New Aeon, the day when “the world was destroyed byfire,” the “Equinox of the Gods.” Rose's identification of the image of Horus (Ra-Hoor-Khuit) on the Stele of Revealing (exhibit number 666 in the Boulaq Museum!) asthe communicating Intelligence was the final proof for Crowley. Although the Book ofthe Law would not be received until weeks later, from April 8 to 10, Crowley imaginesthat the vernal equinox was the real starting point of the new Aeon of Horus. Of course,it is the day when—according to the Golden Dawn rubric—Horus takes over fromOsiris as Hierophant, sitting on Osiris's throne in the East. In Crowley's case, what wasperformed ritualistically for decades within the temples of the Golden Dawn and itssuccessors occurred in reality on March 20, 1904. If one reads the Book of the Law inthis context, it all begins to make sense.But it also raises many other questions. Many contemporary occultists, esotericists,and New Agers by definition believe that we are on the cusp of a new phase of humanexistence. From the rather vague concept of an Aquarian Age of peace and harmony toDoomsday predictions of mass extinction, what these ideas have in common is theirlack of specific focus on the individual. Crowley's Cairo revelation—while similar inmany respects to both the dreamy New Age version of a renewed humanity to theDoomsday predictions of war and violence—shifted the emphasis from generalredemption and/or general holocaust to one of individual empowerment. Individualidentity—and the survival of that identity—seems to be important in the Thelemicscheme of things. After all, as it is written in the Book of the Law: “Every man andevery woman is a star.” (AL I:3) Thelemites believe they have something to do withcreating or facilitating the New Age. This may reflect the means through which theNew Age was revealed to Crowley, i.e., in the context of a secret society of magiciansrather than on a mountaintop in Sinai or a cave in Saudi Arabia. It took place in arented apartment in the city of Cairo, and was revealed to an Englishman. There thus"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"was no specifically ethnic context to the revelation. It was not Moses among the Jews,Jesus among the Jews, or Mohammed among the Arabs. It was not even Buddha amongthe Indians or Lao Ze among the Chinese. The revelation came out of nowhere, to twoBrits on their honeymoon in Egypt. Certainly, the deities who spoke to Crowley wereEgyptian, and Crowley was in Egypt. But Crowley himself was not Egyptian, nor washis wife. Why was the revelation not made to indigenous Egyptians? Was it because, asMuslims or Coptic Christians, they presumably would not have been open to such amessage? The implication is that Crowley's prior exposure to Egyptian material in thecontext of the Golden Dawn initiations provided the appropriate channel for theEgyptian deities to manifest, and his presence in Cairo—in the shadow of thepyramids, the Sphinx, and the Valley of the Kings—made it that much easier. Further,the manifestation of the pre-Islamic Egyptian gods in the middle of Islamic Cairowould anticipate some of the more controversial statements in the Book of the Lawconcerning Jesus, Mary, and most especially Mohammed:I am in a secret fourfold word, the blasphemy against all gods of men.Curse them! Curse them! Curse them!With my Hawk's head I peck at the eyes of Jesus as he hangs upon the cross.I flap my wings in the face of Mohammed & blind him.With my claws I tear out the flesh of the Indian and the Buddhist, Mongol andDin.Bahlasti! Ompehda! I spit on your crapulous creeds.Let Mary inviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women beutterly despised among you! (AL III: 49-55)These sentiments were as revolting to Crowley at the time they were written as theymay be to us today. The vitriol with which other faiths are attacked in these passages—in the mouth of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the Avenging Son of Osiris—may reflect the tensionthat exists in Egypt over the presence of so many ancient, but pagan and polytheist,monuments in a predominantly Muslim country during an era of Islamic resurgenceand identity conflict. Indeed, at the time this book is being written we are informed ofcertain radical Islamic groups in Egypt26 that want the pyramids and other ancientedifices destroyed in the name of the faith, in much the same way the Talibandestroyed the famous Buddha statues of Bamiyan, Afghanistan in early 2001. Thus, inthe eyes of some radical religionists, it is time for a New Aeon of Islam with Arabcharacteristics to utterly remove all traces of pre-Islamic (i.e., non-Arab) religionanywhere they can be found—something the followers of the Prophet Muhammadattempted to do to the pyramids and the Sphinx on their drive through Egypt in themid-seventh century CE. On November 17, 1997 there was a massacre of foreign"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"tourists at the Temple of Hatshepsut, coincidentally at the very site where the Stele ofRevealing was first discovered in 1858 by the French archaeologist François AugusteFerdinand Mariette. The mastermind of the attack was Ayman Al-Zawahiri, at the timehead of the terrorist group Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya and presently the leader of Al-Qaeda after the death of Osama bin Laden. More recently, there is the ongoingdestruction of Timbuktu in Mali by Islamic radicals in that country. One shouldremember that one of the first official acts of the Prophet Muhammad was thedestruction of the pagan shrine in Mecca that had housed 360 idols, a shrine that hetransformed into the Ka'aba.This is a pattern of behavior that, while repugnant to liberal-minded lovers ofreligion and culture everywhere, is represented—at least philosophically, or evenideologically—in the Book of the Law with its insistence on the destruction of the oldfaiths. The difference is only in the nature and character of the religion doing thedestruction, and the violence with which it is attended. While there are no Thelemitescharged with the destruction of Christian or Buddhist iconography—even though thetitular head of the largest and most visible OTO organization is referred to as the“Caliph”(!)—the appearance of these lines in the Book of the Law conceivably couldbe used to signal just such a holocaust if Thelema and its followers ever get the upperhand in a country or region. We have seen how similar passages in the Qur'an havebeen used to justify violence against the Jews, for instance.However, Crowley's entire life and writings are devoted to a syncretic approach toreligion and spirituality—making use of whatever works from whatever culture orreligion or occult practice is available—whereas the worldview of Islamic radicals isviciously opposed to such syncretism and insists on a purely Muslim-Arabinterpretation of all spirituality. It is perhaps ironic that the world's most populousMuslim nation—Indonesia—is opposed to the monolithic, mono-cultural Arabistapproach of Middle Eastern radicals and embraces its own multi-cultural—Hindu,Buddhist, indigenous—religious heritage as part of its national as well as its religiousidentity, demonstrating in real-time a syncretic approach that does not diminish theirIslamic faith but seems instead to strengthen it.While Crowley's scripture spoke of a new Aeon that would abrogate all previousAeons, paradoxically it came in the mouths of ancient Egyptian gods. For Crowley, theAeons are Egyptian. There is a certain element of cultural fetishism where ancientEgypt is concerned (especially among occultists and New Age followers), and in thewest Egyptian crazes come and go. The American fascination with the traveling KingTut exhibit in 1976-1977 is one example, and occurred at the time that theSchlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon was being prepared for publication. So,while the New Aeon insists that “the rituals of the old time are black,” (AL II:5) itappears that incorporation of elements from one of the oldest of old religions isexempt from this critique."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The surviving liturgies of ancient Egypt—the so-called Book of the Dead and theCoffin texts, for instance—are focused on the prime concern of the Egyptians: thesurvival of the individual identity after death. They are focused, therefore, on Osiriswho represents the totality of that meme: a dead (murdered) and resurrected god whoseexample promised immortality for human beings—a clear prototype of the Christianscheme that would appear thousands of years later. Horus, while an extremelyimportant player in these events and in his cosmic battle with Set, is not the focus ofhis own rite with the same intensity of purpose and elaboration of ritual as his father,Osiris ... at least, not in the surviving corpus of ancient Egyptian literature. If wecharacterize Aeons by their namesakes—the way the Gnostics did, and particularly theValentinians with their Aeon of Jesus, Aeon of Sophia, etc—then it stands to reasonthat there would be an Aeon of Horus. However, the rituals and form of worship aremissing, if they ever existed. (Imagine a cult of Saint Peter or Saint Paul, or even ofEmperor Constantine who legitimized the worship of Jesus in the Roman Empire.)Horus was part of the cult of Osiris, was integral to it. What Crowley's scripture seemsto indicate is that Horus is by now well and truly annoyed at this state of affairs and isintent on creating his own cultus, his own liturgies, his own heroic narrative.Furthermore, it is one that does not necessarily represent death and resurrection in theway we have all come to understand that concept but is another take on the humancondition entirely. It is a credit to the Egyptians that they were able to provide enoughraw material—real, imagined, or purely speculative based on bits and pieces ofmonuments, statues, and stelae—to fuel any dozen new religions, new approaches tospirituality, new techniques for becoming ... perfect.For comparison, we may reference the revelation received by Joseph Smith onanother Equinox of the Gods, the autumnal equinox of 1823 during which time hecaught a glimpse of the golden plates on which were inscribed, in “ReformedEgyptian”(!), the Book of Mormon. This scripture claimed it was the record of aJewish tribe that had escaped to North America at the time of the fall of Solomon'sTemple to the Babylonians. Joseph Smith was not Jewish and he did not pretend to beJewish. Smith, however, was a magician, and the discovery of the golden plates cameas the result of magical ceremonies conducted at that site by Smith using essentiallythe same rituals and the same texts that would form part of the Golden Dawncurriculum fifty years later. The revelation came in North America—upper New YorkState, to be precise—and not in Israel or in Egypt. The parallels with Crowley'srevelations could not be stronger: two Anglo-Saxon males—one born in America, theother in England, both magicians—receive spiritual revelations that command them toform new religious movements, yet neither are of the race ( Jewish or Egyptian) fromwhom the revelations are received, and both involve Egyptian texts. In Smith's case,the golden tablets were written in “Reformed Egyptian” (which does not exist), and inCrowley's case the revelations began with the discovery of a stele written in Egyptian"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"hieroglyphics (which had the obvious advantage of being written in genuine Egyptian).Prior to the Smith “discovery” there was another Egyptian discovery, this time bythe mysterious Count Cagliostro (1743-1795). Napoleon had invaded Egypt, and one ofthe earlier forms of the perennial Egypt craze had begun. In Cagliostro's case, itresulted in the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry. Cagliostro claimed to be able to initiateinto those mysteries and created his own Masonic lodges based on this “Egyptian”style, replete with ceremonial robes adorned with hieroglyphic embroidery. In the caseof both Joseph Smith and his precursor, Cagliostro, there was safety in the fact that noone knew how to translate Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Rosetta Stone (discovered in1799 and its code “broken” in 1822 at the earliest but not officially formalized untilyears later) had not yet yielded its treasures. People could say whatever they wishedabout the Egyptian writing and claim to be able to read and translate it.By the time Crowley appeared on the scene, however, Egyptian writing had beendecoded for eighty years and no one could claim special mystical knowledge abouttheir contents. Egyptology had become a scientific field of study involving the newdisciplines of linguistics, archaeology and anthropology, among others. Yet still theallure of the Egyptian religion remained, perhaps even stronger than before once it wasrevealed what all those hieroglyphics really said about gods, goddesses, rituals ofembalming and promises of eternal life.“Our method,” Crowley wrote, “is science; our aim is religion.”27 The translationsof the “Book of the Dead” by E. A. Wallis Budge (1895) and others only fueled thisparticular fire. Thus, while Crowley was a magician in the style of both Cagliostro andJoseph Smith, and claimed Masonic titles and lineages as did both of those men, hehad the benefit of access to genuine information about Egypt and Egyptian religiousbeliefs and practices. He was, in a sense, their apotheosis. He created a new religion—as did Smith—and a new occult order, as did Cagliostro.Of course, it did not begin and end with Egypt alone. Along the way, Crowleyincorporated much Asian religion into his new cult and was advised—specifically inthe Book of the Law—to include Afro-Caribbean rites and practices as well.28 ThisNew Aeon was to be all-inclusive and global in intellectual and spiritual reach. Is thisone reason why a young Englishman on his honeymoon in Cairo was selected for thisrevelation and its new scripture, and not a native Egyptian?An aspect of the Crowleyan Aeon of Horus that has not been the focus of muchattention is the fact that Crowley's scripture and its associated ideas are essentiallypagan, if by “pagan” we mean polytheist and even animist. The brunt of the attack ofthe Book of the Law against other religions is concentrated on two of the threeAbrahamic faiths: Christianity and Islam. Both Jesus and Mohammad are singled outfor blinding. Mary “inviolate” (by which we understand the mother of Jesus) is to betorn on a wheel. The flesh of Hindus, Buddhists, “Mongol and Din,” are to be torn out,but oddly not of their gods. (One imagines a list of all the Hindu gods to be blinded"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"would have taken too many pages.) Crowley assumes “Mongol” to representConfucianism,29 and “Din” by an even longer stretch to represent Judaism. His “NewCommentary” to the Book of the Law is explicit in his admiration for Islam as a manlyreligion, devoid of what he sees as the cringing, craven quality of a religion—Christianity—that is based on accepting the sacrifice of someone else for one's sins.But the blinding of Mohammad is as necessary as that of Jesus because both prophetshad the wrong “perspective.” He further claims that Hinduism “metaphysically andmystically comprehensive enough to assure itself the possession of much truth, is inpractice almost as superstitious and false as Christianity, a faith of slaves, liars anddastards. The same remarks apply roughly to Buddhism.” Thus two important pointsare made: Hinduism and Buddhism both possess “much truth,” but their practices arecorrupt. This enables Crowley to retain Hindu and Buddhist rituals, techniques, andterminology within his Thelemic framework—essentially looting a burning building.His general respect for Islam enabled him to refer in correspondence to his successorsas “Caliph,” a term—from the Arabic khalifah—that represents the successors to theProphet. Indeed, the initiation rituals of the OTO in the lower degrees use an Arabframework from the Crusader era as the template for the rites, much the way theGolden Dawn used an Egyptian temple motif. Thus, the Book of the Law seems toreserve its strongest opprobrium for Christianity: the religion in which Crowley wasraised and which he despised for most of his life.Another potential conflict arises, though, when one considers that the organizationat the forefront of Thelema is the Ordo Templi Orientis, or Order of the EasternTemple, an order identifying itself with the Knights Templar. The Templars were, ofcourse, a Roman Catholic religious and military organization devoted to the capture ofthe Holy Land from Islamic control. One might think that this represents someaccommodation with Christianity in a Thelemic context, but one would be mistaken.For the mythology of the Knights Templar characterizes it as a secret society withmystical elements that found itself opposed to mainstream Christianity and which,indeed, was suppressed by the Catholic Church in the fourteenth century, its famousGrand Master—Jacques de Molay—burned at the stake on false charges of heresy.Thus, identifying with the Templars does not make one a Christian in any normativesense of the word, and this would have appealed to Crowley as well as the libelassociated with the Templars, that they engaged in deviant sexual practices as well asidol-worship. Crowley took as his Order name the word Baphomet, which wassupposedly the name of the (non-Christian) idol that the Templars worshipped. Whilemuch scholarship recently has thrown many of these assumptions about the Order intoserious doubt, the association of Templarism with the mysterious Orient of theSaracens, as well as with sexual mysticism, is the idea with which Thelema mostclosely identifies.Since the Aeon of Horus is focused on individual responsibility and freedom—"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"where “Every man and every woman is a star”—it stands to reason that its greatest foewould be Christianity, at least the Christianity as understood by Crowley himself, afaith of “slaves, liars and dastards.” Indeed, as the “Beast 666” Crowley set himself infirm opposition to the organized Church by identifying with its Apocalyptic enemy andclaiming as his bride the Whore of Babylon (in Crowley's numerology renamed“Babalon”). The anti-Christianity of Crowley is obsessive, and one wonders why heeven bothered. The Book of the Law has an Egyptian framework and motif; it wasreceived in Cairo, during sessions surrounded by the cry of the muezzin from theminarets of the city's fabled mosques. Why bother bringing up Christianity at all, muchless incorporating some of its elements into the Thelemic gestalt? Because, toCrowley's way of thinking, Christianity represented the old and now discredited Aeonof Osiris par excellence. For such a well-traveled and intelligent man, it seems oddthat he would think that way considering that most of the world—especially the worldhe traveled in, Asia and the Middle East—was not Christian and never had beenChristian. How was the Aeon of Osiris represented in China, for instance? Or in India?This may seem like nit-picking to some, but it goes to the heart of an importantpoint, one that forms the essence of the Grant-Lovecraft theme that we will take upshortly. Crowley's interpretation of the Book of the Law could be described as—if notEurocentric then—Occident-centric. It focuses almost exclusively on western ideasabout religion and spirituality, and especially on resisting any form of Christianity. Itis a kind of spiritual colonialism: the ransacking of Asian religions and practices foranything of value to a system that is almost wholly focused on defeating a westernobsession with sin, restriction, and the cupidity of its priests. It is quite similar to theanxiety some in the west feel over the prophecies of Nostradamus and the Mayancalendar, signalling the End of Days and an Armageddon-like final conflict. There isno such sense of this in the East. There is no such anxiety there. Their calendars aredifferent, their religious context entirely dissimilar, their fear of an Anti-Christ non-existent. The end of the world that the west fears so much may be just that: the end ofthe western world as we know it, but not of “the world” ... not the “whole enchilada.”For the Aeon of Horus to be an Aeon for all it needs to respond to all, to theanxieties of all and to the desperation of all. It has to make as much sense in Beijing asin Boston, in Jakarta as in Jersey City, in Tokyo as in Tunbridge Wells. In Chennai asin Chicago.The importance of the Kenneth Grant material, therefore, lies in his attempt tocreate a more global character for Thelema by incorporating as much Afro-Caribbeanand Asian elements in far more detail and with much greater insight than was availablein the Crowley writings. In some cases, this meant taking the work of former Crowleycolleagues and initiates far more seriously than had been done previously. It alsomeant that Grant would delve into the darker aspects of Thelema and of what Thelemawas insinuating: that at the heart of the cultus was an acknowledgement of humanity's"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"more sinister roots, roots that went back to pre-Dynastic Egypt and even further, to theoldest civilization for which we have any texts at all: Sumer. Crowley's writingsassumed that his readers already had a strong background in comparative religion, therituals of the Golden Dawn, and the Kabbalah. In fact, today we have far greater accessto this material than Crowley did. We have the ability to develop the basic themes ofThelema in much greater depth and with a wider scope. Grant was the first proponentof Thelema to recognize this, and while many Thelemites find his writings eitherobscure, or heretical, or both, his research and his dedication cannot be denied.One of Grant's fixations concerns one of Crowley's most famous disciples andcritics. While Crowley believed himself to be the prophet of this new, post-patriarchalAge, the Aeon of Horus, one of his followers went on to proclaim yet another Aeon,one that began only forty-four years after the start of the Aeon of Horus.This was Charles Stansfeld Jones (1886-1950)—known as Frater Achad—and hisAeon was proclaimed the Aeon of Maat or sometimes Ma-Ion. At first glance, thiswould seem to be an inconsistency if not an impossibility. How could a new Aeonbegin when the last one—Crowley's Aeon of Horus—had hardly begun? Yet, as we willsoon discover, this concept does have precedents."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Ma-IonAs mentioned, Jones was one of Crowley's most important disciples and followers, aman who Crowley once claimed was his “magical son,” but who nevertheless brokewith Crowley on several points of doctrine and who became a convert to RomanCatholicism, thus abandoning Thelema entirely.According to Jones—known under a variety of occult names and mottoes but mostfamously as Frater Achad (“achad” being the Hebrew word for “one”)—a new Aeonbegan on April 2, 1948 which he called the Aeon of Maat. This would be an era ofpeace and love, a kind of counterpoint to Crowley's Aeon of Horus which ischaracterized as the era of the Crowned and Conquering Child, a somewhat morewarlike image.Achad's Aeon of Maat was named after the Egyptian goddess of the Balance. Theweight of the human heart after death was measured against a single feather of Maat'sheadress. If the heart weighed more than the feather, the soul was doomed to anunpleasant afterlife. Thus, Maat symbolized Justice as well as Equilibrium. One couldsay with some justification that Maat was a more likely icon of the “Age of Aquarius”than a warlike Horus, but that depends on how one views an implacable force ofJustice!The problem with the Maat proposal is that one does not know with any certaintyhow long a Crowleyan Aeon is supposed to last. If one takes the traditional Westernview, an Aeon is roughly equivalent to an astrological Age which corresponds to thelength of time it takes for the Sun's passage through the vernal equinoctial point in oneof the zodiacal signs, a process known to astronomers as the precession of theequinoxes. The precession of the equinoxes takes a total of 25,800 years; thus, thelength of time of each Age—corresponding to one of the 12 zodiacal signs—is about2,150 years. This idea that the Age corresponds to the equinoctial point is reflected inmany Thelemic writings and rituals, such as the title of Crowley's own occultmagazine, The Equinox, and his commentary on Liber AL, The Equinox of the Gods.However, Crowley postulated that the Aeon of Horus began in 1904—the year hereceived the Book of the Law. The problem with this date is that it is not consistentwith the scientific calculation of some astronomers regarding the Age of Aquarius.They declare it will not actually begin until about 2600 CE. On the other hand, manyastrologers and occultists believe otherwise—proposing start dates ranging from thefifteenth century CE to a thousand years from now. In this cluttered field, Crowley's“Aeon of Horus” is only one among many contenders for the title of “current Age” andas such is perhaps just as valid as any other.But how long does a Crowleyan Aeon last?This is also a contentious area, for Crowley himself was not clear or consistent inhis calculations. While he seemed inclined to accept the standard precessional length"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"of time of 2,000 to 2,150 years he was not committed to it. How could he be, when a1904 start date was inconsistent with both astronomical and astrological literature? Inhis various writings he admitted the possibility that an Aeon could be measured in aslittle as a hundred years or as many as thousands of years, stipulating that theexperience of Time by the gods was not identical to human conceptions.30 Thus, whenFrater Achad proclaimed the Aeon of Maat as beginning only forty-four years after thebeginning of the (presumably 2,150 year long) Aeon of Horus, there theoretically wassome wiggle-room for insisting on such a shortened “Aeon.” Crowley's adoption of theprecessional idea of the Aeons or Ages seems pro forma, as if he accepted the 2,150year “age” as a given rather than basing it on any specific revelation or calculation onhis part, the way he accepted the matriarchal-patriarchal sequence long sinceabandoned by scholars. It is obvious to even the most cursory examination that twothousand years prior to 1904—i.e. the year 96 BCE—could not have been the beginningof the patriarchal Age of Osiris. The worship of Osiris had predated this period bythousands of years; further, the two thousand years prior to 96 BCE could by no stretchof the imagination be considered a matriarchal age.31This was not Achad's only creative adjustment to the Kabbalistic system embracedby Crowley. He also went on to redesign the Tree of Life and to assign differentvariables to the spheres and to the paths on the Tree that connect the spheres. This typeof tinkering could have important and far-reaching consequences for those brought upunder the Golden Dawn, AA and OTO systems for it rendered all sorts of symboliclanguage inoperative and inoperable.The Tree of Life is the primary template for the magical system that came out of theGolden Dawn. The initiatory degrees are based on the spheres of the Tree, and thecorresponding instructions in magic, kabbalah, astrology, Tarot, etc are all related tothe paths that connect the spheres. Thus, any re-arranging of this scheme would beanathema and would possibly question the occult attainments (or at least their analysisand interpretation) of those who had already passed through the degree system to anyextent. This would include Crowley himself, of course. Achad was aware of thisproblem, and mentioned it briefly in the Preface to his The Egyptian Revival.One great Authority, however, while admitting that many of the ideas arebrilliant, says that he cannot accept this Reformed Order in the face of severalhundred years of the old tradition, and maintains that the previous arrangementis the correct one.While I realize that great changes in the recognized Systems of Initiation incertain Orders might be necessary if the Reformed Order of the Paths wereadopted, and while recognizing the importance of the Authority mentionedabove, I still maintain that this New Arrangement is worthy of the most carefulconsideration and study.32"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Thus, what Achad was doing was redesigning an entire occult system that had takenyears to produce and fine-tune, and in which hundreds of people had already beeninitiated and trained. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, of course, for theGolden Dawn system itself was a novel approach towards uniting a great many occultideas into one comprehensive methodology with a flexible and internally-consistentmagical vocabulary. Even the idea of assigning the twenty-two Tarot Trumps to thetwenty-two paths on the Tree of Life (corresponding to the twenty-two letters of theHebrew alphabet) was no older than the nineteenth century, a legacy of the Frenchoccultist Eliphas Levi (of whom Crowley believed himself to be the reincarnation).The power and sheer beauty of that system to anyone who previously had spent yearsporing over the grimoires and other medieval instruction books on magic is obvious.Achad's ambition was to supplant that older framework: after all, it had been createddecades before the Book of the Law revelation and thus could be consideredinoperative in the Aeon of Horus.This extended, evidently, even to the arrangement and chronology of the Aeonsthemselves. This type of creative interpretation of Crowley's ouevre—includingvarious approaches to the Book of the Law—infuriated Crowley, and prompted him toissue a famous “Comment” on the Book of the Law in November, 1925 from his then-current base in Tunis in which he forbade completely any open discussion of the Bookor its contents. He demanded that he and his writings be regarded as the soleauthorities, and that each person should have recourse only to those two sources and tono other. (Of course, with Crowley's death in 1947, one of those two sources wasrendered unavailable.)So how could Achad's system be consistent in any way with that so painstakinglycreated by the Golden Dawn and developed further by Aleister Crowley, one of theGolden Dawn's most famous initiates? This question becomes more important onceone realizes that Crowley considered Achad his “magical son,” the one prophesied inthe Book of the Law.33 There have been a number of possible solutions put forward bydefenders of Achad, but defending Achad is a thankless task. Aside from Grant and hisfollowers, there has been very little interest in Achad's writings and theories frommainstream Thelemites. Achad is considered a heretic in the Crowley world, but beforehe went off the reservation he did make several important contributions to Thelemaincluding an important “decoding” of a significant element of the Book of the Law,which is why he was anointed as Crowley's magical son.Obviously, the most glaring challenge to Crowley's system was the inauguration ofthe Aeon of Maat in 1948, just five months after Crowley's death and two years beforeAchad's own demise. To a literal-minded observer, Achad's insistence on a new Aeonso soon after the birth of the previous one seems insane. Yet, the nature of Aeons issuch that there is a precedent for Aeons running concurrently and the proof of this is inthe Gnostic, Hindu and Kabbalistic traditions so beloved of Crowley himself."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"In the first place, according to Valentinian Gnostic belief, the Aeons were created inmale/female pairs, called syzygies. Thus every male Aeon had a female counterpart, aconsort or spouse. Again, we must be clear that we are speaking of Aeons as divineemanations and not necessarily as lengths of time. However, the Egyptian Aeons asunderstood by Crowley were also divine emanations. They were, in fact, gods. WhatAchad did was to include the Aeon of Maat as a kind of “sister” or “spouse” of theAeon of Horus, according to some commentators. While this seems at odds withCrowley's own writings on the subject it is nonetheless consistent with the GnosticAeons. Why should this matter? Because the main vehicle for regular Thelemicworship is something Crowley created called the Gnostic Mass.Gnosticism is understood by many to be a mystical form of Christianity,incorporating many pagan and Greco-Egyptian elements. It is an “initiated” form ofthe religion, and Valentinian Gnosticism in particular fits this description quitecapably. Crowley's development of the Gnostic Mass—based, he claimed, on a DivineLiturgy he witnessed in Moscow34—and its regular celebration by his Gnostic CatholicChurch would seem to imply that he approved of Gnosticism, at least in some forms.The theme of the Aeons is central to most Gnostic writings, and he would have beenfamiliar with the condemnations of it by the early Church Fathers (which fact alonewould have made it attractive to Crowley).In fact, the Gnostic teachings include a creation of the world through the illegitimatesexual desires of the last and youngest of the thirty Aeons, Sophia. It is this sameSophia that is called in some Gnostic texts “the Whore.” In different versions of themyth, Sophia is either without a consort—that is, not a member of a syzygy—orabandons her consort in the search for God the Father. She learns that the UnbegottenOne has Himself begotten the Pleroma (the rarified spiritual realm where all the Aeonsreside), and she wishes to imitate him by producing an offspring herself, withoutbenefit of intercourse. This she does, but it is a monster: in some texts described as an“abortion” or as a “miscarriage.” In others as simply “the Void of Knowledge” and“the Shadow of the Name.” It is her illicit desire to become a God that results in thecreation of Anger, Fear, Despair and other negative impulses which in turn create theworld as we know it.In another version of the story—mentioned above—Sophia falls far and fast fromgrace and is nearly out of reach of the other Aeons until she comes up against the Limit(horos) and is saved. The Limit stands between the Pleroma—the fullness of God—andthe outer darkness. She then becomes reunited with her Aeon and the Pleroma is rightagain. The problem is, however, that her unholy Intention caused a tremor in thePleroma and it together with her Passion is cast into the outer darkness, i.e., thePleroma rejects this new creature and it becomes the infamous “abortion” or“miscarriage” mentioned above, a “formless entity” that requires that the Limit beerected in order to keep it away from the Pleroma, and to preserve the Pleroma from its"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"polluting aspect. It is this entity that becomes the created world.Eventually—according to the Valentinian Gnosis—the other Aeons become worriedover their newly-perceived vulnerability. In order to quiet the Aeons and restore somesense of harmony and stability, two new Aeons are created: Christos (male) and theHoly Spirit (female). Christos has the advantage of being able to operate on both sidesof the Limit, both in the Pleroma and in the outer darkness. Eventually, the Aeon ofJesus is formed and this Aeon functions solely outside of the Pleroma.It is interesting that the two qualities that cause the Limit to be erected in the firstplace are precisely Intention and Passion, corollaries of Will and Love, the twodetermining qualities of the Thelemic system.35 Thus, as Kenneth Grant will laterexpound, there is an ontological link between the beliefs of Thelema concerning Willand Love on the one hand, and with the Outer Darkness on the other. And in the middleof them stand Sophia (the Whore) and the Limit (Horos, vide Horus).These Aeons all run simultaneously, i.e., they are divine emanations and as suchhave no beginning or end save in the mind of God. There is a chronology which beginswith an Ogdoad (an initial group of eight Aeons) and which is then augmented by tenAeons and then twelve additional Aeons for the total of thirty original Aeons, thussuggesting a kind of sequential order but with no fixed length of time involved and,anyway, these Aeons exist in the Pleroma and are inaccessible by mere mortals. TheAeons of Christos and Jesus, however, do impact directly on the created world—theworld formed from the monstrous stillbirth of Sophia. This world, composed ofnegative elements from Sophia's reckless quest for equality with God, is in need ofAeonic assistance and that is why—according to the Valentinians—Christos, the HolySpirit, and Jesus were formed in order to bring order into the realm beyond thePleroma.A complete discussion of the Gnostic Aeons is far beyond the scope of this book andinterested readers are urged to consult any of the standard works on Gnosticism,perhaps starting with Hans Jonas and his The Gnostic Religion, which covers theValentinian Gnosis in some detail. There has been much new work done on theValentinians (and other Gnostic groups) since the Jonas book was first published butaccess to a good university library or database is usually required. There will be furtherdiscussion of the Aeons in the chapters that follow, but they will be based on theinformation already given.What we should take away from this chapter, however, is the fact that the Gnosticswere the first to talk about Aeons in an esoteric sense, and to do so in a very detailedand complex manner reminiscent of the later books of the Jewish mystics andparticularly of the Kabbalah. The Gnostics understood the Aeons in both senses of alength of time that may not be measurable in human terms, and as the emanation of aparticular deity or divine characteristic. To apply this reasoning to the Crowleyan Aeonof Horus we may say—in the spirit of Gnosticism—that such an Aeon would have the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"characteristics of Horus (however they may be described) as well as a specific (butprobably unknowable) length of time or chronology. And, most importantly, from thebest available data on record we know that while the Gnostic Aeons were created in akind of chronological order, in the end they all ran concurrently. They all existed at thesame time and not in any kind of consecutive order with one ending as another began.This could be applied to the debate over the Aeon of Horus versus the Aeon of Maat;there does not need to be a “versus” at all.But if that alone was not enough to allow an Aeon of Maat to run concurrently withthe Aeon of Horus, there was yet another option.In the Indian system of yugas or great ages we are told that they sometimes“overlapped” as in this citation from the Bhagavata-purana:Suta Gosvami said: when the second yuga overlapped the third, the great sage[Vyasadeva] was born to Parasara in the womb of Satyavati, the daughter ofVasu.” (Bhagavata-purana, 1.4.14)Thus there is a precedent, even in Hinduism, for overlapping yugas so why not foroverlapping Aeons, their cognates? To be sure there are several different calculationsfor the lengths of the respective yugas; yet this implies (a) they are not based on theprecession of the equinoxes through the astrological signs which most experts agreeare of regular length and (b) that the yuga of one system will necessarily overlap theyuga of another, which is not a bad thing, but which gives rise to further calculationsand refinements of the chronological system. And, according to the citation above,great things can happen when yugas (or Aeons) overlap.The final approach that could be taken with respect to the Aeons is a purelyKabbalistic one, but one of which Crowley does not seem to have been aware. Thissystem is elaborated in the Sefer ha-Temunah or the “Book of the Image,” a text that isusually dated to the thirteenth century. The “image” of the title refers to the shape ofthe Hebrew letters which were believed to contain certain secrets. For our purposes,however, the other value of the book is in its discussion of the shemittot (sing.shemitta) the “cosmic cycles” of the encoded Torah.Years were counted in multiples of seven, which were themselves multiplied byseven, so that a cycle consisted of 7 x 7 years or 49 years in total. The next year—thefiftieth year—was a “jubilee” year, a year in which the sins and errors of the previous49 years were erased and the slate cleaned and the cycle begun anew.36 This was onecycle, or shemitta.Using this framework as a starting point, Bible and Kabbalah scholars have tried toascertain the age of the universe. Each cycle of 7,000 (7 x 20 x 50) years is considereda Kabbalistic “age” and is related to one of the seven lower sefirot on the Tree of Life.The number 7,000 comes from a line in the Talmud37 that states the world will existfor 6,000 years and that for the 1,000 years thereafter it shall be “desolate.” According"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"to some Kabbalists we are living in the second age, that of Gevurah or “Severity.”Using the Jubilee formula, then, 7,000 years times 7 would equal 49,000 years whichwould be the age of the universe. If we are living in the second cycle, that would implythat Adam was created somewhere around 7,000 years ago (depending on where we arein the second cycle, the beginning, middle, or the end).However, using a citation from the Midrash, “A thousand years in your sight are butas yesterday” it is indicated that a thousand human years equals only one Divine day,thus the ensuing calculations would reveal an age of the universe as something closerto 15 billion years (if we are living in the last Kabbalistic age) which—coincidentally—matches the latest scientific estimates of the age of the universe.There are two implications pertinent to this study that can be found in the Sefer ha-Temunah. The first is that Kabbalistic ages can be identified by a series of sefiroticreferences. Thus, the very first year of the cycle is named after Chesed—the first of theseven sefirot below the Abyss on the Tree of Life and the only ones used for thesecalculations by the rabbis—which also gives its name to the entire first cycle of 7,000years, and that the second year would be Gevurah, then Tiferet, etc. Thus, year two isthe year Gevurah of the greater cycle year Chesed. But, of course, the interlocking agesdo not end there and can be continued indefinitely down to the smallest unit of time.This system is mirrored in the table of astrological hours used by ceremonialmagicians, in which the first hour of Sunday—for instance—would be the hour of theSun, the first hour of Monday would be the hour of the Moon, and so on for the sevendays and the seven philosophical planets. These planetary hours are equivalent to thesefirotic attributes, for Chesed is considered the sphere of Jupiter (and hence ofThursday), Gevurah of Mars (and Tuesday), Tiferet of the Sun (and Sunday), etc. Onecould then just as easily take the magician's astrological hours and expand them toinclude years, multiples of years, etc. to arrive at corresponding planetary Aeons.The point of this exercise is that time periods have subsets, and that these subsetshave the same qualities as the various time periods themselves albeit withmodifications. For example, the period Sun in the greater period Saturn (for instance)would not have the same quality of action as the period Saturn in the greater periodSaturn, or the period Saturn in the greater period Sun. This system is actually used byVedic (Indian) astrologers in their calculation method known as antardasas.Using this as a theory, could there be an Aeon of Maat within the greater Aeon ofHorus, as a subset of Horus?As complicated—perhaps unnecessarily complicated—as all this sounds, we shouldbe reminded of a statement by Crowley himself, when he writes:...Aiwass, uttering the word Thelema (with all its implications), destroyscompletely the formula of the Dying God. Thelema implies not merely a newreligion, but a new cosmology, a new philosophy, a new ethics. It co-ordinates"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"the disconnected discoveries of science, from physics to psychology, into acoherent and consistent system. Its scope is so vast that it is impossible even tohint at the universality of its application. But the whole of my work, from themoment of its utterance, illustrates some phase of its potentiality, and the storyof my life itself from this time on is no more than a record of my reactions toit.38Thus, a new cosmology is required, and it is entirely possible that this newcosmology would have at its heart a re-interpretation of all that has been writtenconcerning the Aeons: their nature, their number, their chronological order, and theirperiods of time. One stands in awe at the scope of Crowley's project for this New Aeon,and at the same time one measures it against the words of one of his contemporaries:The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little;but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up suchterrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shalleither go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peaceand safety of a new dark age.39Thus, Lovecraft himself was aware of the possibility of uniting the same sciences—Crowley's “disconnected discoveries” and Love-craft's “dissociated knowledge”—andwas terrified that it would one day occur, and that the Aeon of Horus would become a“new dark age.”Which leads us to the second implication contained within the Sefer ha-Temunahand in the deliberations of its sages: the idea that the world has already been createdand destroyed several times over. The seventh 1,000 year period of each cycle is a timeof “desolation” in which all life of the previous 6,000 years is wiped out. Depending onwhere we are in the great scheme of things—with experts offering opinions anywherefrom the second cycle to the seventh—the world may have been destroyed at leastonce, and as many as six times already. This gives rise to the possibility that the 2,000year cycle known to the astrologers could be replaced by the 7,000 year cycle known tothe Kabbalists, meaning that the Aeon of Osiris (which ended, according to Crowley, in1904) actually began in 5,096 BCE, and that the Aeon of Isis began in 12,096 BCE. Usingthese somewhat larger values gives us the historic coordination we need, for 5,096 BCEplaces us much earlier than pre-Dynastic Egypt and allows for the possibility that anAeon of Osiris began at that time, and that there was a pre-historic matriarchal agebeginning in 12,096 BCE for which there is no written record but for whichcircumstantial evidence in the form of goddess statues and the like may be offered tosupport it.40In any event, the Typhonian understanding of the Aeons is much closer to theGnostic concept. Each Aeon is an emanation, a manifestation of a particular God, and"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"they all exist concurrently as separate forms of awareness, of consciousness. One couldgo to great lengths to try to “prove” Achad's system—the above few paragraphs givean idea as to how much calculation and speculation would be involved—but to Grantthis is not necessary. The mere fact that we have imagined an Aeon of Maat issufficient to claim its existence. To adhere to the idea of the Aeon of Horus as beingexclusive to this time and place ignores the essential nature of the gods themselves asbeing beyond all considerations of space and time. If a middle-aged white man can sitin an ashram in Goa and commune with Kali, or a teen-aged girl can stand naked in acircle and draw down the Moon, then it is probably safe to say that Maat can beapproached and her influence experienced in the present Age.Grant's anxiety—as expressed in Nightside of Eden and in his other works—is thatthe Earth is being infiltrated by a race of extraterrestrial beings who will causetremendous changes to take place in our world. This statement is not to be taken quiteas literally as it appears, for the “Earth” can be taken to mean our current level ofconscious awareness, and extraterrestrial would mean simply “not of this current levelof conscious awareness.” But the potential for danger is there, and Grant's work—likeLovecraft's—is an attempt to warn us of the impending (potentially dramatic)alterations in our physical, mental and emotional states due to powerful influencesfrom “outside.” This “extraterrestrial” race has already been here, already made itselfknown (and hence the antiquity of the Typhonian Tradition, according to Grant), and isreturning to the planet in greater numbers than before and with an agenda that only theadepts would be able to divine. This concept is emphasized in the Schlangekraftrecension of the Necronomicon, where it is stated:...for thou can never know the Seasons of Times of the Ancient Ones, eventhough thou can tell their Seasons upon the Earth by the rules I have alreadyinstructed thee to compute; for their Times and Seasons Outside run uneven andstrange to our minds, for are they not the Computors of All Time? Did They notset Time in its Place?41Thus, once again it can be shown that the Necronomicon, Crowley, and Grant are inagreement on certain specific points of interest concerning the advent of the NewAeon. The idea that the human race is not the first on the planet is one that has beenpicked up and developed into an entire mythos by H. P. Lovecraft and expanded uponby Kenneth Grant. It is linked to the Lovecraftian idea of the Great Old Ones, gods—oralien creatures, or both—who came to the earth in “aeons past” and who will returnagain. The recurring of the Aeon of the Great Old Ones is cognate with Crowley'srecurring Aeons of the Egyptian gods. It is also connected to another Lovecraftiantheme, the idea that there are people on earth who are in secret communication, usuallytelepathically but also through ritual, with the Great Old Ones and are preparing theway for their return."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Let my servants be few & secret: they shall rule the many & the known.424 Geraldine Pinch, Egyptian Myth: A very short introduction, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 52.5 A ritual that was conducted between January 14 to June 16, 1918 by Crowley and a number of others, butmostly including Roddie Minor, known as Soror Achitha 555. It should be noted that 555 is the number mostclosely associated with the Necronomicon, as it is the value of the word in its original Greek. Grant associates thisnumber with the Necronomicon Current, just as 666 is identified with the Thelemic Current.6 For instance, AL I:7: “Behold! it is revealed by Aiwass the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat.” AL II:8, “Whoworshipped Heru-pa-kraath have worshipped me; ill, for I am the worshipper,” and AL III:35, “The half of theword of Heru-ra-ha, called Hoor-pa-kraat and Ra-Hoor-Khut.” Hoor-pa-kraat and Heru-pa-kraath are bothoriginal Egyptian forms of the later Greek Harpocrates. The name also figures prominently in the initiation ritualsof the Golden Dawn.7 See, for instance, Aleister Crowley, The Equinox of the Gods, Chapter 8: “This child Horus is a twin, two in one.Horus and Harpocrates are one, and they are also one with Set or Apophis, the destroyer of Osiris. It is by thedestruction of the principle of death that they are born.”8 See for instance his statement linking Aiwass with the Shaitan of the Yezidi: “Aiwaz is not a mere formula, likemany Angelic names, but it is the true, most ancient name of the God of the Yezidi, and thus returns to the highestantiquity. Our work is therefore historically authentic; the rediscovery of the Sumerian tradition.” In KennethGrant, The Magical Revival, Friedrich Muller, London, 1972, p. 529 The Great Bear constellation figures prominently in both the Schlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon andin Kenneth Grant's work. The importance of this constellation—often neglected by western occultists—is detailedin the author's own Stairway to Heaven: Chinese Alchemists, Jewish Kabbalists and the Art of SpiritualTransformation.10 See the author's trilogy, Sinister Forces: Agrimoire of American political witchcraft (Trine Day, Walterville(OR), 2005, 2011) in particular volume 3, chapter 17: “Voluntary Madness,” for a more detailed explanation ofthis connection.11 See, for instance, The Equinox of the Gods: “I lay claim to be the sole authority competent to decide disputedpoints with regard to the Book of the Law, seeing that its Author, Aiwaz, is none other than mine own HolyGuardian Angel, to Whose Knowledge and Conversation I have attained, so that I have exclusive access to Him. Ihave duly referred every difficulty to Him directly, and received His answer; my award is therefore absolutewithout appeal.”12 “I now incline to believe that Aiwass is not only the God or Demon or Devil once held holy in Sumer, and mineown Guardian Angel, but also a man as I am, insofar as He uses a human body to make His magical link withMankind, whom He loves, and that He is thus an Ipsissimus, the Head of the AA” Ibid.13 See The Master Plan by Heather Pringle, or the author's own Unholy Alliance and Ratline for more details onthe anthropological fantasies of the Nazis.14 “Isa” is the Arabic form of the name “Jesus,” and thus “Isa the sufferer” is an apt description but may not bewhat the Speaker intended. The Golden Dawn mudra for Isis specifically refers to her as “mourning,” and thecharacteristic of the Book of the Law is overwhelmingly Egyptian. While Crowley believed that Isa was areference to Jesus, it is possible that he is mistaken in this regard. It should also be noted that the preferredpronounciation of “Isis” is “ee-set” or “ee-sa.”15 Aleister Crowley, Confessions, p. 39916 The number fifteen is suggestive. Grant understands it to be the number of female secretions known as kalas,which will be discussed later. Taken as a male/female pair, however, we are at the point of understanding thecentral secret of the OTO as well as of western esotericism generally.17 Cf: Liber AL I:29 “For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union” for a Thelemite analogue. In thiscase the speaker is the goddess Nuit.18 From the Greek horothetes, the “giver of limit.” Had it been Aramaic, however, the word horos would imply"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"“father” as in hor, horah. There is some dispute on this issue. But it becomes more interesting in light of the factthat Crowley—in at least one place—confuses the Aeon of the Father with the Son. In his Confessions, in a chapterentitled “The Historical Conception on Which the Book of the Law is Based” he writes: “To recapitulate thehistorical basis of The Book of the Law, let me say that evolution (within human memory) shows three great steps:(1) the worship of the Mother, continually breeding by her own virtue; (2) the worship of the Son, reproducinghimself by virtue of voluntary death and resurrection; (3) the worship of the Crowned and Conquering Child (theAeon announced by Aiwass and implied in His Word, Thelema.” (Reproduced in Aleister Crowley, Magick, p.703) In this case Crowley has once again emphasized the now-disproven chronology of matriarchy-patriarchy, butmore importantly he states that the Aeon of Osiris was the Aeon of the Son (i.e., of Jesus and other slain gods;Osiris may be considered in the same category of dead and resurrected god, but in what way can Osiris beconsidered a “son”?). The concept of patriarchy would seem to have been replaced—in at least this single instancein Crowley's published work—by a filiarchy.19 Mordechai Gilula, “An Egyptian Etymology of the Name of Horus” in the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, p.259, Vol. 68. (1982), pp. 259—26520 Kenneth Grant, Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God, Friedrich Muller, London, 1973.21 See Victor Turner, The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-structure. Aldine, Chicago, 196922 The number is interesting, and recalls the number of the Stations of the Cross in Roman Catholic churcheswhich always number fourteen and which represent the crucifixion, i.e., a slain God.23 This episode is discussed more fully in the author's Tantric Temples: Eros and Magic in Java, Ibis Press, LakeWorth (FL), 2011. For a more Crowleyan context, one should refer to his notes on The Paris Working (a series ofoccult rituals devoted to Jupiter which took place in that city from Dec 31, 1913 to Feb. 12, 1914) in which hewrites: “The name of this Phallus is Thoth, Hermes or Ma. Ma is the god who seduced the Phallus away from theYoni; hence the physical Universe. All worlds are excreta; they represent wasted semen.”24 A word which, incidentally, means “spilled seed.”25 This world has given some newcomers to Thelema a headache, for it seems it can be found nowhere elseexcept in Crowley's work. A tour through the usual search engines shows up nothing. However, the term Themaistappears in the Golden Dawn rituals with some associated detail, and in several different forms, thus illustratingonce more how essential it is for an understanding of Thelema and Crowley's ouevre to have access to the GoldenDawn material as a basis. See for instance Israel Regardie, The Golden Dawn, St Paul, Llewellyn, p. 339 “TheEnterer of the Threshold”: “Before the Face of the Gods in the ‘Place of the Threshold' is the name of Hegemon,and She is the Goddess Thma-Ae-St having the following Coptic forms: Thma-Ae-St ... Thma-aesh ... Thmaa-ett...”etc., and for the same names written in Coptic script, see p. 352 Ibid. On page 375 of the same work we find fourdifferent versions of the name Thma-Est (this time) associated with the four letters of the Divine Name, YHVHwith the further clarification “In the Equinox ceremony, the Hegemon in Air, Spirit, and the principal officer. Shereconciles from East to West, and from North to South, and in a circular formulae.”26 Leaders of Egypt's Salafi party as well as some more extreme members of the Muslim Brotherhood, who beganthe call after the election of a Muslim Brotherhood candidate to the Egyptian presidency after the ouster of HosniMubarrak in 2012.27 The slogan “The Method of Science—The Aim of Religion” appears on the title page of every volume ofCrowley's occult periodical, The Equinox.28 AL I:37: “Also the mantras and spells; the obeah and the wanga; the work of the wand and the work of thesword; these he shall learn and teach.” The terms obeah and wanga refer explicitly to Afro-Caribbean religions.This is a theme that was picked up and expanded by Grant in association with Michel Bertiaux, a Chicago-basedmagician who developed a system of magic out of elements of Haitian voudon. This will be discussed in greaterdetail in the chapters that follow. Crowley had access to some of this material through his friendship with theauthor and adventurer William Seabrook, but seems not to have made use of it. His interpretations of these wordsas published in his New Commentary are wholly implausible and ignore their obvious Afro-Caribbean meanings.Why?29 Confucius (551-479 BCE) was not a Mongol, but a Han Chinese of Shandong Province. “Mongol” may be a"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"reference to the religion of the Mongolians which was an indigenous religion known as Tengriism (the worship ofthe Mongolian deity Tengri). One will find elements of Buddhism, shamanism, and even Islam among theMongols at various times. But at the time the Book of the Law was written, most Mongols were Buddhists and hadbeen for centuries; alongside their indigenous religion of Tengriism which was already dying out and would begradually replaced by atheism, introduced by the Chinese at the time of the Communist revolution. Thus, there isno legitimate way to connect Confucius with the term Mongol. “Din” is an even more difficult reference. Crowleyattempts to connect it to Judaism—the Hebrew word din meaning “judgment”—but the attribution is unworthy ofhim, as “Din” in this context is clearly referring to another race, i.e., “Mongol and Din.” Another option is toassume that he heard the phrase incorrectly, and that “Mongol and Din” was really “Mongol ad-Din.”Ad-Din is anArabic term for “of the faith,” and in this context the entire line may be read as “With my claws I tear out the fleshof the Indian and the Buddhist, Mongol ad-Din” or “... the flesh of the Indian and the Buddhist Mongol of theFaith.” As the Mongols were Buddhists, it may be a reference to a specific cultus or a specific personage within thecultus. There were several Muslim military leaders with the surname “ad-Din” and “al-Din” who fought theMongols during various invasions. This is, however, a fanciful suggestion but is more logical than assuming “Din”is a reference to the Jews. Even the Islamic leader prominent in Templar lore was named Saladin, which is aEuropeanization of the name Salah ad-Din..30 For instance, in the “Old Comment” to The Book of the Law in The Equinox, volume 1 number VII: “Followinghim will arise the Equinox of Ma, the Goddess of Justice, it may be a hundred or ten thousand years from now; forthe Computation of Time is not here as There.” He further explains this in his Confessions when he writes, “I maynow point out that the reign of the Crowned and Conquering Child is limited in time by The Book of the Law itself.We learn that Horus will be in his turn succeeded by Thmaist, the Double-Wanded One; she who shall bring thecandidates to full initiation, and though we know little of her peculiar characteristics, we know at least that hername is justice.” p. 399. (Thmaist is a variant of Maat used by the Golden Dawn and not found elsewhere,presumably a conflation of Themis—the Greek goddess of Justice—and Maat. Crowley explicitly identifiesThmaist with Maat, for instance in his The Book of Thoth where he identifies the ‘double-wanded one’ of AL III:34as “Maat, Themis, the Lady of the Balance”: Aleister Crowley, The Book of Thoth, Samuel Weiser, York (ME),1974, p. 25)31 This is a point that has been brought up by J. Daniel Gunther in his Initiation in the Aeon of the Child, where hestates “These views are irreconcilable with historical evidence, and should therefore be reconsidered. If we aretruly to understand the progression of the Aeons, it must be done by studying empirical evidence, not by staticadherence to traditional interpretations. The Method of Science cannot be hamstrung by the Aim of Religion.”(Gunther, p. 166.) Gunther is a member of Crowley's AA and is considered an expert on Thelema. This sameattitude should be applied to all of the Crowley material, of course.32 Frater Achad, The Egyptian Revival, Samuel Weiser, NY, 197433 The relevant citation is from AL I:54-56: “Change not as much as the style of a letter; for behold! thou, oprophet, shalt not behold all these mysteries hidden therein. The child of thy bowels, he shall behold them. Expecthim not from the East, nor from the West; for from no expected house cometh that child. Aum!”34 The author, who has long personal experience of Eastern Orthodox liturgics and especially those of the Russianand Slavic churches, finds this explanation suspect as Crowley's Mass has much more in common with RomanCatholic versions of the same than with Orthodox forms. And, especially, no Orthodox clergyman or lay personwould refer to the Divine Liturgy as a “Mass” which is strictly a Roman Catholic term from the Latin missa. (TheOrthodox churches do not use Latin.) However, the apostolic succession of the Gnostic Catholic Church owesmore to renegade Orthodox lineages than to normative Catholic ones.35 As represented in the famous Thelemic greeting, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law” and itsresponse, “Love is the law, love under will,” both taken from the Book of the Law.36 There is some debate over whether the Jubilee year is the 49th year or the 50th year.37 Sanhedrin, 97A.38 Crowley, Confessions, p. 39839 H.

Infact, there were several. Durkheim's statement reflects his understanding that magic isnot amenable to rituals of group worship, since the approach to the sacred that isundertaken by the magician is a “delicate operation that requires precautions and amore or less complicated initiation ...”43 This did not stop the French magicians JulesDoinel (1842-1903) from creating (in 1890) and Papus (Gerard Encausse, 1865-1916)from joining (in 1892) a “Gnostic Catholic Church”; nor did it stop Crowley fromusing a version of the Gnostic Catholic Church as his vehicle for Thelema, writing aGnostic Mass in 1913 (a year after Durkheim's work was published). Whether or notsuch a church is an effective tool for magic and the goals of magic remains to be seen,however. Anyone witnessing some of the celebrations of the Mass by members of theGnostic Catholic Church at various times over the previous five decades or so wouldhave recognized obvious differences in style from those of normative Christiandenominations. It may be argued that magicians are not priests by nature—they areindividual, solitary persons devoted more to their own spiritual development than tothe spirituality of a group. Further, a magician's approach to a public, communal ritualmay leave something to be desired, particularly when the magician takes as his or hertemplate an established ritual like the Catholic Mass with nearly two thousand years ofhistory behind it and its celebration and then proceeds to alter it considerably to suitwhat can only be described as an opposing theological weltanschauung. At best, youhave an imitation of the original, a kind of “cover” version that may leave oneyearning nostalgically for the original. At worst, the results can range from thescandalous to the hilarious ... to the just plain sad. Given the options, one easily prefersthe scandalous.The scandalous might have been Crowley's intent in the early days of the twentiethcentury but now, in the early days of the twenty-first century, what Crowley saw aschallenging and provocative hardly constitutes cause for censorship or suppression(except perhaps by the religious Right, but they are easily inflamed). Crowley wanted"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"to institutionalize (and make popularly accessible) the religious and philosophicalprecepts underpinning his new faith of Thelema. He saw the Mass—and the GnosticCatholic Church—as the vehicle for doing this, much in the way the Catholic Mass canbe seen as the vehicle for proclaiming and celebrating the doctrines and theology ofRoman Catholicism. But Crowley was a magician, first and foremost. His teachings arecouched in magical language and magical references. Virtually all of his writings weredesigned for those belonging to one or both of his most important magical societies,the AA, and the OTO, neither of which were designed with communities ofworshippers in mind but which are predicated on the idea of individual (not group)attainment.His theology is easily summed up in the familiar “Do what thou wilt shall be thewhole of the Law” and “Love is the law, love under will.” It was antinomian,authoritarian, and transgressive. After one exhorts everyone to do their will, that everyman and every woman is a star, there is not much else to the theology or the doctrine.The core of Thelema is in the work itself, the Great Work of uniting oneself with one'sHoly Guardian Angel (to use the Golden Dawn and AA terminology), and that isan individual and not a group endeavor.44The famous Biblical Ten Commandments—handed down to Moses from God—consists of three commandments concerning sins against God and sevencommandments prohibiting sin against the community. There is no identification ofsins against one's self. It is as if God and community were all that mattered spiritually;that if one abides by the rules of God and family then one has already avoided sinagainst one's self. What Thelema does is question that assumption: in other words, is itpossible to sin against one's self? The Thelemic answer is a definite “yes.” If one obeysthe commandments concerning God and community to the detriment of one's self thenone is sinning against one's self. What Crowley does is turn the assumptions implicit inthe Abrahamic religions on their head by insisting that the individual matters morethan the community or, to be more precise, that the salvation or preservation of thecommunity is dependent upon the spiritual growth of its component individuals. This,of course, is the magical worldview and always has been, ever since the bifurcationbetween the needs of the individual and the state took place sometime in mistyantiquity.45 What Crowley had attempted to do was to codify the magical worldview asa religious worldview, applicable to all.Thus the tension between the magical worldview and the requirements of anorganized church contributes to confusion concerning the liturgics. Crowley's religionhas sexual mysteries at its heart, and Crowley—as a magician—was devoted to itsprosyletizing. He understood the sacrament of the Mass—and most especially the riteof transubstantiation—as a Gnostic rite of transformation, and it can be argued thatthis is so, or certainly can be interpreted that way. The problem remains, however, howto teach this concept to the general public if it has no background in religious studies,"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Gnosticism, or Tantrism, much less Kabbalah or ceremonial magic?A further difficulty is raised by the unitary form of the Catholic Mass and its singlepriest-celebrant. This dynamic was transformed by the Crowley church into a dualpriesthood of a man and a woman, a priest and a priestess. On a very basic liturgicallevel this presents problems in conceptualization, but most importantly, in theidentification of two individuals with the appropriate transformative Power whichmust take place simultaneously and in harmony. There are other, more easilyorganized, rituals that involve male and female participants which could have beenused instead (or simply invented), but it was Crowley's intention to use the CatholicMass as the basic structure, possibly with a view towards forcing the public tounderstand the sexual component of a rite with which they were already familiar—albeit in a different context—and thus providing a kind of legitimacy of lineage, muchin the same way pagan shrines in Europe were converted into Catholic holy places bythe building of churches on the same spots.All of this, however, is predicated upon Crowley's religion and its understanding ofthe nature of the Gods.Central to most descriptions of religions is this concept of a God or Gods. While theword “religion” is relatively new, and is in fact problematic in some cultures which donot recognize this artificial distinction between spirituality and other areas of culture,we can assume for the sake of this essay that religions (popularly understood) relyupon the existence of some kind of supernatural Power, Creator or Cosmic Judge wecall a God.One of the most bewildering aspects of Thelema to outsiders is the near-chaoticassembly of gods, goddesses and techniques from religious traditions spanning theglobe and the centuries. We have seen some of this in the previous chapter. While theBook of the Law is focused on Egyptian gods, by the time one is finished with even acursory look at Crowley's writings, one realizes that Egypt is not the only culturaltouchstone for the movement.46Crowley's own self-identification with the Beast of the Book of Revelation—and hissoror mystica as the Scarlet Woman or Whore of Babylon (Babalon, to use hisspelling)—seems at first glance to be out of synch with the rest of his philosophy.After all, the Beast 666 and the Whore of Babylon are characters specific to theChristian Bible. How does one rectify the Biblical personalities with ancient Egyptianor Sumerian archetypes?Crowley's early childhood was spent in the somewhat lethal embrace of a Christiansect called the Plymouth Brethren. In fact, he attended schools run by the Brethren formost of his childhood and adolescence, only escaping the denomination by the time heenrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1895. As a child, his mother would refer tohim as “the Beast” with its obvious Biblical connotations and it seems Crowley tookthe appelation to heart, particularly as he got older and began to question Christianity."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"He never abandoned the Beast nomenclature, however, for he seemed to feel that thiswas an aspect of his identity—not only as a human being, as his mother's son, but—asa magician and a prophet of the New Age. Thus, in order to overthrow the Old Age hecame to identify himself with its anti-god, the Beast of Revelation. This would predateany exposure Crowley had to the rich fabric of Egyptian spirituality.It was most likely his introduction to the Golden Dawn that gave Crowley hisbackground in Egyptian religion and in the names of their gods. As we have seen in theprevious chapter, he took those names to heart and they resurfaced in his Book of theLaw and in the Holy Books: names such as Hoor-paar-kraat, Ra-hoor-khuit and Thma-est (which spellings are not found in popular works on Egyptology) make their wayinto Crowley's religion, as well as the concept of the Equinox of the Gods and theassociated rotation of its divine officers throughout the year.But he also added a liberal dose of Greek and Roman concepts as well as someAsian ideas. While the Golden Dawn had a few Asian-inspired documents—such asinstructions concerning the tattwas (Indian elemental forms) and some basic yogaexercises—it was rather more focused on western esoterica than “Orientalia.” Thismay be due to the example of the Theosophical Society, which began as a repositoryofwestern occult and hermetic ideas but which rapidly switched its focus to India andto Buddhism and indigenous Indian religions (normally grouped under the rubric“Hinduism”). Blavatsky's growing obsession with India and Tibet changed thecharacteristics of the Theosophical Society to such an extent that there was really verylittle room for Hermetica or western esoterica in general. Kabbalah was ignored, aswas ceremonial magic. These were areas that were picked up and developed to agreater degree by the Golden Dawn and its Masonic creators, thus filling a void thathad been created by the Theosophical Society's abandonment of its western esotericroots.Crowley, therefore, represented a bridge between both societies. While hisinitiations and instruction in spirituality began with the Golden Dawn, and he neverreally left the embrace of its initiatic structure,47 he did absorb some of the Asiantechniques that were the focus of the Theosophical Society. He advocated practicessuch aspranayama (breath control), asana (yoga postures), and the attainment ofsamadhi (a higher state of consciousness reached through intensive meditation,analogous to a non-dualist state of awareness in which subject and object are one).48He recognized samadhi as an essential element of his own personal development andencouraged the pursuit of this enlightened state of consciousness among hisfollowers.49But this did not mean that he was a Buddhist or a “Hindu” by any stretch of theimagination.50 In fact, he broke with his good friend Alan Bennett (the Bhikku AnandaMetteya) over this issue. He was more than willing to take what he could from the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"supermarket of religious ideas, but he was not loyal to any one brand. In this, perhaps,he was typical of the stereotypical New Ager, who is a spiritual dilettante and whopicks over ancient religious traditions like a shopper in a fruit and vegetable stand ...but with one important and crucial difference: unlike many of today's New Agespiritual seekers, Crowley did not skim the surfaces of the traditions he investigatedbut dived in completely. He had to know and to experience what these traditionsoffered, and he subjected himself to strenuous physical and intellectual pursuit of thisknowledge. The fact that he was at leisure for much of his early life, due to aninheritance from his father's estate, contributed to his ability to wander the world anddevote himself to spiritual pursuits. He would incorporate significant amounts of thesetraditions into his own occult orders and into his religion of Thelema, and while wemay argue about his selection process or question the assumptions upon which some ofthe intellectual material is based, there can be no doubt that there was a strong elementof sincerity in Crowley's approach.Crowley believed in his own system, in his role as a prophet, and in the Book of theLaw. There can be no other explanation for his life's work than this. Thus, in order tocomprehend the ramifications and implications of Thelema—particularly asrepresented in the Typhonian Tradition—we need to understand Crowley's concept ofthe Gods."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Apocalypse NowAs mentioned, Crowley's first exposure to religion was in a Christian fundamentalisthousehold, whose members belonged to the sect known as the Plymouth Brethren. Likemany Protestant denominations with an extreme view of scripture, this one placed anemphasis on the Book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse. This is acontroversial text, dealing with the End of Days and the Final Judgement. It is couchedin esoteric symbolism, more than any other Biblical text, and defies easyinterpretation, but it is within its pages that we come across such famous concepts asthe “number of the Beast” which is 666, as well as the Beast himself, and the Whore ofBabylon. It is a book that foretells the fall of Rome and/or Jerusalem, and a final,cosmic battle between the forces of Light and Darkness. There are dragons, trumpets,and angels galore and it is beyond the scope of this (or most any) book to give a fulland coherent description of its contents or to analyze its meaning.51 Rather, we shallfocus on the handful of elements that meant most to Crowley and which surfaced soprominently in his cultus.The Book of Revelation virtually overshadows the rest of the New Tesament due toits surreal, cinematic imagery and its prophecies of doom. Those who focus on this texttend to neglect the message of the Gospels in favor of the more drastic condemnationsof the Church's enemies.One of these enemies is the Beast. According to many theologians, this particularBeast symbolizes Rome and the persecution of Christians by the Roman emperor. Thenumber of the Beast is 666, but no further clarification of this number is given in thetext. Some believe it is a coded reference to the emperor Nero. In any event, thatnumber has come to be synonymous with evil incarnate and is frequently cited as areference to the Devil itself.It is important to note that there are two beasts mentioned in Revelations. The firstcomes out of the sea—the abyss—and the second from out of the earth. They are eachempowered by the Dragon, to whom they evidently owe their allegiance. Thus, there issome confusion in Thelemic circles as to just what Beast Crowley was referring to, andwhy. Of course, he favored the 666 designation, making him the Beast of the Earth,known to readers of the Bible as the “False Prophet.”Crowley would adopt the number as his own, and offer pages of Kabbalistic-styleanalysis of its meaning. He was able to show that the Greek term To Mega Therion or“the Great Beast” added up to 666 when using Greek numerology, or gematria.52Gematria is a system of numerology in which letters (of the Greek or Hebrew alphabet)equal numbers. When a word has the same numerical value as another word, then arelationship between them both is assumed to the extent that one word may clarify orjustify the other. (This fascination with gematria has bedeviled Thelema for much ofits existence to date; it became a focus of Frater Achad's symbol system and, later, of"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Kenneth Grant's analysis of Thelema which would take gematria to near ridiculouslengths. The idea that the Bible contains coded information is central to Kabbalisticexegesis as well as more recent textual analysis such as The Bible Code and its heirs. Itis by no means unique to Thelema.)The fact that there are two Beasts in Revelation, plus one Dragon, begs the question:could there be, or have there been, other contenders in Thelema for these availabledesignations? Was there a human Beast of the Abyss? More importantly, perhaps, wasthere a physical/biological Dragon in a Thelemic context? The answers to both of thesequestions has to be a somewhat qualified “no.” Crowley was not taking the entire textof Revelation as a blueprint for his own religion, but only that section of it that hebelieved seemed to refer to himself. But one has to wonder if Crowley ever consideredthat there might be another human manifestation from Revelation. This will lead us tothe example of Jack Parsons, who famously identified himself with the Anti-Christ,and we will look at that in another chapter.Why Crowley would identify himself with the Devil is an important point and onewhich will lead us directly to the concept of the Dark Lord. For Crowley, the Devil issomething more ancient and more respectable than the caricature we come across innormative Christian imagery. The Devil represents everything the Church wants tosuppress, and this includes most especially expressions of human sexuality.Crowley's view of Satanism and Devil-worship would have been colored by theContinental obsession with the Black Mass. This ritual famously blasphemes theCatholic Mass, but in order to do so makes use of sexual elements. Thus, a woman isused in place of the altar; coitus is performed on the woman in place of thetransubstantiation of the bread and wine.53 These are all the scandalous aspects of theBlack Mass as it was popularly understood through such vehicles as J. K. Huysmann'sbest-selling novel, Là-Bas or “Down There.” In this context, sexuality is transgressive.It is used to attack the Church at its most delicate and important point: the sacrifice ofthe Mass itself, the central ritual of the faith that is normally celebrated by celibatepriests. Crowley would take up this theme in his own Catholic-inspired Gnostic Massin which the sexual elements are once again represented, albeit in a more sedate waythan in the rapacious rituals of the nineteenth-century French esthetes.54To Crowley, the restrictive attitudes of the Church were themselves sinful. As it iswritten in the Book of the Law: “The word of Sin is Restriction” (AL I:41). This is asubtle play on words, for the exact meaning of the term “religion” is derived from theLatin religio, itself probably derived from the verb ligare which means “to bind” (as inthe modern English ligature). The meaning of the sentence to a Thelemite is clear: it isreligion that is sinful, religion that “binds.” Such restriction is anathema to a doctrinewhose central affirmation of faith is “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of theLaw.” Thus Crowley, by identifying with the great enemy of the Church—the Beast666—is aligning himself with the enemy of restriction, and therefore with the free"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"expression of all forms of human sexuality: the ultimate example of sin and animportant target of the Abrahamic religions. This is emphasized by the rest of theverse quoted above:The word of Sin is Restriction. O man! refuse not thy wife, if she will! O lover,if thou wilt, depart! There is no bond55 that can unite the divided but love: allelse is a curse. Accurséd! Accurséd be it to the aeons! Hell. (AL I:41)This emphasis on love rather than law as the touchstone for human relationships isone element of Thelema that sets it apart from mainstream religion. When love goes,according to the verse, then so should the lover. This dissociates the act of love fromlegal considerations, whether of religion or of secular government. It is mostespecially—given the context—an attack on the sacrament of matrimony and onreligiously-sanctioned marriage. If marriage is subtracted from the equation, what isleft? Either pure eros—sexuality as a form of human relationship—or something evendeeper: a relationship based not only on sexuality popularly understood, but onemotional attraction and attachment the way many adolescents experience it—withouta legal or a religious context, something approaching Jungian ideas of archetypes orFreudian ideas of repressed erotic feelings for one's parent. As Crowley himself isknown to have had both male and female lovers, married and unmarried, this seemsconsistent with his worldview. But it is inconsistent with the mainstream religions ofhis time, and he would be moved to see in the Beast a force of resistance against thestrictures of the establishment, of the status quo, because he perceived them asobstacles to a fuller knowledge of the Self. It is this tension between the Self andCommunity (particularly in the sphere of sexuality and human relationships) that is thefocal point of Thelema, at least as understood by some of its most prominentapologists such as Kenneth Grant. It is also the point at which Lovecraft balks,pointing to the transgressive magician and sorcerer as the cause of the community'svulnerability to forces from Outside.By identifying himself—in a positive way—with the Beast, Crowley wasperforming a kind of self-therapy. He was taking the suppressed and repressedelements of a personality that had been molded by a normative and restrictiveChristian sect and liberating them by means of re-characterizing them as positivevalues and not negative impulses.56 It was perhaps more important for Crowley to self-identify this way than it was for his followers, for whom the Beast of the Book ofRevelation might have less powerful (even confusing) associations. It marked hisindependence from Christian—and hence English—society and its expectations ofconformity. It was dramatic, certainly, especially for the time. But was there moresubstance to the image than that?To answer that question we must visit another powerful image of the Book ofRevelation, the Whore of Babylon."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"This personality is as complex and mysterious as the Beast. It is obviously a codedreference that made a lot of sense at the time, and in the millenia since the Book ofRevelation was written there have been numerous attempts to analyze and identify theWhore in contemporary contexts. Where Crowley was concerned, the Whore ofBabylon could only be a reference to his Consort, of whom he had quite a series that hecalled “Scarlet Women.”In the Book of Revelation the Whore of Babylon is referred to as “Babylon theGreat, Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth” (Revelations 17:3-6).Babylon was a reference to the alien culture that had crushed the Israelites anddestroyed Solomon's Temple, and which thus became a code word for the RomanEmpire that was the object of scorn of the writer of Revelations. Like Rome, Babylonwas viewed as an “evil empire” bent on destroying God's people. At the time the Bookof Revelation was being written—about the first century CE—the land of Israel wasunder Roman domination. Both Christians (at the time little more than a Jewish sect)and Jews were being persecuted as a result of their refusal to obey the edicts ofEmperor Domitian, who demanded that everyone in his empire worship him as a god ...or be executed.The Whore of Babylon is depicted as wearing purple and scarlet robes, and holding agolden cup filled with “the abominations and filthiness of her fornication.” She sat ona scarlet beast with seven heads and ten horns, and was drunk on the blood of saintsand martyrs. (Purple was the color of Roman royalty and was forbidden to the averagecitizen, so its inclusion here is instructive.)Crowley incorporated this personality—one is hard-pressed to refer to her as a god,at least not in her Biblical persona—into his religion as the personification of thefemale principle of the universe, as Shakti: the female partner to the Beast, whorepresents the male principle, or Shiva. The cup of “abominations” is an analogue ofthe commingled male and female essences that are known as amrita in the East. And,just as in Revelation the Beast was subordinate to the Dragon, in Crowley's theologicalstructure the Beast is subordinate to other powers.In order to clarify these admittedly bizarre relationships it is worthwhile to haverecourse to the Thelemic Creed as offered in the liturgy of the Gnostic Mass, writtenby Crowley:I believe in one secret and ineffable LORD; and in one Star in the company ofStars of whose fire we are created, and to which we shall return; and in oneFather of Life, Mystery of Mystery, in His name CHAOS, the sole viceregent ofthe Sun upon Earth; and in one Air the nourisher of all that breathes.And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all, and in one Womb wherein allmen are begotten, and wherein they shall rest, Mystery of Mystery, in Her nameBABALON."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in His nameBAPHOMET.And I believe in one Gnostic and Catholic Church of Light, Life, Love andLiberty, the Word of whose Law is THELEMA.And I believe in the communion of Saints.And, forasmuch as meat and drink are transmuted in us daily into spiritualsubstance, I believe in the Miracle of the Mass.And I confess one Baptism of Wisdom whereby we accomplish the Miracle ofIncarnation.And I confess my life one, individual, and eternal that was, and is, and is tocome.AUMGN, AUMGN, AUMGN.Readers who were brought up Roman Catholic—like the present author—may beforgiven if they recognize what seems to be a travesty of the Apostles' Creed of theiryouth.

That this is different from"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"the “ineffable LORD” in the Thelemic Creed seems clear from the text. Here, theFather is the “Father of Life,” and is the vice-regent of the Sun on earth. And,somewhat disconcertingly perhaps, his name is CHAOS. Chaos was, indeed, one of theappelations of the Egyptian god Set and he is referred to as such in the Greek magicalpapyri.57 A god with the name Chaos would not be a reference to Osiris, or Horus, orThoth, or Ra or any of the other more popular deities. Chaos is associated, in Egypt andin the Near and Middle East of the period (first century CE at the latest), with Set andwith Set-Typhon. And the Star to which the Creed refers could only be—for Grant andthe Typhonians—the Pole Star with its seven circumpolar attendants the Big Dipper(or, as it was known in Egypt, the “Thigh of Set”). The very important statementconcerning “one Star in the company of Stars of whose fire we are created, and towhich we shall return,” implies the extra-terrestrial origins of humanity and byextension its ultimate destination. This “Star” has been identified as the Sun, of whomthe Father is the sole vice-regent, but I believe this is a blind (as were the seven“planets” in Mithraism58) for the “real” Sun, which is the immortal Pole Star, a sunthat never rises or sets but which sits unmoving directly overhead.The name CHAOS has been interpreted to mean Air and Gas. The first statement ofthe Thelemic Creed ends with “Air, the nourisher of all that breathes” and is thusconnected with CHAOS, the Star, and the Father.The very next doctrinal statement in the Creed identifies BABALON as “the Motherof us all” and as the Earth itself. We therefore have the Sky and the Earth—Air andEarth—CHAOS and BABALON as the first divinities enumerated in the Creed. This isfollowed by BAPHOMET, which was Crowley's name in the OTO.Thus, we have two Ur-gods—CHAOS and BABALON—followed by the name of theProphet of the New Aeon, BAPHOMET or Crowley himself. This requires us to lookmore closely at BABALON since Crowley was fixated on her and on what sherepresented, clarifying that his succession of (female) magical partners—the ScarletWomen—were but avatars of Babalon.The three Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam—do not elevatethe female principle to the level of divinity. For that reason they are often referred toas “patriarchal” religions. From the previous chapter, we remember that Crowley—likesome of the anthropologists of his day—believed that the patriarchal era was precededby a matriarchal one. While this theory has largely been disproved on the basis ofarchaeological and other evidence, it nonetheless remains a strong concept amongthose professing a New Age worldview. One is tempted to imagine what the worldwould look like if matriarchal—as opposed to patriarchal—religions were thedominant force in the west.In the east, however, women—and female representations of godhead—are morecommon. In India, goddesses are of supreme importance especially among specificsects that worship Kali, Durga, Shakti, etc. In China, among the Daoists and the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Buddhists, Quan Yin is an extremely important goddess and believed to be the Chineseversion of the Indian Avalokitesvara, the (male) God of Compassion. Even inpredominantly Muslim Indonesia, the goddesses Sri, Lara Kidul, and Durga are stillimportant and still reverenced.59Thelemic documents, including the Book of the Law and the Gnostic Mass, revealthe desire to reinstate awareness of the feminine aspect of divinity. Conscious that thisis an antinomian position to take, the feminine aspect that is most identified andcherished is that of the Whore of Babylon, perhaps the most transgressive femaleimage in all of Christendom.As Gail Corrington Streete has discussed at some length60 the Whore of Babylon(porne megale) is but one iteration of the “foreign woman” of the Bible, the seducer ofIsrael who tries to tempt men away from the True Faith. But the “foreign woman” isalso the Queen of Sheba, who tempted Solomon himself with the worship of foreigngods; she is Jezebel; and so many other strong yet strange women in the Bible whorepresent not only “woman” in general but ideas related to foreign-ness, to the alien,and the Other. Like Set, Babalon is a foreign deity. Set may represent ideas ofmasculine or male chaos where Babalon represents the feminine or female aspect ofchaos. They are the Yang and Yin, respectively, of every antinomian and unorthodoxbelief and practice.But there is another possible motive for this idealization of the Whore of Babylonand it may rest in the sexual mysteries themselves, the ones that Crowley learned fromthe OTO of Karl Kellner and Theodor Reuss, which placed an emphasis on themingling of both male and female sexual excretions. This “sex magic” at the heart ofthe OTO mysteries is what has been elaborated upon at great length by Kenneth Grantand it forms the initiatic process of the Typhonian Current. In this context, a “whore”is a sexually-promiscuous woman, a woman who has sex for money or other favors,and as such is a threat to other women because of the implied devaluation of sexualintimacy between husband and wife: the characterization of sexuality as a biologicalfunction that can be bought and sold like food or water or manual labor rather than asthe seal of an emotional and spiritual contract. The whore exists outside of thecommunity of married men and women, of householders, and of upholders of thegovernment, the church, and even of consensus reality. The relationship with aprostitute is a secret relationship; few men boast of going to prostitutes or of havingany sort of relationship with them outside of the sex act. In fact, the more established aman is—the more respected in his community, his government, his religion, hisbusiness—the less likely he is to admit to such a relationship in the public forum. Hemay go to great lengths to conceal it, to keep it secret, hidden, and entirely personal. Itis, in a sense, an “esoteric” or “occult” relationship.In the Book of Revelation, the Whore of Babylon represents not only the ultimateProstitute and sexually active Woman, but also signifies an enemy of the Church. It is"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"in this dual role that she is important to Thelema; for even as sexual mores havechanged considerably since the Victorian era when Crowley was a youth, Church andthe State are still viable targets for a religion of liberation and freedom.There is one more aspect to the Whore of Babylon that must be considered, and thatis her stated origin: Babylon. The implication is clear: a connection, however tenuous,not to Egypt but to Sumer, Akkad and Babylon itself. The Whore of Babalon (to useCrowley's spelling based on his rendering of the name to satisfy a gematria of his own)is thereby a link to the most ancient of the known western religions, the one that is thefocus of Grant's work and one that is referenced by Crowley, Parsons, and otherThelemic authors and personalities, and enshrined in the Schlangekraft recension ofthe Necronomicon: the Sumerian tradition.While Crowley's fixation on the Beast and the Whore of the Christian Bible mayhave been motivated originally by a desire to be a “bad boy” and outrage the adultsaround him, the adolescent fantasy of transgression became enshrined in a doctrine.The Whore was lifted out of its Biblical context and re-imagined as “the Mother of usall” and as a Mesopotamian deity (as was Aiwass). It should be acknowledged,however, that this theme of transgression applies not only to the Christianity of theBook of Revelation, but—because of the destruction of Solomon's Temple by theBabylonians—to Judaism as well. Crowley's alleged anti-Semitism has been thesubject of several investigations and we won't belabor the point here. It may besufficient to state that Crowley's philosophy was deliberately provocative and anti-establishment in nature to the extent that he ridiculed most human institutions andtherefore treated most people with contempt if they were not converts to his new faith.This might not have been the result of deep feelings of genuine racism, sexism, etc. butwas rather what one would expect of someone who set himself up as the Prophet of anew Age, much in the same way that Moses and his followers rained death on theirenemies, or the Church in its many inquisitorial purges and crusades, or the anti-Semitic remarks that can be found in the Qur'an and the military actions that tookplace against non-Muslims during the Prophet's life and those of subsequentcaliphates. This is not to say one should enshrine these ill-advised declarations asstatements of doctrinal authority, however. They need interpreting; yet a key point ofcontention in this case is that no one is supposed to interpret Crowley's writings butCrowley himself.61This is one of the inherent contradictions in Thelema, for while Crowley insistedthat he be the arbiter of all things Thelemic, his slogan was quite different: “Ourmethod is science, our aim is religion.” The “our” is understood not as the editorial orPapal first person plural, but as encompassing all Thelemites. If the scientific methodis indeed the cornerstone of Crowley's occult praxis, then it behooves Thelemites toundertake independent experimentation and discovery.This is precisely what the late Kenneth Grant set out to do, and in the process he"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"made some interesting and possibly crucial discoveries. Among these was the value ofdifferent sets of god-forms from different cultures, in particular those with whichCrowley himself was not as familiar. While his incorporation of genuine Tantric andAfro-Caribbean data makes his writings worthwhile for anyone interested in what anexpansion of Crowley's basic themes would look like—and in particular Crowley'smagic—it is Grant's willingness to look beyond religion and spiritual techniques toother sources of information that place this British occultist upon an entirely differentplateau. If Crowley was committed to having his philosophy embraced by the masses—and used every means at his disposal to ensure this, including public performancesof his rites, publishing occult novels, and attempting to influence famous celebrities—then Grant's discovery of Thelemic themes in the fictional writing of Howard PhillipsLovecraft should have been welcomed by Crowley's followers enthusiastically,especially as Lovecraft's imagined cultus reflects so deeply Crowley's own revealedreligion."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Beast in the CaveIn 1907, Crowley was writing some of the works that became seminal to the doctrinesof Thelema, known as The Holy Books. These include Liber Liberi vel Lapidus Lazuli,Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente, and other works written between October 30 andNovember 1 of that year, and Liber Arcanorum and Liber Carcerorum, written betweenDecember 5th and 14th that same year. Lovecraft would have had no knowledge ofthis, as he was only a seventeen-year old recluse living at home on Angell Street inProvidence, Rhode Island, dreaming of the stars. Instead, he later would write of anorgiastic ritual taking place that year in the bayous outside New Orleans, Louisiana,and on the very same day that Crowley was writing the books enumerated above.The story Lovecraft wrote is entitled “The Call of Cthulhu” and is arguably his mostfamous work. He wrote the story in 1926, in late August or early September, but placedthe action in New Orleans in 1907 and later in Providence in 1925. How is thisrelevant?Lovecraft's placement of the orgiastic ritual in honor of the high priest of the GreatOld Ones, Cthulhu, and the discovery of a statue of Cthulhu by the New Orleans policeon Halloween, 1907 coincides precisely with Crowley's fevered writing of his owngothic prose. In the Liber Liberi vel Lapidus Lazuli, for instance, Crowley writes theword “Tutulu” for the first time. He claims not to know what this word means, orwhere it came from. As the name of Lovecraft's fictional alien god can be pronounced“Kutulu,” it seems more than coincidental, as Kenneth Grant himself noted.However, this is only the tip of an eldritch iceberg.In Crowley's Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente—or “The Book of the Heart Girt with aSerpent”—there are numerous references to the “Abyss of the Great Deep,” to Typhon,Python, and the appearance of an “old gnarled fish” with tentacles ... all descriptionsthat match Lovecraft's imagined Cthulhu perfectly. Not approximately, but perfectly.Crowley's volume was written on November 1, 1907. The ritual for Cthulhu in NewOrleans took place on the same day, month and year.Here are the relevant passages:From Liber Liberi vel Lapidus Lazuli:1. By the burning of the incense was the Word revealed, and by the distant drug.2. O meal and honey and oil! O beautiful flag of the moon, that she hangs out in thecentre of bliss!3. These loosen the swathings of the corpse; these unbind the feet of Osiris, so thatthe flaming God may rage through the firmament with his fantastic spear.4.

We know why all is hidden in the stone, within the coffin, within the mightysepulchre, and we too answer Olalám! Imál! Tutúlu! as it is written in the ancientbook.7. Three words of that book are as life to a new æon; no god has read the whole.8. But thou and I, O God, have written it page by page.62And in Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente:Then was the Adept glad, and lifted his arm. Lo! an earthquake, and plague, andterror on the earth!63And:Behold! the Abyss of the Great Deep. Therein is a mighty dolphin, lashing hissides with the force of the waves.64And:Thou art Sebek the crocodile against Asar; thou art Mati, the Slayer in the Deep.Thou art Typhon, the Wrath of the Elements, O Thou who transcendest theForces in their Concourse and Cohesion, in their Death and their Disruption.Thou art Python, the terrible serpent about the end of all things!65And finally:I trembled at Thy coming, O my God, for Thy messenger was more terrible thanthe Death-star. On the threshold stood the fulminant figure of Evil, the Horror ofemptiness, with his ghastly eyes like poisonous wells. He stood, and thechamber was corrupt; the air stank. He was an old and gnarled fish more hideousthan the shells of Abaddon. He enveloped me with his demon tentacles; yea, theeight fears took hold upon me.66Compare with relevant passages from Lovecraft's “Call of Cthulhu”:Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evident pictorial intent,though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature. Itseemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a formwhich only a diseased fancy could conceive. If I say that my somewhatextravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon,and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. Apulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentarywings; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it mostshockingly frightful. Behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a Cyclopeanarchitectural background.67"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"And:The figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close andcareful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitelyartistic workmanship. It represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline,but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly,rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrowwings behind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnaturalmalignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on arectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tipsof the wings touched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the centre,whilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs gripped thefront edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward the bottom of thepedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so that the ends of the facialfeelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the croucher'selevated knees. The aspect of the whole was abnormally life-like, and the moresubtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, andincalculable age was umistakable; yet not one link did it shew with any knowntype of art belonging to civilisation's youth—or indeed to any other time.Totally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the soapy,greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striationsresembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy. The characters along thebase were equally baffling; and no member present, despite a representation ofhalf the world's expert learning in this field, could form the least notion of eventheir remotest linguistic kinship.In Liber Liberi vel Lapidus Lazuli, Crowley refers to several of the images withwhich Lovecraft would be consumed in his stories, but especially in “The Call ofCthulhu.” Here we have a buried god that is awakened from a stone, in a coffin, in asepulchre, and mysterious words written in an ancient book, including Tutulu. And “ofpure black marble is the sorry statue” resonates with the black stone on which thestatue of Cthulhu squats.In Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente we have an expansion of this theme, beginning withan earthquake (Lovecraft's story is centered around an actual earthquake that tookplace in 1925), and extending to an Abyss of the Great Deep, the Slayer in the Deep, aDeath-star, and the “fulminant figure of Evil” (a stinking, fish-like creature withtentacles). This figure is a messenger of the Gods and, indeed, Cthulhu is not only agod itself but a high priest of the Great Old Ones who will return to earth when “thestars are right.” A more paranoid observer than your author may wonder if thestatement in Liber AL—“Every man and every woman is a star”—is a decoding of thefamous Lovecraft quotation “when the stars are right.” It would imply that when the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"followers of Thelema (the “stars”) are powerful enough, or numerous enough, then theGreat Old Ones will return.This was certainly Crowley's objective, as understood by Grant and as revealed bythese excerpts from Crowley's Holy Books of Thelema. Crowley believed that the firsttwo books mentioned above were not his writing, but were inspired works dictated tohim by his Holy Guardian Angel, the ancient Sumerian personality Aiwass, afterCrowley had attained samadhi during a course of rituals he undertook with hiscolleague, George Cecil Jones, in England.68 Even the undecipherable language of“Olalam Imal Tutulu” has its counterpart in the enigmatic hieroglyphics of the Cthulhustatue and the ecstatic, glossolalia-like cries of the worshippers in the Louisianaswamps.69 Both men—the American author and the English magician—were dealingwith the same subject matter, and indeed Lovecraft had dated the first appearance ofthe Cthulhu statue to the same year, month and day that Crowley began writing thesesections of the Holy Books.There is no hard evidence that either man knew of the other, although the authorbelieves that references to an English satanist in Lovecraft's “The Thing on theDoorstep” could be an allusion to Crowley. In any event, to suggest that these two mencooperated or collaborated in any deliberate way would be the height (or depth!) ofconspiracy theory. It may actually be more logical to suggest—as an explanation forsome of these coincidences—that darker forces were at work. In fact, it is possible thatthe same forces of which Lovecraft himself writes—the telepathic communicationbetween followers of Cthulhu and the Great Old Ones—was what prompted him towrite these fictional accounts of real events. Either Lovecraft was in some kind oftelepathic communication with Crowley, or both men were in telepathiccommunication with ... Something Else.This Dark Lord of the Holy Books is one of the gods—perhaps the most importantgod—of the Crowley pantheon. In the Crowley line of succession, this god is at thejuncture of Egyptian and Sumerian religion and is thus pre-Judaic. In Lovecraft'ssuccession, Cthulhu is a high priest of the Great Old Ones who came to the planet fromthe stars aeons ago, long before humans walked the earth. Although dead and burieddeep beneath the earth or under the ocean, he can rise again once the “stars are right”and his followers assist in calling him up, in resurrecting him.This leads us to a slight detour into the Tibetan language.The word ku su lu in Tibetan70 evokes for us another coincidence, for it refers to ashaman (i.e., a kind of priest) but also to one who was once dead but who has comeback from death.71 This meme—the shaman who has come back from the dead—is aperfect description of Lovecraft's Cthulhu and may provide a means of understandingCrowley's Tutulu as well. According to Kenneth Grant, one possible translation of theword Tutulu can be “Who will attain.” These are all consistent with the idea presented"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"by Lovecraft of a high priest of the Great Old Ones, dead but “dreaming,” who willresurrect from his watery grave to take charge of the earth once more. As noted in theSchlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon, Cthulhu can be rendered in theSumerian language as kutu lu or “the man from Kutu” or “the man from theUnderworld.” Kutu—the Biblical Gudua, sometimes rendered Kutu or Kuta—was theancient city of Cutha, sacred to Nergal and the entrance to the Underworld in Sumerianreligion. It was also the city in Mesopotamia with special relevance for Islam, for itwas the city where the Qureish were from. The Qureish are, of course, the tribe of theProphet Muhammad, the tribe in charge of the pagan shrine in Mecca known as theKa'aba or the Black Stone. This was the shrine containing 360 idols, probably of theMoon God Hubal, that the Prophet dismantled and replaced with a shrine sacred to hisnew religion of Islam.The death and rebirth theme that is central to Siberian shamanism was also a crucialelement of Sumerian and Babylonian religion. The famous narrative of the descent ofthe Sumerian goddess Inanna (Ishtar) into the Underworld, and her rescue andresurrection three days later, is one of the legends that helped form the SumerianGnosis. Indeed, she has sometimes been identified with the Whore of Babylon. Whenshe finally ascended the seven levels of the Underworld to reappear in the world, shewas accompanied by a host of demons who had previously been restrained in theUnderworld, and who took advantage of her defeat of death to flood out of theirsubterranean prison and populate the earth. This bears some resemblance to Lovecraft'sfictional Cthulhu who is dead but who will be reborn “when the stars are right” and atthat time bring his alien gods to the earth to rule it once more. In both cases—theLovecraft scenario and the Sumerian prototype—the dead require the assistance of theliving to effect the resurrection.This complex narrative is reprised in the Christian example of Jesus who, after hiscrucifixion, “descended into hell” and rose on the third day. His descent into hell wasfor the purpose of releasing from the Underworld all those noble souls who had diedbefore he appeared on the earth to redeem humanity from original sin. In the Christiancase, the souls that were released were those of the righteous dead; in the Sumeriancase, the souls that were released were demonic forces. In the Lovecraft scenario, thegates are opened to hideous alien beings from outer space. Either the Christian case ismere wishful thinking, or a deliberate gloss on the older traditions of the region, or is itsomething else?Much has been written in the past hundred years or longer on the subject of the“dead and resurrected god,” referencing a whole category of such deities ranging fromOsiris to Tammuz, Mithra, and others in the Middle East and North Africa. It is oftencharacterized as evidence of an agricultural society in which seeds are planted (i.e.,“buried”) in the ground and then “resurrected” in the form of new plants. However, thisprocess could just as easily be the basis for any of a number of sexually-oriented"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"fertility cults as well, and not necessarily the basis for a dead and resurrected god (orgoddess, as in the case of Inanna).Unless, of course, there is a relation or connection between the idea of death andresurrection on the one hand and sexual intercourse and reproduction on the other. Inthe Gnostic Mass as revised by Crowley, we have the template of a celebration ofChrist's Last Supper and the consumption of his flesh and blood by the faithful overwhich is applied the sexual components of Crowley's cultus. While the sexual aspect ofthe Gnostic Mass is the most obvious one and the aspect that gets all the attention, thedeath and resurrection foundation of the Mass is still present and is in disguise.Crowley might have said that his Mass was the “reveal” of the innate sexual messageof the original Mass, while the original Mass can be interpreted as the “reveal” of theprimary death and resurrection message hidden within the Crowley version. They canbe seen as mirror images of each other, if one views them both from an angle slightlyoff-center, from—as Lovecraft would say—a “space between the spaces.”As in the Catholic Mass, the gods are present in the Gnostic Mass. They areclassified differently, of course, with a totally different emphasis. The reason thismuch time has been taken for a look at the Mass, its Credo, and its transgressivecharacteristics is because it is the formula that most clearly represents the coherence ofthe Thelemic message. That is not to say that the Mass is perfectly coherent, of course(but, then, neither is the Catholic Mass). But it can be viewed as a kind of wayangkulit, a shadow play conducted behind a curtain in which the actors are flat, two-dimensional puppets standing in for three-dimensional gods but which—in the case ofthe Gnostic Mass—are replaced by three-dimensional human beings standing in forextra-dimensional entities: those described at some length by Kenneth Grant, H.P.Lovecraft, and the Typhonian Tradition of magic.Like, for instance, Set."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Set-TyphonCrowley's Liber XXXVI72 contains a formula for establishing contact with theOld Ones through the invocation of Set, son of Isis and brother of Horus.—Kenneth Grant, Beyond the Mauve Zone, p. 123As must be obvious by now, Grant's focus throughout his aptly-named TyphonianTrilogy as well as in the construction and organization of his Typhonian Order alwayshas been the composite figure of Set-Typhon. Set is the ancient Egyptian god that haslong been associated with chaos, with the desert, with storms, with foreigners andforeign lands (i.e., the “Other”), and with the murder of Osiris and the ongoing strugglewith Horus, the son of Osiris. Typhon, on the other hand, is a Greek god who has manyof the same attributes of a god of darkness, storms and chaos. Typhon, like Set, wasborn unnaturally from his mother and, also like Set, was the enemy of the pantheon.Thus, it was the Greeks who identified Set as a version of their own Typhon and theform Set-Typhon came to be known in the Mediterranean. There has been muchspeculation in academic circles that the legends surrounding Typhon are derived fromthose of ancient Sumer, specifically the creation epic known as Enuma Elish and theepisode of the serpent monster, Tiamat, who is slain by Marduk in battle.73 As we haveseen, Grant identified Set-Typhon as a form of Crowley's supramundane contact,Aiwass, as well as of the Shaitan of the Yezidis, and linked it all to Sumer.Oddly, however, Crowley himself did not seem to focus on Set-Typhon to the extentthat his disciple would, except as a kind of twin to Horus as we have seen.74 Crowley'sattention was taken by Horus in his various forms as Hoor-par-kraat and the compositeRa-hoor-kuit, among others. Crowley identified with what he saw as the “solar phallic”nature of Osiris and Horus and, indeed, neither Set-Typhon nor Set himself were majorfigures in the Egyptian pantheon of the Golden Dawn—where Set appears as thepersonification of evil in the rituals associated with the idea of the Threshold andrepresents the “Averse Sephiroth” and the Qlippoth.75 In this instance, Set would notbe identified as a being to whom worship would be directed. One gets the sense that ifa member of the Golden Dawn were to construct rituals intended to invoke or evokeSet that it would be considered an act of “black magic,” i.e., a harmful or whollynegative act.To Grant, however, the character of Set is a rich vein of cosmic importance andGrant expands on this theme considerably, to the point that Set—in Grant's scheme ofthings—overtakes Horus and Osiris in relevance to the ideas embodied by Crowley'sdoctrine of Thelema. Where Osiris and Horus represent the solar aspect of Egyptianreligion, Set and Set-Typhon represent the stellar aspect. Osiris and Horus can beidentified with the rising and setting sun—and thus with the east and west respectively—but Set is identified with the circumpolar stars (in particular with the Great Bear or"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Ursa Major) and the north, the direction of the sun's nadir beneath the earth and therealm of Amenta: the Abode of the Dead. The author has elsewhere shown that theasterism known to us as the Big Dipper was identified with Set in the Egyptian textpopularly known as the Book of the Dead, specifically with the “thigh” of Set in thecrucial Opening of the Mouth ceremony.76 The Big Dipper is also a critical asterism inthe Necronomicon Gnosis, as the Gates between this world and the transdimensionalrealm are opened “when the Great Bear hangs from its tail in the sky.”77 Grantdiscovered the close association between the Egyptian Set and the Necronomicon,which further reinforced his theory concerning the Tunnels of Set. These tunnels arehidden pathways on the “nightside” of the Kabbalistic “Tree of Life”—known toKabbalists as the Sitra Ahra, or “Other Side”—that he associates with the Qlippoth, the“shells” of a previous creation that was destroyed due to imbalance resulting inshattered or broken sephiroth, specifically the sephira Gevurah or “Severity.” Theseshards of an Elder Creation roam the cosmos as evil spirits or demonic forces, but toGrant these are value judgements made by pious monotheists who ignore their truenature.But there is more to Set than even all of this. A close examination of Set'simportance and character in the ancient Egyptian texts reveal that there is a closecorrelation between how the Egyptians understood Set and the initiatory process ofCrowley's OTO as well as the central thesis of Grant's ouevre.In recent years there has been much academic investigation and discourse on the natureand identity of Set. This discourse has ranged from the fields of pure Egyptology tostudies of Gnosticism and the Kabbalah. Set remains an engimatic figure, a stranger tothe rest of Egyptian religion in so many ways. Indeed, the identity of Set's “animal”(the totemic creature or zoötype with which Set is identified in hieroglyphics andEgyptian art) remains unidentified, and even the etymology of Set's name is a sourceof controversy. While there is no space to go into all of this here, relevant topics willbe highlighted so that the reader can appreciate the extent of the Crowley-Grant-Lovecraft concept, characterized by Grant as the Necronomicon Gnosis."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Who is Set?There are two basic schools of thought concerning the origins of Set. One schoolclaims that Set represents an ancient ruler of Upper (i.e., southern) Egypt who cameinto conflict with a ruler represented by Horus of Lower (i.e., northern) Egypt. It is thispolitical and military conflict that led to the myth of the warfare between Set andHorus.This idea has been criticized as there is no historical evidence to support it, althoughit is true that pharaohs considered themselves rulers of both Upper and Lower Egypt,and that their double crowns were references to the union of Set and Horus.Another school has it that Set represents a foreign god, and hence a foreign tribe,race, country. This foreign deity eventually became incorporated into the overallreligion, representing all those concepts that were considered antinomian,transgressive, and “other.” There is some support for this interpretation but it is by nomeans conclusive.The name “Set” defies translation, just as his totemic animal defies identification.The hieroglyphic representing the word for Set can be pronounced in various ways,depending on the area of Egypt (Upper or Lower) and the relevant dynasty.78Variations such as “Setah,” “Sut,” “Seth,” and of course “Set” have been put forwardas alternatives.79 The determinative form has been used in words denoting storm,thunder, roaring, chaos, illness, nightmares, darkness, and a host of other dangerousphenomena. One theory is that Set represents that which separates or divides. Set is thegod of alien lands (alien to Egypt and thus, by extension, the “Other”) and the desert,and as such is a liminal figure, a god of the Threshold, the guardian at the Gate to theUnderworld as the Golden Dawn rituals testify.This may be due to (at least in part) the identification of the Set “animal” as an assor donkey, specifically Equus africanus or the African wild ass, a species that is todaynearing extinction but which still survives in the deserts of Somalia and Ethiopiahaving once been common in the Egyptian desert as well. This species thrives in desertplaces and is largely identified with the sere wastelands outside of the ancient Egyptiancities. (Indeed, one of the magical spells that appear in the Papyrus London-Leidenmagical manuscripts specifically instructs the magician to use the blood and head of adonkey in order to evoke Set-Typhon.)80 It is claimed that the sound the donkey makes—its peculiar braying—gave rise to one of the most common utterances to be found inCrowleyan (and, indeed, most Gnostic and Greco-Roman occult) literature: Iao or Io,both of which were considered names of the Egyptian god Set in the Greco-Romanliterature and serve as invocations of that god.81Set has been associated with foreign countries and their inhabitants. Thus, thepeoples of Libya in the west were considered (by the Egyptians) to be followers of Set.The Semitic peoples of Mesopotamia in the east were also considered to be Set-"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"worshippers and their god, Baal, was identified often with Set. Crowley's prime femaledeity, Babalon, also is obviously Babylonian and authors have tried to identify thefamous “Whore of Babylon” of the Biblical Apocalypse as the Babylonian Ishtar(Sumerian Inanna). This would seem to justify to some extent Grant's (and Crowley's)insistence that the source of the Thelemic testament, Aiwass, was Sumerian and that hemight have been a priest of an Ur-form of Set-Typhon. If this could be supported byother evidence, then it is clear that Thelema owes a great deal of its identity to theinfluence of that exemplar of the transgressive forces of the universe ... and thatLovecraft's horror of the high priest of the Great Old Ones, Cthulhu or Kutulu, was atleast in some measure justified!In addition, it is tempting to see the Semitic word satan as a form of the EgyptianSet. They have the consonant sounds “s” and “t” in common, and they both seem torepresent evil beings. Actually, while the relationship is hypothetical at this point, thetwo words do have a lot in common. Add to that the general reluctance of Egyptianscribes to write out the name of Set phonetically82—but who instead chose to use hishieroglyphic signifier in texts—and you have an apt comparison to the avoidance ofpronouncing the initial consonant of Shaitan's name by the Yezidis. Both, incidentally,begin with the same consonantal sound: the initial or sound used for the name ofSet in transliterated Egyptian is believed to be identical to the sound s in Satan and shin Shaitan, respectively.The Hebrew word satan comes from a root meaning “adversary” or to “resist” aswell as “enemy”, “obstacle”, or “obstruction”, depending on whether the word is usedas a noun or a verb. It may come from the word sut which means “to fall aside oraway,” or the word set which means “one who revolts.” The final “n” in the Hebrewsatan indicates an emphasis on the root for the purpose of personification, and thus “hewho falls aside,” or “he who revolts,” or “he who obstructs.” We remember that one ofthe earliest suspected pronounciations for Set is indeed Sut.If it can be shown that Semitic ideas of Satan derive from the ancient Egyptian godSet, then Grant's hypothesis that Set-Shaitan-Typhon are one and the same takes onincreased importance. By identifying Aiwass with this signifier we may understand theBook of the Law a little better, particularly its controversial third chapter which setsthe New Aeon in complete opposition to the world's religions in a dramatic and evenviolent way. The message of Liber AL then becomes a message consistent with thepersonality and objectives of Set, the Dark Lord.On the other hand, there is a scene from the Book of Coming Forth by Day (morecommonly known as the Egyptian Book of the Dead) in which Set is shown at the prowof Ra's barque, fighting the serpent god Apophis. In this setting, Set is protecting theSun God, Ra. If Set is “evil” as is often claimed, how is it that he also can be depicteddefending the pantheon? Indeed, some pharaohs even took the name Set as their own oradded it to their titles."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Set as Tantric GodA recurrent theme in all of Grant's work is that of sexuality, especially within aritualistic context. The OTO is said to be a repository of the sexual secrets discoveredby its German founders a century ago, and the OTO's debt to the sacred spiritualityadvocated by the African-American mystic Pascal Beverly Randolph has been detailedelsewhere.83 Tantra forms the main context for Grant's elaboration of the sexualmysteries at the heart of Thelema and Thelemic magic, and indeed Grant went muchfurther than Crowley in his description of these mysteries and their relevance to Tantraand in particular to Vama Marg Tantra or “Tantra of the Left Hand Path” as it is often—erroneously—characterized. Grant's Tantra is not the New Age, feel-good, Tantra ofthe West, but the transgressive Tantra of the Nath Siddhis, the Kaula circles and othertraditions that view the human body—male and female—as both laboratories andtemples combined. Tantra according to this approach is a technology of spirituality,spiritual power, and tremendously altered states of consciousness which has as its goalcommunion with supramundane beings ... in other words, precisely what Love-craftdescribed when he depicted the orgiastic rites in the swamps outside New Orleans inhis short story “The Call of Cthulhu.”While many readers will be familiar with the legend of Set murdering Osiris, andIsis giving birth to a child, Horus, who will avenge his father's death in battle with Set,what is not so well known is the sexual component to the myth. For decades this aspecthas remained somewhat hidden from the non-academic world and buried in obscureLatin phrases and euphemisms and generally ignored. That Set was understood to beeither homosexual or at least bi-sexual will seem strange to those who have alwaysbelieved Set to be the personification of pure evil and murder, a kind of Jungian“Shadow” archetype. But Set as representative of “the Other” in almost everything alsorepresents sexual transgression, the perhaps ultimate expression of “Other-ness” and anatural characteristic of the type of Tantric sexuality that is the focus of Grant's thesis.To understand this—and its relevance to Grant's Typhonian magic—it is necessaryto know how Egypt described the origins of Set.According to one of the cosmological systems of the ancient Egyptians, the supremeor eldest god, Atum, gave birth to the world by self-propagating his two children, Shuand Tefnut, who in turn gave birth to Geb the earth god and Nut the sky goddess. Thesein turn gave birth to Osiris and Isis. However, they also gave birth to Set and Nephthys,which disturbed the order of the cosmos as, until that time, the system had beenestablished whereby one male-female pair gave birth to only one other male-femalepair, essentially what the Gnostics would refer to as syzygies. Further, it was claimedthat Set was not born via the usual method but essentially tore out of his mother's sideon his own volition in an untimely season and violent manner. Thus it appears—thoughis not specifically stated—that Set did not have a childhood per se but entered life"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"fully-grown. Even the word for “birth” is not used in the Egyptian texts in connectionwith Set's origins. Indeed, his own mother refused him and his sister/wife Nephthyswas also in horror of him. Isis, whose brother/husband Osiris was slain by Set, lived infear of him as well, especially during her pregnancy with Horus. It was believed thatSet (due to his unnatural birth) caused abortions and that he would “open the womb” ofpregnant women so that they would miscarry or abort. And even though each of themale-female pairs of gods would go on to beget other male-female pairs, Set andNephthys did not have children and Nephthys was characterized vulgarly as the onewith the “useless” vagina. Nephthys runs to Isis in fear of Set, or to console Isis afterthe murder of Osiris, a situation more fit for a telenovela than the gravitas of Egyptianreligious mysteries. Thus the Set and Nephthys couple or dyad represent the disorderof the universe; evil enters into the cosmos through their unnatural entrance into thepantheon and the carefully-crafted structure of the created world is ripped apart.Thus Set is the ultimate (and perhaps the original) anti-hero. His birth and earlyyears are models of rejection, abuse, and violence: rejected by his own family, he turnsto the abuse of them and their offspring and violently attacks and kills Osiris and thenwaits to do the same to Horus, his biological nephew.But not before sodomizing the Crowned and Conquering Child.There is little doubt today among Egyptologists that Set was characterized as ahomosexual god, and that the famous “Contendings of Horus and Set” contain anaccount of Set's attempt to sodomize his nemesis. In fact, this attempted act of sodomyis the foundation for such an iconic Egyptian motif as the Eye of Horus. Theseassociations were not generally known in Crowley's time outside a small circle ofspecialists. Had they been familiar to Crowley, they might have elicited a great manymore musings on such themes as sexual magic, the mysteries of the Aeons, and thedegree structure of the Ordo Templi Orientis. They certainly do lend support to suchclaims by later Crowley devotees that the New Aeon would be a “homosexual” Aeon,the males under the aegis of Typhon and the females under Maat.84It was the mother of Horus, Isis, who suggested to her son that he avoid penetrationby Set through the use of his fingers to cover his anus, thus capturing Set's semen inhis hand whereupon he flung the seed into a river. Set believed he had sodomizedHorus successfully, and in a strange turnabout Horus deposited his own semen on aleaf of lettuce (Set's favorite food). Set ate the lettuce and thereby was “penetrated”(orally, we observe) by Horus.When Set bragged to the gods that he had sodomized Horus, the semen that Horushad thrown into the river spoke out and denied Set the satisfaction of his boast. At thattime, Horus claimed that he had penetrated Set, and to prove it the semen that Set hadconsumed issued forth from Set's forehead as a white disk.Before the enraged Set could grab the disk it was seized by Thoth, the god of"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Wisdom, Magic, and Writing, and placed in the sky as the Moon.85While this episode certainly shows Set as an aggressive and violent being withhomosexual attributes, it is not the whole story. In other legends, Set is still violentsexually but in heterosexual as well as homosexual situations. It could be argued thatSet represents desire or sexuality per se. While Isis may be a symbol of love,especially maternal love, she is not usually identified in terms of pure sexuality. Set,on the other hand, seems to embody lust unrestrained.If we understand Set to represent raw sexuality we can realize Set's place in theEgyptian cosmos. Set is power, at its most primal and basic (“uncivilized”) humanlevel. Unrestrained, it results in rape and pedophilia among other depravations.Restrained, it can be a potent source of protection and occult power. But this powerlives in a wild and uninhabited place, outside of society, a wasteland of invisible windsand unseen beasts. Society uses this power when the need arises; at other times, itwants it to go away, to disappear—which is as good a description of modernhumanity's relationship to sexuality as any.It could be argued that our reaction to the concept of sexuality is based upon itsmore controversial aspects. From teen pregnancy and pedophilia to rape, adultery,abortion, pornography, prostitution, sexually-transmitted diseases, and even gaymarriage ... sexuality to the modern mind (West and East) is a minefield of dangerousassociations. Crowley himself has the reputation of being a polymorphously perverselibertine who engaged in virtually every form of sexual expression during the course ofhis lifetime and who had many multiple male and female sexual partners covering theentire spectrum of human society, from street corner prostitutes to celebrities, artists'smodels, poets, actresses, and wealthy matrons. This was Set, the Dark Lord and God ofthe Midnight Sky and the circumpolar stars of True North in eternal struggle withHorus, the Lord of the Sun, the East, and the ecliptic. Crowley, like Jacob before him,wrestled with an Angel on the Ladder leading up to heaven, only in Crowley's case itwas the Egyptian god that the Golden Dawn had taught him to fear and distrust, a godthat represented the very sexuality that Crowley championed as being the vehicle forattaining the True Mysteries. It was the god of the Black Mass, and the witches'ssabbat.It was this type of sexual expression that so horrified H. P. Lovecraft to the extentthat he never actually wrote about sexuality except in terms of disgust at the “orgiasticrites” of those worshipping the Ancient Ones. Lovecraft instinctively understood thatextreme or at least non-traditional forms of sexuality were somehow linked to magic,occult power, and contact with supramundane entities. Lovecraft's instincts thus arelinked to Crowley's magic and revelations to form Grant's Necronomicon Gnosis. Set,as the Lord of sexual transgression—which means any sexual activity outside oflawfully-permitted reproductive sex—is a Tantric Lord as well in the broadest sense ofthat term. Grant claimed that Set offers access to other dimensions, and that a deep"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"understanding of Tantra—coupled with western magical practice and analysis—wouldlead the magician to the dark side of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life.This “Setian” Tantra would re-interpret Set's infamous sexual acts as ritualrequirements designed to plunge the operator into a dangerous realm of consciousnessbelow that (or beyond that) of the waking world. These acts would include everythingfrom solitary sexual practices to various types of hetero- and homosexual acts,including oral and anal sex. While Grant has argued that the enigmatic XIth degree ofthe Ordo Templi Orientis did not involve anal penetration—insisting instead that theper vas nefandum (the “unmentionable vessel”) requirement in Crowley's allusions tothe ritual refers to the vagina of a woman during her menstruation, rather than to theanus, giving new meaning to the term “Scarlet Woman”—there is precedence forbelieving that many other forms of non-reproductive sex do have relevance for moderntantric practitioners. Shiva copulated extensively with his wife Parvati except that hedid not impregnate her in the usual way but ejaculated either in her hand or her mouth.These (and many other) episodes from both Egyptian and Indian religion would seemto indicate that forms of sexuality other than those intended for reproduction are beingimplied, and to many mainstream religions any sexual act that does not have as itsintention the reproduction of the species is, by definition, evil and forbidden.86 Thus,what we may call “sacred sexuality”—whether the pale and pastel mysticism of right-hand Tantra with its hours of silent and motionless meditation on the Shakti yantra, orthe red meat rituals of the Black Mass replete with bodily fluids and loud fornications,and everything in between—is transgressive by its very nature and belongs to therealm of the Dark Lord.This leads us into another ritual developed by Crowley and based, once again, uponthe rites of the Golden Dawn into which he had been initiated and which continued toinfluence his magical worldview his entire life. This is the Ritual of the Star Sapphire,known as Liber XXXVI (or “Book 36).First appearing in Crowley's Book of Lies, this ritual was designed to replace theGolden Dawn's Ritual of the Hexagram. The Golden Dawn had two foundational ritualsthat everyone was expected to learn and to perform: the first of these being the Ritualof the Pentagram which was used to invoke or banish—depending on the direction thepentagram was drawn—the four “Platonic” elements (earth, air, fire and water) plus“spirit.” Each of the five points of the pentagram was assigned to one of theseelements. It is the basic circle casting ritual of the Golden Dawn and versions of ithave been used widely in occult groups and practice for more than one hundred years.This includes Wiccan groups, whose members often are not aware of the origins oftheir rite which is sometimes called invoking the Watchtowers (a direct reference tothe Golden Dawn ritual, which was itself based on the Angelic Magic of Elizabethanmagician John Dee and his medium, Edward Kelly—of whom Crowley believed hewas the reincarnation)."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The other, more complex, ceremony is known as the Ritual of the Hexagram. In thisritual, each of the six points of the hexagram is assigned one of the six visible“planets,” with the center of the hexagram representing the sun. Thus, depending onhow the hexagram is drawn, one is invoking or banishing the influences of one of theplanets.Crowley replaced both of these rituals with his own, Thelemic, versions. ThePentagram ritual was replaced by the Star Ruby ritual whose original angelic beings—Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel—were substituted with godforms moreappropriate to Thelema: Therion (the “Beast”) Nuit, Babalon and Hadit.87However, when it came to the Hexagram ritual, a fundamental change took place,one that may not be particularly obvious at first glance. This was the ritual thatattracted the attention of Theodor Reuss, one of the founders of the OTO, who visitedCrowley in London and accused him of publishing the secret of the IX° of the Order inhis 1912 book The Book of Lies, a situation that led to Crowley's receiving the IX°from Reuss on the spot—and the rest, as they say, is history. Crowley had alreadyreceived the grades up to and including the VII° from Reuss, but had no idea that thehigher grades consisted of the sexual secrets that he had published. Crowley, in writingout these sexually-charged texts, was just being Crowley; he claimed that StarSapphire came to him in the same sort of heightened state of consciousness thatbrought forth the other Holy Books that we have discussed, above. It was Reuss whorevealed to him what has become the biggest “secret” of western occultism, that thecore of the practices—from alchemy to ceremonial magic—are sexual in nature, andthat the iconography of occultism (including Rosicrucianism, alchemy, mysticism andmagic) conceal sexual (or, at least, psycho-biological) secrets.Crowley went on to rewrite many of the OTO rituals, to become head of the Order inthe English-speaking countries, and eventually head of the Order itself after thecontentious Weida Conference in Germany. Thus, this particular ritual deserves closescrutiny as it was the catalyst that propelled Crowley to the headship of the OTO; it isalso, according to Reuss himself, the secret of the IX° in printed form. In addition, andmost importantly for this study, it is a ritual that puts Set—the Dark Lord—front andcenter.An entire book could be written on the Star Sapphire, as simple as it seems to be,and we will not explore all its implications and ramifications here. What concerns usdirectly is how Crowley perceived Set in his own Thelemic context.The ritual begins with the key phrase, “Let the Adept be armed with his MagickRood (and provided with his Mystic Rose).” This is the phrase the caught the attentionof Theodor Reuss. A “Magick Rood” of course is a rod or wand, and specifically refersto the cross on which Christ was crucified, the “Holy Rood.” Thus this first sentencetells the adept to be armed with a cross and a rose, which is the symbol of one of themost famous European secret societies, the Rosicrucians (which name means, of"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"course, Rose Cross or Rosey Cross). A rose and cross emblem was also the coat-of-arms of the man who ignited the Reformation, Martin Luther. Thus, we can see thisinstruction as being, if not wholly innocent, at least bereft of any overtly sexualconnotation if taken in the context of seventeenth-century European occult societies.However, the rest of the ritual puts this initial phrase into a completely differentcontext.After giving a number of quasi-Masonic gestures—the L.V.X. signs or the N.O.X.signs both of which have their origins in the Golden Dawn—the adept is theninstructed to go to the four cardinal directions, beginning with the East and proceedingclockwise to the other quarters, uttering a series of Latin phrases and drawing ahexagram in each direction.The Latin phrases are instructive. Translated, they are:Father and Mother, One God, ARARITA.Mother and Son, One God, ARARITA.Son and Daughter, One God, ARARITA.Daughter and Father, One God, ARARITA.Ararita is the same word that appears in the original Golden Dawn version of theHexagram ritual, and is an acronym for a Hebrew phrase that means “One is hisbeginning. One is his individuality. His permutation is One.”At the end, the adept returns to his original position in the center of the circle thusmade, and “making the sign of the Rosy Cross” he then repeats the word ARARITAthree times, after which he makes:“... the Sign of Set Triumphant and of Baphomet. Also shall Set appear in thecircle. Let him drink of the Sacrament and let him communicate the same.”There are further Latin phrases after this, which translated read:“All in Two; Two in One; One in none; these are neither Four nor All nor Twonor One nor None.”Followed by:“Glory be to the Father and the Mother and the Son and the Daughter and theHoly Spirit without and the Holy Spirit within which was, and is, and is to come,for ever and ever, six in one through the seven in one name ARARITA.”The emphasis in these phrases seems to be the reduction of all dualities to asingularity, evidence of Crowley's fascination with the Indian concept of advaita ornon-duality. Yet, duality is at the heart of the ritual, so it is worthwhile to pause here tocontemplate its intention."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"In the first place, remember that Crowley himself insisted that he did not realize thatthis was the IX° secret until Theodor Reuss pointed it out to him, and told him that itwas the secret behind all of western occultism. Crowley wrote it as a sexual rite andexpanded upon this intention in a later chapter88 of the Book of Lies, but was unawareof what he had stumbled upon. It may be that Crowley felt he was simply re-interpreting the rituals in sexual terms rather than discovering the real basis behindthem. But what does Set have to do with any of this? And why is Set “Triumphant”?If this ritual is interpreted in sexual terms, as was the intention, we are left with theuncomfortable realization that three of the four “pairings” are incestuous in nature:Mother and Son, Son and Daughter, Father and Daughter. Crowley was delicateenough, or pragmatic enough, not to have included “Mother and Daughter” or “Fatherand Son” most likely since heterosexual couplings would be necessary in a ritual of theIX° in which both male and female fluids are required for the creation of theSacrament. This Sacrament is to be consumed by the operator and “communicated.”The last word comes from the Latin Mass, and indicates that the Sacrament is to beshared, so that those sharing “commune” with the spiritual force invoked. In the LatinMass this is done with the sacred Elements—the bread and wine that have beentransubstantiated into the body and blood of Christ—so that all those whocommunicate (i.e., take Communion) share in the experience of contact with Jesus, theslain and resurrected God.In the case of the Star Sapphire, since the ritual is patently sexual, the Sacrament iscomposed of the male and female sexual fluids and is a form of the Gnostic Mass inminiature, as it were. What Grant points out, again and again in his TyphonianTrilogies, is that these are not simply the gross fluids in and of themselves, but havebeen transformed through correct performance of ritual. They thus contain occultqualities which normal semen and female secretions (whether menstrual blood or thesecretions of the mucus membranes of the vagina—which are carriers of specialessences known as kalas to Tantra and to Grant) normally do not possess. Thesequalities have nothing to do with the process of physical reproduction; they areobviously not necessary to facilitate the conception of a human child. An essentialelement of this ritual (and, indeed, of all sexual magic) is contact with other forces,those beyond the physical world, so that all the grosser physical aspects of sexualintercourse (from desire, to arousal, to intercourse, to orgasm, to the fluids that result)must be re-imagined, transformed, and transcended.As a ritual of transgressive sexuality, it would be appropriate for Set. Set is“triumphant”—according to the Egyptian texts so far deciphered—in situations ofmurder, rape, sodomy, etc. In Set's defence of Ra's solar barque, his violence is put togood use in service of the pantheon, and he is triumphant there as well: he destroys aserpent god, Apep or Apophis (with whom, paradoxically, he is sometimes identified)."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"In the Star Sapphire ritual, it may be that the transgressive powers of Set are firstidentified and then employed in an act designed to bring the adept into contact with hisHoly Guardian Angel (as Crowley himself seems to suggest in Chapter 69 of the Bookof Lies—where the subject of the Hexagram is discussed in terms that are patentlysexual and obvious, including an explicit reference to the sexual position known as“69” or mutual oral sex).The Golden Dawn instructions concerning the Hexagram ritual make it clear thatthis is a ritual of the macrocosm (the seven planets, seven of the ten sefirot on the Treeof Life), as opposed to the Pentagram ritual which is a rite of the microcosm (the fourelements plus spirit, or the five Indian tattvas). We may say, then, that the Hexagramritual (both the Golden Dawn original and Crowley's reworking of it in the StarSapphire) is a ritual of the heavens, the sky, and the Pentagram ritual is of the earth.Therefore, the invocation of Set Triumphant at the climax of the rite indicates theunlocking of a Gate between this world and the next, a Gate that is not quite the sameas that which Osiris would have unlocked. It has nothing to do with death andresurrection, per se, but of opening a portal to the Nightside of the Tree of Life, to whatGrant refers to as the Tunnels of Set. Here once again Crowley has demonstrated thetrue nature of his mythos, moreover in a ritual that was written in a heightened state ofconsciousness similar to that which gave us the Book of the Heart Girt with a Serpent:the book that formed the link between Crowley the magician and Lovecraft the seer.That there is the performance of a sexual act in the center of the ceremony and theconsumption of the “Elements” thereafter is only another piece of evidence thatGrant's understanding of the Thelemic praxis as representing contact with the DarkLord is the correct one.In religion, humans are subservient to God or the Gods, especially in the Abrahamic,monotheistic religions. In Thelema, the emphasis is reversed with all the focus onhuman potential. There is no religious dogma in magic, as much as it might seem to beimplied. Magicians dare to do what religious, pious human beings do not: to activelyapproach the Thrones of the Gods using whatever means are available, even the mostblasphemous. The Gods may be more powerful, and even dangerous, but the properlytrained human being can navigate the heavens and the hells with impunity.Chaos and Babalon—we might say Set and Ishtar, Dumuzi and Inanna, Shiva andShakti—represent the deepest occult processes that lie beneath the play of Maya, of theIllusory World of Creation. Chaos and Babalon are also the gateways to the Dark Sideof Creation, just as human sexuality is a gateway to deeper unconscious processes thatfunction—powerfully—below the horizon of conscious thought, calculation, andconjecture. They are irrational forces, which is the characteristic that alarmedLovecraft the most: they were immune to sober, scientific understanding just as theimmense vastness of deep space lies outside the ability of the human mind tocontemplate."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The other Gods—Isis, Osiris, Horus, Thoth, Anubis, the list goes on and on and notonly for Egyptian deities but also the Greek, Roman, African, Indian, Chinese and somany other pantheons—are aspects of the basic and fundamental two, of Chaos andBabalon. For convenience, they can be considered refinements of specific aspects,points of view, chemical components, psycho-biological qualities—but that is not todenigrate their importance or value to the magician. Any one of these deities is apotent force far in excess of any human capacity to contain completely.The Typhonian Tradition—according to Grant's thesis—is the most ancient of allreligious and occult traditions. Its origin is in the stars, and it lies at the base of alllater cults. That would indicate that its gods are the basis for all later gods, its ritualsthe purer forms of all later rituals. But that would be to deny that human beings arecapable of refining those ancient rites from time to time, of fine-tuning the originalprocesses for reasons of self-preservation, if nothing else. For Grant is not entirelyoptimistic concerning the designs of the ultramundane, extraterrestrial forces of whichhe writes so eloquently. His works are not only guides through the Tunnels of Set tothe Dark Side of the Tree of Life: they are also warnings, warnings as sincere as thoseof Lovecraft were fanciful.And in order to understand those forces, it is necessary to see how they wereinvoked by a plethora of “unspeakable cults” around the world, in rituals secret and attimes profane.43 Durkheim (1912) p. 3944 There are other attainments beyond the Knowledge and Conversation of the HGA, and they will be discussedas they come up.45 Evidence for this may be found in the Sumerian Maqlu text, the “Burning” grimoire that consists of spellsagainst “witches” which may be taken to mean independent spiritual experts who work on behalf of individuals—for love, money, power, etc—rather than for the group. An abbreviated form of this text appears in theSchlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon.46 Crowley's approach can be characterized as bricolage, after its use as a term of art in cultural studies andanthropology, notably by Claude Levi-Strauss (The Savage Mind, 1962). This refers to a method of takingwhatever is useful at the time from whatever source and building a system or a philosophy out of the assembledparts. Anyone reading Crowley's vast published work will readily come to the conclusion that Crowley indeed wasa bricoleur par excellence. Of course, central to the ritual environment of the Golden Dawn—the occult societythat gave Crowley his first initiations—was the doctrine of correspondences, in which disparate religious andspiritual elements were given equivalence through the medium of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. This, in a sense,was a systematized form of bricolage.47 He used the Golden Dawn grade system as the template for his own AA Both degree systems are basedon a version of the Tree of Life of the Kabbalists.48 Crowley's instructions to his disciples on these techniques form the substance of his Book Four which iscompletely focused on yoga and which—in Crowley's system—became an important adjunct to the more westernceremonial practices of the Golden Dawn. Along with Book Four were his Eight Lectures on Yoga in which hedevelops these ideas even more specifically. In a sense, the yogic methods were the missing element in thegrimoires which simply gave the rituals as recipes to be followed by those already trained in yoga (or in somecorresponding form of mental and physiological control represented in the western, European systems by fasting,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"celibacy, prayer, etc.).49 This may be due to the emphasis put on samadhi in The Yoga Aphorisms of Patanjali, a Hindu text of whichCrowley was fond and which he recommended to his followers. It is also an essential aspect of Buddhistmeditation, and references to it can be found in the Sikh religion as well.50 This excerpt from Crowley's Book Four is illustrative of his contempt for Buddhism: “The vulgarism andprovincialism of the Buddhist canon is infinitely repulsive to all nice minds; and the attempt to use the terms of anego-centric philosophy to explain the details of a psychology whose principle doctrine is the denial of the ego, wasthe work of a mischievous idiot.” (p. 80, footnote)51 One can compare the Biblical Book of Revelation (Apocalypse) with documents discovered at Qumran, such asthe Song of the Sabbath Sacrifice, for similar predictions of a great cosmic battle and the loss of the Temple ofSolomon in Jerusalem.52 More properly referred to as “isopsephy” when applied to the Greek language and alphabet.53 This idea would be adopted and elaborated upon by the cult around Crowley's contemporary, Maria deNaglowska (1883-1936) in Paris, as well as by the German offshoot of the original OTO, the Fraternitas Saturniand even the groups around the Italian mystic and fascist ideologue Julius Evola (1898-1974). The influence ofthese groups on the OTO and eventually on Thelema cannot be discounted or ignored, and even may contribute toa fuller understanding of Thelema, as well as an expansion of its major themes. See Chapter 5.54 Another French depiction of a Black Mass can be found in the twentieth century novel by Georges Bataille,L'histoire de l'oeil—“The History of the Eye”—which is concerned with sexual as well as religious transgression. Itwas published in 1928, and contains scenes in which sexual fluids are intermingled in such a way as to suggestsome of the deeper mysteries of the western Tantric-influenced cults.55 The word “bond” in this context expands upon the definition of religio and ligare, given above, but moreimportantly it may reflect a modern iteration of Giordano Bruno's revealing text, De vinculis in genera (“Of Bondsin General”). Here Bruno identifies the “bond” as love or eros, and especially in a magical context, thus agreeingcompletely with AL I:41 in which “bond” is equated with “love.” Bruno was burned at the stake by the CatholicChurch in the year 1600 for heresy.56 In this Crowley was anticipating the revolutionary psychological theories of Deleuze and Guattari in their Anti-Oedipus, where they argue that families and society at large conspire to repress desire and act as vehicles ofneuroses which are necessary to the smooth functioning of capitalist society. In such a situation schizophrenia isthe only logical outcome. See also R. D.

In this tradition, a shaman is one who has undergone the death andrebirth experience after a long period of meditation and solitary ritual in the forest. The death and rebirth formula isalso an integral part of the initiation structure of the Golden Dawn and of Aleister Crowley's AA, as well asof the third degree of Freemasonry. In that sense one could say that anyone who has gone through these systemscan be called a “kusulu,” but there is a difference between the formalized rituals of the western esoteric traditionand the intense psychological experience of genuine Asian shamanistic initiation.72 Liber XXXVI is also known as The Star Sapphire, see below.

Set-Typhon occupies one of the Invisible Stations in this ritual,where he is described as “Omoo-Sathan, Typhon, Apophis, Set. The Evil Persona is a composite figure of thepowers arising from the Qlippoth...” The other two stations on this Path—on the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life,the segment named Samekh after the Hebrew letter—are Hathor and Harparkrat. Hathor is sometimes considered aconsort of Set and a partner in his drunken revels; the presence of Harparkrat (Harpocrates or Hoor-paar-krat, thechild form of Horus) along with Set and Hathor is a dead give-away as to the true nature of the Aeon of Horus.

His work islike the conversation of a maniac—it runs with startling clarity for awhile, thensuddenly merges into vagueness and disconnected ramblings.”Conrad shook his head. “Have you ever thought that perhaps it is his verysanity that causes him to write in that fashion? What if he dares not put on paperall he knows? What if his vague suppositions are dark and mysterious hints,keys to the puzzle, to those who know?”“Bosh!” This from Kirowan. “Are you intimating that any of the nightmarecults referred to by Von Junzt survive to this day—if they ever existed save inthe hag-ridden brain of a lunatic poet and philosopher?”“Not he alone used hidden meanings,” answered Conrad.—Robert E. Howard, “The Children of the Night” (1931)ROBERT E. HOWARD WAS ONE of the circle of fantasy authors around H. P. Lovecraftsometimes referred to as the Lovecraft Circle. He contributed to what has becomeknown as the “Cthulhu Mythos” by writing stories such as the one excerpted abovewhich referenced Lovecraft's Cthulhu, the Necronomicon, and other motifs. One of hiscontributions to the Mythos was the fictional Nameless Cults by Von Junzt, whichbecame the awkward Unaussprechlichen Kulten89 in Lovecraft's German rescensionand from there into “Unspeakable Cults.” Howard's most famous creation, however,was Conan the Barbarian, the fantasy character made even more famous by the actorArnold Schwarzenegger. In 1936, at the age of 30, Howard committed suicide. He wasnot the only member of Lovecraft's inner circle to do so. In 1951 he would be followedby Robert H. Barlow, the noted anthropologist of ancient Mexico, expert in the Nahuatllanguage, and the literary executor of Lovecraft's estate. He committed suicide inMexico at the age of 32.One of the prevailing themes in Grant's work (and especially in that of Lovecraft and"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"his circle of fellow gothic horror writers) is of cults that are either African, Afro-Caribbean, Middle Eastern or Asian. In other words, cults that could be defined as non-Western. While Crowley speaks of these cults in passing, he does not focus on them tothe extent that Grant does, and Grant does so because he feels that the practices andbeliefs of these cults hold keys towards understanding underlying themes andtechniques of occultism in general and Thelema specifically.Thelema's origins, as described in the previous two chapters, can be found in theinterpretation of Egyptian mysteries by the British organizers of the Golden Dawn, thesecret society in which Crowley was initiated, and their reevaluation and re-imagination by Crowley himself. Most of the religious references in the Book of theLaw are to Egyptian god forms familiar to anyone who had been through the initiatorysystem of the Golden Dawn.But there are tantalizing references to other schemes of initiation in AL, and whileCrowley did immerse himself for awhile in Asian methods of magic and mysticism hisfocus always remained on those systems that were most familiar to Westerners, andthose elements of Asian systems that were already in translation in English. He hadvirtually no background in African or Afro-Caribbean systems. He was thus limited inhis ability to draw the same inferences and conclusions of later occultists who hadaccess to greater resources, either in translation or through direct experience of thenon-Western systems.This is beginning to be rectified, and it is largely to Grant that we owe thisexpansion of Thelemic ideas, methods, and practices into non-Western systems ofinitiation, and vice versa.However, while the intellectual composition of Thelema has been extended greatlythrough Grant's work, it is through the creative and visionary accomplishments of H. P.Lovecraft that we owe the emotional content, albeit in ways the horror writer neverconsciously intended.“Weird fiction seems to vie with works on witchcraft, voodoo and dark magic.”—Robert E. Howard, “The Children of the Night”It is the contention of this writer, as well as of Kenneth Grant, that Lovecraft insome way—unconsciously, probably—was in touch with, or otherwise aware of, thesame spiritual material that informed Crowley's contact in Cairo in 1904. We haveseen in the previous chapter how closely events in Lovecraft's “Call of Cthulhu”mirrored Crowley's Holy Book revelations. There are other parallels, and othersynchronicities, between the two writers and as we proceed with this investigation wewill look at some of them. What is compelling about these correspondences is that theone amplifies and explains the other. Grant's genius lay in making those initialconnections between the horror writer on the one hand and the Prophet of the New Age"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"on the other. It was a bold contention, for it was in danger of making modern occultismlook like some kind of role-playing game, a sword-and-sorcery affair replete withscary monsters and secret books.Several of the cults most important to Lovecraft's stories are precisely those thatintrigue both Crowley and Grant. These include the Haitian religion of Voodoo (alsospelled variously vodou, vodun, etc.) and the Mesopotamian religion of the Yezidi.“Voodoo” makes its appearance in Lovecraft's “Call of Cthulhu” as well as throughoutGrant's published work. Grant's interest in this Afro-Caribbean religion was intensifiedthrough his relationship with Michael Bertiaux (b. 1935) of La Couleuvre Noire (the“Black Snake”), an occult order based on Haitian Vodou with ideas and methodsderived from the Western mystery traditions as well as Lovecraftian and Thelemicelements."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Syncretisms, OrientalismsBertiaux had spent some time in Haiti before embracing his own particular occult path,and became a member of a society—the Ordo Templi Orientis Antiqua or OTOA—allegedly created by a mysterious and possibly non-existent Haitian occultist Lucien-François Jean-Maine (1869?-1960) of whom there is very little hard information. TheOTOA was evidently a mixture of quasi-Masonic ritual and initiation and traditionalVodun, forming a bridge between European-style ceremonial magic traditions and theAfro-Carib-bean Vodun cultus. Jean-Maine was allegedly the inheritor of an ancientHaitian occult lineage that numbers among its lineage-holders the venerable Ordre desElus-Cohen which had a branch in Leogane, Haiti. This is not the place to go into thehistory of the Elus Cohen (or “Elect Priests”), so suffice it to say that it was a branchof the eighteenth century Martinist order and the branch most closely concerned withritual magic. Martinism began as a Masonic-type society in pre-revolutionary Francebut its founder—Martinez de Pasqually—died in Haiti in 1774. Haiti at that time was aFrench colony. Hence the suggested French Masonic-Haitian Vodun connection.Bertiaux worked and expanded upon the system he inherited, and brought it into linewith Thelema by 1972. His Vodoun Gnostic Workbook became quite well-known for itsimaginative combination of western esotericism, Afro-Caribbean concepts andterminology, and sex magic. Kenneth Grant saw in Bertiaux's work a verification of hisbelief that the Thelemic magical current had to be allinclusive if it represented agenuine change of Aeon. That meant that analogues had to be found in African, LatinAmerican and Asian traditions as well as the more familiar European and MiddleEastern practices. Not only that, but these traditions would also hold keys to the fullimplementation of the current, based on their knowledge of occult matters andtechnologies stemming from their own environment, culture, and history and whichmight be either ignored or missing in western systems. Knowledge, to Grant, is power.As we mentioned above, Crowley's own knowledge of these practices was thin. Thisis not to criticize Crowley, for deep understanding of these mystical technologies hadalways eluded Western observers and there were few who had the requisite backgroundin the languages and rituals of India, Africa, and the indigenous cultures of allcontinents in the early twentieth century. That would gradually change, and by thebeginning of the twenty-first century a growing number of religious studies andanthropology scholars have made tremendous inroads into Chinese, Tibetan,Mongolian, African, and Afro-Caribbean languages and scriptures, both written andoral. Grant's contribution was to make as much use as possible of the growing body ofesoteric literature in translation from Asian and African sources in order to elaborateupon Thelemic themes and to create a more powerful ritual machinery for probing thedarker side of occultism.Thus, not only the Haitian religious system known as Vodun but also primary source"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"material on Tantric practices make their way into Grant's grand design. These elementswere always there in Crowley's writings and even in Liber AL itself, of course. Butbefore Grant the focus primarily had been on the Egyptian, Kabbalistic and to someextent alchemical characteristics of Thelemic ritual and concepts. Bertiaux—and theTantric expert David Curwen—were able to contribute to Grant's knowledge of non-European occultism in important ways.Heretofore, the occult or esoteric practices of any culture were basically consistentwith that culture and it's religious and magical ideas. This was the case even whenthere was obvious borrowing, such as within the syncretic faiths (such as Santeria,Vodun, etc.) where there was an admixture of foreign components with an indigenousbelief system. The power of magic rests, however, in its antinomian nature: it lives onthe outer limits of what is traditional, acceptable, “normal,” and legal. WhileGnosticism, for instance, can be understood as a kind of Christian esotericism, itborrowed heavily from Egyptian and Platonic sources, sources that would have beenanathema to orthodox Christians.But this type of syncretism was a result of neighboring cultures meeting each otherand borrowing from the religious and esoteric practices of the other. What is proposedin Grant's project is nothing less than a borrowing from whatever source, wherever inthe world, and whenever it existed. There is no sense of geographic proximity resultingin adulteration of one method or another, but of the deliberate search through theworld's religions, esotericisms, mysticisms and magics for methods that can beadapted to the overall agenda of Thelema. While this seems to have been Crowley'soriginal intention—as reflected, for instance, in the tables of correspondences betweenthe world's religions that can be found in Liber 777, a project begun by members of theGolden Dawn and greatly expanded by Crowley—it would be Grant who would makethis type of deliberate and conscious syncretism a cornerstone of his cult.Leaders of religions may quarrel with each other over beliefs and dogma; devoteesof religions may fight and kill each other over their differences; but mysticsunderstand each other, regardless of their formal affiliation. Mystics are interested intechniques for achieving altered states of consciousness that can lead them to greaterand deeper understanding. The attempt by some in Thelemic circles to forge bondsbetween Tantra, Vodun, Kabbalah, ceremonial magic, and alchemy represents thispoint of view. This is not—and should not be—an attempt to find justification for oneparticular dogma over another, or to prop up one particular interpretation over another.It is, instead, a quest for truth in the discovery of workable techniques. Magicians areinterested only in what works. Like scientists from both sides during the Cold War,there is curiosity and a willingness to learn from potential enemies as well as fromfriends.The danger in this approach lies in the facile comparisons made between differentcultures as if their gods and rituals had exact equivalents among those in another"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"completely different culture. There is evidence of this in Liber 777 and the tables ofcorrespondences which demonstrate the creators were often too quick to makeassociations between deities that may or may not have much in common. Thistendency has been called “universalism” by the post-modern critics who insteademphasize ethnic and cultural originality and uniqueness. Both of these approaches—in their extreme manifestations—are equally erroneous, in my view.What Grant has done is to cull these different techniques and approaches in order todiscover knowledge that cultures other than his own had obtained through the use ofmethods that might have been neglected in the West due to ignorance or tabu. This isespecially true when it comes to occult or esoteric techniques that are sexually-basedor based upon a knowledge of human anatomy and physiology that has been put to useby those who perceived a spiritual analogue to physical properties and functions.While a Western bias has been to downgrade the importance of the human body, or tosee the human body as a potential source of sin and transgression, the Asian andAfrican viewpoints reflect a respect for the body and an interest in examiningbiological functions in terms of their spiritual potential, or their potential for attaininghigher—or simply altered—states of consciousness.Thus, sexuality and drugs became the province of non-Western esoteric practicesafter the rise of Christianity in Europe repressed and suppressed these ideas. Whilethere is much more to Asian and African forms of spirituality and esotericism thansexuality and drugs, these represented the missing pieces in the Western repetoire.The story of the OTO has the founders traveling to the Middle East to obtaininitiations in “sex magic” and related methods. Pascal Beverly Randolph (a majorinfluence on modern Western esotericism) also claimed Middle Eastern initiations,and Aleister Crowley himself traveled through North Africa and India—as well asCeylon—in search of African and Asian wisdom.Grant, however, took a more organized approach to the subject and began collectingpreviously-unknown or untranslated esoteric texts from these cultures as well asbuilding relationships with those who had already been initiated into those traditions.This included Michael Bertiaux and David Curwen, as we shall see. But Grant did notstop there.Other forms of creative spirituality were not immune to Grant's all-inclusiveapproach. Art and literature represented, for Grant, additional avenues to explore forgreater understanding of the Thelemic project as well as a source of other technologiesthat could become part of the magician's arsenal.Thus, the art of Austin Osman Spare (1886-1956) was given as much regard inGrant's cult as the writings of H. P. Lovecraft. While Lovecraft described the“hideous” practices of Asian and African cults in words, Spare canonized them in hisart and his magical system. Grotesque human forms engaged in obscure ritual arepowerful images in Spare's magical worldview, just as grotesque alien beings hold"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"blind, omnipotent sway over humans in Lovecraft's world. Even more to the point,Spare understood that words—Lovecraft's metier—have intrinsic magical power aswell, and could be manipulated in such a way that the physical representation of a wordor phrase could acquire occult potency. It was an attempt to use words as art forms, toreduce words to the ideas they represent: to bring them back to their original status assymbols, as hieroglyphics. Spare's system was atavistic: a going-back in time to theperiod when writing was first being invented, a time when the written word heldtremendous magical power and could be interpreted only by the initiates, the priests.In this, Spare's system was as much a reference to ancient cults as it was anidiosyncratic occult method of his own devising. This was probably what attractedGrant in the first place, for Spare was a unique individual with a non-denominationalapproach to occultism. There was no formal Kabbalah in Spare's system, no nod toJewish or Christian contexts. Instead, it was a kind of orientalist fantasy of occultismand acted as a reach beyond texts as such to the deeper layers of consciousness whereour fears and our anxieties (and our sexuality) are located ... somewhere in the limbicbrain, perhaps, curled around itself at the top of the spinal cord.One of the iconic forms of this type of “orientalist fantasy” is the emphasis given tothe Kurdish cult of the Yezidi. Since Grant devotes an entire chapter to the Yezidi inhis Outer Gateways, it behooves us to investigate this religion further and to try toseparate the wheat from the chaff."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The Cult of the Peacock AngelI read of it first in the strange book of Von Junzt, the German eccentric wholived so curiously and died in such grisly and mysterious fashion. It was myfortune to have access to his Nameless Cults in the original edition, the so-calledBlack Book, published in Dusseldorf in 1839, shortly before a hounding doomovertook the author.—Robert E. Howard, “The Black Stone”... he thought the ritual was some remnant of Nestorian Christianity tincturedwith the Shamanism of Thibet. Most of the people, he conjectured, were ofMongoloid stock, originating somewhere in or near Kurdistan—and Malonecould not help recalling that Kurdistan is the land of the Yezidis, last survivorsof the Persian devil-worshippers.—H. P. Lovecraft, “The Horror at Red Hook”The Yezidis and the Tibetans. This same comparison would be made by KennethGrant decades later, and not in a fictional sense but entirely seriously. While rumors ofthe Yezidi made their way into European travelogues and archaeological literature inthe nineteenth century,90 it wasn't until the early days of the twentieth century that theybecame better known and the subject of one book that set the tone for so many future“revelations”: Isya Joseph's Devil Worship: The Sacred Books and Traditions of theYezidiz. Published in 1919, Joseph's book contained the first English versions of theBlack Book and the Revelation: two previously secret and unpublished texts said to bethe core scriptures of the Yezidi faith and which, according to Joseph, were translatedfrom the Arabic. These texts are referenced in Grant's books and in other occult andesoteric works that touch on the Yezidi cultus.Recent scholarship, however, has shown that these two texts are most likely theresult of a hoax perpetrated by a well-known antiquities dealer and forger ofdocuments and are not actual Yezidi texts.91 The Yezidi are said to possess what islargely an oral tradition, composed of many disparate elements including—but notlimited to—those of Christian, Islamic, Jewish and possibly Gnostic and Zoroastrianbeliefs and practices. While they do speak of a “Black Book” that was written inheaven, their religion is based less on doctrine and more on the correct observance ofritual. That said, it is also generally agreed that the texts of the published “BlackBook” and “Book of Revelation” do accurately reflect the basic beliefs of the mainYezidi clans even though they are not genuine Yezidi scriptures.Grant first mentions the Yezidi at the very outset of his nine-volume series onThelemic magic, in The Magical Revival first published in 1972. It is clear from thisbook and virtually all his subsequent works that he considered the Yezidi a core"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"influence and an important spiritual tradition with links to Thelema and specifically toCrowley and Aiwaz. However—except for a single chapter in Outer Gateways—herepeats himself on the subject without adding any new material or justifying hisconcentration on the Yezidi. Much of his information is taken either from Joseph'swork or from stray remarks by Massey, etc.The basic ideas are these:First, the whole attraction of the Yezidi for both Crowley and Grant is the idea thatthey are devil worshippers. If not for this, they most probably would have been ignored—not only by Crowley and Grant but by a number of nineteenth-century explorers whomention them in travelogues on the Kurdish tribal areas. If there was an ancient sect inthe Middle East that had been worshipping the devil since time immemorial, it wouldbe an important element of fin-de-siecle orientalist fantasies about the Black Mass,satanism, and witchcraft.Second, Grant has the idea—an echo of references found in Massey—that the Yezidiare descendants of the ancient Akkadian and Sumerian cultures that represent some ofthe oldest (if not the oldest) civilizations in the world of which we have any writtenrecord, predating even the Egyptians. This fascination with “origins” is one of thehallmarks of the universalist approach to the study of religion and culture, and is also acomponent of ideas concerning spiritual succession and lineage (i.e., spiritualauthority).The first of these ideas—that the Yezidi are “devil worshippers”—is connected tothe fact that Shaitan is an important element of the Yezidi belief-system. Shaitan—or“Satan”—is the Fallen Angel who rebelled against God when humans were elevated inimportance above the angels. To the Yezidi, Satan will be the first of God's creatures toenter heaven as he will be the first to be forgiven. This reverence for Shaitan isreflected in the tabu associated with the sound “sh” with which the word Shaitanbegins. Yezidi avoid using that sound as much as possible because of its connection.This has led to the misunderstanding that the Yezidi actually worship Shaitan, orSatan. Yet, another point of view on the subject is that the name Shaitan is so sacred—and therefore unpronounceable by the pious—that another form of address andidentification had to be created to take its place in normal conversation. While it seemslikely that the Yezidi do worship (or at least reverence) Shaitan, and are aware of hisdemonic associations, they do not associate Shaitan with evil. Shaitan's “sin” was inrefusing to bow down before Man, claiming that he would bend the knee to no otherbut God as that is what God had commanded from the beginning. So God punishedShaitan for disobeying his second command while honoring him for his commitmentto obeying the first command, thus ensuring that Shaitan would be the first creature tobe redeemed.The chief (pronounceable) object of worship among the Yezidi is known as MelekTa'us,92 the so-called “Peacock Angel,” and has become another focus of Grant's work"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"—as he associates the peacock with a host of entities and ideas that reinforce hisoverall concept of a Dark Lord. This is a subject we will examine shortly, but someobservers have claimed that Melek Ta'us and Shaitan are one and the same. Indeed, thecosmologies and creation stories of the Yezidi tend to support this idea at times, and tocontradict it at others. In the absence of a written text, this confusion (at least tooutsiders) is inevitable.The second issue of importance to Grant is the idea that the Yezidi are somehowdescendants or survivors of the Sumerians. Grant's equation can be summarized as:Sumer = Yezidi = Satan = Aiwass. In order to address this idea we have to ask: who arethe Yezidi, and where did they come from?This is a controversial area for ethnologists, politicians, anthropologists andhistorians of religion alike. The Yezidi themselves claim an origin variously in Indiaor in Sumer; to split the difference, there is a claim that they came from India toSumer, and are descendants of the Sumerians themselves.93 That they are presentlyconsidered a Kurdish clan is based mostly on their language—most Yezidi speak aform of Kurdish known as Kurmanji—and upon the fact that their tribal lands arewithin Kurdish territory in northern Iraq and are often counterminous with Kurdishlands in other areas in Syria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, etc. This connection may also bedue to the fact that the Kurds in general are subject to varying degrees ofdiscrimination and outright genocide (such as under the regime of Saddam Hussein inIraq) and the Yezidis are easily one of the most discriminated-against clans in theworld.The problem of the origins of the Yezidis as well as the nature of their religiousphilosophy is compounded by the fact that their leaders seem to say different things todifferent people, as is evidenced by the wide variety of academic and journalisticsources that all seem to contradict each other on essential points. The lack of adefinitive written scripture only adds to the confusion among outside observers.Combine this with the violent upheavals to which the Yezidis have been subjected overhundreds of years and which entailed the loss of land, documents, and the neargenocide of their people on religious and political grounds, and it is a wonder that theyhave survived as long as they have and that their sacred shrine of Lalish—believed bythem to be the center of the universe—still stands in northern Iraq, near the Turkishborder.For our purposes, however, there are actually several pieces of circumstantialevidence that indicate the Yezidis are closer to Grant's concept of them than firstappear. In the first place, we remember from the previous chapter that the Egyptiangod Set was fond of lettuce and that is how he was tricked into consuming the semen ofHorus. Oddly, the consumption of lettuce is tabu among the Yezidis. The “exoteric”explanation for this is that the word for lettuce sounds too similar to the name of oneof their prophets. But if the name Shaitan is indeed a version of the Egyptian name Set,"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"then the lettuce tabu makes perfect sense.Another strange coincidence lies in the fact that the Kurdish word for “God” isKhudâ or “Lord.”94 We cannot help but recognize the similarity between Khudâ andKutu, the Sumerian word for the Biblical city of Gudua or Cutha, which—according tothe Schlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon—is the basis for the name ofLovecraft's Cthulhu or “Man of Cutha” or “Man of Kutu”: Kutulu. Cutha was ruled bythe Sumerian god Nergal and was believed to be the gate to the Underworld, whichonce again supports a Sumerian or Babylonian connection to the Yezidis who do, afterall, live in a region that was once part of the Babylonian empire. Indeed, the ancientsite of Nineveh95 is not far from Lalish and the modern Iraqi city of Mosul.All that said, while there is no proof that the Yezidis are descendants of theSumerians or even from another migrating tribe from northern India or Persia, theirreligion and culture is distinct from Islamic, Christian, and Jewish practices andtheologies. One of their most revered leaders—Sheikh Adi—was by most accounts aSufi mystic. While many observers agree that the Yezidi religion is syncretistic—acombination of various elements from other religious practices including mostprobably Persian Zoroastrianism, in some ways like Santeria and other Afro-Caribbeanreligions that mixed Roman Catholic iconography and ritual with indigenous Africanbelief systems—the Sufi element is one that probably encouraged the incorporation ofantinomian and even transgressive beliefs, such as the idea that the Fallen Angel willbe the first to be redeemed along with the Yezidis. It was after all Sufism that was thefirst Islamic presence in the islands of Java and Sumatra in the fifteenth century (andearlier) and its influence can be seen there today in such practices as visiting graves,reverencing saints, etc. which are also hallmarks of Yezidism but which are notaccepted Islamic practice. In fact, Grant himself seems to make the connectionbetween syncretistic forms of religion, expanded consciousness, and contact withsupramundane entities when he writes:The Amenta of the Egyptians is identical to the Agharta of the Mongols. Thelatter with their pre-Buddhistic Bön complex, and shamanistic rites with Tantricimplicits, produced a weird combination of savage grotesquery and the profoundmetaphysical adumbrations of the SÛnyâtavâda. ... It is therefore in the Eskimo-shamanistic and the Bön impregnated Buddhism of Tibet, Mongolia, Java andSumatra, that the fundamental tenets of the Madhyamaka—as permeating theNyingmapa and Drukpa Cults—are relevant to the Necronomicon Gnosis.96Without going into detail on the definitions of the Buddhist terms, the firstimpression one gets from that passage is that Grant is playing fast and loose with hisattributions by linking Amenta (the Egyptian land of the Dead) to Agharta, the fabledunderground city believed hidden somewhere in the Himalayas.97 That there may be aclose connection between the indigenous Bön religion of Tibet and Tantric practices is"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"being debated by scholars of the literature; as is the idea that Bön is a survival of anolder, shamanistic cult which certainly seems to be the case. Grant's boldness,however, lies more in making the case that Tibetan Buddhism (which is primarilyTantric) is somehow cognate with Egyptian mysteries and the Necronomicon; and that“savage grotesquery” and “profound metaphysical adumbrations” can combine to forma new kind of spiritual methodology. But this is Grant's forte.Modern western magic is a refusal to accept the position of post-modernism thateach culture is unique and owes nothing to other cultures, even when similar ideas,symbols, and rituals are involved. As a magical operator in the modern world, one hasto embrace a kind of neo-universalism in which one recognizes the existence of asymbol structure representing an underlying reality behind all observed phenomena.The expert manipulation of these symbols results in changes in phenomena. Themagician is thus sensitive to the power and nature of symbols—including symbolicaction, symbolic sounds, smells, etc.—and can draw inferences across diverse culturesand times. Just as human biology is the same whether one is a native Tibetan orAfrican or European, etc.; and even though there may be many superficial differencesand variations in language, food, and so forth; the symbol systems of different culturesmay reveal superficial differences as a result of geography, history, and even religion,but the states of consciousness represented by these symbols are identical or nearly so.There would be no syncretic religions if this were not the case, for if each religion wassui generis it would be impossible to incorporate alien gods, rites, and beliefs. Ofcourse, this is not the case with religious dogma which fundamentally resists attemptsat syncretism; but it is the case with religious praxis, which is the only form of religionthat interests the magician. As noted previously, the magician is not a member of thecongregation of any religion: the magician is a priest and an independent spiritualspecialist whose interest solely resides in effective methods (rituals) and convenientmodes of analysis (symbol systems). Thus the emphasis on cults versus religions, for acult is a laboratory of ritual and dangerous practice. It may be a matter of opinion as towhether the ritual came before the dogma or vice versa; but it has been demonstratedin the case of religions as disparate as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saintsand Scientology that their origins are to be found in magical—that is to say, occult—ritual. The dogmas came later.Thus when we speak of the Yezidi religion we are struck by the fact that theemphasis seems to be on correct ritual practice rather than doctrine. There iscontroversy over whether or not the Yezidi have a written sacred text; their scriptureseems to reside in the chants, songs, and prayers that are memorized by the faithful andby their ritual specialists. There is also an emphasis on genetic purity: a Yezidi maynot marry outside the faith, and there is no possibility of an outsider converting toYezidism. This association of the body—the blood, the flesh—with religious purityand acceptability is an echo of the occult preoccupations of many different cultures"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"and religious affiliations. It is also a hallmark of cultic practice: the desire to cut off agroup from the outside world in order to maintain the group's physical, emotional andspiritual integrity is (among other things) a form of distrust of the “Other” but it is alsoa way to switch tables by making the mainstream group the “Other.”98In the case of the Yezidi, this is taken a step further when they identify themselveswith the supreme icon of the Other in the western world: the Fallen Angel, Shaitan.Their relationship to this form of the Dark Lord is complex. On the one hand, Shaitanis an emblem of bad luck that inspires fear. On the other hand, he is the Lord of theAngelic Hosts and is also known as the Lord of Power.99 This rather schizoid constructis so reminiscent of the way the Egyptians considered Set as to be virtually identical.To Grant, the peacock symbol is particularly important for he sees in the rainbow-hued spread of feathers a reference to the kalas: the spiritual essences secreted by thefemale partner in Tantric rituals. While it is possible that the Yezidis have their originin India—as has been claimed—there is no indication at the present time that anythingresembling sexual rituals or Tantra is known among them. Yet, the peacock itself is acurious emblem for a Kurdish clan in northern Iraq to worship for peacocks are notnative to that country while they are more common in India.The portals that lead to the inner chambers of Yezidi shrines are usually adornedwith carvings of snakes. The snake is shown as rising up from the ground and appearsas a vertical decoration on the right-hand side of the entrance. The appearance of asnake in this context further led observers to believe that there was something vaguelysatanic about the Yezidis, since the serpent is a symbol of evil and of the Devil inJudaeo-Christian religions. It was the serpent who tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden,leading to the fall of humanity from paradise. In Egypt, of course, it was identifiedwith Apophis, the evil creature intent on devouring the barque of Ra; but in Indianyoga and Tantra, the serpent represents the coiled energy at the base of the spineknown as Kundalini. The fact that the Yezidi serpent is depicted vertically alongsidethe entrance to the sacred shrine may be further—circumstantial—evidence of aconnection with Indian beliefs, as a vertical serpent would be an obvious reference tothe raising of Kundalini which is the goal of Kundalini yoga as it is of some forms ofTantra. However, there is no evidence for the existence of a “Yezidi Tantra.”One of Aleister Crowley's associates during his sojourn in the United States in 1919was the noted author and adventurer William Seabrook (1884-1945). Fascinated by theoccult and foreign locales, Seabrook had written a number of popular books andmagazine articles on his travels in Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean, and evenclaimed to have eaten human flesh on at least one occasion.100 Seabrook's works havebeen criticized by anthropologists who doubt his ability (or his desire) to separatereality from fantasy, but he stands at the crossroads of the topics that so fascinatedKenneth Grant: the Yezidis, witchcraft, and Vodun. In addition, as a friend of Crowley"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"he seems to be excellently positioned as a source for the beliefs and inspirationsbehind Grant's overall thesis.When it comes to the Yezidis, Seabrook claims that these “devil worshippers”maintain a network of seven towers across the Middle East, and Central and East Asia:Stretching across Asia, from North Manchuria, through Tibet, west throughPersia, and ending in the Kurdistan, was a chain of seven towers on isolatedmountaintops; and in each one of these towers sat continuously a Priest of Satan,who by “broadcasting” occult vibrations controlled the destinies of the world forevil.101There is no further evidence for this claim other than Seabrook's own statements,and it is possible that the towers one sees at Kalish and at other Yezidi shrines were theinspiration for this idea. Yezidi sacred architecture is unique: their shrines are in theshape of fluted cones surmounted by a golden ball that is said to represent the sun. Atthe base of the cone is an opening through which one can see a fire burning. The fire isan eternal flame, tended by the Yezidis, and is thus reminiscent of Zoroastrianpractice.If the Yezidi faith truly represents a survival of Persian Zoroastrianism, then there issome truth to Seabrook's statement that their “towers” extend through Asia, for theZoroastrians themselves have survived in India and Pakistan where they are known asParsis. Forced to flee Persia (Iran) rather than convert to Islam in the eighth and ninthcenturies CE, the Zoroastrian community found themselves in Pakistan (near Karachi)and in India in the Gujarat region in Mumbai, the former Bombay. There are severalfire temples in the Mumbai area where the Zoroastrians—now known as Parsis fromthe word for “Persian”—have become pillars of the Indian community, well-known fortheir charitable works. They also practice a form of “sky burial” known as the Towersof Silence.Because the elements are considered sacred, the Parsis leave their dead on top ofthese towers as food for vultures. To bury a corpse is considered a defilement of theearth, and to burn a corpse is considered a defilement of fire (which is a sacred symbolin Zoroastrianism). In Mumbai, these towers are located on Malabar Hill in what isnow an upscale neighborhood where they have become controversial due to the factthat the vulture population is declining and the presence of certain antibiotics in thedead bodies results in the corpses taking longer and longer to decay. It should be notedthat “sky burial” is also a feature of Tibetan religious and cultural practice, where thedead are left in the open air as food for carrion birds.It is possible that the unique tower architecture of the Yezidis was conflated with theTowers of Silence in Mumbai to give Seabrook the idea that there was a network ofYezidi towers stretching from Kurdistan to Tibet and Manchuria through Persia.Further, there are still Zoroastrians living in Iran, especially in the city of Yazd which"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"boasts a fire temple whose flame has been burning steadily since the fifth century CE.(The similarity in name between Yazd and the Yezidi has been noted by severalauthors, but there is no consensus of opinion as to where the name Yezid or Yezidioriginated or even what it actually means.) However, there is no evidence that there are“Priests of Satan” who sit atop these towers broadcasting “occult vibrations” for evilpurposes.There are, however, certain sites sacred to the Yezidis which have, for Grant, occultsignificance. Basing his information on Isya Joseph's The Devil Worshippers (butwithout attribution) he mentions five cult zones, one of which is Lalish (the center ofthe Yezidi religion already mentioned) and another which is called variously WeranŠahr or Goran Šahr:... meaning the ‘sunken city’, which recalls the sunken city of R'lyeh whereGreat Cthulhu waits dreaming.... We are now in a position to appreciateCrowley's claim to have continued, in and through Thelema, the major tenets ofthe Yezidic cult.102As mentioned previously, Crowley believed his supramundane contact and HolyGuardian Angel Aiwaz to have been a god of ancient Sumer.103 The Yezidis claim aSumerian ancestry for their people and their religion and, indeed, reverence a form ofShaitan or Set. Further, the official seal of the Yezidi clan depicts not only the peacockof Melek Ta'us,104 but also cuneiform inscriptions plus the ancient Sumeriancuneiform symbol for “god,” the eight-pointed star,105 thus showing their insistence onan ancient Mesopotamian origin for their faith. All of this data is consistent with whatGrant calls the “Necronomicon gnosis.”The only lengthy examination of the Yezidis in Grant's works appears as a singlechapter in Outer Gateways: “The Magical Significance of Yezidic Symbolism.” In thatchapter, Grant associates the Yezidis with a number of other religions, cults, myths,practices, etc. with a heavy reliance upon coincidences in numerology, similar-sounding words, etc., all with a view towards demonstrating that the Yezidis are theinheritors of an ancient magical Typhonian current that erupted in the system ofThelema as preached by Crowley. Crowley himself implies as much, of course, butGrant attempts to “prove” this connection and elaborate upon it. The problem with hisapproach is that it is based almost entirely on the few scraps of information availableon the Yezidis in a handful of outdated and unreliable sources (such as Seabrook),which are then tied into the grand design using the most tenuous of associations. Thus,for Grant, the peacock is a phallic symbol because the eyes on the peacock's feathersrepresent the “meatus of the phallus, which is why the cock was typical of Yezid”106and:The eyes in the tail of the peacock, or the meatus in the phallus of Yezid are"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"equally connoted, and are resumed in the glyph of the Eye in the Triangle whichforms part of the emblem of the O.T.O. Kaph signifies both the palm (of thehand), and the kaf ape, which typified among other things the open eye or theexposed meatus of the circumcised penis in a state of erection, thus denoting theever wakeful one.107One is tempted to say that sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. However, we begin torealize that virtually everything in the cosmos can be interpreted sexually, or usingsexual metaphor, and that this is a hallmark of the “twilight language” used byoccultists, alchemists, and mystics as a kind of meta-language for discussing otherwiseineffable—or “unspeakable”—concepts. There is only one process in the universe, andevery science, every art, every religion, every field of occult knowledge can bediscussed and investigated using the language of that process. Thus, using sexualmetaphor, one can describe ecstatic mystical states as well as the transmutation of leadinto gold.Crowley himself makes this point when he writes:I have myself constructed numerous ceremonies where it is frankly admittedthat religious enthusiasm is primarily sexual in character.... I have insisted thatsexual excitement is merely a degraded form of divine ecstasy.108This divine ecstasy is still only a means towards an end. Ecstasy can be chemicallyinduced, or brought about by various other means, none of which would necessarilyresult in spiritual illumination, acquisition of occult powers, etc. Intensive meditation,of the type enjoyed by anchorites and hermits of various disciplines, also results indivine ecstasy, minus the overtly sexual components. The magical path represented byCrowley and by his mentors in the Golden Dawn, however, sees emotional andpsychological states as reflective of spiritual qualities that may or may not beperceived as good or evil in and of themselves: these states are only levels ofunderstanding, of types of experience that do not carry moral loads but areinformational. They are interpreted within a specific cultural context such as theKabbalistic Tree of Life or any other complete cosmological system that makes aspace for all forms of human experience, including the divine and the demonic. Inorder for Crowley's system to be the complete cosmology that any magical practicedemands, it must make room for what Western spiritual experience would considerdemonic, satanic, etc. There are, after all, two “Keys of Solomon” in the repetoire ofthe Golden Dawn: the Greater Key, which is concerned with angelic and planetarymagic, and the Lesser Key, or Goetia, which is wholly involved with the raising ofdemons. Both are necessary. And it is the peculiar characteristic of sexuality that it canbe a “Greater Key,” an expression of love, respect, fidelity, a means of reproductionand the survival of the species, a symbol of union with the divine ... and a “LesserKey,” an avenue for the manifestation of the darkest desires of a human being, of"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"sadism, masochism, and all the demons of a Krafft-Ebing grimoire:Sexual feeling is really the root of all ethics, and no doubt of aestheticism andreligion.The sublimest virtues, even the sacrifice of self, may spring from sexual life,which, however, on account of its sensual power, may easily degenerate into thelowest passion and basest vice.Love unbridled is a volcano that burns down and lays waste all around it; it isan abyss that devours all honour, substance and health.109Thus at its core sexuality is as pure as atomic energy: it can be used for peacefulpurposes, or for creating weapons. The irony lies in the fact that it may sometimes benecessary to have an atomic bomb, i.e., that for the species to survive a means ofprotection is often required. This is the basis of Tantra, which sees sexuality as ametaphor, as the creative process, as a means of uniting with the divine, and as ameans of acquiring occult powers. It is also as good a description as any of the doublenature of Set in the Egyptian context, and why Set is associated with sexual ritual andmagic by Grant.While many of the rituals of the Yezidi are largely secret to which outsiders arerarely, if ever, invited there is still no evidence that they engage in sexual ceremoniesor elaborate, Tantric-style magical procedures. They may satisfy the requirements ofCrowley and Grant that they represent a connection with ancient Sumer and with theworship of the Old God, Shaitan or Set, and while such may be romanticizedprojections by orientalist observers what is to be respected is that they have notabandoned their faith, even under dire oppression by a host of hostile entities. Theymaintain their ritual purity, their sacred calendar, their beliefs, and their rites in theface of Iraqi, Russian, Muslim and even Kurdish opposition. They refuse to intermarry,or to accept outsiders into their religion, a religion that is identified not only with theirbeliefs but with their ethnicity as well. It is the mere fact of their existence that hasintrigued and excited European and American occultists, for here is a clan whosereligion is so far removed from anything else in the region as to appear bizarre tooutsiders and who claim an origin in the vanished civilization of Sumer ... and whoworship a god that some insist is the Dark Lord himself."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Obeah and WangaOn November 1st, 1907, there had come to the New Orleans police a franticsummons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters there,mostly primitive but good-natured descendants of Lafitte's men, were in the gripof stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night.It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had everknown. ... There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling chantsand dancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messenger added, the peoplecould stand it no more.—H.P. Lovecraft, “The Call of Cthulhu”Also the mantras and spells; the obeah and the wanga; the work of the wand andthe work of the sword; these he shall learn and teach. (AL I:37).When we discuss the Yezidis, we are faced with very little accurate and reliableinformation and a lot of speculation. When we come to the Afro-Caribbean aspect ofthe Necronomicon Gnosis, we are in a somewhat different position.While Haitian Vodun (commonly spelled “voodoo”) was just as vulnerable ahundred years ago to wild speculation and hysteria as the “devil worshipping” Yezidis,we have a greater store of solid information and documentation about Vodun and otherAfro-Caribbean religions due to the intense interest shown by anthropologists andhistorians of religion in recent years. In addition, the presence of African-originpopulations in the Caribbean and large communities of Afro-Caribbean origin in theUnited States has made Western access to these cultures easier than it is where theYezidi clans are concerned, since the homelands and central shrines of the latter arescattered largely through the Middle East and Central Asia in war zones and areashostile to outsiders.Vodun, Santeria, Palo Mayombe, and Lukumi share some elements in common withthe Yezidis. They do not have a written scripture, per se. They frequently have beenconfused with devil worship. And they represent a survival of ancient forms ofreligious experience, in this case from Africa: a continent that they share with Egypt.They have also been exploited to some extent by non-African occultists who see intheir rituals methodologies of magical practice and the acquisition of altered states ofconsciousness that lead to greater spiritual power and abilities, especially when re-interpreted within European and American (i.e., non-African) contexts. Probably thepremier exponent of this type of synthesis is Michael Bertiaux, an important source forGrant.Bertiaux came to the attention of the broader occult community in the United Statesthrough his massive, 600+ page Voudon Gnostic Workbook (New York: MagickalChilde, 1998), but prior to the book's publication he was already a subject of Grant's"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Typhonian Trilogies. The first mention of Bertiaux and his unique form of Thelemic-Gnostic-Vodun appears in two chapters of Grant's Cults of the Shadow (1975) whichexplain Bertiaux's system in terms that are both Thelemic and Lovecraftian. Indeed,Bertiaux deliberately uses terminology and ideas from Lovecraft in his occult work, aswell as terms and concepts that are uniquely his own. But Grant's initial fascinationwith Bertiaux's work seems to be the fact that both he and Bertiaux explored the“nightside” of the Tree of Life, the realm of the Dark Lord. In Bertiaux's case, heconnected the Dark Side of the Tree with some of the Vodun cults and practices thatwould be considered “black magic” in contemporary parlance. This, coupled with theCrowley and Lovecraft references in Bertiaux, ignited a stream of consciousness inGrant that would heavily influence his later work. Bertiaux acknowledged theimportance of sexual ritual, including Tantra, and associated it with various types ofAfro-Caribbean practice, and all within a Thelemic context. This was the Obeah andthe Wanga, the missing elements from the Thelemic arsenal of occult methods andsystems.Obeah is a form of Afro-Caribbean magic, what is sometimes called “hoodoo” in theSouth. The practice as it is known today has its origins in Jamaica and consists mostlyof casting spells as opposed to the more religious aspects of Haitian Vodun. There isevidence that the term comes from an Ashanti word—obayifo—meaning “witch” or“wizard” or even “vampire.”110 Thus it has a negative connotation. Wanga (sometimesspelled ouanga) on the other hand refers specifically to a small bag used to holdcharms, sometimes worn around the neck or kept in a safe place, similar to the NativeAmerican “medicine bag” except that the latter is usually worn or carried by themedicine man only, whereas the wanga may be prepared for anyone to wear andusually for a specific purpose, such as love, money, health, etc. and dedicated to aspecific loa (lwa): one of the Afro-Caribbean gods. However, both obeah and wangaare sometimes used as terms denoting Afro-Caribbean occultism in general. Wanga issometimes thought to refer specifically to works of “black” or negative magic.111What, then, is the meaning or intent behind the exhortation in the Book of the Lawthat one should “learn and teach” the “obeah and the wanga”? Why did Aiwaz usethese terms and avoid using, for instance, “Voodoo and Santeria”?The two latter are religions which have internally-consistent cosmologies,pantheons, and rituals. Obeah and wanga are somewhat looser in their definitions, butmore importantly, do not refer to religious dogmas per se but to the practical side ofreligion, that is, magic. Obeah and wanga are occult methods used by Afro-Caribbeanspiritual specialists and this is what would have been important to the author of theBook of the Law. After all, the infamous Chapter Three makes it clear that all previousreligions are “black.”However, as we have seen, the consensus of opinion seems to be that both obeah andwanga are “black arts” themselves. That is, they are concerned with what Kabbalists"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"would consider the darker, or nightside, aspect of the Tree of Life and may beassociated with the qlippoth: the shattered shards of creation that are tantamount todemons. And the connective tissue to all of this is the focus of both Grant and Bertiauxon the sexual aspect of these dark mysteries. This is an obvious direction for occultistswho represent the most transgressive of their breed, for the “white” magician is usuallythought of as being—if not celibate, then—more chaste than the average person,devoting his or her time and energy to good works, speaking with angels, and yearningfor union with the divine: leading a life that would be considered conventionally moraland blameless. There is no mixing of the sexes in this type of occultism, or if there is itis within the religiously sanctioned confines of matrimony.One only has to remember that the congregations in synagogues and mosques areseparated by gender; that even Vedic practice in India keeps the sexes apart as much aspossible. Christianity can be seen as an exception to this rule, and it is worthwhile toremember that the earliest Christian rituals known to the outside world took the formof the agape, or love-feast. These gender-mixed congregations would meet in secret(often in catacombs or cemeteries) due to their persecution by the state and by otherreligious authorities. Thus, Christianity could be considered the Satanism of its day.When the genders are brought together in magical rituals, there is always thepossibility that a sexual current will run through the group particularly in theheightened (almost romantic) atmosphere of a ceremony that is conducted secretly, incandle-light, with billowing clouds of perfumes and incenses, specially-designed robesin appropriate colors and materials, and so forth. One form of transgression—occultritual—implies every other form, including the sexual; in addition, the appropriationof spiritual power away or apart from normative, socially-sanctioned priesthoods canbe intoxicating.In the rites of Haitian Vodun, the above conditions are exceeded through the use of abattery of drums and at times other musical instruments. In these rituals the focus is onthe human body as the “horse” to be ridden by the gods in a form of divine possession.At such times, the individual person is no longer “present” as an ego or superego in hisor her own physical form but has been momentarily dislodged by one of the lwa. Thepossessed person's body undergoes a subtle—or sometimes not so subtle—transformation as the personality of Erzulie (the goddess of love and passion) orperhaps of Baron Samedi de la Cimitiere (the god who controls access to theUnderworld) or any of the many other gods who take over and cause the possessedperson to walk and act in accordance with the characteristics of the particular lwa.Oddly, these things are not discussed in the Voudon Gnostic Workbook of MichaelBertiaux. While it does treat of the many varieties of Haitian lwa it does not focus onthe rites most commonly associated with Haitian Vodun, such as the rituals that takeplace in the peristyle and hounfort. Instead, Bertiaux treats the Haitian material theway that Crowley treats the Egyptian: as data to be incorporated into rituals and"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"spiritual methodologies more familiar to Western European occult practice. In the caseof Bertiaux and his Gnostic Vodun, it is a syncretism of a syncretism.From a post-modernist perspective, of course, this is hideous: an outrage against theoriginal material, an exploitation of an indigenous culture's spirituality. But that is trueof all magic. Magic is, by its very nature, a method and not a faith or a dogma. Itspractices transcend the cultural because they are concerned with altered states ofconsciousness and not with adherence to a particular Law or Tradition. This is how itwas possible for Jewish mystics such as Shabbtai Z'vi or a Jakob Frank to “convert” toIslam and Christianity, respectively, and still maintain their following and theirreputation as advanced adepts. This is how it was possible for an Aleister Crowley toincorporate yoga and quasi-Tantric practices into his Thelema even though he was anEnglishman who had received the Book of the Law in Cairo replete with Egyptian godsdoing all the talking. In this context, the creative approach to spirituality of a MichaelBertiaux is entirely consistent. There is virtually no form of occultism in the westernworld that does not incorporate elements of “other” religions and “other” occultpractices. The very liminality of occultism implies that “otherness” will be a constant,determining factor in its construction.While Bertiaux includes material from diverse sources to amplify his version of“voodoo,” he is not alone in examining this Afro-Caribbean system through the lens ofother cultures and religions. While a purist may insist on a strict “African”interpretation of Vodun—denying any syncretism involving other religions (such asRoman Catholicism) or other mystical or magical systems—twentieth-century Haitianwriters on the subject frequently invoke Greek, Egyptian and even Jewish terms andconcepts as a means of expanding upon the rituals and the legends that inform it. Thisapproach is condemned by post-modern anthropologists and academics as inherentlycolonialist and racist: the projection of white, western insecurities about race,sexuality, and religion onto a captive, “savage” population. The fact that some nativeHaitian authors on the subject contribute to this approach does not make thecontroversy any clearer.An early author who is sometimes cited in the literature is Arthur C. Holly. Writingin French under the pseudonym Her-Ra-Ma-El, his books are a melange of Biblicalreferences, Christian concepts, Afro-centrism, and a minimum of actual informationon Vodun. His Les daïmons du culte voudo112 is the most-referenced, but usuallyderisively. However, in a line often quoted, he does insist on a connection betweenHaitian Vodun and ancient Egyptian and Assyrian religion:C'est en vain que les procédés hypocrites ou violents ont été mis en oeuvre pourenvelopper des ténèbres les phases brillants de l'évolution mentale du Nègre. Ilest hors de conteste que l'antique civilisation Ethiopio-égypto-assyrienne doitêtre inscrite à son compte.113"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"(“It is in vain that hypocritical or violent processes have been used to shroud indarkness the brilliance of the mental evolution of the Negro. It is beyond doubtthat the ancient Ethiopian-Egyptian-Assyrian civilizaton must be credited to hisaccount.”)andIl nous parait indiscutable que la tradition Voudo descend en ligne directe: dusacerdoce et des rites usités dans les temples d'Ethiopie et d'Egypte.114(“It seems to us undeniable that the Voudo tradition descends in direct line fromthe priesthood and the rites used in the temples of Ethiopia and Egypt.”)Holly called himself a “Haitian esotericist”115 and this is borne out by his lengthyand sometimes incomprehensible study of Vodun through the lens of a kind ofKabbalah in which each letter of the Latin alphabet possesses mystical meanings, sothat an analysis of any word (including the names of Vodun lwa) can yield a warehousefull of secondary and tertiary meanings. His emphasis is on this system rather than onVodun itself, rendering his book of interest only to those studying early twentieth-century Haitian Francophone occult philosophy.Indeed, Holly references all the usual suspects: Court de Gébelin, Fabre d'Olivet,Eduard Schuré, and Eliphas Levi (the Abbé Louis Constant) are all cited in this work,placing it firmly in the lineage of French esotericism, Theosophy, Freemasonry, andmagic. This is especially the case with Levi, of whom Crowley believed himself to bethe reincarnation. Except, in Holly's view, Africa and Vodun were the source for allEuropean esotericism, including Freemasonry:Sur ce point je n'ai personnellement aucun doute. Car DAm-Bha-Lah, la MèreDivine, la Négresse universelle, le COEUR QUI VIVIFIE l'humanité, est seulecapable de réaliser la parfaite solidarité, basée sur l'Amour, entre Noirs etJaunes.

En effet, le Salut de la Patrie dépend plutôt de la Franc-maçonnerieque l'Eglise. Et le Voudo, c'est la Mère de la Franc-maçonnerie comme on vientde le l'entrevoir dans les pages précédentes.116(On this point I personally have no doubt.

Indeed, the Health of the Country dependsrather on Freemasonry than the Church. And Voudo is the Mother ofFreemasonry as we have just had a glimpse in the preceding pages.)Here Holly shows us that he has an esoteric interpretation of the names of the godsof Vodun, dividing Dambhala into separate syllables, each of which has its ownmeaning and relevance. This is something that Grant himself does, to similar effect, asin the following word analysis from his Ninth Arch, the last in the Typhonian Trilogiesseries:Frater Achad interpreted the thirteen-lettered word MANIFESTATION asconcentrating the magical formula of the Aeon of Maat whose ‘lesser cycle’ wasto manifest through her daughter, Mâ. This is correct so far as it goes, but thereis more to it. The daughter typifies the Pythoness of Maat as the unawakened(i.e. virgin) priestess in her magnetic and oracular sleep. The essential formulamay be schematized thus:Mâ = entranced medium, ‘lesser cycle’ (of the sixteen kalas)ni = Amen, the Hidden God—the Sun behind the sun (Set-Isis/Sothis).festat = Cairo, the locus of the Double Current: Aiwass/Nu-Isision = Aeon; the ‘Greater Cycle' wherein the seventeenth kala is secreted(i.e., the ultimate and Secret-ion).117We will note that in both cases there are references to the Sun, and the Pythoness ofMaat may have something in common with Holly's Dambhala. While Dambhalanormally is considered to be a male deity, his symbol is also the snake. In Holly'sparagraph above-cited, however, Dambhala is female since Holly focuses on the firstsyllable of the word, Dam, and sees in it a reference to the French word for woman,Dame. So Dambhala becomes, for him, the Divine Mother and Universal Negress, aswell as the fons et origo of Freemasonry.While Holly is perhaps an unusual and suspect source for information on Vodun, wehave a more professional expert in Milo Rigaud. Rigaud—born Emile Rigaud—wrote anumber of books on Vodun, heavily illustrated with photographs of ceremonies anddiagrams of the vévés: the arcane symbols that attract the lwa to the rituals. While hisbooks are comprehensive treatments of his subject, he also falls victim to the type ofgrand theories that obsessed Holly. He links the practice of Vodun to Egypt and toSolomon's Temple, among other places, and he quotes Holly approvingly in thisinstance, implying that he agrees with the Egyptian-Ethiopian-Assyrian roots of Vodun"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"and their contribution to western, European esotericism and Freemasonry.118Both Holly and Rigaud are Haitian authors, men who knew their country and itsreligious culture as well as anyone, but who wrote about it from a Francophone pointof view. Creole is the language of the people in Haiti, and French is the language of thegovernment and the intellectual elite. An educated Haitian, interested in religion andspirituality, first would seek for information in French which inevitably would lead tothe fields of Martinism, Freemasonry, the various Gnostic churches, and authors likeEliphas Levi and Papus (Dr. Encausse) and many others, all of whom did, indeed, exertan influence over European and American occultism both through their books andthrough the organizations and secret societies they joined or founded. Holly andRigaud would have found in these sources confirmation of what they already believedto be true: that their religious culture was part of a continuum of spiritual experiencethat began in Africa—everywhere in Africa, including Egypt, the Sudan, and Ethiopia—and thus had tendrils extending as far as the salons of Paris and the secret societiesof London, Germany, and elsewhere on the continent.It's the perceived racist attitude towards Vodun that irritates anthropologists,however. They will insist that Vodun is a religion, and while they do not deny themagical aspects of the religion they will condemn any attempt to see in Vodunanything smacking of the titillating or suggestive. The approach of Bertiaux is attackedby experts who claim that he represents a colonialist and racist stereotyping of Vodunof the type we find in Lovecraft, for instance. By associating Vodun with sexual ritualsand contact with supra-mundane entities—what many average observers would call“black magic” in a purely pejorative way (and perhaps as a thinly-veiled racistallusion)—Bertiaux is seen to be contributing to the Hollywood concept of Vodun as“voodoo” with all the weird rites and licentiousness that the term suggests.There are problems with this analysis, however. It has become fashionable to assertthat any interest in indigenous religions by white observers, be they academics andscholars or journalists and authors of popular books on the subject, is suspect. EdwardSaid implied as much in his ground-breaking book, Orientalism,119 when he castigatedwestern, European attempts at describing Asia as rooted in colonialist and racistattitudes towards Asians, attitudes that were composed of equal parts of fear, disgustand desire. While Said's thesis has been criticized recently,120 it is still a difficulthurdle for non-indigenous observers to overcome for it is assumed that they are, ipsofacto, tainted by the same vulnerabilities. This is even more pronounced among thosewho go overboard in attacking other non-indigenous observers whom they believe tobe inappropriately reverent when it comes to religions like Vodun, for they can beaccused of manifesting “white guilt” or some similar desire to be absolved of theirrace's historical crimes against non-white populations. It is truly a no-win situation,but usually is apparent in academic circles where the near-impossibility of stayingabove the fray is pronounced. Among occultists there are no such anxieties. In the"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"quest for greater and greater occult power all avenues are fair game, and sinceoccultism can be viewed (by some) as largely psychological and emotional, the racialand sexual stereotypes of any “cult” can be mined for their connections to deeperpsychological complexes in the operator.Yet there is another problem for the mainstream apologists for Vodun, and that isthat there are secret societies in Haiti that are responsible for some of the bad pressthat “voodoo” gets, and which gave us the infamous “zombie powder” among otherthings. These societies specialize in those elements of Vodun that could be consideredmagic as differentiated from religion. Wade Davis has written two books121 on thesubject of these societies which were the basis of his ethnobiological fieldwork in Haitiduring which time he was actually initiated into one of these groups. The vigorousattempts by some anthropologists to downplay the more sinister aspects of the Haitianreligious experience fall apart in the face of this type of scholarship. Of course, a casecould be made that the Haitian secret societies—such as Bizango, Zobop, the SecteRouge, etc.—bear as much relationship to traditional Vodun as the Church of Satandoes to the Roman Catholic Church ... but Davis demonstrates that there exists a muchcloser bond between the secret societies and normative Vodun than one would suppose,and that these secret societies perform much the same function as the “Illuminati” or“Freemasons” are alleged to do in European countries: they are the real “masters” ofthe country, operating behind the scenes and meting out punishment where necessaryto maintain order in the Haitian communities.122Therefore, for our purposes we can acknowledge that what anthropologists call“Vodoun” or “Vodun,” etc. represents an assembly of various African religions underone convenient (albeit misleading) umbrella and that as a religion it deserves the samerespect as any other; but we must also acknowledge that such things as curses, bloodsacrifice, and even zombification also exist as part of the Haitian religious/occultexperience just as antinomian secret societies and “satanic” occult groups exist withinthe normative white European Christian or Jewish religious experience. And it iswithin the context of the Haitian secret societies, such as the Bizango, that we find thegreatest correlation with the ideas discussed by Bertiaux and Grant.The element of Bertiaux's unique cosmology that interests Grant is the idea thatthere are points chauds or “hot points” (or “power points”) in the universe that act asportals into other realms of experience, as “gates” to the “underworld.” The adepts whoare capable of entering these points at will are sometimes referred to as voltigeurs (or“leapers”) in the Bertiaux vernacular. These power points are located on the humanbody as well as at specific areas of the earth and in the cosmos, in perfectmicrocosm/macrocosm symmetry. It follows that if these points can be locatedsimultaneously in the body as well as in the heavens (for instance) then physicalmanipulation or stimulation of those points is equivalent to opening the celestial gates,and a Tantric-type process can be pursued that uses the body and its hidden resources"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"as a vehicle for celestial (and infernal) exploration. An essential characteristic ofTantra is the understanding that psycho-biological processes take place which alterconsciousness. In rare instances, these processes may take place accidentally—throughsome form of physical or emotional trauma—but more often they are the result ofcareful practice and deliberate application of occult methods such as yoga, meditation,pranayama, and other means of interfering with the normal functions of the humanbody. If the body is a laboratory and a temple combined, then changing any of thebody's processes such as control of breathing, of heartbeat, contorting the limbs intouncomfortable positions for long periods of time, or even taking drugs that alter eitherthe physical or the mental activities of the operator will produce a variety of resultsthat are outside the normal range of human experience.The occultist uses the tools that are available to seek control over the body'sautonomic nervous system—the system that regulates such things as breathing, heartrate, peristalsis, etc.—as well as control over the mind's “autonomic” functions,processes that can be located in what the Freudians call the unconscious mind. This isall quite different from the way of the mystic in prayer who wants to unite with thedivine through piety and good works. It is a mechanistic approach to consciousness anddivinity that horrifies churchmen and the pious, offending them as much as do frankdiscussions of sexuality. The pious speak of love and marriage; sex is either notmentioned or is couched in euphemism. The magician speaks of everything in terms ofthe use to be made of it, its pragmatic application to the desired goal.This is what one finds in Bertiaux as well as in Grant. It should be noted that Grant'sinformation concerning Vodun is purely of the Bertiaux variety. There is no attempt tooffer an academic presentation of the material, no citations of scholarly works onAfro-Caribbean religion juxtaposed with citations from the Voudon Gnostic Workbookjust as there are no discussions of Roman Catholic doctrines or excerpts from theLutheran prayer book. There is no devotional literature in magic. The interest ofBertiaux, Grant and Crowley is on spiritual techniques and esoteric technology. Thecultural contexts of Vodun, Egyptian religion, to a lesser extent the Tantras, and eventhe Yezidis are ignored or at least unacknowledged in favor of the deconstruction oftheir respective technologies—the way a gear-head takes apart an automobile engine tosee how it is put together. These techniques give rise—mostly through ritual—tootherworldly experiences that they then attempt to describe and analyze for a wideraudience, with wildly uneven results. Grant's presentation of the already complicatedand sometimes hyperbolic Bertiaux material verges on the incomprehensible, and Icontend that it is not meant to be read as linear prose but as a kind of free-association:language reduced (or elevated) to mantra and chant.Bertiaux, like Grant, is obsessed with the dark side of esotericism. TraditionalKabbalah, alchemy, Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism are all ignored in favor of the moresinister aspects of the spiritual experience, and ways are sought to contact entities that"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"are believed to exist in other dimensions, entities that are nevertheless understood tobe capable of interacting with our own. These are alien beings in every sense of theterm: they are not beautiful in any conventional sense: no angels with harps, no long-bearded prophets. These are the monstrous shapes imagined by Lovecraft and otherhorror writers of his generation; except that for Bertiaux and Grant they are notfigments of imagination and thus “not real,” but have an independent existence of theirown. In the Bertiaux and Grant cosmology, Lovecraft did not invent these creatures: hesaw them in his dreams, which are a time-honored method of communicating with theunconscious mind (in a modern sense) or with the spirit world (in a more ancientcontext). The gods of Vodun may have begun the same way as Great Cthulhu andNyarlathotep; and the methods of contacting the one may be used to contact the other,and with similar—even measureable—results. What began in a dream may becontacted in a dream, or at least in a trance. The altered states so representative ofspirit possession in Haiti—and recognized as such by Lovecraft in “The Call ofCthulhu”—are a way of re-dreaming the original dream, of going “back to Guinee”: toan African homeland that exists nowhere on earth, yet everywhere on earth. The pointschauds are elements of an occult Matrix, places where one strand of the spider's webcrosses another. Taken together, they form a membrane over the cranium of themagical operator like the touch screen on a computer monitor. It is where Bertiaux's“voodoo” meets Grant's Tantra that the intellectual and conceptual explosion takesplace that leads the Typhonian Order into the realm of the Dark Lord."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"In Pursuit of GoldIt was most likely observing the meetings of David Curwen and Aleister Crowley thatprovided Kenneth Grant with the impetus he needed to realize that Indian Tantra heldthe key to the mysteries of the OTO as well as to all of western occultism itself. WhileGrant usually quotes discredited texts on the Yezidis and on Vodun, in the realm ofIndian religion and magic he is on somewhat surer ground even as he makes at timesreckless use of the texts. For many western occultists, drawn to magic through theworks of Crowley or of the other magicians who came out of the Golden Dawnenvironment, Grant's books were the first that introduced them to Tantra and to thepotentiality of this rather messy yet strikingly powerful tradition: “messy” in the sensethat no one can agree on what Tantra is; powerful because it deals with magicalprocesses in remarkably clear language.Of all the unspeakable cults in Grant's repetoire, Tantra is where his erudition(although subject to serious criticism by actual Tantrikas) and his grasp of theterminology shines through. Grant is a knowledgeable non-initiate when it comes toTantra, but it must be said that he makes mistakes in nomenclature, definitions, etc.which may be due more to the lack of access to published materials (and his own lackof initiation into a Tantric circle) than to any desire to confuse or bloviate. The valuein Grant's description of Tantric rites and concepts lies in the fact that it is the firsttime for many western occultists that they have been exposed to this material andserves as an inducement to conduct their own, independent research. Further, whileTantrikas may object to Grant's cavalier use of Tantric terms and concepts to furtherhis own investigations of the Dark Lord, it is entirely consistent with Bertiaux'sapproach to Vodun and Crowley's approach to Egyptology and Yezidism. That is not toabsolve these magicians from a responsibility to be accurate insofar as possible, but itdoes demonstrate the essential bricolage tendency of western occultists who strive toreach beyond a Judeao-Christian framework and into other, foreign realms. This is thelure of Babalon, of course: the ultimate “foreigner” and seducer of spiritual aspirantssince time immemorial.David Curwen (1893-1984) was an intimate of Aleister Crowley in the period 1944-1947, until the latter's death in December of that year, and they maintained a deepcorrespondence on magic, alchemy and especially Tantra. Curwen recently (2006) was“outed” as the author of the very influential alchemical work In Pursuit of Gold (1976)written under the pseudonym Lapidus (Latin for “Stone”). In Pursuit of Gold wassubtitled “Alchemy Today in Theory and Practice” which seems to echo Crowley's ownMagick in Theory and Practice and to a certain extent these two volumes complementeach other as modern takes on these ancient arts.The relationship between Curwen and Crowley was not always fraternal. Crowleysoon began to realize that Curwen—who had studied Tantra in India—was more"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"knowledgeable than he when it came to Indian forms of occultism and, of course, inparticular Tantra. Crowley's exposure to Tantra was limited to a few Englishtranslations of a handful of Tantric texts, whereas Curwen's experience was muchdeeper and more profound. When both Curwen and Crowley began to realize Crowley'slimitation in that regard, the friendship suffered a little. Crowley had to be the smartestman in the room, at least where occultism was concerned, and Curwen was living proofthat there were other mysteries, other revelations to which Crowley had had noprevious access.At the same time, a friendship developed between Kenneth Grant and DavidCurwen, to the extent that Curwen encouraged Grant to explore Tantra more deeply.This would set Grant on the path for which he would become most famous: theexploration of Thelema and the core secret of the OTO as delineated in the texts andpractices of the Tantric adepts of India.The subject of Tantra is vast, and I have introduced the subject elsewhere,123 but forthe purposes of this investigation we will focus on the type of Tantric groups that areof interest to Grant, the “unspeakable cults” of India.The first such group is the Sri Vidya sect.r Vidy (“Holy Knowledge”) can actually be broken down into four separate, butlinked, manifestations. Basically, it is form of Goddess worship that has as its goaladvaita, or non-duality. Therefore it is a Shakta tradition (as differentiated from aShaivite tradition) in which the source of power, of shakti, is imagined in the Goddess.The particular goddess in the case of Sri Vidya is known as Lalit Tripurasundar.Tripura Sundari means “Beautiful Goddess of the Three Cities,” the three cities in thiscase referring to three different aspects of the goddess as physical, subtle, andsupreme. She is usually depicted as a sixteen-year-old girl, and for that reason issometimes called oa or “Sixteen” and Lalitã or “she who plays.” It should be notedthat the number sixteen figures prominently in Grant's number system as thedesignation for the sixteenth kala, the ultimate of the kalas or secretions of thepriestess. Her mantra also contains sixteen letters.The foremost symbol of the Sri Vidya sect is the Sri Meru Cakra, which is a three-dimensional version of the Sri Yantra, usually made of special metals in a sacred alloythat allows the blessings of the Goddess to flow more powerfully. The Sri Yantra is atwo-dimensional magical drawing of nine interlocking triangles that represents theunity of male and female—Shiva and Shakti—forces and could thus be seen as adepiction of the essential philosophy of both Tantra and Thelema.The form of worship known as Samayachara takes place in the mind, as even therituals—puja—themselves can be performed mentally if the appropriate ritual objectsare not to hand. In this case the Goddess is visualized and the entire ritual is muchmore personal and interiorized."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"In increasing complexity, we then arrive at the form of Sri Vidya known asDakshinachara in which an external form of the Goddess is required: either an idol orthe Sri Meru Cakra ... or even a female devotee. It should be noted that in this practicethere is no intimate contact between the worshipper and the woman—the suvasini—who represents the Goddess although she is a focus for the ritual.The Kaulachara is the one that gets most of the attention, for the external object ofdevotion is a living woman or a man, or a male and female couple. The famous ritualof the “Five M's”—the panchamakara—is part of the Kaulachara repetoire, althoughnot practiced as often or as widely as believed. Since the goal of Sri Vidya isessentially advaita and the negation of all duality, the rituals themselves emphasizethat there is no difference between the worshipper and the worshipped: that, in effect,everyone and everything is the Goddess. Eventually all sense of self—self as a separateentity, apart from the rest of the cosmos—disappears. The use of nudity and sexualityin these rituals, which can be as physical or as virtual as the leader determines, isdesigned to remove all sense of “otherness” by conquering shame, fear, and carnaldesire.The final, and most controversial, form of Sri Vidya is the Vamachara practice. Thedevotees of Vamachara are the groups that meet in cemeteries and crematory grounds,and which see the Goddess in her terrible and frightening aspect. The idea is totranscend even the grossest, most loathesome aspects of creation, of humanity, ofreality. To see the Goddess in the corpses of the cremation ground, to smell Herperfume in the stench of burning flesh, and to hear Her voice in the hideous sounds ofan Indian cemetery in the night is the height of spiritual piety. And when theVamachara circle goes to the extent—as some of them do—to perform panchatattva orpanchamakara (the ritual of the Five M's that includes maithuna or sexual contact) inthe intimate, overwhelming presence of corpses is to conquer death and to bring all ofcreation back to a single point: death and the act of conception taking place in the samelocation, decay and desire obliterating the boundary between this world and the next.It is no wonder then that Grant would have been fascinated by these practices. Hewould have seen—as glimpsed through a scrim, at an angle, in shadow—the secrets ofthe Gnostic Mass and the Star Sapphire ritual exposed and expanded through theintense ceremonies of the Kaulachara and Vamachara sects. The Tantric texts andrituals would have revealed to Grant the secrets behind the secrets. Shiva and Shakti onthrones in the center of the Kaula circle are analogues of Chaos and Babalon, of whatJung perhaps would call the Shadow and the Anima, and the consumption of the fluidsin the Gnostic Mass and the Star Sapphire rituals are perfectly comprehensible withinthe context of the Sri Vidya tradition. In fact, the reasons behind the secrets of theOTO's VIIIth and IXth degrees would be explained and amplified through consultingthe Tantric texts, not only of the Sri Vidya sect but also of a number of other groupsfrom the Kashmiri Shaivites to the Nath Siddhis and, of course, of the Tibetan Tantric"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"tradition with its famous Kalachakra Tantra and the associated scheme of initiations.Grant would focus on two aspects of the Tantras that he felt were crucial to anunderstanding of Thelema. The first was the idea of non-duality and the destruction ofthe ego. This also concerned Crowley, of course, as we have mentioned above, in hispursuit of samdhi or the state of actually experiencing non-duality through theidentification of subject with object during meditation. Crowley, who was familiarwith the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (an English translation of which had appeared in1914), knew that samadhi was the highest possible state of consciousness that could beachieved while still alive, the only possible higher state being that of the mahasamdhior “great samadhi” that occurs at the time of death.The second was the concept of the kla.The best blood is of the moon, monthly ... (AL III:24)Grant would have been the first western occultist to write openly about this subject,at least the first to enjoy a wide audience among those interested in ceremonial magicand the western occult tradition. The kalas are explained as vaginal secretions, notlimited to menstrual blood, which occur during the entire menstrual cycle and whichhave different occult properties depending on the day they occur. These are not to beunderstood as the grosser physical form of mucoid secretions or blood, but as theirsubtler counterparts imbued with qualities that are analogous to the alchemicalelements that are involved in the process of spiritual transformation.The subject of kalas is a complex one, for the production of the kalas depends on theoccult capability of the priestess as well as on their manipulation by the priest. Thereare astrological and astronomical considerations and ritual requirements to ensure theproper condensation of these essences at the right time so that they may be employedfor magical ends.Basically, the word kla indicates a unit of time, most specifically a lunar “digit” orday. Different authorities offer different definitions and identifications of this lunarday. In some cases, it refers to about one-day-and-a-half in solar days, or about 36hours. In other cases, the authorities insist that each lunar day is equivalent in length toa solar day, only calculated from dusk to dusk rather than from dawn to dawn, etc.Those familiar with Vedic astrology are familiar with this term and with a related termtithi, which means the same thing but which is used more often in astrology than in theTantras.The important thing to remember here is that the lunar cycle is really the result ofthe interplay between the moon, the earth and the sun. If we consider the earth to be avessel for the mingled essences of the sun and moon—a traditional Tantric concept—then the importance of the kala becomes apparent. On different days of the lunar cycle,as the moon gradually waxes from a New Moon to a Full Moon, and then begins towane again, the quality of moonlight (it's brightness) changes from night to night. The"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Indian astrologers and Tantrikas imagine this to be the Sun giving the precious Somato the Moon, drop by drop, until the Moon is full, at which point it begins returning theSoma to the Sun, also drop by drop, until it is depleted; and then the whole cyclebegins again. Each lunar day has a specific quality associated with it, as well as aspecific deity. It is this concept that is related to the Tantric idea of kalas that Grantwrites about so frequently. Each lunar digit or kala has a different quality. When thisquality is combined with the individual menstrual cycle of the priestess, then you havea different “tincture” or essence.Central to Indian religion and especially to Tantra is the concept of amrita. Amritais the combination of the male and female potencies that ensures immortality, and thepower to cure illness. It is the source of western ideas about the elixir vitae and thePhilosopher's Stone. It is the result of an internal process of meditation, yoga, andritual but also involves alignment with the priest or priestess as well as with the lunarphases themselves. It is an interlocking of the microcosm with the macrocosm—thehuman body with the stars—in a way that transcends how this is understood by thenewcomer to ceremonial magic and alchemy. The sensitivity of the female partner toher menstrual cycle and the corresponding sensitivity of the male partner to the femalepartner—coupled with: (1) the awareness of both to the external “cycle” of the sun andmoon, and (2) the proper performance of rituals that are undertaken with a great dealof personal preparation (particularly in the psycho-biological processes which aresubsumed under the control of the autonomic nervous system: in particular breathing,heart rate, etc.)—provides a vehicle for spiritual transformation that would be difficultto surpass. As one identifies oneself with the Goddess through the normal stages of theSri Vidya puja, but with these other considerations honored, then the goal of advaita ornon-duality is obtained through identification of the Goddess with the universe, theuniverse with the Goddess, and eventually identification of the Self with No-Self: thetranscending of opposites and the attainment of samadhi.In the earlier stages of the process—which can take many years to perfect—theamrita is cultivated, taking care that it does not become a poison instead of a medicine.The Tantras are full of instructions towards this end, although they may at times seemincomprehensible as they are written in the “twilight language” common to all thedeeper forms of esotericism both in Asia and in the West. The amrita is the combinedessences of the male and female practitioner, as has been described, with the caveatthat it is not the grosser elements that are important, for they are only the vehicle forthe subtle powers they represent. Only accomplished Tantrikas—or, in the Westerncontext, magicians—are capable of generating these subtle essences. As can be seen,the Gnostic Mass would be capable of this function in only the most advanced case, aswell as the Star Sapphire ritual which makes use of the same ideas. But is there really aconnection between the Tantras that Grant praises so highly and Thelema? Aside fromthe obvious similarities, there is other evidence to show that there might be a stronger"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"connection than previously understood.As Tantric scholar David Gordon White describes in his The Alchemical Body:Siddha Traditions in Medieval India:In the royal consumption origin myth ... the moon was revived and replenishedin its bright fortnight through the offering of a soma sacrifice. Soma is the fluidessence of the moon, which, in the sacrificial context, must be bought. Withwhat does King Moon buy back his vital fluids? With a red cow, whose name,rohin, is the same as that of the starry woman who was the original cause of hiswoes.124This is a rich vein of symbolism that could be mined by any Kabbalist with greatbenefit. As scholar of Judaism Rafael Patai and Kabbalah scholar Moshe Idel haveboth indicated in their writings, Tantra may very well have been the unseen influencebehind European and Middle Eastern forms of alchemy and Kabbalah. In this singlemyth, we have an indication that there was some cross-fertilization between Jewishmysticism and Tantric alchemy in startling ways.As Jewish scholars know, a red cow (sometimes called a red heifer, a parah adumah in Hebrew) is required for the purification of anyone who came into contactwith a corpse (Numbers, 19:2–19). The cow had to be unblemished, completely red,and had never been yoked or used to perform any work. It would be sacrificed andburned, its ashes placed in a ritual vessel that contains pure “living” water, i.e. from aspring as opposed to collected rain water. Along with the ashes of the red cow, cedarand hyssop are also burned along with the cow, as well as wool that has been dyed red.The resulting water is then sprinkled on a contaminated person using a branch ofhyssop.It is a requirement to have the ashes of a red cow available in the Temple, and forthat reason the building of a Third Temple in Jerusalem could not take place until sucha red cow had been found that would be a suitable candidate for this ritual requirement.There is no logical argument for this requirement, no reference to other sources thatwould provide a context for this rather bizarre ritual, and for that reason Talmudicscholars consider it to be a divine mandate. But the connection between a red cow,ritual purity, and living water seems to have a precedent in ancient India and the abovecitation offers a way towards understanding this rather arcane stipulation.The word rohin is the key. It does not mean “red cow” specifically but simply “thered one.” It is the name of a Goddess, the “starry woman” of the citation, and isassigned to one of the nakshatras—the rohini nakshatra—which is the starAldebaran,125 found in the constellation Taurus, or the Bull. Rohini is the wife ofChandra, a lunar deity who is identified with Soma. The symbols for Rohini/Aldebaranare the Temple and the Chariot.Thus we have a Red Goddess, a Red Cow, the waters of purification and Soma, and"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"the Temple. The Moon must buy a red cow and offer it in exchange for Soma, whichseems to be a myth cognate to the idea of a red cow being burned and its ashes used tocreate purifying water. Add to that the symbolic connection to Aldebaran and theTemple and you seem to have a perfect explanation for the Jewish requirement.Further, the fact that the symbol of the Chariot is also included takes us into another,deeper realm entirely. The “descent to the Chariot” is a practice known in the Jewishmystical practice of the Merkavah (“chariot”) also known as Hekhalot (“palace”) mysticism. The aim of the practice is to ascend seven levels, or chariots, orpalaces, to finally appear before the Throne of God. I have made the case elsewherethat this ancient mystical practice was the inspiration for the degree rituals of theGolden Dawn, which then became the basis for Aleister Crowley's AA degreestructure.126There is more evidence that this may be correct. In that in various worldmythologies Aldebaran is usually connected to the constellation of the Pleiades, the“Seven Sisters,” in the same way that the asterism of the Big Dipper consists of sevenstars that are called “the Chariot” in Middle Eastern (and Chinese) cultures. Theysurround the Pole Star which forms the Throne of God in this system, because it isunmoving and eternal, the axis around which the world turns.This entire complex of ideas is reprised in the Thelemic idea of the Scarlet Woman,Babalon, as the partner of Therion and whose relationship with the Beast provides theSoma, the life-giving elixir.To continue the astronomical theme one step further, the brightest supernova explosionever recorded in human history took place in the year 1006 CE. It occurred on April 30of that year, which is—as the Necronomicon tells us—the “day the Great Bear hangsfrom its tail in the sky,” i.e., the day the Gate between this world and the next isopened. On the same day, the volcanic eruption of Mount Merapi on the Indonesianisland of Java destroyed an entire civilization and buried the spectacular monumentBorobudur. It lay under volcanic ash and vegetation for centuries before beingrediscovered and eventually reconsecrated by the Dalai Lama—recognized as a templeof Vajrayana, i.e. Tantric, Buddhism.The supernova occurred in a constellation known to the ancients as Therion. TheBeast.These ancient cults—of the Yezidi, of the Afro-Caribbean religions and their secretsocieties, and of the Tantrikas—are carriers of specific information that moderncultists find indispensable for an understanding of their own traditions, rites, andpractices. But these practices are dangerous. They involve trafficking with the contentsof the unconscious mind through manipulation of psycho-biological processes that arestill little-understood and recognized even less. To writers like Grant and Lovecraft,"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"they are analogous to trafficking with supramundane entities ... not “analogous” in theway the word is normally used, but perhaps better understood in the sense of“analogue” as opposed to “digital.” To Grant and Lovecraft, plumbing the depths of theunconscious mind is not metaphorically similar to plumbing the depths of deep space,they are different ways of expressing the same thing. The practices may be analoguesof each other to the non-initiate, but they meet in the rituals and practices of the adept,of the initiate.The most ancient mysteries were of a physical, not a metaphysical nature. Therewas an esoteric and an exoteric version of them, corresponding to the writtenand the oral Law of the Jews. But, contrary to what is usually supposed, themetaphysical was the exoteric version, not vice versa.... The secret, oral, orhidden wisdom embodied in the gloss [to the seventeenth chapter of theEgyptian Book of the Dead], refers to the physical origins of the abstractconcepts which appear in the text; spiritual matters are experienced in terms ofphysical, more precisely of physiological, phenomena.12789 Should probably read Unaussprechliche Kulte.90 One of the earliest sources was the famous British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard in his Nineveh and ItsRemains, London, John Murray, 1849. Articles on the Yezidi had appeared in French a few years earlier by M.Boré in his “De la vie religieuse chez les Chaldéens” in two parts, July and August 1843, in the Annales dePhilosophie Chrétienne. Isya Joseph published some preliminary articles on the Yezidi in the American Journal ofSemitic Languages and Literatures, in January and April, 1909 in a two-part series entitled “Yezidi Texts.” Thesewould be followed by his book Devil Worship in 1919. Another book-length treatment of the subject was The Cultof the Peacock Angel by R.H.W. Empson, London, Witherby, 1928, appearing a year after Crowley associateWilliam Seabrook's Adventures in Arabia: Among the Bedouins, Druses, Whirling Dervishes, and Yezidee DevilWorshippers, 1927; New York, Blue Ribbon, 1930. For a more recent and scholarly source, see John Guest, TheYezidis: A Study in Survival, London, Routledge, Kegan and Paul, 1987, and Giulia Sfameni Gasparro, “I MitiCosmogonici Degli Yezidi” in Numen, Vol. XXI, Fasc. 3, pp. 197-227, and Vol. XXII, Fasc. 1, pp. 24-41, Leiden,Brill, 1974. It should be noted that Crowley's identification with Sumer predates the appearance of popular bookson the subject by at least ten years.91 See for instance J.F. Coakley, “Manuscripts for sale: Urmia. 1890-2” in Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies,Vol. 20, no.2, 2006 where the trade of one Jeremiah Shamir in Mosul was cited as a source for documents ofdubious provenance. See the Encyclopedia Iranica, online edition, New York, 1996- entry, “Jelwa, Ketab Al-” forthe reasons (mostly linguistic) behind this claim. Also see the above cited book by John Guest for moreinformation on Shamir.92 One author has suggested that the word Ta'us comes from Ta'uz, a form of the ancient Babylonian godTammuz. Empson, op.cit., p. 184. If so, this would further bolster at least a Babylonian (if not Sumerian)connection to the Yezidis.93 The theory that the ancient Sumerians might have come to Mesopotamia from India is one of the options beingseriously considered by linguists and physical anthropologists. That they were non-Semitic seems to be generallyaccepted. That their origins are mysterious and shrouded in the eldritch tendrils of the mists of antiquity is alsoaccepted. See for instance Arkadiusz Sohysiak, “Physical anthropology and the ‘Sumerian problem,'” in Studies inHistorical Anthropology, vol. 4:2004 [2006], pp 145-158 for an overview of the prevailing theories. At any rate,this new theory is consistent with what the Yezidi say about themselves. It is also implied in the Schlangekraftrecension of the Necronomicon when it is attested that the symbol of the Sumerian “race” is the Ar with “Aryan”"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"as cognate.94 See, for instance, Empson, op. cit., p. 174-175.95 Nineveh, discovered by the archaeologist Layard who also wrote of his meeting with the Yezidis, was anancient city famously cursed by the Biblical prophet Nahum, who called it a “harlot that was beautiful andagreeable and that made use of witchcraft ...” (Nahum 3:4), as good a Biblical description of Crowley's Babalon asany. Nineveh was also the city where Jonah was sent to preach, and from where he subsequently fled to the sea,only to find himself swallowed by a whale. There is today a shrine to Jonah at Nineveh, believed to be his tomb.96 Kenneth Grant, Outer Gateways, p. 9297 Agharta is frequently confused with Shambhala. Shambhala is a well-known Tibetan Buddhist concept, whichbecame the “Shangri-La” of Hollywood fame. The origin of the word Agharta and the mythology connected withit is ambiguous and possibly a fictional creation of European travelers and mystics. The Theosophists believe it is akind of polar opposite to Shambhala and the domain of demonic forces.98 As may be observed in the beliefs and practices of the Qumran sect that gave us the Dead Sea Scrolls. TheQumranites set themselves up as the true Jews in opposition to the Jerusalem Temple Jews.99 Empson, op. cit., p. 183.100 William B. Seabrook, Jungle Ways, London, George G. Harrap, 1931.101 William B. Seabrook, Adventures in Arabia: Among the Bedouins, Druses, Whirling Dervishes, and YezideeDevil Worshippers, 1927; New York, Blue Ribbon, 1930.102 Kenneth Grant, Outer Gateways, p. 106.103 This claim is made by Crowley in several places, as we have seen. In his Cephaloedium Working (1920), he isquite clear in the statement that lists his titles: “... whose Holy Angel his Guardian is Aiwaz 93, the God firstdawning upon Man in the land of Sumer....”104 Indeed, as one Yezidi leader said to a journalist at the time of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2002, Melek Ta'usmeans “the ancient one.” (Patrick Graham, “Iraq's ‘Devil Worshippers'” in the Canadian National Post, December17, 2002.) This fits perfectly with the terminology used in the Necronomicon Gnosis.105 A symbol that also appears in the Schlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon many times on the variousseals of the planetary forces as well as prominently on the Crown of Anu (p. 112).106 Grant, Outer Gateways, p. 103. Acording to Grant the word Yezid signifies one of the three persons in one“god” of the Yezidi, the other two being Melek Ta'us and Sheikh Adi, the latter of whom many scholars assumewas the real creator of the Yezidi clan although this is still hotly contested.

This secret religion, stealthily handed down amongstpeasants for thousands of years despite the outward reign of the Druidic,Graeco-Roman, and Christian faiths in the regions involved, was marked bywild “Witches' Sabbaths” in lonely woods and atop distant hills or Walpurgis-Night and Hallowe'en ...—H. P. Lovecraft128The deathless Chinamen said that there were double meanings in theNecronomicon ...—H. P. Lovecraft129HIDEOUS CULT, NOCTURNAL WORSHIPPERS, revolting fertility rites ... double meanings. Itis this last that gives us pause because it so eloquently reveals both Lovecraft's owntimidity when it comes to sexuality and religion as well as the basis for the Thelemic,Necro-nomicon and Egyptian currents upon which Grant expounds throughout all ninevolumes of his Typhonian Trilogies.Fertility rites.One could make the case that Tantra is essentially the survival of some more ancientfertility cult operative throughout the sub-continent, perhaps before the Aryaninvasions, and that our concepts of lingam and yoni, amrita, and Shiva and Shakti allderive from this practice “of immemorial antiquity.” After all, some Tantricpractitioners do indeed meet “nocturnally” in remote places to carry out their “fertilityrites.”It is this type of public relations effort, carried out not only by Lovecraft but by theWestern media in general, that made Tantra and its associated beliefs and practicesseem so exotic and forbidden, pretty much substantiating Edward Said's insistence thatvirtually all Western approaches to Asia were racist and condescending.However, in the case of Tantra in particular it was not only the white colonialistclass that was appalled by these practices but members of the established Brahmin"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"classes of India as well. Nothing disturbs a member of the social and religious elitequite so much as discovering groups of men and women, together, at night, in acremation ground, worshipping the gods and possibly even having sex in a ritualsetting. The very concept would make a Vedic (and a Catholic) priest's head explode.(There is also, of course, the implied threat to the social order and specifically to theorthodox priesthood represented by independent religious practitioners communicatingdirectly with the gods in an unapproved manner.)Sexuality is such a central feature of human life everywhere on the planet that todescribe any social group or organization that is in any way non-traditional orantinomian is to suggest that it's sexual practices are also bizarre, or strange, orunorthodox. It would be difficult to make the case for an American satanicorganization, for instance, that practiced the Black Mass as the core ritual of their faith—and whose members were all celibate (by choice or by doctrine) or scrupulouslyfaithful to their spouses. We associate anti-religions with liberation,130 because weidentify religion with restraint, with rules, with doctrines involving the human passionsand the attempt to corral them into socially-acceptable channels. Thus any anti-churchworth its salt would incorporate sexual liberation or even sexual “depravity” as part ofits repertoire.The Necronomicon Sigil is a compsite of the three signs of ARRA (the Sign ofour Race), AGGA (the Elder Sign), and BANDAR (the Sigil of the Watcher).But Lovecraft went a step further. Since he did not identify any of the existingreligions and their gods as the “hideous cults” of which he writes (except from a few"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"choice asides to the Yezidi in the short story “The Horror at Red Hook”), he inventedanother religious entity entirely. He wanted a cult that was older than anything onearth, older than any historically-verifiable religion, something so old that it wouldhave appeared ancient to the pre-dynastic Egyptians and the Sumerians (arguably theoldest civilization on record). It would be the Ur-cult, the original religion, and itsorigins would be as mysterious and murky as the origins of the human race itself: thestars.At the same time, Lovecraft understood that the occult rituals of the West and theEast—in particular ceremonial magic for the former and shamanism for the latter—could be employed as means of making contact with these forces: forces that heclaimed were still interested in returning to the earth, but who had been prevented fromdoing so because of certain spells that had been cast that closed the Gate between thisworld and theirs, and which kept their chief priest—the dread Cthulhu—”dead butdreaming” in his sunken city of R'lyeh ... waiting for the moment when “the stars areright” and his devotees on earth chant the right chants and raise him from his grave toinvoke the Old Ones once more. The satanic cults of the world—the devil-worshipping,secretive, murderous, or otherwise unorthodox and antinomian—were survivals of thisoriginal cult and were keeping its blasphemous memory alive.Lovecraft's theme is not as internally consistent as the above paragraph wouldsuggest. Lovecraft himself tinkered with it in his stories, and other contributors addedto the legends in their own tales, creating what has been called the Cthulhu Mythos.We will not attempt to delineate all the moving parts of the Mythos here, but onlyfocus on those elements that concern what Grant calls the Necronomicon Mythos,which he sees as one manifestation of the underground current that supplies the fuelfor Thelema. This is the most contentious aspect of the Thelema gestalt—for manymembers of the OTO and allied groups are vehemently opposed to Grant's concept ofThelema, and especially to any addition of elements from the stories of H. P.Lovecraft, which they feel are “fictional” and “imaginary” and thus have no place intheir religion. (Atheists will find this attitude rather ironic, no doubt.)Grant's response to this has been to emphasize the importance of the artistic inreligion, and especially in Thelema. There were artists, writers, musicians, dancers,and actors surrounding Crowley for most of his life, becoming involved in Thelema togreater or lesser degrees and contributing to the culture of his movement. Imagination,creativity, and vision are essential aspects of the artistic arsenal, which are elements ofthe magical environment as well. Inasmuch as Thelema's origins are patently magical,the close association of art and Thelema cannot be denied. Crowley considered himselfto be the greatest living poet in the world, among other things. He also painted,organized theatrical troupes such as the Ragged Ragtime Girls, and conducted the Ritesof Eleusis as public performance in a theater, the last an indication that he understoodthe role of ritual as drama and of drama as ritual. He also wrote short stories and"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"novels, such as the revealing Moonchild, which incorporates elements of the GoldenDawn, the AA, ceremonial magic in general, Asian religions, etc. all wrapped upin a Thelemic context but with allusions to world events (thus embroidering upon theparanoid fantasy that all world events are orchestrated by a secret society of satanicmagicians). Moonchild is a roman-a-clef, with many of Crowley's friends and enemiesportrayed in ways that would amuse only Crowley and anyone else in on the joke. Butthe occult and magical aspects of Moonchild are the most valuable aspect of the novel.Crowley used the novel as a medium for transmitting occult information. Why, then,would we deny Lovecraft the same capability if not the intention?Lovecraft's understanding was quite similar. His most influential work, the shortstory “The Call of Cthulhu,” is specific in its depiction of artists as the first people onthe planet to become aware that something cosmic was taking place involving the racefrom the stars and the sinister, slumbering high priest, Cthulhu. Some of thisawareness is communicated through dreams, and dream control is a key element of theGrant technique.Take for example these quotes first from Lovecraft and then from Grant:It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I knowthat panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes....These responses from esthetes told a disturbing tale. From February 28 to April2 a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things, the intensity ofthe dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor'sdelirium.... and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the giganticnameless thing visible towards the last.131Certain fugitive elements appear occasionally in the works of poets, painters,mystics, and occultists which may be regarded as genuine magicalmanifestations in that they demonstrate the power and ability of the artist toevoke elements of an extradimensional and alien universe that may be capturedonly by the most sensitive and delicately adjusted antennae of humanconsciousness.132The sculptor referred to in the first quotation is young Wilcox, who has been havingstrange dreams and visions the result of which is art that seems to suggest theexistence of alien beings. It is the sculpture left behind by Wilcox that instigates theinvestigation of the Cthulhu Cult, a search that ranges from Providence, Rhode Islandto New Orleans, Louisiana to the South Pacific—with side trips to parts of Asia. At thesame time that Wilcox is having his unearthly experience artists from around the worldare reporting the same type of experience, sometimes with deadly results as some goinsane, or kill themselves.In the second quotation, Grant shows that he is agreeing with Lovecraft's analysis"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"and explains the phenomenon as representing “genuine magical manifestations.” Thisis a key statement, one that Grant uses to justify his use of the Lovecraft material in hisTyphonian mythos. One either agrees at this point, or does not. If one disagrees withGrant, then the rest of the Typhonian material makes no sense at all, and can beconsidered the ramblings of a paranoid schizophrenic or a visionary artist fallen onhard times ... or hard drugs. But then, if one disagrees with Grant, one is tempted toreview all of the Thelemic material in the same light, for Crowley received the Book ofthe Law under very arcane (if not actually suspicious) circumstances. Crowley insistedthat his revelations were true, and so his followers take them as truth while the rest ofthe world dismisses them as fiction. Lovecraft insisted that his stories were fiction, andso his fans take them as fiction ... even as Grant and his followers believe that theLovecraft short stories are genuine transmissions of Thelemic knowledge.It is important to understand that Grant places a great deal of importance on what hecalls “dream control” and devotes a chapter to it in his Outer Gateways:Dream actions are a clue to the magical condition of the subliminal self. ... Thedream is all we may know, normally, of the fourth dimension while we areembodied three-dimensionally. But we are not so embodied while dreaming. Weare then already a step ahead, even although we are still viewing the scene fromanother dimension, an inner dimension, which differs from dreamless sleep inthat it is not totally formless and void. This extra dimension is the Mauve Zone.Surrealists, futurists, cubists, abstractionists, were groping towards itsexpression.133Here we have the connection between dream control, the Mauve Zone (the nameGrant gives for the Abyss or for a belt of dark power encircling the Abyss), and theartist, which is basically a description of what was taking place in Lovecraft's story. By“artist” here Grant is not indicating the painter of still-lifes or portraits, of course, butthe avant-garde practitioner of Surrealism and the other movements that came out ofthe first World War. Surrealism in particular is important to the study of magic andesotericism because it used psychology, automatic writing, the Tarot and other formsof “discarded religion” in an effort to create works of art that would act as initiatorypowers in their own right, through shocking an audience or causing them to view theworld in a way that was not comfortable or “normal.” By juxtaposing unrelatedelements in a poem, a drawing, or other artform, a dream-like state was experienced inour dimension as if an urgent message was being received from Grant's Mauve Zone.Thus Grant was able to see in Lovecraft's stories—particularly those of the CthulhuMythos—a message from the stars as important (or, at least, as relevant) as thatreceived by Crowley. Possibly Lovecraft resisted the message because he loathed themessenger: the creepy, hideous beings that Grant calls “Typhonian Teratomas”134:monstrous offspring created by the intercourse between humans and alien forms of life"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"and the source of Lovecraft's vision of “revolting fertility rites of immemorialantiquity.” In stories like “The Dunwich Horror,” Lovecraft suggests the possibilitythat humans and alien beings could mate and produce children who would then behideously ugly and possessed of strange abilities. The idea that humans couldsomehow mate with gods, demons, and other beings is a staple of much European andMiddle Eastern religion and legend. The Greek and Roman myths are full of such tales,and in the Babylonian Talmud and in various Kabbalistic and other texts we havereferences to Lilith, the Queen of the Night, sometimes as the first spouse of Adam andthe demons as her children with the evil spirit Samael.135 Most famously in the West,the story of the sons of God and the “daughters of men” (Genesis 6:4) seems to tell asimilar story of unholy intercourse between two different beings, one human and onenot-quite-human.Lovecraft was a lover of science and an atheist; he claimed more than once in hisvoluminous correspondence that his stories were pure fantasy, with no relationship toanything real, but perhaps motivated by his intellectual horror of the vast expanses ofspace that seem to dwarf all human aspiration and potential. He also had a definite fearand loathing of other races, races he saw as degenerate forms of human life, monstrousthrowbacks or deviations along the evolutionary path. While we can regard his nativeracism with pity or contempt, we can also see beyond it to realize that it is consistentwith his fiction. In Lovecraft's tales nothing good can come of the mating of humanswith the Old Ones. The genetic anomalies that result would throw the world open to theravages of these uncaring, oblivious, and insane beings from planets so far from oursthat they would be invisible to even the strongest of telescopes.Mating with the gods, in other words, opens the Gate.“The thing has gone for ever,” Armitage said. “It has been split up into what itwas originally made of, and can never exist again. It was an impossibility in anormal world. Only the least fraction was really matter in any sense we know. Itwas like its father—and most of it has gone back to him in some vague realm ofdimension outside our material universe; some vague abyss out of which onlythe most accursed rites of human blasphemy could ever have called him for amoment on the hills. ...You needn't ask how Wilbur called it out of the air. Hedidn't call it out. It was his twin brother, but it looked more like the father thanhe did.”136In the above quotation from Lovecraft, we learn of the magician Wilbur Whateleyand his dark rites conducted on an altar in a circle of standing stones, and thesummoning forth of a murderous entity from “some vague abyss,” i.e., analogous toGrant's Mauve Zone. Wilbur and the monster were twins, because their human mother—Lavinia Whateley, “a somewhat deformed, unattractive albino woman of 35”—hadmated with a mysterious, unknown supramundane entity, their father. Lavinia's own"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"father was a wizard of some repute, which explains how she came into contact with thealien being in the first place. And Wilbur Whately, her son? He was born on February2, 1913, the date known as Candlemas to the Christian world and as Imbolc or Oimelcto the pagan world: one of the cross-quarter days that are so important to the pre-Christian calendar, coming as they do halfway between the quarter days (i.e., thesolstices and equinoxes that are sacred to the solar cult because they represent stages inthe sun's progress through the zodiac). The cross-quarter days are the places“between,” and it is this “inbetweenness” that attracts the attention of both Lovecraftand Grant.Further, the choice of February 2 is illustrative of another aspect to Lovecraft'swork: his deliberate use of symbols. To the pagan, pre-Christian world that day wascalled Imbolc, an Old Irish word that means “in the belly,” a reference to pregnancy. Itis a suggestive date to use for the birthing of a monster, sired by a pre-Christianancient God or Devil.As an aside we should note that Lovecraft is always careful to use precise dates inhis stories. There is no poetic ambiguity there, no referencing of the month but not theyear as one finds in most stories and novels. Lovecraft always insists on specificity inhis chronologies, and it is this aspect of his work that makes it so valuable to thoselooking for connections to real-world events especially as it seems Lovecraft isdeliberately trying to tell us something. Because of this characteristic we were able toidentify Crowley's fevered writing of some of the Thelemic Holy Books at a time whenLovecraft claimed there were orgiastic rites to Cthulhu taking place in New Orleans ...inspired by an Unholy Book: the Necronomicon.The month of February, 1913 was an important one in the art world for it signalledthe public appearance in New York City of Surrealist works by Marcel Duchamp.Surrealism is singled out by Grant to be one of the artforms most influenced by occultor magical currents. Only a few days earlier, in January of 1913, Kafka would putdown the pen on his unfinished novel Amerika forever. But it was during 1913 thatCrowley would write the Gnostic Mass, which we have discussed previously, as well ashis famous Hymn to Pan.The previous year was when Theodor Reuss visited Crowley in London and accusedhim of printing the IXth degree secret of the OTO in his Book of Lies, specifically thechapter devoted to the Star Sapphire ritual. He then admitted Crowley to the IXthdegree of the OTO, as mentioned previously, and then Crowley was put in charge ofthe OTO operations in the British Isles.So, when “Wilbur Whateley” was born, Crowley was embarking on the game-changing actions that would make him the leader of one of the most famous Westernsecret societies of the twentieth century. As we have seen above, Crowley believed thatthe Egyptian gods Horus and Set were “twins”: that they personified the double wandof power, as they represented the union of Lower and Upper Egypt respectively. Horus"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"was the “good” god, and Set was the Evil One. Thus, perhaps Wilbur Whateley was the“good” twin and his brother—the monstrous thing they had to destroy—was the EvilOne, the Set to Wilbur's Horus.While these associations may seem fanciful, we need only remember how definitivewere Lovecraft's stories when matched against corresponding dates and events inThelema. In order to understand the Necronomicon Gnosis it is necessary to graspsome of the essential elements as transcribed by Lovecraft (and those of his circle) andthen to “port” them over to Thelemic elements and note their correspondence. IfLovecraft received many of his ideas through his dreams, as he often admitted inwriting to friends, then his process was consistent with Grant's dream control theoryand practice. What is startling is that the dreams of Lovecraft would so neatlycorrespond to the inspirations received by Crowley.They were both dreaming the same dream.The reader will remember that the frenzied orgy taking place in the swamps outsideNew Orleans in Lovecraft's “The Call of Cthulhu” occurred on the same day thatCrowley was writing several of what would be known as the “Holy Books.” However,there are other coincidences that bear inspection.For instance, in “The Call of Cthulhu” the young sculptor Wilcox visits ProfessorGeorge Angell during the period February 28 to April 2, 1925. This is the time whenother artists, mediums and sensitives are experiencing similar visions around theworld. Lovecraft has selected this period with care, for there was an earthquake onFebruary 28, 1925 that affected the northeastern United States and Canada. This sameearthquake is used by Lovecraft as a device that enables a sunken city beneath thewaves of the Pacific Ocean to rise to the surface. While the earthquake in question didnot occur in the Pacific, it was obviously the inspiration for the earthquake in the story.It is compelling to realize that this is a phenomenon that actually has occurred andwithin recent history. The famous earthquake and tsunami of December 26, 2004, thattook more than 200,000 lives in Asia from Indonesia and Thailand to India, also hadthe effect of raising an entire undersea temple off the eastern coast of India.This was the fabled Mahabalipuram Temple of the Seven Pagodas, built in the 8thcentury CE. Only one of the seven “pagodas” had survived into the modern age, the so-called “Shore Temple” believed to be one of the original seven. Just before the tsunamistruck, local residents saw the ocean pull away from the coastline as if being inhaledby something far out to sea. As the ocean rolled away, the sunken temple complex wasrevealed, showing the missing pagodas, only to be swallowed again when the roilingsea water returned. It was as if the sunken city of R'lyeh had materialized out ofnowhere as an homage to Lovecraft. That it was an Indian temple seemed to indicate aresonance between the Necronomicon Gnosis and the Tantric interpretation by KennethGrant."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The period of general weirdness, insanity and troubled dreams depicted in “The Callof Cthulhu” as beginning with the earthquake of February 28 ends on April 2, 1925which is the day that an important meeting of the Surrealists took place in Paris, ameeting that would decide how the artistic movement would become politically active,and which produced the Memorandum of the Surrealist Revolution. Lovecraft neverrefers to this meeting, of course, and it is doubtful whether or not he would have beenaware of it at all. However, the bookending of an earthquake on one side and theSurrealist Memorandum on the other is perfectly consistent with Lovecraft's storyline.The shattering effect of the earthquake that shakes the sunken city where Cthulhu liesdead but dreaming, causing him to awaken from his ancient slumber, and the “certainstate of fury”137 that informed the Surrealist movement as these avant-garde artistsstruggled with altered states of consciousness and altered political states ... all of thisbecomes part of the Love-craftian Zeitgeist. The earthquake awakens Cthulhu, and theartists—the most avant-garde, the most sensitive to occultism, depth psychology, andautomatic writing—assemble in a “certain state of fury” to decide how artistictransgression and political transgression can work together to cause the destruction ofcivilization as they knew it. The dreams of the Surrealists bled over into the dreams ofthe Communists, and these dreams were seeded by the high priest of the Old Ones whoneeds social unrest and dislocation to give his followers the space to perform the orgianecessary to open the channels, the Gates, to the Underworld.Kenneth Grant may be characterized as the analyst interpreting these dreams, not forthe sake of the dreamers but for those of us who struggle to understand the dreamcontent and how it may be relevant to a study of magic and religion in the 21st century.Grant reveals how the Lovecraft material expands upon the data received by Crowleywith virtually no reference to the Golden Dawn-type atmosphere of the latter.Lovecraft is seeing what Crowley sees, only he sees it from the perspective of anoutsider, someone for whom the symbol-set of the fin-de-siecle British secret societyhas no meaning and provides no context; and for whom the initiatory structure of theGolden Dawn is not available to protect him from the experience. Instead, Lovecraftsees it raw, unfiltered. And that is what frightens him.The basic features of the Necronomicon Gnosis may be reduced to a few convenientelements. The first is Cthulhu himself.Lovecraft refers to Cthulhu as the high priest of the Old Ones and thus may not bean Old One himself. At least, he is not one of the ancient Gods but is a priest of thoseGods. The physical description of Cthulhu shows that he is not human by any stretch ofthe imagination, with his octopus-like head replete with tentacles. One is reminded ofthe Egyptian gods who are often depicted as beings with humanoid bodies but withanimal heads. What Lovecraft is implying in his stories is that those are the actualphysical characteristics of the gods and not some sophisticated symbolic"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"interpretation. Conversely, we could say that—if applying the Egyptian standards toLovecraft's Cthulhu—that Cthulhu does not really have an octopus head but that it isLovecraft's way of implying octopus-like characteristics.The Schlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon—i.e., the “Simonomicon”—translates the name Cthulhu as Kutulu: a Sumerian neologism meaning “Man of theUnderworld.” He is, according to this interpretation, a psychopomp, a guide to theOther World, to the Mauve Zone. He is a liminal figure standing at the crossroads ofthis world and the next. The word kutu has a double meaning: it refers not only to theUnderworld but to a specific city in ancient Sumer, Cutha or Gudua. The city itself wasconsidered to be the location of an entrance to the Underworld and, as mentionedpreviously, it was the home city of the Qureish, the tribe to which the ProphetMuhammad belonged and which was in charge of the Ka'aba when it was a paganshrine to the Moon God, Hubal.There is a thus a rich vein of symbolism to be mined in the word Cthulhu. As theeditor of the Necronomicon, Simon, points out the word may also be a subtle play onthe term cthonic, a word used in anthropology and religious studies to mean“underground” or “under the earth” when referencing gods and spirits that are believedto dwell below the surface of the earth. The pronounciation of the word cthonic in theOxford English Dictionary is precisely “ka-tonic” and may have also given Lovecraftthe pun necessary for his famous Miskatonic University: the fictional location wherethe dreaded Necronomicon itself is kept under lock and key in the rare book room.At some point in the far distant past the Old Ones were in control of this planet.When they left, Cthulhu remained behind as their lone contact and high priest but hewas defeated in some manner and entombed—either beneath the earth or beneath thewaves, in the sunken city of R'lyeh—and remains in that state until he can be awakenedby his human followers on earth, when the “stars are right.” In his present state he is“dead but dreaming,” like a vampire in the coffin; except a vampire may come alive atthe setting of the sun, every day, but Cthulhu can only come alive when the stars areright, i.e., when the constellations themselves are aligned in such a way as to provide achannel for the Old Ones to return. There is assumed to be a sort of ritual mechanismin which human followers of the Old Ones can perform an appropriate ceremony at anappropriate time and this will serve to awaken Cthulhu so he can begin his ritual forsummoning the Old Ones back to earth. The right ceremony at the right time opens theGate between this world and the next.While it seems melodramatic and outlandish in Lovecraft's stories, this is exactlywhat the medieval European magicians believed. The timing of the ritual wasextremely important in order for the angels and demons to be properly evoked. InGrant's own system, timing is just as important for the sexually-based rituals of hismodified Tantra. The kalas—a word that suggests the Sanskrit term for “time” as inKalacakra or “Wheel of Time”—are essences secreted by a woman on different days"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"of her menstrual cycle. It was most likely the lunar phases in the heavens and themenstrual cycle on earth that first suggested the measurement of time and periodicityto pre-historic civilizations. The alignment of the lunar cycle with the menstrual cycleis an essential element of Grant's Tantra; alignments of the planetary cycles arethemselves essential to the successful practice of ceremonial magic.To Lovecraft, the proper alignment of the stars is never described fully. It is a secretscience, known only to the worshippers of Cthulhu and the Old Ones. They alonepossess the knowledge of how the stars would appear when they were “right.” Again,there is precedence in Western and Asian astrology.To most people in the West, astrology is essentially solar astrology. It is based onthe passage of the Sun through the zodiacal belt. In India, however, astrology issidereal: it is based on the actual positions of the planets when viewed against the starsof the zodiac rather than on a constant (solar) calendar date. Thus, people who believethemselves to be a Libran in the West may very well discover to their shock that inIndia they are said to be Virgoans. This is due to the precession of the equinoxes thatwas mentioned previously. Thus, when the “stars are right” in Europe they may not beright in India.Add to this confusion the plethora of indigenous calendars around the world, none ofwhich are exact matches for the others, and you have time-keeping systems that areunique to each culture. Java, for instance, has at least five calendars in use. Theirdiviners use all five in determining personal characteristics of the newborn, the bestdays for starting an enterprise, planting crops, etc.The European magicians had complex tables showing the rulership of each day andeach hour within the day, rulerships that changed with the day of the week. Previous tothe rather arbitrary assigment of planets to days and hours, however, were theBabylonian systems of astrology that included not only planets and zodiacalconstellations but also a whole host of fixed stars as well as comets and otherastronomical phenomena. The Babylonian astrologers actually watched the heavens ona constant, unending basis (something which many of our contemporary astrologerswould be uinin-terested or incapable of doing, spoiled as they are by computerizedcalculations and real-time simulations of the heavens). They did not view the astralpositions as purely symbolic but kept an eye on the skies alert to any new message, anynew prediction. Thus, an Ur-cult such as the one we have been suggesting would use an“astrology” that was rather more astronomy than astrology, although partaking ofelements of each.That this Ur-astrology is also concerned with biological functions is one of themissing links in the Lovecraftian ouevre. He hints at it, talks around it with hisreferences to “orgies” and his discussion of poor Lavinia Whately and her demonicoffspring. When the stars are right, it's not only the time when Cthulhu can be rousedfrom his subterranean slumber but it's also the time when 35-year-old albino women"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"can be impregnated by invisible alien monsters as long as the correct rituals areperformed. An essential aspect of the Cthulhu Mythos is that a knowledeable cult ofexperienced sorcerers are indispensable to the opening (and especially the closing) ofthe Gate.

She conceived during a ritualthat enabled her father, old Wizard Whateley, to charge the essences (the kalas)appropriately so that—as the Gate opened at the proper time—Lavinia's ovum wouldhave been subtly altered to enable the alien seed to take root.138None of this is described as such in “The Dunwich Horror,” of course. It takes alittle reading between the lines. Knowing what we know now of how these TyphonianTeratomas are created it is a simple task to go back and re-read Lovecraft with greaterunderstanding of the process and of what was said and most important what was notsaid or described, but implied. That human sexuality is a means of breaching theboundaries between this world and the next is a staple of Tantra. It was virtuallyunknown in the West until comparatively recently with the publication of sometranslated Tantric texts in the nineteenth century. But this was common knowledge tothe cultists around Cthulhu in Lovecraft's stories.Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the keyand guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. Heknows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall breakthrough again. He knows where They have trod earth's fields, and where Theystill tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread.—H. P. Lovecraft, “The Dunwich Horror”It was Yog-Sothoth who impregnated Lavinia Whateley, who then gave birth toWilbur Whateley and his monstrous, unnamed twin brother. Yog-Sothoth as the Gate isthus perfectly understandable in the context we have been examining. It is through thisunnatural intercourse and its subsequent conception that a Gate has been openedbetween this world and the next, and a Magical Child created who lives in both.Grant illuminates this concept when he writes of the assumption of god-forms, apractice that is essential to Thelemic ritual in general. His approach also helps us tounderstand the nature of Cthulhu, the octopus-headed beast of the statue we discover in“The Call of Cthulhu.”He writes:The magical theories which underlie the formula of the assumption of god-forms are of vital importance to an understanding of Crowley's later refinementand rehabilitation of them. The masquerading as animal-headed deities ... wasdone with intent to assimilate the superhuman powers possessed by certainanimals."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"This formula, which was used by sorcerers of the ancient world, had aprofound effect upon the psychology of the operator. Because man evolved fromthe beasts, he possesses—deeply buried in his subconscious—the memories ofsuperhuman powers he once possessed. ... Any required atavism could be evokedby assumption of the appropriate god-form. ... Crowley interprets the formula asa magical unification of larval consciousness, characteristic of pre-humanphases of life, with the ultimate product of an exalted and illumined human will... through the instrumentality of psycho-sexual magic. The Sphinx is the mostcelebrated image of this concept. ... the meeting of beast and god through themediumship of man.139In Lovecraft's stories, these are always considered hideous creations. The Old Onesare gods in their own right, otherwise why do they need a High Priest—Cthulhu—andbands of clandestine worshippers throughout the world to worship and summon them?The offspring of Lavinia Whately then is just such a “meeting of beast and god throughthe mediumship of man.” And, of course, it was accompanied by “psycho-sexual rites”performed by her wizard father on her tortured mind, her virgin flesh: the incestuouselement of the Star Sapphire ritual taken to its heinous, albeit logical, conclusion.The same process is used—can be used—for widely different ends and by operatorsof widely different capabilities; but it should be obvious that if such a thing as theSphinx (for instance) actually existed as a living thing, it would be shunned as anabomination, the ancient Egyptian version of a “Typhonian Teratoma.” Is Cthulhu,then, the product of just such a union? The “animal-headed” masks used by magiciansto connect to their atavisms represent stages of human evolution, as per Grant. If so,then the cephalopod-headed creature known as Cthulhu represents a much earlier stage,something predating the arrival of quadripeds and mammals in general. Cthulhurepresents that stage in evolution when life was still in its relative infancy: slime-dwelling, ooze-feasting creatures from the ocean's depths. To connect with Cthulhu,then, is to approach the oldest part of the human brain: the reptilian or serpent brain,sitting atop the spinal column, that controls basic “fight or flight” responses as well asritual, and which is in charge of our sexual responses as well. This has nothing to dowith the higher states of love and affection, or of romance and seduction. Rather, thisis pure reproductive imperative, pure lust, the seat of the “darkest” passions, those thatwe—as social beings—attempt (often vainly and with horrendous consequences) torepress, suppress, or flatly deny. It is the realm of what Swiss psychiatrist Carl G. Jungcalled “the Shadow,” an unconscious element of the personality that is linked to thesame animal instincts we have described,140 and which is the repository of a person'sdarkest desires as well as the source of human creativity141.If that abyss and what it held were real, there is no hope. Then, all too truly,there lies upon this world of man a mocking and incredible shadow out of"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"time.142It is unnameable, by virtue of the fact that this area of human consciousness existedbefore there were “individuals”: it is the aspect of consciousness that becomes mostpronounced in mob violence, gang rape, and mass hysteria.Violence carried to the pitch of frenzy, either masochistic or the reverse. Thisunseals primal atavisms, the resurgence of which leads directly to the mostancient (i.e. the original) state of consciousness which, being pure, is cosmic,unlimited.143It is the basic building block of survival (fight or flight) and as such it existed beforethe ego, before the super-ego, before humans became conscious of themselves asseparate, individual entities with their own souls, their own spirituality, their ownpotentialities as kings and queens. The physical aspect of the Shadow—the reptilianbrain—is believed to be at least 500 million years old144: certainly a Lovecraftian timespan.145 There is nothing thoughtful or intellectual about this characteristic. There isno reasoning with it. There can only be control ... or lack of control. And since logicand reason have no place in the “serpent brain,” until the advent of depth psychologythe only means available for controlling its desires and managing its appetites (otherthan prison or drugs) were in the realm of ritual in which these unholy or unlawfulneeds found a safe and manageable channel for expression. Otherwise the world wouldhave long since been filled with Typhonian Teratomas as inbreeding and incest wouldhave degenerated the gene pool and resulted in widespread physical and mentaldeformities.This part of the brain also controls the autonomic functions, such as heart-rate,breath-rate, peristalis, etc. which are not normally controlled by the conscious mindbut which occur automatically, even while we sleep. It is the target of such practices asyoga and Chinese alchemy which seek to exert control over the unconscious mindthrough manipulation of the autonomic functions. Thus pranayama—one of Crowley'srequired practices—is the conscious control of breathing, which in turn is the gatewayto conscious control of the heart-beat and from there to all the other autonomicfunctions. It is, of course, an extremely dangerous practice for those who have not beeninitiated into its secrets by someone who knows what they are doing.The Necronomicon Gnosis involves the deliberate investigation of this dark realm inits entirety, the realm where death and sexuality (the Freudian “death instinct” and“pleasure principle”) are so inextricably intertwined that it is impossible (from theoutside) to tell them apart, but which provides the engine for all successful Thelemicritual. For Thelema is a doctrine that rejects repression in all its forms and providesoutlets—some socially-acceptable, some not—for the exploration and expression ofthis “dark matter.”"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"It should be emphasized, however, that Thelema does not provide an excuse forindulging in these antinomian practices willy-nilly, like some kind of occult-orientedswingers club. The only way in which to (productively) access this darker realm, the“Nightside” of Eden, is through the exercise of the Will. The individual—the result ofmillenia of human evolution—must be in conscious control of its own serpent brain.This is the meeting of beast and god through the mediumship of man spoken of above,the antipodes of human consciousness. The purpose is to assimilate the darker andforbidden aspects of one's consciousness into the higher form of experience, ofevolution, so that it may serve as the power-house for greater attainments. In order todo this, the rituals themselves must be accurately timed. There is no better method ofcontrolling the darker impulses than by refusing to allow them expression until “thestars are right.”"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"When the Stars are RightThe Pennacook myths, which were the most consistent and picturesque, taughtthat the Winged Ones came from the Great Bear in the sky, and had mines in ourearthly hills whence they took a kind of stone they could not get on any otherworld. They did not live here, said the myths, but merely maintained outpostsand flew back with vast cargoes of stone to their own stars in the north.—H. P. Lovecraft146One of the critical pieces of information concerning the correct position of the“stars”—i.e., when they are “right”—has to do with the Great Bear constellation,referenced above in Lovecraft's story “The Whisperer in the Darkness.” A further noteis at the end of that same paragraph when “their own stars in the north” are referenced.Simon has made much of this in his Gates of the Necronomicon, and I have focused onthe Great Bear constellation myself in Stairway to Heaven in an attempt todemonstrate its universality among mystery cults in different parts of the world,including shamanism, Mithraism and even some ceremonial forms of Daoism. Ibelieve that this constellation is a key to understanding the ancient cults of whichLovecraft writes and in this it seems Kenneth Grant concurs.All Circle-craft is based either upon the original (stellar) circle of the GreatBear, Goddess of the Seven Stars; or the Moon and her thirteenfold annualcycle; or on the later and final solar circle of the Twelve Celestial houses of thesun (zodiac).147The Great Bear is a circumpolar constellation: that is, it never sets below thehorizon but rotates endlessly about a point in the absolute north above the earth,represented in our time by the Pole Star. In other words, these are the “stars in thenorth” to which Lovecraft alludes in his story. Navigators have used the position of theGreat Bear constellation—or its smaller asterism, the Big Dipper—to tell time anddirection when no landmarks or other astronomical phenomena are available or visible,such as in the middle of the ocean at night. Remembering how critical time and themeasurement of time is to the correct performance of rituals intended to evokeplanetary and other forces, we can begin to appreciate the relevance of thisconstellation to mystery religions the world over. Grant associates the Great Bear withthe Goddess of the Seven Stars, i.e. with Babalon herself. In the Schlangekraftrecension of the Necronomicon, it specifically states that the Gate may be openedwhen “the Great Bear hangs from its tail in the sky.” Of course, the Great Bear hangsfrom its tail in the sky once every day as it rotates around the Pole Star (it is actuallythe earth doing the rotating, as every schoolchild knows). But at night, when theconstellation may be visible, it hangs from its tail (making a straight line from the Pole"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Star) at midnight on April 30.148 As we have noted before, this is a date with greatrelevance, for it is another of the cross-quarter days mentioned above.

The European equivalent of theAmerican Halloween, it is a day when witches gather for their Great Sabbat atopmountain peaks and commune with the Devil ... with the Dark Lord.It also has some uncanny correspondences with American and world history. Forinstance, April 30, 1492 was the day Christopher Columbus received his commissionto set sail for the East Indies, a voyage that culminated in the “discovery” of Americaon October 12, 1492—coincidentally Aleister Crowley's birthday.April 30, 1789 was the day George Washington took the oath of office of Presidentof the United States, on Wall Street in New York City. The monument that bears hisname in Washington, D.C. is precisely 555 feet high: 555 is the number of the wordNecro-nomicon.April 30, 1945 is the day when it was alleged that Adolf Hitler committed suicide inthe Berlin bunker.April 30, 1975 is the day when Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese army, signallingthe end of the Vietnam War.April 30, 1978 is the day the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan was proclaimed,with disastrous consequences.And on and on.Into the north window of my chamber glows the Pole Star with uncanny light ...The Pole Star, evil and monstrous, leers down from the black vault, winkinghideously like an insane watching eye which strives to convey some strangemessage, yet recalls nothing save that it once had a message to convey.—H. P. Lovecraft, “Polaris” (1918)Lovecraft's conscious employment of the Great Bear and Polaris in his stories maybe an indication that he was aware of the role these astronomical entities play in thecults he describes with such terror. Frater Achad—whose strange insistence on acontemporaneous Aeon of Maat we have already described—had this to say about thesame constellation:The first boy and his mother were called Sut-Typhon.Sut means “The Opener,” and this may be taken in the physiological as well asthe astrological sense. The Child was the opener in the sense of being born ofthe un-mated Mother. The Sun is the Opener of the Day, while Sut as the Star-god was considered the Opener of the Year with the rising of Sothis, and on hisrising was the Great Bear cycle founded.149"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"While Achad links the Great Bear with Set in his writings, Grant does the same inthe Typhonian trilogies:Celestial, not terrestrial, lineage was the matter of contention. In the course ofages, the ancestors of the Terrestrial Typhonians came to be typified by theGreat Bear constellation connected with vastly ancient myths inspired by dimmemories of the earliest colonisers of earth, and descended from Typhonian starsystems.150Thus we can see that Grant believes that the earliest colonizers of earth came from aregion we identify with the Great Bear constellation which is consistent with theLovecraft short story referenced above, “The Whisperer in the Darkness,” in whichalien beings from the Great Bear constellation began coming to earth in aeons past andconcerned themselves with mining a specific ore from our planet. Grant is referring inthis work to the idea that the type of “lineage” typified by such popular authors as DanBrown in his DaVinci Code and in other works—fiction and non-fiction—that havecome out of the Holy Blood, Holy Grail genre does not refer to an earthly bloodline butto a celestial one (not necessarily a “heavenly” or “divine” bloodline, but one thatcomes from off-planet). This is a type of lineage that transcends genetics as weunderstand it and manifests as occult currents through the ages, much in the way thatapostolic succession is a “lineage” within the Catholic and Orthodox churches exceptthat, in this case, the lineage to which Grant refers has its origins not on earth or withinearthly organizations but in the stars. It is this type of lineage that makes itself knownin the works of both Crowley and Lovecraft as we have seen: works produced by thesetwo men, unknown to each other, yet displaying an uncanny pattern of coincidence andagreement. It is what prompted Grant to speak of a Thelemic current as well as aNecronomicon and an Egyptian current, and to identify them as three separate strandsof the same lineage.The Lovecraftian idea that these ancient, extraterrestrial beings came to the earth inorder to mine a specific stone has deep resonance with a whole host of conceptsconnected with alchemy, sexuality, and Tantra, and it is a theme that Lovecraft hasexplored in more than one short story.Aside from the oeuvre published under his own name, Love-craft is known to havehelped other authors with their stories, in some cases rewriting them entirely butpermitting them to be published as original works by the same authors. One particularstory reinforces the Grant thesis that Crowley's mysterious “Tulu” and Lovecraft'sCthulhu are one and the same.This is the story entitled “The Mound” and attributed as the work of Zealia Bishop.It was written in the period 1929-1930 and appears in the collection of Lovecraft's“other” works, The Horror in the Museum, edited by Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi. Inthis story we have references to “ingots of magnetic Tulu-metal”151 and the “sacred"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"and magnetic Tulu-metal.”152 This story also has a reference to a sunken city, referredto in a Mexican dialect as Relex. Anyone familiar with how the Spanish “x” ispronounced will immediately realize that this word is pronounced “Rel-eh” with a hard“h,” thus giving us a form of R'lyeh.In this story we have again the theme of mining specific metals, in this case Tulumetal, which is magnetic and therefore of a north-south polarity consistent with theNecronomicon Gnosis and its emphasis on the north-south axis versus the solar east-west axis. It should be pointed out once again that the word “Tulu” is specific to bothLovecraft and to Crowley: it is a point of tangence between the two authors thatreflects a deeper connection than we normally attribute to the horror writer and theprophet of the New Age.Mircea Eliade, the famous historian of religion at the University of Chicago, wroteconcerning sacred stones in his The Forge and the Crucible:It is not very long since the kings of Malaya kept a sacred block of iron whichwas part of their regalia and surrounded it with an extraordinary venerationmingled with superstitious terror. ...It was not a question of fetishism or of theworship of an object in itself or for its own sake; it was not a matter ofsuperstition but a sacred respect for a strange object outside their own familiarworld, an object coming from elsewhere and hence a sign or token of the‘beyond,’ a near-image of the transcendental.153Eliade equates the practice of mining with a whole host of concepts related toalchemical transformation. The miner was an initiate of the dark mysteries: byworking in the caves and hidden places of the earth he was in constant contact with thespirits that dwelled in the underworld. He was also privvy to the secret processeswhereby a stone could become gold. He knew where objects were buried and hidden.His day turned into night as he descended into the bowels of the earth, below anyvisible horizon and thus out of reach of the sun and the stars.The cult of Mithra conducted its mysterious initiations in caves, in the place ofmines and buried treasure, away from the light of the sun. For this reason (and severalothers), I believe that the Mithraists were not worshipping the Sun god and that thesacred Bull that was slain by Mithra was not an emblem of the zodiacal sign Taurusbut of the constellation known as the Great Bear. I develop this theory more carefullyin Stairway to Heaven, but basically I identify nocturnal worship with stellar worship,especially in the case of cults and religions that had no other reason to meet in secretsince they were not being suppressed or engaging in antinomian practices.There was an ancient understanding that there was an analogue between the bowelsof the earth and the embryonic stages of gestation. The earth gave birth to gold andother precious metals through a long process of metallurgical gestation. The alchemistunderstood these processes and knew how to hurry them along, to “induce labor” one"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"might say so that the earth gave up its treasures more quickly. The natural process ofhuman evolution may, one day, result in a being of higher intelligence and spiritualillumination; but it is the work of the magician to “induce labor” in the initiate, tohurry along the natural process of spiritual evolution so that it takes place (at least forthe individual) in a single lifetime.This has relevance for the discussion of the reptilian brain, above; for just as humanbeings evolved over the long term from watery creatures to amphibious mammals tomammals and finally to homo sapiens, so the human embryo goes through a similarprocess of living in an aqueous solution until it “crawls out onto dry land,” i.e., is borninto the world as an air-breathing creature, crawling on all fours and eventuallywalking upright. In this sense, every magician and every alchemist is an embryo goingthrough the same process as the human embryo, as the metals in the earth, as the entirehuman race itself. But it must begin by probing the reptilian brain and discovering itscontents and neutralizing them, making them servants of the Will. And what betterrepresentative of the reptilian brain and the danger and loathesomeness that it concealsthan the hideous form of the High Priest of the Great Old Ones, Cthulhu himself?The Necronomicon Gnosis recognizes that some of the steps along the way wereevolutionary dead-ends, at least from the point of view of homo sapiens. While somecreatures did not survive and became extinct on our world, the Gnosis insists that notall of them died out permanently but that their scars remain on our DNA, dormant,“dead but dreaming” of the day when they will be “turned on” by environmental orother factors and rise with a roar from the bowels of our own, individual R'lyehs."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Sunken CityIn his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.—H. P. LovecraftUntil you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you willcall it fate.—C. G. JungLovecraft's core story, “The Call of Cthulhu,” is the repository of all the basicthemes and motifs that appear in his later tales. It reflects his basic preoccupationswith ancient races, mysterious cults, non-Euclidean geometry, and the power ofdreams. It also introduces us to Cthulhu, the high priest of the Great Old Ones, and thesunken city of R'lyeh where Cthulhu lies dead, but dreaming.The idea of a sunken or buried civilization is something that has been with us forthousands of years. Plato famously referred to the vanished civilization of Atlantis;and rumors of a Lemuria and a Mu—more sunken civilizations—became prevalent inthe late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Then there was the Hollow Earththeory and the claim that Admiral Byrd had seen the entrance to this “inner earth”through a hole in the vicinity of the North Pole. So the sunken city meme has been astaple of fantasy history for quite some time.Lovecraft's genius lay in reinterpreting these stories from a darker point of view.Lovecraft's sunken city of R'lyeh is where the Great Old Ones were defeated by somequirk of space or time, and where Cthulhu lies buried in his house-like tomb beneaththe waves. This ancient city is older than Atlantis or any of its other mythicalcounterparts. It was built—using geometry that was all “wrong”—by the race from thestars, a race that used to own the planet Earth in aeons past and which is on the vergeof returning when the “stars are right.”If we analyze this story from the point of view of depth psychology, we can see acertain level of consistency with modern ideas concerning the unconscious and thedanger of repressing unconscious feelings and especially the knowledge that liesburied in the deep, forgotten corners of the human mind. In this approach, R'lyehbecomes the unconscious itself, and Cthulhu is the Shadow that waits to be discovered:the potentially dangerous, violent, evil aspect of human nature. An aspect thatcommunicates with us the same way Cthulhu communicates with his followers: indreams.Freud famously claimed that dreams were the “royal road to the unconscious,” andLovecraft might have agreed. To the gothic horror writer, dreams were certainly theroyal road to R'lyeh, to the dead but dreaming High Priest, Cthulhu. He writes thatCthulhu is in communication with his human followers through a kind of telepathy that"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"manifests in their dreams. This is what triggered the creation of the Cthulhu sculptureby young Wilcox and which sets in motion “The Call of Cthulhu.” We learn that this“call” is indeed the dream-stream sent by Cthulhu from deep within the sunken city,from deep within what Jung called the “collective unconscious.”It may be a truism that what demands to be known in our dreams is not somebeautiful image of heaven or some pleasing, loving memory—but something moresinister, something uglier that needed to be “put down,” that needed to be suppressedin order that the rest of the personality could survive in the real world. The onlypersons who deliberately evoked those nightmares to visible appearance were themystics, the magicians, and the shamans. I have written at some length in other worksabout the shamanistic initiations, and of course Mircea Eliade has discussed this atsome length in his seminal work on the subject, Shamanism. This type of initiationinvolves a direct confrontation with the suppressed psychic material that involves thedeath, dismemberment, and re-integration of the individual psyche. For someone whohas come through this type of experience the dread Cthulhu could hold no fears.It may also be a truism that this suppressed material is connected with sexual issues.It may involve sexual trauma of the individual at a very young age, or physical oremotional abuse of some kind by an older person. While the exact identity and natureof the trauma will be different from person to person, the Minotaur in the Labyrinth isthe same: the different types of abuse reflect different pathways in the Labyrinth, butthey all lead to the same Monster at the center. Lovecraft called this Monster by aname he heard or invented or dreamed: Cthulhu.As described in the Schlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon, the ancientSumerians had just such a sunken city in their myth cycles. The gate to this underworldpalace was through the city of Gudua, the city that became Cutha and Kutu. Cthulhu isKutu-lu, the Man of the Underworld. He is a hybrid creature, as envisioned byLovecraft, something crustacean or squid-like. As a High Priest of the Old Ones, he isthe liminal figure between humanity and the ancient race from the stars. He lives in theUnderworld, in R'lyeh, and can be summoned by those who hear his call through theirfevered dreams.In “The Call of Cthulhu” Lovecraft reveals that the rituals required to summon theGreat Old Ones involve orgies by people who are of mixed races, the implication beingthat they are not white Europeans but Arabs, Africans, and Asians ... all races of whichLovecraft was deeply suspicious and fearful. This conflation of unbridled sexuality andexotic races and ethnicities is a common theme in colonialist literature and was afeature in the castigation of the practice of Tantra in India by the British colonizers.Again, Lovecraft has touched on a deep current of occult tradition and methodology inhis fantasies, understanding that contact may be made with the darker aspects of thehuman mind through avenues provided by sexuality. He was not alone in this, ofcourse. The French Decadent poets and authors also made that connection, and the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"stories of the Black Mass with its worship of Satan combined with sexual orgies arerepresentative of this idea. It was Lovecraft, however, who extended this concept evenfurther by associating the sexual orgies with the worship—not of Satan, or of anyhuman-created or human-inspired boogeyman—but of the most ancient, primordialand non-human race that once controlled the planet and which was on the verge ofreturning again to reclaim it. Lovecraft wanted to go deeper, darker, into moredangerous territory. He understood that there were levels to human consciousness thatcould not be plumbed by spiritual dilettantes, and that the rituals employed bysorcerers and magicians had implications far beyond what these individuals believed tobe possible ... or desirable. To evoke Cthulhu or any of the Great Old Ones was toinvite disaster (from the original meaning of the word, dis-aster or “evil star”) anddestruction for the entire planet. It was to cause a mental or nervous breakdown for theentire human race.At the center of this complex of ideas rests the unholy book itself, theNecronomicon. To Lovecraft, this book contains the spells used by members of theCthulhu cult and instructions on how to keep the Gate between Us and Them—theultimate “liminality”—closed forever. The spells are in a language that is unknown,containing diagrams that seem meaningless yet somehow unnerving in their weirdgeometry. It is a repository of bits and pieces of ancient knowledge—like our dreams,like our own unconscious—and to read it is to become entranced, to enter a dream statewhile awake, to fear oneself going insane. It is a book of Death, as its name implies, acollection of antique ceremonies and smatterings of images from our collective past. Itoffers a symbol set that speaks directly to the unconscious, to Cthulhu, in the languageCthulhu uses for communicating to us in our dreams. Instead of Freud's famousInterpretation of Dreams it is a book of dreams that interprets us. It is our collectivedreamworld as humans, fragmentary and filled with lacunae as it may be, a satanicsemiotics that offers a two-lane pathway to our darkest memories as a race of humansand of our contact—at some distant, immemorial past—with another race of being, acontact that was perhaps not quite so pleasant as we may wish to believe. It enables usto interpret and decipher our dreams (the messages from Cthulhu) but also provides ameans for communicating back. As Grant understood, the Necronomicon is also amanual not only of dream interpretation (a la Freud) but of dream control.It's how we communicate with the denizens of the sunken city, whether we call itR'lyeh or the collective unconscious. And it uses the fiber optic cable of the serpentbrain to transfer its bits and ... “bites.”128 H.P. Lovecraft, “Supernatural Horror in Literature”129 H.P.

The intense magical operations whichCrowley performed (especially those which occurred between 1920 and 1924)could, and probably did, engender strange and “unearthly” children.156THE SUBJECT OF THIS CHAPTER concerns the most controversial and perhaps mosttitillating aspect of the Grant ouevre: his focus on sexuality within the context ofmagic. We have touched on it briefly here and there in the pages that precede this one,but the author would like to dwell a bit more deeply on this issue since it is so criticaltowards an understanding of Grant's Typhonian Tradition and many readers possiblywould find it difficult to reconcile such material with Lovecraft's known reluctance todiscuss sexuality at all in his own work.In order to do justice to this difficult subject, we will be reverting from time to timeto Gnostic texts and interpretations since it may come as a surprise to some readersthat the early Gnostics were very concerned with human sexuality and its place in theuniverse. There were probably as many different versions of “spiritual sexuality”among the Gnostics as there were Gnostic sects. Our sources for this material areunfortunately restricted to Christian commentators who were notoriously hostile toGnosticism and whose data is thus suspect, as well as the surviving Gnostic fragmentsthemselves such as the Nag Hammadi scrolls. What we will find in this discussion is ajustification for much of what passes for “sacred sexuality” in the Thelemic"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"framework, but also an elaboration of Lovecraft's own fears—perhaps unconscious—concerning the potential disasters of “liberated” sexuality and especially of intercourse—carnal and otherwise—with discarnate entities, gods, demons, and ... others.We will also have recourse to Tantra, as Grant relies more heavily on Tantra than onGnosticism for an understanding of the inner workings of magic and the relevance ofsexual practices to Thelema. Like the Gnostics before them, Thelemites are concernedwith sexuality as a form of worship and/or magical power. In this they are no differentfrom the Tantrikas of India, Nepal and Tibet and indeed they share many ideas andconcepts in common. To Grant, this was a genuine revelation and he saw a broadercontext for Thelema in the occult practices of Asia and Africa as well as within theframework of the Necronomicon Gnosis which is not bashful about confronting thenastier bits of occult praxis."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Celibate and the HedonistOne of the antipodes in this study concerns the weird polarity of H. P. Lovecraft andAleister Crowley. The former was notoriously sexually ambivalent, virtually asexual.He lived most of his life as a celibate, married for only two years and even then did notlive with his wife for much of that time. The latter was notorious in an entirelydifferent way: Crowley had sex with anyone and it seems anything within reach. Maleor female, young or old, of whatever race, whatever degree of physical health or actualphysical deformity (like poor Lavinia Whateley, above, who would have made aperfect partner for the English magician, but who had to settle for her “half-insane”wizard of a father).Their approach to magic was similarly opposite. Crowley enthusiastically engagedin sexual magic for the purpose of creating spiritual offspring who would carry out hisvarious tasks. Lovecraft found such behavior revolting, but in his stories there is a tacitacknowledgement that the system worked, just not in the way Crowley would haveanticipated. To Lovecraft, human sexual intercourse with gods, aliens, demons, etc.could only result in hideous monsters out to destroy all of humanity. To Crowley, suchintercourse would produce servants who would be more capable than the humanversion, “You can't get good help nowadays” being the operative principle.In Lovecraft's stories there are no “good” magicians except for those who becomebattlefield trained in order to undo some other magician's work, to close the Gate andto send Wilbur Whateley's twin back to where it came, etc. To Lovecraft the person,magic was superstition and at least one cause of humanity's distress, so his positionwas relatively consistent: no matter how you looked at it, either as a believer or as anatheist, magic was bad. At best it was a waste of time, at worst it was an unholypractice designed to enslave humanity.Thus, in Lovecraft and Crowley we have two oppposing points of view and two verydifferent personalities. We especially have two very different approaches to sexuality,as well. Then how were these two men somehow “picking up” some identicalinformation?We can say that Lovecraft was a natural sensitive—as are many true artists—andthat regardless of his ideology he was nevertheless in tune with the occult currents ofthe day. In this he was different from Crowley in that Crowley's art was always inservice to his ideology; his novels are occult romans-a-clef his poetry is designed to beused as keys to his magical worldview. Crowley used his novel Moonchild to attackand ridicule those he despised, such as Arthur Edward Waite and MacGregor Mathers.Lovecraft used his stories to praise and recognize his friends, such as Clark AshtonSmith.In fact, Lovecraft had friends: a wide circle of friends with whom he pretty muchstayed in contact for most of his life, usually through his voluminous correspondence"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"but also in visits out of the State of Rhode Island where he lived to New York City,Florida, and other parts of the country. Crowley, on the other hand, alienated many ofhis friends over time and those who stuck by him were few and far between. It's hard tobe chummy with the Prophet of a New Age.So for all of Lovecraft's sexual timidity he had more consistent social contacts thanthe man who would engage in any form of sexual intercourse with just about anyone.They were opposite poles, indeed, and their common interests kept them on the sameaxis. Both Lovecraft and Crowley wrote of contact with extra-mundane forces, ofancient races, lost temples, bizarre occult practices, and strange, devil-worshippingcults. It is in the tension between their two, diametrically-opposed, points of view thatwe find the most valuable information and inspired insights.Lovecraft's most notable discussion of how magic might be used to create hideousbeings when coupled with sexual practices is in his famous short story “The DunwichHorror” which was made into a film back in 1970. It concerns the “half-insane” oldwizard Whateley and the unnameable rites he performed on his deformed, albinodaughter Lavinia. There were two genetic Whateley lines, the decayed and theundecayed lines according to Lovecraft and, of course, Old Whateley belonged to thedecayed line. Thus there was the implication that this particular genetic strain wasalready tainted and the pattern of abnormal births was an indication either thatsomething was amiss with the wizardry since long ago, or that the geneticabnormalities were somehow necessary to the effectiveness of the rites.Wanted: Dwarfs, Hunchbacks, Tattooed Women, Harrison Fisher Girls, Freaksof all sorts, Coloured women, only if exceptionally ugly or deformed, to posefor artist. Apply by letter with a photograph.157Crowley was not averse to having sexual relations with women of different racialand ethnic backgrounds, as well as with women who were physically different in someobvious way. He was also not averse to having homosexual relations, and often as the“bottom” or receiving partner in acts of anal sex. There is no indication that Crowleyreceived much in the way of sexual satisfaction from these acts, and his Confessionsand other writings tend to support the view that he approached virtually all sexualityfrom a magical standpoint which was inextricable from a psychological one. As it isalmost certain that Lovecraft did not enjoy sexuality (at least, not enough to seek outsexual opportunities with any degree of passion or determination) we might say thatthese two men shared a common approach. Neither Crowley nor Lovecraft engaged insexual activity with the primary intention of obtaining sexual satisfaction orgratification. For Crowley, sexual activity was subordinate to the demands of the GreatWork: it was ritual and a pragmatic utilization of his psycho-biological apparatus, amethod to be used to plumb the depths of his psyche as well as to make contact withother forces in the universe. For Lovecraft it just wasn't an issue at all. For both men, it"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"could be claimed that sexuality was not about physical satisfaction or even need. It wasabout something else entirely."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Hideous MarriageThe conflicts now raging in the world are due to the birth-pangs of the Aeon ofHorus. Sexual methods of establishing contact with entities more evolved thanman will be perfected and there are already signs of their development.158As mentioned previously, there are several similarities that can be noted betweenthe sexual mysticism of Thelema and the Gnostic conception of sexuality and marriageas represented by the Valentinians. We have already seen that the Aeons of ValentinianGnosticism have their parallels to the Thelemic Aeons. In the case of human sexuality,there are even deeper connections and they can be used as a prism through which tounderstand Grant's preoccupation with Tantra as a means of reinterpreting Thelemicmagic.The Christian commentator Clement of Alexandria (c. 150-c. 215 CE) wroteextensively on Gnosticism in order to refute it. The Valentinians, alone among thevarious Gnostic sects, attract his approval because of their positive view towardsmarriage as the attempt to bring down the divine emanations. The Valentinians—according to Clement—saw human marriage as the earthly representation of thesyzygies: the male-female pairs that were the first emanations of the Father and whicheventually resulted in the Creation as we know it.But some of Clement's objections to other Gnostic groups are very revealing.Clement contrasts the Valentinians with the Carpocrations, who he thinksparticipated in licentious sexual acts because they believed that by doing so theywere imitating the primordial powers who had intercourse with one another inorder to create the universe.159This is as good a brief explanation of Tantra as any.Instead, as Gnostic scholar April D. DeConick tells us, Clement was interested in aspecific form of human sexual expression that would result in divine offspring:Human marriage was procreative, but one form of it produced more perfectoffspring than the other. The higher form of marriage included some sort ofconsciousness-raising during sexual relations to insure that the children wouldresemble God. Physical intercourse was not driven by lust, but was a matter ofthe will or intention.160In other words, the Crowleyan imperative “love under will.” To make this pointmore precisely, Clement writes that Christians should:... do nothing from lust (epithumia). Our will is to be directed towards thatwhich is necessary. For we are children not of lust but of will (thelematos).161Thus, Clement of Alexandria insists that Christians are children of Thelema!"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"According to Clement, human sexual intercourse that was not directed towards thedivine—sexual relations that were the result of the lustful feelings of the partners—produced “defective” offspring.162 Lovecraft would take this idea much further, for heraises the possibility of sexual relations between humans and non-human creatures thatresult in “defective” offspring, to say the least. Lovecraft also identifies what he seesas defective races, ethnicities and bloodlines representing genetic groups that are moreprone to worship or summon the dark forces from beyond the stars. This is obvious insuch stories as “The Horror At Red Hook,” and “The Dunwich Horror,” and certainly isimplied in “The Call of Cthulhu.”But the Valentinian Gnostics—according to Clement and amplified by DeConick—believed in spiritual intercourse:Through contemplative sexual practices, the Valentinians hoped to conceivechildren whose souls would contain an elect or morally-inclined “seed” of theSpirit. Sacred marriage was essential for giving birth to such children, who inturn would bring about the redemption of the fallen Sophia and the psyche.163This belief is quite similar to that of the Kabbalists of the Middle Ages who heldthat it was the duty of pious Jews to engage in sexual intercourse on the Sabbath inorder to help the “shards”—the broken pieces of the sephirot, the result of an oddly-failed attempt at the Creation—reunite and redeem themselves and by extension thewhole world so that the Shekinah herself can reunite with her Bridegroom. Theseshards are known as the qlippot, and Crowley devoted one rather strange document totheir study, Liber 231. It attracted the attention of Kenneth Grant in the TyphonianTrilogies because it seemed to offer a kind of blueprint to the Tunnels of Set: thedarkside of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life and the pathways that connect its variouspower zones, a subject to which we will return in the next chapter.While sacred marriage is a staple of alchemical literature and appears in thetheological adumbrations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints(Mormons), it is not as emphasized in traditional ceremonial magic. The iconic figureof the ceremonial magician is of a man who either works alone, or with several (male)assistants. This is evidenced by the grimoires themselves, which contain formulas forevoking the right spirits or demons to make a woman fall in love, or to seduce awoman, etc.—thus leading one to speculate that the average ceremonial magician wasprobably the medieval version of a geek: lacking in social graces and silently lustingafter the girl next door. Probably the best example of this meme is that of Goethe'sFaust the magician who similarly lusts after a woman, the beloved Gretchen, and whouses the Devil's powers to obtain her.This was not Crowley's problem, obviously. By the time Crowley had appeared onthe scene the field of ceremonial magic had undergone quite an overhaul. Beginningwith the romantic notions of Eliphas Levi and extending to the Golden Dawn, magic"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"was being redefined as a spiritual practice equivalent to a Western version of yoga andTantra, with a complex and internally-consistent worldview. Crowley extended thisimpulse to make of magic an all-encompassing spiritual movement, fueled by therevelations contained in the Book of the Law.In addition, such intellectual luminaries as Carl G. Jung would elevate the study ofalchemy to a serious field of psychological importance, and Gershom Scholem wouldbring Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism into the mainstream of academic research andanalysis. Mircea Eliade introduced the world to shamanism, and his brilliant studentIoan Couliano would focus his knowledge of many languages both ancient and modernon medieval spiritual texts and ascent literature. The influence of these academicwriters on the field of magic cannot be over-emphasized, even as they criticized occultauthors such as A. E. Waite and Aleister Crowley by name.164The theory and practice of magic was undergoing a sea-change, buffeted by forcesboth within and without, a process that continues to this day (especially with theoutstanding work on Western esotericism coming out of the Amsterdam school led byWouter Hanegraaf, and that of the late and much-lamented Nicholas Goodrick-Clarkeof England). But the aspect of modern magic that received the most attention—and themost confusion—was the constant references to sex as an element of the process. Thisbegan with Crowley, as far as can be determined.While the African-American mystic Paschal Beverly Randolph was undoubtedly amajor influence where the sexual aspect of occultism and spirituality was concerned,through his writings and his connections to the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light andeventually to the Ordo Templi Orientis, sacred sexuality was still very much a darklittle secret among the Western occultists until Crowley began publicizing it ratheropenly. The Golden Dawn had its rituals based on the Rosicrucian allegories, and usedboth male and female participants in its ceremonies (unusual for a secret society at thetime), but Crowley took the whole thing much further. As we have noted previously,the Golden Dawn provided much of the theoretical and ritual framework for Crowley'ssystem and, indeed, his AA is a refinement of the Golden Dawn degree structurewith the additional three degrees at the top of the Tree of Life. Thus it would seem thata mystique of sexuality had no real place in a system that was so perfectly symmetricalto begin with but the OTO changed all of that for Crowley.There is no doubt that the Book of the Law contains many passionate verses andlusty exhortations, written long before Crowley made the acquaintance of the OTO.This rather startling text might have made Crowley more receptive to the laterinstructions on sexual magic received from that German order. However Crowley'sapproach was not informed by a specific program of theory and practice; instead, hetried to incorporate sexual techniques within the context of the Golden Dawn system ofmagic he inherited and this was not always fruitful. He used various forms of sexualexperimentation for every kind of purpose, from charging talismans to attract money"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"or knowledge to using sexual intercourse to attain altered states of consciousness. Hewas aware that sexual fluids were important, but had to invent ways to use them.By the time he met David Curwen, who had considerably more knowledge in thisarea than he, Crowley was already quite old and only a few years from death. KennethGrant, however, did not let the opportunity pass to learn from someone moreknowledgeable in Tantra and began to understand the realm of possibilities that thisnew data represented. It is the combination of ceremonial magic, Crowley's ownThelemic denomination, Tantra, Afro-Caribbean magic, the art of Austin Osman Spareand the Surrealists, and the over-arching worldview of H. P. Lovecraft that informs theentire Typhonian Tradition. These quanta seem unrelated and arbitrarily chosen, but inGrant's hands they become indispensable elements of a symphony of occult praxis. Thedeeper one looks into any of these disparate traditions the more one finds importantcommonalities.The Valentinian Gnostics believed that they could create divine offspring throughsome process of “consciousness-raising” as DeConick puts it. Obviously the reversewould also be true: by a different form of “consciousness-raising” one could createdemon children. By fine-tuning the process, one could also create “offspring” thatwould have whatever characteristics were specified by the ritual. This means that theact of sexual intercourse would take place within a magical context. Clement ofAlexandria believed that sex acts that resulted from pure lust would produce childrenthat were somehow “defective”; how much more so children that were produced fromacts of sexual intercourse that were specifically designed to attract demonic orotherworldly forces.The Gnostic marriage was undoubtedly a spiritual one, the act of intercourseelevated to a higher plane; but it was nevertheless a ritual act. It was not motivated bypure lust or emotional or sexual attraction between partners. Oddly, this is the sameapproach that needs to be taken regardless of whether or not the purpose is to createdivine offspring or demonic ones: the concentration of the sexual partners must befocused on the spiritual or magical goal and not on the satisfaction of sexual desire.This is a requirement that effectively eliminates most dilettantes who become involvedin the practice of magic because they seek excitement or arcane thrills.The sexual rituals described by Grant in his Typhonian Trilogies are never explainedin full, but there is enough detail to enable the educated or dedicated reader to fill inthe blanks. The Gnostic Marriage example of a High Priest or King mating with a HighPriestess or Queen becomes the template onto which a series of variations is mapped.In order to deconstruct the Tantric rituals employed by Grant and by the members ofhis Nu-Isis Lodge it becomes necessary to deconstruct the sex act itself, to reduce it toits various psycho-biological components. The grosser physical aspects of the sex act—the bodily fluids especially—are understood to be place-holders for their moreethereal counterparts."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"None of this is helpful, however, if the individual participants are not themselvescompletely prepared for the ritual. This means that the operators must be demonstrablywell-trained in various yogic-type exercises, from pranayama and asana and the basicforms of yogic meditation up to and including the ability to raise Kundalini. While it isnot necessary for the participants to be adepts at Kundalini yoga, it is required thatthey have some basic ability in this regard otherwise the rituals are empty gestureswith no force behind them. The ability to meld mental concentration with physical,psycho-sexual response is the key towards successful completion of this type of ritual.It is a balancing act between the body's normal processes and reactions and theexertion of mental control over the same processes, made more difficult because thesame requirement is demanded of the partner. In the case of a male and femaleoperator both must be capable of at least the basic level of mental and physical control;it is not useful that only one member of the couple have this ability unless the goal ofthe ritual is to “vampirize” the power of the less-advanced partner.As mentioned earlier, one of the essential aspects of the type of training required forTantric-type operations is the ability to take conscious control of the autonomicnervous system, represented by the reptilian or serpent brain. In Tantric terms,however, this is considered raising the serpent from the base of the spine—the GoddessKundalini—until it reaches the brain where it meets the Lord Shiva and the alchemicalwedding or Gnostic marriage takes place. There are inherent dangers in this type ofpractice, whether you use Western or Asian terminology to describe it, and the imageof the serpent—one of the most venomous creatures on earth but also the one thatsheds its skin and becomes a symbol of transformation—is instructive in this regard. Itwas the serpent who told Eve to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree, to become “asgods.” Yet it was the Gnostics who believed that the serpent in the Garden of Eden wasactually the True God, and that the Creator of the world was a demi-urge, a lesserbeing who intended to enslave Adam and Eve for his own purposes. In this complicatedmixture of images and myths we can discern the outlines of sublime truths.Human sexuality has always been the touchstone for a whole host of tabus invirtually every culture. Society—whether as secular or sacred government or both—has arrogated to itself control over the sexual impulses of its members. Certain typesof sexual activity are approved, others are condemned. This is as true in preliteratesocieties as in literate and so-called “advanced” civilizations. As in all things, themagician takes back this control—albeit usually secretly—and denies himself orherself nothing in the pursuit of knowledge and personal perfection. In other words, inthis scenario, society becomes the demi-urge and the magician is Eve listening to theSerpent. If it is ever discovered that the magicians have listened to the Serpent, societywould banish them from its borders: arrested, imprisoned, burned at the stake orhanged. Traffic with the Devil—the Serpent, the Dark Lord—includes not only ritualsand beliefs that are contrary to that of the Church or State, but which also involves"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"sexual activity that has been proscribed. This is as true in medieval India with the riseof Tantric sects (in particular the Kaula circles and the practices of Vama Marg Tantra)as it was in the Europe of the Middle Ages.Control of the human body and its products—especially its offspring—has been afocus of modern societies. Sexuality that does not result in the conception of childrenoften has been banned, such as homosexuality, masturbation, sodomy, etc. Further, thechildren must be conceived within a legally-acceptable environment, i.e., the parentsof the children in question must be legally bound in the eyes of the State so that thechildren are legal inheritors of any property. Bloodlines and real estate are inextricablylinked in this way, and marriage is just a means of providing the right documentationto ensure a smooth transition from one property owner (the parent) to the next (thechild).In the degree structure of the OTO, however, sexual practices are given spiritualanalogues. It has been popularly—and somewhat erroneously—understood that theVIIIth degree of the OTO concerns auto-erotic practices (what the cynics refer to as“magical masturbation”), the IXth degree refers to heterosexual intercourse, and theXlth degree concerns homosexual intercourse. Thus the VIIIth degree and the XIthdegree would automatically be considered tabu by the established Church and State forthe reasons mentioned above. They represent the intentions of the magicians to ignorethe strictures of society in order to grasp more fully the potentiality of sexuality ingeneral, and to extend the knowledge and power of the individual magician through anunderstanding of the capabilities of the human body and the human psyche.The IXth degree represents more specifically what we have been referring to as theGnostic Marriage or the Alchemical Wedding. While it is nominally a degreeconcerned with heterosexual intercourse (if viewed purely clinically) it hasramifications far beyond what New Age Tantra practitioners would imagine.As Grant claims:The obloquy attached to the Yezidi as devil worshippers arose from the notionof congress between human and non-human entities; the angelic Being is theissue of a hideous marriage.165And not only among the Yezidi. The union of male and female Tantrikas in the ritesof the Kaula circle, for instance, is not a union of human partners. The union cannottake place until each of the two participants has become identified with a god andgoddess, respectively. That means that the individual male must be consciously unitedwith his deity, and at that point see the female partner as a goddess; the same is truefor the female partner who must be in the same state of exalted trance, identifyingherself with the deity perceived by the male and perceiving the male as a god. Thus thetwo individuals performing the maithuna—the sexual embrace, if the physical act isrequired by the ritual or by the guru in charge—are no longer human, and the “hideous"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"marriage” may result in angelic offspring.Ideas about the mating of humans with non-humans are quite ancient and we findexamples of this concept in Sumerian and Babylonian religion (specifically in the caseof the lillitu), in Greek and Roman mythology, and more recently in the fearsassociated with succubi and incubi in the Middle Ages. According to Saint ThomasAquinas in his Summa Theologica, succubi and incubi were male and female demonsrespectively (or a single, genderless demon who could take on either gender dependingon the circumstances), who stole semen from a sleeping male and then impregnated asleeping female with it. Nocturnal emissions were believed to be evidence of theactivities of the succubus; unmarried women who became pregnant were believed to bevictims of the incubus.Gods could also assume human or animal form and have sexual relations withhumans, as in the tales from Greek mythology involving Zeus and his manyincarnations for the purpose of seducing women. The offspring from these unions werealways remarkable, and became gods, goddesses and semi-divine beings in their ownright. All things being equal, it would be logical to assume that the offspring of anysuch union between human and non-human (whether divine or demonic or simplyextra-terrestrial) would be remarkable and would partake of characteristics of bothparents.Like Wilbur Whateley:The boy was not talkative, yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusiveelement wholly unpossessed by Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness didnot reside in what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemedvaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced thespoken sounds. ...

It was as if demons were associated with geneticabnormalities, evolutionary dead ends. But according to Grant—and, to a certainextent, Lovecraft—these “dead ends” are, like Cthulhu himself, merely dreaming.They represent sections of human DNA that have lain dormant for millions of years, nolonger required for human survival, but which may be switched on in the future as thehuman environment changes. They may be potentialities, which is why they have notdisappeared from the genetic code and are often overlooked as “junk” DNA, a"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"designation that has been challenged of late.

The beasts indicated, also, another line of evolution which did not haveits beginnings on earth.168It's necessary to understand Grant's insistence that the type of hideous creatures ofwhich Lovecraft writes so hauntingly only appear that way to the uninitiated “modern”eye. It follows that the methods employed to create these hybrids would also seem“monstrous” to modern eyes, involving non-traditional forms of sexual intercoursewith non-traditional sexual partners in non-traditional contexts.The practices assumed under the umbrella designation of Tantra represent much thatis non-traditional, and much that involves intercourse with non-human beings. I havewritten at length about Tantra elsewhere,169 but for now we can concentrate on thoserituals and concepts that preoccupy Grant in the Typhonian Trilogies, for these are therituals that have attracted so much interest and criticism.Throughout the Trilogies, Grant makes constant reference to Vama Marg or “lefthand” Tantric rituals, to the bodily fluids excreted by both the male and femalepractitioners, and to the importance of the menstrual cycle to the correct performanceof the rituals. He hints that these sexual rituals open gates to other dimensions, otherpathways on the Tree of Life. He also emphasizes the need for the participants to beadepts of a certain level: mastery of the practices required by Crowley in his AA isessential, such as pranayama and the other yogic techniques. Otherwise, instead of aritual capable of causing changes to occur in the environment of the ritual operators allthat is left is play-acting.Additionally, we may add the importance of timing.Traditionally, any type of ritual in Asian countries takes into account the calendarand the astrological conditions, Auspicious times are chosen for either the beginning ofa ritual or for the central act of the ritual. This is the same in Western traditions aswell, but the calendar used is normally an arbitrary one that does not take into"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"consideration actual astronomical conditions. At the very least, a lunar calendar isemployed by the type of Tantric cults of which Grant writes. As in the Necronomicon,stellar positioning is not a mere gesture but is critical to the success of the operation.This is not astrology per se; the heavens are a vast clockwork when viewed from theearth, and the planets have greater and lesser distances from the earth depending ontheir locations as seen against the backdrop of the Zodiac. The stars themselves riseand set at certain times and the circumpolar stars (which never rise or set) revolvearound the Pole Star and occupy different positions relative to an observer on the earthaccording to the day, hour and season. Sensitivity to these issues involves the magicianin the macrocosm: it forces the magician to be aware of his or her role and positionwithin the larger universe (a breathing and living organism from the point of view ofmagic, with obvious parallels and analogues to the human organism; to the Tantrika,the universe is the body of the Goddess). This sensitivity is translated back into themicrocosm as the ritual progresses, in accord with the ancient Hermetic axiom: “Asabove, so below.”As Grant writes:It is therefore possible to equate the force-fields (the Kundalini in the chakras)with planetary and stellar powers.... It is possible to draw off stellar ortransmundane energy by using the human organism as a condenser. This isachieved by tapping the appropriate power-zone, after Kundalini has animatedand magnetized it.170With this in mind, let us take a look at the form of the central rite in Grant's work."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Tantra in Theory and PracticeThe coven of thirteen represents the true chakra or Kaula Circle.171The Kaula Circle is legendary among afficionadoes of Tantric traditions. It is theone most referenced when the more exotic forms of Tantra are mentioned, such asworshipping in cemeteries or having ritual sexual intercourse in a group. In fact, theword kaula means a “group” or a “family” or a “clan,” and it refers to the group ofinitiates who are led by a guru or teacher. When Lovecraft writes about groups ofpeople having orgies in the swamps outside New Orleans as part of a religious ritual in“The Call of Cthulhu,” he could as easily have been referring to popular notionsconcerning the Kaulas.The approach of the Kaulas—and related Tantric groups such as the Nath Siddhis—towards the human body, sexuality, and even bodily excretions of all types is a positiveone: to the Kaula Tantrika, nothing is disgusting or obscene in-and-of-itself. It is thelevel of awareness in an unadvanced Tantrika that categorizes something as hideous orugly. In this type of Tantra, nothing can be considered filthy; it is only our attitudetowards certain objects or ideas that makes them seem filthy. Thus, nothing isforbidden: no action, no idea, no substance. However, that does not mean that theKaula initiate may act freely.The authority of a guru is necessary for the Kaula circle to function, for the guru hasthe technical knowledge as well as the experience and the discipline necessary to leadthe group. While nothing is ugly or forbidden among the Kaulas, the individualmembers must go through training and preparation before the most infamous of theTantric rituals—the pancatattva or ritual of the five substances—can be performed.The Pancatattva is also known as the “ritual of the five M's.” One important aspectof the rite is the breaking of the Vedic tabus, one by one, which involves eating anddrinking various forbidden substances (such as wine) which all begin with the letter“M” in Sanskrit, leading up to the fifth M which stands for maithuna or the “embrace,”a euphemism for sexual intercourse.The Kaula circle may have only one male-female couple engage in maithuna as partof the ritual: two people who have gone through sufficient initiations and ritualpreparation to enable them to embody the deities, Shiva and Shakti, or there may bemultiple couples depending on the circle and its guru. Shiva and Shakti are thearchetypal deities of Tantra, and there are Shiva Tantras and Shakti Tantras dependingon whether the focus is on the male aspect—Shiva—or the female aspect—Shakti.Shakti represents power, and the word is sometimes used as a synonym for thefeminine aspect of power such as when a particular god is said to “have his Shakti” oris “provided with his Shakti.” The female partner in a Kaula circle will representShakti just as the male will represent Shiva. Shiva could be said to represent potentialenergy and Shakti, kinetic energy or the energy of motion."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The Goddess Kundalini, said to reside at the base of the human spine, may also bereferred to as Shakti. When Kundalini is raised correctly it will reach the cranial vaultwhere Shiva is believed to reside in solitude. When Kundalini/Shakti meets Shiva inthis “chamber” they are said to be in marital embrace. This can be viewed as theTantric version of the Alchemical Wedding or the Gnostic Marriage. It even hasanalogues with the concept of the Shekinah reaching upwards from Malkuth to attainunion with the Divine in Kether and thus redeem all of Creation.But before Kundalini can reach her Beloved Shiva she must pass through sevengates or power-zones kmown as chakras, or wheels. (The Kaula Circle is called Kaulachakra.) These are found in the body, ranging from the base of the spine or themuladhara chakra, to the groin, the stomach, the heart, the neck, the head (at a spotbetween and behind the eyes) and finally to the last and seventh chakra which is the“thousand-petalled lotus” at the very top of the head which, when opened, rains downthe elixir of life—the amrita (a Sanskrit word that means “deathless”)—into the body.It would be a mistake to localize these chakras as actual bundles of nerves or otherphysical attributes, for they are believed to reside in the ethereal, or subtle, body. Ifone imagines there is a kind of electromagnetic field surrounding the body, then thechakras would be found there rather than in the body itself. However, the result ofawakening these chakras is a physical as well as an emotional or psychologicalsensation.This idea of the chakras and their individual awakenings is central to the ritualsdescribed by Kenneth Grant. He places great emphasis on the necessity for themagician to manipulate the energy passing through the chakras of the priestess, forinstance. Each of the seven chakras possesses a different set of atttributes and siddhis,or occult powers, and it is up to the Thelemic magician to understand these powers andto be able to “switch on” those required by any specific ritual.According to Grant's understanding of the ritual, as the chakra in the femalemagician has been “activated” her entire body undergoes a subtle change. It is thoughtthat the excitation of a specific chakra will trigger the release into the bloodstream of aspecific hormone from one of the glands associated with that chakra. This will, in turn,affect the characteristics of her bodily secretions, which are then collected by themagician for use in this—or another—ritual.How this is done, and the steps to be taken to effect these changes, is the subjectaddressed in the following pages. While Grant utilizes many Sanskrit and other termsin his descriptions of the magical rituals he and his group employed in London in the1950s and 1960s, some of what he describes may be unfamiliar to those alreadyschooled in Tantra, even of the Kaula or Nath variety. It is to be understood thatTantric rituals and concepts were incorporated by Grant into a Western-styleceremonial magic system already developed by Kabbalists and those interested inEgyptian religion, etc. He never claimed to be a Tantric adept himself, and he"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"shamelessly used whatever Tantric techniques and ideas came his way in his own formof bricolage. Then, as his group progressed even further, Lovecraftian concepts wereadded to the mix: a step which would, of course, be wholly objectionable to orthodoxTantrikas. Thus, just as Crowley cannot be used as a source for Egyptian religion,Kenneth Grant cannot be referenced as a source for Tantra. However, his contributionto the field of Western magic and particularly Thelema is not appreciated until onerealizes that Grant did more to explain Tantric principles and rituals than any otherWestern occultist to that point, and to show how important they were towards a deeperunderstanding of Thelema. Today, we have an embarrassment of riches wheretranslations of Tantric texts are concerned, and many knowledgeable scholars in thefield who are excellent sources for more solid information. Grant, however, gives usTantra within the context of Thelema and Western ceremonial magic—something theacademics are not, as yet, able to do with any degree of authority.One further note on the chakras:The alert reader will have noticed that there are seven chakras (traditionally; sometexts and practitioners claim fewer or greater as the case may be). These seven areapproached, one by one, in an ascent up the human body from the base of the spine tothe top of the head. This is obviously analogous to the “stairway to heaven” asrepresented in the Egyptian Pyramid Texts, Sumerian and Babylonian religion, theascent literature of Jewish mysticism, shamanistic ascents, the “Walking” ritual of theNecronomicon, etc. It is also analogous to the Chinese system of “walking” on theseven stars of the Big Dipper (part of the Great Bear constellation). These are allcognate ideas that represent something basic and central to the human condition wherespiritual evolution and the quest for immortality is concerned. What the concept ofKundalini—and the Grant systems of magic associated with it—offers us is the abilityto re-interpret these magical and mystical systems as taking place within the confinesof our own, individual bodies.The seven stars of the Dipper are thus within us as the seven chakras, just as theseven “planets” are present as the chakras, and the seven chariots in merkavahmysticism. The genius of Crowley (and later Grant) was in identifying these analoguesand realizing that they represented something tangible and real: secret knowledge anda workable technique for attaining that knowledge. And while traditional Kundaliniyoga is an internal practice, Crowley and Grant externalized the process so that itbecame possible to engage in the practice in groups such as the OTO and other occultcells or—as Grant calls them—“power-zones” of dedicated adepts scattered across theearth (like chakras in the body of the priestess). The Gnostic Mass, for instance, is justsuch an externalization of the process of Kundalini yoga and in the hands of genuineadepts can become a powerful engine of spiritual transformation or, as Lovecraftwould have it, a terrible device for summoning hideous creatures to visible appearance.Only when mind and body are thus in accord, and when the mind concentrates"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"the image or “child” that the body is to bear, is an act of magical creationpossible. This child is rarely a human child, but it is physical in the sense that itinfluences the material plane.172In Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God—only the second of the nine volumes thatcomprise the Typhonian Trilogies—Grant lays out the general program of the ritual, inthe chapter entitled “Dream Control by Sexual Magick.” While many variations on thisritual appear in his later works, the basic format is the one to be found here.He first introduces three states of consciousness, the dream state, the dreamlessstate, and the waking state. Later, he will identify the dream state as being analogous tothe Mauve Zone: an intermediary state between that of waking and deep, dreamlesssleep. Grant claims that all activity has its origin in the dream state, whether theactivity is conscious and willed or instinctual and reactive. The dream state is the planeon which both mental and astral activity takes place. It is also, remember, the state inwhich—according to Lovecraft—the High Priest Cthulhu communicates with hisfollowers. In the Grant system, this is not a purely fictional device.Grant credits the German occultist Eugen Grosche (“Frater Saturnus”) with havingdiscovered part of the secret of using sexual ritual to induce a trance that wouldprovide an entrance to the same state as that experienced in dreams, with the obviousadvantage that one can then control the dream. This is done by the male magician—inthis case—making the equivalent of mesmeric passes over a female priestess in a stateof sexual excitement with the goal of accumulating and then collecting her heavilycharged secretions.173 Grant expanded on this technique considerably, aided by hisreceipt of important Tantric texts from mysterious sources and through his own studyand practice leading the Nu-Isis Lodge.There are a few Tantric terms it would be wise to introduce at this point since they willcome up frequently in discussions of Grant's sexual magic.The first is prana. This means “breath” and is the basis for the term pranayama,which is a form of breath control. As mentioned previously, breathing is one of thebodily functions that occurs automatically: we don't have to remember to breathe, andcan breathe in our sleep. But conscious control of breathing is easy, and it is thegateway to control over other the autonomic functions which then gives us a degree ofcontrol over the reptilian brain, the part of ourselves that is easily more than 500million years old and which is the physical pathway to the unconscious mind.The second important term is kala. In Grant's usage the kalas are units of time andrefer specifically to the days of the menstrual cycle and to the “essences” that aresecreted on each of those days. Each day of the lunar (and menstrual) fortnight has itsown kala, and each kala is different from every other in certain ways. There arefourteen or fifteen kalas, depending on how they are defined and divided. The fifteenth"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"kala is sometimes considered the day when the menstrual flow begins, or the day of theheaviest menstrual flow. The association of the lunar calendar with the menstrual cycleand, in particular. with the onset of the menstrual flow gave rise to the concept of theGoddess Fifteen, which is one way of referring to Kali, the Bloody Goddess who isoften thought of as an avatar of Shakti. The Goddess Fifteen is also analogous to theScarlet Woman, for obvious reasons.However, one form of the word kala symbolically represents the number sixteen,and the sixteenth kala is considered a great secret and the sum total of the values of theother fifteen. Sixteen is also the number of vowels (known as the matrikas or “littlemothers”) in the Sanskrit alphabet and they are used along with the consonants to formthe all-important Sri Cakra (a diagram of many interlocking triangles, very popular inIndian religion and Tantra) to which Grant also refers—as it is a map of the power-zones with which he is most concerned. (See page 259.)There is a lot of confusion over the word kala, for depending on how it is written, itmay refer to a unit of time (as we have seen) but also the number sixteen, and is relatedto ideas about the goddess Kali and even the demon Kali. In a system of transliterationused by many scholars today, the word kAla means “black” and also “death,” while theword kalA means “menstrual discharge,” and the word kala means “semen.” KalA alsomeans one-sixteenth of the moon's diameter which thus gives us the kalas asunderstood by Grant, and kAla gives us the planet Saturn. While a Sanskrit scholar willbe aware of these differences and not confuse or conflate them, Grant uses the phoneticsimilarities between these words the same way he uses gematria and other word-playin his writings, to show deeper connections where a scholar would most likely object.(Imagine equating the words “week” and “weak” because of their homophony, or“feet” and “feat.” To an English-speaking person, such an equivalence is ridiculous,yet there is evidence of this type of cavalier approach in many of Grant's works, ofwhich equating kAla and kalA are just one example. To give him credit, he does admitthat this is more in the line of stream-of-consciousness analysis than a literalKabbalistic approach.) Yet, even in this short list of possible meanings for thephoneme “kala” we have ideas that are related in Grant's thesis: black, death,menstrual discharge, semen, a unit of time, and a sixteenth of the moon's diameter, aswell as Saturn (planetary representative of the Dark Lord) itself. The appearance ofSaturn in this list is interesting because the Greek word for Saturn is Chronos, fromwhich we get the word for “time” such as in “chronology.” Thus Saturn and time arelinked in English, and Saturn and time are linked in Sanskrit as well. Whether this isreason enough to use Grant's method is debatable, however.There are many variations in the kalas (as vaginal discharges) depending on therelationship between the actual lunar cycle and the menstrual cycle of the priestess. Inaddition, the secretion of specific hormones from specific glands during the ritual willinfluence the quality of the kalas. Thus, the body of the priestess is a kind of laboratory"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"and when the priestess has herself attained more advanced levels of initiation then shebecomes both a laboratory and a temple: the biological functions have psycho-spiritualanalogues which are under (conscious or unconscious) control of the priestess duringthe rituals; i.e., the priestess may be in a trance at the time of the ritual, and utteringoracular statements all the while, but her training and initiation have given her theability to respond appropriately—even instinctively—to the magician or priest who isperforming it. We will return to the concept of the kalas as we examine the ritual itself.The next term which comes up frequently in Grant's work is ojas. In Sanskrit itmeans vigor, strength, power, energy, light, and related ideas.174 Grant uses it in thesense of magical energy, and ojas may be thought of as the natural result of properlycharging the kalas during the ritual. The kalas by themselves are considered magicallyinert until they have been subjected to the ritual attention of the priest. Once they havebeen successfully charged, they are then carriers of the ojas, or magical energy. Thenormal menstrual cycle (i.e., the kalas in their normal physical state) is linked tonormal human reproduction, but when the kalas have been charged then the possibilityof super-human reproduction has been attained.The term mudra is also important in yoga and in Tantra. Mudra means “seal” and isa gesture, a sign made with the hands and fingers in different positions (similar toasanas, which are positions involving the entire body). These gestures “seal” openingsin the subtle body, as well as transmit information to others. Each mudra has a specificcharacteristic attributed to it, a power inherent in the positioning of the fingers and thepalm. We are familiar with Western forms of the mudra, such as holding one's handwith the palm out, signifying “stop,” or with both hands held up with empty palmssignifying “surrender.” In yoga, the mudras have similar associations but all on thespiritual level rather than the secular one. One mudra may mean the union of male andfemale, for instance, while another mudra indicates the outpouring of blessings. Andwhile the positioning of hands in Western culture carries information only, in yoga andin Tantra the mudras are themselves not only carriers of data but are also carriers ofmagical power. A mudra performed the right way can be imbued with force by theTantrika so that it functions much as the magical gestures of fictional sorcerers andmagicians. A mudra also forces the practitioner to be acutely aware of the force beinggenerated as the awkward positions of the hands communicate a level of stress back tothe initiate which reinforces the original intent. In Grant's work, the Mahamudra—or“Great Mudra”—is represented by the Stele of Revealing: the Goddess Nuit archedover the earth which he sees as the Thelemic counterpart to the Kailasha Prastara, orthe sexual position in which the woman is over the man.175 This position is analogousto that usually shown in icons of the Goddess Kali who stands upon the corpse-likebody of Shiva; this is the depiction of Shakti—of feminine Power—in its most blatantand extreme form, and is also a warning to those who desire to practice the rite we arediscussing without being fully prepared, for the Shakti can become unmanageable and"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"wild in inexpert hands. This is also the position most effective for the collection of thekalas from the genital outlet of the priestess, a topic to which we will return shortly.The asana is a yogic position which places a degree of stress on the human body,again forcing concentration but also manipulating the body in such a way as to activatecertain of its subtle centers, its chakras. Asanas are used in meditation, and are alsoused in such practices as Kundalini yoga or hatha yoga in which the body is contortedthrough different levels of difficulty which results in the yogin becoming aware of theinner workings of the body and the interrelationships that exist between different partsof the outer and inner corpus. They also impact the autonomic nervous system,especially when paired with pranayama exercises and the recitation of mantras, andfacilitate higher states of spiritual and psycho-sexual awareness.Prana as already mentioned is usually translated as “breath” but in Tantra there aremultiple pranas. Normally when speaking of bodily functions the Tantrika is notreferring to those with which we are familiar, the visible emblems of these functions,but with their subtler aspects. Thus, prana is not simply “breath” the way weunderstand it, but subtler aspects of the same. There are at least five “breaths” or fivepranas recognized in yoga and Tantra: prana is the breath of inhalation, the breath thatnourishes life, and enters through the nostrils; udana is the exhalation, most noticeablein the act of speech; samana is the breath that aids digestion; apana is the breathinvolved in peristalsis and excretion; and finally vyana is the breath that movesinternally through the body and which stimulates motion and movement of the bodythrough space.Mantras are syllables or words that have specific associations with deities orspiritual qualities. They can be as short as a single syllable (a bija or seed mantra) oras long as a sentence or a verse. Their value lies in the manipulation of sound.Sound is vibration, and different mantras—because of different combinations ofvowels and consonants—vibrate at different rates when spoken, and these levels can beadjusted through the use of volume and pitch. They also help to quiet the mind byreplacing chaotic inner voices and random thoughts with a string of seeminglymeaningless syllables, thus essentially short-circuiting the language centers of thebrain.Mantras, asanas and mudras, and pranayama all are designed to counteract thenormal functions of the mind and the body. Obviously, occultism is not aboutreinforcing our basic instincts for survival, but in violating them as much as possiblewithout actually damaging either the mind or the body, stretching the capabilities ofboth in ways that are initially uncomfortable and unnatural but which in the end openthe doors of perception.We have presented the basic Sanskrit terms and concepts that are used quite freelyby Grant in virtually every volume of the Trilogies. There are many more, as well asreferences to specific Tantric texts, but we will not list them all here. Rather, as we"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"come to a relevant citation we will pause to ensure that the reader is completelyinformed ... or as informed as possible under the circumstances. In order to readCrowley, one should have a good general education in Kabbalah, Egyptian religion,and the Golden Dawn system of initiation; to read Grant, one needs all of that plus adeep background in Indian religion, especially Tantra, some Afro-Caribbean conceptsand terms, and of course the basic reading in Lovecraft's ouevre. It is a daunting taskfor the general reader, to be sure, and it is hoped that this study will facilitate greaterunderstanding of the writings of this important occult author as well as encouragewider reading in the topics covered."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The Collection of the KalasIt should be noted that Grant's preoccupation is with the magical aspect of Tantra.Even though he does acknowledge its basic theological premises and the Hindu andBuddhist formulas for withdrawing from the world of illusion to attain the ultimatelevel of enlightenment, he is still quite distracted by the practical uses to which Tantricprinciples may be applied. This is due at least partly to his Thelemic allegiance,otherwise why not simply become a Tantrika and abandon Thelema (and by extensionWestern occultism) entirely? Tantra represents a collection of texts, practices, and apeculiar worldview; Thelema on the other hand pretends to be a global spiritualmovement with the aim of liberating all peoples in the New Aeon. The pursuit ofTantra is a highly individual one, even though small groups may be involved. Thepursuit of Thelema, on the other hand, requires a broader social perspective. Grant, asmuch as he admires Tantra, still sees it as a tool—among many in the Thelemicworkshop. He interprets much of Thelema in Tantric terms and this may be because attimes he sees Thelema as a “Tantra for the West,” and at other times he senses thatboth disciplines are discussing the same basic principles and he cannot resist pursuingthose links and associations as deeply as possible because the one may help explain theother ... or enrich the other through the additional correspondences. In other words, hemust find Tantra lacking in something, a something that Thelema can provide.It is certain that Tantra is Indo-centric. All the terminology and references are toIndian religion, culture and language and require a knowledge of what is popularlyknown as Hinduism, and Buddhism. This would be ideologically unpalatable to afollower of Thelema who may recognize—intellectually—the contributions of the sub-continent to world religions but who would reject Hindu and Buddhist belief systems.Thus, Grant's project is to strip away as much of the Indian component of Tantra ashe is able and to replace it with Western occult and magical references. (It is a re-interpretation of Tantra, which is why it would be rejected by Tantrikas in Asia andmost likely by Tantra scholars in the West.) In order to accomplish this, Grant needs tolook at the technology of Tantra—the rituals themselves—and peel away theobjectionable theology as much as possible. What he is left with should be a system ofuniversal applicability, interpreted within the Thelemic context. And this, of course, isfeasible.In recent years this approach has been made somewhat easier by the works ofscholars in Jewish mysticism and alchemy who have speculated that Tantra may verywell be the fons et origo of the Sepher ha-Zohar, for instance, and who use Tantricreferences to help expand upon Kabbalistic and alchemical themes.In addition, Tantra has always been a controversial field and even the definition ofTantra eludes most scholars, Asian and Western, so an eccentric British magician'spoint of view may be as legitimate as anyone else's."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"That said, we will now look at how Grant understands the intensely sexual rituals hedescribes in the Trilogies. We will take as our starting point and template the briefdescription of those rituals he provides in Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God.This basic form can be characterized as an initiated version of Crowley's GnosticMass. It involves a priest and priestess, or a magician and a “witch” (in the popular,not the Wiccan, sense). There may be others in attendance, but the prime operators area male and a female couple.The goal of the ritual is the collection of kalas, the magically-charged vaginalsecretions of the female partner before they become ojas. We will ignore for themoment the timing issue, as it is a bit complex, but will return to it later on. There isalso a appended to this volume a list of the kalas—as lunar digits—and their associatedcharacteristics (probably the first time this has been presented to a Western, occult-oriented readership).The priestess should be an initiate capable of raising Kundalini. That does not meanthat she should be able to raise it perfectly through all six chakras to reside in theseventh, but she should be capable of stimulating the rise of Kundalini to a certainlevel. The priest may assist in helping her raise it to higher and higher chakras duringthe ritual, but only as long as there is no danger to the priestess.The intention of the ritual must be clear from the outset, plainly stated so that allparticipants are in agreement. This must reflect an act of will from all parties,otherwise the ritual degenerates into a form of “vampirism” with the magician usingthe priestess for his own ends, or vice versa.In the Thelemic context we have been discussing, the ritual space must be createdaccording to the understanding of the magician, perhaps using the Star Sapphire or StarRuby rituals to cast a circle: a sacred space, a chakra. The design of the altar and thespace may be purely Thelemic, or it may also incorporate Tantric elements such as theSri Chakra which represents interlocking power-zones based on triangles, the letters ofthe Sanskrit alphabet, etc. and is a form of the yoni—or vulva—of the Goddess.Perfumes should be chosen with care, to reflect the nature of the ritual.Lighting should also be carefully designed before hand. It is common in Westernceremonial magic to use candles of a certain number, a certain color, etc. and this maybe employed. Or oil lamps may be used instead.The altar should be provided with a mat or some soft covering for that is where thepriestess will be located during the most intense portions of the ritual. The altar shouldface the north, or the head of the priestess should be in the north, for that is from wherethe amrita will descend. This is especially so if the ritual is being performed atmidnight on the night of the Full Moon, for at that time the Moon is directly overhead(i.e. in the south) and the Sun will be directly opposite, in the north. In the case ofTantra, and the collection of amrita, the Moon is male and the Full Moon is full of the"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"nectar of immortality (the semen of the God Chandra), and the Sun is female, red andpulsing with heat and fire. If it is desired to incorporate Lovecraftian elements in theritual (as Grant's cultus was known to do) then the appropriate times may be chosenaccording to the position of the Big Dipper, but always with further reference to theposition and the quarter of the Moon.The deities should be invoked into the priest and priestess, so that they identify withtheir respective godforms. They may partake of alcohol at this time, both in homage tothe original pancatattva ritual of the Kaula Circles but also because this was a methodCrowley also used in order to release inhibitions in his assistants. Naturally, only a sipof alcohol should be employed.The central part of the ritual now takes place, which involves the priestess raisingKundalini. According to Grant, this transpires as she is being sexually aroused by themagician who is performing certain mudras over her body, not necessarily touchingher but making passes directly over her erogenous zones (with a wand or with hishands) and raising her to a fever pitch. The goal of this process is to activateKundalini, to raise it gradually to the higher chakras so that they may be “burned” bythe power of the Serpent Goddess and thus release their potencies into the bloodstreamof the priestess. These chakras should have been previously opened by the priestessthrough Kundalini yoga or some other technique, otherwise opening them for the firsttime this way can be dangerous to her. The magician should bring the priestess to thepoint of orgasm, but stop just before orgasm is reached. The magician may have sexualintercourse with the priestess if it is considered necessary to bring the priestess to thedesired pitch of excitement, but neither priest not priestess should achieve orgasm atthis point because it is premature to “ground” or “earth” the energy before it has beenfully utilized. (This is in contradistinction to much normative Tantra which requiresthe orgasms of both parties and even the ejaculation of the male in order for the rite tobe “perfect.”) It is necessary that there is a flow of secretions from the female genitaloutlet. These kalas will be collected by the magician—either orally, as in cunnilingus,if the intention is to increase the occult power of the magician or to bring him intocontact with supramundane forces, etc.; or on a specially constructed talisman of metalor parchment, or on the leaf of a sacred plant, or some other way if the intention is tostore it for future use. The magician will then energize them magically so that theybecome ojas.In an operation described in Beyond the Mauve Zone, the magician can also usedisks of some metal, placed ove the chakras of the priestess in order to becomemagnetically charged by the ritual. This occurs as an operation of what Grant calls“stellar magic” and involves the sixth, or ajna, chakra. The idea is to charge thischakra—what Grant calls the “sixth power-zone”—so that it magnetically attracts theFire Snake, causing it to rise from the muladhara chakra up the sushumna (the “middlepillar” of the body) to reach the ajna chakra. The metal disks collect the ojas that are"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"generated this way and are then kept in a closed jar for later use, when they may bedrenched in the kalas of the priestess to activate them further.What is the goal of this type of magical ritual? A predictably Lovecraftian one:In due course is born a being that is adapted perfectly to existence on a chosenstar.176This is an extremely delicate operation. If either the priest or the priestess becomesdistracted by lust and by the need to satisfy themselves in orgasm ahead of time thenconcentration has been lost and the rite loses all its efficacy. The kalas become“earthed” in their usual way, and all that is left is two persons having sexualintercourse. That both participants remain in a heightened state of concentration andfocus is critical to the success of the ritual. From the magical point of view, there isnothing particularly powerful in semen and vaginal secretions if they have not beencharged previous to being released. The object is not to create a human child (mostpeople can manage that), but something else entirely (as the above quotation fromGrant illustrates).As we have seen, the Valentinians concentrated on the Divine during sex so that theywould produce Divine offspring. The method seems strangely similar. Old Whateleywas concentrating on incarnating one of the Old Ones on earth. Crowley's quasi-fictional magicians in his most famous novel were pretending to create a Moonchild.Magic is the creation of forms, of illusions, of whole new realities. In Tibetanshamanism, this is known as creating tulpas: homunculi designed for specificpurposes, as was most famously recounted by Alexandra David-Neel. And in Jewishmysticism, we have the Golem.Thus, what is needed is not two sexually-active people who will have intercoursesurrounded by weird diagrams and sandalwood incense. Instead, we need twointelligent and mature—and dedicated—magicians who will push the envelope ofsensation as far as it will go, realizing that their sexual energy is more than a metaphorfor the primal act of creation—and that it contains power of an incredible nature iftaken beyond the normal methods required for human reproduction.This brings us to the question of initiation. In the Shakta tradition, the female is themore important partner and the emphasis is placed on her secretions. Tantra in thistradition is a very refined, very highly-articulated form of Goddess worship. Womencan initiate men into this tradition, which is the reverse of what even Crowley wouldapprove. At the same time, the selection of the appropriate partner was an all-consuming endeavor for Crowley and he went through many women in his quest forthe perfect soror mystica, or “sister of the mysteries,” probably due to his reluctance totake women seriously as advanced adepts. To many Tantrikas, the female kalas are thefocus of the rites and the yoni—the vulva—is the object of veneration.The reverse is obviously true for those who favor the Shaivite tradition which"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"elevates the male principle above the female. However, the solution to this problem—as Grant rightly points out177—is the fact that Crowley's New Aeon is the Aeon of theChild: the offspring of the two principles of male and female, of Shiva and Shakti. TheChild partakes of the combined essences and natures of each and represents a newfocus, a new paradigm, for not only magic but for the social order in general. It is, infact, this Magickal Childe that troubles Lovecraft so much that he castigates theconcept as the deformed and dangerous creature conceived by poor Lavinia Whateley,but it is nevertheless the focus (expressed or implied) of all New Aeon magical ritual.Thus, in this case, the kalas are not the only important secretion as the seminal fluidof the magician is also required to effect the “magical birth.” This substance is to becharged just as carefully as the kalas in order to be effective, which requires themagician to practice a form of seminal retention and “recirculation.” Like thepriestess, he must postpone or completely avoid orgasm in order not to “earth” thefluid before it has been charged. He must practice raising Kundalini and sealing thechakras in the same manner as the priestess. In many Tantric traditions it is completelyunnecessary (and moreover undesirable) for the male practitioner to achieve orgasm,and especially forbidden for him to ejaculate and thus waste the seminal fluid and itsassociated subtle essence. Such methods as that known as karezza were employed tokeep the male Tantrika in a constant state of sexual excitement and arousal during theritual. If ejaculation did take place, there were methods for limiting the damage.One to which Grant refers is the practice known as the vajroli mudra, which is a wayof halting ejaculation in pre- or mid-ejaculation. This involves a great deal ofpreliminary work in contracting the urethral sphincter (a practice which is alsobeneficial in curing premature ejaculation). Advanced practitioners are said to be ableto use this method to “vacuum” ejaculated semen from the vagina back into the peniswhere its subtle essence can be drawn up the spine and to the cranial vault as theKundalini rises. The Shiva Samhita—a venerable Tantric text which discusses thevajroli mudra—claims that the loss of semen leads to death and that the Tantrikashould never lose his semen under any circumstances. Other Tantric texts are morelenient, but insist that it takes at least a fortnight to replace the semen expended in anact of sexual intercourse and enormous quantities of food to produce even a singlegram of the substance. The mention of a fortnight in this regard is due to the lunarassociation once again, for the Moon is restored—i.e., the semen of the Moon isreplaced—over a fourteen-day period from New Moon to Full Moon.As David Gordon White points out:... semen is the raw material and fuel of every psychochemical transformationthe yogin, alchemist, or Tantric practitioner undergoes, transformations throughwhich a new, superhuman and immortal body is “conceived” out of the husk ofthe mortal, conditioned, biological body.178"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"To Crowley and his system, the semen is just as important to the creation of theElixir—the amrita or nectar of immortality—as the female kalas. Indeed, it is thecombination of the two that is required and this would seem to be consistent withEuropean alchemical traditions as well. Obviously, in order to produce the magicaloffspring we have been discussing at length there must be a contribution from bothpartners, either in the “earthed” physical sense or in the occult, astral sense. As theemphasis in the New Aeon is said to have switched from the pure male-female (Shiva-Shakti) polarity of the old Aeons to their product as a divine offspring, this wouldseem to make sense and would require the use of such new “grimoires” as theCrowleyan Book of the Law as well as some of the received texts published in Grant'sworks.To the magician, the priestess is no longer the priestess. She is a goddess, a ScarletWoman, a Shakti. To the priestess, the magician is no longer someone she knows in the“real” world, but a god, a Beast, a Shiva. They are drawing down the powers thatexisted since the Creation—the aptly-named Big Bang—by identifying themselveswith the forces that started it all (like Clement's lust-crazed Carpocrations). They aretraveling along the 500 million years of their reptilian brains to enter a space and timethat is otherwise unknowable by living, breathing human beings ... and they are goingfurther and farther than that.And as they do so, their physical bodies undergo transformative changes. Thesechanges begin with the secretion of glandular substances into the bloodstream so thattheir breath, their saliva, their perspiration, their seminal and vaginal fluids vibratewith this new life, this new potency.At the same time, visions are obtained. One of the effects of this type of ritual is thatsuch intensive concentration during a time of sexual arousal leads to a tremendousamount of psychic stress. The body is used to releasing itself in orgasm andejaculation. If this normal pathway is blocked—“sealed”—through mental control andfocus, then the body reacts in such a way that it seeks alternate pathways, thus openinga Gate that is normally closed.A slight shift of focus will result in a shift of vision, of waking trance. If the goalwas to open a Gate, and the focus of both parties is maintained on this goal, then a Gatewill open. The power of the unreleased sexual energy will see to it; and the kalas thatare secreted at this time will enable the operators to more easily open the Gate at afuture time.It is to increase the psycho-sexual tension that the Necronomicon itself states:Know that thou must keep purified for the space of one moon for the Entrance tothe first Step, one moon between the First and the Second Step, and againbetween the Second and the Third, and so on in like manner. Thou must abstainfrom spilling thy seed in any manner for like period of time, but thou mayest"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"worship at the Temple of ISHTAR, provided thou lose not thine Essence. Andthis is a great secret.179The reference to the Temple of Ishtar may be an allusion to temple prostitution, andthe provision that one not lose their Essence should be self-explanatory by now.Prostitutes are not anathema to the Tantrika; far from it. As we already know,Crowley's soror mystica was known as the Scarlet Woman or the Whore of Babalon.To the Tantrika, nothing is ugly or hideous or forbidden, thus prostitutes (proscribedby society even as they are secretly tolerated) are as much representatives of theGoddess as any other woman.The lunar periods are important here, just as they are in Tantric practice. Theapplication is different, of course. The basic theme of the Necronomicon systemknown as “the Walking” is celestial ascent; at the same time, there is a level ofparanoia concerning evil spirits and the evil cults that worship them. Opening thecelestial Gates during the Walking is a core element of the process and it shares muchin common with the Chinese magical system known as the Pace of Yü which involvesproceeding up the seven stars of the Big Dipper, “opening” each of these astral gatesalong the way. The Walking can be interpreted from the point of view of raisingKundalini up the path of the chakras ... and of course the Tantric process can beinterpreted in terms of the Walking. It should be remembered that these seeminglydifferent systems are analogues of each other; that the language used to describe onesystem is essentially the same as the language used to describe the other.The goal of celestial ascent traditions as well as the raising of Kundalini in yoga andTantric traditions is the same: to approach a secret or hidden chamber from whichimmortality can be attained. In celestial ascent literature this is normally viewed as atemple or palace at the top of a ladder of lights—stars or planets—in which Goddwells. In the type of ritual traditions we have been discussing this chamber has aphysical, microcosmic analogue: the cranial vault.Within the brain there is a space that is often referred to as the “bridal chamber.” Itis in the region of the hypothalamus (the Greek word thalamos means “bed chamber”)located somewhat between—and behind—the eyes, what is popularly known as the“Third Eye.” This is the realm of Shiva in Indian tradition: it is where this iconicrecluse and hermit waits in silent meditation until he is roused by his wife Parvati orUma to take part in an extended session of intercourse. It is at the culmination of thissexual embrace that Shiva's semen rains down as amrita: the elixir of immortality.This is sometimes described as the crescent Moon overturning and spilling down theseed as a gentle but rejuvenating rain. In Kundalini terms, the Serpent Goddess israised through the six preliminary chakras to mate with Shiva in an embrace thattriggers the opening of the seventh chakra at the crown of the head. In either case, theresult is the same: the flow of life-giving nectar begins at the top of the head and"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"continues down through all the subtle pathways—the nadis—of the human body. Thisis the Alchemical Wedding and its result, the nectar of immortality and elixir vitae, isthe Sixteenth Kala.While the sexual rite above described seems to focus exclusively on the male as theactive partner, this is not really or always the case. The priestess can control theoutcome of the ritual through her own powers of concentration and control over thepsycho-biological processes taking place in her body. As the magician manipulates hersexual response so that she is near orgasm, she can duplicate what the male Tantrika isable to do in similar circumstances: transfer the complex of sensations (visualized asKundalini) from the groin level to the brain, i.e., from the muladhara chakra to theajna chakra at the level of the Third Eye. This can be done in real physical terms—theway it is taught in Kundalini yoga—or it can be accomplished through visualizationalone, which is the safer (although somewhat less powerful) route. The end-result ofthe ritual—whatever it may be—is visualized as taking place in the cranial vault, in theajna chakra or the thalamus, the “bed chamber,” and it is there that the MagickalChilde is conceived. The term Magickal Childe is used here to refer to the desiredresult of the operation—to charge a talisman, to obtain secret information, etc. etc.—visualized as the offspring of the ritual. Certain Chinese adepts use the same processesto create an immortal body, visualized first in embryonic form extending from thecrown of the head (and thus the seventh chakra) and then gradually becomingmature.180Crowley was aware of the possibility of opening the spatial gateways and ofadmitting an extraterrestrial Current into the human life-wave. In Moonchild theincarnation was effected in and through the normal sexual formula, and althoughthe full impact of the moonchild's advent is not described, the reader is left withthe impression that, whatever it may have been, it was some sort of a monster inhuman form endowed with superhuman powers. But no entity incarnating viathe usual channels of sex, no physical intrusion of another dimension into theambience of humanity could possibly exercise power in any but a terrestrialsense. This is because the “power” has been earthed or enfleshed.181The above statement by Grant eloquently sets forth the parameters of the sexo-magical rite, even to the extent of introducing the possibility that a monster withsuperhuman powers could be incarnated using these techniques. He also reminds usthat the usual channels of sex are not capable of introducing the extraterrestrial Currentinto our own dimension. Control of the body's automatic sexual responses begins withcontrol of the reptilian, or serpent, brain until the entire organism is an instrument tobe played by the initiated magician.

Infact, he cites other magicians who—he claims—have already penetrated those veilsand opened a hole in the earth's protective atmosphere allowing the entry of the OldOnes. In other words, they have opened a Gate.This dangerous process certainly was begun by Crowley, but later was amplified byhis American follower Jack Parsons.

Grant claims that there is a surviving cult of the original Typhonian Traditionknown as the Anuttara Amnaya, which just happens to have the same initials as thesecret society founded by Aleister Crowley, the Astrum Argenteum, or AA TheAnuttara Amnaya is the repository, again according to Grant, of the true practices ofthe Sri Vidya cult which links it to the ancient and all-but-forgotten mysteries of theGreat Old Ones.Before we go too deeply into the weeds of this concept, it is perhaps beneficial if wepull back a little and briefly describe the Sri Vidya cultus and identify the AnuttaraAmnaya as best we can.The word vidya has the same root as Veda, and means “knowledge.” The word Sri isused to mean “divine” or “sacred,” so Sri Vidya means, literally, the sacred knowledge.It is an early form of Tantra, one which several groups (including the Kaula sect) claimas their own lineage.Sri Vidya is also identified as the worship of Sri Devi, the great Mother Goddess,who in this system manifests as Lakshmi Tripura Sundari, or Lakshmi (“the Playful”)of the Three Cities. (The identity of the “three cities” is subject to controversy but maybe identified as sat-cit-ananda—Existence-Consciousness-Bliss—and in Grant'sschema Consciousness is identified as having three states: waking, sleeping anddreaming.) Lakshmi Tripura Sundari is usually depicted as a Red Goddess, a young girlof sixteen years of age dressed completely in red and sitting on a red lotus throne,adorned by a single lunar digit, or kala. In this mode she is called Shodashi (“sixteen”as in “sixteen years old” but also clearly a reference to the Sixteenth Kala) or evensimply Bala (“young girl”). Her power is the power of Consciousness itself, or Cit-Shakti. It is Lakshmi Tripura Sundari who is worshipped via the Sri Vidya cult's mostfamous emblem, the Sri Cakra which is her symbol and which represents the entirecosmos.The Anuttara Amnaya is one of six “subsidiary” vidyas of the Sri Vidya tradition.The word amnaya is related to agama, a word that can mean “religion” or a type ofspecial knowledge that is handed down from generation to generation, such as a“sacred tradition.” It is often used as a reference to sacred texts in general and toTantra itself. The word anuttara is usually translated as “highest” or “absolute.”183Thus, Anuttara Amnaya is the Highest Tradition or the Supreme Tantra. It does notrefer to a specific group of devotees or sect, but is usually used to identify a specificset of Vidyas within the Sri Vidya tradition, a school of Tantra with its own mandala,"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"teachings, etc. Followers of the Sri Vidya tradition may be initiated (diksha) into oneor all of the six amnayas, so that the Anuttara Amnaya is really a school within thegreater Sri Vidya tradition. Yet, Anuttara Amnaya is also referred to as the “seat” ofthe Goddess Lakshmi Tripura Sundari: subtle, difficult of access, but a path above andbeyond all others.The Sri Yantra or Sri Chakra is an ancient geometric depiction of the body ofthe Goddess.There is, however, a darker aspect to all of this and it involves Shiva in hisincarnation as Hatakeswara or Hatakeshvara. In this incarnation, Shiva is the ruler ofone of the seven infernal hells or Patala of Indian religion, specifically Vitala. Thehells of Patala are inhabited by the Nagas (or serpent gods) as well as by the variousIndian demons, such as the Yakshas. Yet, oddly, it is precisely Shiva in his form ofHatakeswara who rules Anuttara Amnaya and guarantees immediate enlightenment toits practitioners. According to the Hatakeswara Stotra (a hymn to Hatakeswara), theLords of Hell pour forth from the mouth of Shiva-Hatakeswara. Thus, in thismanifestation, Shiva is nothing other than the Dark Lord himself and the ruler ofKenneth Grant's Anuttara Amnaya cult ... and the Goddess of the Sri Vidya tradition isa form of the Scarlet Woman, the Goddess Sixteen."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Now for the weeds."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Marmas, Sandhis ... and QlippotThe Sri Chakra is a map similar in nature—if not design—to the Kabbalistic Tree ofLife and perhaps related more closely to the Enochian Tablets as employed by theGolden Dawn. It consists of nine large triangles—four pointing up, five down—superimposed on each other and thus making a total of 43 triangles and the intersectionpoints (the marmas and sandhis) between them.184 Around these triangles are an eight-petaled lotus, a sixteen-petaled lotus, and three concentric circles around them. Aroundthat is often drawn a diagram representing four Gates in the four cardinal directions.The Sri Chakra is an entire cosmological system but it is also the body of the Goddessin schematic form. Although it is a two-dimensional figure—a drawing—it also hasbeen made in three-dimensions: the only one of all the Indian chakras permitted to beconstructed this way.The characterization of the Sri Chakra as the body of the Goddess is not an idle one.The marmas—the intersection points where triangles overlap—have their analogues inmarmas in the human body: similar, in fact, to acupuncture points in Chinesemedicine. Ayurvedic medicine is concerned with applying pressure, through massage,to the appropriate marmas in order to promote healing. There is even an Indian martialarts technique called marma adi, which is a method of killing or disabling a humanbeing by the correct application of pressure—a strike—at one of the twelve “deathmarmas” on the body (there are 96 healing marmas, and 12 “death” marmas, for a totalof 108 marmas in the human body).To Grant, the marmas on the Sri Chakra and the marmas on the body are reflectionsof each other. During the ritual we described in the last chapter, the magician is tomake passes (or mudras) over the body of the priestess in order to stimulate theactivity of specific marmas which in turn affect the chakras. Grant believes that thekalas are brought down from the Mauve Zone into the body of the priestess during theritual and that the stimulation of the appropriate marmas helps to accomplish this.Then the Kundalini—which Grant has begun calling the Fire Snake—is encouraged torise through the body of the priestess, sealing the chakras as it proceeds to the cranialvault.According to Grant in “mystical” Tantra (if such a thing truly exists), the raising ofthe Fire Snake to the cranial vault is the ultimate goal, for when the Goddess Kundaliniand the God Shiva meet the hierogamos or sacred marriage is complete. The Tantrikaeventually achieves union with the Absolute and attains advaita, or non-duality. But inthe Kaula Circles that are the primary channel for Sri Vidya, the power that has beenraised is drawn back down to the muladhara chakra where it is collected by themagician. This is the “magical” approach to Tantra rather than a mystical one andGrant is not bashful about this. He implies that the acquisition of siddhis—magicalpowers—is the goal of his system. He equates the first type of Tantra with the elixir"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"vitae of the alchemists (the amrita), and the second form of Tantra with the Stone ofthe Wise, the Philosopher's Stone. To a Tantrika, this is an unenlightened approach andone that is usually condemned as unworthy; moreover it is factually incorrect. TheTantras do indeed prescribe the oral consumption of the kalas directly from the genitaloutlet, the yoni, of the priestess and in fact also generally insist that the elixir isobtained by the mixture of both the kalas—the menstrual discharges—and the semenof the male operator, what is known in the Gnostic Mass as the “cakes of light.” Theonly deviations from this rule concern the ability of the male Tantrika to achieveorgasm without ejaculation, in which the absence of semen is acceptable, or when themale Tantrika is engaged in maithuna—the sexual embrace—with a married womannot his wife, in which case (and according to some Tantras) it is preferable that theTantrika not ejaculate or not ejaculate in the yoni of his partner. (The Tantras are allover the place where ritual requirements are concerned, and what is and is notdesirable or permissable.) What Grant discusses is perfectly comprehensible in termsof the Western magical tradition, with its conscious manipulation and exploitation ofmind and body, and that is perhaps where he parts company with normative Tantra. Hisfocus on the raw technology of the system rather than on the philosophy behind it—theHindu and Buddhist ethical and spiritual traditions—alienates Tantric scholars andTantrikas. However, it satisfies the need of Western occultists who are not interested inthe ethos of the system (who see such considerations as purely theological and thusideological) but in the psycho-biological apparatus of the human body itself, and howaltered states of consciousness and experiences of other realities can be attainedthrough manipulating its inner processes.In addition, Grant's claim that the kalas are brought down from Beyond to the bodyof the priestess implies that there is a strong stellar or astral component to whatappears to be a psycho-sexual or bio-chemical process. Of course, when the full detailsof the rite are considered—which includes the lunar phases and other astrologicalconsiderations—it becomes obvious that what Grant claims has, in fact, validity.Imagine a solar panel in a land where there is no sun: it doesn't matter that the panel iscreated perfectly and all its parts are in working order; if there is no sun, there is nopower. In the case of what Grant begins to call the Ritual of the Fire Snake, the body ofthe priestess is the solar panel; the ritual must be timed so that the “sun” is present inthe right place at the right time for the panel to provide energy.This is true of all ceremonial magic, as any glance at the medieval grimoires wouldcertainly reveal. Magical rituals depend as much on correct timing as they do on thepreparation of the magician and the occult implements to be employed. It is thisemphasis on timing—in Tantra, in Daoist magic, in alchemy, and in Western magic—that reveals the deeper character of occultism in its dependence on the interrelationshipbetween the microcosm and the macrocosm. What casual observers may not realize,however, is that the macrocosm can be just as dangerous as the microcosm. After all,"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Cthulhu can be summoned only “when the stars are right.”This leads to another element of Grant's thesis: that these marmas or entry pointsinto the Mauve Zone exist in space, exist in the human body, and exist on the earth.Here they are power-zones on the body of the planet, exploited by cults or groups ofadepts who are sensitive to their use and initiated into their mysteries. Such marmasrepresent, as the blurb on the first edition of Grant's Outside the Circles of Time states:... a network more complex than was ever imagined: a network not unlike H. P.Lovecraft's dark vision of sinister forces lurking at the rim of the universe.The Sri Chakra, like any perfect cosmological system, must take into account theexistence of what the non-initiate may term “evil.” Some of the marmas and sandhisprovide means of entering areas of existence that are inimical or hostile to normalhuman consciousness: the realms of the demons, or Nagas. It is, in fact, precisely theseregions that most attract the attention of Kenneth Grant.One of the schemes that can introduce the Western occultist to this concept is that ofLiber 231, a small treatise by Crowley that is concerned entirely with the realm of theShells, the qlippot. In order to appreciate this text it is necessary to understand that theTree of Life of the Kabbalists—consisting of ten spheres or sefirot joined by twenty-two paths representing the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet—also has a “darkside.”According to the Golden Dawn system of interpreting the Tree of Life, there is a“space between” the lower seven sefirot and the upper three. This “space between” isreferred to as the Abyss. It is sometimes believed to be the realm of another sefirah,Daath. In diagrams of the Tree this sphere is often shown with a dotted instead of asolid circle to signify that it is not a “true” sefirah in the scheme of things but a“shadow sphere.”In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Daath was the subject of muchspeculation and it was Jacob Frank—a messianic figure of the eighteenth century whocombined Jewish, Islamic and Christian concepts in his movement—who emphasizedthe importance of Daath to his own system. To Grant, Daath is the “Outer Gateway” tothe Mauve Zone. It is a kind of “anti-sefirah.”In addition to Daath, there are the qlippot which are described in Crowley's Liber231. These are the shells of a shattered sphere from the first Creation (according to onetradition) and they occupy twenty-two “anti-paths” on the Tree of Life. The marmasand sandhis on the Sri Chakra are points, or bindus, on the diagram that are theintersections of lines; the qlippot are paths between the spheres on the Tree of Life, sothey more resemble lines than points. But this is a superficial difference. In practice,the qlippot are as much gateways to the Other Side as specific marmas or sandhis.Liber 231 is one of the Holy Books, which was received, along with the others wehave already discussed earlier, that were written by Crowley during a white heat of"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"inspiration at the same time that Lovecraft decided the Rites of Cthulhu were takingplace in New Orleans. Crowley does not give any instructions for how the mysterioustables of the 22 qlippot—the 22 “scales of the serpent”—should be used. It waseventually up to Grant and his Lodge to explore the possibilities and to use the tablesas a map for penetrating the Mauve Zone. These 22 “demonic” or “qlippothic” pathsare the Tunnels of Set that Grant opines lies between the realm of dreams and therealm of dreamless sleep (which latter is itself analogous to the state of non-duality).They are reflexes of the 22 paths on the Tree of Life, shadows of those paths, forming aShadow Tree of which Daath is the central Gate. His New Isis Lodge workedextensively with the qlippot and specifically with Liber 231 in an attempt to map itspotentialities.Grant goes further, attempting to link the 22 qlippot with an equal number of kalas.The number of kalas seem to multiply with the systems applied, and this equating ofthem with the Tunnels of Set may be ill-advised. (A similar problem exists withCrowley's attribution of the I Jing trigrams with the sefirot on the Tree of Life; thenumber systems do not equate and it is a violence to try to force them to fit. There areother, better solutions.) While the kalas are vaginal secretions that can be used aselixirs it is not certain whether these secretions can or should be equated with theqlippot on a one-to-one basis. If the qlippot are pathways—the Tunnels of Set, as Grantcalls them—then the kalas may very well be the fuel that enables one to travel them, orthe keys to opening their gates.Grant employs both systems—Tantra and Kabbalah—in his lengthy digressions onthe nature of the Mauve Zone and the realm of Darkness where the Old Ones dwell.And it is through ceremonial technologies such as the Ritual of the Fire Snake thatcontact can be made with this realm by using specific gateways. The Kabbalists wouldemploy the qlippot system and the sphere of the Abyss, Daath, in their approach towhat Grant calls the “Nightside of Eden.” And the practitioners of the Kaula Circles orthe Anuttara Amnaya would employ appropriate marmas and sandhis of the SriChakra, in combination with the kalas and the ojas. In either case, a psycho-sexualtechnique is employed: either the sexual magic of Aleister Crowley, the OTO, or theHermetic Brotherhood of Light, or the Tantric rituals of the Kaula Circles. KennethGrant was able to combine both of these approaches, largely through identifyingcognate ideas and methods and by “porting” one system over to the other,incorporating Tantric techniques within a Western, ceremonial framework.While this approach may seem wholly arbitrary to some, the infusion of genuineTantric methods within the Thelemic rituale produced a spark of new life into thelatter. As we can see from Grant's published work the new insights that were obtainedby using Tantric techniques in a Western ceremonial setting were remarkable. And therush of prose out of Grant's pen due to this combustible mix is alone evidence of howthe secret rites of the Nu-Isis Lodge were able to fuel nine non-fiction works on the"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"subject, as well as much fiction and poetry, not counting the contributions of othermembers of the Grant circle.And this is as it should be, according to Grant, for it is the Mauve Zone that is thesource of all human creativity, imagination, fascination, and obsession. It isrepresented in the microcosm by a zone that exists between the dream state and thedeeper, dreamless state, and is the source of artistic impulses and contact with divineand demonic forces. But these are its positive characteristics. There are negative onesas well, and they are the forces that challenge the magician on an individual basis justas they confront society in general. These are the demonic forces that so frighten theprotagonists of the Lovecraft ouevre. And summoning them—or any aspect of theMauve Zone—can have disastrous consequences.The French poet Artur Rimbaud famously declared that it was necessary, in order tobecome a Seer, to engage the complete “derangement of the senses.” Our normalsensory state is designed to cope with the visible world, in order to ensure the survivalof the body; only the shamans, initiates, magicians and alchemists look beyondmaintaining the integrity of the physical body and extending consciousness beyondthat of the visible, tangible universe. In order to do this, risks are taken.The methods used to “derange the senses” or alter perception may include drugs,alcohol, fasting, or other tools that are potentially dangerous to the human organismand counter-intuitive when it comes to discussing the health and survival of the body.It is as if the body's normal systems and processes must be challenged in order that aspace be made for the new experiences. This is because our minds and bodies are partof an integrated “psychosomatic” system, and an effect on one will have an impact onthe other. This is what Grant calls the “retroversion” of the body's normal processes.Retroversion is a method he identifies specifically with Set, the Dark Lord—as Setrepresents “evil” in the cosmic scheme, or those things that challenge the status quo.We have already seen this in our discussion of the necessity of conscious controlover the body's autonomic nervous system and the reptilian brain. In order toexperience altered states of the mind it is therefore necessary to alter the state of thebody.In the Afro-Caribbean tradition, this altering of the body's autonomic systems can beeffected through the use of drums. Drums exert a control over the heartbeat of thedevotees, which is one of the autonomic processes. In this situation, the drummerscontrol the psycho-biological response of an entire group of devotees, and it is withinthis highly-charged environment that the phenomenon of possession by the gods takesplace, often in multiple devotees. The type of drums used and the rhythms employedwill change the results, invoking specific deities. But the drumming still takes placewithin the greater context of the ritual itself, which is under the control of the priest.These methods—while they can cause change to occur in and of themselves—must beused within the ritual structure in order to be effective. Anyone can take drugs or"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"alcohol, for instance, but although the senses may be deranged as a result, the long-term effects will not be conducive to the attainment of spiritual illumination or occultcapabilities. As we have already indicated, sexual activity by itself is not capable ofproducing the type of spiritual breakthroughs of which the writings of Grant, Crowley,and the entire field of the Tantras are an indication. What is necessary is the deliberatestructure of the ritual, for that is where the effect of the Will will be felt and that iswhat will provide the channel for the energy raised. As the Crowleyan imperative hasit, “love under will.”There is no guarantee that the experience will be pleasant or productive. The ritualstructure will provide a certain level of operational security if the ritual participantshave been prepared carefully beforehand. This preparation is not only in terms ofyogic-type practices, meditation, etc. but also intellectual study so that the variousmoving parts of the ritual are understood and made part of the psyches of theparticipants. In other words, the various techniques used to insure protection must beinternalized so that they are second-nature. The instinctual response of the individualsto perceived danger is what will protect them, since there is no physical weapon thatcan be used to defeat what is essentially an ethereal or at least non-corporeal threat.The mind will be forced to locate the appropriate defense mechanism—for instance,during a confrontation with an entity from the Mauve Zone that appears hostile orsomehow dangerous—and the only weapons at its disposal will be those learned in thepreliminary phase of the training.Even then, however, the effects of such intense ritual workings may be felt for days,weeks, or even years after the fact as the experience is digested and connections toother—unconscious—material is strengthened. That is why such an experiencedoccultist as Francis Israel Regardie—a one-time secretary to Aleister Crowley and aGolden Dawn and Rosicrucian initiate—strongly recommended that those interested inentering onto a path of occult practice first go through several years of psychologicalanalysis in order to identify as much as possible any deeply hidden problems thatwould be inadvertently triggered or exacerbated by occult practice.To Grant, who experienced most of the twentieth century and the first decade of thetwenty-first, the enormous changes that took place during that time were an indicationthat something had gone terribly wrong with the cosmos. Grant believed that the typeof changes a magician effects on his own psyche as a result of his occult practice canhave an impact on the world at large. This is, after all, the whole basis of magic as asystem for manipulating reality and the experience of reality. Grant's thesis is that thepresent state of affairs is the result of an accumulation of occult operations on the onehand (acting on the ethereal plane, perhaps), and scientific, social, and technologicaloperations on the other operating in the “real” world.Today we hear of sights and sounds experienced outside the body, in the skies,in the oceans, and deep within the earth. It is as if a cosmic Fire Snake activated"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"the terrestrial power-zones, or reflected into space the chakras awakened by sub-atomic radiations. ... the Earth is beginning to exhibit the catastrophic effects ofsuch artificial stimulations of the Fire Snake.185When Grant writes “as if” he is being coy, for it is clear that he believes this isprecisely what happened. One must read Grant carefully with a view towardsextrapolating some of the broader statements from the minutiae of sexual rituals andHebrew, Greek and even English gematria. His clearest paragraphs are those thatreveal his certainty that the stories of H. P. Lovecraft, the art of the Surrealists and ofAustin Osman Spare, and the modern phenomena of UFOs and abductees, are all in asense reflections of a real universe beyond our own. His incorporation of Tantra,Kabbalah, magic, and all the rest can be seen as an attempt to reconcile his deeper,inner belief in the reality of the horror fantasies of Lovecraft with a comprehensiveworldview that could explain them in some kind of internally-consistent way.Grant clearly believed that the world was undergoing an invasion from some otherdimension or from somewhere Beyond. This invasion was being experienced as theUFO phenomenon, among other things. The eruption of interest in occultism, horrorfilms, alternative religions, etc. indicated to Grant that something was already workingits way into our world and that the only ones who could interpret this event were thesensitives. Not limited to magicians or occultists, sensitives include artists, writers,and other people who deal extensively with imagination and creativity: qualities thatare associated with the Mauve Zone. In this Grant takes his cue from Lovecraft, ofcourse, but that doesn't make his conclusions any less reasonable.In present times, with the massive reawakening in man of the subtle facultiesconnected with the Ajna-Vishuddha complex of chakras, a more sinister elementpervades the picture. Man is no longer subject only to his innate tendencies, hisorganism has undergone changes which render him increasingly susceptible toinfluences from Outside. ... Whatever ‘it’ is, or whatever its provenance, it posesserious problems for the magician. Alien intelligence is intimately involvedwith the movements of the Fire Snake, the energies of which are known to beinteractive with the denizens of other dimensions.186At the same time, there are occultists who are deliberately attempting to makecontact with these beings from other dimensions, other worlds, through the medium ofthe Mauve Zone, and they included the membership of his own occult lodge in London.These contacts did not stop when his lodge ceased activity in the 1960s, however, forhe writes:... there are today magicians who are forging links with power-zones inunfathomable space and with voids beyond time.187Again, we can clearly recognize the Lovecraftian influence in Grant's vision. Grant"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"specifically links Cthulhu with the Fire Snake, i.e. with Kundalini, as it is asleep in thewaters of the deep (which Grant links to the two lowest chakras, the muladhara andsvadisthana chakras)188 and can be raised by the right evocations and when the “starsare right.” To support this, he also quotes frequently from the Schlangekraft recensionof the Necronomicon.It is quite possible that the famous Lovecraftian description of Cthulhu as “dead butdreaming” indicates Kundalini which is asleep until it is awakened, but also refers toGrant's three forms of consciousness: awake, dreaming, and dreamless sleep. Cthulhu,as “dead but dreaming” seems to refer to a realm between “death”—dreamless sleep—and dreams: in other words, the Mauve Zone. Kundalini is also a Serpent, anamphibious creature that could be linked with Cthulhu. A Serpent in her cave beneaththe earth; Cthulhu in his house beneath the sea. Both raised by magicians and occultpractice and, when they do, they change our world forever.This is the point at which Grant makes a rather astonishing claim, among manyastonishing claims. He begins a story that sounds like something out of a fantasymagazine yet later insists that it is not metaphor but an account of a real event thatoccurred “recently” (Beyond the Mauve Zone was published in 1999). It contains muchthat is only comprehensible if the previous material we have discussed is understood.In this tale, Grant references an Order that exists in the present Indian state ofAssam. This Order is Tantric and initiates into the type of Tantra we have beendiscussing. He links this Order to “stray references” found in the Necronomicon,among other places, and says it represents an oral tradition spanning generations. TheOrder at some point created or contacted or somehow incarnated an Entity from therealm of what Grant calls “transplutonic Isis”: a star not necessarily in our dimension,but one from which Grant's Nu-Isis or New Isis Lodge obtained its heritage and legacy.The Entity dwelled on the Earth during which time “more and more women gavebirth to offspring imbued with the ‘child's’ alien propensities. ... Many earth-dwellersexperience strange dreams and horrendous nightmares in which they glimpse thefantastic force of their own terror.”189 Eventually, our planet became a “far-flungoutpost of Nu-Isis.”190But that is not the end of the story. Eventually, the Entity spends “many years inAssam studying with a Tantric Adept” after which they both disappear, only to“surface” in a network of tunnels underneath Kamrup which Grant calls “the terrestrialpower-zone of the Fire Snake.” The Entity then assumes the identity of an eccentricscientist—I am not making this up—who has an image of Nu-Isis in a cabinet beforewhich burns an eternal flame. The image was of a woman, “suave, metallic, her bodycast in vitrified ojas ...” and at a particular time the image comes to life and thescientist “cohabited regularly” with this “alien embodiment of the Fire Snake” until anexplosion destroyed the scientist's laboratory and “the surrounding terrain was"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"violently upheaved by the impact of a series of elemental disasters.”191 However, allwas not lost for a daughter had been born out of the cohabiting of the scientist with thestatue—although she seems somewhat unpleasant.After this, Grant writes that it is not a magical allegory but an account of the “recentastral history of the earth.”192Let us take a moment to deconstruct the narrative, for it will yield some fascinatingfruits.In the first place, Assam is considered by some historians to have been thebirthplace of Tantra. It is located on the far north-eastern end of India connected to therest of the sub-continent by a narrow pass throught the mountains. Its ancient namewas Kamrup, and it represented an independent kingdom bordering on Tibet. Grantidentifies Kamrup as the ancient capital of Assam, but that is not technically true asKamrup was the name of the entire kingdom (now a district of Assam).It is the story of the eccentric and reclusive scientist, however, that is intriguing fora number of reasons.In the 1930s H. P. Lovecraft went to Florida to visit Robert Barlow, a young manwho was an aspiring writer. They had developed a friendship through correspondence,and Barlow was thrilled to have his idol come down from Rhode Island to see him inthe Sunshine State. After visiting Barlow in De Land, Volusia County, Lovecraft wentdown to Key West. This first visit was in May—June of 1931. There were several othertrips to Florida thereafter.However, this visit to Key West opens up a number of intriguing possibilities. Atthat time, there was a strange, eccentric and reclusive scientist living in Key West,moreover someone who had been involved in the occult back in his native Germany,and who had spent time in India studying with gurus before eventually winding up inAustralia at the beginning of the First World War. Significantly, he befriended a SriLankan monk who was a friend of Crowley's mentor, Alan Bennett.His story was one of the most bizarre episodes in Florida (or any state's) history.The man was known variously as Count Carl von Cosel, or Carl Tanzler, or Georg KarlTänzler (1877-1952).Tanzler was born in Dresden, Germany, and according to a lengthy article he hadwritten for Fantastic Adventures magazine, he had paranormal experiences since hewas a young man living in his family's castle. He had recurring visions of a lovelywoman—a famous ancestor—and another vision of a woman whom he called byvarious names, including Ayesha. But these were incorporeal women and disappearedas soon as he was aware of them. Fearing he was being haunted, he contacted severalimportant paranormal experts in the region around Dresden.These included names that are perhaps not as well known today, but were famous intheir time. In the list were Carl du Prel (1839-1899), J. K. F. Zöllner (1834-1882) and"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Carl Kiesewetter (1854-1895) among many others. The problem with Tanzler's list isthat most of these men would have been dead by the time he was having hisexperiences. In fact, du Prel died at the age of sixty and would have been alive at thetime Tanzler was having his strange visions, but Zöllner would have died when Tanzlerwhen was only five years old, and Kiesewetter would have died when Tanzler was onlyeighteen. According to Tanzler's own account he was 20 years old when he asked thesevenerable gentlemen to assist him in his confusion. So it seems Tanzler was not beingcompletely honest in compiling this list in an article published in September, 1947.Eventually he left Germany for a tour to Asia, stopping first in Italy where he hadanother strong vision of this ethereal woman, Ayesha. Then at some point before theoutset of World War One Tanzler found himself in India.In that country, where he claimed he was studying Indian religion, he woke up oneday to find himself in a morgue. Evidently something had gone wrong with one of hismeditations and the local people thought he had died.From India, he went to Australia where he was interned during the War even thoughhe had become a naturalized British citizen. While he was in the internment camp, hemade the acquaintance of a Sri Lanken monk named Nyanatiloka Thera. This particularmonk was a friend of Crowley's mentor Alan Bennett when the latter was known as theBhikku Ananda Metteya. The two monks lived in the same ashram for a period of time.From there, Tanzler went back to Germany after the end of the war and wasencouraged by his family to emigrate to the United States. He stayed in Germany from1920-1925, the period that saw the collapse of German society due to their loss of thewar, the Depression, and the rise of Nazism with the famous Beer Hall Putsch of 1923.In April, 1926 he arrived in the United States and moved first to Zephyrhills, Floridaand then to Key West where he found work as a radiologist in 1927.On April 22, 1930 he met a young woman, a tuberculosis patient by the name ofMaria Elena Milagro de Hoyos. She was a twenty-one-year-old Cuban-Americanwoman and a local beauty. Tanzler recognized her as the woman in the visions he hadbeen having all his life, and fell in love with her. He courted her even though they wereboth married to other people. He tried various means to cure her of her illness, andclaimed to have made good progress. But her family intervened. They did not want herseeing this self-professed medical man, but instead insisted that she return to thehospital and do whatever the regular doctors told her to do.Maria Hoyos died on October 25, 1931. That should have been the end of the story,but things became increasingly strange after that.Tanzler built her an elaborate mausoleum in the local cemetery, one to which healone would have the key. While visiting her constantly he began a series of bizarremedical procedures designed first to keep her from decomposing, and then to raise herfrom the dead. In fact, as far as Tanzler was concerned, she was not really dead at all.The story of how he attended to her is told in great detail in the Fantastic"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Adventures article, but suffice it to say that he claimed his ministrations weresuccessful. Maria Elena was able to open her eyes, move her limbs, and speak. Tanzlerkept several IVs pumping fluids into her body and removing other fluids and fighting aconstant battle with maggots, but in the end he was certain that he was successful inbringing her back to life.It was only a hurricane—Grant's “elemental disasters”—that disrupted Tanzler'soperation. He was forced to take Maria Elena's body out of the mausoleum in the deadof night and bring it to his home—where he built a special cabinet for her (in the shapeof an aircraft ... Tanzler had been making preparations to fly them both out of Floridaas soon as she was “well enough” to make the trip).Eventually, however, he was discovered by members of the young woman's family.This was in October, 1940. That means almost ten years after her death. Tanzler hadbeen living with the corpse in his house and—according to some accounts—“cohabiting” with it—all that time.He was arrested but the charges were dropped due to the expiration of the statute oflimitations for corpse-tampering. Maria Elena's body was buried in an unmarked graveand Tanzler, who could no longer stay in Key West due to the notoriety, moved back tothe Zephyrhills area and then eventually wrote the story that appeared in FantasticAdventures.We have one certain indication, other than Tanzler's own insistence, that he wasinvolved with the occult long these events transpired. He wrote an article about hisexperience in the Australian internment camp for none other than the RosicrucianDigest, published in March, 1939. This was before his arrest, but years after the deathof Maria Elena Milagro (“miracle”) de Hoyos. When he finally died in 1952, he wasfound with a life-size effigy of Ms. de Hoyos.Some dreams never die.There are so many coincidences between this story and the one told by Grant inBeyond the Mauve Zone that we are forced to consider the possibility that they are oneand the same. Add to this the idea that Lovecraft almost certainly knew of this story—it would have appealed to him immensely—and one wonders if it could have inspiredhis famous story “Herbet West—Re-Animator” (1921-1922) except this tale waswritten ten years before the events in question, while Tanzler was still in Germany.Another case of Lovecraft seeing into the future?Tanzler does not refer to any German or American occult orders or initiations in hisfew autobiographical writings. He seems to have belonged to AMORC—the publisherof the Rosicrucian Digest—and he claims to have lived for awhile in India (somewherein the period from about 1912-1914 or so) and studied yoga and Indian mysticism. Hisclose friendship with one of Alan Bennett's fellow monks is also intriguing, but in theend we do not have much more information than that.Was Tanzler a member of any occult lodge or secret society? We can't answer that"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"for sure, but his account of how he tended to the corpse of his beloved Maria Elena hasall the hallmarks of an occult operation and seems to fit some of the details given byGrant—who may have heard the story from someone else. The interesting detail givenin Grant and not in Tanzler is the existence of a “child,” a daughter (presumably non-human) born out of this unholy wedlock. Depending on how Tanzler was “cohabiting”with her corpse—if there were Tantric elements involved—Grant could have beenrevealing some privileged knowledge about the case.The woman that Tanzler kept seeing he identified at one point as a priestess namedAyesha. Ayesha then materialized in the form of Maria Elena, who then died fromtuberculosis before they could be married. Tuberculosis, of course, is the illness mostassociated with popular ideas about vampirism: the condition of a corpse who has diedof TB bears resemblance to ideas about vampires, and as someone wastes away fromthe disease they exhibit all the symptoms popularly associated with having their bloodsucked from their bodies.There is much to work with here, indeed, and perhaps one day we will come a littlecloser to understanding what really motivated Tanzler—an otherwise responsible,scientific-minded German, a world-traveler, a man of at least three nationalities (hisnative German, plus his naturalized British then his naturalized Americancitizenships), friend of monks and practitioner of Asian mysticism, and even memberof a Rosicrucian group.But what brings it all together is sexual magic.Sexuality is the key that opens the Gate to the Mauve Zone. That does not necessarilymean that sexual intercourse within a ritual setting is the only way this can be done.Instead, other methods of awakening the Fire Snake may be employed, includingpurely passive methods such as meditation and yoga, as well as the other means of“deranging the senses” that are available, from drugs to drumming. Systems thatinvolve the autonomic nervous system directly are the easiest—i.e., fastest—way toaccomplish this goal, but they are also (obviously) the most dangerous. Tantric expertsinsist that no self-initiation in Tantra is possible; that one should always seek the helpand training of a qualified guru. The problem with this advice, as good as it is, is thatso many gurus have been exposed as dangerous themselves, or at least as unreliableand corrupt. Thus, many seekers have fallen back on self-initiation as the only possibleway, not realizing that this path may be at least as dangerous as following a falseteacher.The sorcerers that populate Lovecraft's works often work in groups. There was theorgiastic cult in “The Call of Cthulhu,” and the devil-worshippers in “The Thing on theDoorstep,” as well as the Starry Wisdom cult, and the Dagon worshippers in “TheShadow Over Innsmouth.” But there were also solitary practitioners, such as OldWhateley in “The Dunwich Horror.” What connected all of these disparate characters"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"was the Tradition itself.Lovecraft's Weltanschauung is fairly consistent. There was an ancient race frombeyond the stars who visited or populated the Earth at some vastly distant time, butwhose devotees still exist in the world, usually intent on bringing back the Old Ones torule the Earth again. Alternatively, there are ancient texts found by independentsorcerers—texts like the Necronomicon—that provide formulas for evoking theseseemingly unpleasant creatures from their extra-dimensional, supramundane homes forreasons that are hard to fathom. No one really knows why Old Whateley wanted tobring down one of these creatures to impregnate his own daughter. No one reallyexplains why these cults in the swamps outside New Orleans would want Cthulhu toawaken from his million-years-slumber. It seems to be understood, if unspoken, thatthere exists in some human beings a deep desire to experience what is on the other sideof the great divide that separates us from true knowledge; that the experience of theoccult is addictive; and that contact with beings from “other worlds” may bescientifically impossible or unproveable, but nonetheless real to those who have hadthat contact—for it changes their lives forever.Many people have experiences that can be described as paranormal or otherworldly.No matter how much scientific minds try to explain these experiences away usingperfectly rational arguments, the emotional content of these experiences remainstronger than the best common-sense explanation. The occultist makes a deliberateattempt to have as many of these experiences as possible, in a controlled environmentand under repeatable circumstances. The approach to these paranormal or otherworldlyexperiences is a carefully-constructed one. It often has as its purpose the attainment ofsuperior knowledge and ability, or the acquisition of paranormal powers. This has thepotential to derange the average person.The human psycho-biological organism has been trained for survival. Every actionmust be understood as somehow promoting that need. When actions do not make senseas survival strategies—such as ritual magic, and other processes deemed“retroversions” of the survival instinct—then the organism is stressed. It finds itselfforced to come up with a rationale for these actions. If the occultist is not well-trained,then the psyche is vulnerable to the effects of deep-seated psychoses and the mind canfind itself obsessed or even a bit more deranged than even Rimbaud would becomfortable experiencing.While this can occur in an individual—and it does, with more regularity than onemight believe—the effects have wider consequences. When an occult ritual goes awrywith even the most competent magician—with side effects that Kenneth Grant refers toas “tangential tantrums”193—then the results can be felt in the immediateenvironment. Strange phenomena occur, some banal, others weirdly compelling,experienced by non-occultists as well as those with a vested interest in the outcome ofthe ritual."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"This is the Mauve Zone making itself felt through a rent in the veil that separates itfrom the “real world,” something about which the Schlangekraft recension of theNecronomicon warns us when it insists that we close the Gate lest something creepthrough when we are unaware. This is also consistent with medieval attitudes towardsdemonic conjuration, when the correct construction of the magic circle is required andits physical integrity insisted upon. The circle is the Gate the magician uses to ventureinto the Mauve Zone; it is also the wall that he erects between himself and the entitiesthat live there.One of the requirements of both Tantra and magic is that one's partners in the ritualsbe selected carefully beforehand. There are numerous examples given in the Tantras ofthe correct type of priestess; the grimoires of magic are rather less clear on the subject,but it is nevertheless an important factor. One can control one's own actions during theritual; it is much more difficult to do that and to control the actions and reactions ofothers, whether the priestess in a rite of maithuna, or assistants in a ritual ofceremonial magic.It was quite likely this particular problem led to one of the most famous—andinfluential—rituals of modern times. It involved one of Crowley's most brilliantdisciples, a man who was literally a rocket scientist. It ended in the destruction of themagician on the one hand and the creation of a new cult on the other.No discussion of the Mauve Zone would be complete without reference to the exampleof John Whiteside Parsons (1914-1952): an example of how an occult life can goterribly wrong and yet still contribute so much.We are used to the example of famous artists and writers being car wrecks as humanbeings. Edgar Allan Poe is one example, a brilliant author and poet who was analcoholic and who died in a gutter. Vincent Van Gogh is another, as are any number ofmodern rock stars. Hemingway committed suicide.Some of Lovecraft's inner circle can be included, such as the creator of Conan, theBarbarian: Robert E. Howard who committed suicide at a young age. And Lovecraft'sown literary executor, the brilliant scholar Robert Barlow, committed suicide inMexico on January 2, 1951 when he was still a young man in his thirties.The artistic life can have that effect on people. Too close contact with the MauveZone, over too long and extended a period of time, is poisonous if it is not controlled.Once that Gate is opened it must be constantly policed, and closed if the threat levelrises.Therefore, in the occult world there are similar lists.One of the most important names on that list is Jack Parsons.His story has been told in several places and we won't go into too much detail here.He was a rocket scientist who made an important contribution to the war effort in the1940s, and was a founding member of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Most famously,"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"he has a crater on the Moon named after him: a fact that should be of some importanceto those who follow the Kaula path, for Parsons was also a magician and a follower ofAleister Crowley. For a time he ran the only active OTO lodge in the United States, inPasadena, California. It was probably due to this, and to several unlucky friendships,that he eventually lost his all-important security clearance and subsequently had a hardtime finding work. It was the Cold War, and paranoia about crazy California occultistsran about as high as it did for crazy California communists.In June of 1952, at the age of thirty-eight, Parsons blew himself up in a garageoutside his home. Opinions differ as to whether it was an accident, a suicide, or amurder. There is room for all three versions.But it was in 1946 that everything changed.Parsons had met a science-fiction author and Naval officer named L. Ron Hubbardas the war came to a close. Parsons had run a kind of salon out of his home for writersand for people interested in the occult. Hubbard had heard of it, and began frequentingthe home, meeting Parsons and developing a close relationship with him. Hubbard'sbackground was sketchy. Declassified FBI files on Hubbard tell a story that issomewhat at odds with the official version promoted by Hubbard's creature, the“religion” known as Scientology.Regardless, from January to March, 1946, Parsons enlisted the assistance ofHubbard in a series of ambitious magical rituals known as the Babalon Working. Thegoal was to summon or incarnate the Scarlet Woman herself with a view towardscreating a “magical child.” The inspiration for this manouver was evidently Crowley'snovel, Moonchild, which we have already referenced. The method was consistent withCrowleyan sex-magical techniques, such as we have been discussing at length in thesepages, and the result—at least, according to Grant—was predictable.At the completion of the first part of the ritual, a red-headed woman—MarjorieCameron—appeared at Parsons's home, waiting for him as he returned from the ritualin the desert. Parsons took this to be a sign that the ritual had been successful, for theScarlet Woman is famously a red-head. They soon formed a relationship and married.The next phase of the ritual was to use IXth degree OTO sex magic rituals in order toincarnate a magical child who would be the Thelemic messiah.A study of this event is instructive for anyone who has managed to follow this reportthus far. Everything we have been discussing comes together in the story of Parsonsand Hubbard and the Babalon Working, from Thelema to the OTO, sex magic,Babalon, creating magical offspring ... and opening a Gate that perhaps should neverhave been opened.Hubbard's agenda in all of this is a mystery, except that in the end he made off witha great deal of Parsons's money in a venture called Allied Enterprises. Hubbardabsconded with the funds to Florida (and Parsons's former girlfriend Sara Northrup)where he bought a boat and tried to escape. According to the story as it has been told"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"many times, Parsons chased Hubbard to Florida and when he saw that his formerpartner making for open waters, he conjured a spirit to raise a tempest and force theship back to shore ... and that is exactly what happened. Hubbard was detained by theCoast Guard and told by the court to repay the money he had stolen from Parsons.Within a few short years, Hubbard would write Dianetics—the book for which he isbest known—and began the creation of what would become Scientology. In the earlyyears of the movement he would often claim to have met Aleister Crowley and topraise him in speeches and talks he gave to his followers. Later, he would drop allreferences to Crowley and downplay his involvement with the Parsons lodge of theOTO.One thing, however, seems to be agreed upon by those who study the case, and thatis that the rituals performed by Parsons, Hubbard and Marjorie Cameron wereeffective, but in ways no one had expected or planned. The common analysis has it thatthe rituals “blew a hole in the space-time continuum” through which ... something ...came in.The rituals took place from January to March, 1946. Parsons wrote the text that heclaimed was the “fourth chapter” of the Book of the Law, The Book of Babalon. ByJune, 1947, the UFO phenomenon had begun with the Kenneth Arnold “flying saucer”sightings, and the Roswell incident the following month. The Dead Sea Scrolls werediscovered that year, and the CIA was founded in the Fall.And on December 1, 1947, the Great Beast himself, Therion, Aleister Crowley theProphet of the New Aeon, died at his home in England.Kenneth Grant, who had been studying with Crowley in 1945, was at the Beast'sfuneral and later worked closely with John Symonds, one of Crowley's literaryexecutors. He became involved with the OTO and by 1955 his Nu Isis Lodge began theintense workings that became the basis for his Typhonian Trilogies. He would focus onsex magic, and on the concept that a Gate could be opened between this world and thenext by the experienced or capable magician.His group worked with fiction—short stories and novels—as magical environments,which was an inspired strategy. What difference is there, after all, between thenarrative we find in fiction and that which we find in the myths and legends that makeup scriptures and Tantras? If a story works—if it conveys a truth, elicits an emotionalresponse, tells us something we did not know before and allows us to own thatsomething—then it has much the same function as a scriptural text. The first dramaswere religious in nature; the first theatrical performances were rituals. It was throughthis direct experience of working with fiction to provide ritual elements that Grant andhis lodge came to realize that inspired fiction was as legitimate a source of occultknowledge and technique as sacred texts.Science fiction authors have made contributions to science, such as Arthur C.

Fantasy andhorror authors make (unconscious) contributions to occultism and magic byidentifying information at deep levels of the human psyche. By focusing on fear andhorror, these authors directly address our most hidden nature, which is another way ofsaying that they open a Gate into the Mauve Zone.182 Kenneth Grant, Beyond the Mauve Zone, p. 57.183 Technically speaking, the prefix “an-” would seem to indicate that anuttara (an-uttara) is a negative orcomparative term, most likely indicating “not surpassed” or “unsurpassable” rather than a positive term such as“absolute” or “highest,” but the sense is more or less the same.184 A marma is the point where three lines intersect on the Sri Chakra. There are traditionally 28 marmas, butsome authorities insist on variously 37, 38, 39, 40 or 41 such marmas depending on how they are calculated. Thesandhis are the points where two lines intersect. There are traditionally 24 sandhis in the Sri Chakra. The sum ofthese numbers—28 + 24—gives us the 52 letters of the Sanskrit alphabet and thus a kind of Kabbalistic format thatcould be used to create (or analyze, or diagram) mantras.185 Kenneth Grant, Beyond the Mauve Zone, p. 70.186 Ibid., p. 60.187 Ibid., p. 80.188 Ibid., p. 58.189 Ibid., p. 133-134.190 Ibid., p. 134.191 Ibid., p. 134-135.192 Ibid., p. 135193 Kenneth Grant, Beyond the Mauve Zone, p. 77 and in Grant's Hecate's Fountain."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTHE DARK LORD... when the world was destroyed by fire on 21st March, 1904, one's attentionwas inevitably called to the similarity of this card to the Stele of Revealing. ...This being the beginning of the New Aeon ...—Aleister Crowley, The Book of ThothMy father died in 1904, but without any message to leave to me, or to my onlychild ... it was this boy who reversed the order of family information ...—H.

This had to bewitnessed by other initiates in order to pass the test.Contact with non-human entities is one of the inescapable requirements of magic.There is no magic without this type of supramundane communication. And the mostintense form of this contact is sexual.Those who have been inadvertently or unwillingly involved in this type of encounterspeak of it in sexual terms. The UFO abductee experience seems to include varioustypes of (often uncomfortable) sexual encounter with alien beings. In the Middle Agesaverage men and women complained about incubi and succubi. The Witches' Sabbat isportrayed as a kind of orgy. Lovecraft's aversion to sexuality may be a reflection ofthis unconscious understanding that, somehow, sexuality and contact with alien forcesare linked.This is the basis for what we have learned of the Typhonian Tradition.In a Typhonian Order newsletter published in Miami, Florida in the 1990s we findthe bold statement:The central concern of Magick is communion with discarnate or extraterrestrialIntelligences.194"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"This is characterized by Grant as the “occult policy of the OTO”195 and it more orless throws down the gauntlet. There is no insistence on lofty spiritual goals or anAsian-inspired quest for non-duality or nirvana. While these are certainly present inGrant's works they are there almost as after-thoughts. After all we have read—and ithas been only a drop in the Typhonian bucket—we know that this “policy” ofcommunion with discarnate and extraterrestrial Intelligences involves some form ofsexual magic or Tantra.Why is this specifically Typhonian, then? After all, Crowley's Thelema alsoinvolves sexual techniques and is not characterized as Typhonian. Grant is clear on thedifference between the two approaches. Grant's magic is stellar-based, while themainstream of Thelema is solar-based. His emphasis is not so much on Horus as it ison Set, and he is willing to accept input from sources as diverse as Jack Parsons, FraterAchad, and even H. P. Lovecraft. He is reaching for a greater scope for Thelema andbelieves that this is achievable through the operations of ceremonial magic with sexualor Tantric enhancements conducted as a series of experiments to gather more, anddeeper, information about the nature of our universe. This universe is not perceived asthe visible solar system and the star systems outside of it alone, but as that universeplus other dimensions, other realities beyond the ones we see or measure with ourconscious minds.Tantra deals with enormous lengths of time, elaborate cosmological systems, and anintense intellectual component—but viewed from within a worldview that states thecosmos was created by means of a sexual act between the gods, and that therefore theentire created universe reflects that sexual polarity. The power that fuels the universehas its analogue in sexual energy. Our bodies contain the source of this energy, the FireSnake—dead but dreaming—at the base of our spines; and as individual as this seemsit is also universal. The Kundalini coiled at the base of my spine is identical to that atthe base of yours, and they are both identical to that at the base of the spine of theUniverse (the body of the Mother Goddess), which is identical to that at the base of thespines of the gods themselves. It is a machine, a technology, that bridges the gapbetween science and religion, between mind and body, between reality and the Other.Sexuality is an ancient metaphor for this power. It crosses cultural, racial andreligious lines. Sexual spirituality can be seen in the occult practices of China, India,Southeast Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Europe. Fertility rites havebeen observed among pre-literate societies the world over, and painted on cave wallsdating back thousands of years. This is the “apostolic succession” of the TyphonianTradition.Using sources as diverse as de Santillana and von Dechend's Hamlet's Mill, as wellas the more fanciful projects of Zecharia Sitchin and Erich von Danniken, we can seethat a stellar—rather than a solar—tradition is the oldest form of occult theory andpractice.

The venerable astrological system of India—Vedic orJyotish astrology—is sidereal-based and not solar-based. There is a definite Currentthat involves this tradition, and with it we can begin to re-evaluate some of the historywe think we know about such groups as the cult of Mithra—which this author insistswas an astral and not a solar cult.Truly, it is written that “Every man and every woman is a star,” not a sun or even amoon. Much of what Crowley wrote is intelligble from a stellar or astral perspective asopposed to a purely “solar-phallic” one. Some of Grant's criticisms of Crowley'sapproach to magic are legitimate; that does not mean that Crowley's Thelema has beensomehow devalued in the process. It can only benefit from constructive ideas and theexpansion of its theory and practice into new, uncharted territories. Yet, any criticismof Crowley is considered anathema in some quarters, and those with lesser initiationsfeel unequal to the task of questioning either Crowley himself or his (appointed orunappointed) heirs.So what is needed is the Dark Lord.Set is the Opponent, the Adversary (like his Christian avatar, Satan). It is the role ofSet to set himself up in opposition to the status quo, to the consensus viewpoint, totraditional beliefs and practices. He is the Other, and as such represents alien conceptsand methods. Just as the Elixir Vitae is formed of both the male and female elements,and just as the Aeon of Horus is the Aeon of the Magical Child—the offspring of thoseelements—so too Set is the polarity required by Horus to balance the new religion andbring it into greater recognition.... And to contribute to the birth of new—non-human—offspring.In the Catholic Church, there is the role of the Devil's Advocate. This individual isthere to question every aspect of the life of a person being considered for canonizationas a Saint. While he works for the Church, his job is to try as hard as he can tochallenge and defeat those who would support the canonization. Set's role is similar,but much more far-reaching.Set is the avatar of all such Devil's Advocates. He is, in fact, the Devil himselfaccording to some traditions. He is the Dark Lord, the “dark” at the end of the Tunnelsof Set. He represents all that humanity has suppressed, repressed, and oppressed sincetime immemorial. There is no Aeon of Set, for Set is not relegated to a solar period, anequinoctial precession, or any kind of calendar. He cannot be contained that way. Set'sposition in the heavens is as the Pole Star or, at least, as the circumpolar asterism weknow as the Big Dipper, but which the ancient Egyptians recognized as the Thigh ofSet: the all-important device made of magnetic iron—Lovecraft's “Tutulu metal”—that “opened the mouth” of the mummy, of the corpse, of the re-animated God.Set is polymorphously perverse.

Shiva is theLord of Destruction, with Brahma (Lord of Creation) and Vishnu (Lord ofPreservation) forming a holy Sanskrit Trinity. Set spilled his seed, and so did Shiva.Set comes from the stars.

And the human unconscious is the gateway to all the other zonesof reality that comprise the magician's neighborhood. He's in deep, but that's becausewe've put him there. If human beings are social animals, and need society to feel safeand comfortable and to sleep their way through existence, then Set needs to besuppressed. And when Set is suppressed, then everything connected to Set issuppressed. And that's how most of us live.It's not a very magical approach to life.But it's safe.Let's look at the 24th Tunnel of Set, that known as Niantiel.Kenneth Grant describes what was seen on a tour of this Tunnel, this scary backalley on the Tree of Life. And it's not pretty.It's about a Death Cult whose members “became addicted to necrophilia.” The ritualinvolves sex with a “ritually slain woman dedicated to the deity with whom contactwas sought.” As we have learned, the occult policy of Grant's Typhonian Order iscontact with discarnate Intelligences, and in this case, both the Intelligence and theVehicle are discarnate. According to Grant, virgins were kept especially “sequestered”for these rituals. Once slain, sex with the corpse was almost immediate as the astralform of the slain woman was sent to a realm between earthly and “post-mortemconsciousness.” All of this was to enable the magicians to use the freshly-liberatedspirit of the victim to travel to the desired realm and communicate what she saw backto the cult.196This is a form of necromancy, and versions of it exist in many cultures. Contact withthe dead is tabu in many religions and sexual congress with a corpse is especiallyheinous.197 However, the Tantric rites that take place in cremation grounds in Indiacome pretty close to this example. Sexual congress—maithuna—can take place in thepresence of a corpse, and not necessarily one that has died recently. To a true Tantrikathere would be nothing inherently objectionable about having sex with a corpse asnothing is hideous to the truly enlightened. There are many Tantric ikons that depictKali, for instance, dripping in blood and skulls, standing on the corpse of Shiva.

(I have alreadydiscussed this in Tantric Temples.) The motivation is probably the same: todemonstrate that there are no “bad” substances, no “ugliness” in the world, but that allis a manifestation of the Goddess, and there is no purpose in prefering one substanceover any other.After all, even the Bible tells us that “the Stone the builders rejected was thecornerstone.” (Psalm 118:22; Acts 4:11)This ugly substance, this forbidden act, this rejected Stone ... all can be understoodas relics of the Dark Lord.The problem with the scene depicted as having taken place in the Tunnel of Setknown as Niantiel is that a woman was slain for the purpose of contacting the OldOnes. Everything else would be permissible to a Tantric Adept, in our world, exceptmurder and human sacrifice.Except ... except ... it has been known to occur. Human sacrifice was not unknown tothe various Tantric sects of India, Tibet, and even Southeast Asia. Tantra is aboutpower, about shakti, and there have been Tantric kings who coveted the powerrepresented by the Goddess Kundali and who applied that arcane knowledge to theworld of politics and government. Kings have never been squeamish about killingpeople; add a religious or occult justification and it just makes it easier.The kapala—the human skulls used as sacrificial vessels in the more shamanistic ofthe Tibetan Buddhist rituals—were sometimes selected from appropriate victims whilethey were still alive and using them. The requirements for these skulls are complex andspecific; there was no way one came across an appropriate skull by accident. It had tobe by design. The same for the skulls to be used for the damaru, the ritual drums. Andthe care and preservation of these skulls was also a matter of some concern. The bestway to keep the skulls from drying out was to rub them with fat; the best fat was thatobtained from the cremation grounds.201We know that human sacrifice, sometimes on a large scale, did exist in various partsof the world. The Aztecs were famous for massive sacrificial events.

His power rests in the things we have hiddenfrom ourselves; and, yes, sexuality is one path that brings us before his throne in thesunken city. But he must be approached with care, and with caution.Otherwise the Dark Lord will fuck you up.The Typhonian Tradition is ancient, according to Grant. This is not so unbelievableas it appears. As Ioan Couliano tells us:... witchcraft was still practiced in certain zones of eastern Europe at the end ofthe nineteenth century as a direct derivative of shamanism. Beliefs recorded inPaleosiberian caves around 1000 BCE were still valid less than a hundred yearsago. How can we explain such amazing continuity? ... a simple set of ruleswould generate similar results in the minds of human beings for a virtuallyinfinite period of time.202This perfectly accords with the writings of Grant who does not insist that hisdiscoveries came from a long line of initiates stretching unbroken back to the StoneAge or beyond. What he does say is that the Typhonian Tradition itself is ancient, andthat there have been bodies of adepts at various times in various places who have eitherkept the Tradition alive, or who have rediscovered it and breathed new life into it. The“simple set of rules” is what counts, and those of the Typhonian Tradition arestraightforward and reflect a preoccupation with darkness, danger, and the systematicand deliberate transgression of social and religious tabus.But that is a psychological and anthropological perspective on the Tradition, whichmay satisfy some but which does not tell the whole story. Eventually, psychologicaland anthropological ideas go out of fashion and change with the times. New ideologies,new trends in intellectual pursuits mean that we keep looking at the same materialfrom the point of view of where we are standing at the time.The serious pursuit of magic—as of shamanism, of Tantra—requires that your pointof view shift to that of the source of the knowledge. It requires that you abandon yoursafe place. Otherwise you are only standing at the edge of the Abyss and taking quickglances over the side. There is no information in that pose, no initiation possible in astate of suspended animation. You must enter a place where all the cool academictheories no longer obtain, where the comforting “it's all in your head” platitudes andattitudes have no meaning—because your head, your body, your soul and spirit are allfully engaged in ways they never have been before, and it is not what you expectedwhen you bought the ticket.The above is true about magic in general, but in the case of the Typhonian Tradition"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"it is especially important to understand these challenges. Because it is not a solartradition but a stellar one that reaches back into the very origins of the human race, theTyphonian magician is working without a net. As in the case with the Necronomicon,normal modes of protection may not obtain. The entities one meets in the Tunnels ofSet—as per Grant's trilogies—are not those that were bound by the Seal of Solomon;they are older than Solomon, older than dynastic Egypt, older than Babylon. The onlyreasonable description we have of the realm and its denizens is what we come across inLovecraft.The Typhonian Order focuses on the Lovecraftian entities, especially those of theCthulhu Mythos. The standard demons and evil spirits of the Judaeo-Christian traditionare unequal to the task of representing the deeper archetypes that are encountered inthis high-intensity approach to the magic.More than that, however, is the stated goal of the Order which is to make contactwith discarnate and extraterrestrial Intelligences. This is perfectly in accord with theLovecraftian tales which are concerned almost exclusively with this type of contact. Infact, by using terms like “discarnate” and “extraterrestrial” the Order is changing theparameters within which traditional ceremonial magic functions.Magic's nineteenth and twentieth century European and American manifestationswere still concerned with the medieval grimoires and their lists of demons and angels.It was a purely sectarian approach that was based on a Judaeo-Christian worldview.Groups like the Golden Dawn reinforced that approach but added Egyptian and othertraditions to the mix, thus expanding their reach somewhat.But the Typhonian Order grew up in the post-World War II era, in the age of atomicweapons, the Cold War, the space race, and UFO sightings. The idea of contact withentities other than human took on different meanings and implications. Magic was nolonger limited to a traditional religious environment, but in the mid-late twentiethcentury took on more contemporary dress. There has been more technologicaldevelopment in the seventy years since the end of World War II than there has been inthe previous thousand years, and this has affected the awareness of occultists in theWest. What had seemed magical a hundred years ago—communication over vastdistances in an instant, machines that can talk and answer questions, imagestransmitted through space without the use of wires, flying through space across theentire world, etc.—are now commonplace. The siddhis—the magic powers that are theresult, or the side effect, of Tantric and magical practice—were now within the reachof everyone on the planet. Magic, then, had to reach further and farther to identify thesource of its power and its utility, leading some to ask: Is magic useful?

Or undergo a few years of depthanalysis? Or go into a trance watching television or listening to your iPod?There was only one thing left and it was the hallmark of ceremonial magic.Communication with the Unseen. Traffic with extraterrestrial beings. Dinner dateswith the discarnate. As early as the 1950s, Kenneth Grant and his circle realized thatthe only thing separating magic from science was the ultimate ambition: contact withthe Otherworldly. Rather than sitting passively on a couch and recounting one'sdreams, Grant said let us become active participants in our dreams. Let us study andemploy dream control. Let us revert the normal processes of mind and body until wepass through the Gate into another mode of being entirely.Let us take back our souls before the scientists and the shrinks wash, rinse, and spin-dry our brains. Let us boldly go where no man, woman, computer nerd, or intelligenceofficer has gone before. The people running our massive, space-based telescopes areprobing the universe in ways never before thought possible; they are looking at thebeginning of the universe in the seconds after the Big Bang, and taking snapshots of itto show their kids.The only alternative left to the magician is to (a) posit the existence of a universeinvisible to human eyes (aided or unaided) and (b) go there.It may be true that one day science will be so advanced that it will beindistinguishable from magic, but that's not the point of orders like the Typhonianwhich put the human being back in the center of the cosmos. The world has become soenamored of its toys that it sits and waits patiently for the next new development, thenext smartphone, the next flat screen TV. The toys have become the center of theuniverse; the tools are replacing the mind, and as they do they replace the spirit.Technology is replacing pure science.But magic can be done on the cheap. All it takes is determination, discipline, andpractice. It is not for the couch potato or anyone looking for a quick fix. And that iswhy it is safe from the sweaty palms of the technocrats. For now.Grant's thesis is the same as Lovecraft's to a certain extent. They both concentrateon contact with extraterrestrial, supermundane creatures. Lovecraft fantasized about it;Grant tried to figure out how it could be done. But Lovecraft was a scientist and anatheist. The concept of sex with aliens frightened and disgusted him. Grant was amagician, and the possibilities of sex with aliens was like something out of Star Trek:weird, maybe, but not necessarily a bad thing. Orgiastic rites in the jungles to summonCthulhu? “I got that,” says Grant.But this is all much more important than that, more important than the author's glibreferences.

Read his books. He was French, but don'thold that against him. Foucault knew that a central focus of the State was control of thehuman body. Humans are viewed as expendable assets by the State (and, as we know,by the corporations as well). Human beings are to be controlled, manipulated,exploited, but never respected or elevated. Humans are force-fed bad food, badreligion, bad politics, bad economics. They are sent by the millions to fight and die ininexplicable conflicts. They are told what to eat, what to wear, how to behave.And for the most part, humans do behave. They are desensitized by media,threatened by governments, kept on subsistence diets, and generally lied to byeveryone.But Set, the Dark Lord, is not about behaving.Thelema was brought to the earth as a means of spiritual liberation, as anannouncement that big changes were taking place. It claims to empower the individual,to introduce that individual to his or her true potential to become kings and queens intheir own kingdoms.

It would take years of attention to the minutiae of the experiences to renderthem at all useful to others involved in the same project. That is where Grant'sfeverish, extreme form of Kabbalistic analysis came to play.The words, phrases, numbers, and associations jumble, struggle, leap, and slitherfrom Grant's mind like the rantings of a schizophrenic on the subway. One wonders attimes if the pages of the Typhonian Trilogies were written in crayon on the backs offlea market flyers. But Grant was sane. He was a lucid, functioning, and dedicatedindividual trying desperately to tell us something and realizing—as do all mystics—that normal human language is not equal to the task. So, sure, a lot of his gematria issuspect but then he knew that going in:There can be no association of ideas, no correspondences of any kind, betweennumbers or the ideas which they represent, except in the consciousness of theirsubject, because no thing exists as an objective reality, ... Numbers can mean tothe qabalist precisely what he wishes them to mean within the framework of hismagical universe. ... This is the basis of the science of numbers, and therationale of numerology as a creative art distinct from a merely interpretativegauge of phenomenal probabilities.203Grant calls this “creative gematria.” It's the point at which this author has thehardest time with his works, for it implies a breezy lack of concern with any kind ofconsistency, and is thus relatively useless for demonstrating connections andassociations to others. While his philosophical reasoning may be sound from the pointof view of advaita or non-dualist thinking in which every number is the same as anyother number, it is not useful for paying the bills. It may work well on a subjectivelevel as the magician makes his way through unfamiliar psychic territory and usesthese number games as a way of leaving breadcrumbs along the trail so he can find hisway back, but when it comes time to try to convince the rest of us that theseconnections exist, then we are back to the crayons and the schizophrenic in the subwaycar. Reading Grant is often an exercise in stripping away the gematria—the pages andpages of it—in order to get to the straight prose, for it is in the straight prose that hemakes his most astonishing claims, his most ambitious statements.

Grant's project is togo back to the pre-literate, pre-historic times because there is where the money isburied. He wants to take us back to the ancient civilizations that he opines once existedon the earth, like Atlantis and Lemuria. And he wants us, at the same time, to go to thestars.And that is Lovecraft's project, as well. Lovecraft wrote about nothing else save thisTradition. The Great Old Ones, the entombed High Priest Cthulhu, and all the othercreatures that populate his stories with horror and gore, are all atavisms of those times,and they share one thing in common: they came from the great Vastness of deep spaceand deep time.

But it takes time, patience,dedication and an uncommon intelligence to watch the stars at night, every night, foryears and years, and build star charts, maps, tables of declination and right ascension,and to measure the distances between these vastly-distant points of light in tinyincremental fractions of numbers. And then to realize that something important isgoing on up there, something “monumental,” and it has a direct effect on what goes onhere, on the earth, on the place They visited countless Aeons ago. And to which Theymight one day return.The Typhonians.The very word we use in the modern age for referring to otherworldly ideas, planes,levels is “astral,” which means “starry.” It is the Starry Wisdom cult of Lovecraft'sstory “The Haunter of the Dark.” We hear talk of the “astral plane” and the “astralbody” and rarely stop to consider what that means. It is the astral self that isindestructible, that is capable of doing the kind of time and space traveling that bothGrant and Lovecraft describe. And entire cults were built around its cultivation anduse.One of Grant's power-zones, the K'rla Cell, was designed with just that idea in mind.He describes it in Beyond the Mauve Zone, and tells of the intention of its members tocontact Azathoth and Yog-Sothoth, both Lovecraftian entities, and to use“psychosexual dynamics concealed in the Necronomicon.”204 This group eventually"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"identified the star Betelgeuse as the home of the Elder Gods, and a black holesomewhere in the constellation Sagittarius as the home of the Great Old Ones.It is this kind of magical practice that allows Grant to write seemingly outrageousstatements (for a serious occultist) as the following:Yog-Sothoth is the zenith of which Tutulu is the nadir, As solstitial points theyare balanced by their equinoctial counterparts East and West, represented in theNecronomicon cycle by Hastur and Shub Niggurath. The full complexformulates the Great Cross which typifies the crossing over from matter tospirit. This is represented on the Tree of Life by Daäth, and by Death in theVoodoo imagery of Baron Samedhi.205Well, you wanted us to take seriously stories about talking snakes, burning bushes,and Sodom and Gomorrah as the basis for a religious current that has lasted more thanfive thousand years; why not replace all of that with the Great Old Ones and ShubNiggurath, the “Goat with a Thousand Young”? Grant is saying we need a newnarrative, because the old one is not working. The old one is not up to the challengeswe will soon face as resources become limited, fanatics get the Bomb, andgovernments go all Emperor Nero on our ass. At least, with the Necronomicon Gnosis,we look the danger straight in the Eye. We grapple with the unpleasantness, the threats,the tension and stress of knowing that there is some spectacularly ugly catastrophelurking at the edges of our consciousness as the alien forces of which Grant writes soeloquently mass at the rent in the veil, waiting for the Gate to open ... or are alreadypouring in.The Book of Revelation, of Apocalypse, where we first encountered the ScarletWoman and the Beast was written at a time when it seemed civilization was coming toan end, much like the present age. Empires were at stake. Nations were beingswallowed whole. The Jewish revolt had failed, and that failure would haveconsequences for the next two thousand years. And in 33 CE, “God so loved the worldthat he gave his only-begotten Son.”Well, guess what? It's two thousand years later, and God has changed his mind."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The EndWho knows the end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise.Loathesomeness waits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over thetottering cities of men.—H. P. Lovecraft, “The Call of Cthulhu”The force is completely blind, depending upon the men and women in whom itmanifests and who guide it. Obviously, its guidance now tends towardscatastrophy.—Jack Parsons, The Book of Babalon, 1946Grant does not want us to worship Cthulhu or any of the Great Old Ones. That's notthe point. But we have to be aware of the forces that these names and ideas representbecause they are real forces, real ideas. Much of Grant's work involved identifyingthese forces, trying to understand them, to place them somewhere within a context withwhich we are already familiar—but not in reducing them to a simple equation ofCthulhu = Set. He knew there was much more to it than that. Yet, such shorthandcoding is useful in the beginning for it sets the parameters of the problem in a creativeway. When we start with Cthulhu = Set we will eventually wonder in which ways arethey the same, and in which ways are they different. What can Set tell us aboutCthulhu, and vice versa? Why is Set “real” and Cthulhu is not? And is that statementtrue?The Typhonian Tradition works at that very point where human imagination andcreativity have provided the world with its great religions and its great art. They areall, in a sense, works of imagination. They all come from the same place. The directexperience of the Divine can be horrifying and potentially deadly; the Bible is full ofsuch stories. So is Lovecraft. So is Grant.Magicians don't try to build ethical structures around their experiences and try totell other people how to live their lives. Well ... they shouldn't, anyway. Crowley'sdictum, quoted towards the beginning of this study, may very well be wrong. The aimof magic should not be religion, at least not as we understand it. Magic is an artform,and you don't create religions based on a painting or a pop song. You just create moremagic.Magic is the “science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will”according to Crowley. That doesn't sound much like religion. When magicians stopdoing magic, they create religions. The context of magical systems that arose out ofthe Judaeo-Christian tradition was linear: there was a beginning, the Creation, and anend, the Apocalypse. Everyone's eye was on the finish line. Thus there was a beginningand an end to magic, as well."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"But the Typhonian Tradition says that there was no beginning—just ancient days—and no end, because the universe is eternal and the yugas and the kalpas repeatthemselves endlessly. Time is not linear. What goes around ... well, you know.The magic of the Typhonian Tradition, therefore, is an ongoing project with no endin sight, which basically means no religion in the foreseable future. And that'sprobably a good thing. The Dark Lord represents chaos, not stability, not establishedinstitutions like churches and states. As humans, we crave stability but we need to getour heads around the chaos first. Because chaos is what's happening. We need to cometo terms with the Dark Lord.In the Necronomicon, the initiatory program is important. The rising on the sevenlevels of initiation is a requirement before one goes sailing off into deep space. Onemust be psychologically prepared for what will follow. These seven stages have theiranalogues in Chinese alchemy and in European alchemy. They are phases ofpurification and reification (and here purification is meant in a purely technical senseand not in a moral one). In India, one rises one chakra at a time, and it can take years toaccomplish the entire program.But once that is done, it's open season on trafficking with discarnate entities. TheNecronomicon Gnosis is perfectly consistent with both the Egyptian and the Thelemiccurrents, as Grant insists. The literature of each helps to explain the other; the practicesof each amplify and extend the other. The psycho-sexual techniques of Tantra can beemployed in rituals of the Necronomicon as well as within the Egyptian context,breathing new life into each. Just imagine for a moment equating Cthulhu withKundalini, which is precisely what Grant suggested. Or equating both with theEgyptian deity Set. That was Grant's intention and it is obvious from his work that he(and his followers) was dedicated to just that.The Dark Lord, like Kundalini and Cthulhu, lies dead but dreaming. In psycho-sexual terms, at the base of the spine waiting to be “evoked” through the “orgiasticrites” of the followers of Cthulhu. In magical terms, simultaneously deep within thebowels of the earth and at some unimaginable distance in deep space.Thank God for quantum theory and non-locality.We have seen that Crowley wrote a series of texts in 1907 that he called the HolyBooks, and that these were “received” texts, much like the Book of the Law itself.These writings are the most clearly Lovecraftian of all the pre-Grant Thelemicmaterial, with the possible exception of Jack Parsons and his Book of the Antichrist,written in 1948 and a year after the Roswell incident and the Kenneth Arnold UFOsighting ... and a year after the death of Crowley himself.I believe it is fair to say that Crowley did not understand completely the import ofthe Holy Books. (It has been demonstrated that it took Theodor Reuss to alert him tothe fact that one of his rituals, Liber XXXVI or the Star Sapphire ritual, was an encoded"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"form of the IXth degree ritual of the OTO.) The Holy Books in general are rather dark,and the language is pure Gothic horror. These are, the author contends, works thatmore properly belong to the Necronomicon Gnosis aspect of Thelema. Read in thatlight, their meanings become clearer.The same can be said of the work of Jack Parsons. He was intent on incarnating theRed Goddess, and equally intent on incarnating the Anti-Christ. He was focused onbringing about the End of Days so that the New Aeon could dawn. Yet, there issomething faintly disturbing about the Book of Antichrist that recalls some of theaccounts we have of alien abductions. In this brief text, he writes of being called byBabalon to continue the work he began with Hubbard in 1946, two years earlier. Hethen proceeds to describe a strange scene in which he approaches “cyclopean ruins”and a tower of Black Basalt. A robed figure shows him four of his previous lives, oneas Simon Magus, then as Gilles de Raiz, Earl Bothwell, and Cagliostro. Then, in a linethat almost prefigures what abductees would say, he writes:And thereafter I was taken within and saluted the Prince of that place, andthereafter things were done to me of which I may not write ...The brief account of his “Black Pilgrimmage” ends with him taking the Oath of theAbyss, filled with terror and foreboding, after being told, “It is not certain that you willsurvive ...” It is then that he assumes the identity of the Antichrist.He would die in an explosion less than four years later. He was 38 years old. Hismother committed suicide a few hours later upon learning of the death of her son.This is a Lovecraftian scenario, straight out of “The Dunwich Horror” or anynumber of his other stories: the magician who is also a scientist, summoning spirits,trafficking with discarnate entities, taking mysterious oaths in fear and trembling,proclaiming himself the Anti-Christ, and then dying in a spectacular ball of fire.And at some point we have to accept that this is what is happening: that the bizarrethemes we find in the purple prose of Gothic fiction have become the operatingprinciple of our world.Lovecraft wrote that the artists and the sensitives are the first to notice the incomingforces of the Great Old Ones. He could have added magicians to that list and, indeed,there were occultists among those who, in “The Call of Cthulhu,” responded to theCall. What he failed to realize—as an atheist—is that the occultists can push back.Those who “push back” in his stories are not occultists, but academics, scholars,intelligent third parties who find the unholy books, figure out the forbidden formulae,and then send the Old Ones back to where they came by closing and sealing the Gate.The Typhonian Tradition, however, is composed of the very type of people Lovecraft'sstories demonize: the magicians themselves. They have the unholy books, they knowthe forbidden formulae. And it is true, they do open the Gate."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"That cult would never die till the stars came right again, and the secret priestswould take the great Cthulhu from His tomb and revive His subjects and resumeHis rule of earth.

Forsomeone who wants to dig deeper into this system, this is a glaring hole in the data.There are some good reasons for this, and one of them is that this is a subject fraughtwith complexity and a bewildering number of Sanskrit terms and Vedic references, notall of which agree with each other. Another reason might be the advisability of usingVedic astrology in conjunction with the Ritual of the Fire Snake. And Vedic astrologyis not well-known in the West (aside from a few popular books on the subject) and it isvirtually ignored among the Thelemic magicians of the author's acquaintance(admittedly, very few!). To become reasonably expert in Vedic astrology wouldrequire a good knowledge of Sanskrit and tremendous patience with the ratherdisorganized and confusing array of books on the subject, and this is somewhat lackingamong occultists in the West.So what the author offers here is a list of the kalas with their associations and adiscussion of the kalas and the tithis: the phases of the Moon which are the same innumber as the kalas and which can afford us a better understanding of the wholesubject. In addition, the Nityas will also be listed: these are the deities associated withthe individual phases, or tithis. In this way, it is hoped that the new generation ofTyphonian magicians (and those simply interested in the subject) will have access to amore profound understanding of the praxis.As a side note, there will often be those who object to bringing in Asian conceptsand practices into a seemingly purely Western or European discipline. The objectionmay be from an academic, anti-universalist point of view or simply may be a matter oftaste. But the Typhonian Tradition, as the author understands it, is concerned with thepre-dynastic Egyptian traditions and those that are much older even than Sumer orMohenjo Daro. Ifwe recognize that control over the serpent brain is a key feature ofthis type of magic, then we also must recognize that this part of the human anatomydeveloped before the races had become differentiated from each other. What we shareis the basic psycho-biological structure of our anatomy. The practices that work inIndia will also work in Mexico, in Europe, and everywhere else once linguistic andcultural differences have been addressed. It's just that they have been codified better inIndia and China, which—as many academics now seem to agree—was the source forthe Western alchemical tradition, even though they were patently biological (and not"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"strictly or exclusively) mineral.The Typhonian Tradition, it should be obvious by now, rejects nothing and acceptswhatever works."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"The KalasQuite often, the kalas are identified with the tithis, or the phases of the Moon.However, the phases of the Moon have their own nomenclature (really little more thannumbers) while the kalas have more descriptive names.There are sixteen kalas, of which only fifteen are considered visible. Their namesare as follows:In the above list, the last kala—Amrita—is the invisible one. Readers will recall thatamrita is the word signifying the elixir vitae, the soma that descends from the cranialvault (or from a space a little above it) down through the body once union betweenKundalini and Shiva has been attained. For this reason, the kala named Amrita is ruledby a Nitya (in this case, a kind of Goddess of the kala) called the Maha TripuraSundari, i.e., the Goddess of the Sri Chakra. The other Nityas are as follows:"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"NityasThus, as we have said, the last Nitya—Maha Tripura Sundari, also known as theGoddess Sixteen—is not visible, and is associated with the kala Amrita."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"TithisAs mentioned, the names of the tithis are really just numbers in Sanskrit, but since onewill come across the names again and again in the Tantric and Jyotish literature, thefull list is given here:1. Pratipada2. Dwitiya (i.e., “second”)3. Tritiya (i.e., “third” etc.)4. Chaturthi5. Panchami6. Shashthi7. Saptami8. Ashtami (this is the Half Moon phase)9. Navami10. Dashami11. Ekadashi12. Dwadashi13. Trayodashi14. Chaturdashi15. Purnima (for the Full Moon) orAmavasya (for the New Moon).Now, to complicate things a little further, we must take the waning and waxingperiods of the Moon into consideration. There are thus a total of 30 kalas or tithis tomake a complete lunar cycle. In Indian astrology these are divided into the ShuklaPaksha (the waxing Moon) and the Krishna Paksha (the waning Moon). Thus, we canbe more specific in our enumeration of the tithis, as follows:1. Shukla Pratipada2. Shukla Dwitiya3. Shukla Tritiya4. Shukla Chaturthi5. Shukla Panchami6. Shukla Shashthi7. Shukla Saptami8. Shukla Ashtami9. Shukla Navami10. Shukla Dashami11. Shukla Ekadasi12. Shukla Dwadashi"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"13. Shukla Trayodashi14. Shukla Chaturdashi15.

Amavasya (New Moon)The first tithi—Shukla Pratipat—is 12 degrees of the Moon away from union withthe Sun. The second tithi—Shukla Dwitiya—is thus 24 degrees of separation from theSun, etc. This concept is quite important because the relationship between the Moonand the Sun is central to Indian astrology which computes everything from the Moonrather than the Sun. As we mentioned before, Indian astrology is not solar-based. Thepositions of the planets are computed from the Moon, and the houses of theastrological chart are similarly constructed. In addition, the actual positions of theplanets against the sidereal zodiac are employed, and the conventional dates of thezodiacal signs are not used. One's birthday, therefore, is calculated every year byreference to the original positions of both the Sun and the Moon on the day of birth.Thus, if one were born with the Sun in Libra and the Moon in the fifth tithi, one'sbirthday is not celebrated until both of those positions repeat themselves. So a birthdayin Indian astrology is both solar return and lunar return. The exact degrees will not berepeated each year, of course, but to some Vedic astrologers the emphasis will be onthe lunar phase (the tithi) being the same with the solar degree remaining the variable.When a Vedic astrologer computes an annual transit horoscope, for instance, it iscalculated from the tithi (the same one that occurred on the day of birth) rather thanfrom the solar return position. Both are taken into consideration, of course, because theangle between the Sun and the Moon—the two luminaries, but also representing thetwo essences that gave life to the individual, the kala and the bindu, the “blood” andthe semen, the red and the white—is of utmost importance. It has been a defect of"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Western astrology that the emphasis is on the solar aspects of the cosmos rather thanthe mingling of the essences of Shiva and Shakti, of the Moon and the Sun.Each of the phases of the moon—the tithis—have yantras (magic diagrams) andmantras associated with them. Each of the Nityas has her own yantra, mantra, andshakti as well. They also represent the sixteen vowels of the Sanskrit alphabet.According to several of the Tantras, the fifteen Nityas are to be visualized asoccupying spaces around the central, downward-pointing, triangle of the Sri Cakra.This inner triangle represents the yoni of the Goddess. In the very center of thistriangle is the bindu, the dot, that represents the Sixteenth Kala and therefore theGoddess Sixteen herself.Recourse to a book on Indian astrology would be helpful to the reader who wishes tounderstand this concept better, especially with regard to the kalas, the tithis and theirruling Nityas. Inclusion of the appropriate mantras and yantras as part of the Ritual ofthe Fire Snake as offered by Grant may be helpful as well, at least in the beginning, inorder to orient oneself with regard to the chakras, the kalas, the phases of the Moon,etc.While this information concerns the vaginal secretions, the male secretion is notignored entirely. It is believed by yogins, Ayurvedic physicians, and Indian alchemiststhat it takes fourteen days to replenish the semen after an ejaculation; this is roughlyequivalent to one paksha—i.e., either the waning or the waxing period of the Moon—so it may be safe to say that they are connected. Remember that as the Moon waxes,amrita is being poured into it (according to the Tantras); i.e., it is being stored in thelunar vessel. The day after the Full Moon, the amrita begins pouring back to the Sununtil the Moon is completely empty. It is the Tantrika who interrupts this process bydrawing the amrita down into his or her own body. A relevant image would be theTarot Trump known as Temperance in the old decks, which depicts a blonde Angel inrobes and wings pouring liquid from one cup to another. The Tarot trump known as theStar depicts a naked woman pouring the liquid onto the earth; above her head are sevenstars, surrounding a larger star in the central axis.Thus, a word to the Wise is sufficient."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY(E) indicates an Egyptian word(G) indicates a word from Greek(H) indicates a Hebrew word(Ha) indicates a word from Haitian Creole(J) indicates a Javanese word(L) indicates a Lovecraftian term(P) indicates a Pali term(S) indicates a word from Sanskrit(Su) indicates Sumerian(T) indicates a word peculiarly Thelemic(Ti) indicates a Tibetan wordAdvaita (S) Non-duality; a mystical state in which Subject and Object are one.Aeon (G) Gnosticism: an emanation from God, personified or identified as aparticular Being or Characteristic.
