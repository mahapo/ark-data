It is not subjected, as are thelatter, to Time and Circumstance or to the limitations from which theappearance of error, evil and deformity seem to spring.The Legend of Parzival is not subject to Time or Circumstance; itrepresents a glimpse of the Eternal Reality, the Everpresent Here and Now. Thecircumstances of its enactment and the place wherein the festival is beheld,need not be sought outside the Human Heart that has learned to beat in timeand tune with the Soul of the World. All who are born of “Heart’s Affliction”must eventually find their way to that spot where they “Scarcely move, yetswiftly seem to run” and having become one with “The Way, The Truth andThe Life” they will discover that the shifting scenes of the world they hadthought to be so real, will pass by them as a pageant until the Vision of theGrail Itself is presented to their pure Understanding.It is in the hope of awakening some spark of the smouldering fire of thisinner consciousness in the hearts of those who may read these lines - nothaving previously understood the Legend - and from that spark enkindling agreat fire that will burn up the veils which hide man from Himself - from God- that I have dared to add these fragments to the great mass of Grail Literaturealready given to the world.And to those who are slumbering contentedly, wrapped round with thedelusion and dreams of this illusory like, I cry with Gurnemanz:Hey! Ho! Wood-keepers twain! Sleep-keepers I deem ye! At least be movingwith the morning! Hear ye the call? Now thank the Lord That ye are called in timeto hear it.T"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4Point I.THE COMING OF PARZIVAL“By pity ‘lightened The guileless Fool - Wait for him, My chosen tool.”t is not my intention to set forth the complete Argument of the GreatMusical-Drama of “Parsifal” derived from the ancient legend of Parzival byRichard Wagner, to whom be all praise and honour.Those who have not had the privilege of witnessing this festival-play, oreven of reading a good translation of the Libretto, should avail themselves ofthe help that a study of the latter will give them before expecting to gain athorough grasp of the interpretation herein set forth.I shall also suppose that the student has some slight knowledge of TheMystic Path and of The Holy Qabalah, although I shall endeavor to make thepoints dealt with as comprehensive as possible to the uninitiated enquirer whois prepared to “wake and hearken to the Call”.The Music of Wagner I cannot give you, nor shall I even attempt aninterpretation of that which, in the Opera, helps so much toward the openingof those channels of consciousness whereby we may eventually receive somecomprehensive of the Music of the Spheres.Fortunately this is not entirely necessary, for the true Path leads to a pointwhen each individual may feel himself to be a highly-strung musicalinstrument whose Will runs over the strings causing complete and harmoniousvibrations in his own being, which will then seem to give forth anunformulated but delightful melody.What is the Keynote of Parzival?ECSTASY!And what is Ecstasy? It has been well described by one known to us asFrater Perdurabo, and I shall quote his own words: “There is a land of pure delight, Where saints immortal reign.” “So used some of us to sing in childhood, and we used to think of that land as far away, farther even than death that in those days seemed so far. “But I know this now: that land is not so far as my flesh is from my bones! it is Here and Now. I"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5“If there is one cloud in this tranquil azure, it is this thought: that conscious beings exist who are not thus infinitely happy, masters of ecstasy. “What is the path to this immortal land? To the Oriental, medita-tion offers the best path. To the Western, there is no road better than ceremonial. For ecstasy is caused by the sudden combination of two ideas, just as oxygen and hydrogen unite explosively. “But this religious ecstasy takes place in the highest centres of the human organism; it is the soul itself that is united to its God; and for this reason the rapture is more overpowering, the joy more lasting, and the resultant energy more pure and splendid than in aught earthly. “In ritual therefore, we seek continually to unite the mind to some pure idea by an act of will. This we do again and again, more and more passionately, with more and more determination, until at last the mind accepts the domination of the will, and rushes of its own accord toward the desired object. This surrender of the mind to its Lord gives the holy ecstasy we seek.” Here we have one of the most important keys to the interpretation of theDrama of Parzival, and also an indication of the result which Wagner desired toproduce upon the minds of his audience.Unless the Play is properly staged, and the parts taken by those whothemselves understand at least something of the “Way of Holiness”, this effectis not made upon the consciousness of the onlookers. This is doubtless one thereasons why Wagner made arrangements that this Work should only beproduced at Bayreuth in a proper setting and under right conditions, for itrepresents the summit of his Magical Mountain of which the base was theRing. He called it a Stage-Consecrating Festival, and its effects were intended toexert their influence upon the Drama of Life itself.We will pass over the early part of the opening Scene with its introductionof Gurnemanz, Kundry, and Amfortas, and concentrate our attention on theentry of Parzival; heralded by the falling of a Swan brought down by his ownweapon.What is this Swan?ECSTASY!How do I know? Never mind, let me quote once again from one who isthe Master thereof:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6THE SWAN “There is a Swan whose name is Ecstasy; it wingeth from the deserts of the North; it wingeth through the blue; it wingeth over the fields of rice; at its coming they push forth the green. In all the Universe this Swan alone in motionless; it seems to move, as the Sun seems to move; such is the weakness of our sight. O fool! criest thou? Amen. Motion is relative: there is Nothing that is still. Against this Swan I shot an arrow; the white breast poured forth blood. Men smote me; then perceiving that I was a Pure Fool, they let me pass. Thus and not otherwise I came to the Temple of the Grail.”Thus did Parzival bring down Ecstasy to Earth, although the King -Amfortas - and his Knights had “esteemed it a happy token, when o’er the lakeit circled aloft”.What is this lake? When calm and unruffled, brooded over by the Swan ofEcstasy, it is the human mind trained by the proper methods to RightContemplation. For only when the mind is still may the Sun of the true Self beseen reflected in its depths. From that it is but one step to the attainment ofRight Ecstasy when the Sun plunges into the depths of the Mind and thewhole being is aflame with the Sacred Fire of the Holy Spirit.Parzival had aimed high; he had hit the mark of his Aspiration, littlethough his action was at first understood. Yet his Folly saved him, as he in turnsaved others.When questioned as to his action he answered “I knew not ‘twas wrong”although he flung away weapon, having no further use for it in that form.What was his weapon? The Bow of Promise and the Arrow of PureAspiration. But he had aspired, he had hit the mark and the promise had beento a certain extent fulfilled.The Qabalist will at once recognise the “Path of Samech or Sagittarius theArcher on the ‘Tree of Life.’” This is the Path of the Arrow that cleaves theRainbow, leading directly from Yesod - The Foundation - to Tiphareth theSphere of the Sun, Beauty and Harmony, or the Human Heart wherein theMysteries of the Rosy Cross and of the Holy Grail are first - if dimly -perceived.To what other use had Parzival - son of Heart’s Affliction - previously puthis weapon? He had shot at all that flies. He had shot at the Eagle, the bird thatfears not to gaze upon the very Sun itself.What does this eagle mean and what does it foreshadow?ECSTASY!"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7For it is written: “The Eagle is that Might of Love which is the Key ofMagick, uplifting the Body and its appurtenance unto High Ecstasy upon hisWings.”This Eagle is known to Occultists as one of the Four Cherubic Beasts andhe represents one of the Four Powers of the Sphinx. Likewise he is attributed byEliphas Levi to Azoth, the formula of the Alpha and Omega, the First and Last.It was by the right use of this Might of Love that Parzival succeeded whereothers had failed. For again it is written in Liber Aleph: “Consider Love. Here is a force destructive and corrupting whereby have many men been lost: witness all History. Yet without love man were not man. “We see Amfortas, who yielded himself to a seduction, wounded beyond healing; Klingsor, who withdrew himself from a like danger, cast out forever from the Mountain of Salvation, and Parzival who yielded not, able to exercise the true Power of Love and thereby to perform the Miracle of Redemption.” But though we are now nearing that realm wherein “Time and Space areOne” we must not allow ourselves to be rushed forward too rapidly.There were many things that Parzival did not know, or which he professednot to know when questioned. He did now as yet know he True Name - theWord of His Being - though he had in the past been called by many names.Some things he knew and remembered clearly; there was one thing he desiredto know and to understand.What is the Grail!To which Gurnemanz very properly replies: I may not say: But if to serve it thou be bidden, Knowledge of it will not behidden.- And lo!- Methinks I know thee now indeed; No earthly road to it dothlead, By no one can it be detected Who by itself is not elected.To which Parzival, without further questioning, replies: I scarcely move, Yet I swiftly seem to run.And Gurnemanz: My son, thou seest Here SPACE and TIME are ONE.Now, in truth, have we come to the beginning of the True Path which inthe clear Light is one with the end thereof.What says Blavatsky in “The Voice of the Silence”? “Bestride the Bird ofLife if thou wouldst know!”And this Bird - this Swan - so seeming dead until its Powers be known?Some have compared it to the Sacred Word, the Great Word AUM. For it is"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8written: “AUM is the hieroglyph of the Eternal. A the beginning sound, U itsmiddle and M its end, together forming a single Word or Trinity, indicatingthat the Real must be regarded as of this three-fold nature. Birth, Life andDeath, not successive, but one.”The Illusory nature of Time and Space, which are but modes of our finitemind, has been made very clear by Sidney Klein in his excellent book “Scienceand the Infinite,” but this is no new idea. The attainment of Ecstasy has provedto Initiates of every land that there is a state of consciousness wherein bothtime and space are blotted out - at least temporarily - and at the same momentthe limitations of the “personal ego” no longer oppress us. In that Holy Bookknown as Liber LXV, Chapter II, Verses 17-25, we read: “17. Also the Holy One came upon me, and I beheld a white swan floating in the blue. 18. Between its wings I sate, and the aeons fled away. 19. Then the swan flew and dived and soared, yet no whither we went. 20. A little crazy boy that rode with me spake unto the swan and said: 21. Who art thou that doth float and fly and dive and soar in the inane? Behold, these many aeons have passed; whence camest thou? Whither wilt thou go? 22. And laughing I chid him saying: No whence! No wither! 23. The swan being silent, he answered: Then if with no goal, why this eternal journey? 24. And I laid my head against the Head of the Swan, and laughed, saying: Is there not joy ineffable in this aimless winging? Is there not weariness and impatience for who would attain to some goal? 25. And the swan was ever silent. Ah, but we floated in the infinite Abyss. Joy! Joy! White swan bear thou ever me up between thy wings.”But there was much that Parzival must do before taking his ease thus: hehad a mission to accomplish, on earth, though as yet he knew not.By the use of these examples, we may begin to comprehend what happensnext. A new “movement without motion” on the part of Parzival andGurnemanz is now symbolized by the SCENERY in the Drama shifting, at firstalmost imperceptibly, from Left to Right. The forest - in which the First Scenehad taken place - disappears; a door opens in the rocky cliffs and conceals thetwo; they are then seen again in sloping passages which they appear to ascend.At last they arrive at a mighty hall, which loses itself overhead in a high vaulted"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9dome, down from which the light streams in. From the heights above the domecomes the increasing sound of chimes.Again we may find a very direct correspondence in the Eastern Teachingsas propounded by Madame Blavatsky in “The Voice of Silence.” She writes:“Thou canst travel on that Path until thou hast become the Path itself.”Further in Liber CCCXXXIII by Frater Perdurabo we read: “O thou that settest out upon the Path, false is the Phantom that thou seekest. When thou hast it thou shalt know all bitterness, thy teeth fixed in the Sodom-Apple. Thus hast thou been lured along That Path, whose terror else had driven thee far away. O thou that stridest upon the middle of The Path, no phantoms mock thee. For the stride’s sake thou stridest. Thus art thou lured along That Path whose fascination else had driven thee far away. “O thou that drawest toward the End of The Path, eVort is no more. Faster and faster dost thou fall; thy weariness is changed into IneV-able Rest. For there is no Thou upon that Path: thou hast become The Way.”And each must learn to travel this Path, each must overcome his ownobstacles, unmask his own illusions. Yet there is always the possibility thatothers may help us do this and, as in the case of Parzival led by Gurnemanzwho travelled that Way before, we may be guided in the true Path and taughtto avoid the many false byways that may tempt us in our search for the Templeof the Holy Grail. In fact, if our training has been right and our aspirationremains pure, we must inevitably arrive at the end of that Road; often we mayseem to do so in the twinkling of an eye, and when we least expect it.We should remember that every point of this Drama is highly symbolic.The student may place his own interpretation on that passage which opens intothe Temple of the Grail. On arrival therein we cannot do better than listen tothe advice of Gurnemanz to Parzival, who meanwhile stands spellbound withWonder at what he beholds: Now give good head, and let me see, If thou’rt a Fool and pure, Whatwisdom thou presently canst secure. And this WISDOM Parzival does in due course secure, but not until hehas undergone many trials. For WISDOM is the HOLY SPEAR itself, longlost to the Knights of the Grail but eventually recovered by The Pure Fool.Meanwhile, during the Feast of the Grail, Parzival stands still andspellbound like a rude clod. He sees the CUP of the Grail uncovered, hewitnesses the ceremony of the Companions of the Grail, and he attains a"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10certain interior UNDERSTANDING which transcends knowledge. For theCUP is the UNDERSTANDING, though in this instance it was divorcedfrom the WILL or WISDOM, the Holy Spear which alone is capable ofenlightening it perfectly.A word may now be said regarding the nature of “The Pure Fool”; andsince this Ritual is one for all time, we shall go back before the Christian Era(to which the Grail Mystery is usually particularly attributed) back to AncientChina where the testimony of that Holy Sage Lao Tze gives us no uncertainclue. The Way of the Tao - Wu Wei - the accomplishment of all things bydoing Nothing, is precisely similar to the “Path” we have been describing. LaoTze says: “The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased as if enjoying a full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of their presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look dejected and for-lorn, as I had no home to go to. The multitude of men all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost everything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of chaos. Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull and confused. I seem to be carried about as on a sea, drifting as if I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while I alone seem dull and incapa-ble, like a rude borderer. Thus I ALONE AM DIFFERENT from other men, but I value the Nursing-Mother (The Great Tao).”So we see this Fool is not the ordinary sort of foolish and besotted personto which the form is usually applied. In his Foolishness we find his differencefrom his fellows; for in sooth it is the Divine Madness of Ecstasy whichredeems from all pain. It is “That which remains” after the sorrows andshadows that pass and are done, have left our being. Then Existence isrecognized to be Pure Joy. But Understanding without Wisdom is PureDarkness, and in this state is Parzival discovered by Gurnemanz at the end ofthe Ceremony. This is a darkness even Guernemanz is unable to comprehend,for he says:Why standest thou there? Wist thou what thou sawest?And Parzival, shaking his head slightly, he continues:Thou art then nothing but a Fool!And pushing Parzival through a small door he cries angrily:"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11Come away, on thy road the gone And put my rede to use: Leave all our swansfor the future alone And seek thyself a gander, a goose.And so it came about that Parzival set out alone upon his Holy Quest."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12Point IITHE TEMPTING OF PARZIVAL“For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.” -Liber Al vel Legishe last Scene of the First Act of this Drama will have enabled us to seesomething of the nature of the “Heart” or Temple of the Knights of theGrail. We are next transported to the “Keep” of Klingsor’s Castle, thereto obtain a glimpse of the Heart of a Black Magician. Klingsor represents onewho has “shut himself up”, who desires to keep his personality and whileretaining possession of the SPEAR or Divine Will to make use of it, if possiblefor his own personal ends.Man is given a certain freedom of will in order that he may therebydevelop the sense of Freedom and so willingly ally himself with the Divine Willor True Purpose of his Being. Should he make the mistake of attempting toreverse the process, turning the Divine Will to merely personal ends, he mustinevitably fall. He thereby cuts himself off from the Universal Current and isslowly but surely disintegrated until he is finally lost in the Abyss.For a time, however, as in the case of Klingsor, he may seem to exercise anillusionary power by taking advantage of the delusions of others. For he playsupon their emotional natures, which tend if uncontrolled to befog the mindthus preventing the True Sun of Being from illuminating their Path.Self-damned, the one desire of such a being is to cause the utter ruin anddownfall of others in order that the terrible loneliness which he - if dimly -realizes to be his fate, may be assuaged by the presence of his victims.Klingsor, however, still hopes to capture the Holy CUP itself - which hasremained in the possession of the Knights of the Grail - for this is the Cup ofUNDERSTANDING whereby he may discover a way to reverse this fate andto make use of its contents, the Divine Substance which is capable of infinitetransformation when united with the Spear or WILL.Even without this perfect means of transmutation, he has still obtained acertain power over Astral Matter, which being of a very plastic nature is capableof transformation into images alluring or terrible according to the effect to beproduced upon his victims.The Aspirant has been warned of the illusory nature of the Astral Plane in“The Voice of Silence” which contains instructions for those ignorant of thedangers of the lower Siddhi (magical powers). We shall refer to theseinstructions again in the proper place.T"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13Meanwhile, as the Act opens, we discover Klingsor seated before his magicmirror in the Keep of his Castle. He is surrounded with the instruments of hisart, which are as complex as the true weapons are simple.He is evidently aware of the coming of Parzival - the Guileless Fool - andhe realizes that here is a menace to his power, since that power depends uponbeguilement. The question before him is whether this Fool is really too Pure tobe tempted by the subtle blandishments of his magic art.Kundry - Woman - capable alike of raising man to the heights or dragginghim to the very depths, is the best instrument to his hand. She - the AnimalSoul of the World - while directed by the lower will or intellect - has within hernot alone the possibilities of redemption, but of taking her rightful place uponthe Throne of the Mother if brought to Understanding the Higher Will andWisdom of the Father of All.On the other hand if under the influence of the lower will she is allowedto seduce man from his aspiration, do that he fails to discover his True Will(which is one with Destiny and the Will of God and which alone can directhim in his proper course) she ruins him and at the same time loses her ownchance of redemption. He is then doomed to wander in paths of illusionhaving no comprehension of the true Purpose of his Being or hers.Klingsor exercises a mighty power over Kundry whenever she allowsherself to fall asleep, though much of her time during waking hours is devotedto the service of the Knights of the Grail. Many of these she has injured whileunder the spell of Klingsor. She often desires to make amends but her heart istorn between this form of activity and desire for case.Whenever she sinks back into the sloth of Ignorance, or what the Hindusterm the Tamas Guna, she is subject to the art of Klingsor for he is the makerof Illusion through Learning or the Powers of the mind, the principle known asRajas. By means of this mental power many false uses may be devised for theLove nature, which when wrongly used becomes destructive instead of Creativeand constructive.Parzival - The Pure Fool - is in that condition mentioned by Lao Tze “Hisdesires having as yet given no indication of their presence.” The crucial test iswhether when they are aroused for the first time he will use them rightly orwrongly. Therein both Amfortas and Klingsor had failed, though in differentways. Now comes a third candidate in the form of Parzival and Klingsor fearsgreatly for the continuance of his own power.He knows that even Kundry will be redeemed should Parzival, by rejectingher advances, and refusing to accept aught but the highest, cause her at last toUnderstand and so become released from Klingsor’s illusory powers."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14Klingsor first lights incense, which in true magick is a symbol of theaspiration of the lower towards the higher. But there is no Lamp above thealtar, and the Lamp symbolizes the Higher Aspiration to draw up and unite thelower with itself. The incense alone produces nothing but the smoky cloudswhich represent the Astral Plane, and this plane being particularly attributed tothe Desires and Emotions is the one most suited to the work Klingsor wishesKundry to perform. It is her Astral body over which he has the most influence.His call to her is worthy of notice: Arise! Draw near me! The Master calls thee, nameless woman: She-Lucifer!Rose of Hades! Herodias wert thou. And what else? Gundryggia there, Kundry here!Approach! Approach then, Kundry! Unto thy Master appear!And in the incense smoke now appears the figure of Kundry - her Astralform - half-obedient, half rebellious to the will of Klingsor.The term “Rose of Hades” should be noticed here, for in a certain senseKundry is that same Rose which is to be found in connection with the Cross inthe Rosy Cross Ceremonies. The Cross of Suffering may be looked upon asrepresented by Amfortas - as can be shown Qabalistically - and the wound athis breast is caused by the Rose, Kundry. The Spear and Cup convey the sameSymbolism but on a Higher Plane.Meanwhile Kundry gradually comes under the spell of Klingsor, whoorders her to use all her wiles to ensnare the approaching and victoriousParzival; “Whom sheerest Folly shields.”Klingsor, while admitting that he cannot hold Kundry, claims that he canforce her to his will: “Because against me Thine own power cannot move” Kundry, laughing harshly, makes this strange reply: Ha Ha! Art thou chaste!This remark causes Klingsor to sink into gloomy brooding. He recalls howhe, too, had once sought the holier life and the service of the Grail. But, unlikeAmfortas who had succumbed to seduction, he, thinking to avoid a like fatehad used his will to attempt something against Nature and God; the totalsuppression of his Love nature. This had resulted in an enforced chastity, givinghim power to avoid seduction - ‘tis true - but likewise cutting him off from thepossibility of redemption. For hear his words: Awfulest strait! Irrepressible yearning woe! Terrible lust in me once rife, WhichI had quenched with devilish strife; Mocks and laughs it at me, Thou devil’s bride,through thee? Have a care!In spite of further threats, we find Kundry still affirming that she will notconform to Klingsor’s demands, yet, such is woman-kind, she quietly"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15disappears to make ready for the reception and tempting of Parzival; who is atleast a live and vigorous human being.Klingsor has been watching Parzival’s approach to his magic castle, armed- ‘tis said - with the Sword of Innocence and protected by the Shield of Folly.Rather I should interpret this Sword as that of Reason, for Parzival has learnedin his Folly to disarm and defeat the defenders of Klingsor’s Castle with theirown weapons.There is no deeper wound than that inflicted by our own weapons turnedagainst us; as Amfortas had found to his lasting pain and anguish.The opportunities we have missed but had the power to take and mighthave taken, rankle more deeply than all the vain regrets for those things whichwere impossible of attainment.But the mere possession of the most sacred weapon - as in the case ofKlingsor and the Holy Spear - without further possibility of its right use, isbitterest of all.And so we find, when Kundry has ‘gone to work’, Klingsor’s Tower slowlysinks and disappears from sight. At the same time his “Garden of Desire” risesand his beautiful but illusory creations “The Flower Maidens” appear beforeour astonished eyes.Parzival, whose desires have as yet given no indication of their presence,has by this time arrived at the wall of the garden. What he beholds is butsubsidiary to his main Purpose to retrieve the Holy Spear, yet he, too, standsamazed.This may be deemed as Parzival’s introduction to “The Hall of Learning”as it is called by Madame Blavatsky in “The Voice of the Silence.” Let us turnaside for a moment in order to obtain a clearer idea of just what that termimplies. We read in Chapter I, Verses 22-291as follows: 22. Three Halls, O weary Pilgrim, lead to the end of toils. Three halls, O conqueror of Mara, will bring thee through three states into the fourth, and thence into the Seven Worlds, the Worlds of Rest Eternal. 23. If thou would’st learn their names, then hearken, and remember. The name of the first hall is IGNORANCE - Avidya. It is the Hall in which thou saw’st the light, in which thou livest and shalt die. [Ignorance corresponds to Malkuth and Nepesh (the animal soul), Learning to Tiphareth and Ruach (the Mind), and Wis-1. From the version published in The Equinox. Bracketed comments are by Aleister Crowley."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16dom to Binah and Neshamah (the aspiration or Divine Mind). - Fra. O.M.] 24. The name of Hall the second is the Hall of LEARNING. In it thy soul will find the blossoms of life, but under every flower is a ser-pent coiled. 25. The name of the third Hall is WISDOM, beyond which stretch the shoreless waters of AKSHARA, the indestructible Fount of Omniscience. [Akshara is the same as the Great Sea of the Qabalah. It is also the CUP of the GRAIL, as WISDOM is the SPEAR.] 26. If thou wouldst cross the first Hall safely, let not thy mind mis-take the fires of lust that burn therein for the sunlight of life. 27. If thou would’st cross the second safely, stop not the fragrance of its stupefying blossoms inhale. * * * 28. The WISE ONES tarry not in the pleasure grounds of the senses. 29. The WISE ONES heed not the sweet-tongued voices of illusion. Enough has been quoted to show the extraordinary correspondencesbetween the “Garden Scene” of the Drama of Parzival with both the EasternTeachings and those of the Holy Qabalah. But this Drama is not subject toTime or Circumstance.We left Parzival in a state of wonder upon the wall of Klingsor’s Garden.We n e x t find the “Flower Maidens” bemoaning the loss of their lovers - theirpleasures - slain by Parzival upon his approach to the Castle and entry to theGarden.The Flower Maidens are easily solaced, however, by the hope that here is afresh pleasure, stronger and more potent than those lost to them. One that willmore than take the place of all the others.In this hope they are deceived for - as in real life - pleasures in time losetheir hold (especially if abused) and though we may seek a stronger and moreintense form of amusement, our power to enjoy may become dulled and lost tous.The case in point is somewhat different, however, for the Flower Maidensfind that the power to enjoy does not lie with them, for Parzival - with his OnePurpose - is not to be turned aside for the sake of lesser pleasures.Why should he, when by waiting he may gain All instead of a mere partialrapture? Has he not already experienced the Higher form of Ecstasy? Thequestion now arises whether he had realised that this Higher Ecstasy with itsPurity and STILLNESS is more to be esteemed than the APPARENTACTIVITY of the lesser order."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17In the Higher forms of Ecstasy characterized by this quality ofSTILLNESS, the ACTIVITY is in reality SO INTENSE that it appears toCEASE. But the resultant Rapture is in that case more refined andconsequently more Powerful than in the Peace which passeth allunderstanding. Kundry may be said to have so far sought Rest below theVibration of the RED RAY, while Parzival has found it beyond that of theULTRA-VIOLET.And so, when later, Kundry uses all her charms to tempt Parzival, she fails.Her embrace awakens the vibration of the RED RAY in the heart of Parzivaland in this he recognizes, sympathetically, the cause of the wound of Amfortasand wherein the latter had failed. For Amfortas had been content to acceptLESS than was his DUE, a vibration lower than the one to which his being wascapable of responding.Once the string of the Instrument or of the Bow has been slackened, itspower is reduced; once the WILL has become the `will’ it needs re-tuning tothe Divine or Higher Vibration, but it cannot thus re-tune itself once self-willhas usurped the place of SELF-WILL.In that case the Holy Spear of Will and Wisdom has been replaced by theSword of Reason. This Sword is both useful and necessary until man hasobtained possession of the Holy Spear or become conscious of his true Purpose,(Just as Reason is necessary until we attain to Wisdom and Understandingwhereby the Truth is directly perceived without the necessity of inference anddeduction) but once the higher faculties have been acquired and the HigherWill recognized as the true guiding Power of our lives, our Purpose must bekept pure and unsullied.This Mystery is made clear in Liber Al vel Legis: “Let it be that state of manyhood bound and loathing. So with thy all; though hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect. The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none!”So we come to understand how the Perfect Cup and the Perfect Spear -Pure Understanding and Wisdom - are one; nay, are none since all ‘knowledge’is cancelled out in Perfect Ecstasy.Parzival yields not to the glamour of time and circumstance for he seeksthe Eternal Reality, the everpresent Here and Now. The chance of a briefreflection of ecstasy on the physical plane does not deter him from his Questfor that which is CONTINUOUS as the Body of Our Lady Nuit or the Stars"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18of Heaven. But, meanwhile, since he has left behind him - in the Temple of theGrail - the true Chalice of Ecstasy, his first duty is to seek the Holy Spear, themeans whereby alone it may be vivified and enlightened.Under the influence of Kundry he obtains a glimpse of his true purpose,the mission of Redeemer. Having realized the cause of the wound of Amfortashe determines to seek and obtain the means whereby it may be cured. Nor is heto be turned aside from this deed of compassion for in vain does Kundryquestion: And was it my kiss This great knowledge conveyed thee? If in my arms I mighttake thee, ‘Twould then a god surely make thee. Redeem the world then, if ‘tis thyaim: Stand as a god revealed; For this hour let me perish in flame, Leave aye thewound unhealed. But Parzival is determined that he will first heal the wound of Amfortas -King of the Grail - and he offers Kundry redemption at the price of hershowing him the way back to the Castle of the Grail.This would perhaps have seemed the reasonable course for Kundry topursue. But the Task of Parzival, by the proper performance of which he maybecome MASTER OF THE TEMPLE, is not thus easy of accomplishment.He must, in fact, on his return to the Temple bring with him theNEOPHYTE in his hand. He must have proved his power to raise the FallenDaughter - or Animal Soul - to the Throne of the Mother -Understanding. It ishis task to lead Kundry to the Mountain of Salvation, not hers to show him theway.Besides, he has not yet obtained the means of curing the wound ofAmfortas. Mere compassion for his anguish, mere realization of the cause ofthe trouble is not enough. Had he returned at this juncture his mission wouldhave been a failure.But Kundry - womanlike - does not pursue the reasonable course, and inthe end her intuition produces the finer flowering. Yet she is not conscious ofthis for the intuition is clouded in her mind by her emotional nature. She isaware that she has been flouted, that her charms have failed to seduce Parzivalfrom the sacred mysteries, as she has seduced Amfortas. For Parzival has toldher: Eternally Should I be damned with thee, If for one hour I forget my holymission, Within thine arm’s embracing! And this is no pleasant pill for any pretty woman to swallow.Nor could her appeal to his pity (though in truth washed “By Pity‘lightened”) turn him aside from his larger purpose; even when this appeal was"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19coupled with the promise that he should straightway see the Path to the Grail ifhe lingered but an hour.Desperate, Kundry cries: “Begone, detestable wretch.”and calling upon Klingsor (the only Master Will she knows) to avenge herwrong, she at the same time curses Parzival and all the Paths wherein he mighttravel, should they lead away from her.And here the intuition that she is really necessary to his Attainmentactually brings about the next step towards that end, by strange means. Parzivalneeds above all to realize the Nature of his True Will. And Klingsor has at thismoment appeared upon the Castle wall; the Damsels rushing out of the Castlehasten towards Kundry, while Klingsor - poising a lance - cries: Halt there! I’ll ban thee with befitting gear: The Fool shall perish by hisMaster’s spear!All else having failed, Klingsor make use of the Sacred Spear Itself. Hehurls his WILL at Parzival, who, being perfectly receptive to the Higher Power(no matter what the agency used to bring it to him) receives the Spear, not inhis heart, but in his hand. For - as in the case of the Higher WILL at the timeof the opening of the 1001 petalled Lotus, the Real Flower of the Garden - it isseen gently floating above his head, within his reach and power to grasp.And so Parzival grasps his True Purpose and brandishing the Holy Spearwith a gesture of exalted rapture, he makes the Sign of the Cross therewith.Now the Sign of the Cross is symbolical of that “Cross of the Elements” fromwhich the Creative Word issued at the birth of the dawning Universe.A New Word is, as it were, uttered by Parzival and once again the HolySpirit may be said to brood upon the Waters of Chaos. For at this moment, aswith an earthquake, the Castle falls to ruins; the false Garden withers, and thedamsels lie like shrivelled flowers strewn around on the ground. Kundry sinksdown with a cry, and to her turns once more - from the summit of the ruinedwall - the departing Parzival:Thou knowst - Where only we shall meet again.And, having uttered these prophetic words, he disappears among theshadows."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20Point IIITHE REDEMPTION OF THE REDEEMER“Höchsten Heiles Wunder! Erlösung dem Erlöser!”efore passing on to the final scenes of this Drama, it is necessary that weshould know something of the Great Ceremony of Initiation into theGrade of Master of the Temple which Parzival was undergoing. Thisknowledge may best be obtained from the Records of the Great Brotherhooditself, and from the actual examples of those Who have undergone the Ordealsleading thereto.The serious Student will be greatly interested in observing how closelysome of the passages we have already quoted, and those we are about to quote,parallel the events in the Drama as compiled by Richard Wagner. But it mustbe remembered that Wagner himself received Instructions in the greatPrinciples of the Holy Order from certain of the Secret Chiefs and thisaccounts for the great harmony between his Work and that of other membersof the Great Brotherhood.We find in Liber IV these words: “The Master of the Temple has crossed the Abyss, has entered the Pal-ace of the King’s Daughter; he has only to utter one word, and all is dissolved. But, instead of that, he is found hidden in the earth, tend-ing a garden. This mystery is all too complex to be elucidated in these fragments of impure thought; it is a suitable subject for meditation.”Parzival enters the Abyss when, casting aside every personal considerationand actuated by Pure Will delivered from the lust of result, he destroysKlingsor’s Garden and Keep.All that structure, built upon Reason, is shattered, and nothing but arubbish-heap remains. For Parzival had discovered the Power of the Wordwhereby the Universe vanishes in Fire and Flame. This may therefore be lookedupon as the supreme Banishing Ritual.But the process of Creation, Preservation and Destruction is continuous;things must be destroyed on order that they may be renewed. It is from therubbish-heap of Chronozon (Klingsor) that one selects the materials for a god,or for a New Aeon. Understanding is the structuralization of knowledge, andimplies coordination.But, in the meanwhile Parzival must tend a Garden of his own, for, havinglooked upon the “Face of the Father” he has become NEMO - No-man. (It isB"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21interesting to note that Klingsor termed Kundry “Nameless woman”, for she,too, must attain to Understanding in the end.)A study of Liber CCCXVIII, 13th Aethyr, will give us a fullercomprehension of this Mystery. Therein we read: “No man hath beheld the face of my Father. Therefore he that hath beheld it is called NEMO. And know thou that every man that is called NEMO hath a garden that he tendeth. And every garden that is and flourisheth hath been prepared from the desert by NEMO, watered with the waters that were called death. And I say unto him: To what end is the garden prepared? And he saith: First for the beauty and delight thereof; and next because it is written ‘And Tetra-grammaton Elohim planted a garden eastward in Eden.’ And lastly, because though every flower bringeth forth a maiden, yet there is one flower that shall bring forth a man-child. And his name shall be called NEMO, when he beholdeth the face of my Father. And he that tendeth the garden seeketh not to single out the flower that shall be NEMO. He doeth naught but tend the garden. And I said: Pleas-ant indeed is the garden, and light is the toil of tending it, and great is the reward. And he said: Bethink thee that NEMO hath beheld the face of my Father. In his is only Peace. And I said: Are all gardens like unto this garden? And he waved his hand, and in the Aire across the valley appeared an island of coral, rosy, with green palms and fruit trees, in the midst of the bluest of the seas. “And he waved his hand again, and there appeared a valley shut in by mighty snow mountains, and in it were pleasant streams of water, rushing through, and broad rivers, and lakes covered with lilies. And he waved his hand again, and there was a vision, as it were an oasis in the desert. And again he waved his hand, and there was a dim country with grey rocks, and heather, and gorse, and bracken. * * * And he seems to read my thought, which is, that I should love to stay in this garden forever: for he sayeth to me: Come with me, and behold how NEMO tendeth his garden. So we enter the earth, and there is a veiled figure, in absolute darkness. Yet it is perfectly possible to see in it, so that the minutest details do not escape us. And upon the root of one flower he pours acid so that root writhes as if in a tor-ture. And another he cuts, and the shriek is like the shriek of a man-drake, torn up by the roots. And another he chars with fire, and yet another he anoints with oil. And I said: Heavy is the labour, but great is the reward. And the young man answered me: He shall not see the reward; he tendeth the garden. And I said: What shall come"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22unto him? And he said: This thou canst not know, nor is it revealed by the letters that are the totems of the stars, but only by the stars.”We find in the above an exact parallel to the case of Parzival, for he findsthat “The Beatific Vision is no more, and the glory of the Most High is nomore. There is no more knowledge. There is no more beauty. For this is thePalace of Understanding; and he is one with the Primeval things.”He must wander about in the earth, tending the ROOTS of the flowers;unconscious of the results of his labours, until the time is ripe for another totake his place.The Third Act opens in the Grail’s Domain. We perceive a pleasant springlandscape and flowery meadows towards the back. In the foreground is a woodwhich extends away towards the right, and a spring of clear water. Opposite,and higher up, is a narrow hermitage built against a rock. It is Daybreak.All this brilliant spring scenery symbolises some of the work of Parzivalwho has laboured in darkness for many years. But the Night is nearly passed. Gurnemanz, now old and in the garment of a simple hermit, yet stillprotected by the Mantle of the Grail, is now discovered. He hears a lowmoaning which he recognizes as that of Kundry, who- half dead, but nowfaithful in service - has found her way back to the Mountain of Salvation.Intuitively she had been led to keep her tryst with Parzival whose last words toher had been: Thou knowest, where only we shall meet again. She is discovered by Gurnemanz concealed in a small thicket near thestream. How long she has waited there, who can tell, but the thicket is nowovergrown with thorns.Upon spying her, Gurnemanz cries: Up! - Kundry - Up! The winter’s fled, and Spring is here! Awake, awake to theSpring!The results of the unseen work of Parzival upon the “roots” of her beingsoon become apparent to Gurnemanz. Her first cry, on being aroused from herdeadly stupor, is: Service!But Gurnemanz - shaking his head - replies: Now will thy work be light! We send no errands out long since: Simples andherbs Must ev’ry one find for himself: ‘Tis learnt in the woods from the beasts.But Kundry, having in the meanwhile looked about her, perceives thehermit’s hut, and goes in. Gurnemanz, in surprise, remarks how different is herstep, and thanks Heaven that he has been the means of reviving this “flower”that had formerly seemed so poisonous."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23Kundry quietly returns with a water-pot which she takes to the spring,and while waiting for it to fill, she looks toward the wood and perceives astrange Knight approaching in the distance. She turns to Gurnemanz, whoseeing the same figure, remarks: Who comes toward the sanctified stream? In gloomy war apparel. None ofour brethren is he.For in his shroud of darkness Parzival - for it is he - is not recognized evenby Gurnemanz, a Companion of the Grail. It is not surprising that during hiswanderings those less enlightened should have failed to perceive his identity.He slowly enters, clad from head to foot in pure black armour; carrying,upright, the Sacred Spear, equipped with sword and shield. He seems dreamyand vacillating, but seats himself on the little knoll beside the stream.Gurnemanz, after observing him for some time, finding him silent,approaches somewhat, and remarks: Greet thee, my friend! Art thou astray, and shall I direct thee?In reply to which Parzival gently shakes his head, but remains silent.Further questioning only elicits from him the same silent response, for is it notwritten that UNDERSTANDING is pure Silence and Pure Darkness.But the end of this period of silence and darkness is approaching. TheNEMO stage of the “City of the Pyramids” soon gives place to another.Parzival rises and thrusts his Spear upright in the ground, thus, as it were,linking Heaven and Earth. He then slowly divests himself of the black armour.First he lays down his Sword (The power of Reason and of analysis), and hisShield (The heavy Karma of the World - his Pantacle). Opening his Helmet(which, being but a symbol of the Cup, has kept him in a darkness) he removesit; thus allowing the Wine of Sunlight to descend upon his head.He then kneels in silent prayer before the Spear, seeking conscious andenlightened union with the Will of the Universe. Hitherto he has been guidedby that Will, but has remained the while unconscious of Its direction, he nowseeks to participate more fully in the Great Purpose.While thus engaged in holy meditation, he is recognised by bothGurnemanz and Kundry. They also realize that he has obtained possession ofthe Sacred Spear, so long lost to the Knights of the Grail. Kundry turns awayher face, while Gurnemanz, in great emotion, cries: Oh! - holiest day. To which my happy soul awakes!Then, having arisen, Parzival recognises them in turn and greetings areexchanged. He can hardly believe that at last his path through error andsuffering has led him once again to that holy spot. For all seems changed."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24His one desire is to find Amfortas, whose wound had so long aroused hisCompassion and Pity, and which he feels it to be his mission to heal. This maybe accomplished by one means alone, the Sacred Spear by which the woundwas made.And all that while that Parzival - even with this high purpose in view - hadconsciously sought to return to The Mountain of Salvation, the path theretohad been denied him and he had wandered at random, as if:Driven ever by a curse: Countless distresses Battles and conflicts Drove me farfrom the pathway; Well though I knew it, methought.For the Road to Ecstasy is one above thought, and when Ecstasy returns itis as a Grace rather than as the result of our conscious efforts. Yet it is thereward of our “wanderings” if our Aspiration has been kept perfectly puremeanwhile.The Sacred Spear - The True Will - must not be used save for the highestends; and those ends do not become apparent to the conscious mind, till manya day after it has first been grasped and wielded to destroy illusion.Parzival: Then hopeless despair overtook me, To hold the holy Thing safely. In its behalf,in its safe warding I won from ev’ry weapon a wound; For ‘twas forbidden That inbattle I bore it: Undefiled E’er at my side I wore it, And now I home restore it. ‘Tisthis that gleaming hails thee here, - The Grail’s most holy spear.And then Parzival learns from Gurnemanz that he at last nears the end ofhis Quest, for he is already within the Grail’s Domain. He learns, too, of theanguish that has been suffered by Amfortas during his absence, and how theKnights had been disbanded because Amfortas no longer dared to unveil theHoly Cup. How Titurel, Father and Founder of the Order, had died - as othermen - when he no longer received the Grail’s enlivening beams.So Parzival, in intense grief, bemoans his foolish wanderings that seem tohave caused such disastrous results through his delay in returning to Monsalvaton his mission of mercy.But things could have not been otherwise. We should remember howNEMO tended his garden and how some of the roots writhed in anguishunder the acid or the knife, while others flourished by means of the oil.Had his Understanding not been Pure Darkness, his conscious mindwould never have allowed him to complete his Work. But such is the Mysteryof Redemption that these things must be in order that the final outcome maybe perfect."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25Sorrow and suffering are great teachers, and the Masters, having nopersonal ends to accomplish, are often the Instruments whereby our Karmacomes upon us. As pointed out in Liber IV.: “The contemplation of the Universe must be at first almost pure anguish. It is this fact which is responsible for most of the speculation of philosophy. Medieval philosophers went hopelessly astray because of their theology necessitated the reference of all things to the standard of man’s welfare. * * * The Ego-Idea must be ruthlessly rooted out before Understanding can be attained. There is an apparent contra-diction between this attitude and that of the Master of the Temple. What can possibly be more selfish than this interpretation of every-thing as a dealing of God with the soul? But it is God who is all and not any part; and every “dealing” must thus be an expansion of the soul, a destruction of its separateness. Every ray of the sun expands the flower. The surface of the water in the Magick Cup is infinite; there is no point different from any other point. Thus, ultimately, as the wand (spear) is a binding and a limitation, so is the Cup an expansion - into the Infinite. And this is the danger of the Cup; it must necessarily be open to all, and yet if anything is put into it which is out of proportion, unbalanced, or impure, it takes hurt.” But - “Ultimately the Magical Will so identifies itself with the man’s whole being that it becomes unconscious, and is as constant a force as gravitation.”Thus had the Spear - The Magical Will - led Parzival back to the Grail.But, after his long Quest, Parzival is weak and fainting, and this finaltemptation - the idea that after all he has FAILED in the Quest - causes him tosink down helplessly upon the grassy knoll.Kundry has brought a basin of Water with which to sprinkle Parzival, butGurnemanz, waving her off, says: Not so! The holy fount itself Befitteth more our pilgrim’s bath.And so, by the side of the Holy Spring (The Waters of the Great Sea -AKSHARA) they remove the greaves from his legs (giving him further freedomof action) and bathe his feet (Symbol of Understanding). They then remove hiscorslet (thus disclosing his Heart) and sprinkle him with the holy water.For there are Three that bear witness on Earth - The Water, the Blood andthe Holy Ghost (the Dove) and he that overcometh shall partake of the Watersof Life freely."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26Upon the contemplation of Kundry’s self-imposed task of bathing the feetof Parzival, he asks gently but wearily: “Shall I straight be guided unto Amfortas?” To which question Gurnemanz, whilst busying himself, replies: Most surely; there the Court our coming waits.He explains further that even he has been summoned to this Receptionsince, upon the death of Titurel, the long neglected office of the uncovering ofthe Grail is, by the will of Amfortas, once more to be performed.We should notice how, apparently by chance - for so seems the Design ofthe Universal Initiation of Humanity - all things have been prepared and areseen to lead up to the Crowning point of the Ceremony.Meanwhile, Parzival sits wondering at the marked change in Kundry, ather now humble attitude, so different from her former perversity; whileGurnemanz performs a further office in the ceremony of Purification bysprinkling the head of Parzival with the water from the Holy Spring.Purification being complete, is followed by Consecration, the second steptowards Initiation. Kundry is seen to take a golden flask from her bosom andto pour some of its contents upon Parzival’s feet. Taking the flask from her,Parzival then invites Gurnemanz to anoint his head with the same Holy Oil;his now clear vision causing him to remark: “For I today as king shall be appointed.”He makes this statement, which is no less than a prophesy of his completeattainment, as simply and naturally as a child.A few remarks should now be made on the nature of this Holy Oil and inregard to the source from whence it came. Liber IV will again supply the key,for therein we read: “The Holy Oil is the Aspiration of the Magician, it is that which consecrates him to the performance of the Great Work. * * * It is not the will of the magician, the desire of the lower to reach the higher; but is that spark of the higher in the Magician which wishes to unite the lower with itself.” The Oil, in this instance performs a double purpose, for it represents boththe awakening of the True Self of Kundry, and the desire for redemption. ThisHigher Self is represented by Parzival, and Kundry’s Consecration of Parzival isthe act which makes her redemption, by him, possible.Again:"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27“This oil is compounded of four substances. The basis of all is the oil of the olive, The Olive is, traditionally, the gift of Minerva, the wis-dom of God, the Logos. It is dissolved in three other oils; oil of myrrh, oil of cinnamon, oil of galangal. The Myrrh is attributed to Binah, the Great Mother, who is both the understanding of the Magician and that sorrow and compassion that results from the contemplation of the Universe. The Cinnamon represents Tiphareth, the Sun - the Son, in whom Glory and Suffering are identical. The Galangal rep-resents both Kether and Malkuth, the First and the Last, the One and the Many, since in this Oil they are One.” “These oils taken together represent the whole Tree of Life. The ten Sephiroth are blended into the perfect gold.” This will become clearer when the whole Drama has been treated from the Qabalistic viewpoint in the next Chapter. Again: “This perfect Oil is most penetrating and sub-tle. Gradually it will spread itself, a glistening film, over every object in the Temple.” In regard to this latter point we should observe what actually happens alittle further on in the Drama, but first notice one further quotation which hasa very direct bearing on the subject in hand. “The phial which contains the Oil should be of clear rock crystal (Rock Crystal is attributed to Malkuth - the Fallen Daughter, but in this case the flask is of Gold which represents the Breast, Sun or Tiphareth Sphere of the Son or Higher Self whose influence has been felt by Kundry) and some magicians have fashioned it in the shape of the female breast, for that is the true nourishment of all that lives. For this reason also it has been made of mother-of-pearl and stop-pered with a ruby.” In this connection we should note that Kundry produced the golden flaskfrom her bosom, for every detail of this Drama is symbolical.Next, Parzival very quietly scoops up some of the Holy Water from theSpring and sprinkles it upon Kundry’s head while she kneels at his feet - saying: I first fulfil my duty thus: - Be thou baptized, And trust in the Redeemer! At which Kundry bows her head and appears to weep bitterly.This is the first time that Kundry has been truly willing to receive thehigher help. She has done much, according to her own notions of service, butnow she is about to be led to Understand how best she may Serve; for trueMastery implies true Service."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28We should notice, too, the effects of the Holy Oil on Parzival. He turnsround and gazes with gentle rapture on the woods and meadows; whichrepresent his Garden, as we explained before. Gradually, he realizes the resultsof the Work he had carried on in silence and darkness. His memory awakensand he murmurs: How fair the fields and meadows seem today! Many a magic flower I’ve seen,Which sought to clasp me in its baneful twinings; But none I’ve seen so sweet ashere, These tendrils bursting with blossom, Whose scent recalls my childhood’s days,And speaks of loving trust to me.Gurnemanz attempts to explain this, saying: “That is Good-Friday’s spell,my lord!” Whereas Parzival, reminded of the darkness of his self-crucifixion andhardly yet realizing its full significance, replies: “Alas, that day of agony! Now surely everything that thrives, That breathes andlives and lives again Should only mourn and sorrow?”But Gurnemanz continues: “Thou seest it is not so.For: “The sad repentant tears of sinners have here with holy rain besprinkled fieldand plain, and made them glow with beauty. All earthly creatures in delight at theRedeemer’s trace so bright, uplift their prayers of duty. To see Him on the Cross theyhave no power; and so they smile upon redeemed man, who, feeling freed, withdread no more doth cower, through God’s love-sacrifice made clean and pure. Andnow each meadow flower and blade perceives that mortal foot to-day it need notdread; for as the Lord in pity man did spare, and in His mercy for him bled, allmen will keep with pious care, to-day a tender tread. So Trespass-pardoned Naturewakes now to her day of Innocence.”During this speech, Kundry has been watching Parzival with moist eyesand a look of beseeching, and he, now fully realizing the results of his work (forit is High Noon) remarks: I saw my scornful mockers wither: Now look they for forgiveness hither? Likeblessed sweet dew a tear from thee too floweth? Thou weepest - see! the landscapegloweth.And he kisses her softly upon the brow. Here the “dew of pure love”begins its wondrous action which brings all to perfection. Of this it is writtenin Liber IV. “There is, however, a universal solvent and harmonizer, a certain dew which is so pure that a single drop of it cast into the water of the Cup will for the time being bring all perfection."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29“This dew is called Love. Even in the case of human love, the whole Universe appears perfect to the man who is under its control, so it is, and much more, with the Divine Love of which it is now spoken. “For human love is an excitement, and not a stilling of the mind; and as it is bound to the individual, only leads to greater trouble in the end. “This Divine Love, on the contrary, is attached to no symbol. It abhors limitation, either in its intensity or in its scope.” Here we obtain the key to the errors of both Klingsor and Amfortas;together with the true solution of the problem, as obtained by Parzival. For thisLove leads on to ECSTASY, as the drama itself now shows us.It is MIDDAY, and just as the Sun is then at its height and full beauty, sowe find that Parzival’s travels have led him to complete the circle of hiswanderings, and in another moment, The Mountain of Salvation, like a greatRuby Jewel set in a Golden Ring, will shine out once more. Meanwhile,Gurnemanz and Kundry are seen to cover Parzival with the Mantle of theGrail, and he, solemnly grasping the Holy Spear and with Kundry at his side,prepares to follow Gurnemanz.Now, as if to prove out theory that Parzival had completed the Circle, wefind the scenery once again automatically changing, but this time from right toleft. It will be remembered that on the previous occasion, when for the firsttime Parzival entered the Temple of the Grail, this charge took place in theopposite direction. The passages through which they pass are similar, but as ifreversed. And this time all three traverse them together as if to symbolise theSacred Triad, the completion of which is about to take place.As before, there are chimes of bells. (The aspirant will notice similarsounds when entering the Higher Consciousness. They are sometimes called“The Voice of the Nada.”)Once more Time and Space are One, and the Tableau of the EverpresentHere and Now appears.Here we find Birth, Death, Life, Sorrow, Age and Youth mingled togetherin Harmony, Joy and Beauty. The vast Temple of the Holy Ghost - the lengthof which is from North to South, its breadth from East to West, and its heightfrom Abyss to Abyss, yet which is also the BODY OF MAN - is open to ourview.There is but a faint light at first. The doors open on either side andKnights bring Titurel’s corpse in a Coffin and Amfortas’ wounded body on alitter. The bier is erected in the middle of the Hall, and behind it is the thronewith canopy, where Amfortas is set down."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30Then comes a train of Knights bearing the Holy Grail towards thesheltering Shrine, where it is placed as before.Unaware of the approach of the Victorious Parzival, the Knights nowmurmur at the death of Titurel the honoured founder of the Order. For thisdeath, Amfortas appears to have been at least partially responsible, havingfailed for so long a time in his office to unveil the Grail. Yet he, having lost theSacred Spear - the Higher Will - entrusted to him by his Father, and havingfound the human will quite unable to take Its place, has in the meanwhilesuffered awful tortures through this failure to fulfil his true Purpose.The Knights, in despair, press towards Amfortas and demand that he - thisonce - unveil the shrine and do his office. Whereat, Amfortas in an ECSTASYOF FEAR, springs up and throws himself among the Knights - who draw back- while he cries: No! - No more! - Ha! Already is death glooming round me, And shall I yetagain return to life? Insanity! What one in life can yet stay me? Rather I bid ye slayme!For such is the Ecstasy of the Touch of Death the Twin of Love.(He tears open his dress.) Behold me! - the open wound behold! Here is my poison - my streaming blood.Take up your weapons! Bury your sword-blades Deep - deep in me, to the hilts! Yeheroes, up! Kill both the sinner and all his pain: The Grail’s delight will ye thenregain!But there is no DEATH in the Hall of Ecstasy. Birth, Life, Death are notsuccessive but One, for Time and Space are One.And so, at the moment of Amfortas’ greatest agony Parzival, theRedeeming Power, enters unperceived and unexpected.There is much truth in the old saying, “The unexpected is sure to happen”and this is more and more clearly realized as we tread the true Path. TrueEcstasy comes at the moment when all seems lost, for the partial and transientmust disappear and become lost, e’er the Real appears. “For to each individual thing, attainment means first and foremost the destruction of the individuality.” “Each of our ideas must be made to give up the self to the Beloved, so that we may eventually give up the Self to the Beloved in our turn.” — Liber IV. Suddenly the voice of Parzival is heard: One weapon only serves: The one that struck Can staunch thy wounded side."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31The countenance of Amfortas, upon his hearing these words, now displaysHOLY RAPTURE. He totters in ecstasy, while Gurnemanz supports himtenderly.Parzival: Be whole, unsullied and absolved! For now I govern in thy place.The True Will unhesitatingly takes its rightful place, and since that Will isone with THE WILL OF THE UNIVERSE, Amfortas without hesitationaccepts it.Parzival: Oh blessed be thy sorrows, For Pity’s potent might And Knowledge’ purestPower They taught a timid Fool. The Holy Spear Once more behold in this.And as all gaze in rapture on the Spear held aloft by Parzival, he continues,in inspiration, as he gazes at its Point: O mighty miracle of bliss! This that through me thy wound restoreth. Withholy blood behold it poureth, Which yearns to join the fountain glowing, Whosepure tide in the Grail is flowing! Hid be no more that shape divine; Uncover theGrail! Open the Shrine!Thus, and not otherwise, came Parzival into his own. The Temple of theChalice of Ecstasy is now, for him, The Palace of the King’s Daughter. For thusis it written: “When these shall have destroyed the Universe, then mayest thouenter the Palace of the Queen, my Daughter.” Then only shall we understandthe nature of The Bride’s Reception. For: “The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. Andlet him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take of the water of lifefreely.”Thus, and thus alone; amid Radiant Light, the Glowing of the Chalice ofEcstasy, the Rising of Titurel from the Tomb, the Death struggle of Kundry,the Homage of the Redeemed, the Praise of the Knights of the Grail, and aboveall the Benediction of the Dove of the Holy Spirit; is the final Workaccomplished - THE REDEMPTION OF THE REDEEMER."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32QABALISTIC CONCLUSION othing now remains but for the scribe to bear witness to the strangeQabalistic “coincidences” connected with this Drama.Was Wagner a great Qabalist? Were those from whom he obtainedthe sources of his information such? Who can tell?Rather I would suggest that, being inspired, this Drama must of necessityconform to all truth, on all planes. For there are certain NumericalEmanations, called the Ten Sephiroth, and there are certain Vibrations of anumerical nature connected with Words.It is not my intention to write a treatise on the Holy Qabalah (those whowish to study this interesting subject may do so in “Q.B.L. or The Bride’sReception”), nor to describe fully the “Tree of Life”, nor the methods ofdrawing numerical meanings from words. The accompanying plate shows thestructure of “The Tree of Life”, and the Frontispiece indicates how the“Chalice of Ecstasy” may be drawn therefrom.The Qabalistic teaching is that Malkuth - The Kingdom - The AnimalSoul - THE FALLEN DAUGHTER must be RAISED through the Office ofthe SON - Tiphereth - The Sun - Harmony and Beauty, to the Throne of theMOTHER - Binah - Understanding - THE CUP, when she is again united tothe FATHER - Chokmah - Wisdom - Will - THE SPEAR, thus absorbing allinto THE CROWN - Kether - The Pure Light of the DOVE which descendsupon their Union.This is the Mystery of Redemption and of the Great Work, the Uniting ofthe Microcosm and the Macrocosm - Man with God.The main Formula of the Great Work, that of the Rose and Cross, issymbolised in the Great Order as 5°=6°. This refers to the Microcosm and theMacrocosm as the Pentagram or Fivefold Star on Unconquered Will and theHexagram or Six-fold Star. The Work is to discover their equivalence, and tounite them.The first stage of this Union occurs in TIPHERETH, and is accompaniedwith the feeling of Ecstasy. This Sephira is that of the SUN, and is necessarilyconnected with the Solar Numbers of which 6, 66, and 666 are the Scale. Thisis the Sphere of the Crowned King - The Son who unites in himself both Gloryand Suffering.But since there has been, what we may term, a change of Office in theGreat Hierarchy in this New Aeon, we find that the Number 418 which is thenumeration of “ABRAHADABRA” the Word of the Aeon is also particularlyN"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33attributed to this Sphere, since it represents perfectly the formula of 5°=6°. (SeeSepher Sephiroth, Equinox Vol. I. Number VIII.)Again 777 is a number representing alike “The Flaming Sword” and theUnity of all things including the World of Shells. In Greek Qabalah itcorresponds to the word STAUROS - The Cross.It is worthy of notice, and most careful consideration, therefore, that withslight adjustment of spelling, the Names of the principle characters in theDrama have an extraordinary significance.TITUREL, Founder of the Grail Order, adds to 666.MONSALVAT, the Mountain of Salvation, adds to 666.GAMURET, the Father of Parzival, adds to 666.AMFORTAS, with his Cross of Suffering, adds to 777.KLINGSOR, who represents Choronzon (333) adds to 333.GURNEMANZ, Conductor of the New King, adds to 418.PARZIVAL, The Pure Fool, adds to 418.KUNDRY and GUNDRYGGIA, alike add to 290.In the above the Hebrew equivalents of the letters and the old spellings ofthe names are used. With small study of the Qabalistic System and the Gradesof the Order based on the Tree of Life, the significance of the above willbecome more and more apparent to the Student. An extended treatise might bewritten on the subject, but that is not the intention of the author at this time.Now, there are several spellings of the name Parzival; the one I haveadopted being that of Wolfram von Eschenbach, from whom Wagner derivedthe Drama. The usual spelling - Parsifal - is interesting since it adds to 388,which, with the addition of 500 (Final Mem. The Water of the Great Sea ofUnderstanding), becomes 888. By Greek Numeration 888 is the number ofJesus the Christ.But there is another spelling, much more significant, and probably theoldest of them all. PARCHVAL, the numeration of which adds to 326.It will have been noticed that the most important Points of the Drama areconnected with THE CUP - Understanding - Binah the THIRD Sephira; TheSPEAR - Will - Wisdom - Chokmah the SECOND Sephira, and THEHEART - The Castle of the Grail - Tiphereth the SIXTH Sephira. If weexamine these Spheres on the Tree of Life we find they form a DescendingTriad representing the Bowl of The Chalice of Ecstasy, the points of which are326.Now 326 is the Numeration of IHShVH - The Hebrew Jeheshuah - Jesus- The God- Man or Redeemer. This Word also symbolises the descent of“Shin” the letter of the Holy Spirit into the Four Lettered Word IHVH -"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34Jehovah - The Ineffable Name and the Formula of the Four Elements. ThusPARChVAL symbolises the whole process perfectly; the Descent of Spirit intoMatter and also of the Redemption.It also shows the transition to the New Aeon, there being a connectionbetween this old spelling and that of Parzival the formula of the present time.For the central letter of the word PARChVAL is “Ch” in Hebrew Cheth, whichspelt in full is 418 the numeration of Parzival, and of the Word of the Aeon, hisMagick Formula.I need only add that The DOVE - Kether - The Crown - when shownabove the bowl of the CHALICE (in its natural position on The Tree of Life)together with Yesod - the Foundation and Malkuth - The Kingdom, as thestem and base of the Cup; completes the Qabalistic Design. This arrangementclearly shows how the Chalice is one with the Tree of Life and filled by theHoly Spirit.The numerical proof is not, however, quite complete - indeed it couldnever be completed - but let me draw your attention to the word Grail. Theold spelling is GRAL and here we find G - the letter of The Moon - and R - theletter of the Sun, coupled with AL, the Great Name of God.Turning once more to our Qabalistic Design of the Cup drawn on theTree of Life, let us examine the Numbers of the Sephiroth involved. We shallindeed discover the “Chalice of Ecstasy” for we obtain 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 10 =31, which is the numeration of both AL and LA - God and Not- Key to theMysteries both of the Old Aeon and the New and when properly understoodthe Final Formula ofECSTASY.-o0o-"}]
