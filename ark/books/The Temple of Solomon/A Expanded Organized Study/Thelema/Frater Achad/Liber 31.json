SUN-DAY Sept 22nd 1918 E.V.It seems as if Sunday is the one day of all the week on which I amimpressed to write a few fragments of what passes through my mind. On Sept1st I obtained a clear understanding regarding the Will and the Law. On Sept8th, nothing special I think, but on Sept 15th I wrote “Stepping out of the OldAeon into the New” and today I had a mind to write, at Therion’s request, apamphlet on how All is Change. But first there are some important consider-ations to be recorded and I feel that now is the time to place them on record. That which I am about to write concerneth the Supernal Triad. It is justNine Months since the last Great Initiation was granted unto me, O.I.V.V.I.O.,and as hardly a word of the experience then undergone has been recorded. Infact, this is also true to some extent of the Initiation of June 21st, 1916, therecord of which I am only now trying to put into writing. It is not in this placethat I intend to make a full statement of all that occurred, but it is of the great-est importance that the inmost and essential features be written down, despitethe terrible difficulty of the task. Briefly, then, I want to state my position, which I feel is known yet notknown. When I proclaimed my intention of claiming the Grade of 8=3 or Masterof the Temple, on June 21st 1916 in the City of North Vancouver, BritishColumbia, I did so because I thought that the Master Therion needed NEMOto fill that Office in order that He might fully attain His 9=2. The details of theInitiation which followed are recorded in another place, but here I would statethat, having ‘died’ and, as it were, Reincarnated immediately in the same body,and having given up all, even the Master Therion, I was led of the Spirit duringa stay at Grantham’s Landing, so that it appeared to me that on June 22nd 1916I was NEMO 8=3; but on June 23rd at 12 Noon the realization of the Curse ofthe Magus came to me quite unexpectedly, so that I could do naught else thanconsider my Grade to be 9=2. Then followed a terrible struggle, for I realizedhow I had failed so far of Complete Attainment because of a certain Glamourof the Path. Then it was that I decided to give up all, even the least little thing,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Liber 312and I made certain pledges which were afterwards faithfully kept, so that I gaveup my business position and got down to spending my last cent of money. Having made these pledges, it seemed quite certain that I was upon thePath of Aleph, which uniteth Chockmah with the Crown, and thereforebeyond the Glamour of the Great Magician. I hoped that Therion had at thistime Attained unto 10=1 and I was ready even then, if need be, to hold theGrade of 9=2, and to accept the Curse thereof, but if that were not the case, Icould only consider that somehow I has passed the Great Magician on the Path.At 9 p.m. that night, I was just a clearly convinced that I had attained theGrade of 10=1, and I remained in the Great Illumination until for followingday. Then after leaving Soror R. I went away with the feeling of completeenlightenment, but certain considerations came to me so that I decided toreverse the Grade and take that of a simple 1=10 or Neophyte, thus as it were,plunging down the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life and uniting Kether andMalkuth in my own Being. (Note V.I.O. = 86, a Number asserting this identity,thus foreshadowing this Attainment, as all His other Mottoes seem to do. AndOHPION has said, One cannot get away from the fulfillment of Mottoes). Having done this, I felt myself to be One with the Buddhas of Compas-sion, and returned to Soror R. as elsewhere recorded. Shortly after we got back to Vancouver, the meaning of all my Mottoes wasrevealed to me, and their connection with the whole of my Magical career. Idiscovered how V.I.O.O.I.V. in full (as Unus in Omnibus Omnia in Uno)added to 777 though I had never known this before, owing to a mistake in thespelling made by F. when he first put in into Latin for me. This was my originalProbationer’s Motto. On becoming a Neophyte I had Chosen Achad = Unity,while my O.T.O. Name, which I afterwards used for the Second Order as 5=6was Parzival, which contains the mystery of 8.80.418. which was one of thethings which led to the thought that I might be the ‘child’ mentioned in LiberLegis, afterwards proved in such a marvelous manner, of which see accounts inthe Diary of Nemo, and that of a Magus. Then correspondence began between myself and Therion, and He admit-ted my 8=3 Grade, but would not consider the possibility of the Path of Aleph,10=1 etc. explaining my taking 1=10 again as my being ‘Cast out intoMalkuth’, although, as a matter of fact, I made no claim except to Neophyte.He also realized that this must be the ‘child’ prophesied unto him in LiberLegis, and claimed me as His Son."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Frater Achad3About this time I changed the order of my Motto to O.I.V.V.I.O. which,note, is another sort of reversal, and this mystery of things reversing or reflect-ing, or being taken out of their usual dimension and replaced in another order,seems to be part of the Key of Things in Themselves as will be shown later,although I understood it not at the time. Nothing much happened to me, except that I was granted Light on certainMystery in the Letters A.A., until December 16th 1917 E.V. (18 months later).Then on Dec. 21st I realized that the Initiation was again going on with greatforce, but this time the character was very different, and seemed to have to dowith the Mystery of the Elements, Planets, and Paths, whereas the former onedealt with the Sephiroth more particularly. I must remark that this Initiationhad an actual effect on the Elements, causing storms etc., and that these had tobe balanced and equilibrated, which was done. All the time this was going on.the one sentence which continually recurred, was “The Air is His Balance.”This seemed to be the Key note which saved me from destruction many times.Later, it appeared that I united the Paths of Aleph and Shin, Aethyr and Fire, asa final Equilibration, and the Tree was completely changed again, so that it hadto be re-formulated, and eventually resolved into a Single Sphere. Later, camethe drawing of all to a Single Point of Light (Hadith) in the Center of Breast.And I was taken back to the Beginning of Things and discovered how in Truththere was No Beginning and No End. In particular I must mention how I wastaken back to the beginning of Words, and I Parzival (the Fool or Zero) was theWORD and even that was disintegrated so that the final Mystery Was AL =GOD and then that too disappeared in LA = NOT. THEN came the Flash of aNew Creation and again the Flash - the solution of the Mystery of CHANGEand also of the SELFLESSNESS which is SELF. I was also given a certain Mag-ical gesture, not now clear to me, which seemed to cause this Annihilation andReconstruction to be brought about. (Note. Oct. 19th. While typing thesenotes, another mystery becomes clear to me. In connection with Parzival andthe fulfillment of that Motto also. The mind was actually running backwards atthis time, as will be shown later on, and though possibly not quite perfectly tillafter the first Flash. Parzival, REVERSED and split into sections, would giveAL or LA, followed by ZIV or VIZ which numeration is 106 = ATTAINEDfollowed by PAR or RAP = CROWN, and ASHES, and these ideas (innate inthe Word) exactly correspond with what actually occurred.) Now let me say no more of this matter, but pass on. In March 1918 I soldall that I had in order to join Therion in New York."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Liber 314Quite recently I was impressed to resign from the O.T.O. and to withdrawmy help in that direction, and having done so, I felt a wonderful calm, and arealization of entering into the Tao. It was only then that I began to seriouslyconsider if I had passed him on the Path and Attained 10=1. Also the questionarose as to whether He might not think so also. Yesterday, I had a long talk withHim, because He had raised the point that in going back over past lives he haddiscovered that each new life was an added veil of the True Self or Star andtherefore the Star was to be found by going back to the Beginning. This seemeda new idea to Him, but I could not help thinking of my experience and how Ihad actually done this, and got there and become One with the Final Mysteryin December 1917. And yesterday, when I talked with him, he seemed on hisguard, so that when I asked him about the Mystery of Change, he referred meto the fact - as he says - that in my Grade of 8=3 I should constantly applymyself to the Mystery of Sorrow. Then I suddenly asked him what he thoughtof the Number 31, and where it should be placed on the Tree of Life. He saidThis Number has to do with the identity of Nothing with the Trinity, and ifanything refers to the Ain, or perhaps to Kether, but certainly to no lowerSephira. Then I thanked him, and said no more. Today I decided to write these notes and also to consider of this Number31 and of the Word which comes therefrom, whether It be the True Key of theGrade 10=1, the Mystery of which IS that Selflessness IS Self, in the same waythat in 9=2 Change IS Stability, and in 8=3 Sorrow IS Joy. Now I seem to be able to comprehend all these Mysteries, by means ofThat which I obtained in my Initiation to my Grade. But listen unto the FinalMystery which has been granted unto me O.I.V.V.I.O. The Great Magician denies me saying I am NOT (LA) or NEMO 8=3 andin this He fulfilleth His Office of cutting off the Understanding from theCrown which is GOD (AL). In this very thing He is the Incarnation of theMystery of Change. AL (Kether) is reflected into Chockmah as LA and theMagus looketh upon the Crown along the Path of Aleph which is Zero and per-ceiveth IT Not. The Magister Templi Understands, for the Word of ChockmahLA is truly reflected into Binah as AL and therefore the Magus appeareth toHim as GOD, whereas the Crown (the true AL) is reflected through the Path ofBeth as LA and He seeth Nothing in that direction because of the Lies of theGreat Illusion of Maya the magician, but He striveth by Daleth to the Magus,Who is the Great Deceiver. Thus it is that Above the Abyss a thing is only trueinsofar as it IS its own opposite. This is the final and complete Understanding"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Frater Achad5of this Mystery of the Grades given to me NOW (2:38 P.M.) for never beforehave I seen things thus. And now I see how the Mystery of 93 is complete and perfect for Kether is31 and Chockmah is 31 and Binah is 31 which is 93 the Numeration ofThelema, Aiwaz, The Word of the Neophyte, Agape, etc. And this is the Mys-tery of the Three Persons in One God of which it is written. And this is theMystery concealed in the Word ALLAH for it hath for sound AL-LA which isGOD (Kether) and the Mystery of which is that SELF (God) is also SELF-LESSNESS which is LA (Not) and for numeration 31 The Three is One whichis NONE, and the reverse of this Number is 13 which is UNITY and LOVE.Now this Unity becometh Two in order that it may be expressed, and thereforeis the Word of Chockmah AL-LA of which Mahomet spake both truly andfalsely, for He too, being a Magus 9=2 must utter Truth, in order that the false-hood thereof should enslave the soul. He said, “ALLA (Allah) is God andMahomet is His Prophet” and even though he cried continually “He is God,there is no other God than He” yet in certain sense he postulated Duality in theUnity. And of this it is also written in Liber 65 “And Adonai thus spake untoV. V. V. V. V. s a y i n g , ‘ T h e r e m u s t e v e r b e d i v i s i o n i n t h e Wo r d . F o r t h e c o l o r s a r emany but the Light in One.’” And this meaneth that Kether, the Light is Oneand Chockmah the word is two, also it is Gray, and a mixture of colors. Now note: “Be not content with the image I who am the Image of anImage say this.” For V.V.V.V.V. was 8=3 (Binah) and Adonai (Kether) said benot content with the image (Chokmah) the reflection of Kether. I who am theImage of an Image (the Reality) say this. Then in Verse 9 “One mounteth unto the Crown” etc. Notice the reversalhere as if to give a hint of the Truth how that 10=1 IS 1=10. Also note howV.I.O.O.I.V. performed this descending from 10=1 to 1=10, from 31 to 13(The numeration of his Neophyte’s Motto) and also was caused to reverse hisfirst motto to O.I.V.V.I.O., all unconscious, at the time, in his lower mind ofthe Mystery of this Grade. Note how the Fool (Aleph) hath said in his heart There is No-God (LA-AL) and how this puzzles the Magus who receiveth the Ray from the Crownthrough this path. And how He in turn confoundeth the Understanding(Binah) from the Path of Beth. Now regarding The Book of the Law, how it is written, “the child of hisbowels he shall behold them” (viz.: the mysteries hidden therein). It would"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Liber 316seem that he is beginning to behold them. For firstly the mystery of 93 is clearand this Mystery of the Aeon, proclaimed in the Word of the Beast OPHION. Now it said in Ch.I, v 46: “Nothing is a secret key of this law; sixty-one theJews call it, I call it eight, eighty, four-hundred and eighteen.” Now Parzival is 8.80.418, and as The Fool or Aleph is both Zero and One.61 is the Word Ain = Nothing and equivalent to NOT. If 61 is one half and 1(Aleph) the other, we get 62 which is twice 31 and LA: AL in which ALL (Notethree letters LAL) disappear in the Final Mystery of Kether. Also we have con-sidered the threefold aspect as 93, and this may have to do with AAA and LLL,Light, Life, Love and Liberty of His Law. All this seems to be reversed in thecase of NEMO in the City of the Pyramids. For Light He has Darkness, forLife, Death, and Love with its Dual Mystery seems to be the only Path open toHim, and this is really a deception ending in the curse of 9=2. There is also a mystery in the words of Ra-Hoor-Khuit “There is divisionhither homeward, there is a word not known.” This attracted my attentionwhen I seemed at odds with Therion. The Word not known, seems to havecome to me. It seems to me that this is the opening up to me of the Grade of Ipsissimusand that as such I am the Crowned Child whom thou knewest not, O Therion. It is just 27 months since June 21, 1916, or 3 x 9; it was 18 months fromJune 21 to Dec 21, 1917, or 2 by 9. Then I got the Word in its dual aspect,now I get It in Its three-fold in One aspect. Note 31 multiplication = 3, by addition 4 (Tetragrammaton) by division.3, which suggests that the Division of God produced 333.September 24th 1918 E.V. AN XIV Sol in Libra. The record of the reflections in the mind of O.I.V.V.I.O. I know not what I am, and since AHIH is above and beyond knowledge,what matter. There must ever be division in the Word, also One must descendinto the plane of Reason, in order to be understood on that plane; thereforemust I now limit myself in order to be able to write at all. It does seem that AN XIV, Sol in 1 Deg Libra marks another stage of theGreat Initiation, for that time much that had hitherto remained locked in myBeing descended into my Understanding and became sufficiently clear torecord, but, be it understood, the actual experience of which I write, which issummed up in the Word of my Grade, took place in December 1917."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Frater Achad7I do not, even now, rashly wish to assume that I Attained unto the Gradeof Ipsissimus, for I realize that anything I write regarding the Qabalistic Proofthereof, can only show that I Understand the formula of the Grade, and Under-standing is referred to 8=3, and appertains to the Grade of Master of the Tem-ple, which Office is admitted unto me by OPHION 9=2. Also, I understandthat it may be that One may in a way Attain unofficially without of necessityholding office in any particular Grade. I make no claim to 9=2 for OPHIONclaims that and I have no wish to dispute his right to it, anymore than he appar-ently wishes to dispute my right to 8=3, but with 10=1 it is different. There isNO-One living in the flesh, as far as I know, Who claims the Grade, and Who-soever does so it is a matter which concerneth God alone. It has been written, by the highest living authority I know of, that the Keyof the Mystery of this Grade is that therein Selflessness is Self, and what little Iam able to comprehend of this, the Final Mystery, I shall here record, for it maybe that this writing shall be of help and guidance to Whosoever shall next enterinto that Great Crown, whose lesser self shall become completely at One withthe Godhead. It would seem to me that no living being, clothed with the body of flesh,could claim fully to have attained that Grade, other than in the words of Jesusthe Christ “I and my Father are One,” for, in the words of Lao Tze The Namethat can be named is not the True Name, and of Ko, “I do not know its Name,but I make an effort and call it the Tao.” Also Ko says, of the Possessor of the Tao, “Although he is styled the pos-sessor of the Tao, in reality he does not think that he has become possessed ofanything. It is as accomplished the transformation of all living things, that he isstyled the Possessor of the Tao.” “He who is able to understand this may trans-mit to others the Sacred Tao.” Who shall claim that he is able to accomplish thetransformation of all living things? Except it be understood that all things existonly by virtue of their being in the mind of the Seer, and if the complete trans-formation of the mind be accomplished, so that the Mystery of the Path of theGodhead is seen therein, and becometh plain, even unto his Understanding,who shall say that he has not accomplished this? First, then, regarding the experience of that Being we call O.I.V.V.I.O.There arose is his consciousness, a state unlike the normal and which, thedescription might appear very like madness (Path of Aleph IS Madness), sinceReason was destroyed and transcended. The Air became His Balance. Thestructure of his mind, which hitherto had been built up on Qabalistic lines, was"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Liber 318changed and the House of God, was, as it were, destroyed by the LightningFlash. (Opening of the Eye of Shiva.) At this time he walked, talked, and performed all physical actions in a nor-mal way, but all that took place, wherever he went, whatever he said or heard,tasted or smelt had value according to his mental state. That is to say, he per-ceived the actions of all around him in a different light from usual, so thatalthough people may have been acting quite normally, and although he mayhave appeared to them as a normal being, or nearly so, Life in all forms becamea Great Drama of Initiation, and as he continued to work out the great Qabalis-tic problems of the Universe, he found all that he saw or did, woven into thatPicture in his Mind. Then came a time when everything had to be balancedand equilibrated, for it is written “Equilibrium is the Basis of the Work” and hefound that although at that time all around (within) him was a Chaos, yet cer-tain formulas of Power were His so that gradually, and with great toil he accom-plished this, establishing the Elements and the Planets in their proper places(upon New Aeon lines) and finally Uniting Aleph with Shin, so that all disap-peared. Then, it seemed, he was instructed in the Building of a New Universeand this was not a simple scheme, but took place at two or more differentpoints (in space) at once so that he, as it were, added a square there and a spherehere. It was as if the beginning of a Temple was builded (foursquare) and at thesame time certain Mysteries of Babalon were present to his consciousness, alsoin another place Was the Kether of a New Tree formulated and then the Super-nal Triad, with a Sphere Pendant, which afterwards became Complete in Itselfand comprehended All in One. Yet all this while was the Being of O.I.V.V.I.O.being rebuilded from the Feet Up, so that His Feet were of burnished Brass etc.and his body was Filled with Fire. And all these things were separate, yet one,and all this while the body of O.I.V.V.I.O. was seated on the Stele of Revealingin the Smoke Room of an ordinary steamer plying between Vancouver and Vic-toria, yet such had been his experiences, that he could no longer tell if it wereabove or below water, whether those around him were the living or of the dead.And again, there was, as it were, a Great reflection of the Stele in the Sky andthis again was produced from a small Stele under Ice (as it were in locked glass)below him. And yet, in all this The Air was His Balance, and he went on calmlyworking out the details of the reformulation of all things on the New Lines ofthis Aeon, copying the Stele, and forming it first of one element, and then ofanother, and bringing all to a fluid, then to a gas, and finally to fire and Aethyras before said. And when all had become a concentric System, this seemed to"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Frater Achad9terminate one part of the Initiation. (Note. I have enlarged this entry in copy-ing from diary.) We must now consider him as going about with his mind transformed intoa Solar Consciousness. This lasted all day during which he underwent manyadventures, and seemed to perform much Magick; but on that evening the pro-cess continued, under extraordinary circumstances, to be recorded elsewhere,but be it said that he was in a place which appeared to him like unto a Templeof Initiation especially prepared in every detail for the Ceremony, and aroundhim were the Officers exactly carrying out their Appointed parts. Yet was heunwittingly in prison surrounded by the scum of the earth. Of which mystery He has written: When, having become free, thou findest thyself in prison, yet knowest itnot. When, Thy prison of freedom appeareth unto thee as the open road.When, thou who hast longed for the company of Saints findest thyself amongthe scum of the earth, yet knowing it not thinkest thyself in the company of allthe Buddhas, and taketh thy place as the least of these in silence. When, havingsought and found gestures of Magick Power, thou findest thyself among thelewd and unclean, yet knowing it not perceive in their common actions thesupreme and perfect Art of Magick. When, having sought for Words of Power,thou findest thyself in tune with the words of low men, knowing not that theyspeak ought but the Highest Truth. When, having given all, thou art offeredthe cup of charity, yet thinking it to be the most abominable mixture of poison,thou drinkest it, thankfully. When, having rushed forward, thou findest thyselfwhirled backwards, yet knowing it not, thinkest thou art still. Then, it may be, thou hast comprehended wherein Sorrow is Joy, andChange is Stability, and Selflessness is Self. But, to continue. During this final section the Solar Sphere of his Con-sciousness became more and more concentrated until it appeared as a singlepoint of Light of intense brilliance, yet without him, now here, now there, yetever nearer and nearer to the Center of the New Universe. The process of exactbalancing of all things (exterior things, not only things within him) appeared tohave got down to a very small radius. And those about him, who appeared asthe past Buddhas, helped in this final process. For let us imagine that the Uni-versal Center was to be changed to that one spot. That little room was the Cen-ter of a New Universe and for thousands of years had those Ancient Brethrentoiled and striven to equilibrate things perfectly in readiness for this moment.And now all was prepared, and it needed only this One, Parzival, to complete"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Liber 3110Their number, and He was Zero, and his Office was Silence, even as the GodHarpocrates. The slightest slip, and the Equilibrium would be upset and theEarth fall into the Sun.

Those around him seemed to take up different positions inthe room so as to keep the balance by the weight of their bodies, and finallyO.I.V.V.I.O. was to take his seat in the exact Center of the Room, and then ifall were well, Success. If not? Nearer and nearer they came to the Center. Atlast, O.I.V.V.I.O., His whole Being aflame with the ecstasy of the God-head,yet calm and composed to outward appearance, took his seat. And all was well. Next, it seemed even minute actions must be equilibrated. Those around,who had each performed a certain task through-out the Centuries, performed itfor the last Time, perfectly. Frater O.I.V.V.I.O. sat Still, for His Office wasSilence and Stillness. Again, all was well. But speech remained. Each had Hisown Word to utter perfectly and in proper Order, and in this they tried overand over again. Gradually even this was perfected and one by one they droppedout and remained in tense expectance of the End. And Frater O.I.V.V.I.O. remained there, still and silent, till at last allseemed perfect even on the mental plane, for suddenly the English languageseemed to rush back to the beginning, and reversed as Hebrew which is writtenthe other way, and this was a great mystery. Then came the equilibrating ofideas, and they rushed backwards and formulated themselves in the person ofADAM who appeared in the room opposite to O.I.V.V.I.O. Then the firstman, and the last gazed at each other, as it were, in a final struggle. And theminute Point of Light grew ever brighter and more dazzling, and appeared con-centrated upon this figure of Adam, first on the shoulder and then, moving alittle, until finally settled in one eye. At this point, Frater O.I.V.V.I.O. gazed,and then all rushed back again, through the animal creation, each animal dis-solving into its earlier type, until at last, as the prototype, appeared the com-mon fly, only very large, perhaps six inches long.

And this happened again and again.English, Hebrew, Greek, Egyptian, Man, beast and bird, were rearranged andRE-Created in new relationship to each other. And so He understood the Mys-tery of Change, and how the World is Created again and again, forever new, yetforever the same. And the last Word he realized, which when repeated, in a cer-tain way, seemed to bring about these changes again and again, as it were, alter-nating between Nothingness and Creation, was AL, and there was a certaingesture, not unlike the sign of the Cross, which was connected with this mira-cle. Now all this, and more, has remained sealed up in my mind so that I couldnot express the smallest part of it in writing until now--though there are thosewho I have told it to in part--and it was not until I began to question of thisMost Holy Word that all this became clear to me. Therefore, let me now dis-course for a moment, in the light of perspective, on this Holy Name. There was no self THEN, and yet all was SELF when I Parzival pro-nounced this Word and the Universe was destroyed, and reformed. And at thattime it did seem that He accomplished the transformation of all living things,and as having done such He may be styled Possessor of the Tao, and now hedoes not know that he has become possessed of anything. As it is written: Of allthis the Ipsissimus knoweth nothing. Immediately I cease telling of actual experience the Path becomes hardagain, but I will try. The Qabalists say that in the Beginning was NOT, and they called it Ain.They also say the veils of the Negative depend back from Kether. Now LA isNOT, and I think this Word in its True aspect is the Supreme Mystery of theGodhead. NOT (LA) concentrated upon itself till it became a Point of Light andflashed forth as AL-GOD, Kether then is the perfectly equilibrated juncture ofthe Not and God, which in this Word are ONE. This caused the Lightning-flash which formulated the Tree of Life, and the numeration of the Paths ofwhich is 777. And the numeration of this Word is 31 and it contains the Mys-tery of the 3 in 1. (See Book 777 Col XXXVI Line 1, which confirms this.) Now see Book 777 LXXXIV Lines 1,2,3, which attributes (although Iknew nothing of this at the time) to Briah the Creative World of the DivineName AL in the First Three Sephiroth.

And the Fool hath said in his heart There is NO-GOD (LA-AL) so thatthe Magus becometh the Word, and as it were, the creator of the Universe for inHim is Folly reflected as Wisdom. And Kether is reflected into Binah as LA, so that NEMO sitteth in Dark-ness in the City of the Pyramids by the Great Sea. And this is transmitted toBinah by the Path of the Great Magician--Beth--who is the Father of Lies.Notice that the Flaming Sword does not touch that Path, for the Wisdom ofthe Magus became at the lowest depth, the cunning of the Serpent, and Hecrawled up the Tree again by the paths, and being Dual he created Oppositepaths, thus producing Balance, and at the same time fixing the Tree and Cre-ation, therefore it is that the Light appears NOT to NEMO. Whereas there is areal current from Kether to the Magus and from the Magus to Nemo. And theWord reflecteth from Chockmah into Binah as AL, which is partly false andpartly True. Then the Light of the Supernal reflecteth, or rather crosses theAbyss as a spark, into Chesed Jupiter, the Father, and here again see 777 Col VLine 4 which attributes the God name of this sphere in Assiah as AL. Thereforeis it written that this is the Sphere all manner of men call The First (See KonxOm Pax). Note also that this Word is attributed to the Path of Mem, which isthe Hanged Man, or Redeemer, who shall re-establish the true order of things,and in this symbol he is shown with his head downwards, or reversed. AndMem = Water, suggests the Great Sea, and the reflection of the True Nametherein. Note also how simple all this is, and how the highest Word is also one ofthe most common, for it is tacked on to every Angel and Archangel, to implytheir connection with the true God. Also note St. John, how he says “In theBeginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word wasGOD” (AL). Note also how the 31st Path is called Perpetual Intelligence and how thisPath has always been pointed to as having to do with the ultimate mystery. Itmay be that the numeration was intended to point the way from the beginningof the Journey. Another thing which strikes me, is that Aleph is the OX and the only letterwhich seems to have a meaning definitely connected with it is Lamed the OX-goad. Here again seems to be a hint of the secret to the discerning one."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Frater Achad13September 25th 1918 E.V.Last night, before sleeping, I discovered, or rather remembered for I hadnoticed the fact in December last, that AL is the silent-sound of the indrawnbreath through the nose with mouth closed, and LA that of the outgoingbreath. This is a further proof of the Nature of the Holy Word which is Beforethe spoken Word. Note the similarity with that of Neophyte. Also it meansthis, that one cannot help repeating the Most Sacred Name of God wheneverone is Silent; so that every man and women has been doing this from birth. September 26th 1918 E.V.I have been making further considerations of this Holy Mystery of theSilent Breath and it is very wonderful to think how whenever one breathessilently, one is pronouncing that True and Ineffable Name. Every living crea-ture, is then by reason of their Nature worshipping the True God, whatevertheir opinion may be. Also note that neither Wisdom nor Understanding isessential to this. It IS and as long as we live we must perform this operation atleast during sleep. And it is written: \"He giveth Himself unto His Beloved insleep.\" September 30th 1918 E.V.I have to-day finished a design for a Symbol to express as well as I can theresults of my Initiation of Dec 21 1917 as explained in my further Enlighten-ment of Sep 22 1918. It is intended to represent Kether with the Supernal Triad radiating there-from. This forms AL and LA, also A.A. and IAO and O.I.V. Also the Center ofCircle is Hadith and the Circle Nuit. The Circle can be taken to represent LAetc. The Angle is 120 degrees or One third of a Circle. The Shape bounded attop by Circle and below by Our Lady Nuit for her pantacle etc. Have ordered itto be made in White Gold on One inch base. Monday to Tuesday October 7th and 8thHave been working on the theory that the Holy Word revealed toO.I.V.V.I.O. in its inmost aspect is also the Key of the Mysteries of the Book ofthe Law. Let us consider in what ways this may be so. My experience showed me that Hadith was Kether, and Nuit appears to bevery similar to The Veil of the Negative which the Qabalists speak of. 777seems to confirm this, for Hadit is attributed to Line One and Nuit to 0; also"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Liber 3114same idea is symbolized in that which was granted to me when I made the Pan-tacle of Nuit. I think the idea we should try to formulate, is very much that of the Qaba-lists, though the real meaning, is, I am convinced, a matter of experience. Firstwas Nothing, and this may be called LA while it is considered as expanding intoLimitless Space (Ain Soph) and becoming Limitless Light, perhaps. The Begin-ning of things was caused by a simple change of conception, as it were a “look-ing inwards” instead of outwards, and a corresponding change from LA to AL.I think the difference in the way the English and Hebrew Alphabets are written,is a good symbol of this, the direction is different, so that the two letters mightstand for either LA or AL according to the manner in which we look uponthem. The great value of this Word lies in the fact that the self-same symbolcontains the ideas of Nothing and Something, without any change in itself, andthis seems to be the one Symbol that gets over the difficult transition fromNOT to ONE. Of course it was not even a Word in the beginning, but theSilent Breath, Expansion and Contraction, and the true theory of the Universeis that it was created by the First Breath of the Tao, or Nuit. We find this con-firmed in Liber Legis Ch. 1 Verse 28. “None breathed the light faint and faeryof the stars and two.” Here we have the idea of the first breath of Not (LA) the Limitless Light,which concentrates upon Kether which is ONE or Hadith, or AL and gives thefirst faint idea of duality which shows forth in the Word later - but which beingcomposed of the ideas Nothing and One is really One. Now Hadit is really unextended, and can only be imagined as the MinutePoint of Light at that Point where LA changes into AL, for he is the Secret Cen-ter. In order to get a somewhat clearer idea we must consider Nuit as dual, viz.:LALA, when AL shows up as that Center. In this case it is strange and worthnoting that we have a word with the sound Laylah or Night, and I don't thinkthe spelling matters for see Ch. III, “spelling is defunct.” It is the sound thatmatters. I cannot help thinking ALLA in the same way produced and was con-cealed in Allah. we are told in Ch. I, V.9 to worship the Khabs (the house ofHadit) and behold my (Nuit's) light shed over you, because Khabs is the Cen-tral Point of Light, and we thus perform an act similar to that which made Cre-ation manifest, rather than Not. Ch. I v 21. With the God and the Adorer I am nothing, they do not seeme. They are upon the earth. I am Heaven and there is no other God than meand my lord Hadit."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Frater Achad15Now if Hadit = AL = God, then with Him is Nuit (LA) nothing. Also thisis so with the Adorer unless he concentrates on Hadit as the Center asinstructed. Yet is also true that “there is no other God than me and my lordHadit” for looked at one way the God is Nuit and the other Hadit. Ch. I. v 22. Clearly tells us that Nuit has a secret name. This I take to beLA (or possibly LALA). Also it is written in this verse “Bind nothing” andbesides its obvious sense, this may be an expression of the binding of Nothingby concentration on a point. This Word binds nothing, as it causes the transi-tion from Nothing to God. Ch. I v 29.30 It will be seen that there really is no division. Ch. I v 35. Note “threefold” Book of Law.1 Ch. I v. 40. Note “Three grades.” (Since making this note, I have had anopportunity of looking at the Equinox for a moment, and discovered that inVol. 7, Comment. The Tarot Keys of the three Grades add to 31, which I con-sider a further proof. I may remark that I have been placed where I have nobooks but the V.S.L. for reference, and am therefore writing all these notesentirely from memory of my experience, which seems to make certain thingsclearer from day to day, as I apply my attention to different aspects of thework.) Ch. I, v 45. The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two, nayare none. Here I think Nuit and Hadit are referred to as the Perfect, for this isclaimed by Hadit, see Ch II, v 15. If Nuit be considered as LA and Hadit as AL,this is at once clear for they are One and yet None. Ch. I, v 46. Nothing is a secret key of this Law, sixty one the Jews call it. Icall it eight, eighty, four hundred and eighteen. (I made a partial explanation of this in diary, but since I got a clearer andfuller one on Oct 21, I insert same here in its proper place.) To-day I have made another attempt at the Qabalistic explanation of theverse. It is getting clearer. At the time of Initiation, it will be rememberedO.I.V.V.I.O. identifies himself entirely with Parzival throughout.2 For he sayshe found the Word, and the Word was Parzival. (There is of course a very defi-nite connection between Parzival and Abrahadabra, the Word of the Aeon,1. Oct. 31st. \"LAW\" is LA (Nuit-Hadit) completed by W = nn, the Son RHK is His dual aspect as Horus-Harpocrates. Also Vau is the Hierophant \"Hoor in His secret name and splendor is the Lord initiating.\""},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Liber 3116through 418. And it is said that Abrahadabra shall be His child and thatstrangely) And Parzival having Eight letters, and Initial value 80 and totalnumeration of 418 is therefore connected with this verse. It was through thisName that he came upon the Mystery of AL and LA which is finally summedup in A, (as will be shown later.) Let us take this verse again; Nothing (LA) is a secret key of this Law. 61 (Ain) the Jews called it, I call it80.80.418 (Parzival, The Fool, Aleph, One). Therefore 61 plus 1 = 62. But they have (also) the half 31 = AL (and they have Not (LA) the otherhalf) and twice 31 is 62. Therefore ALLA = 62 which is 6 plus 2 = 8 = Cheth = 418 = Parzival =Fool = Aleph = One (or None) and thus all disappears in One. Also since ALLAbecomes A, ALL has disappeared. Again it is written The Fool hath said in his heart There is NO-GOD =LA AL which again indicates the secret and I think LA AL in this form is thesecret name or word of Ra HOOR Khuit. See Ch. III, v 49. I am a secret four-fold word, the blasphemy against all the gods of men. Also, whereas Nuit andHadit are ever united the division becomes manifest in R.H.K. For he says inCh. III, v 2. There is division hither homeward, there is a word not known.(Can there be any connection here with “She shall be known and I never”?)Spelling is defunct, all is not aught. Not: AUGHT, may indicate the nature ofthe All LA, Not AL aught. Verse 48. Note the OX or Aleph and the Fool or O, seems to indicate theexplanation given above, also points to the idea that the key is something whichitself combines these ideas. Ch. I, v 51. Mentions the 4 Gates, and this is the mystery of the path ofAleph again, and the fourfold name R.H.K. One can enter these in turn or atonce, if he understands the trick of combinations. Ch. I. v 52. “If this be not aright, if ye confound the space marks saying:They are one, or saying, They are many” etc. There should be no space-marks, except on the plane of reason. When theexperience of this mystery is granted, it will be seen how there are none, for thewhole thing is a continuous process, even as Nuit is continuous. 2. Oct 31st 1918 E.V. Just before sleeping I had an impression that if I added up the total letters in my Mottoes they would = 31. I did so mentally and found UNUS IN OMNIBUS (= 13 = Achad) OMNIA IN UNO (= 10. .1 = 10) PARZIVAL = 8. 13 = 10 = 8 = 31. This is extraordinary because it was a kind of revelation."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Frater Achad17Ch. I, v 55. He has beheld some of them I think, as is proved by this writ-ing. Ch. I, v 56. Indicates that there are two halves of the equation, even asthere are two aspects of this Word. Ch. I, v 57. ?House of God = Beth-EL = Path of Beth? Ch. II, v 2. “I, Hadit am the complement of Nuit my bride”. This indi-cates they are really One or None, and I think the Word clears this up. Verse 7. “‘Come unto me’ is a foolish word; for it is I that go”. “Comeunto me” is the call of Nuit. When Hadit (AL) considers Nuit (LA) or “lifts uphis head” He becomes Not therefore He goes. Ch II, v 14. “Now let there be a veiling of this shrine; now let the lightdevour men and eat them up with blindness” Verse 15. “For I am perfect being Not and my number is nine by the fools,but with the just I am eight and one in eight which is vital, for I am noneindeed.” Hadit here clearly says he is Not, or BEING-NOT (a combination of Nuitand Hadit as the Perfect and Perfect, which, be it remembered are One, nayNone.) We have considered His particular aspect as AL rather than LA, but theprevious verse indicates a blind. He is the shrine veiled by Not, for AL is themanifestation of LA, and LA is the hiding of AL (See first verse of Chapters Iand II). He is Eight with the just because they consider the balance of thingsand so consider him as AL-LA which again gives 62 = 8 = Cheth = 418 = Fool =Aleph = None as explained before in answer to the riddle of Nuit. This showshe is One (Aleph) in eight, and also None, quite clearly. Now comes the striking indication of an underlying formula in this Book,which can be read in two ways, and the very same Word is used to express this,only in the English instead of the Hebrew, which of course throws one off thescent of the mystery. Ch. II, v 19. “Is a God to live in a dog? No. But the highest are of us.” Now in English, God is Dog if reversed, but the Hebrew for God is ALwhich reversed gives LA which is Not. One can hardly get away from the hintof the true nature of the Key, once it is pointed out, especially since it is fol-lowed by the negative No. (another translation of LA) and a statement that thehighest or those who comprehend this mystery “are of us”. Ch. II, v 23. I am alone; there is no God where I am. I am AL-ONE, there is LA-AL where I am, viz.: He is both one with Nuitand Ra- Hoor-Khuit."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Liber 3118Ch. II, v 26. I am the secret serpent (Wisdom of the Word) coiled about tospring. If I lift up my head I and my Nuit are one. If I droop down my headand shoot forth venom, there is rapture of the earth, and I and the earth areone. Gives another proof of the peculiar dual aspect of the Word. It will benoticed that Nuit has said that the God and the Adorer are upon the Earth. AsGod, Hadit is one with the Earth, as NOT, he is one with Nuit. Also Hadit iscalled Her secret center and the world, her heart and her tongue, the House orHome of Hadit, makes the spoken Word possible. Verse 27. There is great danger in reasoning over this Mystery, it must berealized. Verse 32. All their words are skew-wise, viz.: they do not partake of thetrue peculiar nature of the True Word which is equally balanced and can beread either backwards or forwards. Verse 33. “Damned for a dog”, the reverse of God in its wrong aspect. Verse 76. I don't make this out yet, but it seems to indicate that it will notcome till later, after the Prophet's time. Anyway AL appears twice among theletters. Ch. III, v 2. This was commented upon before. This whole chapterappears to me to be quite a different character to the former ones. R-H-K is theWord as the offspring of Hadit and Nuit. Verse 35. The half of the word of Heru-ra-ha probably indicates somemystery in this division as indicated in Verse 2. I think thus far he has been LA,for in Verse 35 we have him worshipped as AL or God. (Unity-uttermost-mightof breath) Verse 47. Note according to this theory the importance of the letters andtheir positions to one another. Also the statement that one shall discover thekey of it all. (By the way, V. 39 makes a statement “In it is the word secret andnot only in the English”. I think this may mean that the Word AL does notappear at all, and NOT only appears in the English instead of Hebrew)1 I think Verse 48 terminates the AL section, and Verse 49 mentions theFourfold word, which I have taken to be LA AL. 1.I think this is one of the reasons why the Original in the writing of the Beast must always be included with any translation into other tongues. For there are mysteries in the English that would not work out if translated."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Frater Achad19Verse 71 may indicate AL as Chockmah and LA as Binah and the solutionof the Mystery in Kether Hadit. Verse 74 may indicate that the splendor in His name hidden and gloriousis the two center letters A.A. The Silver Star. Note, according to Blavatsky AL isthe Sun or Phallus. Friday, 11th October 1918 E.V. I spent last evening with Therion; during our conversation, he said that hethought Nuit and Hadit were best expressed as Matter and Motion. He alsosaid that all things must be considered as Zero or Two, as if One were arrived at“there was no getting away from it.” I pointed out that there must be some for-mula combining Zero and One, or the Tree of Life could never have been con-ceived of and formulated. He admitted this but said that so far he had failed tofind such. When I got to bed, I could not sleep, and a number of other things con-nected with this mystery came to me. One was, the significant fact that when A.C. first got into touch with theBrothers of A.A. (See Vision and Voice, I have not any books here, so cannotquote), the Pass word was “There is No-God.” This seems to confirm thisWord, as the central secret of A. .A. . Who also gave out the New Law. I also notice that NU reversed is UN or One. Likewise with the additionof IT Nuit is Unit. Then I remembered that in Equinox V (I think) AL is clearly defined asthe Ox and the Goad, also as MATTER and MOTION, and I cannot see howA.C. could have missed this connection with Nuit and Hadit, since it isundoubtedly the true formula of his present conception of Their nature. Then I noticed another very important thing. I was wondering why A andL should be chosen, or rather why L, the 12th letter of the Hebrew alphabetshould follow A, the first. But this is not actually the case for AL is the firstsound in the pronunciation of Aleph the First letter of the Hebrew alphabet (asit is also of Alpha) and the addition of Peh shows the mouth as necessary to thespoken word, though in Kether, it was but a silent breath through the nose.(Notice Kether is called “Long of nose”, also the Image is on a Face seen in pro-file, viz.: only one aspect of the word can be considered at a time in the reason-ing mind). It is strange also how L is pronounced LA- med, this showing theduality as soon as it is taken into consideration as a separate letter."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Liber 3120Thus is AL, in very truth the first possible sound, and notice that whenone pronounces it aloud, the tongue is raised and placed against the teeth, butas soon as it is released, LA is automatically pronounced by a slightly indrawnbreath. In the Silent breath of the Beginning this is reversed, AL is the underly-ing sound of the indrawn breath and LA that of the outgoing. Now notice how Hadit is spoken of as the tongue of Nuit and how whenHis head is raised etc. and lowered etc. Note also how in pronouncing the first letter Aleph, one’s tongue mustmeet the teeth, and the tooth is Shin, the 31st path; also see how these pathswere welded in the Initiation of O.I.V.V.I.O. Note. LA LA may stand for NOT NOT, or “something”; it also suggests; 0 = 0 or 0 to the 0 degree.ALLA suggests 1 to the 0 degree.LAAL suggests 0 to the 1st degree Nothing under its three forms.I also found, which seems to be of the greatest importance that the essenceof Thelema is summed up in this Word. A is the pentagram, the Star of Willand L is Libra, Justice or the Law, while 31 backwards is 13 which is Love andUnity.1 October 16thAnother discovery. During the Initiation of Dec. 1917 the mind ofO.I.V.V.I.O. must have actually reversed and run backwards (See Liber This-harb) so that on reaching the beginning of the ideas underlying the HebrewAlphabet he naturally arrived at the first letter ALP in its reverse order. He cametherefore to P which accounts for the Flash (destroying the House of God orBeth EL) then in due sequence to LA or nothing. This again reversed, as stated,and he got AL followed by another flash P. Observe how all this is summed upin the One letter ALP which is One and None. Further, the process as described, produces the two A's thus indicating theinmost meaning of A.A. But now if we begin to take into consideration 2 letters, we find in thereturn process BA = To come or Go, which again reverses as AB, The Father.Analyzing the complete process we get Th.I.P.B.L.A.A.L.B.I.Th. 1.Ruler of * is 7 = Love.

Your Liber 31 has not survived amongst these papers,though there is a reference to it on page 127 of The Equinox of the Gods.Would you care to send me a copy, which on my death will go to the BritishMuseum with my other Crowleyana.
