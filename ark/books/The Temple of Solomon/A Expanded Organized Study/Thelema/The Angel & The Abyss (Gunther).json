Daniel Guntherprovides a detailed and cohesive analysis ofthe two major spiritual crises in the career ofthe aspirant in the Aeon of the Child—theKnowledge & Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel and the Crossing of the Abyssbetween the divine realms and the human.Expounding on the sublime Formulas ofInitiation confronting those who would aspireto these Mysteries, the author draws deeplyfrom Jungian psychology, world mythologyand religion, and the doctrines of the classicMystery traditions, explaining how therevelations of Thelema apply to the individual.In 1904, The Book of the Law declared theadvent of a new period in the course of humanhistory—the Aeon of Horus or Aeon of theChild. The doctrine of this New Aeon, codifiedin the Book of the Law and numerous otherHoly Books, is known as Thelema (a Greekword meaning “Will”). Aleister Crowley wasrevealed as the Prophet of the New Aeon.The Angel & The Abyss is written in clear,precise language that will aid those studentswho seek to navigate the difficult terrain of thisadvanced stage of the Spiritual quest. Moreknowledgable students will find tantalizingclues to serve as guideposts and eventualconfirmations of their direct experience."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Psychiatrist Carl Jung developed a depth psychological system whichembraced the totality of the human experience. The two cornerstonesof his theory remain the idea of the collective unconscious, and theTranscendent Function. The former is the storehouse of universalsymbols to humanity, the latter is the transformation to thetranscendent synthesis after an experiential battle of the war of theopposites [thesis, and antithesis, respectively]. J. Daniel Gunther’sopus demonstrates the depth and power of both of these ideas in therealm of spiritual initiation. Each chapter resonates with a harmoniccreated by the archetypal frequency of the Hebrew letters,themselves representing paths on the Tree of Life. Although Thelemicin tone, this resonance encompasses ideas from the major worldreligions, and thus a perfect example of the collective unconscious inaction. The union of opposites concept permeates every chapter,beginning with life and death as primary oppositions. Jung wouldhave recommended a special active imagine process, especially withdream related material from the unconscious, to provide the setting,space, and energy for the opposites to interact and eventuallytransform. Such is the format of each chapter of the text, an activeexploration of the opposites exemplified by harmonic energy of thePath. The task of synthesis is partially the goal of the author toexplicate, but the true synthesis occurs in the reader after deepcontemplation of the ideas presented. This is the power of theTranscendent Function in book form: the transformation of the readerwho exerts the time and effort to experience the material within. Thisheartfelt explication of Crowley’s work is enlivened by the core ofJungian thought used throughout the exploration.Gregory P Brown, MD Associate Professor University of Nevada School of Medicine Psychiatry Department"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"First edition published in 2014 by Ibis PressAn imprint of Nicolas-Hays, Inc.P.

Daniel Gunther’s earlierwork, Initiation in the Aeon of the Child (2009). That was Book I ofTHE INWARD JOURNEY series. The Angel and the Abyss comprisesBooks II and III: “The Angel and the Abyss” and “The HieroglyphicTriad.” This new study continues the discussion about the Initiaticimpact of Thelema, and in particular the Initiatic system and formulaeof the A A. Together Books I-III correspond to the functions of theOuter, Inner and Supreme Orders of AA in the three-fold processof Initiation that Gunther calls the Path of the Great Return.The Angel and the Abyss and Initiation in the Aeon of the Child are arecord of Gunther’s efforts, spanning decades, to faithfully preserveand implement the original system of the AA as established byAleister Crowley. That it also includes some of the oral instructions ofthe modern AA points to what I think Crowley and the Order’sorganizational design anticipated—ongoing contribution to theuniverse of discourse and literature based on Scientific Illuminist rigor.At times Gunther’s thesis is astonishing. To paraphrase O.T.O. FraterSuperior Hymenaeus Beta’s comments on Volume I, The Angel andthe Abyss rises in some passages to levels of transmitted doctrinalinsight.Generally speaking, THE INWARD JOURNEY series details the averseqabalistic schema of Initiation in the AA. In terms of the formula oftetragrammaton, the task of the Candidate is to set the Daughter(Heh final or Malkuth) upon the Throne of the Mother (Heh Prima orBinah). This in turn awakens the Eld of the All-Father Chokmah (Yod)—with the reunion of Yod the All-Father and Heh the All-Mother beingthe Perfect and the Perfect uniting to form One Perfect in Kether,which is None. Gunther terms this attainment to a condition ofNothingness, Nulliversion. THE INWARD JOURNEY series is basically anexposition of this supreme formula. The Devil is in the detail however,and Gunther offers it in eloquent and earnest abound. I wouldencourage the reader to work through Books I–III sequentially, and tofollow the author’s advice when offered on how best to study anygiven passage or chapter. While the content of Initiation in the Aeon"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"given passage or chapter. While the content of Initiation in the Aeonof the Child and The Angel and the Abyss builds sequentially, it oftenoverlaps and interpenetrates, enabling formulae to be revisited frommore advanced perspectives as you progress through the books.The Angel and the Abyss continues the work of Initiation in the Aeonof the Child. That book was largely concerned with the taking up ofthe Great Work: how the Candidate to Initiation commences thejourney as Asar (Osiris), asleep or dead among the Qlippoth, andawakens as Asar-un-Nefer (“Myself made Perfect”). It then describesthe new life of the aspiring Adept, made one with the self slain Ankh-af-na-Khonsu, who as Hoor manifests the disciplined motion of theFifth Power of the Sphinx, IRE (“to Go”).The Angel and the Abyss now resumes the journey with the work ofthe junior and senior Adepti, the Babe of the Abyss, and the Magister.Perhaps most importantly, THE INWARD JOURNEY series sets forth thefundamental perspective of Initiation in the new Aeon: that theCandidate to Initiation is not the passive victim of a catastrophic deathrequiring suffering and resurrection, but an active participant in a self-chosen and self-slain Death that gives rise to a new Birth. By showingin Initiation in the Aeon of the Child how this doctrine emanates fromThelema’s identification of the sacred mountain of the Adepts,Abiegnus, with the City of the Pyramids, Gunther prepares the readerfor The Angel and the Abyss. The central theme of the new book isthe opening of the Fifty Gates of Death and the Birth of the Master ofthe Temple.The Angel and the Abyss can be viewed as a book about thetransmitted Knowledge or gnosis of Life and Death in the Aeon of theChild. The reception of this gnosis equilibrates the doctrinal imageryand message of the Holy Books of Thelema, the spiritual evolution ofthe individual, and the corporeal formulae of the Rose Cross, as Onein the psyche of the Initiate. It is from this perspective that Guntherwrites. When Crowley described the new Aeon as “the worship of thespiritual made one with the material, of Horus, of the Child, of theFuture,”1 this i s what he was getting at. Crowley went on to say, “Thischild Horus is a twin, two in one. Horus and Harpocrates are one, andthey are also one with Set or Apophis, the destroyer of Osiris. It is bythe destruction of the principle of death that they are born. Theestablishment of this new Aeon, this new fundamental principle, is thegreat work now to be accomplished in the world.”2 The Ang el and the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"great work now to be accomplished in the world.”2 The Ang el and theAbyss is an exposition of this new fundamental principle.As its title suggests, The Angel and the Abyss addresses thepreparation, passage, formulae, ordeals and tasks surrounding thetwo critical attainments in the system of the AA—the Knowledgeand Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel and the Crossing of theAbyss. In the forums and pages of cyberspace and Thelemic socialmedia, these attainments are often commented upon, yet the easeand lure of popular comment can result in them beingmischaracterized and misrepresented, potentially misleading newstudents and confusing even experienced practitioners. Guntherbrings to these difficult and recondite subjects a clarity and franknessthat exudes conviction. The work of the junior and senior Adepti arealso discussed—such as the Hieros Gamos, the Sleep of Siloam, andthe encounter with the Four Great Princes of Evil. With the crossingof the Abyss and the casting out of the newly born Magister Templifrom the City of the Pyramids, Gunther’s treatment of the Arcanum issometimes subtle and sublime, at other times intoxicating andintense. At all times howeve r, it is inspiring and encouraging. In bothmanner and method, the New Covenant of the Open Way is laid forth.There is also concomitant doctrinal discussion on the Thelemicmysteries associated with these stages of the Great Return (forexample, on the Kerubic shift, the Thelemic Pentagrammaton, theThelemic Trigrams, and the Secret of V).If my précis here has been brief and matter of fact, it is a candor bornof humility not frivolity. Put simply, these subjects are some of themost sacred in the canon of Thelema. “Loose thy shoe from off thyfoot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy.”Although The Angel and the Abyss can be heavy and heady, Guntherapproaches the study as an experienced teacher. He writes like helectures, always ensuring the student understands where the subjectlies in the historical and philosophical matrix of the Western Tradition.As with Initiation in the Aeon of the Child and in similar methodologyto Crowley, Jung, Corbin and other scholar-mystics, Gunther crafts anew vocabulary and literary style in The Angel and the Abyss. Asmuch an intellectual as psychic necessity given the hyper-Abyssiclogic of the Supernals, a new vocabulary helps the reader to bring theunfamiliar into focus, and awaken the reader from the unconsciouslimitations and attachments of his or her habitual thought patterns."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"limitations and attachments of his or her habitual thought patterns.Crowley instructed that the Student of the Mysteries had to armhimself with a new kind of logic.3 He was referring to t he Mystery ofthe Supernals—not without its place in this book—and Gunther’sstyle helps bring it into a focus, free of the habitual.A key component of this vocabulary is its underlying semiosis inEgyptology and the Egyptian hieroglyphs. Gunther brings thesemotifs and their archetypal template to life, as signposts of THEINWARD JOURNEY, as if to assert that the rituals of the Pyramid Textsand the Book of the Dead were rituals that were practiced in life, notjust recited for the dead, 4 with continued practical si gnificance andmeaning in the Aeon of the Child. Gunther’s study of hieroglyphshelps the reader appreciate the archetypal imprint of the theogony ofHoor, its religio-historical evolution, and its direct relationship to theformulae of Initiation and practical magick in the new Aeon.Another key feature of the book’s vocabulary is its location inanalytical psychology, and from that perspective, alchemy. Gunther’sAeonic psychology (my term) provides the intellectual substrate forTHE INWARD JOURNEY—a way of conceptualizing and contextualizingthe process of Initiation and the operations of the Initiate in relation tohumankind’s collective spiritual or psychic evolution. Depthpsychology and active imagination’s awakening of the Spirit (uniomentalis), coniunctio with the daemonic Angel (unio corporalis), andthe departure of the daemon for the terror and taboo of the Ego’sdestruction (its functional orientation to Self incarnate), in order toreturn or unite with the world (unus mundus), resembles the threefoldprocess of Initiation—Neophyte, Adept, Magister—at least in terms oftheir metanoia (mental transformation). It suggests there areconnections, and by bringing the disciplines together, Gunther’ssynthetic approach can have a transformative and constellating effecton the reflective reader. THE INWARD JOURNEY series is one of themore visible studies incorporating the thought of Crowley alongsideJung, of Initiation alongside the new Aeon therapeutic science ofIndividuation. Perhaps by default, it suggests that syntheticapproaches to these disciplines may well provide the mostsatisfactory scientific language and method for the study of Initiationin the future.The Master Therion considered the Knowledge and Conversation ofthe Holy Guardian Angel the Next Step in humanity’s journey.

The Qliphoth,from the Hebrew , “husks, bark, shells,” are those who presidein the world of the profane, which we sometimes call “the old greyland.” The Qliphoth personify the impure components of the humanpsyche, hence the unbalanced Tree of Life. Candidates must risefrom this life of disorder and confusion so beloved by the masses anddedicate themselves to an alternate life, a life of perseverance andservice to the Great Work. Liber Porta Lucis2 describes how the onsetof this journey may seem to our friends and family:Even as a man ascending a steep mountain is lost tosight of his friends in the valley, so must the adept seem.They shall say: He is lost in the clouds. But he shallrejoice in the sunlight above them, and come to theeternal snows.3 In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, there are many epithets give n forOsiris that characterize elements of his nature and symbolism. Threenotable ones are, (wršš m db3t) “Time-spender in theTomb,”4 (wrdw ) “Weary One,”5 and (wrdw -ib)“Weary-hearted One.”6In Liber LXV, Chapter IV, verses 28–29, we see that aspirants toinitiation in the New Aeon are clearly identified with Osiris the Weary-hearted One, struggling against the sleep of death in the world of the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"hearted One, struggling against the sleep of death in the world of theQliphoth:Weary, weary! saith the scribe, who shall lead me to thesight of the Rapture of my master?The body is weary and the soul is sore weary and sleepweighs down their eyelids; yet ever abides the sureconsciousness of ecstacy, unknown, yet known in that itsbeing is certain. O Lord, be my helper, and bring me to thebliss of the Beloved!Again, in Chapter V, verse 61, the same terminology occurs:And the Lord Adonai delighteth in me, and I bear the Cupof His gladness unto the weary ones of the old grey land.With experience of the Neophyte Initiation, wherein we drink from theInitiator’s Cup of gladness, Asar awakens as Asar-un-Nefer,(Wsir-wn-nfr) “Myself made Perfect,” and casts off the swathings ofthe corpse that bind the limbs, that he may set out upon the road ofeternity.In order to go forth upon that unending Inward Journey, Aspirantsmust reject the death grip of the world, whic h hides its inherentfatality behind the mask of “the good life.” This must be a consciousand deliberate choice, for the pull of the world is strong, and thejourney arduous. Yet, those who do make the choice to follow thePath of AA have the collective strength of the Great Order to aidthem, and those who endure receive a blessing thereby.We can find a parallel to this admonition in the Gnostic Book of Ieouwhere it is written that Jesus said unto his apostles,Blessed is he who has crucified the world, and who hasnot allowed the world to crucify him.7Thus, the next step in the progression of the Initiate is found in thegoal of the aspiring Adeptus: to embrace a Life which to the world isas Death. Candidates should keep in mind Crowley’s advice in BookIV, Part III: “It is wrong to say triumphantly, “Mors janua vitæ, unlessyou add with equal triumph, ‘Vita janua mortis.’”8Mors J anua Vitæ"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"For the candidate to the Mysteries, fixation solely upon mundaneaffairs is that deadly sleep from which he or she must awaken andbegin to shake off the shackles of torpor and inertia. It is intrinsic tothe makeup of aspirants to the Mysteries that the Life worth living is tobe found only in the disciplines of the Path of Initiation—the rigorsand demands of which appear to the uninitiated as the yoke ofslavery and loss of freedom. The dichotomy of these points of viewhas no clear resolution; it is the nature of a dog to bark, and it is thenature of an Initiate to seek the path of Adeptship. Such aspirantsm ust follow the path by means of disciplined motion, manifesting thefifth power of the Sphinx which is IRE, “to Go.” It is the Power thatcrowns the Four Virtues, which are the Four Powers of the Sphinx: toDare, to Know, to Will and to Keep Silent. The Fifth Power is referredto Spirit. When awakened, it enables us to consolidate the FourVirtues of the Adept and transform them from resistance topersistence, and fortify us for the journey. The emblem of this poweris the Egyptian Ankh, which as a word in the ancient Egyptianlanguage is (‘n) “life.”9"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" Ankh as sandle straps, from Gardiner’s article in TheEncyclopedia of Religion & Ethics, 1916Many years ago, the eminent Egyptologist Sir Alan Gardinerpresented the opinion that the hieroglyph of the Ankh represented asandal strap.10 Initially, it may seem strange that a word of suchsignificance as Ankh (“life”) would be signified graphicall y bysomething as mundane as part of a shoe. Yet, if we consider carefullythe philosophy of the Egyptians, we note that mo bility of the limbssignified life. Torpor and inactivity were the hallmarks of rigor mortisand death. The Egyptian book that we call The Book of the Deadactually bears the name (prt m hrw) “To go forth by day.”11It is not a book of the dead; it is a book that evokes eternal life. Andlife is movement—walking and going forth upon that eternal pathway.The sandal strap is a man-made object, formed by a cobbler, thatbinds to the sole of the shoe protecting the feet of Osiris as he goeson his journey. We read in Liber LXV, I, verse 11:Nor is it fitting for the cobbler to prate of the Royal matter.O cobbler! mend me this shoe, that I may walk.In ancient Egyptian, the sole of the foot was called (tbw).

This fact is significant enough to warrant our attention. Whyis it important to note that the god of cobblers was Ptah?In the Proclamation of the Perfected One, a magical incantationderived from spell 42 of The Egyptian Book of the Dead,13 Candidatesidentify each part of their body as divine.

It is I that GO that I may have LIFE.”Those who seek Initiation must remember that the task of the cobbleris to mend shoes—not “prate of the Royal matter.” The cobbler’s workis not very romantic, but it is absolutely necessary. We must makeour shoes ready for the journey. This means discovering and mendingthe weak spots in our lives, rather than daydreaming aboutattainments that are still “lone and far.” (The word “cobble” is derivedfrom t he Old French word coubler, which means, “to join together.” Itis connected to the Latin copulare, from whence we have our words“couple” and “copulate.” It is a word of Union.16) The PentagrammatonMortificatioIn the Aeon of the Child, the interpretation of the emblems of Death issignificantly different from that of the previous Aeons.

Death emblems in the Aeon of the Mother variedgreatly from those found in the succeeding Aeon of the Father. TheOsirian mythologies demonstrated a more developed and civilizedcomprehension of the psyche than those of the previous Aeon.Likewise, interpretation of death symbols in the Aeon of Horusdemonstrate a more evolved perception of the human condition. It isessential to understand this in order to comprehend the doctrines ofThelema.What we know of the expressions of the mortificatio motifs from theAeon of Isis are to be found only in those vestiges and accountswhich were preserved later during the Aeon of Osiris when the magicof writing developed, and from the artifacts of cultures that never fullyevolved from dominance by the Matriarch. 17 The evidencedemonstrates, for example, that in the Matriarchal age, humansacrifice was not an icon of redemption, but performed solely tosatisfy the blood-thirst of the Te rrible Mother Archetype18 in order tomaintain Her power over the world of consciousness. Archeologicalevidence unearthed at Çatalhöyük in Anatolia, dating back as recentlyas the late Neolithic Era approximately 8,000 years ago, shows aprimitive religion that embodied the entire cycle of life in a feminineSupreme Being. David Leeming and Jack Page describe her as,a being who nourished even as she took her offspringback to herself. Death and life, blood-letting andprocreation, light and dark—all the opposites of existence—were intricately entwined and united in the GreatMother as they had been since Paleolithic times.19During the Aeon of Isis, men had not yet realized that male seed wasnecessary for procreation. The Mot her was perceived as the giver ofall life and the taker of all life. The womb and the grave, both dark andall-encompassing, are thus archetypically connected.20 They are, inessence, one and the same. As the giver of life, the Great Mothersacrificed her own blood to mankind during childbirth. Subsequently,she exacted a bounty for t he privilege of that life born in blood—theblood of her own children, whenever she required it.After the fall of the Aeon of the Mother, fear of the resurgence ofprevious Ma triarchal dominants over the newly-founded Patriarchalepoch was recounted mythically in numerous texts.

It is alsopresent in the tomb of the 20th dynasty King Ramesses III, in ante-chambers to the sarc ophagus room that were especially designatedfor it.23The Book of the Heavenly Cow recounts the time when mankind hadgrown rebellious against the god Ra (R).

Of its threeModes, the Scorpion destroyeth himself, as if it were aType of Animal Pleasure. Next, the Serpent is proper toWorks of Change, or Magick; yet is he poisonous alsounless thou hast Wit to enchant him. Lastly, the Eagle issubtlest of this Sort, so that this Path is proper to aTranscendental Labour. Yet are all these in the Way ofDeath, so that thy Wand is dissolved and corroded in theWaters of the Cup, and must be renewed by Virtue of thyNature in Her Course.80The attribution of Scorpio to the Hebrew letter Nun, with itsassociated death symbolism, was likewise naturally associated withChristian Rosenkreutz and the emblems of the slain and resurrectedJesus Christ by the Brothers of the Rosy Cross. Notably, the value ofNun in full = 106 which tradition held to be the age of ChristianRosenkreutz at the time of his death.81In the original Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the InitiationRitual of the Adeptus Minor 5° = 6 was designed to follow theaccount of Christian Rosenkreutz and the legendary discovery of histomb, called “the vault of the Pastos” (i.e. “vault of the Shepherd.82 )The Chief Adept of the Order ritually represented Christia nRosenkreutz and occupied the sarcophagus which lay in the center ofthe Pastos. At the climax of the Ritual, he symbolically rose from thedead reciting the words of the New Testament, “I am the Resurrectionand the Life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shallhe live, and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.” 83Prior to entering the Vault of the Pastos, the Candidate for Initiationheard an Adept recite a phrase from the text of the Fama Fraternitatiswhich foreshadowed the symbolism to follow: “Ex Deo Nascimur; In"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"which foreshadowed the symbolism to follow: “Ex Deo Nascimur; InJesu Morimur; Per Spiritum Sanctum Reviviscimus.” The meaning ofthis phrase is, “From God we are born, in Jesus we die, we areresurrected by the Holy Spirit.” 84The overt Christian symbolism of this Ritual, although beautifullycomposed, has rendered it obsolete in the New Aeon. Much of this isdiscussed in detail in my Initiation in the Aeon of the Child, chapter 7,“Myself Made Perfect.” The aspirant in the New Aeon sings a newsong, looking toward the West () wherein is Amente , the place ofdeath, he prays for Light upon the ways of his Ka, by which We meanThe Holy Guardian Angel.

The motif appears asArchetypal images in religious symbolism as well as in Fairy Tales. Inthe world of the Archetypes, it may appear interpreted with either apositive tenor or with one that is negative. This elasticity occursbecause the primordia l images stand outside the boundaries ofconsciousness and are not subject to the rules of manifestationintrinsic in the dualistic world. Almost without exception, in oursecular world, the characterization of “upside-downness” takes on anegative connotation. For example, if the total amount of a home loanexceeds the value of the home, the owner of that home is said to be“upside down” in that loan. We understand immediately what thatmeans.

In that sense, its value, according to Crowley, is that of theCenotaph.The word Cenotaph derives from the Greek κενoτάιoν, “emptytomb.” The word is first attested in Xenophon’s Anabasis (circa 370BCE). Xenophon wrote about entombing soldiers fallen in battle, andof some soldiers whose bodies were missing, Others they coul d not find, and for these they erected agreat cenotaph and covered it with wreaths.37The most significant point that Crowley made is that if, at some pointin the future, the doctrine of Thelema should fail and the world beplunged into a period of Dark Ages, the formula represented by theCenotaph of the Hanged Man would be the way to follow in order toset things aright again.Crowley’s use of the word Cenotaph is of particular interest.

While he merely hinted at this inThe Book of Thoth, it nevertheless points to it quite directly:“Redemption is a bad word; it implies a debt.”38Cenotaph means “empty tomb,” and within dogmatic Christianity, theDoctrine of the Empty Tomb has become a central article of faith inthe bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

The upper pool was called “the pool of Siloah” , while thelower pool was called “the pool of Shelah” . The former wordproperly signifies the equivalent of ‘sent’ (πεσταλμένoς), while thelatter does not. 47 The author of the gospel was making a subtleparallel between the blind man being “sent” to be healed by Jesus,the one “sent by God,” that is, the Messiah, whom they believed to bethe healer of the entire world.Crowley gave a brief description of the higher aspect of this Trance inLiber Aleph, Cha pter 18, De Somno Lucido (On the Sleep of Light):For to him whose physical Needs (of whatsoever kind) arenot truly satisfied cometh a physical or lunar Sleepappointed to refresh and recreate by Cleansing andRepose; but on him that is bodily pure the Lord bestowetha solar or lucid Sleep, wherein move Images of pure Lightfashioned by the True Will.

He called this tranceThe Sleep of Sialam.49 In one place he referred to it curiously as “thesacred slumber of Sialam Boaghiee,” which he said “can be enjoyedonce in a hundred years, and then only by persons who are singularlyconstituted ...”50While Randolph’s true sources of knowledge remain s a mystery,there is little doubt that his Sleep of Sialam and the Sleep of Siloam"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"there is little doubt that his Sleep of Sialam and the Sleep of Siloamare synonymous, certainly in the Lunar form, and probably in theSolar form as well, based on his description of Sialam Boaghiee.Madame Blavatsky first mentioned this trance in Isis Unveiled,published in 1877, veiling its true name by calling it “the sacredslumber of ***”51 Later, in The Secret Doctrine, published in 1888, sheopenly used the term “Sleep of Siloam.”52 Writing for students of thattime—who were captivated by the mystical allure of ancient Egypt—she was not content to merely state that the rite was practiced incurrent times in Asia Minor and Syria, which was probably true. Butshe then lapsed into a preposterous description of its practice in theKing’s Chamber of the Pyramid of Cheo ps, which was based onnothing more than sheer fantasy. Aspirants to AA should not assume that the Sleep of Siloam refersonly to the use of trance-inducing magical mirrors (as described byRandol ph), or somnambulistic drugs (as suggested by Blavatsky), orsexual magick. The highest form of the Sleep of Siloam, the Solarform, is described briefly in Liber LXV, Chapter IV (the Chapter of ): In the garden of immortal kisses, O thou brilliant One,shine forth! Make Thy mouth an opium-poppy, that onekiss is the key to the infinite sleep and lucid, the sleep ofShi-loh-am. In my sleep I beheld the Universe like a clearcrystal without one speck.53The experience of the Sleep of Siloam in its ethereal and most loftyform is a gift of The Holy Guardian Angel.

As strange as this must seem, pr ior to thedevelopment of the individual ego, man lived without self-consciousness in a world of wholeness. The collective was the onlyperception of which early humans were aware. Edward Edingerstated, The psychological significance of the discovery ofopposites can hardly be overestimated.

Theshaft was originally fitted to a wooden handle. Any Pesesh-Kef madeof flint is very old, and is rarely found after the First Dynasty. Theoriginal use of this flint knife was as a tool of the midwife in thebirthchamber. The midwife used it to cut the umbilical cord of anewborn infant, hence the significance of the Pesesh Kef as a dividerof the united, separating a new-born child from its mother.6 Thedescription of the blade as having the shape of a “fish tail” is asignificant indicator that links this primitive instrument to the veryearly stages of the Matriarchial Aeon.

Papyrus of Ani (18th dynasty)from The Egyptian Book of the Dead: The Book of GoingForth by DayLikewise, in The Hall of Two Truths, near the Scales whereon theheart of man was weighed against this feather of Maat, we can see awitness to the ceremony whose name is seldom mentioned.

Conversely, the Egyptian mind,like that of the Taoist, considered truth as a state or condition to berealized only with the absence of all that was not true.In that Hall of Two Truths, the heart of an individual was weighedagainst the feather of Maat to judge the character of the soul. In orderto bypass the devourer of souls, the heart was required to balanceagainst the ostrich feather. Note this well: it was required to be void offalsehood, not filled with truth. The righ teous person proclaimed, My wrongdoing has been removed. The evil that adhered to me hasbeen driven away!18Throughout the vocabulary of the ancient Egyptian language, thehieroglyph of the ostrich feather—used as an ideogram—wasidentified consistently with the goddess of Truth. As a phonogram (šw), it was used extensively in words denoting emptiness, absence,nothingness and desolation.

Thus, it is said that below the Abyss,Reason is Lord.26 For Initiates, it is vital to realize that the equity weestablish for the sake of an organized life is a relative and fragilebalance. Likewise, it is incredibly elastic and often randomly definedby the societies in which we live—whether by religious beliefs, socialmores, or just plain prejudice. We bandy about words such as “truth”and “justice” as if they were universal absolutes, all the while beingquite willing to expand the boundaries of our own definitionswhenever it suits our ne eds.This is not just applicable to the grand stage of world governments,but to our family lives as well. If you teach your children to “alwaystell the truth,” you had better be prepared for an object lesson in bluntresponses when you least expect it. Our children quickly learn thatdespite all the adult talk of “truth,” the real world in which they learn tolive is duplicitous and capricious. It doesn’t take long for them todiscover that the adult world can randomly make a distinctionbetween a “white lie,” and what my own mother called “an out-and-out lie.” The challenge is to teach the difference between tact and alie. It has been my experience that a great many people do notunderstand the difference, and will justify falsehood under the guiseof tact. Why is this so? Simply because our “falsehood is but a little falser”than our truth—in the words of The Vision and the Voice. If weunderstand this i n the sense in which it was meant, this does not givelicense to cheat, lie, and steal. It doesn’t give us the freedom toexcuse ourselves from the common decency of telling the truth as weknow it, and trying our best to live an upright life. It is, on the otherhand, advising us not to confound our limited conception of “truth”with “Truth.” Truth is above the world of reason and the domain oflinear thinking.

InInitiation in the Aeon of the Child, I explained that the formula ofL.V.X. was not abrogate but superseded.35 This is only to beexpected. It would be a contradiction to consider the five-letteredname , “Jesus,” to remain as a glyph for the attainment ofThelemites, when Jesus is one of the “gods of men” cursed in thethird chapter of The Book of the Law.The view of redemption held by the ministers of the old Aeon signifiedthe coronation of the four elements in the City of the Sun.36 Ourdefinition of redemption is the transfiguration of the Virgin to Mother,and her subsequent C oronation in the City of Night, the HolyMountain Zion, the City of the Pyramids.Still, the Pentagram remains the figure of Man, and the transformationof mankind the ultimate aim of Initiation. Also, the five-pointed star isa symbol sanctified in the first chapter of The Book of the Law, withthe addition of a red circle in the middle, a symbol sacred to Nu.37This being so, we should expect the existence of a formula expressedas a type of Pentagrammaton superseding the L.V.X. formula of theold Aeon and demonstrating that of N.O.X..

Crowley taught that thecorrect way to do this was to discover and comprehend thecharacteristics of al l such forces and then establishing right relationsto all things within the limits of one’s comprehension of the Universe.Toward this end, our unswerving guide will always be The Book ofthe Law where the correct mode of conduct for Thelemites is clearlydelineated. While we acknowledge that we are temporarily boundunto the Wheel of Necessity (the wheel of Sasāra), we reject theattitude of fatality that scorns the intellect and the passions as vicesof the unholy.We cannot reject the rule of the intellect, despite its limitations,because to do so leads inevitably to mental disorder even as itperpetuates ignorance. Neither do we consider our passions asexhibitions of animal nature, for to do so denies the experience of joyin the flesh. Still, we must not surrender to animalistic debauchery,but refine the rapture of these experiences: to exceed in love withdelicacy, know joy of all the senses with subtletyrather than withgross appetites; to seek to understand how to live by the eight andninety rules of art.

(Michelspacher, Cabala 1616)The Guas RevolveIn Sanskrit, the word Gua means literally, “thread,” signifying asingle strand of a more complex, intertwined cord. 1 We interpret theGuas as modes of action, or tendencies, rather than actual qualities.These three together are the threads of tendencies for thephenomenal universe.2Sattva means “lucidity,” and represents clarity, fluidity, andequability. Rajas means “activity,” and signifies excitability andenergy. Tamas means “obscurity” and is inaction, sluggishness,and torpor. Crowley described the Guas as apparatus ofcommunication between the planes of existence, and thereforeconventions only.3 In other words, they have no substance inthemselves. They are the means whereby we can perceive theinclination or innate structure of things. Being threefold, weimmediately recognize the Guas as an Archetype of the DivineRealm.The number Three is a number aligned with Divinity, not as aconscious asso ciation, but an expression of unconscious reality. Forexample, in Christianity, the Godhead is represented by the trinity ofGod the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. In Hinduism, it isevident in the Trimurti , the Hindu triad: Brahmā , theCreator; Viu , the Preserver; and Śiva , the Destroyer. Inthe Hebrew Qabalah, there is what we call the divine triad: Kether, the Crown, the Scintilla of Godhead; Chokmah , Wisdom,the All-Father; Binah , Understanding, the Great Mother. We see itin the triad of Rome: Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva. We see it in theancient divine triad of Gaul: Teutatis, Esus, and Taranis. In Egyptianreligion there was the dominant triad of Osiris, Isis, and Horus. InAlchemy, there are the Three Realms of the manifest world: Animal,Vegetable, and Mineral.These are just a few examples of divine triads. We do not rationallyunderstand why it seems necessary that the Unconscious identifyThree with the divine nature. But we see it, we feel it, and weexperience it that way. The number Four is the number associatedautomatically with Consciousness. We live in the world of Four, not"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"automatically with Consciousness. We live in the world of Four, notThree. Despite the fact that we can only visualize three dimensions,we automatically seek to find the Fourth component when weexperi ence motifs from the Unconscious.The Unconscious seeks to see the Cross, the Quaternary, theSquare. According to Carl Jung, in the spontaneous symbolism of theUnconscious, the Cross as Quaternary indicates the transpersonalArchetype of the Self, a symbol of man’s wholeness. Plutarchreminded us that the Pythagoreans swore their most sacred Oath bythe God who delivered to them the Quaternary. Then he added that itis from the number Four that the soul of man is composed.4Because the Guas are Three they partake inherently of theUnconscious nature, all the while acting on Consciousness. TheBhagavad Gītā describes them as tending to bind or imprison theSpirit within the body5; attachment to the inherent tendencies of theGu as binds one to mortality, preventing one from experiencingdissolution in the infinite. The Sattva Gua binds one to the body byattachment to bliss and wisdom; the Rajas Gua binds one tomortality by attachment to action; the Tamas Gua binds one byattachment to ignorance and heedlessness.We can get a general comprehension of the Guas by consideringthree basic phases of our daily life: Rising from bed in the morning isan expression of Rajas, our first activity of the day. Tamas maystruggle against Rajas at this point, for we mayfeel the urge to lieback down for a bit more sleep. Our better sense prevails, and weclear our heads (Sattva) and set out upon our prescribed tasks.Throughout the day, we will alternate back and forth betweenactivities (Rajas), contemplation and reasoning (Sattva), andweariness and fatigue (Tamas). When we sleep eight hours, Tamas isdominating one third of our life.

Yet, the sure consciousness of ecstasy (Sattva)remains, not as faith, but a certainty. The aspirant prays unto the Lordfor aid in experiencing (Rajas) the bliss of union with the BelovedOne.The Guas are said to be in constant motion, with each Gua strivingagainst the other for dominance. The nature of Sattva works againstRajas and Tamas; Rajas works against Sattva and Tamas; Tamasworks to overcome Sattva and Rajas. If Sattva (lucidity) prevails,Rajas and Tamas (activity and sluggishness) are subdued in theaspirant.7 If Rajas prevails, Sattva and Tamas are diminished, and soon. This threefold arrangement do es not presuppose a condition ofbalance. This is not a case of the third equilibrating two others. TheGuas do not balance one another, but rather continually battle fordominance, thereby constituting an unending revolution of influence.This alternating tendency for dominant presence turns the GreatWheel of Sasāra , the wheel of “continuous motion.” This is theWheel of repeating birth, life, death, and rebirth.

In The Book of Thoth,Crowley stated that “One of the most important aphorisms of Hinduphilosophy is: ‘The Gunas revolve’.” This aphorism has its origin inthe 14th chapter of the Bhagavad Gītā where we are likewiseinformed how one may break free of this Wheel of Necessity:He who, seated as a neutral, is unshaken by the Gunas;who saying, “The Gunas rev olve;” standeth apart,immovable.Balanced in pleasure and pain, self-reliant, to whom alump of earth, a rock and gold are alike; the same to lovedand unloved, firm, the same in censure and in praise.The same in honour and ignominy, the same to friend andfoe, abandoning all undertakings—he is said to havecrossed over the Gunas.

For I amthe abode of Brahman, and of the indestructible nectar ofimmortality, of immemorial Dharma,10 and of unendingbliss.11In the Thoth Tarot deck, the three Guas are again depicted on theThree of Discs. Cro wley describes this card as demonstrating theinfluence of Binah in the sphere of Earth, determining its mos t basicform. This divine structuring of form is illustrated by the three wheelsof the Guas forming the base of a pyramid. The title of the card is“Works.” Aspirants should note that the title is plural, referring to thethree-fold Guas. The structuring of this Pyramid is achieved by theright relation of the Guas in all aspects of our life. In the daily life andpr actices of the Adept, such proper recognition and comprehensionof these three tendencies is essential for the attainment of Mastery,eventually to be able to “stand apart, immovable.”"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Atu X, Fortune, Thoth Tarot"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Three of Discs, Thoth TarotFollow thy Fortune, careless where it leadthee!The axle moveth not: attain thou that!12In order for the Adeptus Major 6°=5 of the AA to attain to the nextGrade of Adeptus Exemptus 7°=4, he or she must accomplish ThreeGreat Tasks, the second of which according to One Star In Sight isthe Comprehension and use of the Revolution of the Wheel of Forceunder its three successive forms of Radiation, Conduction, andConvection (Mercury, Sulphur, Salt; or Sattva, Rajas, Tamas), withtheir corresponding natures on other planes.13 The method ofdeliverance from the chains of mortality and karma is, as describedby the Bhagavad Gītā, that of indifference and working without lust ofresult.

Thou hast love; tear thy mother from thine heart, andspit in the face of thy father. Let thy foot trample the bellyof thy wife, and let the babe at her breast be the prey ofdogs and vultures.14The seemingly harsh language of these verses is mitigated when onerealizes that literal interpretation is without merit. However, the Adeptwho eventually comes to work without attachment to the vicissitudesof life driven by the Guas may be perceived by friends and family tobe completely self-centered and emotionally vacant. Although this israrely the case in truth, any wife, hus band, or life-partner of anInitiate pursuing the Great Work must realize that the Initiate’sdevotion to such Work is not just a pleasant pastime. At times, theWork will require the attention of the aspirant to such a degree thatthe personal life may suffer. A married Adept who eventually takes upthe Task of the Babe of the Abyss needs to be aware that a portion ofthe great burden of his or her Task will be borne by loved ones, andthe weight of that burden may crush the foundations of theirrelationship. This is all the more reason that we encourageThelemites to marry fellow Thelemites who understand and sharethat thirst for the Infinite.ThreadsDespite a noted preference for Sattva, Hindu religion considers all theGu as to be imperfect because they are not the Absolute orBrahman 15 Such an attitude is correct from the point of view ofthe Supernals. But below the Abyss, such an ascetic attitude canreadily degenerate into a bloodless and rigid dogma that finds onlysin and corruption even in the innocent joys of worldly life.16"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"sin and corruption even in the innocent joys of worldly life.16Christianity is a fine example of the latter, teaching that one shouldhate the world and all its ways:Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not inhim.17The concept of the “thread of life” is also found in Greek mythology,like wise expressed in the motif of a triad. It is found in the account ofthe three Fates: Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos.18 In Hesiod’sTheogony, they are first introduced as the daughters of Nυξ (Night),but later in the same work he assigns their parentage to Zeus andThemis.19The Three Fates, Giorgio Ghisi after Giulio Romano(1558)They are depicted weaving the thread of life together.

Within Greek mythology it was assumed theFates had ordered the life of mankind and there was no deviationfrom the threads they had spun. The term of one’s life wasdetermined by Lachesis who measured its length; Clotho turned thewheel of life’s thread, which was cut at a time determined by Atropos.Plato, in his Republic,20 identified these three as daughters of Ananke,“necessity.”21 For Plato, as all the ancient Greeks, that which wasordained by the Fates was unavoidable. In their opinion, even thegods could not escape the determination of the Fates.Thelemites do not view Atu X, The Wheel, as a representation of fixedFate, nor is the idea compatible with our doctrine. Today, we will oftenhear someone say, “Everything happens for a reason.” Following anuntimely death they will utter, “When your time is up, it’s up.” This isutter rubbish, and Thelemites must reject this nonsense as thefatalistic jabber of Choronzon.Everything does not happen for a reason. Crowley wrote, “It is PureChance that rules the Universe; therefore, and only therefore, life isgood.” 22 Students would be well-advised to school themselves in thehistorical argument of chance versus predestination, for examplereading Schopenhauer’s On the Freedom of Will, where hedistinguished between chance and necessity. Compare this toLuther’s argument in his work On the Bo ndage of the Will, thateverything is a necessity because the Creator already knows whatwill occur.23 The absurdity of this latter view is typical of spiritualdeterminism and confirms Luther as an advocate of the idea that willone day define Go d himself as the perfect personification of one ofLaplace’s demons.24Pierre-Simon Laplace, in his A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities(1814) argued for scientific determinism, stating that if one knew theprecise location and momentu m of every atom in the universe, theirpast or future values could be calculated by the laws of mechanics:We ought to regard the present state of the universe asthe effect of its anterior state and as the cause of the onewhich is to follow.

We now know that the argument of Laplace isnot compatible with quantum mechanics nor with the HeisenbergUncertainty Principle. From our point of view, there is a factor infiniteand unknown, which is ultimately the monkey wrench in themachinery of determinism and fatalism.Circulatio In Alchemy, one of the most important operations was Circulatio,which was a process of continuous distillation and condensation thatcaus ed the primary matter to evolve to a higher state. In his Lexiconof Alchemy Martinus Ruland defined Circulation as,the exaltation by the agency of Heat of a Pure Liquidthough a circular solution and coagulation in the Pelican.It is only for those liquid substances which are to beresolved or attenuated into air, and can thence in returnbe brought b ack into a liquid state; it most frequentlyfollows those extractions by which essences are made.26As Ruland indicated, the circulatory distillation utilized a device knownas the Vas Pellicanicum, or the “Pelican.” Slow distillation within thevessel allowed the vapors to rise and, upon cooling, fall back downinto the original materia l to be distilled once again. This process isrepeated numerous times."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Dove of the Holy Spirit brings the circular Work to an end.(Fludd, Utriusque Cosmi, 1617) The Vas Pellicanicum, (Solis e puteo emergentis: sivedissertationis chymia-technicae libri tres, 1613) With each circle of distillation, impurities are removed from theoriginal material until a more rarified essence is obtained and thepoint of exaltation is reached.This alchemical process has a direct analogy to the practices"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"This alchemical process has a direct analogy to the practicesperformed by aspirants to the Great Order. Psychologically, EdwardEdinger describes circulatio as,the repeated circuit of all aspects of one’s being, whichgradually generates awareness of a transpersonal centeruniting the conflicting factors. There is a transit throughthe opposites, which are experienced alternately againand again, leading finally to their reconciliation.27The practicing Magician performs this same type of circulationthrough all the aspects of the psyche. Again and again, the weakspot s in the armor are confronted; the Purifications, Banishings, andConsecrations are repeatedly performed. In this three-fold process,we cleanse and clarify, and rededicate ourselves to the Great Work.This must be done continually, untilit is an integral part of the dailyroutine. After Banishing, we begin the Purifications by taking up theScourge, the Weapon of Sulphur, which is applied against theNephesh to awaken us from our torpor, laziness, and inertia. Weplace the Chain of Salt about our neck in the position of Daath tobind fast our wandering thoughts and bring us once again to one-pointedness. The Dagger of Mercury symbolically slays that whichmust be slain upon the Altar of the Most High.28 Then we Consecrateby anointing ourselves with the Holy Oil of Abramelin, dedicating ourlife to the performance of the Great Work. Like the AlchemicalCirculatio of repeated distillation, the fixed is made volatile and risesin a more rarified state, regaining fixation once more and becomingrealized within us, where the cycle is continued again.

Crowley succinctly wrote,“Obedience and faith to Him that liveth and triumpheth,that reigneth above you in your palaces as the Balance ofRighteousness and Truth” is your duty to your HolyGuardian Angel, and the duty of the demon world to you.30"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"These Four Great Princes are Lucifer, Leviathan, Satan and Belial.31Yet must he that understandeth go forth unto theoutermost Abyss, and there must he speak with him thatis set above the four-fold terror, the Princes of Evil, evenwith Choronzon, the might y devil that inhabiteth theoutermost Abyss. And none may speak with him, orunderstand him, but the servants of Babylon, thatunderstand, and they that are without understanding, hisservants.32Do not be misled on this point, for these references are not to betaken literally. The meaning of these Princes is given in The Visionand the Voice in the Third Aethyr:And Satan is worshipped by men under the name ofJesus; and Lucifer is worshipped by men under the nameof Brahma; and Leviathan is worshipped by men underthe name of Allah; and Belial is worshipped by men underthe name of Buddha.In other words, they are the four great religions of the world:Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and Buddhism.

During that experience, aspiring Neophytes are protectedby Officers of the Order and the purity of the AA. Magically, thisexperience prepares Candidates for the more stringent requirementof direct confrontation and conquest required of the Adept.Let us more closely examine two of these four Princes.Liber Trigrammaton, in Trigram number 13, reveals to us a clearimage of one of the Great Princes of Evil.33 For most practitioners inthe West, this particular Prince of Evil is paramount, for he isworshipped predominately over all others.34 Beginning with Trigramnumber 11, we read,"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Also certain secret ones concealed the Light of Purity inthemselves, protecting it from the Persecutions.Likewise also did certain sons and daughters of Hermesand of Aphrodite, more openly.

They pretended toconceal that Light, that they might betray it , and profaneit.In the verse corresponding to , the word “Enemy” written with anupper case letter in mid-sentence draws our immediate attention.This is not “an” enemy in some generic sense; this is the Enemy.Crowley, as we know, was well-versed in the Bible, and wouldcertainly have found this to be a fami liar euphemism.In the New Testament, the parable of the sower in Matthew Chapter13 tells of a man who slept while his enemy sowed tares among thewheat.35 When Jesus explained this parable he said, “The enemy whosowed them is the devil...”36Later in the Gospel of Luke this terminology is used more specifically:I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. Behold, Igive unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpionsand over all the power of the enemy.37 In traditional Christian language, the “Enemy” is synonymous withSatan, the adversary. Who then, in the Thelemic language of LiberTrigrammaton, is this Enemy, this adversary?The Twentieth Aethyr of The Vision and the Voice gives a vividaccount of the Tenth Atu, The Wheel, described in a manner thatdiffers considerably from traditional representations, and quite unlikethat found even in the Thoth Tarot.

And hechose the wolf for the lust of the flesh, and the raven forthe lust of the mind; but me did he choose above all tosimulate the pure prompting of the soul.

The Enemy,according to Liber Trigrammaton, “confused them,” that is, “certainsecret ones” ( ) who truly concealed the light of purity inthemselves, and “certain sons and daughters of Hermes andAphrodite” (), those whose quest for God is through Knowledge(γνσις) or Love (γαπη).

Yang in the line of Earth (the bottomline) cannot be balanced by Yin in Heaven (the uppermost line) whenTao is in the position of Man. The result is false understanding, whichis called Understanding (Yin in Heaven); false compassion, that iscalled Compassion (Yang in Earth); and selfishness, which is calledSelflessness (Tao in Man). This is another Trigram of those who haveshut their blood up in their heart, and who make war upon the HolyOne, while sending forth their delusion among men.42 There is no ambiguit y here about the activity of the Enemy. Theconfusion brought to the world was deliberate and calculated. It iscalled The Great Sorcery. The followers of the Enemy did not claim tobe merely guardians of the Mystery of Truth, they professed to be thesole depository of Truth. The E nemy confounded the world bysaying, “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto theFather but by me.”43 Subsequently, his disciples would be no lesspretentious.In 185–189, Irenaeus the Bishop of Lyons would write:Since therefore we have such proofs, it is not necessaryto seek the truth among others which it is easy to obtainfrom the Church; since the apostles, like a rich man[depositing his money] in a bank, lodged in his handsmost copiously all things pertaining to the truth: so thatevery man, whosoever will, can draw from her the waterof life. For she is the entrance to life; all others are thievesand robbers...44In the earliest days of Christianity there were those who opposed thisclaim.

The Vision and the Voicehas separated the dominant ones into four basic groups,corresponding to the Four Great Princes of Evil of the world. For mostaspirants, at least one of these Great Princes to be confronted willcause great discomfort. For those whose ear ly life includedindoctrination into Christianity the ordeal will be that of confrontingSatan and all his wiles. If Buddhist, then the ordeal will be that ofBelial; if Islam, then Leviathan will be the adversary; as Lucifer is tothe Hindu literalists.Those whose childhood did not include training or service in any ofthese religions are not exempt from this ordeal. The influence of all ofthem upon the societies where they are the dominant religion is oftensubtle, but present to a high degree. In the United States, theinfluence of Christianity upon all aspects of daily life is as pervasiveas it is pernicious and hypocritical. 47 The same is true around theworld with all the religions discussed. The sly and subtle influences ofthese groups must be confronted and rooted out of the psyche.Thelemites must stop allowing themselves to be shackled by thosewho pretend to conceal the Light of Truth even while they profane it.While modern Christianity is guilty of many repressions againsthumanity, it pales against the a trocities being carried out today byRadical Islam and its mi nions.

Yet, there is a sinister thread that binds them to the curseagainst their religion. In many countries ruled by Islamic law, any perceived insult againstIslam, the Quran, or the Prophet Mohammed is punishable by death.Recently, in Pakistan, a twelve-year-old Christian girl with Downsyndrome was accused by neighbors of burning pages from theQuran as she ignited paper for cooking fuel. The child was arrestedand thrown into jail while her fanatic Muslim neighbors screamed forher to be stoned to death. Another was quoted as saying the little girlshould be burned to death to “teach her a lesson.” In 2005, theDanish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published twelve editorialcartoons which depicted the p rophet Mohammed.

(Prayer).These words are spelled as follows:T.A.R.O. = T.O.R.A. = 57T.R.O.A. = A.T.O.R. = O.R.A.T = Each of these = 671 = 61 x 11, the number of Zero or Nothing (AIN =) multiplied by the great magical number 11 that unites Microcosmand Macrocosm. Furthermore, 671 is the value of (Adonai)spelled in full: = 20 + 106 + 434 + 111 = 671.The great significance of the number 671 is that it demonstrates thatAdonai, The Holy Guardian Angel, is identical with the Way; thatPrayer leads to the Gate of Init iation and the Door thereof; Taro is theKey to that Door; and that the Law itself is Nothing other than this.Crowley has said that this is the reason the Outer College of the AA is crowned by the Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel. 58 This great number 671 is a lso the number of theInitiation Ritual of the Neophyte of the AA.Considering the Wheel of Tarot as a Great Key leads us to note thatthe total number of cards in the Tarot are 78 whichis also the value ofMezla, the influence from Kether the Crown.59 This observation isreinforced by the fact that 78 = Σ(1-12), and 12 is the value of ,“He,” an epithet for The Ancient One attributed to Kether, but a name"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"“He,” an epithet for The Ancient One attributed to Kether, but a namewhich indicates all Three Supernal Sephiroth: the Mother Binah, the Father Chokmah, and the Crown of Kether.

Qabalistically, they are the solehuman inhabitants of the Garden of Eden, which is the Supernal Triadabove the Abyss, beyond the realm of consciousness and materiality.In a state of perfect innocenc e, which is to say ignorance, theyinhabit the realm of Paradise.According to the well-known story, the Serpent then appears to thenewly created Eve:Now the serpe nt was more subtil than any beast of thefield which the Lord God had made.

Whenthey saw that their creators had the form of beasts, theyloathed them. They were very knowledgable.9Prior to this passage in The Origin of the World, the text informed usthat “The interpretation of ‘The Beast’ is ‘The Instructor,’ “for it wa sfound to be the wisest of all beings.”10 To t he Gnostic writer of On theOrigin of the World, the Serpent was not “subtle” ( )11 asdescribed by the text of Genesis, but “wise” (). The same Copticword is used as a noun to mean “instructor.”12It does seem curious that the acquisition of knowledge should bealigned with evil and guilt. Yet, we know that traditionally, certainlyduring the Aeon of Osiris, this was the subtle attitude. For example,St. Paul wrote to the Corinthians that “knowledge puffeth up.”13 Fromthe psychological viewpoint, Carl Jung taught that increasedknowledge can indeed create inflation, regardless of what type ofknowledge it is. There is the danger that consciousness, when seizingupon new information, can seduce the weak-minded into believingthat they have just solved the universal riddle. This is no more thanwhat we generally call being conceited. In particular, by accessing thedeeper strata of consciousness the personality is naturally expanded,and it is not uncommon that this can lead to inexorable inflation.Archetypically, we should realize that in ancient times knowledgeitself was the domain of the gods. Hence, in Genesis’ account ofAdam, the acquisitio n of greater knowledge was anathematized as adeadly sin. Jung described it thusly:I think that Genesis is right in so far as eve ry steptowards greater consciousness is a kind of Prometheanguilt: through knowledge, the gods are as it were robbedof their fire; that is, something that was the property ofthe unconscious powers is torn out of its natural contextand subordinated to the whims of the conscious mind.14Such individuals can experience a transformation of consciousness"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Such individuals can experience a transformation of consciousnesswhich literally sets them apart from the host of humanity, havingexperienced something that was previously of the realm of the gods.As Genesis says, “ye shall be as gods.” Such an event isnevertheless an isolating experience, for such a one can never returnto the blissful ignorance of the mundane world.15 Aspirants of allstripes may experience this to some degree, which is why wedifferentiate between the “initiated” and the “profane”—even asegotistically self-satisfied as that may sound to profane ears.However, there is a danger here for those who seek Initiation thatcannot be ignored. This is particularly true of those who accept theLaw of Thelema. Precisely because Thelema is dedicated to theproposition that each man and woman is a unique Star in the body ofheaven, and that “there is no God but Man,” for some individuals,even the most basic introduction to this doctrine can result in anextremely overly-inflated ego, leaving them completely blind to theactual poverty of their psychic condition.One young, self-proclaimed aspirant to Thelema once declared to methat there was no such thing as an “authority” on Thelema. Heclaimed that he had no need to resort to an authority in any way,since he already knew everything at some level of his consciousness.This individual certainly had the knowledge of how to remain jobless,homeless and how to survive by begging spare change on the street.He was, however, incapable of seeing the emptiness of his inflatedview contrasted with his actual condition. A beggar cannot hide his poverty behind a veil of brash language. There is also the commonpalaver among sup erficial aspirants proclaiming that those who areacknowledged as Authorities are merely egotists. They do notunderstand that such disdain for external Authority is fueled by therebellion of their own egos, which desire supremacy above all. Thesincere aspirant knows instinctive ly that in order to learn one mustlisten; in order to lead, one must first follow. In Crowley’s day, anystudent who dared to ridicule the Authority of the AA would havecome to know the judgment of The Beast 666—which would havebeen a swift boot in the rear end and a hearty invitation to hit the roadand join the rest of the Qliphoth.

The rigorous"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"immediate technical guidance by a trained Instructor.

While Hierophantic methods varyfrom Instructor to Instructor, strictness and diligence on this point areconsistent. My own illustrious Instructor employed the method ofregular reminders that I was little more than the syphilitic son of acamel driver, with apologies to Gimel. I found it quite humbling.It could certainly have been worse. Probationers who entered theWisdom School of Pythagoras received a much more rigorousmethod of preparatory training. They were initially given the title of“hearers” (κoυσματικóι),16 and required to submit to five years ofabsolute silence, which he called a quinquennial silence (πενταετςσoωπή).17 Pythagoras believed that conquering the tongue was themost difficult of victories.18 Apuleius said that Pythagoras initiallytaught his disciples nothing except to be silent. In the words ofApuleius, This was I say, absolutely the first rudiment of wisdom, tolearn to think, and to unlearn to prate.19In the Enchiridion of the Greek philosopher Empictetus with acommentary by Simplicius, we read that the reason for such a silenceamong the Pythagoreans was so that the soul might be turned awayfrom exte rnal things and from the irrational passions.20 In otherwords, it served as a preventative to inflation.Initiates of AA are t aught to never forget the limitations andimperfections of incarnation, no matter how exalted the attainmentone is granted. We are reminded of this in a selection from Liber LXV:O my Lord, let us sail upon the sea of blood!There is a deep taint beneath the ineffable bliss; it is thetaint of generation. Yea, though the flower wave bright inthe sunshine, the root is deep in the darkness of earth.21Genuine spiritual humility is gained by devotion to the Great Work,exalting that Work over self, and striving ever toward the BelovedOne, the Holy Guardian Angel.

The essence of their messageinvariably is, “Why are you listening to others, when you could listento me?”The response from the leadership of O.T.O. and AA has been, andwill continue to be Silence.22 Those who seek genuine attainment forthe benefit of all they serve, take to heart these words from Liber VII:We attained to be starry grains of gold dust in the sandsof a slow river.23We aspire to be a grain of dust; not an obelisk or toweringmonument. Whosoever hath ears to hear, let him hear.The Knowledge of Life and DeathDespite our ever-continuing efforts to guard against inflation and keepthe human ego in check, the Aeon of Horus has led us to a new truththat rejects the notion that individual knowledge is to be assoc iatedwith sin and guilt. Knowledge is no longer the proprietary domain ofthe gods for it has been inexorably identified with the dust of theAbyss, and therefore, intrinsically faulty.24 In the Aeon of Osiris, during which the basic knowledge of mankindspanned the development of writing to a pe riod of unprecedentedindustrial prowess, the “forbidden fruit” was the knowledge of goodand evil—which we have determined was originally contained in the“great round” of the womb of the Mother during the Aeon of Isis, andwhich was wrested from her grasp by the newly born Aeon of Osiris.In the development of our perception of the world of opposites duringthe Aeon of the Father, the realization of the dichotomy of thegood/evil axis was one of the most powerful obtained. For the abilityto exercise conscious judgment gave man choice and discernment,where during the preceding Age of Isis, there was only fate and blindfear of the gods.25 We know that among primitives, as well as ininfants, there is no conscious distinction between inner and outerreality. The individual psyche is identified with the Archetypal psyche,and in turn, with the external world.26 There is no clear delineation"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"and in turn, with the external world.26 There is no clear delineationbetween inside and outside, individual or collective. Thus, for theprimitive psyche, consciousness is identified as a condition ofwholeness—being one with Nature and the gods, the Garden ofParadise, the all-encompassing Round, and the womb of the mother.A good example of this ancient psychic perception is found in Plato’saccount of the origin of man: ... the primeval man was round and had four hands andfour feet, back and sides forming a circle...Terrible was their might and strength, and the thou ghts oftheir hearts was great, and they made an attack upon thegods.27The development of the human ego represented a breach of thisprimal perception of consciousness. The individual ego evolved toserve as the seat of the subjective, individual identity, unique andapart from the all-encompassing womb of the Mother. With thisdevelopment, man became the primary arbitrator of good and evil inhis world.The Instructor or Initiator now comes to humankind in the Aeon of theChild with a new revelation for humankind. The new forbidden fruit isno longer the knowledge of good and evil. It is the Knowledge ofLife and Death.Mysterium est Mortis et VitæOne might argue that the perception of Life and Death was clearlyapparent to our forebears from previous Aeons, and that knowledgeof these opposites is not a new revelation.

As noted previously, in themyth of the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve had b een threatenedwith death should they disobey the commandment of God and touchthe tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

Let allthe gods and the archangels and the angels and thespirits that are on the earth, and above the earth, andbelow the earth, that are in all the heavens and in all thehells, let them be as m otes dancing in the beam of mineeye!I am he that swalloweth up death and victory.30 As in the account of Genesis, the Instructor appears again as a formof the Serpent, which in this case has the form of the Lion-Serpent,an aspect of The Beast 666.31 He first commands that the stars (thehost of mankind) be burned up in the fire of his nostrils,32 and declaresthe hierarchies of heaven and hell to be as specks of dust dancingwithin the creative Eye of Hoor.33 Then, he makes the statement ofrevelation: “I am he that swalloweth up death and victory.”This phrase recalls Isaiah Chapter 25, where the Lord of Hosts() 34 is addressed as a coming Messiah.And in this mountain shall the Lord of Hosts make unto allpeople a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees,of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well-"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well-refined.And he will destroy in this mountain the face of thecovering cast over all people, and the veil that is spreadover all nations.He will swallow up death in victory.35The phrase, “this mountain” in Isaiah refers to Zion, the Mountain ofGod, which we identify with BABALON.36 Comparison should be madebetween the feast described in Isaiah and that in The Book of theLaw I:5137 and Liber VII, VI:36–39 quoted above.

As we learn from The Book ofLies,The cause of sorrow is the desire of the One to the Many,or of the Many to the One.

Someof Crowley’s first studies in the constitution of the human organism asinterpreted in the Vedantic tradition were published in The EquinoxVolume 1, Number 4 in The Temple of Solomon the King.12The Five Sheaths of the soul are as follows:13annamaya kośa, — the material sheath 14prāamaya kośa, — vital or life force thatanimates (prāa) manomaya kośa, — the illusory sheath ofthoughtvijñānamaya kośa, — the sheath made ofconsciousnessanandamaya kośa, — the sheath of blissEach of these sheaths are described as illusory veils surroundingĀtman— the true self or eternal center of consciousness. This centeris ultimately i dentified with Brahman, , considered as theAbsolute or Ultimate Godhead.15Crowley quickly became disenchanted with Vedantic religion which isbased on the belief in Brahman as the Supreme Cause of theUniverse, in the precise sense of an omnipresent and sole God. Hispractices of Yoga did not dissuade him from the realization of thereality of the Sheaths of illusion that surround the true self; but hebalked at the assertion that a conscientious pursuit of the InwardJourney would lead one to a singularity that was ultimately identified as the One God.

If we examine the Rose closer,we have optical and olfactory Sensations of color and fragrance,vedanā, that expand our characterization and comprehension of theRose.

He considered the Skandha of Perception to be moredifficult to conquer than the lower Skandhas because it operates onthe Unconscious level, and must be made Conscious before it can bedestroyed. Perception also creates a dualism by the establishment ofa “point of view”: There is THAT, which in Form, Sensation, andPerception is called “Rose,” and there is THIS which observes THAT.However, this may be converted directly into the state of PureConsciousness or viññāa. In Crowley’s words: “The rose and theobserver and their tendencies and relations have somehow vanished.The phenomenon (not the original phenomenon, ‘a rose,’ but thephenomenon of the tendency to perceive the sensation of a rose)becomes a cloudless light; a static, no longer a dynamic conception."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"becomes a cloudless light; a static, no longer a dynamic conception.One has somehow got behind the veil of the universe.” 20 The Buddhist method then carries this to an ultimate “Next Step.”Even pure consciousness (viññāa) is said to be likewise a falsehood,like all things, bound to the nature of The Three Characteristics ofSorrow, dukkha; Change or “Impermanence,” anica; andUnsubstantiality or “Not Self,”21 anatta. Likewise, the doctrine ofThelema pronounces a similar theme. In Liber LXV, The HolyGuardian Angel affirmed to The Prophet:Thou shalt be ever the heart, and I the serpent will coilclose about thee. My coils shall never relax throughoutthe æons. Neither change nor sorrow nor unsubstantialityshall have thee; for thou art passed beyond all these.Even as the diamond shall glow red for the rose, andgreen for the ro se-leaf; so shalt thou abide apart from theImpressions.22For a practical means of reaching some comprehension of theprecepts of the Five Sheaths of the Soul, the Student should performthe practice of mahāsatipahāna, which is a means of establishing‘mindfulness’ or non-reactive awareness.23 In this practice, there is no“I” identity with the thing being observed. It is the meditation of theonion skins of the Skandhas that answers the question, ‘What is itthat is being observed?’This is closely akin to a practice undertaken by any who wouldb ecome a Master of the Temple. We pay no heed to chanceoccurrences, accidents, deliberate or natural actions, but perceive inall of these a means to clarify the object in view, namely the falsesense of Self, and finally are enabled “to interpret every phenomenonas a particular dealing of God with the soul.” The astute Student willnote that I have said “the soul” and not “my soul.” Soul is but a perception, a means in which we attempt to discriminatethe one from the many. Beyond this Perception of the Soul is viññāa,“consciousness,” which is nonetheless a false-hood itself—animpersonal Monad bound up in the fabric of the Three Characteristicsof Sorrow, Change, and Unsubstantiality.

Crowley’s rejection of Hinduism restedpredominately on their assertion of Ātman as the center of theSheaths of the Soul, and Ātman as a form of the One God Brahman.Judaism, whose brilliant Qabalists formulated a concept of Creatio ExNihilo24 with th e appearance of Ain, the Nothingness beyondKether, found the Rabbis incapable of declaring that God was Not,but insisting that by Nothing they really meant “One.”25 Even thestringent rationale of the Buddha fell victim to a choking literaldogmatism that rendered the conception of The Three Characteristicsno more than the summit of Rational Thought (Ruach). Nirvāa ,26 the supreme goal of Buddhism, is only—in the final analysis—thereordering of the mind by disengaging attachment to the world(liberation) and a resultant sense of peace and awareness. The wordNirvāa simply means “cessation.” The infinite Nothing still loomsbeyond nirvāa, which is commonly misinterpreted and reduced tomerely another expression of Oneness draped in the garments ofnihilism.The revelation of the Law of Thelema was the shattering blow to theconcept of the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism: the truth of Sorrow,the truth of the Origin of Sorrow, the truth of the Cessation of Sorrow,and the truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Sorrow. As Thelemites, we are admonished to remember “that existence ispure joy; that all the sorrows are but as shadows; they pass & aredone; but there is that which remains.”27Any who peel away the onion skins of the Five Sheaths of the Soul,moving ever more inward, and perceiving that the ThreeCharacteristics are mere reflections of the S upernal Triad,28 will notfind Ātman at the center linked to some fictional Brahman. But ratherwe will find Kether, which we also name Yechidah, , the “OnlyOne.” It is the spark of Godhead that we also call Hadit, the SecretCore of our own Star, who is One and None.

(Psalm8:6)38In The Zohar, these Gates of Understanding correspond to theSephira Binah, the Supernal Mother. From the book called Terumahin the Zohar:We have learnt that Wisdom (Chokmah) beat against thestones of the thirty-two Paths and caused the wind togather many waters into one place. Then fifty Gates ofUnderstanding (Binah) were opened. From the pathsemanated ten luminous crowns, and there were lefttwenty-two Paths. The wind whirled down those Pathsand fifty Gates of Understanding were opened, and thetwenty-two letters were engraved upon fifty Gates of theJubilee and were crowned with the seventy-two letters ofthe Holy Name.”39It is a reasonable question to wonder why the number of the Gates befifty and not some other number. This is cryptically explained in thebook Sifra de-Tsni’uta in the Zohar: (Yod ) is in a certain sense solitary, but in a plainlycontrary sense. For it ascendeth in its path upwards andupwards. The Woman (i.e. Shekinah) is again hidden, andthe Mother (i.e. Binah) is illuminated and is opened outinto her gates.

Therefore the numerical sum of Kolis fifty, for all that is created came from the fifty gates ofBinah, and the sign for all creation is Kol. The profoundunderstanding of this is in the essence of the verse: “AndGod saw Kol (all) that He had done and behold it wasvery good.” (Genesis 1:31)42The significance of the Rite of Counting the Omer is found in thelegend of the children of Israel who waited for the presentation of theTorah, or Law. After they left Egypt, Moses informed them that 49days after the Exodus, they would be given the Torah. Thus, theykept counting the days until they were given the Torah at the base ofSinai, the mountain of God. For Jews this time is a time for reflectionupon the past while contemplating the coming day of celebrationcommemorating the delivery of the Law.Gates of DeathIn the final Initiation of Frater o μη 43 into the Grade of MagisterTempli, in the 14th Aethyr of The Vision and the Voice it was revealedunto him that,Fifty are the gates of understanding, and one hundredand six are the seasons thereof.

The Path of the Great Return is theaverse Path, moving from the world of Death unto Conception andbeyond:Death—Life—Birth—Gestation—Conception—Universion—Omniversion—NulliversionRe-entry into the womb of Binah in this sequence equates toGestation. For the Candidate to be readied for this transition, each ofthe Fifty Gates must be passed, one at a time. Forty-nine of theseare the Gates that are found in the world of Death that the world callsLife—corresponding to the Seven Sephiroth below the Abyss. Forexample, the first Seven gates represent Malkuth in Malkuth, Yesodin Malkuth, Hod in Malkuth, Netzach in Malkuth, Tiphereth in Malkuth,Geburah in Malkuth, and finally Chesed in Malkuth.

This is the Gate thattraditional Qabalah says is completely hidden, the Gate that Moseswas not allowed to enter. The Twofold CrossingIn Chapter 3 of this work I discussed the doctrine of the twofoldcrossing of the Abyss. In this place it is necessary to elaborate thatthesis.In order to cross the Abyss in its fullest sense, that cr ossing must beconsolidated on the Intellectual plane, which is the Ruachexperienced by the path of Zayin, The Lovers or Atu VI. Likewise, itmust be consolidated on the Emotional or Instinctual plane of theNephesh by the path of Heh, The Star or Atu XVII. This is anotherreason why Tzaddi cannot be The Star in this Aeon.What exactly do we mean when we say “cross the Abyss?”"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"It is to pass from a condition wherein consciousness differentiatesitself by processes of ego-filtered linear thought and instinctualmodeling, to a condition wherein consciousness is one and none withthe Universal Life, without egoic or instinctual differentiation.First, it is crucial to understand that I am not talking aboutexperiencing a trance state such as samādhi, , or other hightrances.For example, take the trance of Ātmadarśana, . In the experience of Ātmadarśana one is able to “apprehend” the Universeas a single phenomenon beyond time, beyond space, and beyondcausality.For another example, Śivadarśana, , which is beyondĀtmadarśana, may be considered the trance state where thecomprehensions of Ātmadarśana are annihilated altogether. Both arevery exalted trances indeed, but it is a mistake to assume that theattainment of Śivadarśana, or even Ātmadarśana, are the same thingas crossing the Abyss. The reason it is not true is that all trancestates are temporary conditions.This holds true for the samādhi of nirvikalpa, as well as theso-called “permanent” state of sahaja nirvikalpa samādhi,, which is said to persist in waking, sleeping, anddreaming. Explanations of sahaja nirvikalpa samādhi describe theguru as being able to “remain” in that state without effort.

However, uponconclusion of the trance state, the aspirant is essentially unchangedexcept perhaps in the level of comprehension of his or place in theUniverse, and the veils of illusion that conceal those with which weconstantly labor. However, crossing the Abyss is another thingaltogether. On this point, Crowley was adamant.45 In crossing theAbyss fully, aspirants are fundamentally changed in their entire being,permanently. They will never be the same again. A change will bewrought in the fabric of their Psychic structures and processes. TheEgo is destroyed. Elements once taken for granted as essentialcomponents of the Psyche may be annihilated; others, completelyrearranged. And new components appear unannounced andunbidden. All is built anew; a new child is born. Like the birth of a newchild, there is much pain and anguish—at least in our currentevolutionary stage and from our own point of view. From the point ofview of the Masters of the Temple, it is seen otherwise:Thus is it seen from below by them that understand not.But from above he rejoiceth, for the joy of dissolution isten thousand, and the pang of birth but a little.46It is here necessary to qualify the statement above that “the Ego isdestroyed.” I want to be perfectly clear on this point. The core of theego faculty is not destroyed by this process. It cannot be, otherwiseone would be catatonic and unable to function at all in the world ofconsciousness. The “seed” of the Ego-making faculty (Ruach) retainsa state of viability necessary to eventually process the new constructsthat this Initiation brings about.What then is destroyed?It is the elaborate, structured matrix of linear thought that is shatteredand falls like a fragile scaffold of ivory straws, and with it, theidentification of self with the Ego-making faculty that remains. This iswhat the Hindus call the manomaya kośa, -, the Illusorysheath of thought, and what the Buddhists refer to as sakhāra, theTendencies.

This is a complete psychicdisintegration, a highly dangerous state that is rightly feared byAnalytical Psychology. Undertaken without the most seriouspreparations and spiritual readiness, it can result in a severe andirreversible condition of psychopathology. It is worthwhile here toconsider the words of One Star In Sight:Any neophyte of the Order (or, as some say, any personsoever) possesses the right to claim the Grade of Masterof the Temple by taking the Oath of the Grade. It is hardlynecessary to observe that to do so is the most sublimeand awful responsibility which it is possible to assume,and an unworthy person who does so incurs the mostterrific penalties by his presumption.47FallingIn similar manner to the counting of the Omer, passage through eachof the outer 49 Gates requires a new and heightened evaluation ofthe individual stages of development comprised in the SevenSephiroth below the Abyss. This is not some quiet little meditationwherein we thumb through the playing cards of our Initiatic past. It isan excruciating experience of psychic and spiritual surgery withoutanesthesia. The requirement is , “all.”Thou shalt drain out thy blood that is thy life into thegolden cup of her fornication. Thou shalt mingle thy lifewith the universal life. Thou shalt keep not back one drop.Then shall thy brain be dumb, and thy heart beat no more,and all thy life shall go from thee; and thou shalt be castout upon the midden, and the birds of the air shall feastupon thy flesh, and thy bones shall whiten in the sun.48With each succeeding Gate passed, the distance between our frailconcept of individuality and participation in the world of mankindgrows greater. Exactly in the manner of one who leaps into a chasm,there is the constant sensation of falling, slipping away from all that isknown, losing all sense of connection to self, loved ones andconsciousness itself.

There, according to the Book of Matthew, he said untohis disciples,My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; tarry yehere, and watch with me. And he went a little further, andfell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it bepossible, let this cup pass from me...55The apostle Luke added to this description of his Master’s suffering:And there appeared an Angel unto him from heaven,strengthening him.

It does behoove us to discover exactly what that resonancewas, and benefit from its wisdom.Gethsemane, Γεθσημαν, was the place of the olive-presses, at thefoot of Mount Olivet.57 To render the pure oil of the olive, the fruit mustbe crushed and then carefully refined. In the mythos of Jesus Christ,he is placed in the Garden of the olive-presses in the dark nightbefore he is to confront his crucifixion, the necessary prelude toentering into his glory as the Messiah. It is therefore a fitting symbolof the aspirant to Binah, who will undergo a process that may belikened unto the preparati on of this oil. This parallels the symbolismof the “wine-press of the wrath of God” (ληνòν τo θυμo τo θεo) inthe Book of Revelation chapter 1458 as well as that of verse 56 inLiber VII, Chapter III:"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Thou shalt crush me in the wine-press of Thy love.

Their inability to give all thatis the source of their ultimate curse.It is, I believe, the desire to cling stubbornly to the attachments of thisworld, attempting to pray “let this Cup pass from me,” that binds us tothe price of suffering when we sacrifice ourselves to that Cup. Wehave the promise of The Book of Lies that as more Initiates come andgo from the Great Sea, spilling drops of that water of Life as they go,one day that Abyss will flower.61 One day, that great gulf between theRealm of the Actual and the Realm of the Ideal will be as a little ditchrequiring little more than a careful step.

First is theunveiling of his Mother Nuit. The second is the self-violation of hisSister wife Isis, or Nature. This cry, suggesting that some stablecommandment has been broken, had its origins, not in Egypt, but inthe Old Testament book of Leviticus. In this book of laws whichMoses delivered unto the Israelites, one clearly declared it forbiddenfor anyone to uncover the nakedness of one’s Mother.the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover; sheis thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 68In the doctrine of the Jewish Qabalists, the Mother was interpreted asthe Sephira Binah, the Great Mother, even as the Daughter came tobe interpreted as Malkuth.

Therevelation that the Khabs is in the Khu was certainly a large portion ofthe new doctrine that would rock the foundations of the Aeon of theFather, but it was not the only one. For the first time, the way to theAbyss was opened; a system was to be presented that allowedentrance to the Supernal Triad to any who so willed it.The uncovering of Shekinah as Mother or Daughter is equivalent tothe lifting of the veil of the goddess Athena, which the Greeksidentified with Isis. Plutarch recorded the famous inscription at theTemple of Athena at Sais:I am all that has been, and is, and shall be. No mortalhath ever raised my veil.70The veil of the Saitic Isis has been lifted at long last—not for thosedesignated as “worthy” by a jealous priesthood, but for all men andwomen—stars in the body of heaven, who by declaration of their Willsbound by their Deeds, may throw open the Gates of Heaven and lookupon the face of Wisdom in the Temple of Athena.Those of us who have embraced the Law of Thelema have theprecious promise that if we but endure unto the end, as didPerdurabo—Prophet, Priest and Prince—we too may share in theglorious experience of Light, Life, Love, Force, Fantasy and Fire.

Forus to understand the development of Thelema as the supplanter ofthese great Western religions, it is vital to examine the historicalmatrix within which it appeared, and those elements which had adirect influence on our Prophet. The co nception of a holy covenant isone of those elements, and a very significant one.In the Old Testament we find the beginning of the doctrine of thecovenant. The relationship of God with the Israelites in all its forms,particularly in his aspect as Jehovah, was based on ritual violenceand the shedding of blood.The first covenant in the book of Genesis is called the NoahicCovenant, which according to the myth was affirmed after God hadannihilated all living things with the exception of Noah and his family,by means of a global flood.72 In this covenant God swore never todestroy the earth by a flood again. 73 The celestial sign of thiscovenant was the appearance of the rainbow there-after, which wasto be a sign unto man that God had promised not to destroy the earthby water again. It was also to serve as a reminder to God that he hadmade this promise. It is not recorded whether this last bit of reasoninggave Noah and his clan a little pause concerning the memory of suchan omnipotent God.74The second covenant recorded is called the Abrahamic Covenant,which the Jews call , brit bein habetarim, “Covenantbetween the parts.” It began with a dismembering of sacrificialanimals. Abram cut a number of animals into two pieces ascommanded by God in a vision; he then beheld the presence ofJehovah as a smoking furnace and a torch of fire passing betweenthe pieces of flesh. The King James Bible translation reads, “In thatday, Jehovah made a covenant with Abram.”75 The Hebrew is morespecific: . “In that day, Jehovah cut acovenant with Abram.” The word means “to cut off,” and in itsoriginal sense, a covenant was affirmed by the cutting of flesh, andpassing between the pieces. It is from this that the third covenantappears, when Jehovah commanded Abraham to circumcise himselfand to impose the requirement upon every male child of eight d aysof age, the brit milah, , covenant of circumcision.76"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"The next covenant was the Mosaic covenant, first described inExodus, chapters 19–24. This covenant resulted in the written andoral Torah, with the gift of the Sabbath as permanent sign of itsaffirmation. There is, of course, the usual touch of Jehovah’s mindset:a penalty of death for any Israelite who desecrates the Sabbath, andexpulsion from the company of Israel for any who performs work onthat day.Two more covenants follow. The brit ha-kehuna, , thepriestly covenant , was an agreement between God and the AaronicPriesthood, the descendents of Aaron, brother of Moses. Then, theDavidic covenant which established David and his descendents askings of the monarchy of Israel.77 This latter covenant is an essentialcomponent in Jewish Messianism as well as in Christian doctrine. I nJewish eschatology, the Messiah is to be a Jewish king from thelineage of David. It is believed that he will restore all Jews in the landof Israel, build the Third Temple in Jerusalem and establish onceagain the Sanhedrin and rule the Jewish people during the Messianicage. It is precisely upon this covenant that Christianity based its claimthat Jesus was the expected Messiah. Following the declaration thatthe Bible was infallible, Jesus had to fulfill the requirements definedby the Davidic covenant. Jewish theologians naturally reject the claimthat Jesus satisfies these requirements. For Christian theologians, theclaim of the Davidic lineage is essential for the belief in the futurereign of Jesus Christ on the earth as King of kings. They furthermoreclaim he was the embodiment of the New Covenant, first mentionedin the Old Testament in th e book of Jeremiah.Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make anew covenant with the house of Israel, and with the houseof Judah.78This verse was later to be quoted in the New Testament book ofHebrews as evidence that the Mosaic covenant had been supersededby Jesus Christ who, as the mediator between God and Man, hadestablished a more perfect covenant.79 Even within this myth, there isonce again the shedding of blood and passing between the pieces,echoing the old blood lust of Jehovah.

The resulting intellectual wrangling led to theinevitable attempt to identify Ain with God, effectively mitigating the implication that Ain or Ain Sophpreceded the appearance of the One. The attempts to reconcile these ideas often bordered on theabsurd, such as the statement by David b. Abraham ha-Lavan in (13th century) who defined Ain as“having more being than any other being in the world, but since it is so simple, and all ot her simplethings are complex when compared with its simplicity, so in comparison it is called ‘Nothing.’”(Scholem, Kabbalah, p. 95)26 Nibbāna in Pāli.27 The Book of the Law, II, 9.28 Unsubstantiality is a reflection of Kether, Change that of Chokmah, and Sorrow an influence ofBinah.29 See Chapter 3, Lamed, “The Final Adjustment.”30 Cf.

Herein we see another Archetypal expression of theconcept of crossing the Abyss. For disobeying Yahweh (cf. Numbers 20:7–12), standing upon MountNebo, Moses was allowed to behold the distant promised land, but was not allowed to cross over. TheLord told Moses, “I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.”(Deuteronomy 34:4) He was therefore “but a little lower than a god,” having to remain in Chesed. Thelegend of Moses (or Mosheh) is interpreted in another way by Crowley, who considered him to havebeen a Master of the Temple and a Magus, who declared his Word IHVH. See The Book of Lies,Chapter 7, “The Dinosaurs” and Liber Aleph, Chapter 73. The Jewish myth follows a strictly Judaic-shaped Archetypal pattern; in their view, only the Messiah would be able to open the final Gate ofBinah.

They are us, in more fullyconscious representations.12 Specifically, in this reference, thegoddess Isis is representative of the natural world; she is nature itself,the world in which we live. Her mate is Osiris, the Lord of the Dead ,the world of the Qliphoth. As I have noted, in the system of AAeach Candidate who seeks Initiation is initially mystically identifiedwith Osiris.13This particular verse of Liber A’ash gives us great insight into thenature of the New Aeon, and the symbolic makeup of the aspirant—fully realized in the attainment of the candidate to the Grade ofMaster of the Temple, as discussed in chapter 6.The outward form of the Candidate is that of Hoor; it is He that isthrice armed, for He bears the inherited strength of the two previous"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"thrice armed, for He bears the inherited strength of the two previousAeons of Isis and Osiris, his Mother and Father.

If weignore the gems of beauty and wisdom, as well as the evil andignorance in our own history, the tapestry of our personal andcollective futures will be weakly woven. As Edmund Burke said,“People will not look forward to posterity, who never look backward totheir ancestors.”14It is important to remember that Hoor is the Hawk-Headed Lord ofSilence as well as the Lord of Strength.15 His twin Harpocrates, theLord of Silence, is said to be “hidden within him.” This description isof particular interest, and offers useful clues to aid our understandingof these symbols. HarpocratesFirst, we should note that the image of Hoor is a theriocephalicfigure,16 having the head of a bird and the body of a man. Conversely,the figure of Harpocrates (from the Greek ‘Aρπoκράτης) isanthropomorphic; he is represented as completely human. The formthat Archetypes take when becoming conscious images are clearindicators of certain components of that figure. When we see a deitywith an animal or bird head, we know immediately that this figure isclose to the Unconscious; because it has a huma n body in form, weknow that it dwells among us, but has not entirely taken on our visage. This is not the image that you and I behold when we look inthe mirror. This image is telling us, “Take note, you are in thepresence of a visitor from the Unconscious.”Technically speaking, the term Archetype really only applies to thesecont ents while they are still a psychoid factor, that is, a component ofthe Unconscious which has not yet been contaminated by interactionwith consciousness. In this state, these factors are still available forimmediate psychic experience, which is always modified by theind ividual experiencing them.17 When we meet them in visions ordreams, the representation of the Archetypes are more naïve andprimal, less comprehensible to our minds.

The Greeksand Romans later misinterpreted this posture of finger sucking astheir own similar gesture which meant to be silent. The earliest knownmention of this was made by Marcus Terentius Varro, who would writein De Lingua Latina (circa 45 BCE), “Harpocrates with his fingermakes a sign for me to be silent.”22By the early part of the fourth century, the interpretation ofHarpocrates as a god of silence is found in the mag ical literature inthe so-called Mithras Liturgy as part of a spell to serve as protectionduring a ritual Invocation:When the gods stare at you and r ush towardsyou,immediately pu t your right finger to yourmouth and say:‘Silence!

From this, it is apparent that Set continued tosatisfy broader mythological criteria beyond simple demoniccharacterizations. It is my contention that he still does. Set is notconsidered an evil entity in the modern symbolism of Thelema. 62 The name of Set was written Σήθ by the Greeks, which approximateswell with the common spelling of his name in Hieroglyphs as (stš).63 By modern etymological standards, the actual meaning of thename Set is completely unknown. However, there are some cluesthat we can glean from historical accounts and from secondarymeanings attached to the name from similarities in sound.Plutarch, who identified Set with the Greek god Typhon (Tυν),stated that the name Set meant “oppressing and compelling”(καταδυναστεύω καταβιάζομαι)64 to the Egyptians.65 There is noreason to believe that this was an invention of Plutarch. It appearsquite reasonable this idea originated with the Egyptians who werefond of making word puns. From Plutarch’s account, it would seemthat the Egyptians were attempting their own etymology of the name.By taking the name of Set (stš) as the word (t t)“disordered,” or (tštš) “crush,” preceded by a causative (aphonetic “s”),66 one can arrive at verbs which are quite close to themeaning of Set’s name according to the account of Plutarch.In the year 1885, Dr. Heinrich Brugsch made a comparison with thenames of Hoor and Set to the Coptic words “above,” and “below,” respectively. 67 We now know that was derived from (rw), “upper part, above.”68 The name of Hoor while perhapsnot directly linked to this word etymologically, is certainly connected torw and related words by association, anciently having the meaningof “He who is abov e” or similar. 69 In the Pyramid text of Unas forexample, his name written (r) occurs 32 times in 31 differentSpells which clearly suggests that at a very early period theEgyptians understood the name of Horus in precisely that fashion.70The normal spelling of his name in the Pyramid Texts is simply (r). This is not to argue for a direct etymological link, but such plays onwords were widely used by the Egyptians themselves.71The Archetypal oppositions of “above” and “below,” sun above theearth, hero above antagonist, good above evil, are natural oppositesconfigured by the need of consciousness to maintain figures ofwholeness."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"In the land of Egypt, Horus was considered to be lord of the deltaregion of Egypt in the North, while Set was lord of the desert region in the South.

This is of particular interest to us, for it demonstratesclearly that there was a secret teaching associated with these twogods beyond what was commonly revealed about them. If weunderstand the word (wd) as “disce rn,” then we mayunderstand Set as (wd ) “The discerner.” The Egy ptiansrecognized two basic forms of discernment: (wd h3bt)“to discern crookedness,” and (wd m3t) “to discernMaat (that which is straight).” Anything that was in balance, that wastrue or righteous, was “straight.” Anything that was not Maat was“crooked.” To interpret Set as “the discerner” is to place him in therole of the judge of men’s hearts, to separate the true from the false.75 The apparent contradictions in the character of Set are so widelyseparated that rational explanations have failed to solve the problem.How indeed can a god of chaos and destruction, proclaimed as themurderer of Osiris, be, on the other hand, invoked to protect the solarbark of Ra? How can the opponent of Horus be the same god who,with Horus, unites the Two Lands in harmony? Here again, we maydetect the presence of a secret teaching that embodies a complexoppositorum that is a rebuke to reason. In the New Aeon, thesy mbolism of the god Set transcends the Abyss, which by defaulttells us that it comprehends its own contradiction.

The Latin root ofthe word, adulterium, first appeared in The Vulgate Bible (4th century) as a translation of the Greekword μoιχάω which occurs six times in four verses. The use of adulterium for sex outside of wedlockwas the result of religious prejudices, rather than intrinsic meaning and etymology. The wordadulterate is first found in The Works of Sir Thomas More in 1557 as a past particle with the sense of“corruption.” (The Confutation of Tyndale’s Answer, Part 2) The word adultery is later found in BenJohnson’s Masque titled, Mercury Vindicated From the Alchemists (1615) with this same sense. SeeGifford, The Works of Ben Jonson, p. 596. This is another form of the traditional Alchemical aphorismthat all generation relies on prior corruption. “For without corruption, there can no generation consist.”(Corpus Hermeticum, XV, 40 from Jennings, The Divine Pymander of Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus,translated from the Arabick by Dr. Everard, p. 103).13 See Initiation in the Aeon of the Child, chapter 2, The Awaking for a discussion of this topic."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"14 Burke, Reflections on the Revolution i n France, second edition, p. 48.15 The Book of the Law, III:70. 16 From Greek θηρίoν “beast” and κεαλή “head.”17 Jacobi, Complex/Archetype/Symbol, p. 31 ff.18 Erman, Wörterbuch der Aegyptischen Sprache, Vol. 3, p. 123.19 A modern rendering, sometimes giv en Heru-pa-khered.

The Egyptian word for the delta region was (T3-mw) whichdoes not mean “lower” at all. It means simply “land of the north,” and is etymologically connected with (m t), “flood waters.” Likewise, the word translated as “upper Egypt” is (T3-šmw) meaning simply, “land of the south.” (Faulkner, Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptians, p. 114;Erman, Wörterbuch der Aegyptischen Sprache, Vol. 5, p. 224 & 227).73 Erman, Ibid.

In otherwords, Jehovah himself w as ultimately the author of Sin for he wasthe creator of Satan. (“it is the origin of good and evil; it is the creationof the demon by mystery.”) Levi is understandably very guarded inthis matter, for this idea is a heresy of the Roman Catholic Church.If we carefully examine the drawing by Eliphas Levi, we can see thewords in Latin at the top, “PER BENEDICTIONEN MALE-DICTVS ADVMBRATV” meaning, “By the blessing of the cursed isforeshadowed.”15 Furthermore, the shadow of the hand suggests thehead of the Devil. In a humorous way, Levi is paying homage to an old superstition thatheld if one stood in the shadow of the Pope, the Pope’s blessingwould turn into a curse. To this day, superstitious people in Italy willtake great care to avoid standing in his shadow. But this is all a jest.This is not what he wants us to discover.

WhileLevi did not elaborate on his drawing in the text of Dogme et Rituel dela Haute Magie, he did remind us to recall the Alchemical aphorism,“That which is above is like unto that which is below, and that which isbelow is like unto that which is above.”17 Furthermore, he informed thereader that,form is proportional to the idea; the shadow is themeasure of the body calculated in its relation to the beamof light; the scabbard is as deep as the sword is long; thenegation is proportional to the contrary assertion... and"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"negation is proportional to the contrary assertion... andthere is no point in infinite space that is not the center of acircle whose circumference expands and contractsindefinitely in space.18Examine this closely, for Levi is saying that the nature of God is likethat of a circle whose center is everywhere and whosecircumf erence is nowhere found. That should sound familiar toanyone who has read The Book of the Law:In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she, thecircumference, is nowhere found.19That particular philosophical idea is encountered numerous timesthroughout history. Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) used it in his Pensées(“Thoughts”).20 It is generally conceded that Pascal found that quote inthe preface written by Marie de Gournay for the 1635 edition ofMichel de Montiagne’s Essais,21 taken by her from Rabelais (1494–1553), Gargantua & Pantagruel Book III, chapter 13, where it isattributed to Hermes Trismegistus.22 St. Bonaventure (1221–1274)used this same phrase in Itinerarium Mentis in Deum,23 as did Alain deLille (1116–1202) in his Theologicæ Regulæ.24 Ernest Havet, acceptsthe authority of Vincent de Beauvais (1200–1264) who in the firstchapter of Speculum Historiale (“Mirror of History”) ascribed it toEmpedocles in the fifth century BC. This remains the generallyaccept ed scholarly opinion.25Now the casual reader might opine that Levi didn’t say anythingabout the nature of God there. No, he didn’t.

Levi knew the work ofRabelais very well.The nature of God is a wholeness, not fragmented into a light halfthat is adored and a dark half that is shunned as the devil. As amagical formula, we may paraphrase Eliphas Levi to say that by theblessing of IAO, OAI is foreshad owed. More than foreshadowed, OAI isone half of the original whole. Reuniting the two divorced halvestogether again is the task of the magician who seeks transcendenceof the world of dualism.In yet another drawing by Eliphas Levi, we see a demonstration ofthat wholeness.

Yet, there is an instruction concerningthis matter that was passed down through the AA directly from theProphet himself, that is generally unknown to those outside thatOrder.The declaration of “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law” isnot a greeting.

That refrain i s in turn a counter-challenge toacknowledge the full matrix of the Truth of the Law.

When they have been granted the honor and privilege of that GreatInitiation we call the Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel they are then known as an Adeptus Minor Within,and are received among the Brethren of the Red Rose and theGolden Cross.This is one of the most important and beloved subjects contained inthe doctrine of Thelema. It is one of two subjects that I consider ourmost Sacred Spiritual inheritance. Crowley called it “The Next Step”for humankind.2 The Sacred Magic of Abramelin The MageIt is important to determine the origin of the term, Holy GuardianAngel because this is a phrase that has perplexed and confounded somany who have sought to understand this Path of Initiation. We know that Aleister Crowley became familiar with the term throughThe Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, a magicalwork translated into English by S. L. MacGregor Mathers andpublished in 1898. Mathers translated this work from the Frenchversion he found in the Library of the Arsenal in Paris. It purported tobe a translation from a Hebrew original dating from 1458 and writtenby a Jew named Abraham of Worms.

A critical edition comparing the variouseditions has been produced by George Dehn.3 It is based on twoGerman manuscripts, both dated 1608. The French translation, fromwhich Mathers worked, was made about 1750.)It is fairly certain that Mathers’ English edition of the book is thesource of t he phrase “Holy Guardian Angel,” although the morecommon term throughout the text is simply “the guardian Angel.”However, in Mathers’ introduction, we find the union with this Angeldescribed as, “the Knowledge of and Conversation with the HolyGu ardian Angel.”The Meaning of the Holy Guardian AngelIt is normal for a beginner to ask, “What is meant by the phrase ‘TheHoly Guardian Angel?’” My response has always been to give anoverall view of what the Brothers of AA mean by that term.However, I make it perfectly clear that I cannot define exactly whatthe Holy Guardian Angel truly is. No one can.If anyone attempts to declare specifically what the Holy GuardianAngel is, or should they pretend to know, one should be on guard, forthat individual is at best deluded, or at worst, a fraud.The same applies to those who chatter shamelessly in public trying toimpres s others with their spiritual attainment, by talking about “myAngel this” or “my Angel that”—as casually as they might discuss anew film or any other profane matter. For those who have trulyattained to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Angel, silence onthe matter comes natural; the living experience is a profo und andHoly thing. It is shielded under the shadow of the Wings, protectedfrom profane eyes beneath the Rose and the Cross.None of us are advanced enough, or exalted enough, to overcomethe limitations of human reason and emotion that would allow us toaccurately communicate the grandeur and holiness of this GreatTruth. Even if we could, I’m not sure we would. But I know for a factthat we can’t.You must come to this Sanctuary on your own. You must experiencethis for yourself, and in the silence of your own Soul.

Then, andonly then, will you know.One could perhaps come closer by defining what the Holy GuardianAngel is not, than attempting to define what the Holy Guardian Angelis. It is useful to attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff. So letus attempt to cast some light on popular erroneous assumptions andfalse teachings about the Angel.Please keep in mind that any such description is merely an overallconcept of what the AA means by this term. Even so, we mustproceed cautiously. It should be noted that a description of thefunction and methodology of the Holy Guardian Angel does notattempt to offer anything specific about the NATURE of the HolyGuardian Angel.In my previous book, Initiation in the Aeon of the Child, I defined theHoly Guardian Angel as:a term used to indicate the transpersonal Entity whoserves as the True Spiritual Instructor for an aspirant.Sometimes called “The Higher Divine Self” or “The HigherGenius,” neither of which is correct or satisfactory .4Transpersonal means “beyond personal,” that is, totally distinct fromthe personal consciousness or personal unconscious. The Angel isthe “True Spiritual Instructor” of an aspirant.The Concept of a Holy Guardian AngelThe premise of the Holy Guardian Angel as an Archetype has beencentral to a number of spiritual traditions over the centuries. We findreferences to this Mystery under a variety of names in differentcultures, all attempting to find a suitable word that in some measureis successful in conveying the deep and complex doctrines thatsurround it.Due to the limitation of all languages, we must concede that all suchterms have failed to successfully convey the essential Spiritual Truthof the matter, including the phrase, “Holy Guardian Angel.”This is a problem not limited merely to this term.

He believed that he had a Spiritual Guide who aided him inhis daily life, and he called this Spiritual Guide a δαίμων.We transliterate this word into English as “daemon” in order todistinguish from the interpretation it is given in the Judeo-Christianliterature, where we find the same Greek word rendered “demon,”and understood as a ma levolent spirit of some type.For Plato, the word daemon meant a supernatural entity that was ona level between mortals and the gods. In the dialogue Symposium,while discussing Love personified as a spiritual being, the nature ofthe daemon is described to Socrates as the mediator between manand god:“He is a great spirit (δαίμων), Socrates, and like all spirits(δαιμóνιoν), is intermediate between the divine and themortal.”“And what,” I said, “is his power?”“He interprets,” she replied, “between gods and men,conveying and taking across to the gods the prayers andsacrifices of men, and to men the commands and repliesof the gods; he is the mediator who spans the chasmwhich divides them, and therefore in him all is boundtogether, and through him the arts of the prophet and thepriest, their sacrifices and mysteries and charms, and allprophecy and incantation, find their way.

Many and multifariousare these spirits (δαίμoνες), and one of them is Love.”8In the earlier writings of Homer, the Olympians are referred to as“gods” (Θεoι) and “divinities” (δαίμoνης). These words are essentiallysynonymous. It is in later writers such as Plato that a distinction isdrawn between the two.In his dialogue Cratylus, Plato gives the etymology of the wordδαίμoνης as from δαήμoνες, which means “knowledgeable or wise.”This, then, I think, is what he (Hesiod) certainly means tosay of the spirits (δαίμoνας): because they were wise andknowing (δαήμoνες) he called them spirits (δαίμoνες) andin the old form of our language the two words are thesame.9"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"Plato, from Thomas Stanley’s History of Philosophy(1687)For Plato, the Spiritual Guide was an entity that was beyond himself,but lesser in stature than the gods — greater than mortal men, butnot yet as exalted as the divi nities.

It is well-knownthat Socrates’ believed in what was called his “daemonic sign,” anaverting (πoτρεπτικóς) inner voice that he heard if he was on theverge of making an error in judgment. Plato recounts this in hisApology:I have had this from my childhood; it is a sort of voice thatcomes to me, and when it comes it always holds me backfrom what I am thinking of doing, but never urges meforward. This it is which opposes my engaging in politics.11In Phaedrus, Plato stated that Socrates declared the inner voice to bedistinct from his own thoughts.My good friend, when I was about to cross the stream, thespirit and the sign that usually comes to me came—italways holds me back from something I am about to do—and I thought I heard a voice from it which forbade mygoing away before clearing my conscience, as if I hadcommitted some sin against deity.12"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"Socrates, from Thomas Stanley’s History of Philosophy(1687)Furthermore, we learn that Socrates considered this to be a form of“divine madness,” a gift from the gods and that gives us poetry, love,mysticism and philosophy.

AugoeidesIamblichus Chalcidensis, a Neo-Platonist philosopher and theurgistwho lived around the years 235 to 350 of the vulgar era, was greatlyconcerned with understanding the transcendent incommunicableworld, the world of gods and daemons, archons and souls. In addition to a host of gods and daemons, Iamblichus spoke of aspiritual being that he called Augoeides (αγoειδής),14 a Greek wordmeaning “of the nature of light,” or literally, “image of the dawn.” In hiswork, On the Mysteries, Iamblichus insisted that the personal daemonwas not a portion of the human mind, but an intelligence independentfrom ourselves:Afterwards, abandoning th ese particulars, you pass on tothe opinion of philosophy. But you subvert the wholehypothesis concerning the peculiar daemon. For if, [asyou say] “this daemon is a part of the soul,” such, forinstance, as the intellectual part, “and he is happy who isin possession of a wise intellect,” there will no longer beany more excellent or daemonical order, presiding over,as transcending the human soul.15"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"Iamblichus Chalcidensis, from Mussard, Historia DeorumFatidicorum (1675)Madame Blavatsky, the founder of The Theosophical Society,identified Augoeides with the imperishable aspect of the human soul,which she in turn identified with the Atma-Buddhi, .16 However,Blavatsky’s definition does not admit to an independent existence forthe Augoeides, but rather as a form of what she called the “higherself.” Hence, it differs widely from the conception of Socrates,Iamblichus, and that of Thelema.

The footnote reads as follows:Aγoειδής—a word favored by the mystical Platonists,Σαιρα ψυχης αυγoειδης, oταν μητε εκτεινηται επι τι μητεεσω συντρεχη, μητε συνιξανη, αλλα ωτι λαμτηται, τηναλληθειαν oρα την παντων, και τη εν αυτη.—Marc. Ant.,Lib. 2. The sense of which beautiful sentence of the oldphilosophy, which, as Bayle well observes, in his article onCornelius Agrippa, the modern Quietists have (howeverimpotently) sought to imitate, is to the effect that “thesphere of the soul is luminous, when nothing exte rnalhas contact with the soul itself; but when lit by its ownlight, it sees the t ruth of all things and the truth centeredin itself.”18The Greek text in this footnote by Bulwer Lytton is attributed to TheMeditations of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.19 The quotation in Zanonierroneously attributes it to Liber II of The Meditations. It is actuallyfound in Liber XI of that work.20 Yet, an even greater error lies in thefact that Marcus Aurelius did not use the word Aγoειδής at all; in TheMeditations, the word is actually Aτoειδής, which means “well-formed” or “truly shaped.” 21 In the conceptions of Iamblichus, we do find sympathy with our owndoctrines concerning the Holy Guardian Angel. However, we must notimagine that the Neo-Platonists had a developed doctrine of theAugoeides that is identical to that which we now hold. Ours is a muchlater development. Aleister Crowley, seeking to find acceptable termsfor this concept, would come to adopt the word αγoειδής and use itas a synonym of that Angel."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"HinduismGoing back a bit further, in the Hindu system we encounter the termĀtman, . It is considered to be one’s True Self beyond thatwhich may be identified with the world of phenomenon and existence.In the Hindu system of advaita, , which equates to monism, theindividual Soul is considered identical to the Universal Soul ofBrahman, . In other words, Ātman is One with the individual andwith Brahman. In the school of dvaita, , or dualism, a distinction ismade between the individual Ātman and the Universal Ātman, whichis called paramātman, . Within this point of view, there is adistinct perception of subject and the object, “I and Thou,” as beingseparate from one another.Ātman, in either school, is not the equivalent to the Holy GuardianAngel. It is the equivalent to the highest part of the human Soul thatwe call the Yechidah, , which is the “spark of Godhead”attributed to Kether.22 It equates to Hadit, our secret center which wesymbolize by the Egyptian emblem of the wingèd globe. However, itis not the Holy Guardian Angel. Consider the samādhi, , or trance state which the Hindus callĀtmadarśana, , which we may define as the “apprehension”of the Universe as a single phenomenon beyond time, space, andcausality. In this trance, the All is manifested as the One; each part ofthe Universe is experienced as the Whole. With this experience, onecertainly approaches some conception of that which is obtained byone who has attained to the Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel. However, one must remember that all trance statesare what Crowley called “isolated experiences sharply cut off from thenormal thought-life.”23 The result of a Trance state is not the samethi ng as that which is the catalyst for that Trance state, andĀtmadarśana does not require such an interaction as that which wedescribe in the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy GuardianAngel. Also, Crowley considered Ātmadarśana to be a lessersamadhi than Śivadarśana, .24 The best definition that mysticsgive of Śivadarśana is that it is a state wherein the experience ofĀtmadarśana is annihilated.Regardless of which point of view one takes, the view of monism orthe view of dualism, neither of these satisfies our most general"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"the view of dualism, neither of these satisfies our most generaldefinition.

Ut is breath (prâna), for by means ofbreath a man rises (uttishthati). Gî is speech, forspeeches are called girah. Tha is food, for by means offood all subsists (sthita). Ut is heaven, gî the sky, tha theearth. Ut is the sun, gî the air, tha the fire. Ut is the Sâma-veda, gî the Yagur-veda, tha the Rig-veda. Speech yieldsthe milk, which is the milk of speech itself, to him whothus knowing meditates on those syllables of the name ofudgîtha, he becomes rich in food and able to eat food.28For Crowley, the descriptions of the syllable UT resonated assymbols of the Holy Guardian Angel. He certainly must have identifiedprāa with Ruach, hence Tiphereth. Heaven and the Sun likewisesuggested this analogy. His enthusiasm was such that he composeda poem titled UT, which when published in The Winged Beetle, wasdedicated to his magical mentor Allan Bennett:Hail to the golden One"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"Seen in the midst of the midmost Sun! Hail to the golden beard and golden lips,Hail to the whole life golden to the finger-tips! Hail to the golden hair in golden showersHiding the eyes like bl ue blue lotus-flowers! His name is Ut, for HeHath risen above all things that be.29It must be said, however , that Crowley’s interpretation suggests anintrinsic meaning in the Hindu doctrine which is simply non-existent.Ud () is a particle and prefix to verbs and nouns. Following therules of Sanskrit grammar, if treated as an independent word, it wouldrequire the spelling , ut, for words in isolation cannot be writtenwith an ultimate consonant “d” in Sanskrit.30 The problem with UT istwofold. First, it is not an actual word. It is a prefix. Secondly, otherthan the somewhat mystical interpretation given to the syllables of theword udgītha in the Chāndogya Upanishad, it makes no doctrinalappearance anywhere in the Hindu Scriptures.31 Those verses musthave made quite an impression on Aleister Crowley the young mystic,for he continued to refer to the term late into his life. Yet, we must beaware that any meaning applied by Crowley was strictly aninterpretive meaning, and not a meaning inherent in Hindu doctrine.Ancient Egyptian ReligionIn the religion of ancient Egypt, the priests were at great pains toattempt to understand the character of the human soul, and itsrelationship with the gods, both here and in the afterlife. TheEgyp tians considered the spiritual body of man not just a singlething, but comprised of a number of unique entities, each possessingspecial characteristics.One of these, a very prominent one, was called the Ba, (b3),32which we may reasonably equate to what we think of when we useour term, “the Soul.” The word for Ba was written in hieroglyphics with"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"our term, “the Soul.” The word for Ba was written in hieroglyphics withthe image of t he a stork (believed to be the Ephippiorhynchussenegalensis).

It hadthe ability to visit the tomb of the deceased, re-animatethe body, andconverse with it. Yet, the Ba should not be considered as having onlya post-mortem presence; it was considered to exist throughouthuman life as an important aspect of the individual. Egyptologist HansGoedicke considered the Ba to demonstrate two aspects: one,introverted as the inner self, the other extroverted as the manifestedself.35 This is particularly in evidence in an example of the pessimisticliterature from the Middle Kingdom, Berlin Papyrus 3024, which w astranslated by R. O. Faulker under the name, The Man Who WasTired of Life.36 In this text, a man depressed with his life contemplatessuicide; his Ba appears and argues against this action, urging theman to embrace his life and to wait patiently for death to comenaturally, saying, “then we will make an abode together.”37 Despitethis example of objective perception, the Ba was nevertheless alwaysconsidered a subjective component of human existence."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"The b3 (Ba)Another component of the human soul was called Shuyet, (šwyt),which means the “Shadow” or “Shade.” It corresponds closely to theGreek σκιά in the sense of the shadow as one’s double.38 TheShadow was closely associated with the Ka in the afterlife andpossessed immortal characteristics. It could suffer the pains ofdamnation along with the Ba and the body if the individual to whomthe Shadow belonged was condemned as a sinner. 39 In WesternReligion there is not really an aspect of human spirituality thatcorresponds to the Egyptian idea of the Shadow. In some ways, it issimilar to what we refer to as “a ghost.” That is perhaps the closestapproximation that can be made in English.The šwyt (Shadow)A most important aspect of the Egyptian concept of the soul wascalled Ib (ib), which means “heart.”40 Again, in the WesternTradition, there really is no direct correspondence to the Egyptianterm.

A. WallisBudge. Modern Egyptologists transliterate the word as “Akh,”because it is now known that this is the closest approximation to theactual phonetic spelling of the hieroglyphs.

TheEgyptian mode of thought and Theology was not that of a Westernpriest or theologian, and was utterly unique in many ways. Generallyspeaking, it was structured along lines that correspond more easilywith conceptions of the Eastern schools rather than those of theWest. Within the doctrines of the ancient Egyptian religions, there isreally no direct counterpart to what we call the Holy Guardian Angel.However, beginning students should not get confused by thisstatement. Those who have read Initiation in the Aeon of the Childcarefully may recall I directly associated the Ka with the HolyGuardian Angel.We have incorporated a great many terms from the ancient Egyptianreligion and merged them within t he matrix of our own System, bymeans of our own understanding of them, and by reason of making"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"means of our own understanding of them, and by reason of makingthem live within the framework of our own methodology.

It was there that he encountered the concept of a SpiritualGuide or Teacher that was commonly called the “Higher DivineGenius” or the “Higher Self.” This was the preferred name used byMacGregor Mathers and other members of the Golden Dawn, despitethe fact that Mathers was the translator of The Book of the SacredMagic of Abramelin the Mage. The Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn taught this:Behind Yechidah are Angelic and Archangelic forces ofwhich Yechidah is the manifestor. It is therefore the LowerGenius or Viceroy of the Higher Genius which is beyond,an Angel Mighty and Terrible. This Great Angel is theHigher Genius, beyond which are the Archangelic andDivine.47Aspirants to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn swore to aspireto the Higher Genius with Divine Permission. In the first place, thevery notion that Spiritual Aspiration would require permission isabsolute anathema to Thelemites. In the second place, we reject theteaching that the “Higher Genius” equates to the Holy GuardianAngel. Yet, we find that Crowley initially used the phrase “HigherGenius” as well. However, he quickly changed course and ceased touse it. He did this because he was able to clearly see the dangerinherent in this terminology and therefore abandoned it.T he danger is this: the Ego of an aspirant loves to identify with thephrases: “Higher Divine Genius” or “Higher Divine Self.” The Egorather autonomously embraces such self-gratifying words as: Higher,not lower; Divine, not human; Genius; Higher Divine Genius. Yetremember: I, Me, Mine are the false Trinity, the three-fold lie.The Four Sources of InstructionThat being said, we begin our journey toward some understanding ofwhat We really mean when we speak of the Holy Guardian Angel."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"There are four sources that I will use to expound this Great Mystery.These four sources are all valuable to me, but let me hasten to addthat they are not all equal in that value. Some a re more trustworthythan others.First, there is the information that passed to those of us in the AA through a direct link to Aleister Crowley himself. This informationpassed from Crowley to his successor Karl Johannes Germer, who inturn passed it on to his disciple Marcelo Ramos Motta, who in turnbequeathed it to us.Secondly, there are the writings of Aleister Crowley through hisgeneral works or works in Class B—works of ordinary scholarship,enlightened and earnest. For instance, Crowley’s commentary toLiber LXV is a good example, as is Magick in Theory and Practice.Thirdly, there is my own direct experience with the Holy GuardianAngel. This is an intensely intimate and personal source of dataconcerning the nature of that Angel. Lastly, there are the words of The Holy Books in Class A, which arenot to be changed so much as the style of a letter. These must beclearly distinguished from the writings of Crowley himself, for they aredivinely inspired, and perfect in every way. The primary example forus pertaining to this subject would of course be Liber LXV, the Bookof the Heart Girt with the Serpent, for it is the book that expounds themystery of the Holy Guardian Angel.All of these sources are all useful, but some are more valuable thanothers. In order to establish a rank of importance we may use theformula of Tetragrammaton, the four-lettered Name of God toclarify this.Let us begin with , Heh Final of Tetragrammaton, attributed to , Malkuth, on the Tree of Life. This Sephira is the most “distant,” in amanner of speaking, from the Crown of , Kether, the first Sephiraon the Tree. To this letter, we will attribute the information that wereceived directly from an unbroken connection to Aleister Crowleywithin the AA Although this source has been invaluable to me inmy life, it is nevertheless two generations away from Crowley himself.To reach me, it has passed through two disciples, Karl Germer andMarcelo Motta.

We do our very best to relay that information asprecisely as we can to our students, yet we understand the nature ofincarnation and the tendency that order has to drift toward chaos. Wevalue it, but we are cautious, wary of any corruption that may havecrept into the chain of data.Next, is the letter , Vau of Tetragrammaton. To it will be attributed thescholastic writings of Crowley himself. Remember that the Class Bbooks are works of normal scholarship, enlightened and earnest, butnot divinely inspired. This is the nature of Vau, attributed to ,Tiphereth, on the Tree of Life, the center of the reasoning faculties,which we call the , Ruach. Because Crowley was a High Adept,we give serious consideration to his writings at this level and weighthem carefully and prayerfully. Yet, we know that they are potentiallyfallible because Tiphereth is below the Abyss, and the Reason isimperfect and capricious. Crowley himself knew this perfectly well.Some of the confounding things he wrote about the Holy GuardianAngel he would later dispute himself.To the initial , Heh of , I will attribute my own direct personalexperience. To me personally, this is the closest that I can get to thesource itself. The letter is attributed to , Binah, the ThirdSephira on the Tree of Life. It is also attributed to , Neshamah,that is the Intuition, the inspiration that is above the Abyss and thusnot contaminated by consciousness. For me, this is my closestpersonal link to the creative source. This is also true of each aspirantto this Mystery.That leaves the , Yod, the initial letter of the Tetragrammaton, thecreative fire of the Father, , Chokmah, the second Sephira on theTree of Life which we relate to the Divine Word.

Whatever The Holy Books states about the Holy GuardianAngel is the absolute Truth, regardless of what Aleister Crowleythought about it, or what Charles Stansfeld Jones thought about it, orwhat Karl Johannes Germer thought about it, or what Marcelo RamosMotta thought about it, or what I think about it.My task, as an aspirant and teacher of the Great Work, is to take"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"My task, as an aspirant and teacher of the Great Work, is to takethose Sacred Words into my Heart, and let them live in me, withoutpolluting them or defiling them with my own personal prejudices.

He stated in Magick With out Tears whyhe decided on using the phrase, “The Holy Guardian Angel” for hismission, which was teaching mankind the Next Step in its evolution.When I first set myself to put a name to my “mission”—thecontemplation carried me half-way across South-WestChina—I considered these alternatives. I thought to cutthe Gordian Knot, and call it by Abramelin’s title the “HolyGuardian Angel” because (I mused) that will be asintelligible to the villagers of Pu Peng as to the mostlearned Pundits; moreover, the implied theory was socrude that no one need be bound by it.48What Crowley meant was that one name is as good as the other,because none of them have any intrinsic meaning other than being ameans whereby we try to communicate something of this ineffablemystery. He could have chosen the word “Ka” as easily as“Augoeides,” or “Adonai,” or any other. But he chose “Holy GuardianAngel.” He had a revelation that his task was to teach mankind how toattain to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy GuardianAngel.Now this raises a most important question that we must ask: Doeseveryone have a Holy Guardian Angel?In my travels around the world giving lectures and presentations Ihave met many individuals who proclaim themselves to be aspirantsto the Great Work. I have heard groups of people talking amongthemselves about the Holy Guardian Angel. It isnot uncommon tohear them say “my Angel this” or “my Angel that.” They all seemassured that they have a Holy Guardian Angel. Once, I met a niceyoung man who took me aside at a lecture to inquire about how hemight go about joining the A A. The first thing he told me was that"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"might go about joining the A A. The first thing he told me was thathis Holy Guardian Angel was a Scandinavian Dwarf. Telesphoros, from a Gallo-Roman statue found insouthern FranceHearing this declaration was a bit of a surprise, but it did not shockme. In the first place, I knew immediately that this person did not haveKnowledge of or Conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel. If hehad, he would have no need to ask me how to find the AA. I wasalso not shocked by his belief that his Angel was a ScandinavianDwarf. I recognized in his description one of the Archetypes of theCollective Unconscious, which in one form we find represented by theKabiri (κάβειρoι).49The Kabiri were a group of obscure deities that appear in Greekmythology.50 They are generally considered to originally be ofPhrygian origin where they served as protectors of sailors. They arefound depicted as little hooded Gnomes or Dwarves, sometimesplaced on the seashore in order to protect navigation.

A well-known example in Greek mythologyis Tελεσóρoς, Telesphoros, the son of Asclepius. He represented“recovery from illness,” and his name means “bringer of completion.”Two Dwarfs, from Völuspá by Lorenz Frlich (1895)The image of the dwarf is typically an aspect of the Child Archetype,one that is still close to the Unconscious, wise or crafty andmysterious, but oddly undeveloped.

Thesinister dwarf Rumplestiltskin threatens to take the child of the Queenunless she guess his name within three days. Another example is inthe original Grimm’s Brothers fairy tale of Snow White and Red Rosewhere the dwarf is a thief and sorcerer who turned the King’s son intoa bear in order to steal his treasure.The dwarf image still springs spontaneously from the CollectiveUnconscious. It may take on the positive characteristics of one likeTelesphoros, or the Seven Dwarfs of the original Grimm’s Fairy Tale.Or he may possess the sinister, unpredictable nature of aRumplestiltskin. Alternately, he can take on the role of one who bringswisdom or treasure. This is the nature of the Archetype.Now, the nice young man with his account of a Scandinavian Dwarfmay have experienced an Archetype, but he had not experienced theHoly Guardian Angel. Most likely, he read some passages inCrowley’s Commentary to The Book of the Law and becameconfused.Throughout his life, Crowley wrestled with the difficult task of trying tounderstand the nature of the Holy Guardian Angel and in turn, explainit. He was at times more lucid on the subject than at other times.During the period of his life that I call “TheCefalù Period,” when hewas in Italy at the Abbey of Thelema (1920–1923 e.v.), he began towrite about the Angel as an aspect of Hoor-paar-kraat, the “dwarfsoul,” “our secret self” or the sex instinct. Here is a prime example:"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"The evil dwarf, from Schneeweißchen und Rosenrot (19thcentury)Hoor-paar-kraat or Harpocrates, the “Babe in the Egg ofBlue,” is not merely the God of Silence in a conventionalsense. He represents the Higher Self, the Holy GuardianAngel. The connection is with the symbolism of the Dwarfin Mythology. He contains everything in Himself, but isunmanifested.51Crowley went on to say that, “the ‘Small Person’ of Hindu mysticism,the Dwarf insane or crafty of many legends in many lands, is also thissame ‘Holy Ghost,’ or Silent Self of a man, or his Holy GuardianAngel.”52While all of these words are true of the Holy Guardian Angel in a veryspecific, Archetypal way, they are prone to be completelymisunderstood and misinterpreted. In this particular phase ofCrowley’s life, he tended to be verbose in the extreme, and lesscautious about the potential for misunderstanding these great"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"cautious about the potential for misunderstanding these greatmysteries. This was likely a result of his intense drug use at that time,which has been well-documented by himself and others.In addition to drug use, there were other extenuating circumstances inCrowley’s life during this period that should be considered whentrying to comprehend his varying descriptions of the Holy GuardianAngel. First and foremost was the fact that Crowley was experiencingthe trance of nerodha-samāpatti,53 the Opening of the Grade ofIpsissimus, which consists in the Mystery of Selflessness.54 Secondly,and doubtless of great consequence, was the intense weight of griefand sorrow he had experienced with the death of his daughter, hisunborn son, and his beloved disciple Raoul Loveday. 55 These eventswould certainly have had serious influences upon his quest todescribe the Angel.Those who are conversant with the details of Crowley’s life will alsorecall that at the Abbey of Thelema he led Frank Bennett to anepiphany as a result of something he said pertaining to the HolyGuardian Angel. It changed Bennett’s life. In his autobiography,Crowley describes this event, but he did not say precisely what hetold Bennett that day.56 However, we know from the Magical Recordsof Frank Bennett exactly what Crowley told him that fateful day."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"Frank BennettCrowley told him that Initiation was essentially a process of bringingthe “subconscious” into consciousness. He told Bennett that the“subconscious” was to all intents and purposes the Holy GuardianAngel. Furthermore, he told him the sex instinct was of primaryimportance to the “subconscious” since the sex organs were inessence the physical symbol of God in man and the nearest thing wehave to the Holy Guardian Angel.57 The suppression of the sexinstinct was in effect a suppression of the Holy Guardian Angel.58I have described this event specifically because it is vitally importantthat students not be confused by this language. In the first place,following the example of analytical psychology, we no longer use theword “subconscious.” This is a misleading word that suggestssomething that is “below consciousness.” The word “subconscious”was rejected by the analytical schools, who embraced the moreneutral term “Unconscious.” From the analytical perspective, a thingis either Conscious or it is not, and is Unconscious. “Belowconsciousness” has no more intrinsic meaning than “Above"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"consciousness” has no more intrinsic meaning than “Aboveconsciousness,” and both are misleading, implying mentalis locae orordo psychica.59 “Subconscious” was not only commonly used in thevernacular of Crowley’s time, but still occurs to this day in the samemanner.More importantly, Crowley was Frank Bennett’s Magical Instructor,and he kn ew something about Bennett’s psyche. He knew FrankBennett was suffering from sexual repression, and fighting a guil tcomplex over his desire to set his sexual instinct free. As his HolyGuru, Crowley gave Bennett a gift that set him free from his sexualrestriction. From that day on, Bennett was a changed man. He brokethe shackles of his sexual repression that had haunted him for solong. Not only did he become a IX° O.T.O., he also attained to theGrade of 6° = 5 Adeptus Major in the AA.I personally believe that Crowley told Bennett these things, eventhough he knew them to be only True in the most general waypossible. He even knew them to be essentially false, yet used thesewords as a magical weapon to help Frank Bennett. He was theMagus, wielding falsehood, that he might set one man free.As support of this view, in Chapter VII of The Equinox of the Gods,Crowley completely dismissed the idea that Aiwaz, the Holy GuardianAngel, was his “subconscious.” Referring to the words of The Bookof the Law, Crowley said,Of course I wrote them, ink on paper, in the materialsense; but they are not My words, unless Aiwaz be takento be no more than my subconscious self, or some part ofit: in that case, my conscious self being ignorant of theTruth in the Book and hostile to most of the ethics andphilosophy of the Book, Aiwaz is a severely suppressedpart of me. If so, the theorist must suggest a reason forthis explosive yet ceremonially controlled manifestation,and furnish an explanation of the dovetailing of Events insubsequent years with His word written and published.60In a footnote to this passage, Crowley added that the suggestion thatAiwaz be no more than his “subconscious self” would further implythat Crowley was, unknown to himself, “possessed of all sorts ofpraeternatural knowledge and power.” He then added that Sir W."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"praeternatural knowledge and power.” He then added that Sir W.Hamilton’s law of Parsimony of Thought appeared in rebuttal to thisidea. This is now normally referred to as “Ockham’s razor,” or theprinciple of parsimony, which states that among competinghypotheses, the hypothesis with the fewest assumptions should beselected. It is clear from this passage, written during the Cefalù periodthat Crowley had already begun to move toward modes of expressionmore harmonious with his later writing in Magick Without Tears.Lest there be any confusion, let me make this point clearly: The HolyGuardian Angel is not your Unconscious. The Holy Guardian Angel isnot your sex instinct. The Holy Guardian Angel is not your “HigherDivine Genius” or your “Higher Self” or your “Inner Guru.” In his later years, Crowley would write on this subject with shiningclarity, and he makes his point with unwavering firmness. When anew pupil made a reference using the phrase “Higher Self,” Crowleywas at pains to set the record straight for her. This is particularlyevident from his writings in Magick Without Tears:We may readily concur that the Augoeides, the “Genius”of Socrates, and the “Holy Guardian Angel” of Abramelinthe Mage, are identical. But we cannot include this“Higher Self”; for the Angel is an actual Individual with hisown Universe, exactly as a man is...He is not a mere abstraction, a selection from, andexaltation of, one’s own favorite qualities, as the “HigherSelf” seems to be... B ut this is totally different from the“Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy GuardianAngel,” which is the special aim of the Adeptus Minor.It is ruin to that Work if one deceives oneself by mistakingone’s own “energized enthusiasm” for externalcommunication. The parallel on the physi cal plane is thedifference between Onanism and Sexual Intercourse. 61It is absolutely clear that here Crowley is unequivocal in his statementconcerning the Angel. It stands in seeming odds to what he wrote inhis Commentaries to The Book of the Law. That is really notsurprising, if we read what Crowley himself later wrote about hisCommentary in a letter to Professor E. M. Butler, the author of TheMyth of the Magus. This letter is dated April 1, 1946, the year before"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Myth of the Magus. This letter is dated April 1, 1946, the year beforeCrowley’s death.Some 25 years ago I wrote a Commentary on The Bookof the Law—over a quarter of a million words of the mostturgid and incomprehensible hogwash ever penned... Ihave never been able to face the MS since it was typed. 62Crowley was not fond of his C ommentary on The Book of the Law,as witnessed by this letter. This is one of the reasons why Crowley’sown writings on the subject (and my own for that matter) wereattributed to Vau of Tetragrammaton, or next to last in reliability. Hewrote things he would l ater come to dispute, as he increased inWisdom, and in closeness to his Angel. Readers can see this forthemselves.But let us forget for a moment about what Aleister Crowley thoughtabout it, or what J. Daniel Gunther thinks about it, and examine theYOD of Tetragrammaton—the number one Source, the Class A Texts.What do The Holy Books tell us about the Holy Guardian Angel? Isthe Angel a part of the human mind? Or conversely, is the Angel aunique entity? The simple an swer is found in Liber VII, Ch apter 7,verses 13 and 14. There, the Initiate Frater Perdurabo is speaking tohis Holy Guardian Angel:I await Th ee in sleeping, in waking. I invoke Thee nomore; for Thou art in me, O Thou who hast made me abeautiful instrument tuned to Thy rapture.Yet art Thou ever apart, even as I.The message is absolutely clear: the Angel is a unique being,separate from each of us. Yet, He is wedded to those who haveachieved the Knowledge and Conversation. Each of us in thatrelationship of Adept and Angel, are unique and separate.63 Does everyone have a Holy Guardian Angel?Since Crowley called the Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel the Next Step for Mankind, does it not seemappropriate that every human being would therefore have an HolyGuardian Angel?Doesn’t everyone have a Holy Guardian Angel?"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"Your Postman?Your next door neighbor?

Intuition is the soul’s power of knowing God.To know what religion is really all about, one must knowGod.64That wonderful statement does sound like someone who knows hisHoly Guardian Angel. But does everyone have a Holy GuardianAngel? It is a simple question after all. I have asked this questionduring lectures around the world over the past few years. Most peopleanswered by saying, “Yes, of course everyone has a Holy GuardianAngel!” Or, “I always thought that everybody has a Holy GuardianAngel.”For these people, the possibility of not having a Holy Guardian Angelseems to be such a desolate idea that it cannot be imagined.Yet, if we stop and examine this carefully, the correct answer isreadily apparent. Did Adolph Hitler have a Holy Guardian Angel?Indeed, he was under the shadow of the wings, but they were thewings of a Nazi regime that committed unspeakable crimes againsthumanity. The deaths of over six million Jews is the horrendoushallmark of his life.Should we believe that evil men like Joseph Stalin and Osama BinLaden have a Holy Guardian Angel? If we look upon the evil thatthese men have wrought in the world, we must ask: does the Angelstand with those who bring death and destruction to innocents? Is itpossible to believe that every single person on the Earth has a HolyGuardian Angel?No."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"The Holy Guardian Angel is not a “good fairy” that everybody is bornwith, some nebulous ‘spirit’ that we all have that watches out for us,whispering celestial wisdom into our ears.

Y et, everyone doeshave the potential to know the Holy Guardian Angel, if they preparethemselves to be a suitable Temple for the Lord. It is the Next Stepfor humankind; but all must ready themselves for that step.There is a tradition that is taught in the A A, passed down from theProphet himself. That tradition is this: if aspirants to the Great Workprove themselves worthy, they may be recognized by a SpiritualTeacher, a Praetor-human Instructor who voluntarily takes charge oftheir training, and becomes their True Instructor. That SpiritualTeacher is the Holy Guardian Angel. This does not just necessarilyapply to aspirants within the A A.No one knows the Name of his brother or sister’s god, nor the Ritethat Invokes Him.Knowledge of the AngelThe imperative for any aspirant to AA is to discover how to attain tothe Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.Note that we first speak of the “Knowledge” of the Angel. We come toknow the presence of the Angel long before we are granted thatsacred Conversation. Furthermore, normally we come to know thepresence of that Angel gradually, as we work to prepare our Templefor God to indwell it, and as we enflame ourselves in prayer. As thisKnowledge increases, and grows from an intuitive feeling of“presence” to a certainty, we will begin to feel the need to know theName of the Angel whose company is becoming more and moresubstantial. At this point we will receive a Name whereby the Angelmay be addressed and summoned.This Name will almost certainly not be the actual Name of the Angel,but it will provide us with a vital and significant means of contact.There will be something in that Name that will be very important; aclue to the Nature of the Angel, and to the Nature of our soul. This isconsistent with what analytical psychology recognizes as theperception of an anticipatory image. The Jungian analyst Andreas"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"perception of an anticipatory image. The Jungian analyst AndreasSchweizer noted that psychologists know that new psychic contentcan be intimated in the form of anticipatory images long before theactual content penetrates into the conscious awareness of theindividual.65Eventually, as we increasingly enflame ourselves in prayer, the Angelwill reveal His True Name to us. When this occurs, we will then beready and able to engage in the Conversation with the Angel.The Union will then begin to take on a deeper, more intimatecharacter. The Angel will grad ually begin to reveal to us our PureWill. One should not expect this revelation to come as a lightningstrike. It may take some time before we are capable of perceiving therevealed Truth. This is due to the imperfection of our vehicle, which isin the process of transformation.The Adeptus Minor must be patient in order to reach a more completeunion and attain to the Conversation of the Angel, by which term wemean, Union with God.In Archetypal te rms, in relation to our Angel, we are always the VirginBride, and the Angel is the Bridegroom. We are Heh Final of theTetragrammaton, Malkuth the Daughter, whose suitor is Vau ofTetragrammaton, Tiphereth the Son. Regardless of whether we areincarnated as a man or a woman, in this relationship the aspirant isthe Bride and the Angel will appear as the Bridegroom. The HolyGuardian Angel is beyond sex altogether.Indeed, this work of A (Augoeides) requires the adept toassume the woman’s part; to long for the bridegroom,maybe, and to be ever ready to receive his kiss; but not topursue openly and use force.66The structure of this relationship seems to adhere to an Archetypalpattern. One example may be found in The Zohar in describing someof the attributes of , Shekinah, the Divine Presence, a s ynonymof Adonai.67 Shekinah is called The Redeeming Angel, using theterminology found in Genesis 48:16,68 and the Guardian Angel,referring to Exodus 23:20,Behold, I am sending an angel before you to guard you onthe way and to bring you to the place I have made ready.69"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"The Zohar gives a fairly extensive commentary to these verses,defining and elaborating on the working of Shekinah in this context.As the Redeeming Angel to Malkuth, Shekinah manifests as male; asthe superintendent on the Pillar of Severity (i.e. Binah), Shekinah isperceived as female:(This angel) is the deliverer (i.e. Redeemer) of the world,the protector of mankind, and the one who procuresblessings for all the world, he himself receiving them first .This angel is sometimes male, sometimes female. Whenhe procures blessings for the world, he is male,resembling the male who provides blessings for thefemale. But when he comes to bring chastisement on theworld he is called female, being, as it were, pregnant withthe judgement. Similarly, in the words, “the flame of thesword which turned every way” (Gen. 3,24), there is are ference to the angels who are God’s messengers, andwho turn themselves into different shapes, beingsometimes female and sometimes male, sometimesmessengers of judgement and sometimes of mercy.70The Angel comes from above the Abyss, from the Oneness of Ketherthrough the Path of Gimel. The Angel is beyond our world of dualitywhere the divisions of Unity are our way of life. He is a Praetor-human intelligence, and regardless of whether or not that Angel wasa female in an earthly incarnation at some time in the past, the Angelwill manifest in Tiphereth as the Bridegroom. From our perspective,this Union is cloaked in the garments of Archetypes, and this is how itpresents.The Kiss of the AngelOur first interactions with the Angel are subtle. Most of us will tell youthat we were so dense at that time, we were only able to see laterthat we had been in the presence of the Angel. However, eventuallythere will be an interaction with the Angel that is unmistakable. Whilestill rudimentary, compared to the later relationship we are capable ofenjoying, it is nevertheless a soul-stirring experience. These firstexperiences are generally brief. We call these precious moments “akiss from the Angel.”"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"In that wonderful little story “The Wake World,” the Virgin Bride iscalled “Lola Daydream,” and she tells us about her Bridegroom, theFairy Prince:His mouth is redder than any roses you ever saw. I wakeup quite when we kiss each other, and there is no moredream any more. But when it is not trembling on mine, Isee kisses on his lips, a s if he were kissing some onethat one could not see.71Gradually, as such brief encounters with the Angel are assimilated, achange begins to occur within us. Even as the single string of amusical instrument will begin to vibrate in harmony with a neighboringstring, so will we begin to undergo a subtle change. The HolyGuardian Angel tells us in Liber LXV:Even as evil kisses corrupt the blood, so do my wordsdevour the spirit of man. I breathe, and there is infinitedis-ease in the spirit. As an acid eats into steel, as acancer that utterly corrupts the body; so am I unto thespirit of man. I shall not rest until I have dissolved it all.72This is the beginning of the process that will eventually place theDaughter Malkuth upon the Throne of the Mother Binah on the Pathof the Great Return. The secret of the transformation of , Malkah,the inferior queen and Bride of Microprosopus, lies in becomingwholly virgin unto the Lord. This has nothing whatsoever to do withsexual chastity. It is simply one-pointedness in the Work. Everythought, every deed, every element of our lives must becomededicated, in some way to the One Purpose. The Nephesh, theanimal Soul referred also to Malkuth, therefore becomes readied forUnion with the Lord. The Bride is then duly prepared to join unto theBridegroom, the Holy Guardian Angel.Union with GodCrowley taught that we are all the Bride, and for us to at last achievethat holiest of Unions, the consummation of our marriage with theBridegroom, our task was to work to make ourselves ready; to yearnfor the kiss of the Lord, but not to strive too eagerly for it.73When a gentleman meets a lady who is the love of his life, he must"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"When a gentleman meets a lady who is the love of his life, he mustfirst make his presence known to the woman of his desires.

Yet,with all of his desire for her, as a gentleman, he must wait on her Will.She must invite him to her bed. He waits on her, and when she is ready and is aflame with desire forhim, she will invite him to her bed. In some way, with a quietexpression of love, or with a loving glance or caress, or withpassionate fervor, she will invite him to her bed. Then, and only then,does he have leave to unite with her.In this little analogy, the Holy Guardian Angel is the gentleman, theBridegroom. The Adept is the lady, the Bride.If you aspire to union with the Holy Guardian Angel, you must inviteHim to the wedding bed. When you truly summon the Angel with apure heart, enflamed with prayer, and the perfume of your orisonfilling the air, the Angel will come.The Angel will probably not manifest visibly in your temple. Theappearance of the Angel is normally far more subtle than that. But itcan happen. To this, I can attest. Do not let anyone ever tell you thatthe Angel does not possess objective reality.Normally however, we perceive the Angel through the transpersonalaspect of our psyche which Carl Jung called The self. The self istranspersonal—not personal—and is connected with the CollectiveUnconscious. It is the image-making faculty of the psyche, wherebywe experience the images of the Collective, that help us reach astage of an integrated psyche. But the self of Jung is not the HolyGuardian Angel. It is however the gate of the psyche through whichwe may first encounter the Angel. This is “self” with a lower-case “s.”The word Self written with an upper case “S” is the Angel.What do The Holy Books say about this? In Liber LXV, chapter 1, theAngel calls himself “the Image of an Image.” And in chapter 3 of LiberLXV, the An gel is called, “O Self of myself.” Throughout Liber LXV,there are a number of words used in reference to the Angel. He iscalled “Adonai,” “my darling,” “my beautiful,” “Lord,” “Holy One,”“Beloved,” “lover.” There are a number of others names and epithets"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"“Beloved,” “lover.” There are a number of others names and epithetsthat I could mention, but one that has special significance, and this is“my God.”Several years ago, a dear friend of mine who is an advanced Initiatesaid something to me that I will never forget. He said , “When I firstbegan this work, I thought that God and the Holy Guardian Angelwere not the same. Now, I can’t tell the difference anymore.”Amen.The Mystery of the Secret Name One of the greatest mysteries that we experience with the Knowledgeand Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is the revelation of theSecret Name that the Angel communicates unto us. In the words ofLola Daydream,Now you must know my Fairy Prince is my lover, and oneday he will come for good and ride away with me andmarry me. I shan’t tell you his name because it is toobeautiful. It is a great secret between us.74The great secret of that Name is intrinsically bound up with the aim ofsetting the Daughter, that is ourselves, upon the Throne of the GreatMother. This is the final confirmation of the great marriage betweenourselves and the Angel that is first celebrated in Tiphereth. In thetradition of the marriage, the Bride receives the Name of theBridegroom. That Name is the Secret Name, and in some way, it willbecome our Motto when we successfully cross the Abyss and attainto the Grade of Master of the Temple. Thus, Aleister Crowley asFrater Christeos Luciftias received the Secret Name of his AngelV.V.V.V.V. He t ook that name as his Motto, after another fashion,upon his reception in the City of the Pyramids .75 For this reason, it isa mistake to read the Holy Books and assume that every reference toV.V.V.V.V. indicates Aleister Crowley. Most references refer to theMaster, the sleepless One whose Eye is never closed and whosevoice is as the sound of many waters.the really important thing is the wake-up person. There isonly one, for there never could be any one like him.76Dominus Deus noster Dominus unus est."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"A Final WordAt the outset of this discourse, I stated that I would not attempt todescribe the Nature of the Holy Guardian Angel. While we may learnmuch from the accounts of those who went before us, the realteacher in this matter is direct experience. There is no substitute forthat. We can guide you, offer you suggestions about how to prepareyourself, and help you understand your experience. The AA haspublished an Official Ritual that offers instruction in one method. Youwill find it in Equinox IV, Number 1. It is called Liber VIII.Or you may prefer the method of The Sacred Magic of Abramelin theMage, or that shown in Liber Samekh, or a Ritual of your owndevising. No one can o r should suggest the method whereby youseek to find your God. But you must make yourself worthy of thepresence of the Lord.Don’t assume you already have a Holy Guardian Angel. Humbleyourself before the Lord. Strive to be worthy of the Holy GuardianAngel. For those of you whose aspiration is true, who desire not toserve yourselves, but to dedicate your life to the service of mankind, Iknow there is a still, small voice already whispering in your ear.Listen!I know that the Holy Guardian Angel walked with me when I knew itnot, long before I had the wisdom to sit down and be silent, to humblemyself and wait upon the Lord. Liber LXV, chapter 2 says: Nay, Lord! but I am come to Thee . It is I that wait at last.The prophet cried against the mountain; come thou hither,that I may speak with thee!The mountain stirred not. Therefore went the prophet untothe mountain, and spake unto it. But the feet of theprophet were weary, and the mountain heard not hisvoice.But I have called unto Thee, and I have journeyed untoThee, and it availed me not.I waited patiently, and Thou wast with me from thebeginning.77"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"Very often now, in the twilight of my years, as I rise in the morning, Iwill take a brief moment to reflect on my life, and I will quietly say tomyself, “See where thine Angel hath led thee.”I know that it is the Holy Guardian Angel that guides me, and directsmy Path. It is the Angel that has taught me almost everything I know,and continues to teach me every day.Take the time to be silent and listen for that still, small voice. If youlive in a city, go into the country and find a quiet, secluded place.Sit down and be still. Listen for the voice of the Silence. It may havesomething important to tell you. The most important thing you everhear may come on the wings of the Silence. It just might change yourlife.Then look about you, take stock of where you are, where you havebeen, and where you want to go.

Haines, 1916).20 This is likely a common error by the typesetter, who read the Arabic numeral 11 as Roman numeralII.21 The actual quotation from Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, Liber XI, Verse 12 is, Σαρα ψυχς ατoειδής, ταν μήτε κτείνηται πί τι μήτε σω συντρέχ, μήτε σπείρηται μήτε συνιξαν, λλ ωτλάμτηται, τν λλήθειαν ρ τν πάντων, κα τν ν ατ. “The soul is a ‘sphere truly shaped’when it neither projects itself towards anything outside nor shrinks together inwardly, neither expandsnor contracts, but irridates a light whereby it sees the reality of all things and the reality that is initself.” (Haines, The Communings with Himself of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, pp. 302–303.) It isuncertain how th e error with ατoειδής crept into Zanoni. The editions of Xylander, Casaubon,Gataker, Collier, Graves, Schultz, McCormac, and Long were compared and none were found tocontain the error. It’s origin seems to lie at the feet of Bulwer Lytton, but those who continue to quoteit in ape-like fashion perpetuate it needlessly. This is an excellent example of the need to check theactual sources of all quotations.22 means literally, “Only one.” 23 Crowley, Magick Without Tears, Chapter XII, “The Left Hand Path–The ‘Black Brothers’ “.24 Crowley, Book IV, p. 42.25 Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit English Dictionary, p. 187.26 Literally, “Veda of chants.” Ibid, p. 1205.

It cannot, forexample, end in ‘d’ and if it does have to end in that consonant (at the end of a sentence), it willchange to its unvoiced related consonant, ‘t.’ Thus, in such a context, ‘upaniśad’ would be written as‘upaniat.’ (As you know, Sanskrit faithfully records in writing every phonetic change that wordsundergo in a sentence).” (Personal e-mail to the author, Feb. 9, 2013)31 In Magick Without Tears (Chapter XLII, “This Self Introversion”) Crowley would inexplicablydescribe Ut as one “who looms so large in the Upanishads.” (p. 192).32 Cf. Coptic . See Černý, Coptic Etymological Dictionary, p. 20.33 The ideogram of the incense vapors as a component of writing B3 is consistent with the Archetypalperception of the human soul.

DANIEL GUNTHERIn 1904, The Book of the Law (Liber AL vel Legis) declared theadvent of a new period in the course of human history—the Aeon ofHorus or Aeon of the Child. The doctrine codified in the Book of theLaw, and numerous other Holy Books, is known as Thelema (a Greekword meaning “Will”). Aleister Crowley was revealed as the Prophetof the New Aeon.In this ground-breaking book, author J. Daniel Gunther provides apenetrating and cohesive analysis of the spiritual doctrine underlyingand informing the Aeon of the Child, and the sublime formulas ofInitiation encountered by those who would probe its Mysteries.Drawing on more than thirty years of direct experience as a studentand teacher within the Order of the AA, the author examines thedoctrinal thread of Thelema in its historical, religious and practicalcontext. He also provides detailed discussions and expositions ofmany of the cryptic passages within the Holy Books of Thelema.Much of Thelemic doctrine is presented here for the first time in clear,precise language that will aid those students who seek to navigatethe difficult terrain of the Spiritual quest.
