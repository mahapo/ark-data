It is theend of a two-hour flight from Lyons in the south of France. In the cabin, the stewardessinforms the passengers that it’s 6.00 p.m. in Hungary’s capital city and that the localtemperature is 8°C. Seated beside the window in the front row of business class, his seatbelt still fastened, a man in a black T-shirt looks up and stares at some invisible pointbeyond the plastic wall in front of him. Unaware of the other passengers’ curious looks,and keeping his eyes fixed on the same spot, he raises the forefinger and middle fingerof his right hand as though in blessing and remains still for a moment.After the plane stops, he gets up to take his bag from the overhead locker. He isdressed entirely in black–canvas boots, jeans and T-shirt. (Someone once remarked that,were it not for the wicked gleam in his eye, he could be mistaken for a priest.) A smalldetail on his woollen jacket, which is also black, tells the other passengers–at leastthose who are French–that their fellow traveller is no ordinary mortal, since on his lapelis a tiny gold pin embossed in red, a little larger than a computer chip, indicating tothose around him that he is a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. This is the mostcoveted of French decorations, created in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte and granted onlyat the personal wish of the President of the Republic. The award, which was given to thetraveller at the behest of Jacques Chirac, is not, however, the only thing that marks himout. His thinning, close-cropped white hair ends in a tuft above the nape of his neck, asmall white ponytail some 10 centimetres long. This is a sikha, the lock of hair worn byBrahmans, orthodox Hindus and Hare Krishna monks. His neat white moustache andgoatee beard are the final touch on a lean, strong, tanned face. At 1.69 metres he’s fairlyshort, but muscular and with not an ounce of fat on his body.With his rucksack on his back and dying for a cigarette, he joins the queue ofpassengers in the airport corridor, with an unlit, Brazilian-made Galaxy Light betweenhis lips. In his hand is a lighter ready to be flicked on as soon as it’s allowed, which willnot, it seems, be soon. Even for someone with no Hungarian, the meaning of the words‘Tilos adohanyzas’ is clear, since it appears on signs everywhere, alongside the imageof a lighted cigarette with a red line running through it. Standing beside the baggagecarousel, the man in black looks anxiously over at the glass wall separatinginternational passengers from the main concourse. His black case with a white heartchalked on it is, in fact, small enough for him to have taken it on board as hand luggage,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"but its owner hates carrying anything.After going through customs and passing beyond the glass wall, the man in black isvisibly upset to find that his name does not appear on any of the boards held up by thedrivers and tour reps waiting for passengers on his flight. Worse still, there are nophotographers, reporters or television cameras waiting for him. There is no one. Hewalks out on to the pavement, looking around, and even before lifting the collar of hisjacket against the cold wind sweeping across Budapest, he lights his cigarette andconsumes almost half of it in one puff. The other Air France passengers go theirseparate ways in buses, taxis and private cars, leaving the pavement deserted. Theman’s disappointment gives way to anger. He lights another cigarette, makes aninternational call on his mobile phone and complains in Portuguese and in a slightlynasal voice: ‘There’s no one waiting for me in Budapest! Yes! That’s what I said!’ Herepeats this, hammering each word into the head of the person at the other end: ‘That’sright–there’s no one waiting for me here in Budapest. No one. I said no one!’He rings off without saying goodbye, stubs out his cigarette and starts to smoke athird, pacing disconsolately up and down. Fifteen interminable minutes afterdisembarking he hears a familiar sound. He turns towards it, and his eyes light up. Anenormous smile appears on his face. The reason for his joy is only a few metres away: acrowd of reporters, photographers, cameramen and paparazzi are running towards himcalling his name, nearly all of them holding a microphone and a recorder. Behind themis a still larger group–his fans.‘Mister Cole-ro! Mister Paulo Cole-ro!’This is how Hungarians pronounce the surname of the Brazilian author PauloCoelho, the man in black who has just arrived in Budapest as guest of honour at theInternational Book Festival. The invitation was a Russian initiative, rather than aBrazilian one (Brazil doesn’t even have a stand), Russia being the guest country at the2005 festival. Coelho is the most widely read author in Russia, which, with 143 millioninhabitants, is one of the most populous countries in the world. Along with the reporterscome people bearing copies of his most recent success, The Zahir, all open at the titlepage, as they step over the tangle of cables on the ground and face the hostility of thejournalists, simply to get his autograph. The flashbulbs and the bluish glow from thereflectors cast a strange light on the shaven head of the author, who looks as if he wereon the strobe-lit dance floor of a 1970s disco. Despite the crowd and the discomfort, hewears a permanent, angelic smile and, even though he’s drowning in a welter ofquestions in English, French and Hungarian, he appears to be savouring anincomparable pleasure: world fame. He is in his element. Mister Cole-ro with hissparkling eyes and the sincerest possible smile is once again Paulo Coelho, superstarand a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, whose books have been translatedinto 66 languages and dialects across 160 countries. He is a man accustomed toreceiving a pop star’s welcome from his readers. He tells the journalists that he has"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"been to Hungary only once, more than twenty years before. ‘I’m just afraid that fifteenyears of capitalist tourism may have done Budapest more harm than the Russians did inhalf a century,’ he says provocatively, referring to the period when the country was partof the former Soviet Union.That same day, the author had another opportunity to savour public recognition.While waiting for the plane at Lyons airport he was approached by a fellow Brazilian,who told him that he had read and admired his work. On being called to take the bus tothe plane, they walked together to the gate, but the other Brazilian, when asked toproduce his boarding pass, couldn’t find it. Anxious that the other passengers wouldgrow impatient as the man searched clumsily through his things, the Air Franceemployee moved him to one side, and the queue moved on.Out of kindness, Paulo Coelho stood beside his fellow countryman, but was told:‘Really, you don’t need to wait. I’ll find it in a minute.’All the other passengers were now seated in the bus, and the Air France employeewas threatening to close the door. ‘I’m sorry, but if you haven’t got a boarding pass, youcan’t board the plane.’The Brazilian began to see his holiday plans falling apart, but he wasn’t going togive up that easily. ‘But I know I’ve got it. Only a few minutes ago I showed it to theauthor Paulo Coelho, who was with me, because I wanted to know if we were going tobe sitting next to each other.’The Frenchman stared at him. ‘Paulo Coelho? Do you mean that man is PauloCoelho?’ On being assured that this was so, he ran over to the bus, where the passengerswere waiting for the problem to be resolved, and shouted, ‘Monsieur Paulo Coelho! ’Once the author had stood up and confirmed that he had indeed seen his fellowBrazilian’s boarding pass, the Frenchman, suddenly all politeness and cordiality,beckoned to the cause of the hold-up and allowed him to board the bus.Night has fallen in Budapest when a tall, thin young man announces that there areto be no more photos or questions. To the protests of both journalists and fans, PauloCoelho is now seated in the back of a Mercedes, its age and impressive size suggestingthat it may once have carried Hungary’s Communist leaders. Also in the car are the menwho are to be his companions for the next three days: the driver and bodyguard, PalSzabados, a very tall young man with a crew cut; and Gergely Huszti, who freed himfrom the reporters’ clutches and who is to be his guide. Both men were appointed by theauthor’s publisher in Hungary, Athenäum.When the car sets off, and even before Gergely has introduced himself, Paulo asksfor a moment’s silence and, as he did in the plane, he gazes into the distance, raises hisforefinger and middle finger, and for a few seconds prays. He performs this solitaryceremony at least three times a day–when he wakes, at six in the evening and atmidnight–and repeats it in planes when taking off and landing and in cars when drivingoff, regardless of whether he is on a long-haul flight or a short trip in a cab."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"On the way to the hotel, Gergely reads out the planned programme: a debatefollowed by a signing session at the book festival; a visit to the Budapest undergroundwith the prefect, Gabor Demszky; five individual interviews for various televisionprogrammes and major publications; a press conference; a photo shoot with Miss Peru,one of his readers (who is in Hungary for the Miss Universe contest); two dinners; ashow at an open-air disco...Coelho interrupts Gergely in English. ‘Stop there, please. You can cut out the visitto the underground, the show and Miss Peru. None of that was on the programme.’The guide insists: ‘I think we should at least keep the visit to the underground, asit’s the third oldest in the world...And the prefect’s wife is a fan of yours and has readall your books.’‘Forget it. I’ll sign a book especially for her, but I’m not going to the underground.’With the underground, the disco and Miss Peru scrapped, the author approves theschedule, showing no signs of fatigue in spite of the fact that he has had an exhaustingweek. With the launch of The Zahir he has given interviews to reporters from theChilean newspaper El Mercurio, the French magazine Paris Match, the Dutch daily DeTelegraaf, the magazine produced by Maison Cartier, the Polish newspaper Fakt and theNorwegian women’s magazine Kvinner og Klær. At the request of a friend, an aide tothe Saudi royal family, he also gave a long statement to Nigel Dudley and SarahMacInnes from the magazine Think, a British business publication.Half an hour after leaving the airport, the Mercedes stops in front of the Gellert, animposing four-star establishment on the banks of the Danube, one of the oldest spahotels in Central Europe. Before signing in, Paulo embraces a beautiful dark-hairedwoman who has just arrived from Barcelona and has been waiting for him in the hotellobby. Holding her hand is a chubby, blue-eyed little boy. She is Mônica Antunes andthe boy is her son. Although she acts as Paulo Coelho’s literary agent, it would be amistake to consider her, as people often do, as merely that, because it accounts for onlya small part of the work she has been doing since the end of the 1980s.Some people in the literary jet set say that behind her beautiful face, soft voice andshy smile lies a ferocious guard dog, for she is known and feared for the ruthlessnesswith which she treats anyone who threatens her author’s interests. Many publishersrefer to her–behind her back of course–as ‘the witch of Barcelona’, a reference to thecity where she lives and from where she controls everything to do with the professionallife of her one client. Mônica has become the link between the author and the publishingworld. Anything and everything to do with his literary work has to pass through themodern, seventh-storey office that is home to Sant Jordi Asociados, named in Catalanafter the patron saint of books, St George.While her Peruvian nanny keeps an eye on her son in the hotel lobby, Mônica sitsdown with the author at a corner table and opens her briefcase, full of computerprintouts produced by Sant Jordi. Today, it’s all good news: in three weeks The Zahir"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"has sold 106,000 copies in Hungary. In Italy, over the same period, the figure was420,000. In the Italian best-seller lists the book has even overtaken the memoirs of therecently deceased John Paul II. The author, however, doesn’t appear to be pleased.‘That’s all very well, Mônica, but I want to know how The Zahir has done incomparison with the previous book in the same period.’She produces another document. ‘In the same period, Eleven Minutes sold 328,000copies in Italy. So The Zahir is selling almost 30 per cent more. Now are you happy?’‘Yes, of course. And what about Germany?’‘There The Zahir is in second place on Der Spiegel’s best-seller list, after The DaVinci Code.’As well as Hungary, Italy and Germany, the author asks for information about salesin Russia and wants to know whether Arash Hejazi, his Iranian publisher, has resolvedthe problems of censorship, and what is happening regarding pirate copies being sold inEgypt. According to Mônica’s figures, the author is beating his own records in everycountry where the book has come out. A week after its launch in France, The Zahirtopped all lists, including the most prized, that of the weekly news magazine L’Express.In Russia, sales have passed the 530,000 mark, while in Portugal, they stand at 130,000(whereas Eleven Minutes had sold only 80,000 copies six months after its launch). InBrazil, The Zahir has sold 160,000 copies in less than a month (60 per cent more thanEleven Minutes in the same period). And while Coelho is appearing in Hungary,500,000 copies of the Spanish translation of The Zahir are being distributed throughoutthe southern states of America–to reach the Spanish-speaking communities there–andthroughout eighteen Latin-American countries. The only surprise is the last piece ofnews: the previous day, an armed gang stopped a lorry in a Buenos Aires suburb andstole the entire precious cargo–2,000 copies of The Zahir that had just left the printer’sand were on their way to bookshops in the city. Some days later, a literary critic in theDiario de Navarra in Spain suggested that the robbery had been a publicity stuntdreamed up by the author as a way of selling more copies.All this stress and anxiety is repeated every two years, each time Paulo Coelhopublishes a new book. On these occasions, he shows himself to be as insecure as anovice. This has always been the case. When he wrote his first book, O Diário de umMago [The Pilgrimage], he shared the task of distributing publicity leaflets outsideRio’s theatres and cinemas with his partner, the artist Christina Oiticica, and then wentround the bookshops to find out how many copies they had sold. After twenty years, hismethods and strategies may have changed, but he has not: wherever he is, be it in Tierradel Fuego or Greenland, in Alaska or Australia, he uses his mobile phone or his laptopto keep abreast of everything to do with publication, distribution, media attention andwhere his books are on the best-seller lists.He has still not yet filled out the inevitable hotel form or gone up to his room, whenLea arrives. A pleasant woman in her fifties, married to the Swiss Minister of the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Interior, she is a devoted reader of Coelho’s books, having first met him at the WorldEconomic Forum in Davos. When she learned that he was visiting Budapest, Lea tookthe train from Geneva, travelling over 4,000 kilometres through Switzerland, Austriaand half of Hungary in order to spend a few hours in Budapest with her idol. It is almosteight o’clock when Coelho finally goes up to the suite reserved for him at the Gellert.The room seems palatial in comparison with his modest luggage, the contents ofwhich never vary: four black T-shirts, four pairs of coloured silk boxer shorts, five pairsof socks, a pair of black Levi’s, a pair of denim Bermudas and a pack of Galaxycigarettes (his stock of the latter is regularly topped up by his office in Rio or by kindvisitors from Brazil). For formal occasions he adds to his luggage the coat he waswearing when he flew in from France, a shirt with a collar, a tie and his ‘society shoes’–a pair of cowboy boots–again all in black. Contrary to what one might think on firstseeing him, his choice of colour has nothing to do with luck, mysticism or spirituality.As someone who often spends two-thirds of the year away from home, he has learnedthat black clothes are more resistant to the effects of hotel laundries, although on mostoccasions he washes his own socks, shirts and underpants. In one corner of his case is asmall wash bag containing toothbrush and toothpaste, a razor, dental floss, eau decologne, shaving foam and a tube of Psorex, a cream he uses for the psoriasis hesometimes gets between his fingers and on his elbows. In another corner, wrapped insocks and underpants, are a small image of Nhá Chica, a holy woman from MinasGerais in Brazil, and a small bottle of holy water from Lourdes.Half an hour later, he returns to the hotel lobby freshly shaved and smelling oflavender, and looking as refreshed as if he has just woken from a good night’s sleep; hisovercoat, slung over his shoulders, allows a glimpse of a small blue butterfly with openwings tattooed on his left forearm. His last engagement for the day is dinner at thehome of an artist in the Buda hills above the city on the right bank of the Danube, with awonderful view of the old capital, on which, this evening, a fine drizzle is falling.In a candlelit room some fifty people are waiting for him, among them artists,writers and diplomats, mostly young people in their thirties. And, as usual, there are alot of women. Everyone is sitting around on sofas or on the floor, talking or, rather,trying to talk above the noise of heavy rock blasting out from loudspeakers. A circle ofpeople gathers round the author, who is talking non-stop. They soon become aware oftwo curious habits: every now and then, he makes a gesture with his right hand as ifbrushing away an invisible fly from in front of his eyes. Minutes later, he makes thesame gesture, but this time the invisible fly appears to be buzzing next to his right ear.At dinner, he thanks everyone in fluent English for their kindness and goes on to praiseHungarian cooks, who can transform a modest beef stew into an unforgettable delicacy–goulash. At two in the morning, after coffee and a few rounds of Tokaji wine, everyoneleaves.At a quarter to ten the following morning, the first journalists invited to the press"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"conference have already taken their places on the thirty upholstered chairs in the HotelGellert’s small meeting room. Anyone arriving punctually at ten will have to stand. Theperson the reporters are interested in woke at 8.30. Had it not been raining he wouldhave taken his usual hour-long morning walk. Since he dislikes room service (‘Onlysick people eat in their bedrooms’), he has breakfasted in the hotel’s coffee bar, goneback to his room to take a shower, and is now reading newspapers and surfing theInternet. He usually reads a Rio newspaper and one from São Paulo, as well as the Parisedition of the International Herald Tribune. The remainder of his daily reading willarrive later in the form of cuttings and synopses focusing on the author and his books.At exactly ten o’clock he enters the room, which is lit by reflectors and full ofjournalists, and sits down behind the small table provided, on which stand a bottle ofmineral water, a glass, an ashtray and a vase of red roses. His guide, Gergely, takes themicrophone, explains the reason for the author’s visit to the country and announces thepresence in the front row of his agent, Mônica Antunes. She stands shyly andacknowledges the applause.Coelho speaks in English for forty minutes, which includes the time it takes forGergely to translate each sentence into Hungarian. He recalls his visit to Budapest in1982, and talks a little about his personal life and his career as a writer. He reveals, forexample, that, following the success of The Pilgrimage, the number of pilgrims toSantiago de Compostela rose from 400 a year to 400 a day. In recognition of this, theGalician government has named one of the streets of Santiago ‘Rua Paulo Coelho’.When the meeting is opened up for questions, it becomes clear that the journalistspresent are fans of his work. Some mention a particular book as ‘my favourite’. Themeeting passes without any indiscreet or hostile questions being asked; the friendlyatmosphere is more like a gathering of the Budapest branch of his fan club. WhenGergely brings the meeting to an end, the reporters reward the author with a round ofapplause. A small queue forms in front of the table and an improvised signing sessionexclusive to Hungarian journalists begins. Only then does it become apparent thatnearly all of them have copies of his books in their bags.The writer, who rarely lunches, has a quick snack in the hotel restaurant–toast withliver pâté, a glass of orange juice and an espresso. He makes use of a free half-hourbefore his next appointment to glance at the international news in Le Monde and ElPaís. He’s always interested in what’s going on in the world and he’s always wellinformed about any wars and crises that hit the headlines. It’s quite usual to hear himspeaking confidently (but without ever appearing to be dictatorial or superior) onmatters as various as the growing crisis in Lebanon or the nationalization of oil and gasin Bolivia. He publicly defended the exchange of hostages held by Marxist guerrillas inColombia for political prisoners being held by the Colombian government, and hisprotest letter in 2003 entitled ‘Thank you, President Bush’, in which he castigated theAmerican leader for the imminent invasion of Iraq, was read by 400 million people and"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"caused much debate.Once he has read the newspapers, he gets back to work. Now it is time for MarsiAniko, the presenter of RTL Club’s Fokusz2, which regularly tops the Sunday eveningratings. The unusual thing about Fokusz2 is that, at the end of each programme, theinterviewee is given a Hungarian dish prepared by Marsi Aniko herself. In a small,improvised studio in the hotel, the face-to-face interview again holds no surprises, apartfrom the way she blushes when a cheerful Coelho decides to start talking aboutpenetrative sex. At the end, he receives a kiss on each cheek, a tray of almásrétes–atraditional Hungarian tart filled with poppy petals that Aniko swears she has made withher own fair hand–and a bottle of Pálinka, a very strong local brandy. Within minutes,the set has been removed to make way for another jollier, more colourful one, for aninterview with András Simon from Hungarian MTV. An hour later, once the recordingis over, the journalist hands the author a stack of seven books to sign.With a few minutes’ break between each interview–time enough for the author todrink an espresso and smoke a cigarette–these interviews continue into the lateafternoon. When the last reporter leaves the hotel, it is dark.Coelho declares that he is not in the least tired. ‘On the contrary. Talking about somany different things in such a short space of time only increases the adrenalin. I’mjust getting warmed up...’Whether it is professionalism, vanity or some other source of energy, the fact isthat the author, who is about to turn sixty, is on enviably good form. A shower andanother espresso are all it takes for him to reappear at 8.30 in the hotel lobby, gleefullyrubbing his hands. Mônica, Lea (who has managed to attach herself to the group), thesilent bodyguard Szabados and Gergely are waiting for him. There is one moreengagement before the end of the day: a dinner with writers, publishers and journalistsat the home of Tamás Kolosi, who owns the publishing house Athenäum and is one ofthe people behind Coelho’s visit to Hungary. When Gergely asks Coelho if he’s tiredafter all the day’s activities, the author roars with laughter.‘Certainly not! Today was just the aperitif. The real work begins tomorrow.’After dinner with the publisher, Mônica uses the ten minutes in the car journeyback to the hotel to tell him what she has organized with Gergely for the following day.‘The opening of the book festival is at two in the afternoon. You’ve got interviewsat the hotel in the morning, so there’ll be no time for lunch, but I’ve booked a restauranton the way to the book festival so that we can grab a sandwich and some salad.’Coelho’s mind is elsewhere. ‘I’m worried about the Israeli publisher. He doesn’tlike the title The Zahir and wants to change it. Call him tomorrow, will you, and tellhim I won’t allow it. Either he keeps the title or he doesn’t get to publish the book. Itwas bad enough them changing the name of the shepherd Santiago in The Pilgrimage toJakobi.’He was equally stubborn before he became famous. Mônica recalls that the US"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"publisher of The Alchemist wanted to re-name it The Shepherd and His Dreams, but theauthor refused to sanction the change.Listening to her now, he says, smiling: ‘I was a complete nobody and they wereHarperCollins, but I stuck to my guns and said “No way,” and they respected me forthat.’The following morning it is sunny enough to encourage the author to take his usualhour-long walk–this time along the banks of the Danube. Then after a shower, a quickglance at the Internet, breakfast and two interviews, he’s ready for the second part of theday: the opening of the book festival. On the way there, they stop at the place reservedby Mônica, a snack bar, where all the other customers seem to have been driven awayby the incredibly loud music coming from an ancient jukebox.Coelho walks over, turns down the volume, puts 200 florins into the machine andselects a 1950s hit, ‘Love Me Tender’ by Elvis. He goes back to the table smiling as heimitates the rock star’s melodious tones: ‘“Love me tender, love me true...” I adore theBeatles, but this man is the greatest and will be around for ever...’Gergely wants to know why he’s so happy, and Coelho flings wide his arms.‘Today is the feast of St George, the patron saint of books. Everything’s going to bejust fine!’The International Book Festival in Budapest takes place every year at a conventioncentre located in a park–which, today, is still powdered with winter snow–and brings inhundreds of thousands of visitors. Coelho is welcomed at a private entrance by threeburly bodyguards and ushered into the VIP lounge. When he learns that there are almostfive hundred people waiting at the publisher’s stand to have their books signed, he says:‘We said that only 150 vouchers were to be handed out.’The manager of the publishing house explains that they have no means of gettingrid of the readers and fans. ‘I’m sorry, but when the vouchers ran out, the other peoplein the queue simply refused to leave. There were even more people originally, but someof them have gone over to the auditorium where you’re due to speak. The problem isthat it only seats 350, and there are now 800 waiting to get in. We’ve had to erectscreens outside for them.’Mônica goes quietly out of the room to the Athenäum stand and returns fiveminutes later, shaking her head and looking worried. ‘It’s just not going to work. It’sgoing to be bedlam.’The security people say there’s no danger, but suggest that Mônica’s son and thenanny remain in the VIP lounge until the end of the programme.Now, however, the news that the festival is crammed with fans and readers appearsto have dispelled Coelho’s initial feelings of irritation. He gets up smiling, claps hishands and makes a decision: ‘So there are too many people? The more the merrier!Let’s go and meet the readers. Just give me five minutes alone.’He goes to the toilet as if for a pee, but once there he stands and stares into space,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"praying silently. Then he asks God to make sure that everything goes well during theday. ‘Now it’s up to You.’God appears to have listened. Protected by the three bodyguards, and by Szabados,who has orders never to let him out of his sight, Paulo Coelho arrives in the Béla Bártokroom lit by the lights of television crews and the flashlights of photographers. All theseats are taken and even the passageways, aisles and galleries are filled to capacity. Theaudience is equally divided between men and women, but most are young. He isescorted to the stage by the security guards and he acknowledges the applause, his handspressed to his chest. The harsh lights and the crush of people mean that the heat isunbearable. The author speaks for half an hour in fluent French, talking about his life,his beliefs and the struggle to realize his dream to become a writer, all of which is thentranslated into Hungarian by a young woman. After this a small number of people areselected to ask questions, at the end of which the writer stands up to thank everyone fortheir welcome.The audience doesn’t want him to leave. Waving their books in the air, they yell:‘Ne! Ne! Ne!’In the midst of the uproar, the interpreter explains that ‘ne’ means ‘no’–thosepresent do not want the author to leave without signing their books. The problem is thatthe security people are also saying ‘ne’. There are simply too many people. The cries of‘Ne! Ne! ’ continue unabated. Coelho pretends not to have understood what the securitypeople are saying, takes a pen out of his pocket and returns, smiling, to the microphone.‘If you can get yourselves in some kind of order, I’ll try and sign a few.’Dozens of people immediately start pushing forward, climbing on to the stage andsurrounding the author. Fearing a stampede, the security guards decide to step in. Theylift Coelho bodily off the floor and carry him through the curtains and from there to asecure room. He bursts out laughing.‘You could have left me there. I’m not frightened of my readers. What I fear iscreating panic. In 1998, in Zagreb, a security man with a pistol at his waist tried tobreak up the queue and you can imagine how dangerous that was! My readers wouldnever harm me.’With two bodyguards in front of him and two behind, and under the curious gaze ofonlookers, the author is accompanied down the corridors of the convention centre to theAthenäum stand, where copies of The Zahir await him. The queue of 500 people hasbecome a crowd too large to organize. The 150 voucher holders wave their numberedcards in the air, surrounded by the majority, who have only copies of Paulo Coelho’sbooks as their passport to an autograph. He is, however, used to such situations andimmediately takes command. Speaking in French with an interpreter on hand, he raiseshis arms to address the multitude–and yes, this really is a multitude: 1,500? 2,000? It’simpossible to know who is there to get his autograph or to get a glimpse of their idoland who has simply been attracted by the crowd. Finding it hard to be heard, he shouts:"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"‘Thank you for coming. I know lots of you have been here since midday and I’ve askedthe publisher to provide water for you all. We’re going to have two queues, one forthose who’ve got a voucher and the other for those who haven’t. I’m going to try to dealwith everyone. Thank you!’Now comes the hard work. While waiters circulate with trays of cold mineral water,the author tries to create some order out of the chaos. He signs thirty books for those inthe queue and then another thirty for those who have had to wait outside. Every fifty orsixty minutes he pauses briefly to go to the toilet or to a small area outside, the onlyplace in the entire conference centre where he can smoke, and which he has named ‘badboy’s corner’. On his third visit, he comes across a non-smoker, book in hand, waitingout of line for an autograph. He is Jacques Gil, a twenty-year-old Brazilian from Riowho has moved to Hungary to play for the oldest football club there, Újpest. Coelhoquickly signs the book and takes four or five drags on his cigarette. He then hurries backto the stand, where the crowd is waiting patiently.By the time the last of the fans reach the table, it is dark, and with the officialprogramme at an end, it is time to relax. The original group–with the addition of half-a-dozen young men and women who refuse to leave–agree to meet after dinner in thehotel foyer for an evening’s entertainment. At ten, everyone goes to a karaoke bar inMammut, a popular shopping centre. The young Hungarians accompanying the authorare disappointed when they learn that the sound system isn’t working.‘That’s too bad,’ one complains to the manager. ‘We managed to persuade PauloCoelho to sing for us...’The mention of Coelho’s name again opens doors, and the manager whisperssomething to a shaven-headed man, who immediately picks up a motorcycle helmetfrom the table and rushes off. The manager returns to the group, smiling. ‘There’s noway we’re going to miss a performance by Paulo Coelho just because we’ve no karaokeequipment. My partner has gone to borrow some from another club. Please, take a seat.’The motorcyclist takes so long to come back that the much-hoped-for performancebecomes what musicians might call an ‘impromptu’ and a fairly modest one at that.Coelho sings Frank Sinatra’s ‘My Way’ with Andrew, a young American student onholiday in Hungary. He follows this up with a solo version of ‘Love Me Tender’, butdeclines to give an encore.Everyone returns to the hotel at midnight, and the following morning, the membersof the group go their separate ways. Mônica returns with her son and Juana toBarcelona, Lea goes back to Switzerland, and the author, after an hour’s walk throughthe centre of Budapest, is once again sitting in the back of the Mercedes driven bySzabados. Next to him is a cardboard box full of his books. He opens one at the firstpage, signs it and hands it to Gergely, who is in the front seat. In the last two books, hewrites a personal dedication to his driver and his guide. An hour later, he is sitting inbusiness class in another Air France plane, this time bound for Paris, and again he is"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"saying his silent prayer.When the plane has taken off, a beautiful young black woman with her hairarranged in dozens of tiny plaits approaches him with a copy of The Pilgrimage inPortuguese. Her name is Patrícia and she is secretary to the famous Cape Verdeansinger Cesária Évora. She asks him to sign the book. ‘It’s not for me, it’s for Cesária,who’s sitting back there. She’s a big fan of yours, but she’s really shy.’Two hours later in Paris, at Charles de Gaulle airport, Coelho has yet another shortbut unexpected signing and photo session, when he’s recognized by a group of CapeVerdean Rastafarians who are waiting for the singer. Their excitement attracts theattention of other people, who immediately recognize the author and ask to be allowedto take some photos as well. Although he’s clearly tired, he cheerfully deals with all ofthem. At the exit, a chauffeur is waiting with a Mercedes provided by Coelho’s Frenchpublisher. Although a suite costing 1,300 euros a day has been reserved for him at theHotel Bristol, one of the most luxurious hotels in the French capital, he prefers to stayat his own place, a four-bedroom apartment in the smart 16th arrondissement with awonderful view of the Seine. The problem is getting there. Today marks the anniversaryof the massacre of the Armenians by the authorities of the Ottoman Empire, and a noisydemonstration is being held outside the Turkish Embassy, which is right near theapartment building. On the way, the Mercedes passes newspaper stands and kiosksdisplaying a full-page advertisement for Feminina, the weekly women’s supplementwith a circulation of 4 million, which is offering its readers an advance chapter fromThe Zahir. An enormous photo of the author fills the front page of the Journal duDimanche, advertising an exclusive interview with him.By dint of driving on the pavement and going the wrong way down one-way streets,Georges, the chauffeur, finally manages to park outside the apartment block. Despitehaving bought the place more than four years ago, Coelho is so unfamiliar with it thathe still hasn’t managed to learn the six-digit code needed to open the main door.Christina is upstairs waiting for him, but she has no mobile with her and, besides, hecan’t remember the phone number of the apartment. There are two alternatives: he canwait until a neighbour arrives or shout up to Christina for her to throw down the key.It’s drizzling, and the wait is becoming uncomfortable. In a six-storey building with justone apartment per floor he might have to wait hours for a Good Samaritan to come in orout. The only thing to do is to shout and hope that Christina is awake.He stands in the middle of the street and yells, ‘Chris!’No response. He tries again. ‘Christina!’He looks round, fearing that he might be recognized, and yells one more time,‘Chris-tiii-naaaaaa!’Like a mother looking down at a naughty child, she appears, smiling, in jeans andwoollen jumper, on the small balcony on the third floor and throws the bunch of keys toCoelho (who really does look tired now)."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The couple spend only one night there. The following day they are both installed insuite 722 of the Hotel Bristol. The choice of hotel is deliberate: it is a temple to luxuryin the Faubourg St Honoré and it is here that Coelho set parts of The Zahir, among theLouis XV sofas in the hotel lobby. In the book, the main character meets his wife, thejournalist Esther, in the hotel café to drink a cup of hot chocolate decorated with a sliceof crystallized orange. In recognition of this, the Bristol has decided to name the drink‘Le chocolat chaud de Paulo Coelho’ and the name is now written in gold letters on tinybars of chocolate served to guests at 10 euros a go.On this particular afternoon, the hotel has become a meeting place for journalists,celebrities and various foreign guests, all of whom have been invited to a dinner whereFlammarion will announce the scoop of the year in the European publishing world: ithas signed a contract to publish Paulo Coelho. Since 1994, the author has remainedfaithful to the small publisher Éditions Anne Carrière, which has achieved sales thathave been the envy of even the most well-established publishing houses: in a little morethan ten years it has sold 8 million copies of his books. After years of turning downever-more enticing and hard-to-refuse offers, the author has decided to give way to whatis reputed to be a 1.2 million-euro deposit in his bank account by Flammarion, althoughboth parties refuse to confirm this sum.Paulo and Christina appear in the hotel lobby. She is an attractive fifty-five-year-old, slightly shorter than Paulo, with whom she has been living since 1980. She isdiscreet and elegant, with fair skin, brown eyes and a delicate nose. On the inside of herleft arm, she bears a tattoo of a small blue butterfly identical to Paulo’s. Her glossy hairis cut just below her ears, and over her long black dress she’s wearing a bright redshawl. But it is the two rings on her fingers (‘blessed by a tribal leader’, she explains)that attract most attention. They are a gift brought by Paulo from Kazakhstan. He, asever, is dressed entirely in black–trousers, jacket, cowboy boots. The only slight changeis that he is wearing a collar and tie.The first friend to arrive is also a guest at the hotel and has come a long way. He isthe Russian journalist Dmitry Voskoboynikov, a large, good-natured man who stillbears the scars from the injuries he suffered during the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia,where he and his wife Evgenia were spending Christmas and New Year. A formerLondon correspondent for TASS and the son of a member of the KGB, he is the ownerof Interfax, a news agency with its headquarters in Moscow and which covers the worldfrom Portugal to the farthest-flung regions of eastern Asia. The four sit round one of thesmall tables in the marble lobby and Evgenia, a magnificent blonde Kazak, gives theauthor a special present–a richly bound edition of The Zahir translated into her mothertongue. Four glasses of champagne appear on the table along with crystal bowls full ofshelled pistachios. The subject changes immediately to gastronomy and Evgenia saysthat she has eaten a ‘couscous à Paulo Coelho’ in Marrakesh, and Dmitry recalls diningin a Restaurant Paulo Coelho at Gstaad. The conversation is interrupted by the arrival of"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"another well-known journalist, the Brazilian Caco Barcellos, the head of the Europeanoffices of Rede Globo de Televisão. He has arrived recently from their London office,having been sent to Paris solely to report on the Flammarion dinner. At seven in theevening, Georges arrives with the Mercedes to take Paulo and Christina to theceremony. The choice of venue for this banquet for 250 guests leaves no doubt as to theimportance of the evening: it is the restaurant Le Chalet des Îles, a mansion thatNapoleon III ordered to be dismantled and brought over from Switzerland to be rebuilt,brick by brick, on one of the islands on the lake of the Bois de Boulogne as proof of hislove for his wife, the Spanish Countess Eugenia de Montijo. The guests are checked bysecurity guards on the boat that takes them across to the Île Supérieure. Ondisembarking, they are taken by receptionists to the main door, where the directors ofFlammarion take turns greeting the new arrivals. Publishers, literary critics, artists,diplomats and well-known representatives of the arts in Europe are surrounded bypaparazzi and teams from gossip magazines wanting photos and interviews. There are atleast two ambassadors present, Sergio Amaral from Brazil and Kuansych Sultanov fromKazakhstan, where The Zahir is partly set. The only notable absentee is FrédéricBeigbeder, a former advertising executive, writer and provocative literary critic, whohas worked as a publisher at Flammarion since 2003. Some years ago, when he was acritic for the controversial French weekly Voici, he wrote a very negative review ofPaulo Coelho’s Manual of the Warrior of Light. When everyone is seated, the authorgoes from table to table, greeting the other guests. Before the first course is served,there is a short speech from Frédéric Morel, managing director of Flammarion, whodeclares the new contract with Paulo Coelho to be a matter of pride for the publisher,which has launched so many great French writers. The author appears genuinely movedand gives a short address, thanking everyone for their good wishes and saying howpleased he is that so many people have come. After dessert, champagne toasts anddancing to a live band, the evening comes to an end. The following morning an hour-long flight takes the author and Christina to Pau in the south of France. There they takethe car Coelho left in the car park some days earlier–a modest rented Renault Scénicidentical to Chris’s. His obvious lack of interest in consumer goods, even a certainstinginess, means that although he’s very rich, he didn’t own his first luxury car until2006, and even that was obtained without any money changing hands. The German car-makers Audi asked him to produce a short text–about two typed pages–to accompanytheir annual shareholders report. When asked how much he wanted for the work hejoked: ‘A car!’ He wrote the article and sent it off by e-mail. A few days later, a truckfrom Germany delivered a brand-new, gleaming black Audi Avant. When he heard thatthe car cost 100,000 euros, a Brazilian journalist worked out that the author had earned16 euros per character. ‘Not bad,’ Coelho remarked when he read this. ‘ApparentlyHemingway got paid 5 dollars a word.’Half an hour after leaving Pau, Coelho and Christina are in Tarbes, a small, rather"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"dismal town of 50,000 inhabitants on the edge of the French Basque country, a fewkilometres from the Spanish border. Four kilometres out towards the south on a near-deserted road, they finally reach their house in Saint-Martin, a tiny community of 316inhabitants and a few dozen houses set among wheatfields and pasturelands grazed byHolstein cows. The couple took the unusual decision to move here in 2001, when theymade a pilgrimage to the sanctuary in Lourdes, 16 kilometres away. There wasn’t a bedto be had in Lourdes, and they ended up staying in the Henri IV, a modest three-starhotel in Tarbes. It was the peacefulness of the region, its proximity to Lourdes and theincredible view of the Pyrenees that made them decide to settle there. While looking fora suitable house to buy and being in no hurry, Paulo and Christina spent almost twoyears in the only suite in the Henri IV, a rambling old house lacking any of the comfortsthey were accustomed to in large hotels. The absence of any luxury–which meant noInternet connection either–was more than made up for by the care lavished on them bythe owner, Madame Geneviève Phalipou, and by her son, Serge, who, depending on thetime of day, was manager, waiter or hotel porter. The so-called suite the coupleoccupied was, in fact, nothing more than a room with ensuite bath like all the others,plus a second room which served as a sitting room.During their long stay in that small town, Coelho soon became a familiar figure.Since he has never employed secretaries or assistants, he was always the one who wentto the post office, the chemist’s or the butcher’s, and shopped at the local supermarket,just like any other inhabitant. At first, he was regarded as a celebrity (particularly whenforeign journalists started hanging around outside the Henri IV), but fame counts forlittle when one is standing in the queue at the baker’s or barber’s, and within a matter ofmonths he had become a member of the Tarbes community. Even after he left the hoteland moved to his own house in Saint-Martin, the inhabitants of Tarbes continued toconsider him one of their own–a compliment that Coelho is always eager to repay. Hedemonstrated his gratitude during an interview for Tout le Monde en Parle, a liveprogramme on the French station France 2, whose presenter, Thierry Ardisson, is knownfor asking embarrassing questions. On this occasion, the singer Donovan and thedesigner Paco Rabanne were also on the programme.Ardisson went straight to the point: ‘Paulo Coelho, there’s something I’ve beenwanting to ask you for a long time. You’re rich, world-famous, and yet you live inTarbes! Isn’t that rather stupid?’The author refused to rise to the bait. He merely laughed and replied: ‘Even theinhabitants were surprised, but it was love at first sight. Love is the only explanation.’The presenter went on: ‘Be serious now. What was the real reason you chose to livein Tarbes?’‘As I said, it was love.’‘I don’t believe you. Admit it–you lost some bet and had to move to Tarbes.’‘No, I didn’t!’"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"‘Are they holding your wife hostage in order to force you to live there?’‘No, absolutely not!’‘But doesn’t anyone who lives in Tarbes have to go to Laloubère or Ibos to do theirshopping?’‘Yes, that’s where I do all my shopping.’‘And does anyone there know you and know that you’re Paulo Coelho?’‘Of course, everyone knows me.’‘Well, since you like it so much there, would you like to send a message to theinhabitant–sorry, the inhabitants–of Tarbes?’‘Absolutely. Tarbes people, I love you. Thank you for welcoming me as a son ofyour town.’This was music to the ears of his new fellow citizens. A few days later, thenewspaper La Dépêche, which covers the entire region of the Hautes-Pyrénées, praisedCoelho’s actions and stated: ‘On Saturday night, Tarbes had its moment of nationalglory.’Contrary to what one might read in the press, he doesn’t live in a castle. The couplelive in the old Moulin Jeanpoc, a disused mill that they have converted into a home. Theliving area is less than 300 square metres and is on two storeys. It’s very comfortablebut certainly not luxurious. On the ground floor are a sitting room with fireplace (besidewhich he has his work table), a small kitchen, a dining room and a toilet. Whilerenovating the place the couple had an extension added, made entirely of strengthenedglass, including the roof, where they can dine under the stars. They also converted anold barn into a comfortable studio, where Christina spends her days painting. On thefirst floor is the couple’s bedroom, a guest room and another room, where Maria deOliveira sleeps. She is the excellent cook whom Christina brought over from Brazil.The most delightful part of the house, though, is not inside but outside, where thereis a magnificent view of the Pyrenees. The view is even more beautiful betweenNovember and March, when the mountains are covered in snow. In order to enjoy thisview, the author had to buy his neighbour’s house and knock it down. He cannotremember exactly how much he paid for either his own house or the neighbour’s, butagents in the area value the house alone, without the surrounding land, at about 900,000euros. The author’s property portfolio–which includes the house in Tarbes, theapartment in Paris and another in Copacabana–was substantially increased when HisHighness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Emir of Dubai and PrimeMinister of the United Arab Emirates, gave him a fully furnished mansion worthUS$4.5 million in one of the most exclusive condominiums in Dubai. The sheikh madesimilar gifts to the German racing driver Michael Schumacher, the English mid-fielderDavid Beckham and the Brazilian footballer Pelé.Since they have no other help but Maria, not even a chauffeur, it is Coelho who isresponsible for all the routine tasks: sawing wood for the fire, tending the roses, cutting"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"the grass and sweeping up dead leaves. He is very organized and tries to keep some kindof discipline in the domestic timetable with a regime he laughingly calls ‘monasticrules’. Apart from when he is involved in the launch of a new book or attending debatesand talks around the world, his daily routine doesn’t change much. Although he’s nobohemian, he rarely goes to bed before midnight; he drinks wine in moderation andusually wakes in a good mood at about eight in the morning. He breakfasts on coffee,bread, butter and cheese, and, regardless of the weather, he goes out for an hour’s walkevery day, either in the wheat fields surrounding the house or, on a fine day, in thesteep, stony hills near by, at the foot of the Pyrenees. Christina almost always goes withhim on these walks, but if she’s away or unwell, he goes alone. Any friends who stay atthe house know that they will have to accompany their host–this is one of the monasticrules. One of his favourite walks takes him to the chapel of Notre Dame de Piétat in thecommune of Barbazan-Debat, next to Saint-Martin and Tarbes. Here he kneels, makesthe sign of the cross, says a brief prayer, puts a coin in the tin box and lights a candle infront of the small painted wooden image of the Virgin Mary holding the body of herdead son.Back at the house, Coelho does some odd jobs in the garden, deadheads the plantsand clears any weeds blocking the little stream that runs across the land. Only then doeshe go and take a shower and, afterwards, turn on his computer for the first time in theday. He reads online versions of at least two Brazilian newspapers and then takes a lookat the electronic clippings agency that picks up on anything published about him and hisbooks the previous day. Before pressing the enter key that will open up a site showingthe best-seller lists, he places his outspread hands over the screen as though warminghimself in front of a fire, closes his eyes and meditates for a moment, seeking, he says,to attract positive energy.Today, he hits the key and smiles as the screen shows that, in the countries thatmatter most, he has only been beaten to number one in Germany and Brazil. In boththese countries it is Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code that heads the list. His e-mails alsohold no great surprises. There are messages from no fewer than 111 countries, listed inalphabetical order from Andorra to Venezuela, passing through Burkina Faso, in Africa,to Niue off the coast of New Zealand and Tuvalu in Polynesia.He says to Christina, who is sitting beside him: ‘What do you make of that,Christina? When we got back from our walk it was 11.11 and the thermometer wasshowing 11°C. I’ve just opened my mailbox and there are messages from 111 countries.I wonder what that means.’It’s not uncommon to hear him say such things: while the majority of people wouldput something like that down to mere coincidence, Coelho sees such things as signs thatrequire interpretation. Like the invisible fly he’s always trying to drive away with hishand, his preoccupation with names, places, dates, colours, objects and numbers thatmight, in his view, cause problems, leads one to suspect that he suffers from a mild"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"form of obsessive compulsive disorder. Coelho never mentions Paraguay or the ex-president Fernando Collor (or his Minister of Finance, Zélia Cardoso de Mello), and hefelt able to mention the name of Adalgisa Rios, one of his three long-term partners, onlyafter her death in June 2007. Indeed, if anyone says one of the forbidden names in hispresence he immediately knocks three times on wood in order to drive away anynegative energy. He crosses the road whenever he sees a pigeon feather on thepavement, and will never tread on one. In April 2007, in an eight-page article about himin The New Yorker magazine, he candidly confessed to the reporter Dana Goodyear thathe refuses to dine at tables where thirteen people are seated. Christina not onlyunderstands this eccentric side of Coelho but shares his fears and interpretations and isoften the one to warn him of potential risks when deciding whether or not to dosomething.One afternoon a week is set aside for reading correspondence that arrives viaordinary mail. Once a week, he receives packages in the post from his Rio office andfrom Sant Jordi in Barcelona. These are stacked up on a table on the lawn and openedwith a bone-handled penknife, and the letters arranged in piles according to size. Fromtime to time, the silence is broken by a cow mooing or by the distant sound of a tractor.Any manuscripts or disks from aspiring authors go straight into the wastepaper bin,precisely as his various websites say will happen. At a time when letter bombs andenvelopes containing poisonous substances have become lethal weapons, Coelho hasbegun to fear that some madman might decide to blow him up or contaminate him, butin fact he has never yet received any suspect package. However, because of his concern,he now meditates briefly over any parcels arriving from Rio or Barcelona, even whenthey’re expected, in order to imbue them with positive vibes before they are opened.One cardboard package, the size of a shirt box, from his Rio office, contains replies toreaders’ letters that require his signature. The longer ones are printed on the officialheaded notepaper of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, of which Coelho has been amember since 2002. Shorter replies are written on postcards printed with his name. Thesession ends with the signing of 100 photos requested by readers, in which the authorappears, as usual, in black trousers, shirt and jacket.After a few telephone calls, he relaxes for an hour in an area in the garden (or in thewoods around the house), where he practises kyudo, the Japanese martial art of archery,which requires both physical strength and mental discipline. Halfway through theafternoon, he sits down in front of his computer to write the short weekly column of 120words that is published in thirty newspapers around the world, from Lebanon (Al Bayan)to South Africa (Odyssey), from Venezuela (El Nacional ) to India (The Asian Age), andfrom Brazil (O Globo) to Poland (Zwierciadlo).In other respects, the couple’s day-to-day life differs little from that of the 300other inhabitants of the village. They have a small circle of friends, none of whom areintellectuals or celebrities or likely to appear in the gossip columns. ‘I can access 500"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"television channels,’ Coelho declared years ago in an interview with the New YorkTimes, ‘but I live in a village where there’s no baker.’ There’s no baker, no bar, nosupermarket and no petrol station. As is the case in the majority of France’s 35,000communes, there isn’t a single commercial establishment in sleepy Saint-Martin. Tarbesis the nearest place for shops, as long as you get there before five in the afternoon, whenthe small town starts to shut down. Coelho’s evening programme often consists of avisit to one of the three good restaurants there.Eventually, it is time for Coelho to return to work. An e-mail from Sant Jordicontains a packed programme for the following three weeks, which, if he agrees to it,will mean a round-the-world trip. On the programme are invitations to the launch of TheZahir in Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Puerto Rico and Paris. He is also to receive theGoldene Feder prize in Hamburg, and there are signings as well in Egypt, Syria andLebanon, plus a trip to Warsaw for the birthday of Jolanda, the wife of the President ofPoland at the time, Aleksander Kwásniewski. Then on to London to take part with BorisBecker, Cat Stevens and former secretary general of the UN Boutros Boutros Ghali in afund-raising dinner for the campaign against the use of land-mines. The following dayhe will return to France for dinner with Lily Marinho, widow of Roberto Marinho, theowner of Organizações Globo. Four days later, he is supposed to attend the launch ofThe Zahir in Japan and South Korea. On his return to Europe he will stop off in Astana,the capital of Kazakhstan, for the sixty-fifth birthday of the President, NursultanNazarhayev. The last engagement on the list cannot be missed: an invitation from KlausSchwab, creator and president of the World Economic Forum held annually in Davos,for the author to speak at the opening of another of Schwab’s enterprises, the CulturalFestival in Verbier, where young classical musicians from all over the world meet.Coelho brushes away the invisible fly two or three times and mutters somethingalong the lines of: ‘No human being could possibly do all that.’Christina hears the complaint and teases him gently: ‘Look, you were the one whochose to be a Formula 1 champion, so get in your Ferrari and drive!’The remark soothes him. He laughs and agrees that not only did he make thatchoice but he fought his whole life to become what he is now, and so has no right tocomplain. ‘But I still can’t take on the whole programme. Some of the events are tooclose together and on three different continents!’Usually, the stress of travel is caused not by the engagements themselves, but bythe misery of modern air travel, especially since 9/11, when the consequent increase invigilance and bureaucracy has created even longer delays for passengers. He faces thesame queues, delays and overbookings as his millions of readers, and one of theproblems with the programme suggested by Sant Jordi is that it will have to beundertaken entirely on commercial flights. Coelho prints out the list and, pen in hand,starts by cutting out any engagements that entail intercontinental flights, which meansputting off Latin America, Japan and South Korea, and the birthday party in"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Kazakhstan. Syria and Lebanon also go, but Egypt remains. Warsaw is replaced byPrague, where he wants to fulfil a promise made twenty years earlier. Finally, hedecides that his first stop, in the Czech Republic, will be followed by Hamburg, wherehe will receive his prize and from where he will fly on to Cairo. However, the problem,once again, is flights. There are no connections that will allow him to stick to thetimetables for Germany and Egypt. The Germans refuse to change the programme,which has already been printed and distributed, but they suggest an alternative: theprivate plane of Klaus Bauer, president of the media giant Bauer Verlagsgruppe, whichsponsors the Goldene Feder prize, will take him and those in his party from Hamburg toCairo as soon as the ceremony is over.Hours later, when the programme has been agreed by all concerned, he telephonesMônica and jokes: ‘Since we’re going to Prague, what about putting on a “blitzkrieg”there?’‘Blitzkrieg’ is the name Coelho gives to book signings that take place unannouncedand with no previous publicity. He simply walks into a bookshop chosen at random,greets those present with ‘Hi, I’m Paulo Coelho’ and offers to sign copies of his booksfor anyone who wants him to. Some people say that these blitzkriegs are basically aform of exhibitionism, and that the author loves to put them on for the benefit ofjournalists. This certainly appeared to be the case when the reporter Dana Goodyear wastravelling with him in Italy, where a blitzkrieg in Milan bore all the marks of havingbeen deliberately staged for her benefit. In Prague, in fact, he is suggesting a middleway: to tell the publisher only the night before so that while there is no time forinterviews, discussions or chat shows to be set up, there is time to make sure, at least,that there are enough books for everyone should the bookshop be crowded.However, the objective of this trip to the Czech Republic has nothing to do withselling books. When he set out on the road back to Catholicism in 1982, after a period inwhich he had entirely rejected the faith and become involved in Satanic sects, Coelhowas in Prague with Christina during a long hippie-style trip across Europe. They visitedthe church of Our Lady Victorious in order to make a promise to the Infant Jesus ofPrague. For some inexplicable reason, Brazilian Christians have always shown aparticular devotion to this image of the child, which has been in Prague since theseventeenth century. The extent of this devotion can be judged by the enormous numberof notices that have been published over the years in newspapers throughout Brazil,containing a simple sentence, followed by the initial of the individual: ‘To the InfantJesus of Prague, for the grace received. D.’ Like millions of his compatriots, Coelhoalso came to make a request, and by no means a small one. He knelt at the small sidealtar where the image is displayed, said a prayer and murmured so quietly that evenChristina, who was beside him, could not hear: ‘I want to be a writer who is read andrespected worldwide.’He realized that this was quite a request, and that he would need to find a"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"comparable gift to give in return. As he was praying, he noticed the moth-eaten clothesworn by the image, which were copies of the tunic and cloak made by Princess PolicenaLoblowitz in 1620 for the first known image of the Infant Jesus of Prague. Still in awhisper, he made a promise which, at the time, seemed somewhat grandiose: ‘WhenI’m a well-known author, respected worldwide, I will return and bring with me a gold-embroidered cloak to cover your body.’Three decades later the idea of the blitzkrieg is really an excuse to revisit Pragueand repay the grace he has been granted. Made exactly to fit the image, which is abouthalf a metre high, the red velvet cloak, embroidered with fine gold thread, is the resultof weeks of work by Paula Oiticica, Christina’s mother.Packed in an acrylic box so that it can be transported safely, the gift creates a smallincident at Charles de Gaulle airport, when the police demand that the package bepassed through an X-ray machine in order to prove that it doesn’t conceal drugs orexplosives; unfortunately, it’s too big for the machine. Coelho refuses to board withoutthe cloak, while the police maintain that, if it can’t be X-rayed, it can’t travel. Asuperior officer notices the small crowd gathering, recognizes M. Coelho and resolvesthe deadlock: the cloak is taken on to the plane without being scanned.When the couple arrive at the church in Prague, some two dozen faithful are there,all apparently foreigners. Since he speaks only Czech and Italian, the Carmelite priest,Anastasio Roggero, appears not to understand quite who this person is and what he isdoing in his church holding a red cloak. He listens to what Coelho is saying to him inEnglish, smiles, thanks him and is preparing to stow the box away behind a cupboard inthe sacristy when an old French woman recognizes the author.In an inappropriately loud voice, she tells the members of her group: ‘Look, it’s thewriter Paulo Coelho!’All the tourist groups converge on him, clamouring for his autograph and to havetheir photo taken with him. Father Anastasio turns, looks again at the cloak he isholding and begins to realize his mistake. He apologizes to Coelho for not havingrecognized him or the significance of the gift the Infant Jesus has just received. Hereturns to the sacristy and comes back armed with a digital camera to take photos of thecloak, the tourists and, of course, himself with his famous visitor, whose work he claimsto know well.Once Coelho has settled his account with the Infant Child, the couple spend theirfree time revisiting the capital and seeing Leonardo Oiticica, Christina’s brother, who ismarried to Tatiana, a diplomat at the Brazilian embassy in Prague. Twonewspapers–Pravó and Komsomólskaia–have now publicized Paulo Coelho’s presencein the city, and so the intended blitzkrieg cannot be a genuinely spontaneous event. Bythree in the afternoon, an hour before the agreed time, hundreds of people are lined upoutside the Empik Megastore, the enormous modern bookshop chosen by Coelho’sCzech publisher, Argo. He arrives at the agreed hour and finds things much as they were"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"in Budapest. This time only 150 readers have managed to get vouchers, but hundreds ofpeople are filling the aisles of the shop and spilling out into Wenceslas Square. They allwant an autograph. The author does what he did in Hungary: he asks the bookshop toprovide everyone with water, and divides the waiting crowd into those with vouchersand those without. At six in the evening, he looks at his watch and asks to be allowed atoilet break. Instead, he goes behind a screen only a few metres away in order to say hissilent prayer. It’s dark by the time he has signed the last book. He ends the eveningenjoying Czech nouvelle cuisine in a smart restaurant in the old part of the city with asmall group of friends.The following day he is back in Paris for yet another signing, this time at the Fnacbookshop in the Place des Thermes. Although the shop is expecting only about ahundred people, the news has spread and about three hundred are packed into the smallauditorium. Outside, people are trying to get to the display of CDs and DVDs, part of asmall exhibition, not only of his books but also of his own literary, musical andcinematographic favourites. Among the books are Albert Camus’ The Outsider, HenryMiller’s Tropic of Cancer, Jorge Luis Borges’ Fictions, Jorge Amado’s Gabriela, Cloveand Cinnamon and the biography of the matador El Cordobés, I’ll Dress You inMourning, by Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins. The films on display includeBlade Runner (Ridley Scott), Once Upon a Time in the West (Sergio Leone), 2001: ASpace Odyssey (Stanley Kubrick), Lawrence of Arabia (David Lean) and The Promise(Anselmo Duarte), while the selection of CDs is even more eclectic: from The Beatles’Abbey Road to Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, from Pink Floyd’s Atom Heart Mother toChopin’s First Piano Concerto. The French fans are as patient as the Hungarians andCzechs. After giving a half-hour talk and answering questions, the author signs booksfor all those present before leaving the shop.In marked contrast to this relaxed atmosphere, the Goldene Feder award ceremony,the following day, is organized with almost military precision. Hamburg has been in apermanent state of alert (and tension) since the discovery that the people behind the9/11 attacks in the United States had been part of an Al Qaeda terrorist cell active there.Of the twenty men directly involved in the attack, nine lived in an apartment on theedge of the city, among them the leader of the group, the Egyptian Mohammed Atta.Judging by the number of private security guards present, the ceremony is clearlyconsidered a prime target. Bankers, industrialists, businessmen, publishers and thefamous have arrived from all corners of Europe to be here. In order to avoid anyproblems, the organizers of the event have allowed only five minutes for the press tophotograph the guests and prize-winners (prizes are also being given to a scientist, aprofessor, a businesswoman and a priest). During the presentation ceremony, thereporters, along with the security guards and chauffeurs, are relegated to a canteenwhere they can watch everything on TV monitors.Five hours later, the writer and his rucksack are in the VIP lounge at Hamburg"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"airport, ready to take a Falcon jet to Cairo. His arrival in Egypt coincides with a visit toCairo by the First Lady of the United States, Laura Bush, which means that securitymeasures are even tighter. Friends have expressed their concern for Coelho’s safety,given the frequency with which tourists in Egypt have been the victims of terroristattacks by radical Islamic groups. ‘What if some group of religious fanatics kidnappedyou and demanded the release of 100 political prisoners in exchange?’ they ask. He,however, appears unconcerned. This is not only because he has previously consulted theoracles but because he knows that during his visit he will be protected by Hebba RaoufEzzar, the woman who invited him to speak at Cairo University. This forty-year-oldMuslim mother of three, and visiting professor at Westminster University in London, isa charismatic political scientist who has overcome the prejudices of a society wedded tomachismo and has become a major influence in the battle for human rights and thepromotion of dialogue between Islam and other faiths. Being in Egypt at her invitationmeans being able to circulate freely–and safely–among a wide variety of political andreligious groups.There are other reasons, too, for Coelho to visit Egypt. The country is possibly theworld champion when it comes to producing pirate editions of his books. Even thoughalmost half the population is illiterate, it has been estimated that more than fourhundred thousand illegal copies of his books–some 5 per cent of all pirate copies of hiswork worldwide–are available here. You can find Arabic translations of everythingfrom The Pilgrimage to The Zahir in the windows of smart bookshops and on thepavements of Cairo, Alexandria and Luxor. And there are pirated editions for everypocket, from crude home-made versions to hardback editions printed on good-qualitypaper and produced by established publishers, some of them state-run. The authorreceives almost nothing in royalties from Egypt, but the real loser is the reader, whoends up buying copies either with chapters missing or in the wrong order, or that aretranslations intended for other Arab-speaking countries and not necessarilycomprehensible to Egyptians. The pirate producers enjoy total immunity fromprosecution; indeed, at the last International Book Fair in Cairo, Paulo Coelho’s workstopped the best-seller lists, as if they had been produced by publishers complying withinternationally agreed laws.Keen to put a stop to the problem, Coelho lands in Cairo, accompanied by MônicaAntunes and Ana Zendrera, the proprietor of Sirpus in Spain, which specializes inArabic publications destined for the Middle East and North Africa. Since May 2005,only two companies, All Prints in Lebanon and Sirpus, have been legally authorized topublish his books in Egypt.At the airport, which is full of soldiers carrying sub-machine guns, the three aregreeted by Hebba and her husband, the activist Ahmed Mohammed. He is dressed inWestern clothes, but she is wearing a beige hijab. They all speak English, which isEgypt’s second language. The small group goes straight to the Four Seasons Hotel,"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"where a suite has been reserved for the author on the top floor with a view of Giza at theedge of the Sahara.Hebba has drawn up a packed programme of events: interviews and TVappearances, visits to the famous (among them the Nobel Laureate Naguib Mahfouz,who is ninety and losing his sight, but determined to receive the author in his apartmentfor a cup of tea), a seminar at Cairo University and two talks, one at the EgyptianAssociation of Authors and the other at its rival, the Union of Egyptian Authors. AtPaulo’s request, Hebba has arranged a lunch in one of the dining rooms of the FourSeasons to which the principal publishers and booksellers in the country have beeninvited, along with representatives of the Ministry of Culture. It is here that the authoris hoping to ram home his point about defending the rights of the author. He tellsHebba: ‘You know perfectly well, Hebba, that when a warrior takes out his sword, hehas to use it. He can’t put it back in its sheath unbloodied.’The following morning, the lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel is invaded by TVnetwork people waiting for the interviews Mônica has organized. Cameras, tripods,reflectors, cables and batteries are stacked in corners and spread out on tables and sofas.Individual interviews are the privilege of the television reporters; newspaper andmagazine journalists have to make do with a press conference. The only exception is AlAhram, the main Egyptian newspaper–state-run as, it seems, most are–which also hasthe privilege of being first in line. Once the interview is over, the reporter, Ali Sayed,opens his briefcase and asks the author to sign three books, The Alchemist, Maktub andEleven Minutes–all of them pirate copies, bought in the street for US$7 each. In theearly afternoon, the five go to a restaurant for a quick lunch washed down with Fanta,Coca Cola, tea and mineral water. Although there is wine and beer available, the meal isgoing to be paid for by Ahmed, a Muslim, and good manners require that no alcohol bedrunk.Once the engagements with the press are over Coelho takes part in hurried debatesat the two writers’ associations. At both, the number of members of the public is two orthree times greater than the venues’ capacity and he attends kindly and good-naturedlyto the inevitable requests for signings at the end. Before returning to the hotel, he istaken to Mohamed Heikal’s apartment. Heikal is a veteran politician who started hiscareer alongside President Nasser, who governed from 1954 to 1970, and he has so farmanaged to weather the political upheavals in Egypt. Surrounded by bodyguards, Heikalreceives his visitor in a small apartment. The walls are covered in photos of him withgreat international leaders of the twentieth century, such as the Soviet leader NikitaKhrushchev, Chou En-Lai of China, Jawalarhal Nehru of India and Chancellor WillyBrandt, as well as Leonid Brezhnev and, of course, Nasser himself. Coelho’s meetingwith the Nobel Laureate Naguib Mahfouz is also subject to intense vigilance by securityguards (years ago Mahfouz narrowly escaped death at his door when he was knifed inthe neck by a Muslim fundamentalist who accused him of blaspheming against the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Koran). The two speak rapidly in English, exchange signed copies of their books andthat’s it. With the day’s agenda over, the evening is reserved for a boat trip on the Nile.The following day the morning is free, allowing Coelho to wake later than usual,take his walk without hindrance and give some time to looking at news online. At oneo’clock, he goes down to the hotel dining room for the lunch that he has suggested. Inspite of the smiles and salaams during the presentations, it is clear that the idea is to setthings to rights. Before the food is served and once all the guests are seated, one of thepublishers stands up to greet the visitor and makes a point of stating that this is ameeting of friends.‘The author Coelho has proved his commitment to the Arab peoples not only in hiswork but in brave public statements such as in his letter “Thank you, President Bush”,which clearly condemned the invasion of Iraq by the United States.’Someone else speaks, and then it is Coelho’s turn. Beside him at the table are threepirate copies of his books, deliberately placed there in order to provoke unease amongthe publishers–the elegant men in jackets and ties who are seated before him. He beginsgently, recalling that some of his books have found inspiration in both Egyptian andArabic culture. Then, face-to-face with the pirates themselves, he broaches the thornytopic of piracy, saying: ‘Any author would, of course, love to see his books published inEgypt. My problem is precisely the opposite: I have too many publishers in Egypt.’No one finds the joke funny, but he is unperturbed. He glances upwards, as if askingSt George for the strength to defend his books, and then adopts a blunter approach.He picks up a pirate copy of The Alchemist and waves it in the air. ‘I am here as aguest of Dr Hebba, that is, of the Egyptian people. But I have come here on my ownaccount as well because I want to sort out, once and for all, the problem of the piratecopies of my books being published here.’The guests shift uncomfortably in their seats. Some, embarrassed, are doodling ontheir napkins.Coelho knows full well that some are important figures in the Ministry of Culture(which has shares in many of the publishing houses he is accusing of piracy) and hemakes the most of this opportunity: ‘The government neither punishes nor condemnspiracy, but Egypt is a signatory to international treaties on royalties and must conformto them. I could get the best lawyer money can buy and win the case in internationalcourts, but I’m not here merely to defend material values, I’m defending a principle.My readers here buy books at a cheap price and get cheap editions, and it’s got to stop.’Coelho’s suggestion that they call an armistice doesn’t seem to please anyone.‘I’m not interested in the past. Let’s forget what’s happened up to now. I’m notgoing to claim royalties on the 400,000 books published in a country where I’ve nevereven had a publisher. But from now on, any book of mine published in Egypt that is notproduced by Sirpus or by All Prints will be considered illegal and therefore the subjectof legal action.’"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"To prove that he’s not bluffing, he announces that there will be a special blitzkriegin the Dar El Shorouk bookshop, next to the hotel: he will sign the first book producedunder the new regime (a pocket version of The Alchemist in Arabic with the Sirpusstamp on it) as well as copies of the English translation of The Zahir. This awkwardmeeting ends without applause and with the majority of those present looking stony-faced.Everything seems to be going as he predicted. The signing is a success and he saysto any journalist who hunts him out: ‘I think the publishers have accepted my proposal.From now on, my Egyptian readers will read my books only in official translationspublished by Sirpus.’ His confidence, however, will prove short-lived, because the onlyreal change in the situation is that now the pirates have another competitor in themarket–Sirpus.The conference at Cairo University, the following day, the last engagement of histrip to Egypt, goes smoothly. The conference takes place in a 300-seat auditorium andthere are exactly 300 people present. The majority are young women who, unlikeHebba, are wearing Western dress–tight jeans and tops revealing bare shoulders andmidriffs. After his talk, idolatry gets the better of discipline, and they crowd aroundhim, wanting him to sign copies of his books.On the way back to the hotel, Hebba suggests doing something not on the schedule.Readers belonging to the Official Paulo Coelho Fan Club in Egypt who did not manageto get to any of his public appearances want to meet him at the end of the afternoon fora chat. Cheered by what he believes to have been the success of his lunch with thepublishers, he agrees without asking for any further details. His response means thatHebba has to go off at once to mobilize the public. The place she has chosen is animprovised open-air auditorium under one of the bridges that cross the Nile. No oneknows quite what methods she has used to gather so many people together, but there isgeneral astonishment among the Brazilian contingent when they arrive and find a crowdof more than two thousand people. The venue appears to be a building that has been lefthalf-finished with concrete slabs and bits of iron still visible. The place is packed, withpeople sitting in between the seats and in the side aisles. It seems quite incredible thatso many could have been gathered together on a weekday without any priorannouncement in the newspapers, on the radio or television. There are even peopleperched on the walls and in the trees surrounding the auditorium.In the infernal heat, Hebba leads Coelho to a small dais in one corner of the area,where a coffee table and three armchairs await them. When he says his first words inEnglish–‘Good afternoon, thank you all for being here’–a hush descends. He talks forhalf an hour about his life, his struggle to become a recognized author, his drug-taking,his involvement in witchcraft, the time he spent in mental institutions, about politicalrepression and the critics, and how he finally rediscovered his faith and realized hisdream. Everyone watches him entranced, as if they were in the presence not of the"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"author of their favourite books but of someone who has lessons in life to teach them.Many are unable to hide their feelings and their eyes are filled with tears.When he says his final ‘Thank you’ Coelho is crying too. The applause looks set tocontinue, and, making no attempt to conceal his tears now, Paulo thanks the audienceagain and again, folding his arms over his chest and bowing slightly. The people remainstanding and applauding. A young girl in a dark hijab goes up on to the dais andpresents him with a bouquet of roses. Although he is quite used to such situations, theauthor appears genuinely moved and is at a loss how to react. The audience is stillapplauding. He turns rapidly, slips behind the curtains for a moment, glances upwards,makes the sign of the cross and repeats for the umpteenth time a prayer of gratitude toSt Joseph, the saint who, almost sixty years earlier, watched over his rebirth–because,but for a miracle, Paulo Coelho would have died at birth."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2ChildhoodPAULO COELHO DE SOUZA was born on a rainy night on 24 August 1947, the feast of StBartholomew, in the hospital of São José in Humaitá, a middle-class area of Rio deJaneiro. The doctors had foreseen that there might be problems with the birth, the firstfor twenty-three-year-old Lygia Araripe Coelho de Souza, married to a thirty-three-year-old engineer, Pedro Queima Coelho de Souza. The baby would be not only theirfirst child but a first grandchild for the four grandparents and a first nephew for unclesand aunts on both sides. Initial examination had shown that the child had swallowed afatal mixture of meconium–that is, his own faeces–and amniotic fluid. He was notmoving in the womb and showed no inclination to be born, and finally had to bedelivered by forceps. As Paulo was pulled into the world, at exactly 12.05 a.m., thedoctor must have heard a slight crack, like a pencil snapping. This was the baby’scollarbone, which had failed to resist the pressure of the forceps. Since the baby, a boy,was dead, this was hardly a problem.Lygia was a devout Catholic and, in a moment of despair, the first name that cameto her lips was that of the patron saint of the maternity hospital: ‘Please bring back myson! Save him, St Joseph! My baby’s life is in your hands!’The sobbing parents asked for someone to come and give the last rites to their deadchild. Only a nun could be found, but just as she was about to administer the sacrament,there was a faint mewing sound. The child was, in fact, alive, but in a deep coma. Hehad faced his first challenge and survived it.He spent his first three days in an incubator. During those decisive seventy-twohours, his father, Pedro, remained with him all the time. On the fourth day, when Paulowas taken out of the incubator, Pedro finally managed to get some sleep, and wasreplaced in his vigil by his mother-in-law, Maria Elisa or Lilisa, as she was known. Sixdecades later, Paulo would state without hesitation that his earliest memory was ofseeing a woman come into the room and knowing that she was his grandmother. In spiteof weighing only 3.33 kilos at birth and measuring 49 centimetres, the child seemedhealthy. According to Lygia’s notes in her baby album, he had dark hair, brown eyesand fair skin, and looked like his father. He was named after an uncle who had diedyoung from a heart attack.Apart from a bout of whooping cough, Paulo had a normal, healthy childhood. Ateight months, he said his first word, at ten months, his first teeth appeared and at elevenmonths, he began to walk without ever having crawled. According to Lygia, he was"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"‘gentle, obedient, extremely lively and intelligent’. When he was two, his only sister,Sônia Maria, was born; he was always fond of her and, apparently, never jealous. Atthree, he learned to make the sign of the cross, a gesture that was later accompanied byrequests to God for the good health of his parents, grandparents, cousins, uncles andaunts.Until he was thirteen, he and his family lived on an eleven-house estate built by hisfather in Botafogo, a pleasant middle-class area of Rio. The best of the houses–the onlyone with a garden–was reserved for Pedro’s in-laws, Lilisa and Tuca, who owned theland. Another of the houses, a modest, two-storey affair, was given to Pedro in paymentfor his work and the remaining nine were let, sold or occupied by relatives. The Coelhoswere so concerned about security that, although the estate was protected by high gates,all the windows and doors in the house were kept shut. Paulo and the other childrencould play freely as long as they did so within the confines of the estate; although it wasonly a few blocks from Botafogo beach, they knew nothing of life beyond its walls.Friendship with children from ‘outside’ was unthinkable.From a very young age, Paulo showed that he had an original way of thinking.When, at the age of three, Lygia caught him behaving badly, he said: ‘Do you know whyI’m being naughty today, Mama? It’s because my guardian angel isn’t working. He’sbeen working very hard and his battery has run out.’One of his greatest pleasures was helping his grandfather Tuca repair his enormousPackard car. His father felt that this was clear proof that his son would turn out to be anengineer like him. Pedro also had a car–a Vanguard–but it rarely left the garage. As faras Pedro Coelho was concerned, if the family could take the bus into the city, there wasno reason to spend money on petrol.One of Coelho’s earliest memories is of his father’s tight grip on domesticfinances. Engineer Pedro Queima Coelho de Souza’s dream was to build not just amodest house for his family, like those on the estate, but a really large house withdrawing rooms, a conservatory, verandahs and several bathrooms. The first step towardsbuilding this cathedral was a present from his father-in-law, Tuca: a 400-square-metreplot in Rua Padre Leonel Franca in the smart district of Gávea. From then on all non-essential expenditure for the family was cut in favour of the house in Gávea. ‘If we’regoing to build a house for everyone,’ declared Dr Pedro, as he was known, ‘theneveryone is going to have to cut back on spending.’ No new clothes, no birthday parties,no presents, no unnecessary trips in the car. ‘At the time,’ the author recalls, ‘we hadnothing, but we didn’t lack for anything either.’ Christmas was saved for the children bythe German electric trains and French dolls that their maternal grandparents gave them.The dream house in Gávea caused the family a further problem. Instead of placinghis savings in a bank, Pedro preferred to invest it in building materials and, since he hadno shed in which to store these treasures, he kept everything in the house until he hadenough capital to begin the construction work. As a result, both Coelho and his sister"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"recall spending their childhood among lavatory bowls, taps, bags of cement and tiles.The cutbacks did not, however, impoverish Coelho’s intellectual life. Although hisfather no longer bought any new records, he nevertheless listened to classical musicevery night. And anyone pressing his ear to the front door of No. 11 would have heardBach and Tchaikovsky being played by Lygia on the piano that had been with her sincebefore she was married. The house was also full of books, mainly collected by Lygia.At the beginning of 1952, when he was four and a half, Coelho’s parents enrolledhim in kindergarten, where he spent two years. Then, in 1954, intending eventually tosend their son to a Jesuit secondary school, St Ignatius College, his parents moved himto Our Lady Victorious School, which was seen as the best route to St Ignatius–the mosttraditional school of its kind in Rio, and one of the most respected educationalestablishments for boys in the city. St Ignatius was expensive, but it guaranteed the onething that the Coelhos regarded as essential: strict discipline.It was certainly true that, at least in Paulo’s case, the cordon sanitaire placedaround the estate to protect the children from the evil world outside had no effect. Atfive, he was already viewed by his adult neighbours as a bad influence on their children.As there were two other children on the estate called Paulo (his cousins, Paulo Arraesand Paulo Araripe), he was simply called ‘Coelho’. To Lygia and Pedro’s horror,suspicions that it was ‘Coelho’ who was responsible for many of the odd things thatwere happening in the small community began to be confirmed. First, there was thediscovery of a small girl bound hand and foot to a tree so that she appeared to behugging it and who was too afraid to tell on the culprit. Then came the information that,at dead of night, the boys were organizing chicken races, which ended with all thecompetitors, apart from the winner, having their necks wrung. One day, someonereplaced the contents of all the cans of hair lacquer belonging to the young girls on theestate with water. It was one of the victims of this last jape–Cecília Arraes, an oldercousin–who worked out who the culprit was. She found a satchel in one of the boys’hiding places containing papers that revealed the existence of a ‘secret organization’complete with statutes, the names of the leaders and the minutes of meetings. This wasthe Arco Organization, its name being taken from the first two letters of the surnamesof the chief perpetrators, Paulo Araripe and Paulo Coelho.Cecília collared the future author and said: ‘So what’s this Arco business? Whatdoes the organization do? If you don’t tell me, I’m going to your parents.’He was terrified. ‘It’s a secret organization, so I’m forbidden to tell you anything.’When his cousin continued to threaten him, he said: ‘No, really, I can’t tell you. Theonly thing I can say is that Arco is an organization specializing in sabotage.’ He went onto explain that both the water in the girls’ hair lacquer and the girl being tied to the treewere punishments for their having crossed the chalk frontier scratched on the ground tomark the borders of Arco territory, beyond which lay an area ‘forbidden to girls’.When evidence of Paulo’s involvement in the matter reached his parents, they were"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"in no doubt that, when he was old enough, the boy should definitely be placed in thestern, wise hands of the Jesuits. While at Our Lady Victorious, he became accustomedto the regime that he would find at St Ignatius, for, unlike at other schools, the pupilshad classes on Saturdays and were free on Wednesdays. This meant that Paulo only hadSunday to play with his friends on the estate. On Saturdays, when they were all off, hehad to spend the day at school. On Wednesdays, when he was free but had nocompanions, he had no alternative but to stay at home reading and studying.The children at Our Lady Victorious ranged in age from seven to eleven, and theschool made a point of inculcating the pupils with a belief in the values of hard workand of respect for one’s fellows. The children had to learn by heart the school rules, oneof which was: ‘It shows a lack of politeness, Christian charity and fellowship to woundless talented or less intelligent colleagues by words or laughter.’ Coelho loathed all thesubjects he was taught, without exception. The only reason he put up with the tormentof spending his days bent over his books was that he had to get good marks in order tomove up to the next year. In the first two years he spent at Our Lady Victorious, hemanaged to achieve well-above-average marks. However, from the third year on, thingsbegan to slip, as can be seen in a letter he sent to Pedro on Father’s Day in 1956:Papa,I only got one in my maths test, so I’m going to have to study with youevery night. My averages in the other subjects improved though. In religion Iwent from zero to six, in Portuguese from zero to six and a half, but in maths Iwent from four and a half to two and a half. My overall place in the class wasstill pretty bad, but I improved a bit, moving from twenty-fifth to sixteenth.Love,PauloTwenty-fifth was, in fact, bottom of the class, given that the classes at Our LadyVictorious had a maximum of twenty-five boys in them. However, the fact that he wasbottom of the class didn’t mean that the Coelhos were bringing up a fool. On thecontrary. Their son may have hated studying, but he loved reading. He would readanything and everything, from fairy tales to Tarzan, and whatever his parents boughthim or his friends lent him. Little by little, Coelho became the estate’s residentstoryteller. Years later, his aunt, Cecília Dantas Arraes, would recall the ‘boy withskinny legs and baggy, wide-legged trousers’: ‘When he wasn’t thinking up somemischief, he would be sitting on the pavement with his friends around him while he toldstories.’One night, he was with his parents and grandparents watching a quiz programme,The Sky’s the Limit. A professor was answering questions about the Roman Empire and"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"when the quiz master asked the professor who had succeeded Julius Caesar, Paulojumped up and, to everyone’s astonishment, said: ‘Octavius Augustus’, adding: ‘I’vealways liked Octavius Augustus. He was the one August was named after, and that’s themonth I was born in.’Knowing more than his friends was one way of compensating for his physicalweakness. He was very thin, frail and short, and both on the estate and at school he wasknown as ‘Pele’–‘skin’–a Rio term used at the time for boys who were always gettingbeaten up by their classmates. He may have been his peers’ favourite victim, but hesoon learned that knowing things no one else knew and reading stories none of his peershad read was one way of gaining their respect.He realized that he would never come top in anything at school, but when helearned that there was to be a writing competition for all the boys in the third year, hedecided to enter. The subject was ‘The Father of Aviation’, Alberto Santos Dumont.This is what Coelho wrote:Once upon a time, there was a boy named Alberto Santos Dumont. Every day,early in the morning, Alberto would watch the birds flying and sometimes hewould think: ‘If eagles can fly, why can’t I, after all, I’m more intelligent thanthe eagles.’ Santos Dumont then decided to study hard, and his father and hismother, Francisca Dumont, sent him to an aeromodelling school.Other people, such as Father Bartholomew and Augusto Severo, had tried tofly before. Augusto Severo flew in a balloon that he had built, but it fell toearth and he died. But Santos Dumont did not give up. He built a balloon thatwas a tube filled with gas and he flew, went round the Jefel [sic] Tower in Parisand landed in the same place he had taken off from.Then he decided to invent an aeroplane that was heavier than air. Its shellwas made of bamboo and silk. In 1906, in Champs de Bagatelle, he tried out theaeroplane. Lots of people laughed, convinced he would never fly. But SantosDumont with his 14-bis travelled along for more than 220 metres and suddenlythe wheels left the ground. When the crowd saw it there was a cry of ‘Ah!’ Andthat was it, aviation had been invented.The best composition was to be chosen by a vote among the pupils. Paulo was solacking in confidence that when it came to voting, he ended up choosing the work ofanother pupil. When the votes were counted, though, he was astonished to find that hewas the winner. The pupil for whom he had voted came second, but was laterdisqualified when it was discovered that he had copied the text from a newspaperarticle.However, Paulo’s performance in the competition was not reflected in other"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"subjects. When the time came for him to take the entrance exam for St Ignatius, thestrict discipline and sacrifices imposed by the harsh regime at Our Lady Victoriousproved useless and he failed. As punishment, in order to prepare for the retake, he wasforced to stay in Rio having private lessons. This meant he had to forgo the annualfamily holiday in Araruama, where one of his uncles lived. To make sure that he had nospare time, his mother, who was also concerned by his lack of physical strength,decided that in the mornings he would attend PE classes at a holiday camp in Fortalezade São João, an army unit in the peaceful, romantic area of Urca in the central region ofRio. Forced to do the two things he most hated–physical exercise in the morning andstudying in the afternoon–Paulo felt as if he were spending two months in hell.Every morning, Lygia took a bus with her son that went directly from Botafogo toUrca, where she handed him over to his tormentors. The climax of the nightmare wasthe dreaded jump into the river, which the boys–about fifty of them–were forced to doevery day at the end of a seemingly endless session of bending, running and bar work.The boys, who were always accompanied by adult instructors, were placed in line andforced to jump from a bridge into the icy water of the river that cuts through the woodsaround the fortress. Even though he knew there was no chance of drowning or beinghurt, the mere thought of doing this made Paulo panic. Initially, he was always last inline. His heart would pound, the palms of his hands would sweat and he felt like crying,calling for his mother, even peeing his pants: he would have done anything to avoidmaking that leap were it not for the fact that he was even more afraid of looking like acoward. Then he discovered the solution: ‘If I was first in line, I would suffer for lesstime.’ Problem solved. ‘Not that I got over my fear of jumping,’ he recalled years later,‘but the suffering ended and I learned my first lesson in life: if it’s going to hurt,confront the problem straight away because at least then the pain will stop.’These were, in fact, wasted days, in terms of both money and suffering, since heagain failed the entrance exam. After spending the whole of 1958 preparing, however,he finally passed and did so with the excellent average mark of 8.3. High marks not onlyguaranteed admission to the school but also meant being given the title of ‘Count’. Ifhis performance improved still more he could become a ‘Marquis’ or even, as allparents dreamed of their children becoming, a ‘Duke’, a title reserved for those whoended the year with an average of 10 in all subjects.But he never fulfilled his parents’ dream. The entrance exam was the one momentof glory in his educational career. A graph based on his school reports for 1959 onwardsshows a descending curve that would only end when he completed his science course in1965 at one of the worst colleges in Rio de Janeiro. It was as though he were saying tohis parents: ‘Your dream of having a son at St Ignatius has come true, now leave me inpeace.’ As he himself remarked many years later, that mark of 8.3 was his final act inthe world of the normal."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3SchooldaysIF THE DEVIL WAS HIDING in the hallowed walls of St Ignatius, paradise was 100kilometres from Rio in Araruama, where Paulo Coelho usually spent the schoolholidays, almost always with his sister, Sônia Maria, who was two years younger. Whenfamily finances allowed, which was rare, they would go to Belém do Pará, where theirpaternal grandparents lived. Araruama, famous for its long beaches, was chosen by theCoelhos not for its natural beauty but because they had a guaranteed welcome at thehome of Paulo’s great-uncle, the eccentric José Braz Araripe. He had graduated inmechanical engineering and, in the 1920s, had been employed by the state-ownednavigation company Lóide Brasileiro to run the ship repair yard owned by the companyin the United States. With the help of another Brazilian engineer, Fernando Iehly deLemos, Araripe spent all his free time in the Lóide laboratories working on thedevelopment of an invention that would change his life, as well as that of millions ofconsumers worldwide: the automatic gear box. Araripe based his invention on aprototype created in 1904 by the Sturtevant brothers in Boston, which was never takenup because it had only two speeds and would only work when the engine was on fullpower. It was not until 1932, after countless hours of tests, that Araripe’s and Lemos’srevolutionary invention was finally patented. That year, General Motors bought therights from them for mass production, which began in 1938 when GM announced thatthe Oldsmobile had as an option the greatest thing since the invention of the automobileitself: the Hydra-Matic system, a luxury for which the consumer would pay anadditional US$70, about a tenth of the total price of the car. Some say that the twoBrazilians each pocketed a small fortune in cash at the time, and nothing else; otherssay that both opted to receive a percentage of each gearbox sold during their lifetime.Whatever the truth of the matter, from then on, money was never a problem for Araripe,or ‘Uncle José’, as he was known to his great-nephew and -niece.With no worries about the future, Uncle José left Lóide and returned to Brazil. Itmight have been expected that he would live in Rio, close to his family; however,during his time in the United States, he had suffered a slight accident at work, whichcaused him to lose some movement in his left arm, and someone told him that the blacksands of Araruama would be an infallible remedy. He moved there, bought a large pieceof land on one of the main streets in the city, and built a six-bedroom house in which allthe walls and furniture were retractable. At the command of their owner, walls, beds andtables would disappear, turning the residence into a large workshop where Uncle José"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"worked and built his inventions.In summer, walls and furniture would be restored in readiness to receive thechildren. One night a week during the holidays, the walls would disappear again in orderto create an area for watching 35mm films on a professional film projector and theworkshop would become a cinema. Some summers, Uncle José would have more thantwenty guests, among them his great-nephews and -nieces, friends, and the few adultswho had the impossible job of keeping an eye on the children. The children’s parentswere appalled by the man’s unconventional behaviour, but the comfort he offered themoutweighed their concerns. Anxious mothers whispered that, as well as being an atheist,José held closed sessions of pornographic films when there were only boys in thehouse–which was, indeed, true–and he took off his oil-stained dungarees (under whichhe never wore underpants) only on special occasions; but he was open and generous andshared the eccentricities of his house with his neighbours. When he learned that thetelevision he had bought was the only one in town, he immediately turned the screen toface the street and thus improvised a small auditorium where, from seven to ten atnight, everyone could enjoy the new phenomenon.Michele Conte and Jorge Luiz Ramos, two of Coelho’s friends in Araruama, recallthat, every year, Coelho would arrive from Rio bearing some new ‘toy’. Once, it was aDiana airgun with which he shot his first bird, a grassquit whose black wings hecarefully plucked and stuck to a piece of paper with the date and a note of the bird’scharacteristics (a trophy that was to remain among his childhood mementoes in hishouse in Rio). The following year, he appeared with a diving mask and flippers, whichprompted Uncle José to make him a submarine harpoon, its shafts propelled by a wirespring like a medieval man-of-war.Like the other children, visitors and locals, Paulo woke every day when it was stilldark. The town’s residents recall a boy with skinny legs, knee-length socks and baggyshorts. The group would disappear off into the woods, explore the lakes, steal boats andgo fishing, invade orchards or explore grottoes and caves. On returning home at the endof the day, they would hand over the spoils of their expedition–doves brought downwith shot or fish spiked with Uncle José’s harpoon–to Rosa, the cook, who would cleanand prepare them for dinner. They would often return bruised or scratched or, as was thecase once with Paulo, having been arrested by the forest rangers for hunting wildanimals.When Lygia arrived at the weekend to see her children, she would find herself in aparty atmosphere. She would take up her guitar and spend the nights playing songs byTrini Lopez and by the rising star Roberto Carlos, accompanied by the children. Theonly thing Paulo did not enjoy was dancing. He found the parades in Rio fun, but hateddancing, and felt ridiculous when forced by his friends to jump around at Carnivaldances in Araruama. To avoid humiliation, he would go straight to the toilets when hearrived at the club, hold his shirt under the tap and put it on again, soaking wet. If"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"anyone invited him to dance he had his excuse ready: ‘I’ve just been dancing. Look howsweaty I am. I’m going to take a break–I’ll be back soon.’Araruama was the place where he made various adolescent discoveries, like gettingdrunk for the first time. He and two friends went to one of the town’s deserted beachesand swiftly downed two bottles of rum he had bought secretly in Rio and concealedamong his clothes at the bottom of his suitcase. As a result, he fell asleep on the beachand woke with his body all swollen with sunburn. He was ill for several days. So badwas the hangover that, unlike most boys of his generation, he never became a seriousdrinker.He also experienced his first kiss on one of these holidays. Although he liked toboast theatrically to his friends that destiny had reserved something rather different forhis first kiss, namely a prostitute, that kiss in fact took place in the innocent atmosphereof Araruama and was shared with the eldest sister of his friend Michele, Élide–or Dedê–who was a little younger than he. It was in Araruama, too, that he experienced his firstsexual impulses. When he discovered that his uncle had made the walls of the rooms ofvery light, thin wood so that they could easily be raised, Paulo managed secretly to borea hole in one wall large enough for him to enjoy the solitary privilege, before fallingasleep, of spying on his female cousins, who were sleeping naked in the next room. Hewas shocked to see that girls had curly hair covering their private parts. In hisamazement, he grew breathless, his heart pounded and his legs shook, so much so thathe feared that he might have an asthma attack and be caught in flagrante.The respiratory problems he had suffered from since birth had developed, withpuberty, into a debilitating asthma. The attacks, which were caused by a variety ofthings–changes in the weather, dust, mould, smoke–were unpredictable. They beganwith breathlessness, a cough and a whistling in his chest, and culminated in terriblefeelings of asphyxia, when his lungs felt as if they were about to burst. He had to makesure that he always had his bag full of cough syrups, medication to dilate the bronchialtubes (usually in the form of cortisone tablets) and a ‘puffer’ to alleviate the symptoms.Quite often his parents would take it in turns to sit by his bed at night in order to bethere during an emergency and once, in despair, Lygia took him to a faith healer whohad been recommended by friends. When they arrived at the consulting room, the mangazed fixedly into Paulo’s eyes and said just five words: ‘I can see Dr Fritz.’* This wasenough for Lygia to take her son by the hand and leave, muttering: ‘This is no place fora Christian.’ When the asthma manifested itself in Araruama, far from his mother’scare, the exchange of letters between Paulo and his mother became more frequent and,at times, worrying: ‘Could you come with Aunt Elisa to look after me?’ he asked,tearfully. Such requests would provoke anxious telegrams from Lygia to the aunt wholooked after the children on holiday, one saying: ‘I’m really worried about Paulo’sasthma. The doctor said he should be given one ampoule of Reductil for three days andtwo Meticorten tablets a day. Let me know how things are.’"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Although he said that he loved receiving letters, but hated writing them, as soon ashe could read and write, and when he was away from home, Paulo would fill page afterpage, mostly addressed to his parents. Their content reveals a mature, delicate childconcerned with his reputation as a bad, ill-behaved student. His letters to Lygia weremawkish and full of sentimentality, like this one, sent on Mother’s Day 1957, when hewas nine:Dear Mama: No, no, we don’t need May 8th to remember all the good thingswe’ve received from you. Your constant love and dedication, even thoughwe’re, very often, bad, disobedient children.[...] The truth is, it’s your love that forgives us. That resilient love thatnever snaps like chewing gum. May God keep you, darling Mama, and forgivemy errors because I’m still only small and I promise to improve very verysoon.Lots of love,PaulinhoThe letters he sent to his father were more formal, even down to the signature, andwritten in a rather complaining tone.Papa,Have you sent my leaflets to be printed? And how is the new house going?When are we going to move in?I’m counting on your presence here the next time you come.Love,Paulo CoelhoAs time went by, letter-writing became a regular thing for him. He would write to hisparents, uncles and aunts, grandparents and friends. If he had no one to write to, hewould simply jot down his ideas on small pieces of paper and then hide his scribbledthoughts in a secret place away from prying eyes. When he was about twelve he boughta pocket diary in which he began to make daily entries. He would always write in ink, ina slightly wobbly hand, but with few grammatical errors. He began by recording typicaladolescent tasks–‘tidy my desk’, ‘Fred’s birthday’ and ‘send a telegram to GrandpaCazuza’–and gradually he also began to record things he had done, seen or merelythought. Sometimes these were short notes to himself, such as ‘swap s. with Zeca’,‘papa: equations’ and ‘do part E of the plan’. This was also the first time he sketched aself-portrait:"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"I was born on 24 August 1947 in the São José Hospital. I have lived on thisestate since I was small. I have attended three schools and in all three I wasregarded as a prince because of the way I dressed. I’ve always had good marksin all the schools I’ve been to.I really like studying, but I also like playing. I’ve never been interested inopera or romantic music. I hate rock-and-roll, but I really like popularBrazilian music. I only like carnival when I’m taken to fancy-dress balls.I really like adventures, but I’m scared of dangerous things [...] I’ve hadseveral girlfriends already. I love sport. I want to be a chemist when I grow upbecause I like working with flasks and medicines. I love the cinema, fishingand making model aeroplanes.I like reading comics and doing crosswords. I hate picnics and outings oranything that’s boring.This regular exercise of writing about himself or things that happened during the dayattracted him so much that he began to record everything–either in a diary kept in aspiral notebook or by dictating into a cassette recorder and keeping the tapes. Later,with the arrival of computers he put together the entire set of records covering the fourdecades of confessions that he had accumulated up until then and stored them in a trunk,which he padlocked. In those 170 handwritten notebooks and 94 cassettes lay hidden theminutiae of his life and soul from 1959, when he was twelve years old, up to 1995, whenhe was forty-eight and began to write directly on to a computer. He was famous by then,and had stated in his will that immediately following his death, the trunk and its entirecontents should be burned. However, for reasons that will be explained later, he changedhis mind and allowed the writer of this biography free access to this material. Diariesare records produced almost simultaneously with the emotion or action described, andare often cathartic exercises for the person writing them. This is clear from Coelho’sdiaries, where he often speaks of the more perverse sides of his personality, often to thedetriment of his more generous and sensitive side.The diary gave the author the freedom to fantasize at will. Contrary to what hewrote in the self-portrait quoted above, Coelho rarely dressed smartly, he loathedstudying just as he loathed sport and his love life was not always happy. According tohis diary, his cousin Cecília, his neighbour Mónica, who lived on the estate, Dedê, withwhom he shared his first kiss in Araruama, and Ana Maria, or Tatá, a pretty dark-hairedgirl with braces, were all girlfriends. Young love is often a troubling business, and theappearance of the last of these girls in his life was the subject of dramaticallyembroidered reports. ‘For the first time, I cried because of a woman,’ he wrote. Atnight, unable to sleep, he saw himself as a character in a tragedy: as he cycled past hislover’s house, he was run over by a car and fell to the ground covered in blood.Somehow, Tatá was there at his side and knelt sobbing beside his body in time to hear"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"him utter his last words: ‘This is my blood. It was shed for you. Remember me...’Although the relationship was purely platonic, Tatá’s parents took an immediatedislike to Coelho. Forbidden to continue her relationship with that ‘strange boy’, shenevertheless stood up to her family. She told Paulo that her mother had even hit her, butstill she wouldn’t give him up. However, when he was holidaying in Araruama, hereceived a two-line note from Chico, a friend who lived on the estate: ‘Tatá has told meto tell you it’s all over. She’s in love with someone else.’ It was as though the walls inUncle José’s house had fallen in on him. It wasn’t just the loss of his girlfriend but theloss of face before his friends for having been so betrayed, cuckolded by a woman. Hecould take anything but that. He therefore invented an extraordinary story, which hedescribed in a letter to his friend the following day. Chico was told to tell everyone thathe had lied about his relationship with Tatá he had never actually felt anything for her,but as a secret agent of the CIC–the Central Intelligence Center, a US spy agency–hehad received instructions to draw up a dossier on her. This was the only reason he hadgot close to her. A week later, after receiving a second letter from Chico, he noted in hisdiary: ‘He believed my story, but from now on, I have a whole string of lies to live upto. Appearances have been saved, but my heart is aching.’Lygia and Pedro also had aching hearts, although not because of love. The firstmonths their son had spent at St Ignatius had been disastrous. The days when he broughtback his monthly grades were a nightmare. While his sister, Sônia Maria, was gettingtop marks at her school, Paulo’s marks got steadily worse. With only rare exceptions–usually in unimportant subjects such as choral singing or craftwork–he hardly everachieved the necessary average of 5 if he was to stay on at the school. It was only whenhe was forced to study for hours on end at home and given extra tuition in varioussubjects that he managed to complete the first year, but even then his average was onlya poor 6.3. In the second year, things deteriorated still further. He continued to get highmarks in choral singing, but couldn’t achieve even the minimum average grade in thesubjects that mattered–maths, Portuguese, history, geography, Latin and English.However, his parents were sure that the iron hand of the Jesuits would bring theiressentially good-natured son back to the straight and narrow.As time went by, he became more and more timid, retiring and insecure. He beganto lose interest even in the favourite sport of his schoolmates, which was to stand at thegates of the Colégio Jacobina, where his sister was a pupil, to watch the girls comingout. This was a delight they would all remember for the rest of their lives, as the authorand scriptwriter Ricardo Hofstetter, who was also a pupil at the Jesuit college, was torecall:It was pure magic to walk those two or three blocks to see them coming out. Istill have the image in my mind: the girls’ slim, exquisite legs, half on view,half hidden by their pleated skirts. They came out in groups, groups of legs and"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"pleated skirts that the wind would make even more exciting. Anyone whoexperienced this knows that there was nothing more sublime in the world,although I never went out with a girl at the Jacobina.Nor did Paulo, not at the Jacobina or anywhere else. Apart from innocent flirtations andnotes exchanged with the girls on the estate or in Araruama, he reached youngadulthood without ever having had a real girlfriend. When his friends got together tobrag about their conquests–never anything more than holding hands or a quick kiss or asqueeze–he was the only one who had no adventure to talk of. Fate had not made himhandsome. His head was too big for his skinny body and his shoulders narrow. He hadfleshy lips, like his father’s, and his nose, too, seemed overlarge for the face of a boy ofhis age.He became more solitary with each day that passed and buried himself in books–notthose the Jesuits had them read at school, which he loathed, but adventure stories andnovels. However, while he may have become a voracious reader, this still did notimprove his performance at school. At the end of every year, in the public prize-givingceremonies, he had become used to seeing his colleagues–some of whom went on tobecome leading figures in Brazilian public life–receiving diplomas and medals, whilehe was never once called to go up to the dais. He only narrowly avoided being keptdown a year and thus forced to find another school, since at St Ignatius, staying downwas synonymous with being thrown out.While their son proved himself to be a resounding failure, his parents at least livedin hope that he would become a good Christian and, indeed, he appeared to be well onthe way to this. While averse to study, he felt comfortable in the heavily religiousatmosphere of the college. He would don his best clothes and happily attend theobligatory Sunday mass, which was celebrated entirely in Latin, and he became familiarwith the mysterious rituals such as covering the images of the saints during Lent withpurple cloths. Even the dark underground catacombs where the mortal remains of theJesuits lay aroused his curiosity, although he never had the courage to visit them.His parents’ hopes were re-awakened during his fourth year, when he decided to goon a retreat held by the school. These retreats lasted three or four days, and took placeduring the week so that they would not seem like a holiday camp or mere recreation.They were always held at the Padre Anchieta Retreat House, or the Casa da Gávea, as itwas known–a country house high up in the then remote district of São Conrado, 15kilometres from the centre of Rio. Built in 1935 and surrounded by woods, it was alarge three-storey building with thirty blue-framed windows in the front. These were thewindows of the bedrooms where the guests stayed, each with a magnificent view of thedeserted beach of São Conrado. The Jesuits never tired of repeating that the silence inthe house was so complete that at any hour of the day or night and in any corner of thebuilding you could hear the waves breaking on the beach below."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"It was on a hot October morning in 1962 that Paulo left for his encounter with God.In a small suitcase packed by his mother, he took, as well as his clothes and personalbelongings, his new, inseparable companions: a notebook and a fountain pen with whichto make the notes that were more and more taking on the form of a diary. At eight in themorning, all the boys were standing in the college courtyard and as they waited for thebus to take them to the retreat house, Coelho was suddenly filled with courage. Withtwo friends he went into the chapel in the dark, and walked round the altar and down thestairs towards the catacombs. Lit only by candles, the crypt, which was full of coffins,looked even gloomier. To his surprise, though, instead of being filled with terror, as hehad always imagined he would be, he had an indescribable feeling of wellbeing. Heseemed inspired to search for an explanation for his unexpected bravery. ‘Perhaps Iwasn’t seeing death in all its terror,’ he wrote in his notebook, ‘but the eternal rest ofthose who had lived and suffered for Jesus.’Half an hour later, they were all at the Casa da Gávea. During the days thatfollowed, Paulo shared with another young boy a bare cubicle provided with two beds, awardrobe, a table, two chairs and a little altar attached to the wall. In a corner was achina wash basin and above it a mirror. Once they had unpacked, both boys went downto the refectory, where they were given tea and biscuits. The spiritual guide for thegroup was Father João Batista Ruffier, who announced the rules of the retreat, the firstof which would come into force in the next ten minutes: a vow of silence. From then on,until they left at the end of the retreat, no one was allowed to say a single word. FatherRuffier, who was a stickler for the rules, was about to give one of his famous sermons,one that would remain in the memory of generations of those who attended St Ignatius.‘You are here like machines going into the workshop for a service. You can expectto be taken apart piece by piece. Don’t be afraid of the amount of dirt that will comeout. The most important thing is that you put back each piece in its right place with totalhonesty.’The sermon lasted almost an hour, but it was those opening words that went roundand round in Paulo’s head all afternoon, as he walked alone in the woods surroundingthe house. That night he wrote in his diary, ‘I have reviewed all my thoughts of the lastfew days and I’m ready to put things right.’ He said a Hail Mary and an Our Father, andfell asleep.Although Father Ruffier had made it clear what the retreat was for–‘Here you willdrive away the temptations of life and consecrate yourselves to meditation and prayer’–not everyone was there for Christian reflection. Everyone knew that once dinner wasover and after the final prayer of the day had been said, shadows would creep along thedark corridors of the house to meet secretly in small groups for whispered games ofpoker and pontoon. If one of the boys had managed to smuggle in a transistor radio–something that was expressly forbidden–someone would immediately suggest placing abet on the races at the Jockey Club. From midnight to dawn the religious atmosphere"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"was profaned by betting, smoking and even drinking contraband whisky concealed inshampoo bottles. Whenever a light in a cubicle warned of suspicious activities, one ofthe more attentive priests would immediately turn off the electricity. This, however,didn’t always resolve the problem, since the heretical game would continue in the lightfrom candles purloined from the chapel during the day.On the second day, Paulo woke at five in the morning, his mind confused, althoughhis spirits improved a little when he opened the bedroom window and saw the suncoming up over the sea. At six on the dot, still not having eaten, he met his colleaguesin the chapel for the daily mass, prepared to put things right with God and do somethinghe had been putting off for almost a year: taking communion. The problem was notcommunion itself but the horror of confession, with which all the boys were familiar.They would arrive at the confessional prepared to reveal only the most banal of sins, butthey knew that, in the end, the priest would always ask the inevitable question: ‘Haveyou sinned against chastity, my son?’ Should the reply be in the affirmative, thequestions that followed were more probing: ‘Alone or with someone else?’ If it waswith someone else, the priest would continue, to the mortification of the more timidboys: ‘With a person or an animal?’ If the response was ‘with a person’, the sinner wasnot required to reveal the name of the partner, only the sex: ‘With a boy or with a girl?’Paulo found this an extremely difficult topic to deal with and he didn’t understandhow it could be a sin. He was so convinced that masturbation was not a shamefulactivity that he wrote in his notebook: ‘No one on this earth can throw the first stone atme, because no one has avoided this temptation.’ In spite of this, he had never had thecourage to confess to a priest that he masturbated, and living in a permanent state of sintroubled him deeply. With his soul divided, he preferred merely to say the act ofcontrition and to receive communion without going to confession.Following mass, Father Ruffier returned to the charge with a particularly harshsermon. Before a terrified audience, he painted a terrifying picture of the place intendedfor all sinners: ‘We are in hell! The fire is burning mercilessly! Here one sees only tearsand hears only the grinding of teeth in mutual loathing. I come across a colleague andcurse him for being the cause of my condemnation. And while we weep in pain andremorse, the Devil smiles a smile that makes our suffering still greater. But the worstpunishment, the worst pain, the worst suffering is that we have no hope. We are here forever.’Paulo was in no doubt: Father Ruffier was talking about him. After twelve monthswithout going to confession–so as not to have to touch on the taboo subject ofmasturbation–he realized that if he were to die suddenly, his final destiny would be hell.He imagined the Devil looking into his eyes and snickering: ‘My dear boy, yoursuffering hasn’t even begun yet.’ He felt helpless, powerless and confused. He had noone to turn to, but he knew that a Jesuit retreat was a place of certainties, not of doubts.Faced with a choice between suffering in the flames for all eternity as described by the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"priest and giving up his solitary pleasure, he chose faith. Deeply moved and kneelingalone on the stone floor of the mirador, he turned to God and made a solemn promisenever to masturbate again.His decision gave him courage and calmed him, but that feeling of calm was short-lived. The following day, the Devil counter-attacked with such force that he could notresist the temptation and, defeated, he masturbated. He left the bathroom as though hishands were covered in blood, knelt in front of the altar and implored: ‘Lord! I want tochange, but I can’t stop myself! I’ve said endless acts of contrition, but I can’t stopsinning. I sin in thought, word and deed. Give me strength! Please! Please! Please!’ Fullof despair, he only felt relief when, in a whispered conversation in the woods, he foundthat he had a companion in eternal suffering: a fellow pupil who had also beenmasturbating during the retreat.Ashamed of his own weakness, Paulo was subjected to two more sermons fromFather Ruffier, which seemed to have been chosen especially to instil fear into theminds of the boys. Once again, the priest deployed dramatic and terrifying images, thistime to alert the boys to the perils of clinging on to material values. From the pulpitFather Ruffier gesticulated like an actor, shaking his short, muscular arms and saying:‘Truly, truly I say unto you, my children: the time will come when we shall all be laidlow. Imagine yourselves dying. In the hospital room, your relatives white with fear. Thebedside table is crammed with different medicines, all useless now. It is then that yousee how powerless you are. You humbly recognize that you are powerless. What goodwill fame, money, cars, luxuries be at the fatal hour? What use are those things if yourdeath lies in the hands of the Creator?’ With his fists clenched, and as though possessedby divine fury, he declared vehemently: ‘We must give up everything, my sons! Wemust give up everything!’These words should not be confused with an exhortation to embrace socialism oranything of the sort. Not only were the sons of some of the wealthiest families in Rio deJaneiro in the congregation, but the college was politically conservative and was alwaysshowing films of executions by firing squads in Fidel Castro’s Cuba in order to showthe boys ‘the bloodthirsty nature of communism’. And Father Ruffier himself wasproud of the fact that he had had to leave Colombia in a hurry ‘to flee communism’ (hewas referring to the popular uprising in Bogotá in 1948, known as the Bogotazo).While the boys stared at each other in astonishment, the priest spoke again. Thesubject was, once again, hell. Just in case he had not made himself clear in the first partof his sermon, he once more described the eternal state of suffering to which sinnerswould be condemned: ‘Hell is like the sea that is there before us. Imagine a swallowcoming along every hundred years and taking a drop of water each time. That swallowis you and that is your penance. You will suffer for millions and millions of years, butone day the sea will be empty. And you will say: at last, it’s over and I can rest inpeace.’ He paused, then concluded: ‘But then the Creator will smile from the heights"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"and will say: “That was just the beginning. Now you will see other seas and that is howit will be for all eternity. The swallow empties the sea and I fill it up again.”’Paulo spent the rest of the day with these words echoing in his head. He went intothe woods that surrounded the retreat house and tried to distract himself with the beautyof the view, but Father Ruffier’s words only resonated inside him more loudly. Thatnight, he set down his thoughts before finally falling asleep, and the notes he madeappear to demonstrate the efficacy of the spiritual retreat.Here, I’ve completely forgotten the world. I’ve forgotten that I’m going to failmaths, I’ve forgotten that Botafogo is top of the league and I’ve forgotten thatI’m going to spend next week on the island of Itaipu. But I feel that with everymoment spent forgetting, I’m learning to understand the world better. I’mgoing back to a world that I didn’t understand before and which I hated, butwhich the retreat has taught me to love and understand. I’ve learnt here to seethe beauty that lies in a piece of grass and in a stone. In short, I’ve learnt howto live.Most important was the fact that he returned home certain that he had acquired thevirtue which–through all the highs and lows of his life–would prove to be theconnecting thread: faith. Even his parents, who appeared to have lost all hope of gettinghim back on the straight and narrow, were thrilled with the new Paulo. ‘We’re veryhappy to see that you finally appear to have got back on the right track,’ Lygia declaredwhen he returned. Her son’s conversion had been all that was missing to completedomestic bliss, for a few months earlier, the family had finally moved into the largepink house built by Pedro Coelho with his own hands.In fact, the move to Gávea happened before the building was completed, whichmeant that they still had to live for some time among tins of paint, sinks and baths piledup in corners. However, the house astonished everyone, with its dining room, sittingroom and drawing room, its ensuite bathrooms in every bedroom, its marble staircaseand its verandah. There was also an inner courtyard so large that Paulo later thought ofusing it as a rehearsal space for his plays. The move was a shock to Paulo. Moving fromthe estate in Botafogo, where he was born and where he was the unchallenged leader, toGávea, which, at the time, was a vast wasteland with few houses and buildings, was apainful business. The change of district did nothing to lessen his parents’ earlier fears,or, rather, his father’s, and, obsessively preoccupied with the harm that the ‘outsideworld’ might do to his son’s character and education, Pedro thought it best to ban himfrom going out at night. Suddenly, Paulo no longer had any friends and his life wasreduced to three activities: sleeping, going to classes at St Ignatius and reading at home.Reading was nothing new. He had even managed to introduce a clause concerning"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"books in the Arco statutes, stating that, ‘besides other activities, every day must includesome recreational reading’. He had begun reading the children’s classics that Brazilianparents liked to give their children; then he moved on to Conan Doyle and had soon readall of Sherlock Holmes. When he was told to read the annotated edition of The Slum byAluísio Azevedo at school, he began by ridiculing it: ‘I’m not enjoying the book. I don’tknow why Aluísio Azevedo brings sex into it so much.’ Some chapters later, however,he radically changed his mind and praised the work highly: ‘At last I’m beginning tounderstand the book: life without ideals, full of betrayal and remorse. The lesson I tookfrom it is that life is long and disappointing. The Slum is a sublime book. It makes usthink of the sufferings of others.’ What had initially been a scholastic exercise hadbecome a pleasure. From then on, he wrote reviews of all the books he read. His reportsmight be short and sharp, such as ‘weak plot’ when writing about Aimez-vous Brahms?by Françoise Sagan, or, in the case of Vuzz by P.A. Hourey, endless paragraphs sayinghow magnificent it was.He read anything and everything, from Michel Quoist’s lyrical poems to Jean-PaulSartre. He would read best-sellers by Leon Uris, Ellery Queen’s detective stories andpseudo-scientific works such as O Homem no Cosmos by Helio Jaguaribe, which heclassed in his notes as ‘pure, poorly disguised red propaganda’. Such condensed reviewsgive the impression that he read with one eye on the aesthetic and the other on goodbehaviour. Remarks such as ‘His poetry contains the more degrading and entirelyunnecessary aspects of human morality’ (on Para Viver um Grande Amor by Viniciusde Moraes) or ‘Brazilians aren’t yet ready for this kind of book’ (referring to the playBonitinha, mas Ordinária by Nelson Rodrigues) were frequent in his listings. He hadeven more to say on Nelson Rodrigues: ‘It’s said that he’s a slave to the public, but Idon’t agree. He was born for this type of literature, and it’s not the people who aremaking him write it.’Politically his reactions were no less full of preconceptions. When he saw the filmSeara Vermelha, which was based on the book of the same name by Jorge Amado, heregretted that it was a work that was ‘clearly communist in outlook, showing man’sexploitation of man’. He was pleasantly surprised, however, when he read Amado’sbest-seller Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon; indeed, he was positively intoxicated: ‘It’sso natural...There’s not a trace of communism in its pages. I really liked it.’ He felt thatManuel Bandeira was the greatest Brazilian poet (‘because he leaves aside unhealthyaspects of life, and because of his simple, economical style’); he loathed João Cabral deMelo Neto (‘I read some of his verses and I shut the book immediately’); and heconfessed that he didn’t understand Carlos Drummond de Andrade (‘He has a confused,abstract style, which makes it hard to interpret his poetry’).It was apparently at this time, when he was thirteen or fourteen, that Paulo showedthe first signs of an undying idée fixe, a real obsession that he would never lose–to be awriter. Almost half a century later, as one of the most widely read authors of all time,"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"he wrote in The Zahir:I write because when I was an adolescent, I was useless at football, I didn’thave a car or much of an allowance, and I was pretty much of a weed...I didn’twear trendy clothes either. That’s all the girls in my class were interested in,and so they just ignored me. At night, when my friends were out with theirgirlfriends, I spent my free time creating a world in which I could be happy:my companions were writers and their books.In fact, he saw himself as a writer well before he said as much. Besides being thewinner of the writing competition at Our Lady Victorious, from the time he could readhe had become a full-time poet. He would write short verses and poems for his parents,grandparents, friends, cousins, girlfriends and even the saints revered by his family.Compositions such as ‘Our Lady, on this febrile adolescent night/I offer you my purechildhood/That the fire is now devouring/And transforming into smoke so that it mayrise up to you/And may the fire also free me from the past’, which was inspired by theVirgin Mary; or four-line verses written for his parents: ‘If the greatest good in theworld/Is given to those who are parents/Then it is also a certain truth/That it is they whosuffer most.’ If there was no one to whom he could dedicate his verses, he would writeto himself: ‘The past is over/And the future has not yet arrived/I wander through theimpossible present/Full of love, ideals and unbelief/As if I were simply/Passing throughlife.’When, at a later age, he grew to know more about books and libraries, he cameacross a quote attributed to Émile Zola, in which the author of J’Accuse said somethingalong the lines of ‘My poetic muse has turned out to be a very dull creature; from nowon, I shall write prose’. Whether or not these words were true of Zola, Paulo believedthat the words were written precisely for him. He wrote in his diary: ‘Today I ended mypoetic phase in order to devote myself solely to the theatre and the novel.’ He made abonfire in the garden of everything he had written up to then–vast quantities of poems,sonnets and verses.Such a promise, if meant seriously, would have been a proof of great ingratitude tothe art of verse, for it was a poem he wrote–‘Mulher de Treze Anos’ [‘Thirteen-year-oldWoman’]–that rescued him from anonymity among the 1,200 students at St Ignatius.One of the Jesuit traditions was the Academy of Letters of St Ignatius (ALSI), whichhad been created in 1941 and was responsible for cultural development of the students.Great names in Brazilian culture attended the events held by the ALSI. At the age offourteen, Paulo appeared for the first time in the pages of the magazine VitóriaColegial, the official publication of the ALSI, with a small text entitled ‘Why I LikeBooks’. It was an unequivocal defence of writers, whom he portrayed dramatically as"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"people who spent sleepless nights, ‘without eating, exploited by publishers’, only to dieforgotten:What does a book represent? A book represents an unequalled wealth ofculture. It is the book that opens windows on to the world for us. Through abook we experience the great adventures of Don Quixote and Tarzan as thoughwe ourselves were the characters; we laugh at the hilarious tales of DonCamilo, we suffer as the characters in other great works of world literaturesuffer. For this reason, I like to read books in my free time. Through books weprepare ourselves for the future. We learn, just by reading them, theories thatmeant sacrifice and even death for those who discovered them. Every didacticbook is a step in the direction of the country’s glorious horizon. This is why Ilike books when I’m studying. But what did it take for that book to arrive in ourhands? Great sacrifice on the part of the author, whole nights spent starving andforgotten, their room sometimes lit only by the spluttering flame of a candle.And then, exploited by their publishers, they died forgotten, unjustly forgotten.What willpower on the part of others was needed for them to achieve a littlefame! This is why I like books.Months later, the ALSI announced the date for entries for its traditional annual poetryprize. Paulo had just seen the Franco-Italian film Two Women, directed by Vittorio deSica, and left the cinema inspired. Based on the novel La Ciociara, by Alberto Moravia,the film tells the story of Cesira (Sophia Loren) and her thirteen-year-old daughterRosetta (Eleanora Brown), both of whom have been raped by Allied soldiers during theSecond World War. Paulo based his poem ‘Thirteen-year-old Woman’ on the characterof Rosetta, and it was that poem which he then entered for the competition.The day the poems were to be judged was one of endless agony. Paulo could thinkof nothing else. That evening, before the meeting when the three prize-winners were tobe announced, he overcame his shyness and asked a member of the jury, a Portugueseteacher, whom he had voted for. He blushed at the response: ‘I voted for you, Átila andChame.’Twenty poems were selected for the final. Paulo knew at least one of the chosenpoems, ‘Introduce’, by José Átila Ramos, which, in his opinion, was the favourite. If hisfriend won, that would be fine, and if he himself managed at least third place, thatwould be wonderful. At nine in the evening, the auditorium was full of nervous boyssoliciting votes and calculating their chances of winning. There was total silence as thejury, comprising two teachers and a pupil, began to announce in ascending order thethree winners. When he heard that in third place was ‘Serpentina and Columbina’ and insecond ‘Introduce’, he felt sure he hadn’t been placed at all. So he almost fell off his"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"chair when it was announced: ‘The winner, by unanimous vote, is the poem...“Thirteen-year-old Woman”, by Paulo Coelho de Souza!’First place! He couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Heart pounding and legsshaking, the slight young boy crossed the room and stepped up on to the stage to receivethe certificate and the prize, a cheque for 1,000 cruzeiros–about US$47. Once theceremony was over, he was one of the first to leave the college, desperate to go straighthome and for once give his parents some good news. On the tram on the way back toGávea, he began to choose his words and work out the best way to tell his father that hehad discovered his one and only vocation–to be a writer.He was therefore somewhat surprised on reaching the house to find his fatherstanding outside on the pavement, angrily tapping his watch and saying: ‘It’s almosteleven o’clock and you know perfectly well that in this house the doors are closed atten, no argument.’This time, though, Paulo had up his sleeve a trump card that would surely move hisfather’s cold heart. Smiling, he brandished the trophy he had just won–the cheque for1,000 cruzeiros–and told his father everything: the prize, the unanimous vote, thedozens of contestants, the discovery of his vocation.But even this failed to win over his grim father. Apparently ignoring everything hisson had said, Pedro poured cold water on the boy’s excitement, saying: ‘I’d prefer it ifyou got good marks at school and didn’t come home so late.’The thought that at least his mother would be thrilled by his win was dispelled in aninstant. When he saw her waiting at the front door, he told her, eyes shining, what hehad just told his father. To her son’s dismay, Lygia quietly gave him the same lecture:‘My boy, there’s no point dreaming about becoming a writer. It’s wonderful that youwrite all these things, but life is different. Just think: Brazil is a country of seventymillion inhabitants, it has thousands of writers, but Jorge Amado is the only one whocan make a living by writing. And there’s only one Jorge Amado.’Desperately unhappy, depressed and close to tears, Paulo did not get to sleep untildawn. He wrote just one line in his diary: ‘Mama is stupid. Papa is a fool.’ When hewoke, he had no doubt that his family was determined to bury for ever what hedramatically called ‘my only reason for living’–being a writer. For the first time, heseemed to recognize that he was prepared to pay dearly to realize his dream, even if thismeant clashing with his parents. Lygia and Pedro Queima Coelho were not going tohave long to wait."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4First play, first loveAT THE END OF 1962, at his father’s insistence, Paulo was forced to enrol in the sciencestream rather than the arts as he had hoped. His scholastic performance in the fourthyear had been disastrous, and he had finished the year having to re-sit maths, the subjectat which his father so excelled. In the end, he passed with a 5–not a decimal point morethan the mark required to move on to the next year and remain at St Ignatius. In spite ofthis and Paulo’s declared intention to study the arts, his parents insisted that he studyengineering and, following his appalling scholastic performance, he was in no positionto insist.However, from his point of view, the practical Pedro Coelho had reasons for hopingthat his son might yet be saved and become an engineer. These hopes lay not only in theinterest Paulo had shown in his grandfather’s success as a mechanic–professional andamateur. As a boy, Paulo had frequently asked his parents to buy him copies of themagazine Mecânica Popular, a publication dating from the 1950s that taught readershow to do everything from fixing floor polishers to building boats and houses. When hewas ten or eleven he was so passionate about aeroplane modelling that any father wouldhave seen in this a promising future as an aeronautical engineer. The difference wasthat, while lots of children play with model aeroplanes, Paulo set up the Clube Sunday,of which he and his cousin Fred, who lived in Belém, were sole members. Since adistance of 3,000 kilometres separated them and their aeroplanes, the club’s activitiesended up being a chronological list of the models each had acquired. At the end of eachmonth, Paulo would record all this information in a notebook–the names andcharacteristics of the small planes they had acquired, the serial number, wing span, dateand place of purchase, general construction expenses, the date, place and reason for theloss of the plane whenever this occurred. Not one of these pieces of information servedany purpose, but ‘It was best to keep things organized,’ Paulo said. When the gliderChiquita smashed into a wall in Gávea, it was thought worthy of special mention: ‘Itonly flew once, but since it was destroyed heroically, I award this plane the CombatCross. Paulo Coelho de Souza, Director.’This fascination for model aeroplanes rapidly disappeared, but it gave way toanother mania, even more auspicious for anyone wanting his son to be an engineer:making rockets. For some months Paulo and Renato Dias, a classmate at St Ignatius,spent all their spare time on this new activity. No one can say how or when it began–noteven Paulo can remember–but the two spent any free time during the week in the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"National Library reading books about such matters as ‘explosive propulsion’, ‘solidfuels’ and ‘metallic combustibles’. On Sundays and holidays, the small square in frontof the Coelho house became a launch pad. As was almost always the case with Paulo,everything had to be set down on paper first. In his usual meticulous way, he started asmall notebook entitled ‘Astronautics–Activities to be Completed by the Programmefor the Construction of Space Rockets’. Timetables stated the time taken on research inbooks, the specifications of materials used in the construction and the type of fuel. Onthe day of the launch, he produced a typewritten document with blank spaces to be filledin by hand at the time of the test, noting date, place, time, temperature, humidity andvisibility.The rockets were made of aluminium tubing about 20 centimetres in length andweighing 200 grams and had wooden nose cones. They were propelled by a fuel theboys had concocted out of ‘sugar, gunpowder, magnesium and nitric acid’. Thisconcentrated mixture was placed in a container at the base of the rocket, and theexplosive cocktail was detonated using a wick soaked in kerosene. The rockets weregiven illustrious names: Goddard I, II and III, and Von Braun I, II and III, in homage,respectively, to the American aeronautics pioneer Robert H. Goddard and the creator ofthe German flying bombs that devastated London during the Second World War,Werner von Braun. However, although the rockets were intended to rise up to 17 metres,they never did. On launch days, Paulo would take over a part of the pavement outsidetheir house ‘for the public’ and convert a hole that the telephone company had forgottento close up into a trench where he and his friend could shelter. He then invited hisfather, the servants and passers-by to sign the flight reports as ‘representatives of thegovernment’. The rockets failed to live up to the preparations. Not one ever rose morethan a few centimetres into the air and the majority exploded before they had even gotoff the ground. Paulo’s astronautical phase disappeared as fast as it had arrived and inless than six months the space programme was abandoned before a seventh rocket couldbe constructed.Apart from these fleeting fancies–stamp-collecting was another–Paulo continued tonurture his one constant dream–to become a writer. When he was sixteen, his father, ina conciliatory gesture, offered him a flight to Belém, which, to Paulo, was a paradise ona par with Araruama. Nevertheless, he turned it down, saying that he would rather havea typewriter. His father agreed and gave him a Smith Corona, which would stay withhim until it was replaced, first, by an electric Olivetti and, then, decades later, by alaptop computer.His total lack of interest in education meant that he was among the least successfulstudents in his class in the first year of his science studies and at the end of the year heonce again scraped through with a modest 5.2 average. His report arrived on ChristmasEve. Paulo never quite knew whether it was because of his dreadful marks or anargument over the length of his hair, but on Christmas Day 1963, when the first group"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"of relatives was about to arrive for Christmas dinner, his mother told him bluntly: ‘I’vemade an appointment for the 28th. I’m taking you to a nerve specialist.’Terrified by what that might mean–what in God’s name was a nerve specialist?–helocked himself in his room and scribbled a harsh, almost cruel account of hisrelationship with his family:I’m going to see a nerve specialist. My hands have gone cold with fear. But theanxiety this has brought on has allowed me to examine my home and those in itmore closely.Mama doesn’t punish me in order to teach me, but just to show how strongshe is. She doesn’t understand that I’m a nervous sort and that occasionally Iget upset, and so she always punishes me for it. The things that are intended tobe for my own good she always turns into a threat, a final warning, an exampleof my selfishness. She herself is deeply selfish. This year, she has never, orhardly ever, held my hand.Papa is incredibly narrow-minded. He is really nothing more than the housefinancier. Like Mama, he never talks to me, because his mind is always on thehouse and his work. It’s dreadful.Sônia lacks character. She always does what Mama does. But she’s notselfish or bad. The coldness I feel towards her is gradually disappearing.Mama is a fool. Her main aim in life is to give me as many complexes aspossible. She’s a fool, a real fool. Papa’s the same.The diary also reveals that the fear induced by the proposed visit to the specialist wasunjustified. A day after the appointment he simply mentions the visit along with otherunimportant issues:Yesterday I went to the psychiatrist. It was just to meet him. No importantcomment to make.I went to see the play Pobre Menina Rica, by Carlos Lyra and Vinicius deMoraes and then I had a pizza.I decided to put off my whole literary programme until 1965. I’m going towait until I’m a bit more mature.He managed to achieve the required grades to pass the year and, according to the rulesof the house, he therefore had the right to a holiday, which, this time, was to be inBelém. His holidays with his paternal grandparents, Cencita and Cazuza, had oneenormous advantage over those spent in Araruama. At a time when a letter could take"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"weeks to arrive and a long-distance phone call sometimes took hours if not days to putthrough, the distance–more than 3,000 kilometres–between Rio and Belém meant thatthe young man was beyond the control of his parents or from any surprise visits.Adventures that were unthinkable in Rio were routine in Belém: drinking beer, playingsnooker and sleeping out of doors with his three cousins, whose mother had died andwho were being brought up by their grandparents. Such was the excitement and bustleof life there that within the first few days of his holiday, he had lost his penknife, hiswatch, his torch and the beloved Sheaffer fountain pen he had bought with his prizemoney. One habit remained: no matter what time he went to bed, he devoted the lastthirty minutes before going to sleep to writing letters to his friends and reading theeclectic selection of books he had taken with him–books ranging from Erle StanleyGardner’s detective story The Case of the Calendar Girl, to the encyclical Pacem inTerris, published in March 1963 by Pope John XXIII (‘Reading this book is increasingmy understanding of society,’ he wrote).He filled his letters to friends with news of his adventures in Belém, but in hisletters to his father there was only one subject: money.You’ve never put your money to such good use as when you paid for this tripfor me. I’ve never had such fun. But if all the money you’ve spent on the trip isto produce real benefits, I need more cash. There’s no point in you spending140,000 on a trip if I’m not going to have fun. If you haven’t got any sparemoney, then no problem. But it isn’t right to spend all your money on the housewhile my short life passes me by.Belém appears to have been a city destined to provoke strong feelings in him. Threeyears before, on another trip there, he had at last had the chance to clarify a questionthat was troubling him: how were babies made? Earlier, he had plucked up the courageto ask Rui, a slightly older friend, but the reply, which was disconcertingly stark,appalled him: ‘Simple: the man puts his dick in the woman’s hole and when he comes,he leaves a seed in her stomach. That seed grows and becomes a person.’ He didn’tbelieve it. He couldn’t imagine his father being capable of doing something soperverted with his mother. As this was not something that could be written about in aletter, he waited for the holidays in Belém so that he could find out from an appropriateperson–his cousin, Fred, who as well as being older, was a member of the family,someone whose version he could trust. The first chance he had to speak to his cousinalone, he found a way of bringing the subject up and repeated the disgusting story hisfriend in Rio had told him. He almost had an asthma attack when he heard what Fredhad to say: ‘Your friend in Rio is right. That’s how it is. The man enters the woman anddeposits a drop of sperm in her vagina. That’s how everyone is made.’"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Paulo reacted angrily. ‘You’re only telling me that because you haven’t got amother and so you don’t have a problem with it. Can you really imagine your fatherpenetrating your mother, Fred? You’re out of your mind!’That loss of innocence was not the only shock Belém had in store for him. The cityalso brought him his first contact with death. Early on the evening of Carnival Saturday,when he arrived at his grandparents’ house after a dance at the Clube Tuna Luso, he wasconcerned to hear one of his aunts asking someone, ‘Does Paulo know?’ His grandfatherCazuza had just died unexpectedly of a heart attack. Paulo was extremely upset andshocked by the news, but he felt very important when he learned that Lygia and Pedro–since they were unable to get there in time–had named him the family’s representativeat his grandfather’s funeral. As usual, he preferred to keep his feelings to himself, in thenotes he made before going to sleep:Carnival Saturday, 8th FebruaryThis night won’t turn into day for old Cazuza. I’m confused and overwhelmedby the tragedy. Yesterday, he was laughing out loud at jokes and today he’ssilent. His smile will never again spread happiness. His welcoming arms, hisstories about how Rio used to be, his advice, his encouraging words–all over.There are samba groups and carnival floats going down the street, but it’s allover.That same night he wrote ‘Memories’, a poem in three long stanzas dedicated to hisgrandfather. The pain the adolescent spoke of in prose and verse appeared sincere, but itwas interwoven with other feelings. The following day, with his grandfather’s corpsestill lying in the drawing room, Paulo caught himself sinning in thought against chastityseveral times, when he looked at the legs of his female cousins, who were there at thewake. On the Sunday evening, Cazuza’s funeral took place–‘a very fine occasion’, hisgrandson wrote in his diary–but on Shrove Tuesday, during the week of mourning, thecousins were already out having fun in the city’s clubs.That holiday in Belém was not only the last he would spend there: it also proved tobe a watershed in his life. He knew he was going to have a very difficult year at school.He felt even more negative about his studies than he had in previous years; and it wasclear that his days at St Ignatius were numbered and equally clear that this would haveconsequences at home. There were not only dark clouds hanging over his school lifeeither. At the end of the month, the day before returning to Rio, he flipped back in hisdiary to the day when he had written of his grandfather’s death and wrote in tiny butstill legible writing: ‘I’ve been thinking today and I’ve begun to see the terrible truth:I’m losing my faith.’This was not a new feeling. He had experienced his first religious doubts–gnawing"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"away at him implacably and silently–during the retreat at St Ignatius when, troubled bysexual desire and tortured by guilt, he had been gripped by panic at the thought ofsuffering for all eternity in the apocalyptic flames described by Father Ruffier. He hadturned to his diary to talk to God in a defiant tone ill suited to a true Christian: ‘It wasYou who created sin! It’s Your fault for not making me strong enough to resist! Thefact that I couldn’t keep my word is Your fault!’ The following morning, he read thisblasphemy and felt afraid. In desperation, he took his fellow pupil Eduardo Jardim to aplace where they would not be seen or heard and broke his vow of silence to open up hisheart to him.His choice of confidant was a deliberate one. He looked up to Jardim, who wasintelligent, read a lot and was a good poet without being a show-off. A small group ofboys from St Ignatius to which Paulo belonged would meet in the garage at Jardim’shouse to discuss what each had been reading. But it was mostly the strength of Jardim’sreligious convictions that made him not only a good example but also the perfectconfidant for a friend with a troubled soul. Paulo told him that everything had startedwith one doubt: if God existed and if this God had created him in His own image andlikeness, then why did He delight in his suffering? As he asked these questions Paulohad arrived at the really big one–the unconfessable doubt: did God really exist? Fearingthat others might hear him, Jardim whispered, as though in the confessional, words thatwere like salt being rubbed into his friend’s wounds: ‘When I was younger and wasscared that my faith in God would disappear, I did everything I could to keep it. Iprayed desperately, took cold baths in winter, but my faith was very slowlydisappearing, until, finally, it disappeared completely. My faith had gone.’This meant that even Jardim had succumbed. The more Paulo tried to drive awaythis thought, the less he was able to rid his mind of that image of a small boy takingcold baths in the middle of winter just so that God would not disappear–and God simplyignoring him. That day Paulo Coelho hated God. And so that there would be no doubtregarding his feelings he wrote: ‘I know how dangerous it is to hate God.’A perfectly banal incident when he was returning from the retreat had soured hisrelations with God and His shepherds still more. On the way from the retreat house tothe school, Paulo judged that the driver of the bus was driving too fast and puttingeveryone’s life at risk. What started out merely as a concern became a horror movie: ifthe bus had an accident and he were to die, his soul would be burning in hell beforemidday. That fear won out over any embarrassment.He went to the front of the bus, where his spiritual guide was sitting, and said:‘Father Ruffier, the driver is driving too fast. And I’m terrified of dying.’Furious, the priest snarled at the boy: ‘You’re terrified of dying and I’m outragedthat you’re such a coward.’As time passed, Paulo’s doubts became certainties. He began to hate the priests (‘aband of retrogrades’) and all the duties, whether religious or scholastic, that they"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"imposed on the boys. He felt the Jesuits had deceived him. Seen from a distance,sermons he had once believed to contain solid truths were now remembered as ‘slowlyadministered doses of poison to make us hate living’, as he wrote in his diary. And hedeeply regretted ever having taken those empty words seriously. ‘Idiot that I was, I evenbegan to believe that life was worthless,’ he wrote, ‘and that with death alwayswatching, I was obliged to go to confession on a regular basis so as to avoid going tohell.’ After much torment and many sleepless nights, at almost seventeen years of age,Paulo knew that he no longer wanted to hear about church, sermons or sin. And hehadn’t the slightest intention of becoming a good student during his second year on thescience course. He was equally convinced that he would invest all his beliefs and energyin what he saw not as a vocation but as a profession–that of being a writer.One term was more than enough for everyone to realize that the college had lost allmeaning for him. ‘I have gone from being a bad pupil to being a dreadful pupil.’ Hisschool report shows that this was no exaggeration. He was always near the bottom of theclass, and he managed to do worse in each exam he sat. In the first monthly tests he gotan average of just over 5, thanks to a highly suspect 9 in chemistry. In May, his averagefell to 4.4, but alarm bells only started to ring in June, when his average fell to 3.7.That month, Pedro and Lygia were called to a meeting at the school and asked tobring his report book. The news they received could not have been worse. A priest readout the fifth article of the school rules, which all parents had to sign when their son wasadmitted to the school and in which it was stated that those who did not achieve theminimum mark required would be expelled. If Paulo continued along the same path, hewould undoubtedly fail and his subsequent expulsion from one of the most traditionalschools in the country would thereafter blot his scholastic record. There was only oneway to avoid expulsion and to save both student and parents from such ignominy. Thepriest suggested that they take the initiative and move their son at once to anotherschool. He went on to say that St Ignatius had never done this before. This exceptionwas being made in deference to the fact that the pupil in question was the grandson ofone of the first pupils at the college, Arthur Araripe Júnior, ‘Mestre Tuca’, who hadgone there in 1903.Pedro and Lygia returned home, devastated. They knew that their son smoked insecret and they had often smelled alcohol on his breath, and some relatives hadcomplained that he was becoming a bad example for the other children. ‘That boy’strouble,’ his aunts would whisper, ‘he’s going to end up leading all his younger cousinsastray.’ What, up until then, had been termed Paulo’s ‘strange behaviour’ was restrictedto the family circle. However, if he were to leave St Ignatius, even without beingexpelled, this would bring shame upon his parents and reveal them as having failed tobring him up properly. And if, as his father was always saying, a son was a reflection ofhis family, then the Coelhos had more than enough reason to feel that their image hadbeen tarnished. At a time when corporal punishment was commonplace among"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Brazilian parents, Pedro and Lygia had never lifted a hand against Paulo, but they wererigorous in the punishments they meted out. So when Pedro announced that he hadenrolled Paulo at Andrews College, where he would continue in the science stream, healso told his son that any future holidays were cancelled and that his allowance wastemporarily suspended–if he wanted money for cigarettes and beer he would have towork.If this was meant as a form of punishment, then it backfired, because Paulo lovedthe change. Andrews was not only a lay college and infinitely more liberal than StIgnatius but co-educational, which added a delightful novelty to the schoolday: girls.Besides this, there were political discussions, film study groups and even an amateurdrama group, which he joined before he even met any of his teachers. He had venturedinto the world of the theatre a year earlier, when, during the long end-of-year holiday,he had locked himself in his room, determined to write a play. He would only come outfor lunch and dinner, telling his parents that he was studying. After four days, hefinished The Ugly Boy, which he pretentiously referred to as ‘a petit guignol à la AluísioAzevedo’, a synopsis of which he recorded in his diary:In this play, I present the ugly person in society. It’s the story of a young manrejected by society who ends up committing suicide. The scenes are played outby silhouettes, while four narrators describe the feelings and actions of thecharacters. During the interval between the first and second acts, someone atthe back of the stalls sings a really slow bossa nova [a style of Brazilian musicthat has its roots in samba and cool jazz] whose words relate to the first act. Ithink it will work really well. This year it’s going to be put on at home in theconservatory.Fortunately, his critical sense won out over his vanity, and a week later, he tore up thisfirst incursion into play-writing and gave it a six-word epitaph: ‘Rubbish. I’ll writeanother one soon.’ And it was as a playwright (as yet unpublished) that he approachedthe amateur theatre group at Andrews College, known as Taca.As for schoolwork, teachers and exams, none of these seemed to have concernedhim. On the rare occasions when these topics merited a mention in his diary, he woulddismiss them with a short, usually negative sentence: ‘I’m doing badly at school, I’mgoing to fail in geometry, physics and chemistry’ ‘I can’t even get myself to pick up myschoolbooks: anything serves as a distraction, however stupid’ ‘Classes seem to getlonger and longer’ ‘I swear I don’t know what’s wrong with me, it’s beyonddescription.’ Admitting that he was doing badly at school was a way of hiding the truth:he was on the slippery slope.Up until October, two months before the end of the year, all his marks in every"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"subject had been below 5. His father thought that it was time to rein him in once and forall and carry out his earlier threat: his cousin, Hildebrando Góes Filho, found Paulowork in a dredging company that operated at the entrance to the port of Rio de Janeiro.The pay wasn’t even enough to cover Paulo’s travel and cigarettes. Every day aftermorning classes, he would rush home, have lunch and take a bus to Santo Cristo, an areaby the docks. A tugboat would take him over to the dredger, where he would spend therest of the day with a slate in his hand, making a cross each time the machine picked upthe rubbish from the seabed and deposited it in a barge. It seemed to him utterlypointless and reminded him of the Greek myth of Sisyphus, who is forced to push astone up to the top of a mountain only to have the stone roll back down to the bottom, sothat he has to begin his task all over again. ‘It’s never-ending,’ Paulo wrote in his diary.‘Just when I think it’s finished, it starts again.’The punishment had no positive result. He continued to do badly at school andwhen he knew he ran the risk of failing the whole year, he recorded the fact quiteshamelessly: ‘A friend has told me I’m going to be kept down in maths,’ he wrote. ‘Andmeanwhile the morning is so beautiful, so musical, that I’m even rather happy. Oh, God,what a life. What a life, what a life.’ At the end of the year, his report confirmed theexpected results: his final average of 4.2 meant that he had failed in every subject.Paulo seemed to be growing ever more indifferent to the world in which he foundhimself. He accepted uncomplainingly the work on the dredger and didn’t even carewhen all he received from his parents at Christmas was a penknife. The only thing thatinterested him was writing, whether in the form of novels, plays or poetry. He hadrecently returned to poetry and was writing furiously. After some thought, he hadconcluded that it was no disgrace to write verses if he was not yet ready to start writinghis novel. ‘I have so many things to write about! The problem is that I can’t get startedand I haven’t got the patience to carry on with it,’ he moaned, and went on: ‘All thesame, that is my chosen profession.’As he settled into the house in Gávea, he discovered that there were others amongthe young who were interested in books and literature. Since there were fifteen boys andgirls, they created a literary club, which they called Rota 15, the name Rota beingderived from Rua Rodrigo Otávio, which crossed Rua Padre Leonel Franca, wherePaulo’s house was, and at the corner of which they would all meet. Paulo’s poeticoutput was such that when Rota 15 decided to produce a mimeographed booklet ofpoetry he contributed an anthology of thirteen poems (among them the award-winning‘Thirteen-year-old-Woman’), and he added at the end his biography: ‘Paulo Coelhobegan his literary career in 1962, writing short articles, then moved on to poetry. Heentered a poem in the Academia Literária Santo Inácio in 1963 and in the same yearwon the top prize.’ Rota 15 collapsed amid scandal when Paulo accused the treasurer ofstealing the petty cash in order to go and see the French singer Françoise Hardy inconcert in Rio."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"He already believed himself to be a poet of sufficient standing not to have todepend any more on insignificant little magazines produced locally or by small groups.With the self-confidence of an old hand he felt that the time had come for him to flyhigher. His dream was to be praised for his work–a laudatory quote would workwonders–in the respected weekly literary column ‘Escritores e Livros’, produced byJosé Condé, from Pernambuco, in the newspaper Correio da Manhã. The waspishCondé, who was able to make or break reputations in one paragraph, was the jointauthor of Os Sete Pecados Capitais [The Seven Cardinal Sins], a collection published byCivilização Brasileira, the other authors being Guimarães Rosa, Otto Lara Resende,Carlos Heitor Cony and Lygia Fagundes Telles, among other equally important writers.Paulo admired Condé’s dry style and hoped that the critic’s sharp eye would perceivethe talent hidden in his work.He added new poems to the anthology published by Rota 15, typed it up and sent offthe carefully bound volume to the editors of Correio da Manhã. The followingWednesday, when ‘Escritores e Livros’ appeared, he rushed to the newspaper stand,desperate to read Condé’s opinion of his work. His surprise was such that he cut out thecolumn and stuck it in his diary, writing above it: ‘A week ago, I wrote to J. Condésending him my poetry and asking for his opinion. This is what appeared in thenewspaper today.’ The reason for his fury was a ten-line postscript at the foot of thewriter’s column: ‘To all young show-offs who are desperate to get themselves a nameand publish books, it would be worthwhile recalling the example of Carlos Drummondde Andrade, who only published three volumes totalling 144 poems in 15 years...Andonly the other day, a critic said that Ernest Hemingway rewrote that small masterpieceThe Old Man and the Sea no fewer than twenty times.’Paulo took this personally and felt crushed by such an aggressive response. Whileonly a short while before he had been thanking God for the joy of having discovered hisvocation, his self-confidence gave way to a sea of doubt. ‘Maybe I’m not cut out to be awriter,’ he wrote. But he soon recovered his self-belief. Like the friend who used to takecold baths in order not to lose faith in God, he had to fight to realize his dream. Condéhad dealt him a blow, but he was not prepared to lie down. He spent the whole daythinking of nothing but that literary column. In order to take his mind off it he triedwatching an episode of Dr Kildare, about a young doctor, played by RichardChamberlain, working in a large hospital. He switched off before the end and wrote inhis notebook: ‘In today’s episode of Dr Kildare, the director of the hospital says to thedoctor: “I shouldn’t have tried to change your life, Jim. We were all born with an ideal.”I’ve applied these words to being a writer and have decided that’s what I’ll be.’ Thrilledby his own determination, he wrote a parody of Kipling’s ‘If...’:If you can ask your friends and enemies for a chance.If you can hear a ‘no’ and take it as a ‘maybe’."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"If you can start from the bottom and yet still value the little that you have.If you can improve yourself each moment and reach the heights withoutsuccumbing to vanity.Then you’ll be a writer.Immersed in these lofty ideas, he viewed with horror the prospect of going back toAndrews College. Tormented by the mere thought of it, he dreamed up a plan which, ifit succeeded, would free him from school for a good two years: to get a study grant andleave the country, as several of his schoolfriends had done. His parents found renewedhope when he applied to join the American Field Service, a cultural exchangeprogramme that was much in vogue at the time. Judging by his marks, he wasn’tentirely useless at English (a subject in which, by his standards, he always did fairlywell), and that would certainly help in obtaining the grant. For two weeks, he dedicatedhis free time to getting together all the necessary documents: school certificates,passport-size photos, references. When the exams came around, the seven otherapplicants in his group for the one place were whittled down until there remained onlyPaulo and two others who were to take the decisive test–the interview in English withsomeone from the United States.On the day, he was so nervous that as he sat down in front of the examiner–a girlhis own age–he felt a jolt, as though he had been punched in the chest. He set aside hisatheism and silently begged God to let this be a false alarm. It was not: he was havingan asthma attack. A dry whistle rose from his lungs while, eyes bulging, he patted hispockets, searching for his inhaler. He tried to talk, but all that came out was a whisper.The American girl didn’t know what to do. After a few minutes, the attack subsided.Pulling himself together, he managed to complete the interview, but he left withmisgivings: ‘I think that asthma attack has ruined my chances.’ Indeed, a month beforehe would have been due to leave for the United States, a telegram arrived informing himthat he had not been selected. Instead of feeling downhearted at this failure, Pauloattributed it not to his poor performance but to the fact that his mother had visited theStates earlier. ‘I think they’d prefer people whose relatives have never been to theUnited States,’ he wrote, finishing with a statement worthy of the fox in the fable whenfaced with the bunch of grapes he cannot reach: ‘They believe, at least this is how Iinterpret it, that I’m too much of an intellectual for America.’It was at this time that a new, overwhelming passion entered his life: a flesh-and-blood passion with brown eyes and long legs and answering to the name of Márcia. Atseventeen, Paulo was still skinny and rather short, even by Brazilian standards. Heweighed 50 kilos, which was at least 10 kilos below the ideal for his height of 1.69metres (he remains this height to this day). Added to this, he was not an attractiveadolescent. ‘I was ugly, skinny, lacking in charm and incapable of getting a girlfriend,’he has said in various interviews throughout his life. ‘I had an inferiority complex about"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"the way I looked.’ While the majority of boys wore short-sleeved, close-fitting shirts, toshow off their muscles, he would always wear a long-sleeved shirt that concealed hisnarrow shoulders and thin arms. A disproportionately wide leather belt held up hisfaded jeans which, as fashion decreed, were tight on the legs. He wore the same metal-framed spectacles with tinted lenses that, years later, would become the trademark ofthe Beatle John Lennon. His hair was almost shoulder-length, and he had started tocultivate a thin moustache and a tuft of hair under his lower lip.Márcia was a year younger than Paulo and lived almost next door. She was also apupil at Andrews College and a member of Rota 15. In spite of vigilance on the part ofher parents and older brother, she was seen by her colleagues as a fun-loving girl andwas, therefore, in great demand. With his self-confidence at rock bottom, Paulo didn’teven notice her looking at him when he was arguing with the other ‘intellectuals’ in thegroup about films, books and plays. Although the majority of the group didn’t evenknow the meaning of the word, they almost all felt that they were ‘existentialists’. Paulonever wore smart clothes, he didn’t have a car and he wasn’t strong, but Márcia meltedwhenever she heard him talking about books or reciting famous poems. He, however,was oblivious to this until she took the initiative.On New Year’s Eve 1964, Paulo closed yet another notebook with the melancholywords: ‘Today is the last day of 1964, a year that’s coming to an end with a sob hiddenin the dark night. A year crowned with bitterness.’ And it was in this same downbeatmood that he met up with his friends two days later, on a Saturday, to go to the showOpinião, featuring the singer Nara Leão, at the Arena Theatre in Copacabana. The grouptook their seats and Márcia happened to sit next to him. When the lights dimmed andNara began to sing, Márcia felt something brush her hand. She glanced sideways andsaw Paulo’s hand lying close to hers. She immediately entwined her fingers in his andsqueezed lightly. He was so astonished that his first reaction was one of panic: what ifhe had an asthma attack right there? However, he calmed down. ‘I was certain that Godhad guided Márcia’s hand towards mine,’ he recalled later. ‘In that case, why would Hegive me an asthma attack?’ So he began to breathe like any mortal and the two felldesperately in love.When the show came to an end, Nara Leão gave several encores, but, still holdinghands, the young couple took advantage of the dark, and escaped from the crowdedtheatre. They took off their shoes and walked barefoot, hand-in-hand, along Copacabanabeach. Paulo put his arms around her and tried to kiss her, but Márcia pulled backgently, saying: ‘I’ve never been kissed on the mouth before.’He reacted like a veritable Don Juan: ‘Don’t worry. I’ve kissed lots of girls. You’lllike it.’In the suffocating heat and under the starry Rio night, the two liars shared a longkiss, which both would remember warmly more than forty years later. The year 1965could not have got off to a more encouraging start."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Paulo’s relationship with Márcia brought him a peace of mind he had never knownbefore, not even during the best times in Araruama and Belém. He wasn’t even upsetwhen he learned that he hadn’t been placed in a poetry competition held by the InstitutoNacional do Mate. ‘Who cares about prizes,’ he wrote magnanimously, ‘when they’reloved by a woman like Márcia?’ He now filled whole pages of his diary with drawingsof hearts pierced by love’s arrow and with their two names written on them.This happiness was short-lived. Before the summer was over, Márcia’s parentsfound out the name of her boyfriend, and they were adamant that he was not the one forher. And when she wanted to know the reason for this ban, her mother wasdisconcertingly frank: ‘In the first place he’s really ugly. I can’t understand what apretty girl like you could see in such an ugly, awkward boy. You’re someone who likesparties, and he doesn’t even know how to dance and would be embarrassed to ask a girlto dance. The only thing he’s interested in is books. Added to that, he looks rathersickly...’Márcia retorted that he was perfectly healthy. He had asthma, like millions ofothers, but it could be cured and certainly wasn’t a blot on his character. Her motherfeared that he might have other, contagious illnesses: ‘I’ve even been told that he’s anexistentialist and a communist. So we’re not going to discuss it any further.’For her daughter, the matter was far from being closed. She recounted the entireepisode to her boyfriend and the two decided to deal with the situation as best theycould. They began to meet secretly in the homes of mutual friends, but because therewere very few safe places, their intimate moments together were exceedingly rare andusually occurred in a pedalo on Lake Rodrigo de Freitas. Not that they ever went beyondthe preliminaries. Paulo pretended to be experienced, but in fact up until then he hadhad only one sexual relationship, some months earlier, when, taking advantage of hisparents’ absence, he had managed to convince Madalena, a pretty maid whom hismother had recently employed, to go up to his room with him. Although she was onlyeighteen, Madá–as she was known–was experienced enough for the boy to retain ahappy memory of that first night.When they learned that their daughter was still meeting ‘that creature’ behind theirbacks, Márcia’s parents increased their vigilance and refused to allow her to speak toPaulo on the phone. However, it was soon discovered that they had each put an alarmclock under their pillow to wake them at four in the morning when, in the silence of thenight, they could whisper words of love, their mouths pressed to the receiver. Thepunishment for this disobedience was still harsher: she was to remain in the house for amonth. Márcia refused to give up. With the help of the maid she would send notes to herboyfriend in which she would say when he should go and stand beneath the window ofher room, where she was shut away. One morning, she woke to find a declaration oflove scrawled in the tarmac in enormous letters: ‘M: I love you. P.’Márcia’s mother returned to the charge: Paulo wasn’t right for her, it wouldn’t"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"work out, he had no future and no prospects. The girl responded, undaunted, that shewould certainly not break up with her boyfriend. She planned to marry Paulo one day.On hearing this, one of her aunts suggested that a sickly boy like him might not have thephysical strength to fulfil his conjugal obligations. ‘You know what I’m talking about,don’t you, my dear,’ she went on. ‘Marriage, sex, children...Do you think that, weak ashe is, he’ll be able to lead a normal life?’ Márcia appeared unconcerned by such threats.As soon as she had served her term of punishment, she went back to meeting Paulo.They had discovered an ideal spot: the church of Our Lady of the Conception, whichwas close to both their houses. They never sat next to each other, but one would sit infront of the other so that they wouldn’t arouse suspicion, and there they would talk inwhispers. Despite all their precautions, they were caught by Márcia’s father, whodragged her home screaming and punished her by beating her with a belt.She, however, seemed firmly determined to love, become engaged to and marry herPrince Charming. His parents weren’t over-enthusiastic about their son’s choice either.Since it was usual for his friends to hold small parties in their homes, Paulo managed topersuade his parents to allow him to hold one in theirs. It was a disaster. When they sawtheir son dancing cheek-to-cheek with his girlfriend, his father stood, arms crossed,beside them, staring angrily until Márcia, embarrassed, moved away and joined a groupof girlfriends. And he did the same with Paulo’s other guests. If he saw a boy and girldancing too close or with the boy’s hand below the girl’s waist, he would stand rightnext to them until they ‘showed some manners’. In addition, the master of the house hadforbidden all alcohol, even an innocent beer.This was the first and last party held in the Coelhos’ large pink house. But nothingcould shake Paulo’s happiness. Márcia’s birthday was approaching, and their love wasnot yet two months old, when her mother suggested they have a talk. Not being abeliever in corporal punishment, she tried another tack: ‘If you break up with him, youcan go to the best boutique in Rio and buy all the clothes you want.’ Her mother knewher daughter’s weak spot: vanity. Márcia’s initial reaction was that the suggestion wasunacceptable–‘downright blackmail’. However, after some reflection, she decided thatshe had more than proved her love and that they both knew that they couldn’t pursuetheir love against their parents’ wishes. They were both under age and dependent–therewas no future in it. If she had to give in, then at least it was at a good price. Sheaccepted. When he read Márcia’s letter telling him that their romance was over, Pauloburst into tears and wrote of his frustration: ‘For someone like me, who dreamed oftransforming Gávea into a Brazilian Verona, there could be no sadder end than beingthrown over for a couple of dresses.’Abandoned by his Great Love–as he described Márcia in his diary–he once againfell into depression. His parents were concerned about his state of mind and, taking pityon him, they decided to make an exception. Although holidays in Araruama had beenforbidden because of his failure at Andrews College, he would be allowed to spend"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Carnival there with his cousins. Paulo arrived by bus on the Friday night and spent theweekend feeling miserable, not even wanting to go and see the girls at the dances in thecity. On the following Monday evening, he accepted an invitation from three friends tohave a beer in a bar near his Uncle José’s house.When the table was covered in beer mats, showing how many drinks had beenconsumed, one of the boys, Carlinhos, had an idea: ‘My parents are away and the car isin the garage just waiting to be taken out. If any of you knows how to drive we can gofor a spin round the town.’Although he had never driven a car, Paulo announced: ‘I can drive.’They paid the bill, went to Carlinhos’s house and took the car. While the four ofthem were driving up the main street, where there were crowds of people and carnivalparades, there was a general power failure. Although it was pitch dark, Paulo drove onthrough the mêlée of pedestrians and carnival-goers. Suddenly he saw a group ofrevellers in carnival costumes making their way towards the car.Not knowing how to react, he swerved and accelerated. Then one of his friendsyelled: ‘Watch out for the boy!’It was too late. They all felt something hit the car’s front bumper, but Paulo wenton accelerating while his friends looked back, terrified, shouting: ‘Put your foot down,Paulo! Put your foot down! Get out of here! You’ve killed the boy!’"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5First encounter with Dr BenjamimTHE BOY WAS LUÍS CLÁUDIO, or Claudinho, the son of a tailor, Lauro Vieira de Azevedo.He was seven years old and lived in Rua Oscar Clark, near the house where Paulo wasstaying. The violence of the collision was such that the boy was thrown some distance,with his stomach ripped open and his intestines exposed. He was taken unconscious tothe Casa de Caridade, the only hospital in Araruama, where it was found that the blowhad ruptured his spleen. To control the haemorrhaging the doctor in A&E gave him ablood transfusion, but Claudinho experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure andnearly died.After the collision, Paulo and his friends had not only failed to go to Claudinho’said but also fled the scene of the accident. They took the car back to Carlinhos’s houseand, with the city still in darkness, went to the home of another of the boys who hadbeen in the car, Maurício. On their way there, they realized that news of the accidentwas spreading. Terrified by rumours that the boy had died, they made a pact of silence:no one would ever utter a word about the incident. They all went their separate ways. Inorder not to arouse suspicion, when Paulo arrived at his uncle’s home, he ‘cynically’(his own word) acted as though nothing had happened. However, half an hour later camethe moment of truth: Maurício and Aurélio, the fourth member of the group, had beennamed by a witness and arrested, and while in police custody they revealed the identityof the driver.Paulo’s uncle took him to a room and told him of the gravity of the situation: ‘Theboy’s life is hanging by a thread. We must just hope that he survives, because if he dies,things will get very ugly for you. Your parents have been told everything and they’re ontheir way from Rio to talk to the police and the magistrate. Meanwhile, you’re notleaving the house. You’re safe here.’His uncle knew what the tailor was like and was concerned that he might dosomething crazy. His fears were confirmed that night. After visiting his dying son inhospital, Lauro appeared at the gates of the house where Paulo was hiding, along withtwo unpleasant-looking men. A revolver stuck in his belt, Lauro wagged a finger at Joséand said: ‘Dr Araripe, we don’t know yet whether Claudinho will live or die. As long asthat’s the case, your nephew is not to leave Araruama. And if my son dies, Paulo willdie too, because I’ll come here personally and kill him.’Late that night, Lygia and Pedro arrived in Araruama and, even before going to seetheir son, they went to the magistrate’s house, who told them that the ‘perpetrator’"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"could only leave the city with his permission. His parents’ arrival did nothing toalleviate Paulo’s despair and he spent a sleepless night. Lying in bed, he wrote in atremulous hand:This is the longest day of my life. I feel terrible, not knowing how the child is.But the worst thing was when we arrived at Maurício’s house, after theaccident, and everyone was saying that the boy was dead. I wanted to run away,to disappear. I can’t think of anything but you, Márcia. I’m going to be chargedwith driving without a licence. And if the child’s condition worsens, I’ll betried and might be sent to prison.This was hell on earth. On Shrove Tuesday news of the two incidents–the accident andthe tailor’s threat–had spread rapidly, drawing inquisitive crowds to Rua Oscar Clark,eager to witness the climax to the drama. Early on, Lygia and Pedro decided to visitClaudinho’s parents to offer their apologies and to get news of the boy’s condition, forClaudinho was still unconscious. Lygia put together a large basket of fruit for the boy’smother to take to him. As she and her husband were approaching the house, which wason the same side of the road as José’s, Lauro ordered them to turn back, because he wasnot prepared to talk. He repeated his threat–‘Your son will only leave this town if myson survives’–and he said that Lygia could take the fruit back: ‘No one here is dying ofhunger. I don’t want charity, I want my son back.’Paulo left his room only to ask for news of the boy. He recorded each piece ofinformation in his notebook:They went to the hospital this morning. The boy’s temperature is going down,let’s hope that his father withdraws his complaint to the police.[...] The whole town knows everything and I can’t leave the house becausethey’re out looking for me. I heard that yesterday, at the dance, there was adetective waiting for me at the door.[...] The boy’s temperature has gone up again.[...] It looks as though I might be arrested at any moment, becausesomeone told the police I’m over eighteen. Everything depends on the boy.Claudinho’s temperature rose and fell several times. He regained consciousness on theWednesday morning, two days after the accident, but it wasn’t until late that night thatthe agony ended, when the doctors reported that he was out of danger and would bedischarged in a few days.Early on the Thursday, Pedro Coelho took his son to make a statement to the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"magistrate, who had him sign an agreement to pay all the medical and hospitalexpenses. The boy survived and suffered no long-term consequences, apart from anenormous scar on his abdomen that would remain with him for life. Destiny, however,appears to have decided that his meeting with death was to be on Carnival Monday, forthirty-four years later, on 15 February 1999–another Carnival Monday–Luís Cláudio, bythis time a businessman, and married with two daughters, was dragged from his housein Araruama by two masked men with guns, who were apparently in the pay of a groupof hijackers of transport lorries. He was viciously tortured, then tied up, soaked inpetrol, set alight and burned to death.Claudinho’s survival in 1965 did nothing to improve Pedro Coelho’s mood. WhenPaulo returned to Rio, he heard that, as a punishment for having caused the accident andfor having lied, he would not be allowed out at night for a month. Added to this, hisallowance, which he had regained after leaving his job on the dredger in December, wasonce again to be stopped until he had repaid his father the 100,000 cruzeiros (someUS$1,750 in today’s terms) for the hospital fees.Two months after the beginning of term, the first report from Andrews Collegerevived the hopes of the Coelho family: although he had done badly in some subjects,their son had received such good marks in Portuguese, philosophy and chemistry thathis average had risen to 6.1, which may have been only so-so, but was certainly animprovement for someone who hadn’t even been able to manage a 5. Everyone washopeful: but in his second report, his average dropped to 4.6 and in the third he managedonly 2.5. The days when the reports arrived became days of retribution for Paulo. PedroCoelho would rant and rave, take away more of Paulo’s privileges and threaten evenworse punishments. Paulo, however, appeared indifferent to all of this. ‘I’m fed up withschool,’ he would tell his friends. ‘I’ll leave as soon as I can.’He channelled all the energy and enthusiasm he failed to put into his schoolworkinto the idea of becoming a writer. Unwilling to accept the fact that he was not yet afamous author, and convinced of his own talent, he had decided that his problem couldbe summed up in four words: a lack of publicity. At the beginning of 1965, he wouldtake long walks with his friend Eduardo Jardim along Copacabana beach, during whichhe would ponder what he called ‘the problem of establishing myself as a recognizedwriter’.His argument was a simple one: with the world becoming more and morematerialistic (whether through communism or capitalism, it made no difference), thenatural tendency was for the arts to disappear and, with them, literature. Only publicitycould save them from a cultural Armageddon. His main preoccupation was with thewritten word, as he frequently explained to Jardim. Since it wasn’t as widelydisseminated as music, literature was failing to find fertile ground among the young. ‘Ifsomeone doesn’t enthuse this generation with a love of literature,’ he would tell hisfriend, ‘it won’t be around much longer.’ To conclude, he revealed the secret of success:"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"‘That’s why publicity is going to be the main element in my literary programme. AndI’m going to control it. I’m going to use publicity to force the public to read and judgewhat I write. That way my books will sell more, but, more importantly, I’ll arousepeople’s curiosity about my ideas and theories.’ In spite of Jardim’s look ofastonishment when he heard this, Paulo continued with his plans for the final phase ofhis conquest of the reading public: ‘Then, like Balzac, I shall write articles under apseudonym both attacking and defending my work, but that’s a different matter.’Jardim did not appear to agree with anything he was hearing: ‘You’re thinking likea businessman, Paulo. Remember, publicity is an artificial thing that forces people to dowhat they don’t want.’Paulo was so convinced of the effectiveness of his ideas, though, that he had stuckto his desk at home a summary of the tasks he would have to carry out during that yearin order to achieve fame:Literary programme for the Year 1965Buy all the Rio newspapers each day of the week.Check the book reviews, who writes them and the names of the editors of thepapers.Send articles to the relevant people and a covering note to the editors.Telephone them, asking when the article will appear. Tell the editors whatmy ambitions are.Find contacts for publication.Repeat this process for magazines.Find out whether anyone who has received my texts would like to receive themon a regular basis.Repeat the same process with radio stations. Send my own proposal for aprogramme or send contributions to current programmes. Contact therelevant people by phone, asking when my contribution will be transmitted,if it is.Find out the addresses of famous writers and write to them sending my poetryand asking for their comments and for help in placing them in the papersthey write for. Write again if there’s no reply.Go to all book signings, lectures, first nights of plays, and try to get talkingwith the big names and get myself noticed.Organize productions of plays I’ve written and invite people belonging to theliterary circle of the older generation, and get their ‘patronage’.Try to get in touch with the new generation of writers, hold drinks parties, go toplaces where they go. Continue with my internal publicity campaign,keeping my colleagues informed of my triumphs."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The plan seemed infallible, but the truth is that Paulo continued to be humiliatingly,painfully unknown. He didn’t manage to get anything published; he didn’t get to knowany critics, journalists or anyone who could open a door for him or reach out a hand tohelp him up the ladder of success. To make matters worse, he continued to do badly inhis studies and was clearly miserable at having to go to college every day–what was thepoint when his marks went from bad to worse? He spent the days in a state ofabstraction, as if his mind were in another world.It was during this state of lethargy that he got to know another boy at school, JoelMacedo, who was studying classics. They were the same age, but Joel was the oppositeof Paulo: he was extroverted and politically articulate, and one of the youngestmembers of the so-called Paissandu generation–film-lovers and intellectuals who wouldmeet at the old-fashioned Paissandu cinema in the Flamengo district. He was a culturalactivist, led the Taca drama group and was responsible for Agora, a small newspaperpublished by the pupils of the college, whose editorial team he invited Paulo to join.The newspaper was at loggerheads with the conservative directors of the collegebecause it criticized the arrests and other arbitrary measures taken by the militarygovernment.A new world opened up to Paulo. Joining the Paissandu set meant rubbing shoulderswith Rio’s intellectual elite and seeing close to the leading lights of the left-wingopposition. The cinema and the two nearby bars–the Oklahoma and the Cinerama–attracted film directors, musicians, playwrights and influential journalists. The latestEuropean films were shown at midnight sessions on a Friday, when the 700 availabletickets sold out in minutes. Paulo wasn’t much interested in political or socialproblems, but his deep existential anxieties fitted the profile of the typical denizen ofPaissandu and he quickly made himself at home.One day, he was forced to confess to Joel why he never went to the midnight filmsessions, which were, after all, the most popular ones. ‘Firstly because I’m not yeteighteen and the films shown there are usually banned for minors,’ he explained,adding: ‘And if I get home after eleven o’clock my father won’t open the door to me.’Joel couldn’t accept that someone of seventeen had a set time for getting home. ‘Thetime has come for you to demand your freedom. The problem of your age is easyenough to solve: all you have to do is change your date of birth on your student card, asI did.’ He also offered to solve the problem of the curfew: ‘After the midnight sessionsyou can sleep in my parents’ house in Ipanema.’ From then on, with his card dulyfalsified and a guaranteed roof over his head, Paulo was free to enter the enchantedworld of Jean-Luc Godard, Glauber Rocha, Michelangelo Antonioni, Ingmar Bergmanand Roberto Rossellini.However, one problem remained: tickets, beer, cigarettes and travel all cost money.Not a fortune, obviously, but with his allowance suspended he didn’t have a penny to hisname, nor any idea as to how to get some money. To his surprise, a partial solution"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"came from his father. Pedro was a friend of Luís Eduardo Guimarães, the editor of theDiário de Notícias, which, at the time, was an influential newspaper in Rio. Guimarãeswas also the son-in-law of its owner, Ondina Dantas. Pedro fixed up a meeting betweenhis son and the journalist, and a few days later Paulo began to work as a cub reporter.The work, alas, would be unpaid until he was given a proper contract. The problem ofmoney remained, therefore, but there was one compensation: the job was a step towardsliberating himself from parental control. He was almost never at home. He would go outin the morning to college, return home briefly for lunch, then spend the afternoon at thenewspaper office and the evening at the Paissandu. He spent so many nights at Joel’sparents’ apartment that it became his second home.As is the case with all publications, the least exciting tasks fell to the juniors, suchas reporting on any potholes that were holding up the flow of traffic or any domesticarguments that ended up at the police station, or compiling lists of the dead in thepublic hospitals for the deaths section in the next day’s edition. It was not unusual forthe new boy to arrive at the office and be told by Silvio Ferraz, the chief reporter at theDiário de Notícias: ‘Go and talk to shopkeepers to see whether business is sufferingfrom the downturn.’ He may have been earning nothing and dealing only withunimportant matters, but Paulo felt he was an intellectual, someone who wrote everyday, no matter about what. There was also another great advantage. When his colleaguesat college or someone from the Paissandu set asked what he was doing, he would say:‘I’m a journalist. I write for the Diário de Notícias.’He was so busy with the newspaper, the cinema and amateur dramatics that he hadless and less time left for Andrews College. His father was in despair when hediscovered that, at the end of April, his son had an average of 2.5 (contributed to by azero in Portuguese, English and chemistry), but Paulo seemed to be living in anotherworld. He did exactly what he wanted to and came home at night when he wanted. If hefound the door unlocked, he would go in. If his father had, as he usually did, carefullylocked everything up at eleven, he would simply take the Leblon–Lapa bus and, minuteslater, be sleeping in Joel’s house. His parents didn’t know what else they could do.In May, a friend asked him for a favour: he wanted a job in the Crédito Real deMinas Gerais bank and needed two references. As this was the bank where Paulo’sfather had an account, perhaps he could be persuaded to write one of the necessaryletters? Paulo promised to see to it, but when he brought up the subject with his fatherhe received a blunt refusal: ‘Absolutely not! Only you could possibly think that I wouldsupport your vagrant friends.’Upset and too ashamed to tell his friend the truth, Paulo made a decision: he lockedhimself in his room and typed up a letter full of praise for the applicant, adding at thebottom ‘Engenheiro Pedro Queima Coelho de Souza’. He signed it and put the letter inan envelope–problem solved. Everything went so well that the subject of the letter feltobliged to thank its writer for his kindness with a telephone call. Dr Pedro couldn’t"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"understand what the boy was talking about: ‘Letter? What letter?’ On hearing the words‘bank manager’, he said: ‘I wrote no letter! Bring that letter here. Bring it hereimmediately! This is Paulo’s doing! Paulo must have forged my signature!’ He rang offand rushed to the bank, looking for evidence of the crime–the letter, the proof that hisson had become a forger, a fraudster. Paulo arrived home that evening, unaware of whathad happened. He found his father in a fury, but that was nothing new. Before going tosleep, he wrote a short note in his diary: ‘In a month and a half I’ve written nine articlesfor Diário de Notícias. I’ve got a trip to Furnas set up for 12th June, when I’m going tomeet the most important people in the political world, such as the president, the mostimportant governors and ministers of state.’The following morning, he woke in a particularly good mood, since a rumour hadbeen going round at the newspaper that he was going to be taken on officially, whichwould mean he would be a real journalist, with a press card and a guaranteed salary.When he went downstairs, he was surprised to find his parents already up and waitingfor him. Pedro was beside himself with rage, but he said nothing.It was Lygia who spoke: ‘Paulo, we’re worried about your asthma and so we’vemade an appointment with the doctor for a check-up. Eat your breakfast because we’vegot to leave soon.’A few minutes later, his father took the Vanguard out of the garage–a rareoccurrence–and the three drove along the coast road towards the city centre. Seated inthe back, absorbed in thought, Paulo gazed out at the fog over the sea, which madeGuanabara bay look simultaneously melancholy and poetic. When they were halfwayalong Botafogo beach the car took a left turn into Rua Marquês de Olinda, drove anotherthree blocks and drew up alongside a wall more than 3 metres high. The three got outand went over to a wrought-iron gate. Paulo heard his father say something to thegatekeeper and, moments later, saw a nun arrive to take them to a consulting room.They were in the Casa de Saúde Dr Eiras, a large hospital occupying various buildingsand large mansions in the woods at the bottom of a hill.The nun went ahead, showing his parents the way, with Paulo behind, notunderstanding what was going on. The four of them took a lift to the ninth floor and, asthey walked down a long corridor towards the consulting room, the nun opened a doorand showed Pedro and Lygia a bedroom with two beds and a window with an iron grille.She smiled, saying: ‘This is where the boy will sleep. As you can see, it’s a nice bright,spacious room.’Paulo couldn’t understand what he was hearing and had no time to ask, since, bythen, they were all in the doctor’s consulting room. Seated behind a desk was thepsychiatrist Dr Benjamim Gaspar Gomes, a fifty-two-year-old man, bald, with smalleyes and a pleasant face.Astonished, Paulo turned to his parents: ‘If I’ve just come here for asthma tests,why have you booked a room for me?’"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Pedro said nothing and Lygia gently tried to explain to her son that he was beingadmitted to an asylum. ‘You’re not going to school any more, and you’re not going tosleep at home. You left St Ignatius so that you wouldn’t be expelled and you’ve endedup failing at Andrews. On top of that you ran over the boy in Araruama...’Then his father spoke for the first time: ‘This time, you’ve really overstepped themark. Forging a signature, as you did mine, isn’t just a prank–it’s a crime.’Things moved rapidly from then on. His mother said that she and his father had hada long talk with Dr Benjamim–a colleague of Pedro’s and a person whom the familytrusted implicitly–and that they were all agreed that he was too excitable and neededmedication, so it would be a good idea for him to spend a few days in this ‘rest home’.Before he could recover from the shock, his parents stood up, said goodbye anddisappeared down the tiled corridor.Suddenly he found himself alone, locked up in an asylum with his school file underhis arm and a jacket over his shoulders, not knowing what to do. As though he thought itmight still be possible to escape from this nightmare, he said to the doctor: ‘You meanyou’re going to lock me up like a madman without examining me–no interview,nothing?’Dr Benjamim smiled: ‘You’re not being admitted as a madman. This is a rest home.You’re just going to take some medicine and rest. Besides, I don’t need to interviewyou, I have all the information I need.’No one with any common sense would think that the information given by Paulo’sfather could justify this treatment: his parents’ complaints–that he was irritable, hostile,a bad student and ‘even politically opposed to his father’–were not very different fromthe complaints that nine out of ten parents make about their adolescent children. Hismother had more precise concerns and thought that her son ‘had problems of a sexualnature’. The three reasons for this suspicion are surprising, coming as they do from anintelligent and sophisticated woman like Lygia: her son had no girlfriends, he hadrefused circumcision to correct an overtight foreskin–phimosis–and, finally, it seemed,lately, that his breasts were developing like those of a girl. There was, in fact, anexplanation for all of these ‘symptoms’, including the change in his breasts, which wasnothing more than the side effect of a growth hormone prescribed by a doctor to whomshe herself had taken him.The only problem of a psychiatric nature that might have concerned his parents wasone of which they were in fact unaware. Some months earlier, during one of his manysleepless, anxiety-filled nights, he had decided to kill himself. He went into the kitchenand began to block all the air vents with sticky tape and dusters. However, when it cameto turning on the gas inlet from the street to the oven, his courage failed him. He sawwith sudden clarity that he didn’t want to die: he only wanted his parents to notice hisdespair. He describes how, as he removed the last strip of tape from behind the door andstarted to go back to his room, he realized, terrified, that he had company: it was the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Angel of Death. There was good reason for his panic, since he had read somewhere that,once summoned to Earth, the Angel never left empty-handed. He recorded theconclusion to this macabre encounter in his diary:I could sense the smell of the Angel all around me, the Angel’s breath, theAngel’s desire to take someone away. I remained silent and silently asked whathe wanted. He told me that he had been summoned and that he needed to takesomeone, to give an account of his work. Then I picked up a kitchen knife,jumped over the wall and landed in an empty plot of land where the people inthe shanty towns kept their goats running free. I grabbed hold of one of themand slit its throat. The blood spurted up and went right over the wall,splattering the walls of my house. But the Angel left satisfied. From then on, Iknew that I would never try to kill myself again.Unless his parents had been so indiscreet as to read his diary–as he suspected some timelater–the sacrifice of the goat, which at the time was attributed to some perverse evil-doer, could not have been one of their reasons for having him admitted to the asylum.Still absorbing the shock of this new situation, Paulo was led to his room by a malenurse. As he leaned against the iron bars at the window, he was surprised by the beautyto be found in such a wretched place. From the ninth floor he had an unbroken view ofthe white sands of Botafogo beach, the Flamengo gardens and, in the background, thespectacular outline of Morro da Urca and Pão de Açucar. The bed beside his was empty,which meant that he would have to suffer his torment alone. In the afternoon, someonearrived from his house and handed over at the gate a suitcase with clothes, books andpersonal possessions. The day passed without incident.Lying on his bed, Paulo thought of the options open to him: the first, of course, wasto continue with his plan to be a writer. If this didn’t work out, the best thing would beto go mad as a convenient means to an end. He would be supported by the state, hewouldn’t have to work any more nor take on any responsibilities. This would meanspending a lot of time in psychiatric institutions, but, after a day wandering thecorridors, he realized that the patients at the clinic didn’t behave ‘like the mad peopleyou see in Hollywood films’: ‘Except for some pathological cases of a catatonic orschizophrenic nature, all the other patients are perfectly capable of talking about lifeand having their own ideas on the subject. Sometimes they have panic attacks, crises ofdepression or aggression, but they don’t last for long.’Paulo spent the following days trying to get to know the place to which he had beenconfined. Talking to the nurses and employees, he discovered that 800 mentally illpeople were interned at the clinic, and divided up according to the degree of theirinsanity and social class. The floor he was on was for the so-called ‘docile mad’ and"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"those referred by private doctors, while the remainder, the ‘dangerously mad’ and thosedependent on public health services, were in another building. The former slept inrooms with a maximum of two beds and a private bathroom and during the day theycould move freely around the entire floor. However, you could only take the lift, thedoors of which were locked, when accompanied by a nurse and a guide nominated by adoctor. All the windows, balconies and verandahs were protected by iron grilles or wallsmade of decorative air bricks through which one could still see. Those being paid for bysocial services slept in dormitories of ten, twenty and even thirty beds, while thoseconsidered to be violent were kept in solitary confinement.The Dr Eiras clinic was not only an asylum, as Paulo had originally thought, but agroup of neurological, cardiological and detox clinics for alcoholics and drug addicts.Two of its directors, the doctors Abraão Ackerman and Paulo Niemeyer, were amongthe most respected neurosurgeons in Brazil. While hundreds of workers dependent onsocial security lined up at their doors waiting for a consultation, famous people withhealth problems also went there. During his time in the clinic as a patient, Pauloreceived weekly visits from his mother. On one of these visits, Lygia arrivedaccompanied by Sônia Maria, who was fifteen at the time and had insisted on going tosee her brother in hospital. She left in a state of shock. ‘The atmosphere washorrendous, people talking to themselves in the corridors,’ she was to recall angrilysome years later. ‘And lost in that hell was Paulo, a mere boy, someone who shouldnever have been there.’ She left determined to speak to her parents, to beg them to opentheir hearts and remove her brother from the asylum, but she lacked the courage to doso. If she was unable to argue in defence of her own rights, what could she do for him?Unlike Paulo, Sônia spent her life in submission to her parents–to such a point that,even when married and a mother, she would never smoke in front of her father andconcealed from him the fact that she wore a bikini.As for Paulo’s suffering, this, according to Dr Benjamim, who visited him eachmorning, was not as bad as it might have been, thanks to ‘a special way he had ofgetting himself out of difficult situations, even when he was protesting against beinginterned!’ According to the psychiatrist, ‘the fact that Paulo did not suffer more isbecause he had a way with words’. And it was thanks to that ‘way with words’ that heavoided being subjected to a brutal treatment frequently inflicted on the mentally ill atthe clinic: electroshock treatment. Although he was well informed about mentalillnesses and had translated books on psychiatry, Dr Benjamim was a staunch defenderof electroconvulsive therapy, which had already been condemned in a large part of theworld. ‘In certain cases, such as incurable depression, there is no alternative,’ he wouldsay confidently. ‘Any other therapy is a cheat, an illusion, a palliative and a dangerousprocrastination.’ However, while he was a patient, Paulo was subjected to such heavydoses of psychotropic substances that he would spend the whole day in a daze,slouching along the corridor in his slippers. Although he had never experimented with"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"drugs, not even cannabis, he spent four weeks consuming packs and packs of medicationthat was supposedly detoxifying, but only left him more confused.Since almost no one knew he was in the asylum, he had little news of his friends.One day, he had an unexpected visit from the friend who was indirectly responsible forhis presence there by asking for a reference, and who left the clinic with a mad idea–never carried out: that of rallying the members of the defunct Rota 15 group to kidnaphim. However, Paulo’s tortured soul only found true peace when his latest loveappeared: Renata Sochaczewski, a pretty girl whom he had met at an amateur theatricalgroup, who was to become a great actress under the name Renata Sorrah, and whomPaulo affectionately called ‘Rennie’ or ‘Pato’. When she failed to get in to visit him,Renata would furtively send him little love notes. These contained such messages as‘Stand at the window because I’m waiting to wave goodbye to you’, or ‘Write a list ofwhat you want and give it to me on Friday. Yesterday I phoned but they didn’t tell you.’When he was allowed out, four weeks after being admitted, Paulo was in a veryfragile state, but he nevertheless tried to take a positive lesson from his journey intohell. It was only when he got home that he found the mental energy to make notes in hisdiary:In the meantime, I’ve been in Casa de Saúde Dr Eiras, where I was admitted forbeing maladjusted. I spent twenty-eight days there, missed classes, lost my joband was released as if I had been cured, even though there was no reason formy ever having been admitted in the first place. My parents have really done itthis time! They ruin my chances at the newspaper, ruin my academic year andspend loads of money only to find that there was nothing wrong with me. WhatI have to do now is start all over again, accepting what’s happened as a jokeand a well-intentioned mistake. (The worst of it is that the day I was admitted, Iwas going to be given a job on the permanent staff at the newspaper.)All the same, it was OK. As a patient on my floor said, ‘All experiences aregood experiences, even the bad ones.’ Yes, I’ve learned a lot. It gave me achance to mature and gain in self-confidence, to make a more careful study ofmy friends and notice things I’d never really thought about before. Now I’m aman.While Paulo may have left the clinic convinced that there was nothing wrong with him,this was not the opinion of the psychiatrist Dr Benjamim Gomes. The hospital file in thearchives of the clinic held a dark prognosis that read more like a condemnation: ‘Apatient with schizoid tendencies, averse to social and loving contact. He prefers solitaryactivities. He is incapable of expressing his feelings or of experiencing pleasure.’Judging from this piece of paper, Paulo’s suffering was only just beginning."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6Batatinha’s débutTHE FEW FRIENDS WHO HAD WITNESSED Paulo’s twenty-eight days of suffering in theclinic were surprised when he was let out. Although physically exhausted and lookingmore fragile, he made no attempt to hide the fact that he had been admitted to anasylum. On the contrary, when he reappeared in Rua Rodrigo Otávio, he boasted to acircle of friends that he had lived through an experience unknown to any of them: beingtreated as a madman. His descriptions of the people and events at the clinic, many ofthem invented, were so extraordinary that some of his friends even expressed envy atnot having been in such an interesting place.Lygia and Pedro were concerned about their son’s behaviour. Fearing that hisconfinement might stigmatize him at school and at work, they treated the matter withtotal discretion. His father had decided to tell Andrews College and the Diário deNotícias that Paulo’s absence was due to his having to go away unexpectedly. Whenthey learned that their son was telling everyone the truth, Pedro warned him: ‘Don’t dothat. If people get to know that you’ve had mental problems, you’ll never be able tostand as a candidate for President of the Republic.’Not having the least desire to be president of anything at all, Paulo appeared to havereturned from the clinic with a renewed appetite for what he called ‘the intellectuallife’. Now he had a new place where he could hang out, besides the amateur theatre atthe college and the Cine Paissandu. The director of the Serviço Nacional de Teatro(SNT), Bárbara Heliodora, had got permission from the government to transform theold headquarters of the Students’ Union (which had been ransacked and burned byextreme right-wing groups on the day of the military coup) into the new NationalDrama Conservatory. Without restoring the building or painting over the marks left bythe damage caused by the vandals, the Centro Popular de Cultura, as it had been known,was turned into the Teatro Palcão, a 150-seat theatre which, although it didn’t enjoy thefreedom it had previously enjoyed, would once again become a centre of cultural debatepermanently filled by workshops, rehearsals and drama group productions. What wouldlater become the Teatro Universitário Nacional (National University Theatre), anoccasional drama group comprising only students, was also born there. Paulo’s soleexperience in this area was his play The Ugly Boy, which he had torn up soon afterwriting it, plus two or three other plays that had also gone no further than his ownhouse. However, he was sure that he had some ability in the field and plunged into thenewly formed Conservatory."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"When he returned to the Diário de Notícias, it became clear to Paulo that hisabsence of almost a month had put paid to or at least delayed his chances of being takenon as a reporter, but he stayed on, unpaid and uncomplaining. Working in a place thatallowed him to write every day, even if only on the trivial topics that usually fell tohim, was a good thing. At the end of July 1965, he was sent off to report on the historyof the Marian Congregation in Brazil. He was beginning to gain experience as a reporterand had no difficulty in carrying out the task; at the organization’s headquarters, heinterviewed members of the community, noted down numbers and wrote a short articledescribing the history of the Marians from the time they had arrived in Brazil with thefirst Portuguese Jesuit missionaries. The following morning on his way to school, hebought a copy of the Diário de Notícias at the newspaper stand and smiled proudlywhen he saw his article. The sub-editors had made some small changes, but they werestill essentially his words being read by thousands of readers at that very moment.When he arrived at the newspaper office after lunch, he learned that his head wason the block. The Marians were furious about the article and had gone straight to theowner of the newspaper to complain. They accused him of having invented facts andattributing them to the organization’s leaders. The cub reporter was indignant when heheard this, and although his colleagues told him to lie low until the whole thing hadblown over, he decided that it would be best to clear up the matter straight away. He satoutside the owner’s glass-walled office, the so-called fishbowl, and waited two hoursfor her to arrive.On entering the fishbowl, he remained standing in front of her desk. ‘Dona Ondina,I’m the person who wrote the article on the Marians and I’ve come to explain—’She didn’t even let him finish the sentence: ‘You’re sacked,’ she said.Surprised, he countered with: ‘But Dona Ondina, I’m about to be taken on by thenewspaper.’Without even looking up, she said again: ‘You’re sacked. Please leave.’Paulo left, regretting his naivety. If he had waited a few days, as he had beenadvised, she would probably have forgotten about the matter. Now there was no way ofsaving the situation. He returned home with his tail between his legs. Although shakenby the incident, his ability to fantasize seemed limitless. Recording in his diary hisregret at having taken the initiative, he described his dismissal as if it were a case ofpolitical persecution:I could have done all kinds of things to avoid being fired! I could have given inand gone over to the right simply in order to keep my job on the newspaper.But no. I wanted to be a martyr, crucified for his ideas, and they put me on thecross before I could give any kind of message to humanity. I couldn’t even saythat I was innocent, that I was fighting for the good of all. But no! Die now, youfilthy dog. I’m a worm. A C-O-W-A-R-D! I was sacked from the ‘DN’ for"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"being a subversive. Now I’ve got nothing but night school and lots of timedoing nothing.The Diário de Notícias was not a right-wing newspaper; nor had he been dismissed forpolitical reasons.Paulo appeared prepared to take advantage of his time in the clinic. He had beenlabelled ‘a madman’, and he intended to enjoy the impunity that protects the mentallyill and do whatever he wanted. To hell with school and his parents: he wanted to followhis dream. In his own words, he had become a ‘delinquent’ who went around withgangs, but since he lacked the physical strength of other boys, he thought that he couldbecome an ‘intellectual delinquent’–someone who read things that none of his friendshad read and knew things that no one else knew. He belonged to three different groups–Paissandu, the Conservatory and what remained of Rota 15–but whenever there was anysign of violence, he felt ashamed that he didn’t have the courage even to break up afistfight.He knew, however, that displays of physical strength were not the way forward.Whereas before he had felt himself to be ‘an existentialist on the road to communism’,now he saw himself as ‘a street communist’. He had read Henry Miller’s famous trilogySexus, Plexus and Nexus, and glanced over the works of Marx and Engels, and he feltconfident enough to talk on such topics as ‘true socialism’, ‘the Cold War’ and ‘theexploitation of the worker’. In a text entitled ‘Art in Brazil’, he quotes Lenin as havingspoken of the need to take two steps back when it was clear that this was the only wayof taking one step forward. ‘Art cannot flee from this premise. It must first adapt toman and then, having gained his confidence, respect and love, it can lead him along theroad to reality.’ His basis for taking a route he had earlier rejected was simple: ‘I am anintellectual, and since all intellectuals are communists, I am a communist.’ The motherof a girl he was friendly with accused him of ‘putting ideas’ in the heads of the poorpeople in the street. ‘From Henry Miller to communism is only a step,’ he wrote;‘therefore, I’m a communist.’ What he would only confess to his diary was that heloathed Bergman and considered Godard ‘a bore’ and Antonioni ‘annoying’. In factwhat he really liked was to listen to The Beatles, but it wasn’t quite right for acommunist to say this in public.As he had predicted, his studies were relegated firmly to the background. In August,fearing that he would fail the year, the school summoned Lygia and Pedro to deal withthree issues: low grades, too many absences and ‘the student’s personal problems’.Since the start of classes after the July holidays he had not achieved marks above 2.5 inany subject and during that time he had not been to a single maths lesson, whichexplained why he had never got more than 3 in the subject since moving to the college.He would leave home every morning and go to school, but once there, involved as hewas with the drama group, he would spend whole days without entering the classroom."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The verdict presented to his parents was worrying: either their son paid more attentionto his studies or he would be expelled. Although the college did not adopt the samestrategy as that used at St Ignatius, the director of studies subtly suggested to hisparents that ‘to avoid the worst’, it might be best to move him before the end of the yearto a ‘less demanding’ educational establishment. Put bluntly: if they didn’t want to havethe shame of seeing their son fail again, the best thing would be to enrol him in acollege where the pupil only had to pay his monthly fees promptly in order to guaranteesuccess. Lygia and Pedro were indignant at this suggestion. Neither of them had losthope of Paulo returning to the straight and narrow, and to accept such an idea meant ahumiliating surrender. There was no way they would let him end up in a fifth-rateschool.Paulo, meanwhile, seemed to be living on another planet. His life within the worldof theatre, which was a hotbed of opposition to the military regime, brought him closeto young people who were becoming politically militant. Now all the films and plays hewatched were political, and he had incorporated into his vocabulary left-wing sloganssuch as ‘More bread, fewer guns’ and ‘United, the people will never be defeated’.One night, when he went with a group of his friends to see Liberdade, Liberdade[Freedom, Freedom], which was being put on by Oduvaldo Viana Filho and PauloAutran at the Teatro Opinião, the play was interrupted halfway through. A dishevelledyoung man got up on the stage and spoke out against the military dictatorship. He wasVladimir Palmeira, the student leader who went on to become a Member of Parliamentand who was urging the audience to join yet another student march against the regime.On the few occasions when Paulo decided to take part in such marches, his realobjective was to be seen by his father, whose office was in the centre of the city, whereall the protest marches ended up. In fact, the world of politics that he was being drawninto had never much mattered to him. Apart from one or two notes, such as the resultsof the presidential elections in 1960 won by Jânio Quadros, his diary reflects hisindifference to both politics and politicians. When the army had taken power in theApril of the previous year, Paulo was speculating loftily in his diary on the existence ofheaven and hell. Two weeks before the coup, when the whole country was in uproar, hefilled several pages in his diary describing the misfortunes of a ‘sixteen-year-old girl’he had met in the street: ‘To think that this girl ran away from home and that in order tosurvive, she has been subjected to the most humiliating of things, although she has stillmanaged to keep her virginity. But now she’ll have to lose that just so she can eat.’ Andhe ended: ‘It’s at times like this that I doubt the existence of God.’However, that was the past. Now he felt himself to be a member of the resistance,although his criticisms of the dictatorship never went beyond the limits of his diary andeven then were very timid. It was in his diary that he recorded his dissatisfaction withthe existing situation, for example, in a satirical article entitled ‘J’accuse’, in which heplaced The Beatles, Franco, Salazar and Lyndon Johnson on one side and on the other de"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Gaulle, Glauber Rocha and Luís Carlos Prestes:I accuse the rich, who have bought the consciences of the politicians. I accusethe military, who use guns to control the feelings of the people. I accuse theBeatles, Carnival and football of diverting the minds of a generation that hadenough blood to drown the tyrants. I accuse Franco and Salazar, who live byoppressing their compatriots. I accuse Lyndon Johnson, who oppressescountries too poor to resist the flow of dollars. I accuse Pope Paul VI, who hasdefiled the words of Christ.But is there anything good in the world around me? Yes, it’s not alldisappointment. There’s de Gaulle, who revived France and wants to spreadfreedom throughout the world. There’s Yevtushenko, who raised his voiceagainst a regime, knowing that he could be crushed without anyone knowing,but who saw that humanity was prepared to accept his thoughts, free as doves.There’s Khrushchev, who allowed the poet to express himself as he wished.There’s Francisco Julião and Miguel Arraes, two true leaders who knew how tofight to the end. There’s Ruy Guerra and Glauber Rocha, who brought topopular art a message of revolt. There’s Luís Carlos Prestes, who sacrificedeverything for an ideal. There’s the life beating inside me so that one day I canspeak out too. There’s the world in the hands of the young. Perhaps, before it’stoo late, they will realize what this means. And fight to the death.The first job opportunity to arise, meanwhile, was light-years away from the battleagainst the military dictatorship and the exploitation of underdeveloped countries byAmerican imperialism. An actors’ cooperative called Grupo Destaque was rehearsing adramatized version of the children’s classic Pinocchio, which was to be performed atthe end of 1965, and the directors had a problem. The show required seven scene-changes, and the directors were worried that each time the curtain fell, the audience,mostly children, would start wandering around the theatre and delay the start of the nextscene. The producer, the Frenchman Jean Arlin, came up with a simple solution: theywould get another actor to appear on the stage during each interval and distract thechildren until the curtain rose again. He recalled an ugly, awkward, but witty youngman, Paulo Coelho, who had been introduced to him by Joel Macedo. He would beperfect for the role. This was hardly resistance theatre, and the role didn’t even have ascript, which meant he would simply have to improvise, and it was unlikely he wouldget paid very much. As a cooperative venture, after each show, the takings would beshared out, most of them going to pay first for the hire of the theatre, and then thetechnicians, lighting assistants and scene-shifters. If anything was left over, then itwould be divided equally among the actors, each of whom would get only enough to pay"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"for a snack. All the same, Paulo accepted the invitation on the spot.During his first rehearsal, he chose to wear a ragged pair of dungarees and an oldhat and waited in the wings to make his entrance. The only instruction he had receivedfrom the director, the Argentine Luís Maria Olmedo, who was known as Cachorro, wasto improvise. When the curtain fell for the first scene-change, he went on stage, pullingfunny faces, and said whatever came into his head: ‘When Little Potato starts to grow,he spreads across the ground. When Little Mama falls to sleep she puts her hand uponher heart.’From then on, to his friends in the theatre he was known as Batatinha, or LittlePotato. Although he considered himself to be a useless actor, during the followingweeks he worked so hard at his role that when Pinocchio was about to open, hisappearances had become so much part of the show that his name appeared in theprogramme and on the posters. At each rehearsal, he elaborated a little more on hisperformance–although always sticking to the time allowed for the scene-change–inventing strange names, making faces, jumping around and shouting. Deep down, hethought the whole thing ridiculous, but if that was the door that would allow him toenter the world of the theatre, he would go through it. In Grupo Destaque he workedwith professionals who made their living from the theatre. After the rehearsals, thecheerful, lively group would leave the Miguel Lemos theatre, walk along the beach toRua Sá Ferreira, four blocks away, and make an obligatory stop at the Gôndola bar,where the actors, technicians and directors who packed the stages of Copacabana’stwenty theatres would meet every night.Paulo felt he was in heaven. He was eighteen now, which meant he could drinkwhen he wanted, go to any film or play and stay out all night without having to answerto anyone. Except, of course, to his father, Pedro Coelho, who took a dim view of hisson’s burgeoning theatrical vocation. This was not only because he hardly ever went toschool and was on the verge of being expelled again. For his parents, the world of thetheatre was a ‘den of homosexuals, communists, drug addicts and idlers’ with whomthey would prefer their son not to mix. At the end of December, though, they gave inand accepted his invitation to the preview of Pinocchio. After all, this was a children’sclassic, not the indecent, subversive theatre that was enjoying such success in thecountry.Paulo had reserved seats for his parents, his sister and his grandparents and, to hissurprise, they all turned up. On the first night, the cultural section of the Jornal doBrasil published an article and his name appeared in print for the first time. He was laston the list, but for someone who was just beginning it was the right place. He recordedthe feeling of being on stage in a short but emotional note in his diary: ‘Yesterday wasmy début. Excitement. Real excitement. It was just unbelievable when I found myselfthere in front of the audience, with the spotlights blinding me, and with me making theaudience laugh. Sublime, truly sublime. It was my first performance this year.’ The"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"family’s attendance at the first night did not mean an armistice, however. When theylearned that Paulo had failed at Andrews, his parents forced him to attend group therapythree times a week, still convinced that he had mental problems.Indifferent to the hostility on the domestic front, he was having a wonderful time.In a matter of weeks, he had practically created a new character in the play. When thecurtain fell on one scene, he would sit on the edge of the stage, unwrap a delicioustoffee or sweet and start to eat it.The children would watch greedily and when he asked one of the children in thefront row: ‘Would you like one?’ the whole audience would yell: ‘I want one! I wantone!’To which he would reply heartlessly: ‘Well, too bad. I’m not going to give youone!’Batatinha would take another bite or lick and turn to the audience again: ‘Wouldyou like one?’More shouting, and again he would refuse. This would be repeated until the curtainrose for the next act.A month and a half after the first night, Pinocchio moved to the Teatro Carioca,which was on the ground floor of an apartment block in Flamengo, a few metres fromthe Paissandu cinema. One afternoon when he was rehearsing, Paulo noticed that a verybeautiful girl with blue eyes and very long hair had sat down in one of the rear stallsseats and seemed to be watching him closely. It was Fabíola Fracarolli, who lived on theeighth floor of the building, had noticed the open door and, out of curiosity, gone in totake a look. The following day, Fabíola returned and, on the third day, Paulo decided toapproach her. She was sixteen and she lived in a small rented apartment with herwidowed mother, who was a dressmaker, and her maternal grandmother, a nutty oldwoman who sat all day clutching a bag full of old papers, which she said were ‘herfortune’.Up to the age of fifteen, Fabíola had been afflicted with an enormous, grotesquenose à la Cyrano de Bergerac. When she learned that the only boy she had managed toattract had been paid to take her out by her cousins, she didn’t think twice. She climbedon to the window ledge and said to her mother: ‘Either you pay for plastic surgery orI’ll jump!’ Weeks later, when she had recovered from the surgery, she was parading aneat, sculptured nose. It was this new Fabíola who fell madly in love with Paulo.Things were going well for Paulo when it came to women. While continuing hisrelationship with Renata Sorrah, he had decided to forgive Márcia and take her back asa girlfriend. This didn’t stop him beginning a steady relationship with Fabíola. Hermother seemed to take pity on the puny young man with breathing problems andwelcomed him into the family. He would have lunch and dinner with them almost everyday, which made his life as Batatinha all the more comfortable. As if such kindnesswere not enough, soon Fabíola’s mother, Beth, moved her bed into her sick mother’s"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"bedroom, thus freeing up a small room, which Paulo began to use as a studio, office andmeeting room. To make the place seem less domestic, he covered the walls, ceiling andeven the floor with pages from newspapers. When Beth was not around, his workspacebecame the bedroom where Fabíola had her first sexual experience. However, Paulo stillcould not understand why such a beautiful girl like her would be attracted to the rathersickly person he thought himself to be.Riddled with insecurity and driven by what was certainly a mad streak, he gave heran ultimatum: ‘I can’t believe that a woman as beautiful as you, with your charm, yourbeautiful clothes, can be in love with me. I need to know that you really love me.’When Fabíola replied confidently ‘I’ll do whatever you want me to do’, he said: ‘Ifyou really love me, let me stub this cigarette out on your thigh. And you’re not to cry.’The girl lifted the edge of her long Indian wrapover skirt, like someone waiting tohave an injection. Then she smiled at him without saying a word. Paulo took a long dragon his cigarette and stubbed it out on her smooth, tanned leg. With her eyes closed,Fabíola heard the hiss and smelled the repellent stench of the hot ash burning her skin–she would bear the scar for the rest of her life–but she didn’t utter a sound or shed atear. Paulo said nothing, but thought: She really does love me.Although he made constant declarations of love, his feelings for Fabíola wereambiguous. While, on the one hand, he was proud to be seen in the fashionable places ofRio hand-in-hand with such a beautiful girl, on the other, he was embarrassed by hersilliness and her extraordinary ignorance about almost everything. Fabíola was what, inthose days, was known as a cocota or bimbo. When she announced over a few beers thatMao Tse Tung was ‘the French couturier who created the Mao suits’, Paulo wished theground would open up and swallow him. But it was such a comfortable relationship,which made no demands on him, and she was so pretty that it was worth putting up withher stupid remarks with good grace.The day she was invited to his house, she was astonished. Judging by herboyfriend’s ragged appearance and his lack of money (she often gave him some of herallowance so that he could buy cigarettes and take the bus), Fabíola had alwaysimagined that he was poor and homeless. Imagine her surprise, then, when she wasreceived by a butler wearing white gloves and a jacket with gold buttons. For a moment,she assumed Paulo must be the son of one of the employees, but no, he was the son ofthe master of the house–‘an enormous pink house with a grand piano and vast courtyardgardens’, she said later, recalling that day. ‘Just think–in the middle of the drawingroom there was a staircase that was identical to the one in Gone With the Wind...’Although he was eighteen and enjoying relative independence, Paulo stillsometimes behaved like a child. One night, he stayed late at Márcia’s house, listening torecordings of poetry (her family had given in and decided to accept him), and onreturning home, which was only a few metres away, he came across what he called ‘agroup of nasty-looking individuals’. In fact, they were simply some boys with whom"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"he’d had words a few days earlier when he complained about the noise they weremaking playing football. However, when he saw them armed with sticks and bottles, hewas terrified, went back to Márcia’s apartment and called home, waking his irasciblefather. Dramatic and theatrical as ever, he begged: ‘Papa, come and collect me fromMárcia’s house. But come with a revolver because twelve criminals are threatening tokill me.’ He would not leave until he looked out of the apartment window and saw hisfather in pyjamas, with a catapult in his hand, thus guaranteeing him a safe return home.This paternal zeal did not mean that the situation at home had improved. Thingswere still as tense as ever, but his parents’ control over his life had slackened. Hisperformance during the second term at Andrews had been so dreadful that he wasn’tactually allowed to take the end-of-year exams and was thrown out. The only solutionwas to take the route Pedro had sworn never to accept: to look for a college that was‘less demanding’. The choice was Guanabara, in Flamengo, where Paulo hoped to finishhis schooling and then apply for a university course, although not in engineering, as hisfather so wanted. By opting to take the evening course at the college, he forced hisparents to relax their vigilance on his timekeeping and give him a key to the house, butthis freedom was won at a price: if he wanted independence and to choose a college forhimself, to do drama and get home whenever he wanted, then he would have to findwork. Pedro found his son a job where he could earn money selling advertising space inthe programmes for the Jockey Club races, but after weeks and weeks of trying, the newentrant into the world of work hadn’t managed to sell a single square centimetre ofadvertising space.His lack of success did not dismay his father, who suggested another option, thistime with Souza Alves Acessórios, a company specializing in the sale of industrialequipment. Although he hated doing anything he was forced to do, Paulo decided toagree for the sake of financial independence, because this was a job with a fixed salaryand he wouldn’t have to sell anything to anyone. On the first day, he turned up in a suitand tie with his unruly hair slicked down. He wanted to know where his desk would beand was surprised when the manager led him to an enormous shed, pointed to a broomand told him: ‘You can start here. First you can sweep out this storeroom. When you’vefinished, let me know.’Sweep out a storeroom? But he was an actor, a writer. Had his father fixed him upwith a job as a cleaner? No, this must be some kind of joke, a prank they played on allthe new employees on their first day at work. He decided to play the game, rolled up hissleeves and swept the floor until lunchtime, by which time his arms were beginning toache. When the job was finished, he put on his jacket and, smiling, told his boss that hewas ready. Without even looking at the new employee, the man handed him a sales slipand pointed to the door: ‘Get twenty boxes of hydrometers from that room and takethem to dispatch, on the ground floor, with this sales slip.’This could only have been done deliberately to humiliate him: his father had found"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"him work as a mere factory hand. Despondently, he did what he had been ordered to doand, after a few days, discovered that the routine was always the same: carrying boxes,packing water and electricity meters, sweeping the floor of the storeroom and thewarehouse. Just as when he had worked on the dredger, he again felt like Sisyphus. Assoon as he finished one thing, he was given something else to do. Weeks later, he wrotein his diary: ‘This is like a slow suicide. I’m just not going to cope with waking up atsix every morning, starting work at seven thirty to sweep the floor and cart stuff aroundall day without even stopping for lunch, and then having to go to rehearsals untilmidnight.’He survived only a month and a half in the job and had no need to ask if he couldleave. The manager decided to call Pedro and tell him that the boy was no good ‘for thistype of work’. When he left the building for the last time, Paulo had 30 cruzeiros in hispocket–the wages to which he was entitled. It was understandable that he couldn’t dothe work. Apart from performing in Pinocchio, which was on six days a week, he hadbegun rehearsing another children’s play, A Guerra dos Lanches [The War of theSnacks], which was also directed by Luís Olmedo. ‘I’ve got a role in this new play,’ hewrote proudly, ‘thanks to my spectacular performance as Batatinha in Pinocchio.’ Nowhe was going to work as a real actor, sharing the stage with his friend Joel Macedo and apretty brunette called Nancy, the sister of Roberto Mangabeira Unger, the perfectstudent who had come first in almost every subject at St Ignatius. After the tiringroutine of rehearsals, the play had its first night in the middle of April 1966. Seeing hownervous Paulo was, Luís Olmedo kissed him on the forehead and said: ‘You can do it,Batatinha!’Paulo got off to a good start. Dressed as a cowboy, all he had to do was to step on tothe stage to provoke roars of laughter from the audience, and so it continued. When theshow ended, he was fêted as the best actor of the night. As the compliments cameflooding in, Luís Olmedo hugged and kissed him (much to the embarrassment ofPaulo’s parents, who had attended the first night), saying: ‘Batatinha, there are no wordsto describe your performance tonight. You were the hit of the evening, you had theaudience eating out of your hand. It was wonderful.’On the final night of Pinocchio, he repeated his success. Batatinha was the onlyactor–even though he wasn’t really an actor–who merited an extra round of applause. Ifit weren’t for the total absence of money, he would have been leading the kind of life hehad always dreamed of. He had several girlfriends, he was reasonably successful as anactor, and he had also learned to play the classical guitar and now went everywhere withthe instrument on his shoulder, just like his bossa nova idols. However, as had beenhappening for some time now, his waves of happiness were always cut short by bouts ofdeep depression. For example, this diary entry, written after reading a biography ofToulouse-Lautrec, dates from that apparently happy and exciting period of his life:"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"I’ve just this minute finished one of the most moving real-life stories I’ve everread. It’s the biography of a wealthy, talented artist, from an aristocraticfamily, who had achieved fame in his youth, but who, despite this, was theunhappiest man in the world, because his grotesque body and his incredibleugliness meant that he was never loved. He died of drink in the prime of life,his body worn down by his excesses. He was a man who, in the dark, noisycafés of Montmartre, spent time with Van Gogh, Zola, Oscar Wilde, Degas,Debussy, and from the age of eighteen lived the kind of life all intellectualsaspire to. A man who never used his wealth and social position to humiliateothers, but, on the other hand, his wealth and social position never brought acrumb of sincere love to a heart hungry for affection. In some ways, this man isvery like me. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, whose life is brilliantly described byPierre La Mure, in the 450 pages of Moulin Rouge. I’ll never forget this book.He continued reading a lot, but now, as well as making a note in his diary of each bookhe read, as he had always done, he would give each book a classification, like that givenby professional critics. One star, bad; two, good; three, very good; four, brilliant. Onone page in June, he wrote of his surprise at his own voracious literary appetite: ‘I’vebeaten my record: I’m reading five books at the same time. This really can’t go on.’And he wasn’t reading lightweight stuff either. That day, he had on his bedside tableCrime and Punishment by Dostoevsky; Fear and Trembling by Kierkegaard; For PeopleUnder Pressure: A Medical Guide by David Harold Fink; Masterpieces of WorldPoetry, edited by Sérgio Milliet; and A Panorama of Brazilian Theatre by SábatoMagaldi.In that same month in 1966, Paulo finally got up the courage to show Jean Arlin thefirst play he had written as an adult: a three-act play, Juventude sem Tempo [AgelessYouth]. This was, in fact, a miscellany of poetry, speeches and texts by various authors:Bertolt Brecht, Carlos Lacerda, Morris West, Manuel Bandeira, Vinicius de Moraes,Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Jean-Paul Sartre and, of course, Paulo Coelho. Arlinfound it interesting, fiddled with it here and there and decided to try it out. And therewas more–since it was a simple play with hardly any scenery or props, he decided to putit on at the first Festival de Juventude, which was going to be held during the holidaysin Teresópolis, 100 kilometres from Rio.Since, besides being an author, he was also an actor, in the second week of July,Paulo went to Teresópolis with Grupo Destaque, against his parents’ orders, naturally.He was excited by the festival and even entered a poem in the festival competition,which was to be judged by the poet Lêdo Ivo and the critic Walmir Ayala. The play wasa disaster and the result of the poetry competition wouldn’t be announced until a monthlater, but what mattered was that he’d had the courage to try.The atmosphere at home hadn’t changed at all. Besides continuing to nag him about"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"getting home early–he rarely returned before one in the morning–his parents were nowinsisting that he have his hair cut, something he hadn’t done for six months. When hearrived back late at night, he could rely on having to listen to a half-hour lecture beforehe could go to bed.On one such night, Pedro was waiting for him at his bedroom door, looking verythreatening: ‘Once again you’ve overstepped the mark. As from tomorrow, we’re goingback to the old regime: the doors of this house will be locked at eleven at night; anyoneleft outside then can sleep in the street.’Paulo spent the following day going from his ‘studio’ in Fabíola’s home torehearsals of A Guerra dos Lanches, for which the audiences were becoming smallerand smaller. In the evening, he went to the Paissandu to see Godard’s latest film, LaChinoise; although he didn’t much like the director, he was interested in attending thedebate on the film that was to be held afterwards. There he met Renata and at the end ofthe evening the two went out to supper together. There was hardly anyone else in therestaurant when they finally asked for the bill and set off towards Leblon. Hand in hand,they walked almost 3 kilometres along the beach to Rua Rita Ludolf, where Renatalived. Exhausted, Paulo hoped desperately that a bus on the Lapa–Leblon route wouldcome by, and it must have been almost four in the morning when he put his key in thefront door, except that the key wouldn’t go in. It was only then that he realized that hisfather must have had the lock changed.At that hour in the morning, he couldn’t possibly go to Joel’s or Fabíola’s. Furious,he grabbed a handful of stones and began to break all the glass in windows and doors atthe front of the house. Woken by the noise, his parents at first decided to ignore him,but fearing that the neighbours would call the police, Pedro went downstairs and openedthe door to his son. Making no secret of the fact that he had drunk too much, Paulostalked across the glass-strewn drawing room and went upstairs without listening to aword his father was saying.That night he went straight to sleep, but he had a dreadful nightmare. He dreamedthat there was a doctor sitting on the edge of his bed taking his blood pressure and twomale nurses standing at the door of the room holding a straitjacket. It was only then thathe realized with horror that this was no dream. His father had called the emergencyservices of the mental asylum to admit him again. This time by force."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7Ballad of the Clinic GaolWednesday, 20 July08:00 I was woken up to have my blood pressure taken. Still groggy with sleep,I thought it was a dream, but gradually, the reality of the situation began to sinkin. It was the end. They told me to get dressed quickly.

Yesterday, I washappily walking with my girlfriend, a little worried, but certainly not expectingthis. And here I am again. If I’d stayed out all night rather than gone home, Iwouldn’t have had that scene with my parents. I think of my girlfriendsometimes. I miss her.Here everyone is sad. There are no smiles. Eyes stare into emptiness,seeking something, perhaps an encounter with the self. My room-mate isobsessed with death. To tease him, I play the Funeral March on the guitar. It’sgood to have my guitar here. It brings a little joy into this atmosphere ladenwith sadness–the profound sadness of those who aspire to nothing in life andwant nothing. The only thing that consoles me is that they still know how tosing.15:00 I was talking to a young man who has been in here for two years now. Itold him I couldn’t bear it and wanted to get out. And he said in all sincerity:‘Why? It’s great here. You don’t have to worry about anything. Why struggle?Deep down, nobody cares about anything anyway.’ I felt afraid, afraid that Imight start thinking like him. I now feel real anguish, the anguish of notknowing when I will stop seeing the world through bars. It’s indescribable.

Who would I have been saying it to? Can I stillspeak?I’m shocked at how calmly people accept being shut up in here. I’m afraid Imight come to accept it too. If every man is an incendiary at 20 and a firemanat 40, then I reckon I must be 39 years and eleven months old. I’m on the brinkof defeat. I felt this when my mother was here this afternoon.

Now that Dr Benjamimhas threatened me with insulin and electroconvulsive therapy, now that I’vebeen accused of being a drug addict, now that I feel like a cornered animal,utterly defenceless, I want so much to talk to you. If this was the moment whenmy personality was about to be completely transformed, if in a few moments’time the systematic destruction of my being was about to begin, I would wantyou by my side, Rennie.We’d talk about the most ordinary things in the world.

And downstairs, you’dlook up and see my hand through the bars waving goodbye. Then I’d come upto my room and cry my heart out thinking about what was and what shouldhave been and what can never be. Then the doctors would come in with theblack bag, and the electric shocks would enter me and fill my whole body.And in the solitude of the night, I would pick up a razor blade and look atyour photo next to the bed, and the blood would flow; and I would say to yousoftly, as I looked at your smiling face: ‘This is my blood.’ And I would diewithout a smile on my face, without shedding a tear.

That’s myphilosophy: if we love what we do, that’s enough to justify our actions.’‘If I went and fetched four schizophrenics from the fourth floor, I meanreal schizoids, even they would come up with a better argument than that.’‘What did I say wrong?’‘What did you say wrong?!

I’d like to write a message full of optimismand understanding in this notebook: that’s why I tore out the previous pages, sodevoid of compassion and so sad. It’s hard, especially for someone of mytemperament, to withstand thirty-two days without going out into the courtyardand seeing the sun. It’s really hard, believe me. But, deep down, I know I’m notthe most unfortunate of men. I have youth flowing in my veins, and I can startall over again thousands of times.It’s the eve of my birthday. With these lines written at dawn, I would liketo regain a little self-confidence.‘Look, Paulo, you can always do your university entrance exams next year:you’ve still got many years ahead of you. Make the most of these days to thinka little and to write a lot. Rosetta, your typewriter, your loyal companion-at-arms, is with you, ready to serve you whenever you wish. Do you rememberwhat Salinger wrote: “Store away your experiences. Perhaps, later, they’ll beuseful to someone else, just as the experiences of those who came before wereuseful to you.” Think about that. Don’t think of yourself as being alone. Afterall, to begin with, your friends were a great support. Being forgotten is a law oflife. You’d probably forget about one of your friends if they left. Don’t beangry with your friends because of that. They did what they could. They lostheart, as you would in their place.’Thursday, 1 SeptemberI’ve been here since July. Now I’m becoming more and more afraid. I’m toblame for everything. Yesterday, for example, I was the only one to agree tohaving an injection to help me sleep, and I was the only one to obey the nurseand lie down; the others, meanwhile, continued kicking up a ruckus. One of thenuns who help out here took a dislike to my girlfriend and so she’s not allowedto visit me any more.

He had just been re-reading ‘The Ballad of the Clinic Gaol’, which he hadfinished writing the day before, and he felt proud of the thirty-five typewritten pagesthat he had managed to produce in a month and a half at the mental asylum. In fact, itwas not so very different from the work that had inspired him, Oscar Wilde’s ‘TheBallad of Reading Gaol’, written in 1898, after his release from prison, where he hadserved two years for homosexual offences. Paulo’s final sentence on the last page–‘Nowlet’s start all over again’–might seem like mere empty words, a rather glib ending.Starting all over again meant only one thing: to get out of the hell that was the clinic asquickly as possible and restart his life. However, a terrifying idea was daily becomingmore of a reality: if it was up to the doctors or his parents, he would continue to rot onthe ninth floor for a long time.Absorbed in these thoughts, he hardly noticed the two male nurses who came overto him and asked him to go with them to another part of the building. They led him to acubicle with tiled floor and walls, where Dr Benjamim was waiting. In the centre of theroom was a bed covered with a thick rubber sheet and, to one side, a small machine thatlooked like an ordinary electric transformer with wires and a handle, much like theequipment used clandestinely by the police to torture prisoners and extract confessions.Paulo was terrified: ‘Do you mean I’m going to have shock treatment?’Kindly and smiling as ever, the psychiatrist tried to calm him: ‘Don’t worry, Paulo.It doesn’t hurt at all. It’s more upsetting seeing someone else being treated thanreceiving the treatment yourself. Really, it doesn’t hurt at all.’Lying on the bed, he watched a nurse putting a plastic tube in his mouth so that histongue wouldn’t roll back and choke him. The other nurse stood behind him and stuckan electrode that looked like a small cardiac defibrillator to each of his temples. Whilehe stared up at the peeling paint on the ceiling, the machine was connected. A session ofelectroconvulsive therapy was about to begin. As the handle was turned, a curtainseemed to fall over his eyes. His vision was narrowing until it was fixed on one point;then everything went dark.At each subsequent turn of the handle his body shook uncontrollably and salivaspurted from his mouth like white foam. Paulo never knew how long each sessionlasted–Minutes? An hour? A day? Nor did he feel any sickness afterwards. When herecovered consciousness he felt as though he were coming round after a general"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"anaesthetic: his memory seemed to disappear and he would sometimes lie for hours onhis bed, eyes open, before he could recognize and identify where he was and what hewas doing there. Apart from the pillowcase and his pyjama collar, which were wet withdribble, there was no sign in the room of the brutality to which he had been subjected.The ‘therapy’ was powerful enough to destroy his neurones, but the doctor was right: itdidn’t hurt at all.Electroconvulsive therapy was based on the idea that mental disturbance resultedfrom ‘electrical disturbances in the brain’. After ten to twenty sessions of electricshocks applied every other day, the convulsions caused by the succession of electriccharges would, it was believed, ‘reorganize’ the patient’s brain, allowing him to returnto normal. This treatment was seen as a great improvement on other treatments used atthe time such as Metazol and insulin shock: it caused retrograde amnesia, blocking anymemory of events immediately prior to the charges, including their application. Thepatient would therefore have no negative feelings towards the doctors or his ownfamily.After that first session, Paulo woke late in the afternoon with a sour taste in hismouth. During the torpor that dulled both mind and body after the treatment, he got upvery slowly, as if he were an old man, and went over to the grille at the window. He sawthat it was drizzling, but he still did not recognize his room, where he had been takenfollowing the treatment. He tried to remember what lay beyond the door, but couldn’t.When he went towards it, he realized that his legs were trembling and his body had beenweakened by the shocks. With some difficulty, he managed to leave his room. There hesaw an enormous, empty corridor and felt like walking a little through that cemetery ofthe living. The silence was such that he could hear the sound of his slippers draggingalong the white, disinfected corridor. As he took his first steps, he had the clearimpression that the walls were closing in around him as he walked, until he began tofeel them pressing on his ribs. The walls were enclosing him so tightly that he couldwalk no farther. Terrified, he tried to reason with himself: ‘If I stay still, nothing willhappen to me. But if I walk, I’ll either destroy the walls or I’ll be crushed.’What should he do? Nothing. He stayed still, not moving a muscle. And he stayedthere, for how long, he doesn’t know, until a female nurse led him gently by the arm,back to his room, and helped him to lie down. When he woke, he saw someone standingbeside him, someone who had apparently been talking to him while he slept. It was LuísCarlos, the patient from the room next door, a thin mulatto who was so ashamed of hisstammer that he would pretend to be dumb when meeting strangers. Like everyone elsethere, he also swore that he wasn’t mad. ‘I’m here because I decided to retire,’ he wouldwhisper, as though revealing a state secret. ‘I asked a doctor to register me as insane,and if I manage to stay here as a madman for two years, I’ll be allowed to retire.’Paulo could not stand hearing such stories. When his parents visited, he wouldkneel down, weep and beg them to take him away, but the answer was always the same:"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"‘Wait a few more days. You’re almost better. Dr Benjamim is going to let you out in afew days.’His only contacts with the outside world were the ever-more infrequent visits fromthe friends who managed to get through the security. By taking advantage of thecomings and goings at the gate, anyone with a little patience could get through, takingin whatever he or she wanted. So it was that Paulo managed to get a friend to smugglein a loaded 7.65 automatic revolver, hidden in his underpants. However, once rumoursbegan to spread among the other patients that Paulo was walking around armed, hequickly stuffed the Beretta into Renata’s bag, and she left with the gun. She was hismost frequent visitor. When she couldn’t get through security, she would leave notes atthe gate to be given to him.The fool in the lift knows me now and today he wouldn’t let me come up. Tellthe people there that you had a row with me, and maybe that band of tosserswill stop messing you around.I feel miserable, not because you’ve made me miserable, but because Idon’t know what to do to help you.[...] The pistol is safe in my wardrobe. I didn’t show it to anyone. Well, Idid show it to António Cláudio, my brother. But he’s great; he didn’t even askwhose it was. But I told him.[...] I’ll deliver this letter tomorrow. It’s going to be a miserable day. Oneof those days that leave people hurting inside. Then I’m going to wait forfifteen minutes down below looking up at your window to see if you’vereceived it. If you don’t appear, it will be because they haven’t given you theletter.[...] Batata, I’m so afraid that sometimes I want to go and talk to yourmother or Dr Benjamim. But it wouldn’t help. So if you can, see if you can sitit out. I mean it. I had a brilliant idea: when you get out, we’ll take a cargo shipand go to Portugal and live in Oporto–good idea?[...] You know, I bought a pack of your favourite cigarettes because thatway I’ll have a little bit of the taste of you in my mouth.On his birthday, it was Renata who turned up with a bundle of notes and letters she hadcollected from his friends with optimistic, cheerful messages, all of them hoping thatBatatinha would soon return to the stage. Among this pile of letters full of kisses andpromises to visit there was one message that particularly excited him. It was a three-line note from Jean Arlin: ‘Batatinha my friend, our play Timeless Youth is having itsfirst night on 12 September here in Rio. We’re counting on the presence of the author.’The idea of running away surfaced more strongly when Paulo realized that with his"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"newly cropped hair he was unrecognizable, even to his room-mate. He spent two dayssitting on a chair in the corridor pretending to read a book but in fact watching out ofthe corner of his eye the movements of the lift–the only possible escape route, since thestairs were closed off with iron grilles. One thing was sure: the busiest time wasSunday, between midday and one in the afternoon, when the doctors, nurses andemployees changed shift and mingled with the hundreds of visitors who were getting inand out of the packed lift.In pyjamas and slippers the risk of being caught was enormous. But if he weredressed in ‘outdoor clothes’ and wearing shoes, it would be possible to merge unnoticedwith the other people crowding together so that they wouldn’t miss the lift; then hecould leave the building complex. Concealed behind his open book, Paulo mentallyrehearsed his escape route dozens, hundreds of times. He considered all the possibleobstacles and unexpected incidents that might occur and concluded that the chances ofescaping were fairly high. It would have to be soon, though, before everyone got used tohis new appearance without his usual shoulder-length curly mane.He spoke of his plan to only two people: Renata and Luís Carlos, his ‘dumb’neighbour in the clinic. His girlfriend not only urged him on but contributed 30cruzeiros–about US$495 today–from her savings in case he should have to bribesomeone. Luís Carlos was so excited by the idea that he decided to go too, as he was fedup with being stuck in the clinic. Paulo asked whether this meant he was giving up hisidea of using mental illness as a way of retiring, but his fellow inmate replied: ‘Runningaway is part of the illness. Every mad person runs away at least once. I’ve run awaybefore, and then I came back of my own accord.’Finally the long-awaited day arrived: Sunday, 4 September 1966. Duly dressed in‘normal people’s clothes’, the two friends thought the lift ride down, stopping at everyfloor, would never end. They kept their heads lowered, fearing that a doctor or nursethey knew might get in at any moment. It was a relief when they reached the groundfloor and went up to the gate, not so fast as to arouse suspicion, but not so slowly as tobe easily identified. Everything went exactly to plan. Since there had been no need tobribe anyone, the money Renata had given Paulo was enough to keep them going for afew days.Still with Luís Carlos, Paulo went to the bus station and bought two tickets toMangaratiba, a small town on the coast, a little more than 100 kilometres south of Rio.The sun was starting to set when the two of them hired a boat to take them to an islandhalf an hour from the mainland. The tiny island of Guaíba was a paradise as yetunspoiled by people. Heloísa Araripe, ‘Aunt Helói’, Paulo’s mother’s sister, had a houseon Tapera beach, and it was only when he arrived there, still with the ‘dumb’ man intow, that he felt himself safe from the wretched clinic, the doctors and nurses.The place seemed ideal as a refuge, but hours after getting there, the two realizedthat they wouldn’t be able to stay there for long, at least not the way things were. The"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"house was rarely used by Aunt Helói, and had only a clay filter half full with water–andthis of a highly suspicious green colour. The caretaker, a man from Cananéia who livedin a cabin a few metres from the house, showed no interest in sharing his dinner. Theywere by now extremely hungry, but the only relief for their rumbling stomachs was abanana tree. When they woke the following day, their arms and legs covered inmosquito bites, they had to go to the same banana tree for breakfast, lunch and, finally,dinner. On the second day, Luís Carlos suggested that they should try fishing, but thisidea failed when they discovered that the stove in the house had no gas and that therewas no cutlery, oil or salt in the kitchen–nothing. On the Tuesday, three days after theirarrival, they spent hours in the depot waiting for the first boat to take them back to themainland. When the bus from Mangaratiba left them at the bus station in Rio, Paulotold his fellow fugitive that he was going to spend a few days in hiding until he haddecided what to do with his life. Luís Carlos had also concluded that their adventurewas coming to an end and had decided to go back to the clinic.The two said goodbye, roaring with laughter and promising that they would meetagain some day. Paulo took a bus and knocked on the door of Joel Macedo’s house,where he hoped to remain until he had worked out what to do next. His friend wasdelighted to receive him, but he was worried that his house might not be a good hiding-place, as Lygia and Pedro knew that Paulo used to sleep there when he stayed out late. Ifhe were to leave Rio, the ideal hiding-place would be the house that Joel’s father hadjust finished building in a condominium at Cabo Frio, a town 40 kilometres fromAraruama. Before setting out, Joel asked Paulo to have a bath and change his clothes, ashe didn’t fancy travelling with a friend who hadn’t washed or had clean clothes for fourdays. A few hours later, they set off in Joel’s estate car, driven by Joel (after the traumaof the accident, Paulo hadn’t even touched a steering wheel).The friends spent the days drinking beer, walking along the beach and readingJoel’s latest passion, the plays of Maxim Gorki and Nikolai Gogol. When the last ofRenata’s money had gone, Paulo thought it was time to return. It was a week since hehad run away and he was tired of just wandering about with nowhere to go. He went to atelephone box and made a reverse-charge call home. On hearing his voice, his fatherdidn’t sound angry, but was genuinely concerned for his physical and mental state.When he learned that his son was in Cabo Frio, Pedro offered to come and fetch him inthe car, but Paulo preferred to return with Joel.Lygia and Pedro had spent a week searching desperately for their son in mortuariesand police stations, and this experience had changed them profoundly. They agreed thathe should not return to the clinic and even said that they were interested in his work inthe theatre; and they appeared to have permanently lifted the curfew of eleven o’clockat night. Paulo distrusted this offer. ‘After a week of panic, with no news of me,’ he wasto say later, ‘they would have accepted any conditions, and so I took advantage of that.’He grew his hair again, as well as a ridiculous beard, and no one told him off. In his"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"very limited free time, he devoted himself to girls. Besides Renata and Fabíola (Márciawas not around much), he had also taken up with Genivalda, a rather plain, but veryintelligent girl from the northeast of Brazil. Geni, as she preferred to be called, didn’tdress well, she didn’t live in a smart part of town and she didn’t study at the Catholicuniversity in Rio or at one of the smart colleges. However, she seemed to knoweverything and that ensured her a place in the Paissandu circle.Paulo’s growing success with women was due not–as with Fabíola–to any surgicalintervention but to a change in fashion. The ‘counterculture’ revolution that wasspreading across the world was transforming not only political patterns and behaviourbut also people’s idea of what was attractive. This meant that men who had always beenconsidered ugly up until then, such as the rock star Frank Zappa or, in Brazil, themusician Caetano Veloso, had overnight become ideals of modern beauty. The newcriterion for beauty demanded that the virile, healthy and carefully shaven man bereplaced by the dishevelled, ill-dressed and physically frail variety.As a beneficiary of this new trend, Paulo had only one problem: finding a placewhere he could make love. He was eager to make up for lost time, and as well as hislong-standing girlfriends, there were various others whom he chanced to meet. At atime when motels did not exist and morality demanded a marriage certificate whenregistering in a hotel, there were few alternatives for the young who, like him, did nothave a bachelor pad. Not that he could complain, though, since as well as the lenientattitude of Fabíola’s mother and grandmother, who shut their eyes and ears to what wasgoing on in the newspaper-plastered ‘studio’, he could count on the assistance of UncleJosé, in Araruama, whose door was always open to whomever Paulo might bring back atthe weekends or on holidays.Even so, when he made an unexpected conquest, he always managed to find asolution to suit the situation. On one occasion, he spent hours indulging in amorouspreliminaries with a young aspiring actress in a pedalo on Lake Rodrigo de Freitas.After visiting numerous dives and by then feeling pretty high–on alcohol, since neithertook any drugs–Paulo and the girl ended up having sex in the apartment where she livedwith a great-aunt. As it was a one-room apartment, they enjoyed themselves before theastonished eyes of the old woman, who was deaf, dumb and senile–an experience he wasto repeat several times. On another occasion, he confessed to his diary that he had hadsex in still more unusual circumstances:I invited Maria Lúcia for a walk on the beach with me; then we went to thecemetery to talk some more. That’s why I’m writing today: so that, later, I’llremember that I had a lover for one day. A young girl completely devoid ofpreconceptions, in favour of free love, a young girl who’s a woman too. Shesaid that she could tell from my physical type that I would be hot stuff in bed.And the two of us, with a few interruptions due to exhaustion or a burial taking"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"place, made love the whole afternoon.Weeks after he ran away from the clinic, however, the problem of having to findsomewhere to make love was resolved. Thanks to the mediation of his maternalgrandfather, Tuca, Paulo’s parents gave him permission to try an experiment: livingalone for a while. His new home was one offered by his grandfather: a small apartmentthat he owned in the Marquês de Herval building on Avenida Rio Branco, right in thecommercial centre of Rio.The apartment, which was a few blocks from the red light district, could not havebeen worse. During the day, the area was a noisy tumult of street vendors, traders,beggars and sellers of lottery tickets, with buses and cars travelling in every direction.From seven in the evening, there was a complete change of scene. As the brightness ofday gave way to darkness, the day workers were replaced by prostitutes, layabouts,transvestites, pimps and drug traffickers. It was entirely unlike the world Paulo camefrom, but it didn’t matter: it was his home, and he, and no one else, was in charge. Assoon as he contacted his friends in the Grupo Destaque, Paulo learned that the promisedproduction of Timeless Youth in Rio had been cancelled for lack of funds. Some of thegroup who had been in Pinocchio and A Guerra dos Lanches were now engaged onanother venture, in which Paulo immediately became involved: a play for adults. Forsome weeks, under the auspices of the Teatro Universitário Nacional, the group hadbeen rehearsing an adaptation of Capitães da Areia [Captains of the Sands], a novelwritten thirty years before by the Brazilian writer Jorge Amado. Blond, blue-eyed andtanned, the director and adapter, Francis Palmeira, looked more like one of the surferswho spent their time looking for waves in Arpoador; but, as a precocious fifteen-year-old, he had already had one play, Ato Institucional, banned by the censors. Jorge Amadowas so thrilled to see this group of young people putting on drama by establishedwriters that he not only authorized the adaptation but also wrote a foreword for theprogramme:I have entrusted the students with the adaptation of my novel Capitães da Areiaand have done so confidently and gladly: students nowadays are in thevanguard of everything that is good in Brazil. They are the untiring fighters fordemocracy, for the rights of man, for progress, for the advance of the Brazilianpeople, against dictatorship and oppression. In the novel on which they havebased their play, I also conveyed my faith in the Brazilian people andregistered my protest against all forms of injustice and oppression. The firstedition of Capitães da Areia was published a week before the proclamation ofthe ‘Estado Novo’, a cruel and ignorant dictatorship–which seized and bannedthe book. The novel was a weapon in the struggle. Today it has taken on a new"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"dimension: the stage, which makes contact with the public all the moreimmediate. I can only wish the students of the Teatro Universitário Nacionalthe greatest success, certain that they are, once again, working for the good ofdemocracy and of Brazil.It was obvious that there would be problems. The first was with the Juizado de Menores(the Juvenile Court), which acted in the interests of minors and threatened to ban therehearsals unless those under eighteen were able to show that they had permission fromtheir parents. This meant all the young people in the group, starting with the show’sdirector. Then, just a few days before the first night, the rehearsals were interrupted bythe arrival of Edgar Façanha, Member of Parliament and the head of censorship in Rio,together with a member of the Serviço Nacional de Informações, or SNI, who wanted tosee a certificate from the censor’s office, without which the play could not beperformed. When it became clear that no such certificate existed, during the ensuingargument the police arrested one of the actors, Fernando Resky, and left a warning thatif they wanted to open on 15 October 1966, as planned, they should submit a copy of thescript to the censor as soon as possible. Days later, the script was returned with certainwords deleted–‘comrade’, ‘dialogue’, ‘revolution’ and ‘freedom’–and one entiresentence cut: ‘All homes would be open to him, because revolution is a homeland and afamily for all.’ As they had already had such difficulty putting on the play, the groupthought it best to accept the cuts without protest or appeal.Although there were thirty actors in the play, Paulo had a reasonably prominentpart. He was Almiro, the homosexual lover of Barandão, who dies of smallpox at theend of the play. Jorge Amado had promised to be at the preview, but as he was in Lisbonfor the launch of his most recent novel, he asked no less a figure than ‘Volta Seca’, oneof the street boys from Salvador who had been the inspiration for the main characters inthe book, to represent him. The news in the Rio papers that Capitães da Areia had beencensored proved a magnet to audiences. On the first night, all 400 seats in the TeatroSerrador in the centre of Rio were filled. Only two of the people Paulo had invited weremissing: Renata and Dr Benjamim.After his second period at the clinic, Paulo had formed a strange relationship withthe psychiatrist. It wasn’t just affection, despite all that Paulo had been through there: itwas more that being close to the doctor and being able to talk to him about his doubtsgave him a sense of security he hadn’t felt before. At the time, such a relationshipbetween doctor and patient was considered one of the side effects of retrogradeamnesia. Many years later, however, Paulo himself diagnosed it as what came to becalled Stockholm Syndrome, the sudden and inexplicable feelings of emotionaldependence some hostages feel towards their hostage-takers. ‘I established the samerelationship of hostage and hostage-taker with Dr Benjamim,’ he said in an interview.‘Even after leaving the clinic, during the great crises of my youth and problems with my"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"love life, I would go and talk to him.’Capitães da Areia ran for two months. Apart from that first night, it wasn’t a wildsuccess, but the takings were large enough to pay the expenses and there was even somemoney left over to be shared out among the actors and technicians. There was alsopraise from respected critics.After the euphoria of the production, Paulo once again became depressed. He feltempty and lost, and frequently kicked to pieces anything that got in his way in hisgrandfather’s apartment. Alone in that hostile, unfamiliar neighbourhood, with no oneto turn to during his periods of melancholy and no one to share his rare moments of joy,he would often fall into despair. When these crises arose, he poured out his heart to hisdiary. Once, he sat up all night filling page after page with something he called ‘Secretsof a Writer’: ‘Suddenly my life has changed. I’ve been left high and dry in the mostdepressing place in Brazil: the city, the commercial centre of Rio. At night, no one.During the day, thousands of distant people. And the loneliness is becoming such thatI’ve begun to feel it’s like something alive and real, which fills every corner and everystreet. I, Paulo Coelho, aged nineteen, am empty-handed.’His proximity to the red light district meant that he became a regular client in thebrothels that lined the streets from the bottom of the Lapa to Mangue. It didn’t matterthat these women weren’t very elegant and bore no physical resemblance to the richgirls he fancied. He could talk about anything to a prostitute and realize all his secretfantasies without scandalizing anyone–even when these fantasies meant doingabsolutely nothing, as he recorded in his diary:Yesterday I went with the oldest woman in the area–and the oldest woman I’veslept with in my whole life (I didn’t screw her, I just paid to look). Her breastslooked like a sack with nothing in it and she stood there in front of me, naked,stroking her cunt with her hand. I watched her, unable to understand why shemade me feel both pity and respect. She was pure, extremely kind andprofessional, but she was a really old woman, you can’t imagine just how old.Perhaps seventy. She was French and had left a copy of France Soir lying onthe floor. She treated me with such care. She works from six in the evening toeleven o’clock at night; then she catches a bus home and there she’s arespectable old lady. No one says, Oh my God! I can’t think of her nakedbecause it makes me shudder and fills me with such a mixture of feelings. I’llnever forget this old woman. Very strange.While sometimes he would pay and not have sex, on other occasions he would have sexand pay nothing, or almost nothing (‘Yesterday I was on inspired form and I managed toget a prostitute without paying anything–in the end she took a sweater that I’d pinched"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"from a friend’). Then, for weeks on end, he devoted every page in his diary to his crazedlove for a young prostitute. One day, the woman disappeared with another client,without telling him, and once again he went crazy. He may have been an adult, but onlythe innocence of a boy in matters of love could explain his jealousy at having beenbetrayed by a prostitute. ‘I wanted to cry as I’ve never cried before, because my wholebeing resided in that woman,’ he moaned. ‘With her flesh I could keep loneliness at bayfor a while.’ On hearing that his loved one had returned and that she was revealingintimate facts about him to all and sundry, he wrote: ‘I’ve heard that she’s slanderingme...I’ve realized that as far as she’s concerned, I’m a nobody, a nothing. I’m going togive away the name of the woman to whom I gave everything that was pure in myputrefied being: Tereza Cristina de Melo.’During the day, Paulo continued to live the life of his dreams: girlfriends,rehearsals, study groups, debates about cinema and existentialism. Although he hadhardly set foot in his new college, he had managed to move up a year, which allowedhim to think of taking the entrance exam for a degree. On the few occasions when heappeared at the family home–usually in order to scrounge a meal or ask for money–hemade up stories in order to shock his parents, saying that he had been in the mostoutlandish places in Rio. ‘I read in the newspapers about the places frequented by free-living young people and lied, saying that I had been there, just to shock my father andmother.’ Although he almost never played his guitar, he took it with him everywhere,‘just to impress the girls!’When night fell, though, the bouts of melancholy and loneliness returned. Therecame a time when he could take them no more. For three months, night after night, hehad done battle with a constant nightmare, and he felt he had to take a step back. Hepacked up all his belongings in a box and, sad and humiliated, he asked his parents tohave him back in the house to which he had never imagined he would return."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9The great escapeTHE EASE WITH WHICH HE MIXED with women of all classes, from prostitutes in Mangueto elegant young bimbos at the Paissandu, gave everyone the impression that Paulo hadno doubts about his sexual proclivities. This, however, was merely an impression. Hislife in the world of the theatre, where homosexuality was practised freely, had aroused adoubt so secret that he didn’t even reveal it to his diary: did he have ‘sexual problems’,as his mother had suspected when she had first had him admitted to the clinic? Or, inplain language, was he homosexual? Although he was almost twenty, this was still adark, mysterious area for Paulo. Unlike most Brazilian boys of the time, he had had hisfirst sexual encounter with a woman, the sexually precocious and experienced Madá,rather than with a male friend. He had never felt the desire to have physical relationswith a man, and had never even fantasized about such an encounter. Several times,though, when he saw groups of homosexual friends talking during intervals inrehearsals, he tormented himself with troubling questions: ‘What if they’re right? Whatif their sexual choice is better than mine?’Life had taught him that it was better to be the first to jump into the icy river thanto suffer in line until it was his turn. Instead of continuing to torment himself withendless doubts, he knew that there was only one way to resolve the problem: try it out.When he read a text from Marx saying something like ‘practice is the deciding factor’,he interpreted it as a prompt to take action. One evening, when he was still living in hisgrandfather’s apartment in the city centre, he summoned up his courage and went roundthe various gay bars until, fortified by a few whiskies, he decided to take the plunge. Hewent up to a boy of his age, a professional, who was waiting for customers, and gotstraight to the point.‘Hi. How do you fancy going to bed with me?’Paulo was ready for anything, but certainly not the reply he got: ‘No. I don’t wantto.’Paulo felt as surprised as if he had been punched. How come? He was going to pay,after all! The boy turned his back on him and left him standing, glass in hand. When hetried again in another nightclub and received a second ‘No’, he brought his briefhomosexual experiment to an end. Weeks later, frantically engaged in work, heappeared to have forgotten the matter.While the career of Paulo Coelho the writer continued to be an evident failure, thesame could not be said about Coelho the playwright and producer. His first solo foray"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"into the world of the arts, in children’s theatre, was a production of a cinema classic,The Wizard of Oz. He not only adapted the script but also directed the play and casthimself as the Lion. Lacking funds for costly props and costumes, he simply paintedwhiskers on his face and stuck two cloth ears on his head; the tail was a rope sewn on tohis trousers, the end of which he would twist round his forefinger during the show.Almost the only thing he took from the film was the song ‘Somewhere Over theRainbow’. The remainder of the score was composed by Antônio Carlos Dias, orKakiko, a musician and actor with whom Paulo had shared a dressing room during theproduction of Capitães da Areia. To everyone’s surprise, The Wizard of Oz took inenough to cover the costs of the production and the salaries of actors and techniciansand made a profit–money that Paulo squirreled away for their next production. Havinghis name appear on the entertainment pages of the newspapers was also something akinto success: on one day in 1967, his name appeared in three different places in thecultural sections of the Rio press. At the Teatro de Arena he was the author and directorof O Tesouro do Capitão Berengundo [The Treasure of Captain Berengundo]; at theSanta Terezinha his name was on the posters for an adaptation of his Aladdin and HisMagic Lamp; and at the Teatro Carioca he was appearing as an actor in Walmir Ayala’sA Onça de Asas [The Winged Jaguar].Children’s plays brought in a little money, but it was only in adult theatre that hecould achieve the fame and prestige he craved. The production of Capitães da Areia hadmade this clear. In March, he was asked to act in a big production of Brecht and Weil’sThe Threepenny Opera. The show had been a great success in São Paulo with a cast offamous actors, and the Rio cast did not lag far behind, and was also full of well-knownstars. The play was to be the first production at the theatre in the Sala Cecília Meirelles.Paulo played a blind beggar, a role that needed little acting ability, but his name wouldbe printed in the programme alongside all the big names.After several weeks of rehearsal, they were ready for the first night. A few daysbefore, the company was invited to give a live performance of the play in the studios ofTV Rio, the most important of the city’s television stations. When it was due to go out,someone realized that the actor Oswaldo Loureiro, who was to sing the theme song, wasmissing. Since Paulo was the only one of the group who knew the words of ‘Mack theKnife’ by heart, he received the most exposure on the programme. The reasonablesuccess of the production established him further in his new profession.He was back in his parents’ house and the play was still showing when the Devil ofhomosexuality decided to tempt him again. This time the initiative was not his but thatof an actor of about thirty who was also working on the play. In fact the two had onlyexchanged a few words and looks, but one night, after the show, the older manapproached him.He came straight to the point: ‘Would you like to come back to my place and havesex?’"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Nervous and rather taken aback, Paulo said the first thing that came into his head:‘Yes, I would.’They spent the night together. Although much later, Paulo recalled feeling ratherdisgusted to find himself exchanging caresses with a man, he nevertheless had sex withhim, penetrating and being penetrated. Paulo returned home the following day evenmore confused than before. He had felt no pleasure and yet he still remained unsure asto whether or not he was homosexual. Some months later, he decided to try again andchose someone from among his stage friends. In the man’s studio flat in Copacabana, hefelt horribly embarrassed when his partner suggested they take a bath together. Hisfeelings of unease continued throughout the night, and they only managed to have fullsex when the sun was already coming up. Paulo Coelho was now convinced, once andfor all, that he was not homosexual.Despite his doubts about his sexuality, he continued to find success with women.He had left Márcia and finished his friendship with Renata, but he continued hisrelationship with Fabíola, who seemed to be growing more beautiful by the day. He hadbecome a gifted bigamist, though, having fallen for Genivalda, from Sergipe, the ugly,brilliant Geni whose witty comments delighted the intelligentsia who hung out at thePaissandu. After besieging her unsuccessfully for weeks, he finally took her away for aweekend at Uncle José’s house in Araruama. On their first night together, he wassurprised to hear Geni, who seemed such a woman of the world, asking him in a whisperto be gentle because this was her first sexual experience. Since there was no suitableplace for them to meet, the first months of their ‘honeymoon’ were awkward, but theywere fruitful: at the beginning of June, Geni telephoned him to say that she waspregnant with his child. Paulo immediately decided that he wanted the child, but had notime to say so, as she immediately announced that she was going to have an abortion.He suggested a meeting so that they could talk, but Geni was determined: she had madeher decision and, besides, she wanted to put an end to their relationship. She rang offand disappeared from his life as if she had never existed.Paulo entered another downward spiral. Upset by the news of the pregnancy andGeni’s sudden disappearance, he set about looking for her everywhere until he learnedthat she had returned to her hometown of Aracaju, where she was intending to have theabortion. Keen to dissuade her, but with no means of finding her when she was almost2,000 kilometres away, he once again succumbed to fits of depression, interrupted byshort periods of euphoria. Pages and pages of his diary, written during sleepless nights,reflect this:I breathe solitude, I wear solitude, I crap solitude. It’s awful. I’ve never felt soalone. Not even during the long bitter days of my adolescence. Not that solitudeis anything new. It’s just that I’m getting tired of it. Soon I’ll do somethingmad that will terrify the world."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"I want to write. But what for? Why? Alone, my brain fills with existentialproblems, and I can only make out one thing in all that noise and confusion: adesire to die.This rather melodramatic vein also appears in his moments of happiness. He recordedthese rare and short-lived moments of optimism with a total lack of modesty: ‘My hourto give birth has arrived, as foreseen in a poem I wrote in the clinic. This morning I wasborn, along with the morning light. The time has come for me to show the world who Iam.’In 1967, the world still did not know who Paulo Coelho was; indeed, it ran the riskof losing him, judging by his frequent bouts of depression and the insistence with whichhe spoke of death and suicide. At the end of June, after enduring another sleepless night,he had a sudden attack of rage. He put his diary away in the drawer, locked his bedroomdoor and began to break everything. He started with his guitar, which he smashed overhis desk with a crash that sounded like a bomb exploding. The neighbours, who at thattime, around six in the morning, had not yet got up, were astonished to hear the racketcoming from the Coelho household. He broke his portable red plastic tape recorder andhis short-wave radio and anything else he came across.There was nothing left to destroy, but his fury was not yet spent. He went over tohis bookcase and set to work on the ten volumes of his Sherlock Holmes collection. Heripped them up one by one and then went to the shelf containing books by Brazilianauthors and continued his destruction until the bedroom floor was covered in thetattered remains of books. He went into the small bathroom next door and, using thefingerboard of his guitar as a cudgel, smashed the mirror. When the noise stopped for amoment, he heard his father pounding on the door, demanding that he open up, but hewould not stop. He ripped down and tore into tiny pieces the two texts he had stuck onhis door–a prayer by St Francis of Assisi and the words of ‘Barbara’ by the French poetJacques Prévert, and then he did the same thing with the posters decorating his room:Goya’s La Maja Desnuda, Bosch’s Garden of Delights and The Crucifixion by Rubens.Panting, he saw that only one thing had remained intact: the white armchair where, ashe once wrote, he would sit and cry or look up at the starry sky. Having nothing hecould use to smash it, he opened the window and hurled it out into the garden at the sideof the house. It was only then, when there was nothing left standing or intact, that hedecided to open the door. He hardly had time to notice that it was no longer his fatherwho was knocking. Two male nurses held him down and one injected him with whatseemed to be a powerful sedative.When he opened his eyes, he recognized the peeling paint on the ceiling. He wasback lying on a bed on the ninth floor of the clinic. The first precaution the nurses hadtaken as soon as he came round from sedation was to take him to the liftmen and tellthem: ‘This is the patient who ran away from here last year. Take a good look at his face"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"and this time be more careful.’Nothing in the clinic had changed since his previous stays there. Except for Flávio,who had tried to kill himself with whisky and ether spray, they were all there, includingLuís Carlos, his companion in flight. The faces were the same as before, as was thesuffering. On the first day, Paulo was submitted to a session of electroshock therapy sostrong that when Fabíola came to visit him some hours later, he was still unconscious,drooling and with his face contorted by the violence of the electrical charges to hisbrain. In spite of the love and care shown him by his girlfriend–this time, Fabíola wasthe only person, apart from his parents, to visit him–he could not get the absent Geniand the baby out of his mind.A week after being admitted to the clinic, during which time he was subjected tothree electroshock sessions, Paulo was once again thinking of running away. And onceagain his chosen companion was Luís Carlos, who was unable to bear the routine of thehospital any longer. The opportunity arose on a day when a member of Dr Benjamim’steam was checking his mouth and noticed that a wisdom tooth was coming through. Hethought that he had found the cause of Paulo’s problems: ‘Now I know what’s wrong.It’s a tooth coming through and causing pressure in your head. That’s what’s makingyou agitated and causing your crises. I’m going to ask the dentist to take out the toothand then you’ll be all right.’While they were looking for a nurse to take him to the dental clinic, he found LuísCarlos and told him: ‘It’s now or never! They’re going to take me to the dentist and I’mgoing to try to escape. See if you can too. If all goes well, we’ll meet in an hour at thecafé opposite the clinic.’He walked down the paths separating the different clinic buildings, constantlywatched by the male nurse, who, when they reached the door of the consulting room,looked at his watch and agreed with the dentist that since the extraction would takeabout half an hour, he would go to the toilet and then return straight away to take thepatient back to the unit housing the mentally ill. However, the consultation lasted lessthan five minutes. After a quick examination, the dentist told him he could go: ‘I don’tknow who invented such a stupid story! Since when has a wisdom tooth made anyonemad? You can sit outside and wait for the nurse to take you back to your floor.’This was the moment. Paulo hurried along the corridors and, keeping his headdown, crossed the woods on the edge of the complex and joined the crowd of visitorsand doctors at the gate. Minutes later, he was free.He ran to the café on the corner of Rua Assunção and Rua Marquês de Olinda and,to his surprise, saw Luís Carlos waiting for him with a glass of beer in his hand–it wasall he could afford with the few coins he had in his pocket. They celebrated theirsuccess and decided to get out of the café before anyone on the ninth floor noticed theywere missing and came looking for them (security seems to have been somewhat laxthat day, since it was only two days later, on 9 July, that the doctors realized the two had"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"disappeared). As they were leaving, Paulo managed to sell his wristwatch at the bar,although since there was no time for haggling, he received only 300 new cruzeiros(US$380), less than half its true value. The fugitives walked three blocks along RuaMarquês de Olinda, sat on the grass and spent hours in silence, enjoying the deliciouspleasure of seeing the shimmering Urca beach with Sugar Loaf Mountain in thebackground. It was exactly the same view that they had from the windows of theasylum, only now there was no grille in front of them.Paulo told Luís Carlos what he was planning: ‘I’m going to the bus station to buy aticket to Aracaju. I need to find a girlfriend of mine who is or was expecting my baby. Ifyou want to come with me, the money from the watch is enough to pay for you, too.’Luís Carlos was surprised at the thought of such a long journey, but having nobetter plan and having nowhere to go, he accepted the invitation. As the bus did notleave until eight the following morning, the pair spent the night on the benches at thebus station. The tickets had cost them 80 cruzeiros, leaving more than enough money tobuy food on the long bus ride. Luís Carlos wanted to know how they were going tosurvive when they reached their destination, but Paulo reassured him, saying: ‘There arepeople there who will take care of that.’ After crossing the states of Rio de Janeiro,Minas Gerais and Bahia, with stops at fifteen towns along the way, two days later, onthe morning of 9 July 1967, they arrived in Aracaju. It was only then that Luís Carloslearned that Paulo had no address, telephone number or any other way of finding hisbeloved Genivalda in a town of 170,000 inhabitants. His sole local reference was thename of Mário Jorge Vieira, a young poet and militant member of the banned BrazilianCommunist Party (PCB).Thanks to the lies he invented, a day later, Paulo and his friend, whom heintroduced as ‘my dumb secretary’, were installed in journalist Marcos Mutti’scomfortable home, and he appeared in the social columns of the local press, describedeither as ‘university student and actor’ or as ‘young playwright from Rio’. Thesereferences were always accompanied by extravagant stories: ‘Mingling with the artisticcommunity of Aracaju is the theatre actor Paulo Coelho, who recently appeared in Rioin the play Oedipus Rex alongside Paulo Autran. It seems that Coelho has come toadmire our green landscape and to plant new seeds in the region’s almost non-existenttheatrical history.’After a week of searching, he lost all hope of finding Geni. He heard nothing of heruntil many years later, when he learned that she had indeed had an abortion and that,some time later, when still young, she had been run over and killed. Frustrated in theone objective that had taken him to Aracaju, he planned to return to Rio, but thehospitality he was receiving was such that he stayed on. Treated with the respectgranted to a star, he gave a long interview to the Gazeta de Sergipe, in which he waspresented to the newspaper’s readers: ‘A strange individual arrived here on the 9th.Long-haired, unshaven, thin, and rather odd-looking, but with lots of ideas in his head,"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"lots of hope and an enormous desire to propagate art throughout Brazil. He is, in short,an artist. A young man of twenty who has left his home (he is the son of one of the best-known families in Rio de Janeiro) for the love of art. His is a mind turned towardsHumanity.’Feeling himself to be at a safe distance (or protected perhaps by the impunitygranted to the mad, to children and to native Indians), Paulo suddenly grew courageousand made use of the piece in the newspaper in order, for the first time, to criticize themilitary dictatorship–or rather, even more dangerous, the then President of theRepublic, Marshal Artur da Costa e Silva. ‘I’m not going to keep quiet just becausesome superannuated marshal picks up a rifle and claims to be defending the morals andfreedom of a people who don’t even know what freedom is.’ This was starting to lookless like an interview and more like a manifesto, a call to arms. ‘I haven’t travelledthousands of kilometres to Aracaju in order to keep quiet. I won’t lie to myself or tothose around me.’ The result of this vehemence was that he was offered a space in thenewspaper to write a signed political article for the following Saturday’s edition.On the Friday, however, he discovered that there were two people in the city whowere looking for ‘the guy from Rio’, wanting to kill him. He was convinced that thesemust be Geni’s relatives, intent on defending their daughter’s honour by spilling theblood of her abuser, and his courage disappeared in a flash. He decided to make a runfor it and was just about to leave when Luís Carlos reminded him about the article hehad promised for the newspaper. Paulo opened up the leather bag he was wearing slungover his shoulder and took out a cutting from a Rio newspaper he had picked up on abench at the bus station in Vitória da Conquista, in Bahia, one of the fifteen stops on theway to Aracaju. He asked his hosts whether he could use their typewriter and copied,word for word, an article castigating the military dictatorship for havingdisenfranchised Brazilians. He kept the title and simply changed the author’s name tohis. Still with Luís Carlos, he spent the remainder of his money on two bus tickets toSalvador–the furthest his money would take him.Years later, furious to learn that they had been duped and the article plagiarized, thepeople in Sergipe who had met Paulo at the time gave a rather different account of hissudden departure from Aracaju. ‘He and his so-called dumb secretary didn’t take ashower for two weeks and smoked cannabis all day,’ recalls Ilma Fontes. ‘That’s whyPaulo Coelho was thrown out of Marcos Mutti’s house: for spending the day smokingcannabis in a strictly residential street.’ Two weeks without washing was not perhapsanything new in his life, but smoking cannabis was certainly not one of Paulo’s habitsin July 1967.When they got off the bus in the Salvador capital of Bahia without a penny in theirpockets, the two men walked 10 kilometres to the Obras Sociais Irmã Dulce, acharitable institution known throughout Brazil. After joining a long line of beggarsholding aluminum bowls for their daily soup ration, they went up to a small table,"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"where the poor were received individually by the nun, to whom Paulo referred in hisdiary as ‘Irma la Douce’. He explained to the sad-eyed little nun that he needed moneyto buy two bus tickets to Rio. The ragged appearance of these two mendicants spokevolumes, and so she asked no questions and wrote in tiny writing on a piece of paperbearing the name of the institution:These young men are requesting free transport to Rio.Irmã Dulce–21/7/67All they needed to do was to exchange the slip of paper at the bus station for twotickets. In Bahia, any piece of paper signed by the nun had the value of a voucher for aplate of food, having a relative taken into hospital or, as in their case, a bus ticket.Paulo spent the forty-hour journey from Salvador to Rio drawing up the synopsis ofa book about their escape and their journey to the northeast of the country. No–not justone book: in keeping with his megalomaniac temperament, he planned to write no fewerthan nine books, each with twelve chapters. By the end of the journey, he had filledfifteen pages of his diary with details of each volume and their chapter titles (‘Preparingthe Escape’ ‘My Travelling Companions’ ‘The General’s Son’ ‘My Long Hair andOther People’s Short Ideas’ ‘Pedro’s Pistol, or When the Bahians Shit Themselves’‘Sleeping in Kerosene Cans at 7° Centigrade’...), but the project never got any furtherthan that.At the Rio bus station, he and Luís Carlos sadly parted company. Once again, Paulowas going home and the ‘dumb’ man was on his way back to the clinic, where he was toremain, playing the part of madman, for as long as it took to gain his dreamed-ofpension.Less than a year later, Paulo was plunged into misery and despair again, and heagain smashed up his room. This time, when he opened his door, he found not the malenurses bearing syringes or straitjackets but a pleasant young doctor, who asked politely:‘May I come in?’It was the psychiatrist Dr Antônio Ovídio Clement Fajardo, who often used to sendpatients for treatment at the Dr Eiras clinic. When Lygia and Pedro had heard the firstsounds of things being broken in their son’s room, they had called Dr Benjamim, butwhen he couldn’t be found and since it was an urgent matter, they had contacted DrFajardo. When he spoke on the telephone to Pedro, the doctor had asked for basicinformation about Paulo.‘Is he armed?’‘No.’‘Is he an alcoholic?’‘No.’"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"‘Is he a drug addict?’‘No.’This made matters simpler.Fajardo asked again: ‘May I come in?’Hearing this unusual question repeated, Paulo didn’t know how to respond. ‘Comein? But haven’t you come to take me to the clinic?’The doctor replied: ‘Only if you want me to. But you haven’t answered myquestion: may I come in?’Seated on the bed, the doctor looked around the room, as though assessing theextent of the damage, and continued quite naturally: ‘You’ve broken everything,haven’t you? Excellent.’Paulo couldn’t understand what was going on. The doctor went on, explaining inprofessorial tones: ‘What you’ve destroyed is your past. That’s good. Now that it’s nolonger here, let’s begin to think about the future, all right? My suggestion is that youstart coming to see me twice a week so that we can talk about your future.’Paulo was astonished. ‘But doctor, I’ve just smashed up my room again. Aren’t yougoing to send me to the clinic?’The doctor replied dispassionately: ‘Everyone has their mad side. I probably do, butyou don’t put people away just like that. You’re not mentally ill.’Only after this episode did peace return to the Coelho household. Much later, hewrote: ‘I think my parents were convinced I was a hopeless case and preferred to keepan eye on me and to support me for the rest of my life. They knew I would get into “badcompany” again, but it didn’t enter their heads to have me re-admitted to the clinic.’The problem was that their son was not prepared to continue living under parentalcontrol. He was ready to accept anything but a return to his grandfather’s depressingstudio flat in the city centre. The short-term solution, which would last for a fewmonths, came once again from his grandparents. Some years earlier, Tuca and Lilisahad moved into a house near by, which had over the garage a small apartment with abedroom, bathroom and independent entrance. If Paulo wished–and if his father was inagreement–their grandson could move in there.Their grandson wanted this so much that, before his father had time to say no, hehad moved everything that remained from the wreck of his room into his new home–hisbed, his desk, his few clothes and his typewriter, which he had carefully protected fromhis frenzy. He soon realized that the apartment was like a gateway to paradise: given hisgrandparents’ extreme liberality, he could come and go as he pleased and, within thebroad limits of decency, he could entertain whomever he wanted, day or night. Hisgrandparents’ tolerance was such that, years later, Paulo vaguely recalled that it wasprobably there that he tried cannabis for the first time.With no control over their son and with his grandparents making no attempt tocontrol his behaviour either, some months later, Paulo’s father suggested he should"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"move somewhere more comfortable. If interested, he could go back to living alone, notin Tuca’s studio but in a comfortable apartment Pedro had been given in payment for abuilding he had constructed in Rua Raimundo Correa in Copacabana. Paulo wassuspicious of this generosity, and discovered that the offer concealed another reason:his father wanted to get rid of a tenant who was frequently late in paying his rent. Sincethe law said that a contract could only be broken by the landlord if the dwelling was tobe used by a close relative of the owner, this was the solution to two problems, bothPaulo’s and his father’s. Like almost any offer coming from Pedro, it had its drawbacks:Paulo could use only one of the three bedrooms, since the other two were permanentlylocked and empty. Also, access was always to be by the door in the basement, since themain entrance was to be kept locked and the key to remain with his father. Paulo hadonly to go to a local second-hand shop to buy some lamps and a bookcase and the placewas ready to live in.Paulo retained happy memories of the days he spent in Rua Raimundo Correa.Other affairs with other girls began and ended, but Fabíola remained faithful to him.She swallowed her jealousy and, as she later recalled, put up with the ‘Renatas, Genisand Márcias...but in the difficult times, I was there for him, it was pure love–purelove.’ Many years later, when he was famous, Paulo recalled that time with nostalgia: ‘Iexperienced a period of enormous happiness, enjoying the freedom I needed in order,finally, to live the “artist’s life”. I stopped studying and devoted myself exclusively tothe theatre and to going to bars frequented by intellectuals. For a whole year, I didexactly what I wanted. That was when Fabíola really came into my life.’Now a full-time playwright–he had managed to complete his course at Guanabara,but had no plans as yet to take the university entrance exam–he turned the dining roomof his new apartment into a workshop for scenery, costumes, compositions andrehearsals. He annoyed his neighbours by painting in Italian over the front door–whichhe never used–the words written above the gates of Dante’s Inferno: ‘Lasciate ognisperanza, voi che entrate’ [‘Abandon hope all ye who enter here’]. He translated plays,directed and worked as an actor. The more successful productions made up for thefailures, and so he was able to live without depending exclusively on support from hisparents. When he needed more funds, he tried to make money at poker and snookertables and by betting on horses at the Jockey Club.At the end of 1968, he resolved to try the only aspect of theatre he had not yetworked on: production. He adapted the classic Peter Pan, which he wanted to direct andin which he also wanted to perform, but he was shocked to find that his savings were notnearly enough to cover the production’s costs. He was still pondering how to resolve theproblem when Fabíola came to his apartment one night, opened her bag and took outbundles of notes in rubber bands–more than 5,000 cruzeiros (US$11,600), which shescattered over the bed, explaining: ‘This is my present for your production of PeterPan.’"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Fabíola told him that as she was about to turn eighteen, she had decided to tell hermother, grandmother and all her other relatives and friends that instead of clothes andpresents she would prefer money. She had contacted people everywhere–her mother’srich clients and godparents whom she hadn’t seen for years–and here was the result: thebundles on the bed were not a fortune, but the money was more than enough to makeputting on the play a viable proposition. Paulo was overwhelmed by the gift: ‘Onegirlfriend swapped me for two dresses and now you’ve exchanged all the dresses andpresents for me. Your action has entirely changed my view of women.’Fabíola not only got the money for the production but also sold advertising space inthe programme and came to an agreement with the restaurants around the Teatro SantaTerezinha in the Botanical Gardens: in exchange for their names being printed on anyadvertising material, they would allow the actors and technicians to have dinner forfree. Paulo repaid all he owed her by inviting her to take the title role. He was to beCaptain Hook. With a score by Kakiko, Peter Pan played to packed houses throughoutits run, which meant that every cent invested was recovered. And contrary to the notionthat says that public success means critical failure, the play went on to win a prize at thefirst Children’s Theatre Festival in the state of Guanabara. Paulo’s dream remained thesame–to be a great writer–but meanwhile, he had no alternative but to live by thetheatre. These cheering results made him decide to turn professional, and soon he was aproud member of the Brazilian Society of Theatre Writers (SBAT).In 1969, he was invited to work as an actor in the play Viúva porém Honesta [AWidow but Honest], by Nelson Rodrigues. In a break in rehearsals, he was drinking abeer in the bar beside the Teatro Sérgio Porto when he noticed that he was beingwatched by an attractive blonde woman seated at the counter. He pretended to lookaway, but when he turned round again, there she was, with her eyes fixed on him andwith a discreet smile on her lips. This flirtation cannot have lasted more than tenminutes, but she made such an impression on Paulo that he wrote in his diary: ‘I can’tsay how it all started. She appeared suddenly. I went in and immediately felt herlooking at me. Despite the crowd, I knew that she had her eyes fixed on me and I didn’thave the courage to look straight back at her. I had never seen her before. But when Ifelt her gaze something happened. It was the beginning of a love story.’The beautiful mysterious blonde was Vera Prnjatovic Richter, eleven years Paulo’ssenior, who at the time was trying to end her fifteen-year marriage to a richindustrialist. She was always well dressed, she had a car–which was still fairly rareamong women at the time–and she lived in a huge apartment in one of the mostexpensive areas of Brazil, Avenida Delfim Moreira, in Leblon. From Paulo’s point ofview she had only one obvious defect–she was going out with the actor Paulo Elísio, abearded Apollo known for his bad temper and for being a karate black belt. However,the feelings recorded in his diary were to prove stronger than any martial arts."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10VeraBRAZIL BEGAN 1969 immersed in the most brutal dictatorship of its entire history. On13 December 1968, the President of the Republic, Artur da Costa e Silva–the‘superannuated marshal’ to whom Paulo had referred in his interview–had passedInstitutional Act number 5, the AI-5, which put paid to the last remaining vestiges offreedom following the military coup of 1964. Signed by the President and countersignedby all his ministers, including the Minister of Health, Leonel Miranda, the owner of theDr Eiras clinic, the AI-5 suspended, among other things, the right to habeas corpus andgave the government powers to censor the press, the theatre and books, as well asclosing down the National Congress.It was not only Brazil that was about to erupt. In its sixth year of war in Vietnam,where more than half a million soldiers had been sent, the United States had elected thehawkish Richard Nixon as president. In April 1968, the black civil right’s leader MartinLuther King, Jr, had been assassinated, and sixty-three days later it was the turn ofRobert Kennedy. One of the symbols of counterculture was the musical Hair, in which,at one point, the actors appeared naked on stage. In May, French students had occupiedthe Sorbonne and turned Paris into a battlefield, forcing General Charles de Gaulle tohold talks with the French military chiefs in Baden-Baden, Germany. This worldwidefever had crossed the Iron Curtain and reached Czechoslovakia in the form of thePrague Spring, a liberalizing plan proposed by the Secretary General of the CzechCommunist Party, Alexander Dubček, which was crushed in August by the tanks of theWarsaw Pact, the Soviet Union’s military alliance with its political satellites.In Brazil, opposition to the dictatorship was beginning to grow. Initially, this tookthe form of peaceful student marches, in which Paulo rarely participated and, when hedid so, it was more for fun and for the adventure of ‘confronting the police’ than as anact of political commitment. The political temperature rose with a rash of strikes calledby workers in São Paulo and Minas Gerais, and reached alarming levels when themilitary intelligence services detected a growth in the number of guerrilla groups,which the regime loosely termed ‘terrorists’. By the end of the year, there were, in fact,at least four armed urban guerrilla organizations: the Vanguarda ArmadaRevolucionária (VAR-Palmares), Ação Libertadora Nacional (ALN), VanguardaPopular Revolucionária (VPR) and the Comando de Libertação Nacional (Colina). TheBrazilian Communist Party, which took its inspiration from the Chinese CommunistParty, had sent its first militants to Xambioá, in the north of Goiás (now on the frontier"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"with the state of Tocantins), to mount a rural guerrilla assault in the region of theAraguaia River, on the edge of the Amazon rain forest. The extreme left attacked banksand set off bombs in barracks, while the extreme right organized attacks on one of themost visible centres of opposition to the regime: the theatre. Theatres in São Paulo andRio were attacked or destroyed and there were an increasing number of arrests at streetdemonstrations as well as arrests of prominent people such as the ex-governor ofGuanabara and civil leader of the 1964 coup, Carlos Lacerda, the composers CaetanoVeloso and Gilberto Gil, and the journalist Carlos Heitor Cony, whose article Paulo hadplagiarized in Aracaju.Although he boasted of being ‘the communist in the group’, and although he was awitness to the violence being perpetrated on his profession–he was, after all, aplaywright now and a member of the theatre union–Paulo seemed quietly indifferent tothe political storm ravaging Brazil. As with the military coup, the new law and itsconsequences didn’t merit a mention in his diaries. The first words he wrote in 1969 arerevealing as to the focus of his energies: ‘It’s New Year’s Day. I spent the evening withadulterers, homosexuals, lesbians and cuckolds.’In 1964, he could have attributed his lack of interest in politics to his youth, butnow he was nearly twenty-two, the average age of most of those leading the politicaland cultural movements rocking the country. If any important change was occurring inhis life, it was due not to the political maelstrom Brazil found itself in but to his newpassion, Vera Richter.Petite, blonde and elegant, she had been born in 1936 in Belgrade, the capital of thethen kingdom of Yugoslavia (now the capital of Serbia), the daughter of a wealthylandowning family. Until the age of twenty, she had lived a normal upper-class life;then, when she was in her first year at the theatre studies department of the university,she began to sense political changes occurring across Central Europe. That, and thecollectivization program begun in Yugoslavia by Tito, seemed to indicate that it wastime for the rich to leave the country.Since they had friends living in Rio de Janeiro, the Prnjatovic family–widowedmother, elder sister and Vera–decided this was to be their destination. Her mother andsister went first, and it was only some months later, when they were settled inCopacabana, that they sent a ticket for Vera. Speaking only English and the Italianatedialect of the area in which she had lived, she felt uncomfortable in Brazil. She endedup agreeing to a marriage arranged by her family–to a Yugoslav millionaire twelveyears her senior. She recalled years later that even those who didn’t know her wellnoticed how incompatible the two were. Like most twenty-year-old girls, she likeddancing, sports and singing, whereas her husband was shy and quiet and, when hewasn’t running his import/export business, loved reading and listening to classicalmusic.When her eyes met Paulo’s that night in the theatre bar, Vera’s marriage was"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"merely a formality. She and her husband lived under the same roof, but were no longer acouple. She had been attracted to the Teatro Carioca by an announcement in thenewspaper saying that a young director from Bahia, Álvaro Guimarães, was selectingstudents for a drama course. Almost four decades later, she recalls that her firstimpression of Paulo was not exactly flattering. ‘He looked like Professor Abronsius, thescientist with a big head in Roman Polanski’s film Dance of the Vampires– anenormous head on a tiny body. Ugly, bony, big lips and protruding eyes, Paulo was nobeauty.’ But he had other charms: ‘Paulo was a Don Quixote! He was crazy. Everythingseemed easy for him, everything was simple. He lived in the clouds, he never touchedthe ground. But his one obsession was to be someone. He would do anything to besomeone. That was Paulo.’At the time of Vera’s arrival on the scene, Paulo’s relationship with Fabíola wasdoomed anyway, but it finally ended when she caught him with Vera. Fabíola suspectedthat Paulo was secretly meeting a young Dutch actress who had appeared duringrehearsals and she decided to find out if her suspicions were true. One night, she sat onthe doorstep of the apartment in Rua Raimundo Correa and did not move until late inthe morning when he finally left with Vera. Deeply hurt, she ended the affair. Somemonths later, she scandalized Lygia and Pedro, to whom she had become quite close, byappearing nude on the cover of the satirical weekly Pasquim.As Paulo was to recall some years later, it was the experienced Vera who reallytaught him how to make love, to speak a little English and to dress a little better. Butshe could not help him overcome the trauma of Araruama: he still shook at the merethought of driving a car. Their convergence of tastes and interests extended to theirprofessional lives, and Vera’s money was the one thing that had been lacking in Paulo’sattempts to become immersed in the theatre. He divided his time between hisCopacabana apartment and Vera’s luxurious apartment in Leblon, where he would sleepalmost every night, and where he bashed away for weeks on end at his typewriter untilhe was able to announce proudly to his partner that he had completed his first play foradults, O Apocalipse [The Apocalypse]. The couple seemed made for each other. Veranot only understood the entire play (a feat achieved by very few) but liked it so muchthat she offered to put it on professionally, acting as its producer–the person investingthe money–while Paulo would be the director.Everything went so well that, at the end of April 1969, the critics and editors of thearts sections of newspapers received an invitation to the preview and a copy of theprogramme listing the cast, in which Vera had the star part. Paulo’s friend Kakiko, whohad recently qualified as an odontologist and divided his time between his dentalpractice and his music, was to write the score.Along with their invitation and the programme, journalists and critics received apress release written in pretentious, obscure language but which gave some idea of whatThe Apocalypse would be about. ‘The play is a snapshot of the present moment, of the"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"crisis in human existence, which is losing all its individual characteristics in favour of amore convenient stereotype, since it dogmatizes thought,’ the blurb began, and itcontinued in the same incomprehensible vein. It then promised a great revolution inmodern drama: the total abolition of characters. The play began with scenes from adocumentary on the Apollo 8 mission to the moon, after which the cast performed dancethat was described as ‘tribal with oriental influences’. Actors followed one another onto the stage, spouting excerpts from Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound, Shakespeare’sJulius Caesar and the Gospels. At the end, before hurling provocative remarks at theaudience, each actor acted himself, revealing traumatic events in his childhood.The Apocalypse meant that Paulo would, for the first time, experience the thing thatwould persecute him for the rest of his life: negative criticism. On the days thatfollowed the preview, the play was slated in every Rio newspaper. The Apocalypse wasas big a disaster with the public as it was with the critics. It played for only a few weeksand left a large hole in the accounts of Paulo’s first joint initiative with Vera–a hole thatshe quickly decided to fill.The production coincided with an important change in their life as a couple. Vera’smarriage had rapidly deteriorated, but since her husband continued to live in theirshared apartment, she decided to put an end to that rather awkward situation and movewith her lover to a place that had become a symbolic address in the counterculturemovement in Rio at the end of the 1960s: Solar Santa Terezinha. Originally created as anight shelter for beggars, the Solar was a vast rectangular building with a centralcourtyard around which people had their bedrooms. It had the look of a large, decadentrefuge, but it was considered ‘hip’ to live there. In the majority of cases each tenant hadto share a bathroom with half a dozen other residents, but Paulo and Vera occupied asuite–a room with a bathroom–for which the monthly rent was about 200 cruzeiros(US$210).At the end of July 1969, they decided to do something different. In the middle ofAugust, the Brazilian football team was going to play Paraguay in Asunción in a WorldCup qualifier, the finals of which were to be held in Mexico in 1970. Although hewasn’t that interested in football, one Sunday, Paulo thrilled his foreign girlfriend bytaking her to a match between Flamengo and Fluminense at the packed Maracanãstadium. Vera was mesmerized and began to take an interest in the sport, and it was shewho suggested that they drive to Paraguay to watch the match. Paulo didn’t even knowthat Brazil was going to play, but he loved the idea and started making plans.He immediately discounted the idea of just the two of them driving the almost2,000 kilometres to Asunción, a marathon journey on which Vera would be the onlydriver, since he had still not summoned up the courage to learn to drive. The solutionwas to call on two other friends for the adventure: the musician-dentist Kakiko andArnold Bruver, Jr, a new friend from the theatre. They thought of Kakiko for anotherreason too: as well as being able to drive, he could guarantee hospitality for all in"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Asunción, in the home of a Paraguayan girlfriend of his father’s. Bruver, like almost allthose in Paulo’s circle, was an unusual fellow. The son of a Latvian father and aGalician mother, he was thirty-three, a dancer, musician, actor and opera singer, andhad been ejected from the navy, in which he had reached the rank of captain, for allegedsubversion. It was only after accepting the invitation that Arnold revealed that hecouldn’t drive either. The next precaution was to ask Mestre Tuca, who had travelledwith Lilisa by car to Foz do Iguaçu, on the frontier with Paraguay, to give them a routewith suggestions of places to fill up the car with petrol, have meals and sleep.On the cold, sunny morning of Thursday, 14 August, the four got into Vera’s whiteVolkswagen. The journey passed without incident, with Vera and Kakiko taking turns atthe wheel every 150 kilometres. It was evening when the car stopped at the door of thesmall hotel in Registro in the state of São Paulo. After twelve hours on the road theyhad covered 600 kilometres, about a third of the total distance. The locals eyed anystrangers with understandable suspicion. Since the Department of Political and SocialOrder (the political police of the time, known as Dops) had disbanded the Student UnionCongress some months earlier in Ibiúna, 100 kilometres from there, the small towns inthe region were often visited by strangers and the locals had no way of telling if theywere police or something else entirely. However, the four travellers were so tired thatthere was no time for their presence to arouse anyone’s curiosity, for, on arriving, theywent straight to bed.On the Friday, they woke early, because the next stretch of the journey was thelongest and they hoped to cover it in just a day. If all went well, by suppertime theywould be in Cascavel, in the western region of Paraná, a 750-kilometre drive from there,and the last stop before reaching Asunción. But all did not go well: they were sloweddown by the number of trucks on the road. The result was that, by ten o’clock that night,they were all starving and still had 200 kilometres to go.It was at this point that Vera stopped the car in a lay-by and asked Kakiko to get outto see whether there was a problem with one of the tyres, because the car seemed to beskidding. As there was no sign of anything wrong, they decided that it must be the thickmist covering the area that was making the road slippery. Kakiko suggested that Verashould sit in the back and rest while he drove the rest of the way to Cascavel. Aftertravelling for a further hour, he stopped at a petrol station to fill up. All their expenseswere to be shared among the four, but when Vera looked for her purse, she realized thatshe had lost her bag with her money and all her documents, including her drivinglicence and car registration papers. She concluded that she must have dropped it whenshe had handed over the driving to Kakiko. They had no alternative but to go back to theplace where they had stopped, 100 kilometres back, to try to find the bag. It took threehours to get there and back, without success. They looked everywhere, with the help ofthe car headlights, but there was no sign of the bag and no one in the local bars andpetrol stations had seen it either. Convinced that this was a bad omen, a sign, Paulo"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"suggested that they turn back, but the other three disagreed. They continued the journeyand didn’t reach Cascavel until early on the Saturday morning, by which time the carhad a problem–the clutch wasn’t working, and so it was impossible to carry on.Because of the Brazil game, on the following day, almost everything in Cascavelwas closed, including all the garages. They decided that they would continue on toAsunción by bus. They bought tickets to Foz do Iguaçu and, as Vera had no documents,they had to mingle with the crowds of tourists and supporters in order to cross thebridge separating Brazil from Paraguay. Once in Paraguay, they took another bus to thecapital.Immediately after settling into the home of Kakiko’s father’s girlfriend, theydiscovered that all tickets for the match had been sold, but they didn’t mind. They spentthe weekend visiting tribes of Guarani Indians on the outskirts of the city and takingtedious boat trips on the river Paraguay. On the Monday morning they began to thinkabout getting the car repaired in Cascavel. With the disappearance of Vera’s bag, theywould have to take special care on the return journey: without the car documents theymustn’t get caught breaking any laws and, without Vera’s money, their expenses wouldhave to be divided by three, which meant eating less and spending the night in cheaperplaces. They rejigged Tuca’s route map and decided to go to Curitiba, where they wouldsleep and try to get a duplicate copy of the car documents and of Vera’s driving licence.At about ten at night–none of them remembers quite what time it was–hungerforced them to stop before reaching Curitiba. They parked the car by a steak house, justoutside Ponta Grossa, having driven about 400 kilometres. To save money they used aruse they had been practising since Vera had lost her bag: she and Paulo would sit aloneat the table and ask for a meal for two. When the food arrived, Kakiko and Arnoldwould appear and share the meal with them.Duly fed and watered, they were just about to resume their journey when a group ofsoldiers belonging to the Military Police entered the restaurant, armed with machineguns.The man who appeared to be the head of the group went over to their table andasked: ‘Is the white VW with Guanabara number plates parked outside yours?’Kakiko, who was the only one officially allowed to drive, replied: ‘Yes, it’s ours.’When the soldier asked to see the certificate of ownership, Kakiko explained indetail, watched by his terrified friends, how Vera had left her bag next to the car doorand lost her purse and everything in it, and how the plan was to stay in Curitiba and seewhether they could get a duplicate of the lost documents.The man listened, incredulous, then said: ‘You’re going to have to explain all thisto the police chief. Come with us.’They were taken to a police station, where they spent the night in the freezing cold,sitting on a wooden bench until six in the morning, when the police chief arrived to givethem the news himself: ‘You are accused of terrorist activities and carrying out a bank"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"raid. It’s nothing to do with me now–it’s up to the army.’Although none of them had been taking much interest in the matter, the politicalsituation had been getting worse in Brazil in the previous few months. Since thepublication of the new law, AI-5, in December 1968, more than two hundred universityprofessors and researchers had been compulsorily suspended, arrested or exiled. In theNational Congress, 110 Members of Parliament and four senators had been stripped oftheir mandate and, elsewhere, about five hundred people had been removed from publicoffice, either directly or indirectly accused of subversion. With the removal of threeministers from the Supreme Federal Tribunal, violence in the country had reached itsheight. In January, Captain Carlos Lamarca had deserted an army barracks in Quitaúna,a district of Osasco, taking with him a vehicle containing sixty-three automatic guns,three sub-machine guns and other munitions for the urban guerrilla movement. In SãoPaulo, the recently nominated governor Abreu Sodré had created Operação Bandeirantes(Oban), a unit that combined police and members of the armed forces, which wasintended to crush any opposition. It immediately became a centre for the torture ofenemies of the regime.Two days before Paulo and his friends had been arrested, four guerrillas armed withmachine guns–three men and a blonde woman–and driving a white Volkswagen withGuanabara number plates had attacked a bank and a supermarket in Jandaia do Sul, atown 100 kilometres north of Ponta Grossa. The police were now assuming that Pauloand his friends must be those people. Shivering with cold and fear, the four were takenin a prison van guarded by heavily armed soldiers to the headquarters of the 13thBattalion of the Armed Infantry (BIB), in the district of Uvaranas, on the other side ofthe city. Scruffy, dirty and cold, they climbed out of the van and found themselves in anenormous courtyard where hundreds of recruits were doing military exercises.Half an hour after being placed in separate cells, made to undress and then dressagain, interrogation began. The first to be called was Kakiko, who was taken to a cellfurnished only with a table and two chairs, one of which was occupied by a tall, dark,well-built man in boots and combat gear with his name embroidered on his chest: ‘Maj.Índio’. Major Índio ordered Kakiko to take a chair and then sat down in front of him.Then he spoke the words that Kakiko would remember for the rest of his life: ‘So far noone has laid a finger on you, but pay very close attention to what I’m going to say. Ifyou give just one bit of false information–just one–I’m going to stick these two fingersin your left eye, and rip out your eyeball and eat it. Your right eye will be preserved sothat you can witness the scene. Understood?’The first of the crimes of which Paulo and his friends were accused–an armed raidon a supermarket in Jandaia do Sul–had left no victims. But during the attempted raidon a bank in the same city, the guerrillas had shot the manager. The similarities betweenthe four travellers and the guerrillas appeared to justify the suspicions of the military inPonta Grossa. Although the raiders used nylon stockings to cover their faces, there was"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"no doubt that they were three white men, one of them with long hair, like Paulo, and ablonde woman, like Vera, and that, like Paulo and his friends, they were driving a whiteVolkswagen with Guanabara number plates. Paulo’s map also seemed to the authoritiesto be too careful and professional to have been produced by a grandfather eager to helphis hippie grandson. Besides this, the chosen route could not have been morecompromising: information from military intelligence had reported that the group ledby Captain Carlos Lamarca might be preparing to establish a guerrilla nucleus in Valedo Ribeira–which was on the very route the friends had taken on their journey toAsunción. A dossier containing files on all four plus information on the car had beensent to the security agencies in Brasilia, Rio and São Paulo.Besides their illegal arrest and the ever more terrifying threats, none of the four hadas yet experienced physical violence. Major Índio had repeated his promise to eat one oftheir eyeballs to each of the others, insisting that this was not a mere empty threat: ‘Upto now no one has laid a finger on you. We’re giving you food and blankets on theassumption that you are innocent. But don’t forget: if there’s a word of a lie in yourstatements, I’ll carry out my promise. I’ve done it before to other terrorists and I’ll haveno problems doing the same to you.’The situation worsened on the Tuesday morning, when some of the supermarketemployees were taken to the barracks to identify the suspects. With Paulo and Vera, theidentification was made through a small opening in the cell doors, without theirknowing that they were being observed. In the case of Arnold and Kakiko, the doorswere simply opened, allowing the people–who were as terrified as the prisoners–a quicklook inside. Although the assailants had had their faces covered when committing thecrimes, and despite the very cursory identification procedure, in unlit cells, thewitnesses were unanimous: those were the four who had committed the crime. Theinterrogations became more intense and more intimidating, and the same questionswere repeated four, five, six, ten times. Vera and Arnold had to explain over and over tothe succession of civil and military authorities who entered the cells to ask questionsjust what a Yugoslav woman and a naval officer suspended for subversion were doing inthe area. Coelho cannot recall how often he had to answer the same questions: after sucha long journey, how come they hadn’t even bothered to see the match? How had Veramanaged to cross the frontier with Paraguay in both directions without documents?Why did the map suggest so many alternative places to stay and fill up the car withpetrol? Paulo commented to Arnold, in one of the rare moments they were alone in thesame cell, that this was a Kafkaesque nightmare: even the presence of his nebulizer torelieve his asthma attacks had to be explained in detail several times.The nightmare continued for five days. On the Saturday morning, armed soldiersentered the cells and gave orders for the prisoners to collect their things because theywere being ‘moved’. Squashed in the back of the same olive-green van, the four weresure that they were going to be executed. When the vehicle stopped minutes later, much"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"to their surprise, they got out in front of a bungalow surrounded by a garden of carefullytended roses. At the top of the stairs, a smiling soldier with grey hair and a bouquet offlowers in his hands was waiting for them. This was Colonel Lobo Mazza, whoexplained to the dazed travellers that everything had been cleared up and that they wereindeed innocent. The flowers, which the officer had picked himself, were given to Veraby way of an apology. The colonel explained the reasons for their imprisonment–thegrowth of the armed struggle, their similarity to the assailants in Jandaia do Sul, thedrive through Vale do Ribeira–and he made a point of asking each whether they hadsuffered any physical violence. Seeing their dirty, ragged appearance, he suggested theyuse the bathroom in the house and then offered them canapés accompanied by somegood Scotch whisky. So that they would have no problems getting back to Rio, theywere given a safe-conduct pass signed by Colonel Mazza himself. The journey wasover."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11The marijuana yearsONCE HE WAS BACK IN RIO, Paulo entered the 1970s propelled by a new fuel: cannabis.This would be followed by other drugs, but initially he only used cannabis. Once theyhad tried the drug together for the first time, he and Vera became regular consumers.Being new to the experience, they had little knowledge of its effects, and before startingto smoke they would lock away any knives or other sharp household objects in a drawer‘to prevent any accidents’, as she said. They smoked every day and on any pretext: inthe afternoon so that they could better enjoy the sunsets, at night to get over the fact thatthey felt as if they were sleeping on the runway of Santos Dumont airport, with thedeafening noise of aeroplanes taking off and landing only a few metres away. And, ifthere was no other reason, they smoked to allay boredom. Paulo recalled later havingspent days in a row under the effect of cannabis, without so much as half an hour’sinterval.Completely free of parental control, he had become a true hippie: someone who notonly dressed and behaved like a hippie but thought like one too. He had stopped being acommunist–before he had ever become one–when he was lectured in public by amilitant member of the Brazilian Communist Party for saying that he had really lovedthe film Les Parapluies de Cherbourg–a French musical starring Catherine Deneuve.With the same ease with which he had crossed from the Christianity of the Jesuits toMarxism, he was now a devout follower of the hippie insurrection that was spreadingthroughout the world. ‘This will be humanity’s final revolution,’ he wrote in his diary.‘Communism is over, a new brotherhood is born, mysticism is invading art, drugs arean essential food. When Christ consecrated the wine, he was consecrating drugs. Drugsare a wine of the most superior vintage.’After spending a few months at the Solar Santa Terezinha, he and Vera rented,together with a friend, a two-bedroom apartment in Santa Teresa, a bohemian district atthe top of a hill near the Lapa, in the centre of the city, which had a romantic littletramway running through it that clanked as it went up the hill. In between moves, theyhad to live for some weeks in the Leblon apartment, along with Vera’s husband, whohad not yet moved out.Cannabis usually causes prolonged periods of lethargy and exhaustion in heavyusers, but the drug seemed to have the opposite effect on Paulo. He became positivelyhyperactive and in the first months of 1970, he adapted for the stage and produced TheWar of the Worlds by H.G. Wells, took part in theatre workshops with the playwright"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Amir Haddad and entered both the Paraná Short Story Competition and the Esso Prizefor Literature. He even found time to write three plays: Os Caminhos do Misticismo[The Paths of Mysticism], about Father Cícero Romão Batista, a miracle worker fromthe northeast of Brazil; A Revolta da Chibata: História à Beira de um Caís [The ChibataRevolt: History on the Dockside], about the sailors’ revolt in Rio de Janeiro in 1910;and Os Limites da Resistência [The Limits of Resistance], which was a dramatizedcompilation of various texts. He sent the latter off to the National Book Institute, anorgan of the federal government, but it failed to get beyond the first obstacle, theReading Commission. His book fell into the hands of the critic and novelist Octavio deFaria who, while emphasizing its good points, sent the originals straight to the archiveswith the words:I won’t deny that this strange book, The Limits of Resistance, left mecompletely perplexed. Even after reading it, I cannot decide which literarygenre it belongs to. It claims to comprise ‘Eleven Fundamental Differences’,bears an epigraph by Henry Miller, and sets out to ‘explain’ life. It containsdigressions, surrealist constructions, descriptions of psychedelic experiences,and all kinds of games and jokes. It is a hotchpotch of ‘fundamentaldifferences’, which, while undeniably well written and intelligent, does notseem to me the kind of book that fits our criteria. Whatever Sr. Paulo Coelhode Souza’s literary future may be, it’s the kind of work that ‘avant-garde’publishers like, in the hope of stumbling across a ‘genius’, but not thepublishers of the National Book Institute.At least he had the consolation of being in good company. The same ReadingCommission also rejected at least two books that would become classics of Brazilianliterature: Sargento Getúlio, which was to launch the writer João Ubaldo Ribeiro inBrazil and the United States, and Objeto Gritante, by Clarice Lispector, which was laterto be published as Água Viva.As if some force were trying to deflect him from his idée fixe of becoming a writer,drama continued to offer Paulo more recognition than prose. Although he had highhopes for his play about Father Cícero, foreseeing a brilliant future for it, only ARevolta da Chibata went on to achieve any success. He entered it in the prestigiousConcurso Teatro Opinião, more because he felt that he should than with any hope ofwinning. The prize offered was better than any amount of money: the winning playwould be performed by the members of the Teatro Opinião, which was the most famousof the avant-garde theatre groups in Brazil. When Vera called to tell him that A Revoltahad come second, Paulo reacted angrily: ‘Second? Shit! I always come second.’ Firstprize had gone to Os Dentes do Tigre [Tiger’s Teeth] by Maria Helena Kühner, who was"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"also starting out on her career.However, if his objective was fame, he had nothing to complain about. Besidesbeing quoted in all the newspapers and praised by such critics as João das Neves andJosé Arrabal, that despised second prize brought A Revolta a place in the TeatroOpinião’s much-prized series of readings, which were open to the public and took placeevery week. Paulo may have been upset about not winning first prize, but he was veryanxious during the days that preceded the reading. He could think of nothing else allweek and was immensely proud when he watched the actress Maria Pompeu reading hisplay before a packed house.Months later, his acquaintance with Teatro Opinião meant that he met–verybriefly–one of the international giants of counterculture, the revolutionary Americandrama group the Living Theatre, which was touring Brazil at the time. When Paulolearned that he had managed to get tickets to see a production by the group, he was soexcited that he felt ‘quite intimidated, as though I had just taken a big decision’. Fearingthat he might be asked to give his opinion on something during the interval or after theplay, he read a little Nietzsche before going to the theatre ‘so as to have something tosay’. In the end, he and Vera were so affected by what they saw that they wangled aninvitation to the house where the group–headed by Julian Beck and Judith Malina–werestaying, and from there went on to visit the shantytown in Vidigal. Judging by the notesin his diary, however, the meeting did not go well: ‘Close contact with the LivingTheatre. We went to the house where Julian Beck and Judith Malina are staying and noone talked to us. A bitter feeling of humiliation. We went with them to the favela. It wasthe first time in my life that I’d been to a favela. It’s a world apart.’The following day, although they had had lunch with the group and been present atrehearsals, the Americans’ attitude towards them remained unchanged. ‘Julian Beck andJudith Malina continue to treat us with icy indifference,’ he wrote. ‘But I don’t blamethem. I know it must have been very difficult to get where they are.’ The next Pauloheard of the group and its leaders was some months later, when he heard that they hadbeen arrested in Ouro Preto, in Minas Gerais, accused of possession and use ofcannabis. The couple had rented a large house in the city and turned it into a permanentdrama workshop for actors from all over Brazil. A few weeks later, the policesurrounded the house and arrested all eighteen members of the group and took themstraight to the Dops prison in Belo Horizonte.In spite of protests from the famous across the world–Jean-Paul Sartre, MichelFoucault, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Jean-Luc Godard and Umberto Eco among others–themilitary government kept the whole group in prison for sixty days, after which theyexpelled all the foreign members, accusing them of ‘drug trafficking and subversion’.As for Paulo, some months after he and Vera had first been introduced to cannabis,the artist Jorge Mourão gave them a tiny block the size of a packet of chewing gum thatlooked as though it were made of very dark, almost black, wax. It was hashish."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Although it comes from the same plant as cannabis, hashish is stronger and was alwaysa drug that was consumed more in Europe and North Africa than in South America,which meant that it was seen as a novelty among Brazilian users. Obsessive as everabout planning and organizing everything he did, Paulo decided to convert a mere ‘puff’into a solemn scientific experiment. From the moment he inhaled the drug for the firsttime he began to record all his sensations on tape, keeping a note of the time as well. Hetyped up the final result and stuck it in his diary:Brief notes on our Experiment with HashishTo Edgar Allan PoeWe began to smoke in my bedroom at ten forty at night. Those present:myself, Vera and Mourão. The hashish is mixed with ordinary tobacco in aratio of approximately one to seven and put into a special silver pipe. This pipemakes the smoke pass through iced water, which allows for perfect filtration.Three drags each are enough. Vera isn’t going to take part in the experiment, asshe’s going to do the recording and take photos. Mourão, who’s an old hand atdrugs, will tell us what we must do.3 minutes–A feeling of lightness and euphoria. Boundless happiness.Strong inner feelings of agitation. I walk backwards and forwards feelingtotally drunk.6 minutes–My eyelids are heavy. A feeling of dizziness and sleepiness. Myhead is starting to take on terrifying proportions, with images slightly distortedinto a circular shape. At this phase of the experiment, certain mental blocks (ofa moral order) surfaced in my mind. Note: the effects may have been affectedby over-excitement.10 minutes–An enormous desire to sleep. My nerves are completelyrelaxed and I lie down on the floor. I start to sweat, more out of anxiety thanheat. No initiative whatsoever: if the house caught fire, I’d rather die than getup from here.20 minutes–I’m conscious, but have lost all sense of where sounds comefrom. It’s a pleasant phase that leads to total lack of anxiety.28 minutes–The sense of the relativity of time is really amazing. This mustbe how Einstein discovered it.30 minutes–Suddenly, I lose consciousness entirely. I try to write, but I failto realize that this is just an attempt, a test. I begin to dance, to dance like amadman; the music is coming from another planet and I exist in an unknowndimension.33 minutes–Time is passing terribly slowly.

One footin front of the other.Not satisfied with smoking hashish and recording its effects, Paulo was brave enough totry something which, in the days when he was under his father’s authority, would haveended in a session of electroshock therapy in the asylum: he made a copy of these notesand his parents almost died of shock when he gave it to them to read. From his point ofview, this was perhaps not simply an act of provocation towards Lygia and Pedro.Although he confessed to his diary that he had ‘discovered another world’ and that‘drugs are the best thing in the world’, Paulo considered himself to be no ordinarycannabis user but, rather, ‘an activist ideologue of the hippie movement’ who nevertired of repeating to his friends the same extravagant claim: ‘Drugs are to me what themachine gun is to communists and guerrillas.’ As well as cannabis and hashish, thecouple had become frequent users of synthetic drugs. Since the time when he had firstbeen admitted to the clinic, he had been prescribed regular doses of Valium.Unconcerned about the damage these drug cocktails might cause to their nervoussystems, the lovers became enthusiastic users of Mandrix, Artane, Dexamil andPervitin. Amphetamines were present in some of these drugs and acted on the centralnervous system, increasing the heartbeat and raising blood pressure, producing apleasant sensation of muscular relaxation, which was followed by feelings of euphoriathat would last up to fourteen hours. When they became tired, they would take somekind of sleeping drug such as Mandrix, and crash out. Drugs used in the control ofepileptic fits or the treatment of Parkinson’s disease guaranteed never-ending ‘trips’that lasted days and nights without interruption.One weekend at Kakiko’s place in Friburgo, 100 kilometres from Rio, Paulo carried"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"out an experiment to find out how long he could remain drugged without stopping evento sleep, and was overjoyed when he managed to complete more than twenty-four hours,not sleeping and completely ‘out of it’. Only drugs seemed to have any importance onthis dangerous path that he was following. ‘Our meals have become somewhatsubjective,’ he wrote in his diary. ‘We don’t know when we last ate and anyway wedon’t seem to miss food at all.’Just one thing seemed to be keeping him connected to the world of the normal, ofthose who did not take drugs: the stubborn desire to be a writer. He was determined tolock himself up in Uncle José’s house in Araruama and just write. ‘To write, to write alot, to write everything’ was his immediate plan. Vera agreed and urged him on, but shesuggested that before he did this, they should relax and take a holiday. In April 1970,the couple decided to go to one of the Meccas of the hippie movement, Machu Picchu,the sacred city of the Incas in the Peruvian Andes, at an altitude of 2,400 metres. Stilltraumatized by his journey to Paraguay, Paulo feared that something evil would happento him if he left Brazil. It was only after much careful planning that the couple finallydeparted. Inspired by the 1969 film Easy Rider, they had no clear destination or fixeddate of return.On 1 May they took a Lloyd Aéro Boliviano aeroplane to La Paz for a trip thatinvolved many novelties, the first of which Paulo experienced as soon as he got out atEl Alto airport, in the Bolivian capital: snow. He was so excited when he saw everythingcovered by such a pure white blanket that he could not resist throwing himself on theground and eating the snow. It was the start of a month of absolute idleness. Vera spentthe day in bed in the hotel, unable to cope with the rarefied air of La Paz at 4,000metres. Paulo went out to get to know the city and, accustomed to the political apathy ofa Brazil under a dictatorship, he was shocked to see workers’ demonstrations on LabourDay. Four months later, Alfredo Ovando Candia, who had just named himself Presidentof the Republic for the third time, was ousted.Taking advantage of the low cost of living in Bolivia, they rented a car, stayed ingood hotels and went to the best restaurants. Every other day, the elegant Vera madetime to go to the hairdresser’s, while Paulo climbed the steep hills of La Paz. It wasthere that they encountered a new type of drug, which was almost non-existent inBrazil: mescalito, also known as peyote, peyotl or mescal–a hallucinogenic tea distilledfrom cut, dried cactus. Amazed by the calmness and tranquillity induced by the drink,they wallowed in endless visual hallucinations and experienced intense moments ofsynaesthesia, a confusion of the senses that gives the user the sense of being able tosmell a colour or hear a taste.They spent five days in La Paz drinking the tea, visiting clubs to listen to localmusic and attending diabladas, places where plays in which the Inca equivalent of theDevil predominated. They then caught a train to Lake Titicaca, the highest navigablelake in the world, where they took a boat across and then the train to Cuzco and Machu"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Picchu, after which they went by plane to Lima.In Lima, they rented a car and headed for Santiago de Chile, passing throughArequipa, Antofagasta and Arica. The plan was to spend more time on this stretch, butthe hotels were so unprepossessing that they decided to carry on. Neither Paulo nor Veraenjoyed the Chilean capital–‘a city like any other’, he wrote–but they did have thechance to see Costa-Gavras’s film Z, which denounced the military dictatorship inGreece and was banned in Brazil. At the end of their three-week trip, still almostconstantly under the influence of mescalito, they found themselves in Mendoza, inArgentina, on the way to Buenos Aires. Paulo was eaten up with jealousy when he sawthe attractive Vera being followed by men, particularly when she began to speak inEnglish, which he still could not understand that well. In La Paz it had been the sight ofsnow that had taken him by surprise; in Buenos Aires it was going on the metro for thefirst time. Accustomed to low prices in the other places they had visited, they decided todine at the Michelangelo, a restaurant known as ‘the cathedral of the tango’, where theywere lucky enough to hear a classic of the genre, the singer Roberto ‘Polaco’Goyeneche. When they were handed a bill for $20–the equivalent of about US$120today–Paulo almost fell off his chair to discover that they were in one of the mostexpensive restaurants in the city.Although his asthma had coped well with the Andean heights, in Buenos Aires, atsea level, it reappeared in force. With a temperature of 39°C and suffering from intensebreathing difficulties, he had to remain in bed for three days and began to recover onlyin Montevideo, on 1 June, the day before they were to leave for Brazil. At his insistence,they would not be making the return journey on a Lloyd Aéro Boliviano flight. Thischange had nothing to do with superstition or with the fact that they would have totravel via La Paz. Paulo had seen the bronze statue of a civilian pilot at La Paz airport inhomage ‘to the heroic pilots of LAB who have died in action’: ‘I’d be mad to travelwith a company that treats the pilots of crashed planes as heroes! What if our pilot hasambitions to become a statue?’ In the end, they flew Air France to Rio de Janeiro, wherethey arrived on 3 June in time to watch the first round of the 1970 World Cup, when theBrazilian team beat Czechoslovakia 4–1.The dream of becoming a writer would not go away. Paulo placed nowhere in theshort story competions he entered. He wrote in his diary: ‘It was with a broken heartthat I heard the news...that I had failed to win yet another literary competition. I didn’teven get an honourable mention.’ However, he did not allow himself to be crushed bythese defeats and continued to note down possible subjects for future literary works,such as ‘flying saucers’, ‘Jesus’, ‘the abominable snowman’, ‘spirits becomingembodied in corpses’ and ‘telepathy’. All the same, the prizes continued to elude him,as he recorded in his notes: ‘Dear São José, my protector. You are witness to the factthat I’ve tried really hard this year. I’ve lost in every competition. Yesterday, when Iheard I’d lost in the competition for children’s plays, Vera said that when my luck"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"finally does arrive, it will do so all in one go. Do you agree?’On his twenty-third birthday, Vera gave him a sophisticated microscope and waspleased to see what a success it was: hours after opening the gift, Paulo was stillhunched over it, carefully examining the glass plates and making notes. Curious toknow what he was doing, she began to read what he was writing: ‘It’s twenty-threeyears today since I was born. I was already this thing that I can see under themicroscope. Excited, moving in the direction of life, infinitesimally small but with allmy hereditary characteristics in place. My two arms, my legs and my brain were alreadyprogrammed. I would reproduce myself from that sperm cell, the cells would multiply.And here I am, aged twenty-three.’ It was only then that she realized that Paulo had puthis own semen under the microscope. The notes continue: ‘There goes a possibleengineer. Another one that ought to have become a doctor is dying. A scientist capableof saving the Earth has also died, and I’m impassively watching all this through mymicroscope. My own sperm are furiously flailing around, desperate to find an egg,desperate to perpetuate themselves.’Vera was good company, but she could be tough too. When she realized that, if hehad anything to do with it, Paulo would never achieve anything beyond the schooldiploma he had got at Guanabara, she almost forced him to prepare for his universityentrance exams. Her vigilance produced surprising results. By the end of the year, hehad managed to be accepted by no fewer than three faculties: law at Cândido Mendes,theatre direction at the Escola Nacional de Teatro and media studies at the PontifíciaUniversidade Católica (PUC) in Rio.This success, needless to say, could not be attributed entirely to Vera: it had asmuch to do with Paulo’s literary appetite. Since he had begun making systematic notesof his reading four years earlier, he had read more than three hundred books, or seventy-five a year–a vast number when one realizes that most Brazilians read, on average, onebook a year. He read a great deal and he read everything. From Cervantes to Kafka,from Jorge Amado to Scott Fitzgerald, from Aeschylus to Aldous Huxley. He readSoviet dissidents such as Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Brazilians who were on policefiles such as the humourist Stanislaw Ponte Preta. He would read, make a shortcommentary on each work and rate them accordingly. The highest accolade, four stars,was the privilege of only a few writers, such as Henry Miller, Borges and Hemingway.And he blithely awarded ‘zero stars’ to books as varied as Norman Mailer’s AmericanDream, Régis Debray’s Revolution in Revolution and two Brazilian classics, Os Sertões[Rebellion in the Backlands] by Euclides da Cunha and História Econômica do Brasil[An Economic History of Brazil] by Caio Prado, Jr.In this mélange of subjects, periods and authors, there was one genre that appearedto arouse Paulo’s interest more than others: books dealing with the occult, witchcraftand satanism. Ever since he had read a short book written by the Spanish sorcerer JoséRamón Molinero, The Secret Alchemy of Mankind, he had devoured everything relating"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"to the invisible world beyond the human senses. When he finished reading The Dawn ofMagic by the Belgian Louis Pauwels and the French-Ukrainian Jacques Bergier, hebegan to feel he was a member of this new tribe. ‘I’m a magician preparing for hisdawn,’ he wrote in his diary. At the end of 1970, he had collected fifty works on thesubject. During this time he had read, commented on and given star ratings to all six ofthe Hermann Hesse books published in Brazil, as well as to Erich von Däniken’s best-sellers The Chariots of the Gods and Return to the Stars, Goethe’s Faust, to which hegave only three stars, and to absurd books such as Black Magic and White Magic by acertain V.S. Foldej, which didn’t even merit a rating.One of the most celebrated authors of this new wave was Carlos Castaneda. Notonly did he write on the occult: his own story was shrouded in mystery. He was said tohave been born in 1925 in Peru (or in 1935 in Brazil, according to other sources) andhad graduated in anthropology at the University of California, in Los Angeles. When hewas preparing his doctoral thesis he decided to write autobiographical accounts of hisexperiences in Mexico on the use of drugs such as peyote, mushrooms and stramonium(known as devil’s weed) in native rituals. The worldwide success of Castaneda, whoeven featured on the cover of Time magazine, attracted hordes of hippies, in search ofthe new promised land, from the four corners of the earth to the Sonora desert on theborder where California and Arizona meet Mexico, where the books were set.For those who, like Paulo, did not believe in coincidences, the fact that it was atprecisely this moment that his mother made him the gift of a trip to the United Statesseemed like a sign. His grandmother Lilisa was going to Washington to visit herdaughter Lúcia, who was married to the diplomat Sérgio Weguelin, and he would gowith her and, if he wanted, extend the trip and go travelling alone or with his cousinSerginho, who was a few years younger. Besides giving him the opportunity to get toknow first-hand the area about which Castaneda had written, the trip was useful inanother way. His relationship with Vera appeared to be coming to an end. ‘Life with heris getting complicated,’ he complained at the beginning of 1971 in his diary. ‘We don’thave sex any more, she’s driving me mad, and I’m driving her mad. I don’t love her anymore. It’s just habit.’ Things had reached such a low ebb that the two had stopped livingtogether. Vera had returned to her apartment in Leblon and he had moved from SantaTeresa back to his grandparents’ house before moving to Copacabana. Besides this, heannounced in his diary that he was ‘half-married’ to a new woman, the young actressChristina Scardini, whom he had met at drama school and with whom he swore he waspassionately in love. This was a lie, but during the month and a half he was away inAmerica, she was the recipient of no fewer than forty-four letters.At the beginning of May, after a celebratory farewell dinner given by his parents,he took a Varig flight with his grandparents to New York, where they were to catch aninternal flight to Washington. When they arrived at Kennedy airport, Paulo and hisgrandmother couldn’t understand why Tuca was in such a hurry to get the eleven"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"o’clock plane to Washington, for which the check-in was just closing. Lilisa and hergrandson argued that there was no reason to rush, because if they missed that plane theycould take the following flight, half an hour later. Out of breath from running, the threeboarded the plane just as the doors were about to be closed. Tuca only calmed downonce they were all sitting with their seatbelts buckled. That night, when they werewatching the news at his uncle’s house, Paulo realized that the hand of destiny hadclearly been behind Tuca’s insistence that they catch the 11.00 flight. The 11.30 flight, atwin-engined Convair belonging to Allegheny (later US Airways), had experiencedmechanical problems and when the pilot tried to make an emergency landing near NewHaven, 70 kilometres from New York, the plane had crashed, killing the crew and allthirty passengers on board.While staying at his diplomat uncle’s house in Bethesda, Maryland, half an hourfrom Washington, instead of writing a travel diary Paulo decided to use his copiouscorrespondence with Christina to record his impressions. He seemed to be astounded byeverything he saw. He could stand for ages, gazing at the automatic vending machinesfor stamps, newspapers and soft drinks, or spend hours on end in department storeswithout buying anything, amazed by the sheer variety of products. In his very first letterhe regretted not having taken with him ‘a sack of change’ from Brazil, since he haddiscovered that all the machines accepted the Brazilian 20 centavo coin as if it were a25 cent piece, even though it was worth only one fifth of the value. ‘I’d have made greatsavings if I’d brought more coins,’ he confessed, ‘because it costs me 25 cents to buy astamp for Brazil from the vending machines and to get in to see the blue movies theyshow in the porn shops here.’Everything was new and everything excited him, from the supermarket shelvesstacked with unnecessary items to the works of art at the National Gallery, where hewept as he actually touched with his own hands the canvas of Death and the Miser byHieronymus Bosch. He knew perfectly well that touching a painting is a cardinal sin inany serious museum, but he placed his fingers not only on Bosch’s 1485 work but onseveral other masterpieces too. He would stand in front of each work for some minutes,look around and, when he was certain he wasn’t being watched by the security guards,commit the heresy of spreading all ten fingers out on the canvas. ‘I touched a VanGogh, a Gauguin, and a Degas, and I felt something growing in me, you know,’ he toldhis girlfriend. ‘I’m really growing here. I’m learning a lot.’Nothing, however, seems to have struck him more, while in Washington, than thevisits he made to the military museum and the FBI museum. The first, with its manyexhibits relating to the participation of the United States in the two world wars,appeared to him to be a place ‘where children are sent to learn to hate the enemies ofthe United States’. Not only children, to judge by his reaction. After visiting every bit ofthe museum and seeing planes, rockets and films about American military power, heleft ‘hating the Russians, wanting to kill, kill, kill, spitting hatred’. On his tour of the"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"FBI museum, with a federal agent as his guide, he saw the Gangster Museum, with theoriginal clothes and weapons used by famous gangsters, such as Dillinger, ‘Baby Face’,‘Machine Gun Kelly’ and others, as well as the actual notes written by kidnappedhostages. In the corner of one room he was surprised to find a blinking light, underwhich was a plaque bearing the following words: ‘Each time this light blinks, a type Acrime (murder, kidnap or rape) is committed in the United States.’ The problem wasthat the light blinked every three seconds. On the gun stand, the agent was proud of thefact that in the FBI, they shoot to kill. That night, on a card peppered with exclamationmarks, he recorded his feelings:These guys don’t miss! They shot with revolvers and machine-guns, and alwaysat the target’s head! They never missed! And there were children, my love,watching all this! There were whole school parties at the FBI gun stand to findout how they defend the country!...The agent told me that to join the FBI youhave to be taller than 1.80m, have a good aim and be prepared for them toexamine the whole of your past life. Nothing else. There’s no intelligence test,only a shooting test. I’m in the most advanced country in the world, in acountry enjoying every comfort and the highest social perfection. So why dosuch things happen here?Concerned with his public image, Paulo usually appended a footnote, asking Christinanot to show the letters to anyone. ‘They’re very private and written with no thought forstyle,’ he explained. ‘You can say what I’ve written, but don’t let anyone else readthem.’ At the end of a marathon week of visits, he bought a train ticket to New York,where he was going to decide on his next move. In a comfortable red-and-blue second-class carriage on an Amtrak train, minutes after leaving the American capital, he felt ashiver run through him when he realized the purpose of the concrete constructionsbeside the railway line: they were fall-out shelters built in case of nuclear war. Thesedark thoughts were interrupted by a tap on his shoulder when the train was about tomake its first stop in Elizabeth, New Jersey.It was the conductor, wearing a blue uniform and with a leather bag round his waist,who said to him: ‘Morning, sir, may I see your ticket?’Surprised, and not understanding what he meant, Paulo responded in Portuguese:‘Desculpe.’The man seemed to be in a hurry and in a bad mood: ‘Don’t you understand? Iasked for your ticket! Without a ticket nobody travels on my train.’It was only at this point that Paulo understood, with deep dismay, that all Vera’sefforts to make him into a model English speaker had been in vain. Without her to turnto, he realized that it was one thing to read books in English, and even then with the"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"help of his lover or of dictionaries. It was quite another to speak it and, most of all, tounderstand what people were saying in the language. The disappointing truth was thatthere he was alone in the United States and he couldn’t say a single, solitary word inEnglish."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12Discovering AmericaPAULO’S FIRST IMPRESSION OF NEW YORK could not have been worse. In marked contrastto the cleanliness and colour he was accustomed to seeing on cinema screens and inbooks, the city that opened up to him through the train windows as soon as he passedthrough the Brooklyn tunnel and entered Manhattan Island appeared to be infested withbeggars and ugly, poorly dressed, threatening-looking people. But this sight did notdishearten him. He wanted to stay only a few days in the city and then set off to find theoriginal objective of his journey: the Grand Canyon in Arizona and the magical desertsof Mexico. He had US$300 and wanted to spend two months ‘wandering from one sideof the United States to the other’. The first thing he should do was to stop travelling bytrain and switch to Greyhound buses. He remembered having seen these buses in films,an elegant greyhound painted on the side. A pass costing US$99 gave you the right totravel for forty-five days to anywhere on the Greyhound network, more than twothousand towns across the United States, Mexico and Canada. Since his plan was tospend two months travelling, this meant that, with the money that remained, he couldonly afford to stay in YMCA hostels, which charged 6 dollars a night, includingbreakfast and dinner.Two days was enough for New York to dispel the disappointment he had felt onarrival. Firstly, because, although the YMCA rooms were small–half the size of hisroom at his grandmother’s house–and they had no bathroom, television or airconditioning, they were single and very clean, with bed linen changed daily. The staffwere polite and while the food was not exactly haute cuisine, it was well cooked andtasty. Were it not for the discomfort of having to share a bathroom with all the otherguests on the corridor, Paulo could happily have stayed there longer. The continuingproblem was the language. Every day, in the dining room, he would annoy everyone elsein the hungry, impatient queue with his inability to communicate to the cook what itwas he wanted to eat. It was a relief to learn that the delicious beans served at theYMCA were called ‘poroto’. Since this was a word he had no difficulty in pronouncing,the problem was solved: he would eat nothing but ‘poroto’ until his English improved.New York’s tolerant, liberal atmosphere also helped to reconcile him to the city.Paulo discovered that sex, cannabis and hashish were all available in the streets,especially in the areas around Washington Square, where groups of hippies spent theirdays playing guitars and enjoying the first rays of spring sunshine. One night, he arrivedat the hostel restaurant only five minutes before the doors were to be closed. Even"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"though almost all the tables were empty, he picked up his tray and sat down opposite aslim girl of about twenty, wearing what seemed to be the official uniform of hippiewomen the world over–an ankle-length Indian dress in multi-coloured cotton. A smileappeared on her freckled face and Paulo, sure that he had enough English to be polite,said: ‘Excuse me?’The girl didn’t understand: ‘What?’Realizing that he was incapable of pronouncing even a banal ‘excuse me’, herelaxed and started to laugh at himself. Feeling more relaxed made communicationeasier, and, later that night, he and the girl, Janet, walked together through the citystreets. However hard he tried to find out what it was she was studying, Paulo could notunderstand what the word ‘belei’ meant. Belei? But what did studying ‘belei’ mean?Janet drew back and jumped up, her arms wide, performed a pirouette, and thencurtseyed deeply. So that was what it was! She was studying ballet!At the end of the evening, on the way back to the hostel, where men and womenslept on different floors, the young couple stopped on the steps of a building in MadisonSquare Garden to say goodbye. Between kisses and hugs, Janet slipped her hand belowPaulo’s waist, over his jeans, and then started back and said, almost spelling out thewords so that he could understand: ‘I’ve been with other boys before, but you...Wow!You’re the first one I’ve known who’s had a square one.’ Laughing, he had to explainthat no, he did not have a square dick. Rather than leaving his documents in thewardrobe in the YMCA, he had put all his money and his return ticket to Brazil in hispassport and put the whole lot in a supposedly safe place–his underpants.It was under the guidance of Janet, with whom he would often have sex in quietcorners of parks and gardens, that he came to know a new world: the New York of the1970s. He joined demonstrations against the war in Vietnam, went to concerts ofbaroque music in Central Park and was thrilled to go down some steps and findPennsylvania station magically lit up. ‘It’s bigger than Central station in Rio,’ he wroteto his girlfriend, ‘only it’s constructed entirely underground.’ He was excited when hewent to Madison Square Garden, ‘where three months ago Cassius Clay was beaten byJoe Frazier’. His passion for the boxer who would later take the name Muhammad Aliwas such that he not only watched all his fights but also compared his tiny physicalmeasurements with those of the American giant. Although he had no specific date toreturn home, time seemed too short to enjoy everything that New York had to offer ayoung man from a poor country under a military dictatorship.When he could, he tried to record in his letters the excitement he was experiencing:There are areas where everything–books, newspapers, posters–is written inChinese, or Spanish or Italian.

I think NY is theprostitutes walking the streets at midday in Central Park, it’s the buildingwhere Rosemary’s Baby was filmed, it’s the place where West Side Story wasfilmed.Before sealing the envelopes he would cover the margins of his letters with sentimentaldeclarations of love (‘adored, loved, wonderful woman’, or ‘I’ll telephone you even ifI’ve got to go without food for a day just to hear your voice for a minute’) and a fewlies, such as ‘Don’t worry, I won’t cheat on you’.At the end of a torrid, two-week affair with New York, Paulo realized that he waslimited by two things: neither his hesitant English nor his savings would be enough forhim to travel alone across the United States for two months. The question of moneycould be resolved with a clever piece of belt-tightening suggested by Janet: if he usedhis Greyhound ticket for night journeys lasting more than six hours, the bus wouldbecome his hotel bedroom. The language problem, though, seemed insoluble. Hisschoolboy vocabulary might be enough to cope with basic needs, such as sleeping andeating, but Paulo knew that the journey would lose its charm if he couldn’t properlyunderstand what other people were saying. Faced with a choice between returning toBrazil and asking for help, he opted for the latter: he made a reverse-charge call to hisaunt’s house in Washington and invited his cousin Sérgio, who spoke English fluently,to go with him. A few days later, the two young men, rucksacks on their backs and usingthe Greyhound buses as a hotel, headed off to Chicago, the first stop on the long haul tothe Grand Canyon, in the heart of Arizona, more than 4,000 kilometres from Manhattanand so far away that the time there was three hours earlier than in New York.The only records of this period are the letters he sent to Christina, and one notes theabsence of any reference to his companion who was, after all, his saviour on thejourney. This is not just a lapse, because, besides overlooking Sérgio’s presence, Paulotold his girlfriend that he was travelling alone. ‘Perhaps I’ll leave my camera withGranny during the journey,’ he wrote, ‘because I’m alone and can’t take photos ofmyself, and it’s better to buy postcards than to waste film on landscapes.’ He wanted tomake this marathon trip sound like a bold adventure.With no money to spare, he recorded all his expenses on a piece of paper with theamounts in dollars and Brazilian cruzeiros: a packet of cigarettes 60 cents, a hamburger80 cents, a subway ticket 30 cents, a cinema ticket 2 dollars. Each time they missed thenight Greyhound bus, his savings would shrink by 7 dollars, the price of a room in oneof the more modest roadside hotels. New York, with its mixture of civilization andbarbarism, had left him ‘shaken up’, and it was hard for him to adjust to the more ruralstates in the Midwest. ‘After NYC I’ve got little to say,’ he complained to Christina in anear unintelligible scrawl written as the bus was moving. ‘I’m only writing because I’m"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"really missing my woman.’ The majority of the cities he visited merited onlysuperficial mention in his correspondence. His impression of Chicago was that it wasthe ‘coldest’ city he had so far encountered. ‘The people are absolutely neurotic, andtotally and uncontrollably aggressive. It’s a city where they take work very seriously.’After spending five days on the road, Paulo’s eyes lit up at the sight through thedusty bus window of a road sign saying ‘Cheyenne–100 miles’. In the state ofWyoming, on the border with Colorado, in the heart of the American West, this was acity he felt he had known since childhood. He had read so many books and magazinesand seen so many Westerns set in Cheyenne that he thought himself capable ofreconstructing from memory the names of the streets, hotels and saloons where thecowboy and Indian adventures had taken place. His astonishment at seeing the road signstemmed from the fact that he hadn’t realized the city actually existed. In his mind,Cheyenne was a fantasy appropriated by the authors of books, films and cartoons instories of the Wild West that he had read and seen during his childhood andadolescence.He was disappointed to discover that while there were still cowboys in the city, inboots, Stetsons and belts with bull’s buckles, and revolvers in holsters, they nowtravelled in convertible Cadillacs. The only traces of the Cheyenne he had seen in JohnFord’s Cheyenne Autumn were the carriages used by the local Amish community, whichforbids the use of such modern inventions as lifts, telephones and cars. But his greatestdisappointment was when he discovered that Pioneer Street, the favourite place forcowboys to hold duels in the evening in the mythical Cheyenne, had been transformedinto a busy four-lane highway lined with shops selling electronic gadgets.The obvious route to the Grand Canyon was to travel some 1,000 kilometressouthwest, then cross Colorado and part of New Mexico into Arizona. However, becausethey both wanted to go to Yellowstone Park and make the most of their Greyhoundticket, they travelled in the opposite direction, northwards. When they realized that theclosest stopping-off place to the park was Idaho Falls, 300 kilometres fromYellowstone, Paulo decided to take two risks. First, he spent US$30 on hiring a car.Second, since he had not taken his driving test he lied to the car-hire firm and presentedhis membership card of the Actors’ Union in Rio as a Brazilian driving licence.Although he was aware that he risked being arrested if stopped by a trafficpoliceman, he drove for the whole day past the glaciers in the park and the geysersspewing out hot water and sulphur on to the snow, and saw bears and deer crossing theroad. In the evening, they went to return the car and decided to catch a Greyhound buswhere they could shelter from the cold. Although it was the middle of summer and thetwo had experienced temperatures of up to 38°C, two hours from the Canadian border,the cold was so unbearable that the heating in the car wasn’t enough to keep them warm.As neither had suitable clothes for such low temperatures, when they arrived at the busstation in Boise, the capital of Idaho, they rushed to the Greyhound ticket office to ask"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"what time the next night bus left. Going where? Anywhere that wasn’t so cold. If theonly destination with available seats at that time of night was San Francisco, then thatwas where they would go.In the middle of the night, as the bus was crossing the Nevada desert, he wrote aletter to Christina boasting of how he had tricked the man at the car-hire firm with hisfalse licence, but regretting the fact that the extra expense of hiring the car had ‘messedup my budget’. He also said that he had discovered the reason for the strong smell ofwhisky pervading the Greyhound bus: ‘Everyone here has a small bottle in his pocket.They drink a lot in the United States.’ The letter is interrupted halfway through andstarts again some hours later:I was going to go straight to San Francisco, but I discovered that gambling inNevada is legal, so I spent the night here. I wanted to play and see how otherpeople play. I didn’t make any friends at the casino; they were all too busygambling. I ended up losing 5 dollars in a one-armed bandit–you know, thosebetting machines where you pull a handle. There was a cowboy sitting next tome wearing boots, hat and neckerchief, just like in the films. In fact the wholebus is full of cowboys. I’m in the Far West on the way to San Francisco, whereI’m due to arrive at eleven at night. In seven hours’ time, I’ll have crossed theAmerican continent, which not many other people have.When they reached San Francisco, exhausted after travelling for twenty-two days, thecousins signed in at a YMCA hostel and spent the day sleeping, in an attempt to catchup on more than a hundred hours spent sitting in cramped buses.The cradle of the hippie movement, San Francisco had as great an impact on Pauloas New York. ‘This city is much freer than NYC. I went to a really smart cabaret andsaw naked women making love with men on the stage in front of rich Americans withtheir wives,’ he told her, excited but regretting the fact that he’d been unable to seemore. ‘I went in quickly and saw just a bit of the show, but as I didn’t have enoughmoney to buy a seat, I got thrown out.’ He was astonished to see adolescents buying andconsuming LSD pills quite openly; he bought some hashish in the hippie district,smoked it on the street and no one stopped him. He also took part in demonstrationsagainst the war in Vietnam and saw a pacifist march by Buddhist monks being brokenup by a gang of young blacks with truncheons. ‘You breathe an air of complete madnessin the streets of this city,’ he said in a letter to Christina.After five ‘mind-blowing’ days, the cousins caught another bus in the direction ofthe Grand Canyon. They got off halfway there, in Los Angeles, but as it was 4 July,Independence Day, the city was dead, and they stayed only a few hours. ‘Nothing wasopen, and it was almost impossible to find somewhere to have a coffee,’ he complained."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"‘The famous Hollywood Boulevard was a complete desert, with no one on the streets,but we did see how luxurious everything here is, even the most ordinary bar.’ And sincethe cost of living in Los Angeles was incompatible with the backpackers’ funds, theydidn’t stay the night. They took another bus and, twenty-four hours after leaving SanFrancisco, reached Flagstaff, the entrance to the Grand Canyon.The extortionate prices of the hotels and restaurants were almost as impressive asthe beauty of the canyon. Since there were no YMCA hostels in the area, they bought anylon tent, which meant a 19-dollar hole in their tiny stash of savings, and spent thefirst night in a hippie camp, where at least free hashish was guaranteed. As soon as thesun began to rise, they took down their tent, filled their rucksacks with bottles of waterand tinned food, and left on foot for the Grand Canyon. They walked all day beneath theblazing sun and when they decided to stop, exhausted and hungry, they discovered thatthey were at the widest point of the Canyon, which measures 20 kilometres from side toside. It is also the deepest; between them and the river was a drop of 1,800 metres. Theypitched their tent, lit a small bonfire to heat up their tins of soup and fell asleep,exhausted, not waking until dawn the next day.When Sérgio suggested they go down to the river, Paulo was terrified. As there wasabsolutely no one around, apart from them, and they were on a path little used bytourists, he was worried that should they get into difficulties, there would be no one tocome to their aid. However, Sérgio was determined: if Paulo didn’t want to, he wouldgo alone. He put all his stuff in his rucksack and began the descent, oblivious to hiscousin’s protests: ‘Serginho, the problem isn’t going down, but coming back! It’s goingto get really hot and we’ve got to climb the equivalent of the stairs in a 500-storeybuilding! In the blazing sun!’Impervious, his cousin didn’t even turn round. There was nothing for Paulo to dobut pick up his rucksack and follow him down. The beauty of the area dispelled some ofhis fears. The Grand Canyon looked like a 450-kilometre gash in the desert of red sand,at the bottom of which was what appeared to be a tiny trickle of water. This was, in fact,the torrential Colorado River, which rises in the Rocky Mountains in the state ofColorado and flows more than 2,300 kilometres until it runs into the Sea of Cortez inMexico, crossing six more American states (Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, NewMexico and Wyoming). To be down there was indescribable.After walking for some five hours, Paulo stopped and suggested to his cousin thatthey end their adventure there and begin the climb back up, saying: ‘We didn’t eat muchlast night, we haven’t had a proper breakfast and up to now we haven’t had any lunch.Take a look and see how far we’ve got to climb.’His cousin remained determined. ‘You can wait for me here, because I’m goingdown to the river bank.’He continued walking. Paulo found some shade where he could sit, smoked acigarette and enjoyed the splendour of the landscape as he sat in total silence. When he"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"looked at his watch, he realized it was midday. He walked on a few metres, trying to seeSérgio, but there was no sign of him. Indeed, as far as the eye could see, there was noone, no tourist, no Indians, not a soul for kilometres and kilometres. He realized that ifhe were to go down a little farther, he would come to a rocky ledge from where hewould have a wider view of the area. However, even from there, he couldn’t see hiscousin. He began to shout out his name, waiting a few seconds after each shout, beforeshouting again. His voice echoed between the walls of red stone, but there was neithersign nor sound of his cousin. He was beginning to think that they had taken the wrongpath. From fear to panic was but a step. Feeling entirely defenceless and alone, hebecame terrified. ‘I’m going to die here,’ he kept saying: ‘I’m going to die. I can’t takeany more. I’m not going to get out of here. I’m going to die here, in this wonderfulplace.’He was aware that, in midsummer, the temperatures around the Grand Canyoncould be over 50°C. His water had run out and it was unlikely that there would be a tapin the middle of that desert. Added to which, he had no idea where he was, since therewere so many intersecting paths. He started to shout for help, but no one appeared, andhe heard nothing but the echo of his own voice. It was past four in the afternoon.Desperate to find his cousin, he began to run, stumbling, in the direction of the river,knowing that every step he took meant another he would have to climb up on his return.The sun was burning his face when he finally reached a sign of civilization. Fixedto a rock was a metal plate with a red button and sign saying: ‘If you are lost, press thered button and you will be rescued by helicopters or mules. You will be fined US$500.’He had only 80 dollars left and his cousin must have about the same in his pocket, butthe discovery of the sign made him certain of two things: they were not the first to be sofoolish as to take that route; and the risk of dying began to fade, even though it mightmean a few days in jail until their parents could send the money for the fine. However,first of all, Paulo had to find Sérgio. He went another 200 metres farther down, nevertaking his eyes off the red button, which was his one visible reference mark, and after abend in the path, he came across a natural belvedere where there was a metal telescopewith a coin slot. He inserted 25 cents, the lens opened and he began to scan the riverbanks, looking for his travel companion. There he was, in the shadow of a rock andapparently as exhausted as Paulo. He was sound asleep.Rejecting the idea of summoning a helicopter, they climbed up to the top again, andit was midnight by the time they got there. They were exhausted, their skin was puffywith sunburn, but they were alive. After the long day, the idea of spending another nightin the hippie camp was so appalling that Paulo made a suggestion: ‘I think we deservetwo things tonight: dinner in a restaurant and a night in a hotel.’They found a comfortable, cheap motel, left their rucksacks in their room and wentinto the first restaurant they came to, where each ordered a T-bone steak so big it barelyfitted on the plate. It cost 10 dollars–the amount they usually spent each day. They"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"barely had the strength to pick up knife and fork. They were both starving, though, andate as quickly as they could. Five minutes later, however, they were in the toilet,throwing up. They returned to the motel and collapsed on to their beds for the last nightthey would spend together on their journey: the following day Sérgio would bereturning home to Washington and Paulo was to go on to Mexico.The original reason he had accepted his mother’s gift of a plane ticket had been thatit would give him the chance to make a pilgrimage to the mysterious deserts that hadinspired Carlos Castaneda, but he had been so thrilled by the novelty of the country as awhole that he had almost forgotten this. Now, with his entire body aching after hisadventure in the Grand Canyon, and with money fast running out, he felt a greattemptation to return to Brazil. His Greyhound pass was still valid for a few more days,though, and so he carried on as planned. Grown accustomed to the wealth of America,he was appalled by the poverty he found in Mexico, which was much like Brazil. Hetried all the mushroom syrups and hallucinogenic cactus teas that he could, and thencaught the bus back to New York, where he spent three more days, after which he flewhome to Brazil."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13GisaA WEEK AFTER RETURNING TO BRAZIL, having recovered from his trip, Paulo had still notdecided what to do with his life. One thing was certain: he was not going back to the lawfaculty, so he left the course in the middle of the academic year. He continued to attendclasses in theatre direction at the Guanabara State Faculty of Philosophy–which wouldlater become the University of Rio de Janeiro–and he did everything he could to get hisarticles published in Rio newspapers. He wrote an article about the liberal attitudetowards drugs in the United States and sent it to the most popular humorous weekly ofthe period, Pasquim, which went on to become an influential opponent of thedictatorship. He promised St Joseph that he would light fifteen candles to him if the textwas published and, every Wednesday, he was the first to arrive at the newspaper standon the corner near his home. He would avidly leaf through the magazine only to returnit to the pile, disheartened. It was not until three weeks later that he realized the articlehad been rejected. Although this rejection tormented him for days, it was not enough toput paid to his dream of becoming a writer. When he realized that Pasquim’s silencewas a resounding ‘No’, he made a strange note in his diary: ‘I’ve been thinking aboutthe problem of fame and have concluded that my good fortune hasn’t yet turned up.When it does, it’s going to be quite something.’The problem was that while he waited for it to turn up, he needed to earn a living.He still enjoyed working in the theatre, but the returns weren’t usually enough even tocover the costs of putting on the production. This led him to accept an invitation toteach on a private course preparing students for the entrance exam for theatre coursesgiven by the Federation of Isolated State Schools in the State of Guanabara. It wouldn’tcontribute anything to his future plans, but, on the other hand, it wouldn’t take up muchtime and it guaranteed him a monthly salary of 1,600 cruzeiros, some US$350.On 13 August 1971, a little more than a month after his return from the UnitedStates, Paulo received a phone call from Washington. His grandfather, Arthur Araripeor Tuca, had just died. He had suffered severe cranial trauma when he fell down thestairs at his daughter’s house in Bethesda, where he was staying, and had died instantly.Appalled by the news, Paulo sat in silence for a few minutes, trying to collect histhoughts. One of the last images he had of Tuca, smiling and sporting a beret as theyarrived at the airport in Washington, seemed so fresh that he could not accept that theold man had died. Paulo felt that if he went out on to the verandah he would find Tucadozing there, mouth open, over a copy of the Reader’s Digest. Or, as he loved to do,"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"provoking his hippie grandson with his reactionary ideas, saying for instance that Peléwas ‘an ignorant black man’ and that Roberto Carlos was ‘an hysterical screamer’. Thenhe would defend right-wing dictators, starting with Salazar in Portugal and Franco inSpain (on these occasions, Paulo’s father would join in and insist that ‘any idiot’ couldpaint like Picasso or play the guitar like Jimi Hendrix). Instead of getting annoyed,Paulo would roar with laughter at his obstinate grandfather’s over-the-top remarks,because, for all his conservatism, and perhaps because he himself had been a bit of abohemian during his youth, he was the only member of the family who respected andunderstood the strange friends Paulo went around with. Having known him for so manyyears, and having built a closer relationship with him during the time he spent in hisgrandparents’ small house, Paulo had come to consider Tuca to be almost a secondfather to him. A generous, tolerant father, the very opposite of his real father, the harshand irascible Pedro. For these reasons, his grandfather’s unexpected death was all themore painful, and the wound opened up by that loss would take time to heal.Paulo continued to teach and to go to his theatre course, with which he wasbeginning to find fault. ‘In the first year, the student learns to be a bit of a chiseller andto use personal charm to achieve whatever he or she wants,’ he wrote in his diary. ‘Inthe second year, the student loses any sense of organization he had before and in thethird, he becomes a queer.’ His proverbial paranoia reached unbearable levels when helearned that the detective Nelson Duarte, who was accused of belonging to the DeathSquad, was going around the Escola Nacional de Teatro looking for ‘cannabis users andcommunists’. On one such visit, the policeman was confronted by a brave woman, theteacher and speech and hearing therapist Glória Beutenmüller, who wagged her finger athim and said: ‘My students can wear their hair as long as they like–and if you arrest oneof them, they’ll have to be dragged out of here.’Protected by the secrecy of his diary, Paulo made a solitary protest against thesearbitrary arrests:Nelson Duarte again issued a threat against students and teachers with longhair, and the school issued a decree, banning long hair. I didn’t go to the classtoday because I haven’t decided whether I’m going to cut mine or not. It’saffected me deeply. Cutting my hair, not wearing necklaces, not dressing like ahippie...It’s unbelievable. With this diary I’m writing a real secret archive ofmy age. One day, I’ll publish the whole thing. Or else I’ll put it all in aradiation-proof box with a code that’s easy to work out, so that one daysomeone will read what I’ve written. Thinking about it, I’m a bit worried abouteven keeping this notebook.In fact, he had already made plenty of notes showing that he didn’t share the ideas of"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"many of his left-wing friends who opposed the dictatorship. His diary was pepperedwith statements such as: ‘There’s no point getting rid of this and replacing it withcommunism, which would just be the same shit’ and ‘Taking up arms never solvedanything’. But the repression of any armed conflict was at its height and meresympathizers as well as their friends were being rounded up. Censorship meant that thepress could not publish anything about the government’s use of violence against itsopponents, but news of this nevertheless reached Paulo’s ears, and the shadow cast bythe security forces seemed to get closer by the day. One of his friends was imprisonedby the political police merely because he had renewed his passport in order to go toChile during the period of Salvador Allende’s rule. A year earlier, Paulo had learnedthat a former girlfriend of his, Nancy Unger, had been shot and apprehended inCopacabana while resisting arrest. He found out that Nancy, along with sixty-nine otherpolitical prisoners, had been exiled from Brazil, in exchange for the Swiss ambassadorEnrico Giovanni Bucher, who had been kidnapped by command of the PopularRevolutionary Front. In the end, the repression became too much even for those whoweren’t part of the armed resistance. Persecuted by the censors, the composer ChicoBuarque went into self-imposed exile in Italy. Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso movedto London after having their heads shaved in an army barracks in Rio. Gradually, Paulowas starting to hate the military, but nothing would make him overcome his fear andopen his mouth, and say in public what he felt. Appalled that he could do nothingagainst a regime that was torturing and killing people, he fell into depression.In September 1971, the army surrounded and killed Captain Carlos Lamarca in theinterior of Bahia. When Paulo read excerpts from the dead guerrilla’s diary that werepublished by the press, he wrote a long and bitter outburst that gives a faithful picture ofhis inner conflicts. Once again, he confessed that he avoided talking about the police inhis diary for one reason only: fear. But how could he continue not protesting againstwhat was going on around him? It was when he was alone, locked in his room that hegave expression to his pain:I’m living in a terrible climate, TERRIBLE! I can’t take any more talk aboutimprisonment and torture. There is no freedom in Brazil. The area in which Iwork is subject to vile and stupid censorship.I read Lamarca’s diary. I admired him only because he fought for his ideas,nothing more. Today, though, when I see the demeaning comments in the press,I felt like shouting, like screaming. I was really angry. And I discovered in hisdiary a great love for someone, a poetic love that was full of life, and thenewspaper called it ‘the terrorist’s dependence on his lover’. I discovered aman who was full of self-doubt and hyper-honest with himself, even though hefought for an idea that I consider wrong.The government is torturing people and I’m frightened of torture, I’m"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"frightened of pain. My heart is beating far too fast now, simply because thesewords could compromise me. But I have to write. The whole thing is fucked.Everyone I know has either been imprisoned or beaten up.

Now that I’ve written theselines, I know that I’m going to live in fear, but I couldn’t continue to keepquiet, I needed to let it out. I’m going to type because it’s faster. It needs to befast.

Thedie is cast.Sometimes he would spend all day locked in his room at the back of his grandmother’shouse, smoking cannabis and trying to make a start on that dreamed-of book, or at leasta play, or an essay. He had notebooks full of ideas for books, plays and essays, butsomething was missing–inclination? inspiration?–and when evening came, he stillhadn’t written a line. Otherwise, he taught for three hours a day and then went to theuniversity. He would go in, talk to various people and, when he got fed up with doingthat, end up alone in a bar near by, drinking coffee, chain-smoking and filling pages ofnotebooks with ideas.It was on one such evening that a girl appeared, wearing a miniskirt and high boots.She had very long, thick dark hair. She sat down beside Paulo at the bar, ordered acoffee and struck up a conversation with him. She had just qualified as an architect andher name was Adalgisa Eliana Rios de Magalhães, or Gisa, from Alfenas in MinasGerais; she was two years older than Paulo. She had left Minas for Rio in order to studyat the Federal University and was now working for the Banco Nacional da Habitação,although what she liked best was drawing comic strips. She was as slender as a catwalkmodel, and had an unusual face in which her dark melancholy eyes contrasted with asensual mouth. They talked for some time, exchanged telephone numbers and parted.Once again, Paulo dismissed any possibility of a relationship developing, writing:‘She’s ugly and has no sex appeal.’Unlike Paulo–and this was something he never knew–Gisa had been an active"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"militant in opposition to the military regime. She had never taken part in armed actionor anything that might involve risking her life–and this, in the jargon of repression,meant that she was a ‘subversive’, rather than a ‘terrorist’–but following her first yearin architecture, she had been a member of several clandestine left-wing cells that hadinfiltrated the student movement. It was through the students’ union at the universitythat she joined the Brazilian Communist Party, or PCB, where she handed outpamphlets at student assemblies with copies of Voz Operária [The Worker’s Voice]. Sheleft the party and joined the Dissidência da Guanabara, which changed its name in 1969to Movimento Revolucionário 8 de Outubro, or MR-8, and was one of the groupsresponsible for the kidnapping of the United States ambassador Charles Elbrick.Although she herself was never anything more than a low-ranking militant, Gisa wasnevertheless an activist, and, when she met Paulo, she was having an affair with a youngarchitect from Pernambuco, Marcos Paraguassu de Arruda Câmara. He was the son ofDiógenes de Arruda Câmara, a member of the elite in the Partido Comunista do Brasil,who had been in prison in Rio since 1968, and was himself a militant.In spite of Paulo’s scornful remark after their first meeting, over the next few days,the two met up again every night in the small bar next to the theatre school. A weeklater, he walked her back to the apartment where she lived with her brother, JoséReinaldo, at Flamengo beach. She invited him up, and they listened to music andsmoked cannabis until late. When her brother arrived home at two in the morning, hefound them lying naked on the sitting-room carpet. Less than a month later, Gisa brokeup with Marcos Paraguassu: she and Paulo had decided to live together. Paulo moved inthree weeks later, once she had managed to get rid of her brother, and immediatelyproposed that they get married in a month and a half, on Christmas Eve. Gisa accepted,despite feeling slightly uncomfortable about the speed with which he had moved intoher home and his habit of walking around the apartment naked.Hoping perhaps that marriage would help her son to settle down, Paulo’s motherreacted as warmly as she had with his previous girlfriends. Then, on 22 November, threemonths after they had met, Paulo recorded in his diary: ‘Gisa is pregnant. It looks asthough we’re going to have a son.’ The fact that the baby would be a boy born under thesign of Leo appears to have made him still more excited at the thought of fatherhood.‘My powers will be re-born with this son,’ he wrote delightedly. ‘In the next eightmonths I’ll redouble my energy and climb higher and higher.’The dream lasted less than a week. After his initial excitement, Paulo began to feela sense of horror whenever he thought of it, which was all the time. When realitydawned, and he saw that it would be absolute madness to have a child when he had nopermanent employment and no means of supporting a family, the first person to be toldof his decision was not Gisa but his mother. To Paulo’s surprise, Lygia turned out to benot quite the committed Catholic when he told her that he was going to suggest to hisgirlfriend that she have an abortion. She agreed that having the child was not a good"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"idea. Gisa resisted at first, before agreeing that she, too, was convinced that it would beirresponsible to have the baby. With the help of friends they found a clinic thatspecialized in clandestine abortions–abortion being a crime–and arranged the operationfor 9 December 1971.Neither managed to sleep the night before. In the morning, they got up in silence,had a bath and went in search of a taxi. They arrived at the clinic at seven on the dot, thetime of the appointment. It was a surprise for them both when they saw that there wereabout thirty women there, the majority very young, and many with their husbands orboyfriends–all looking miserable. On arrival, each woman gave her name to the nurse,left a small pile of notes on the table–cheques were not accepted–and waited to becalled. Although there were plenty of chairs, the majority preferred to stand. Fiveminutes later, Gisa was taken by another nurse to a staircase going up to the secondfloor. She left with her head bowed, without saying goodbye. In a matter of minutes, allthe women had been called, with only a few men remaining in the waiting room.Paulo sat on one of the chairs, took a notebook out of his bag and began to write–ina very small hand so that his partners in misfortune would not be able to read what hewas writing. Whether knowingly or not, each tried to conceal his concern with somegesture or other. Paulo was constantly blinking; the man on his right would empty halfthe tobacco from his cigarette into the ashtray before lighting up; another kept flippingthrough a magazine, meanwhile staring into space. Despite his tic, Paulo did not appearto be nervous. He was, it was true, feeling an unpleasant sense of physical smallness, asthough he had suddenly become a shrunken dwarf. Background music was coming fromtwo loudspeakers, and although no one was really listening to it, they all kept time bytapping their feet or rattling their key rings. As he watched these movements, Paulonoted in his diary: ‘They are all trying to keep their bodies as busy as possible and inthe most varied ways, because their subconscious is clearly telling them: “Don’t thinkabout what’s going on in there”.’ They all kept looking at the clock, and each timefootsteps were heard, heads would turn toward the staircase. Occasionally, one wouldcomplain about how slowly time seemed to be passing. A small group tried to put asidetheir thoughts by talking quietly about football. Paulo merely observed and wrote:A young man next to me is complaining about the delay and says that he’sgoing to be late collecting his car from the garage. But I know he’s not reallylike that. He’s not thinking about his car, but he wants me to believe that sothat he can play the part of the strong man. I smile and gaze into his neurones:there’s his wife with her legs open, the doctor is inserting forceps, cutting,scraping and filling everything up with cotton wool once it’s over. He knowsthat I know, turns the other way and is still, without looking at anything,breathing only deeply enough to stay alive."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"At 8.30 in the morning, half the women had left and there was no sign of Gisa. Paulowent to the bar around the corner, had a coffee, smoked a cigarette and went back to thewaiting room and his notebook, impatient and concerned that perhaps things were notgoing well for his girlfriend. An hour later, there was still no news. At 9.30 he put hishand in his pocket, hurriedly took out his fountain pen and wrote: ‘I felt that it was now.My son returned to the eternity he had never left.’Suddenly, no one knew from where, or why, they heard a sound that no one hadreally expected to hear in such a place: a loud, healthy baby’s cry, followedimmediately by a shout of surprise from a young lad in the waiting room: ‘It’s alive!’For a moment, the men appeared to have been freed from the pain, misery and fearthat united them in that gloomy room and they broke into a wild, collective burst oflaughter. Just as the laughter stopped, Paulo heard footsteps: it was Gisa, returning fromthe operation, almost three hours after their arrival. Paler than he had ever seen her andwith dark rings around her eyes, she looked very groggy and was still suffering from theeffects of the anaesthetic. In the taxi on the way home, Paulo asked the driver to goslowly, ‘because my girlfriend has cut her foot and it’s hurting a lot’.Gisa slept the whole afternoon and when she woke she couldn’t stop crying.Sobbing, she told him that just as she was about to be anaesthetized, she had wanted torun out: ‘The doctor put a thin tube inside me and took out a baby that was going to beborn perfect. But now our son is rotting somewhere, Paulo...’Neither could sleep. It was late at night when she went slowly over to the deskwhere he was sitting writing and said: ‘I hate to ask you this, but I’ve got to change thedressing and I think I’ll manage to do it alone. But if it’s very painful, can you comeinto the bathroom with me to help?’He smiled and replied with a supportive ‘Of course’, but once the bathroom doorwas shut, Paulo begged St Joseph a thousand times to save him from that unpleasanttask. ‘Forgive me my cowardice, St Joseph,’ he murmured, looking up, ‘but changingthat dressing would be too much for me. Too much! Too much!’ To his relief, minuteslater, she released him from that obligation and lay down on the bed again. Sinceleaving the abortion clinic, Gisa had only stopped crying when she fell asleep.On the Saturday, Paulo took advantage of the fact that she seemed a little better andwent off to do his teaching. When he got back in the evening, he found her standing atthe bus stop in front of their building. The two returned home and only after muchquestioning from him did she confess what she had been doing in the street: ‘I left thehouse to die.’Paulo’s reaction was astonishing. He immediately said: ‘I’m really sorry Iinterrupted such an important process. If you’ve decided to die, then go ahead and killyourself.’Her courage had failed her, though.On the third night without sleep, Gisa only opened her mouth to cry, while he could"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"not stop talking. He explained carefully that she had no way out: after being called toEarth, the Angel of Death would only go back if he could take a soul with him. He saidthat there was no point in turning back, because the Angel would follow her for ever,and even if she didn’t want to die now, he could kill her later, for example by letting herbe run over. He recalled how he had faced the Angel when he was an adolescent and hadcut the throat of a goat so that he would not have to hand over his own life. The way outwas to stand up to the Angel: ‘You need to challenge him. Do what you decided to do:try to kill yourself but hope that you’ll escape with your life.’When Gisa closed her eyes, exhausted, he went back to his diary, where hepondered the mad course of action he was proposing to his girlfriend:I know that Gisa isn’t going to die, but she doesn’t know it and she can’t livewith that doubt. We have to give a reply to the Angel in some way or other.Some days ago, a friend of ours, Lola, slashed her whole body with a razorblade, but she was saved at the last moment. Lots of people have beenattempting suicide recently. But few succeeded and that’s good, because theyescaped with their lives and managed to kill the person inside them whom theydidn’t like.This macabre theory was not just the fruit of Paulo’s sick imagination but had beenscientifically proven by a psychiatrist whom he frequently visited, and whom heidentified in his diary merely as ‘Dr Sombra’, or ‘Dr Shadow’. The theory was that oneshould reinforce the patient’s traumas. The doctor had told him quite categorically thatno one is cured by conventional methods: ‘If you’re lost and think that the world ismuch stronger than you are,’ he would say to his patients, ‘then all that’s left for you issuicide.’ According to Paulo, this was precisely where the brilliance of his thesis lay:‘The subject leaves the consulting room completely devastated. It’s only then that herealizes that he has nothing more to lose and he begins to do things that he would neverhave had the courage to do in other circumstances. All in all, Dr Sombra’s method isreally the only thing in terms of the subconscious that I have any real confidence in. It’scure by despair.’When they woke the following day–a brilliant, sunny summer Sunday–Paulo didnot need to try to convince Gisa any further. He realized this when she put on aswimsuit, took a bottle of barbiturates from the bathroom cupboard–he thought it wasOrap, or pimozide, which he had been taking since his first admission to the clinic–andemptied the contents into her mouth, swallowing it all down with a glass of water. Theywent out together into the street, she stumbling as she walked, and proceeded down tothe beach. Paulo stayed on the pavement while Gisa waded into the water, where shebegan swimming out to sea. Although he knew that with that amount of medication in"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"her she would never have the strength to swim back, he waited, watching until she wasjust a black dot among the glittering waves, a black dot that was moving farther andfarther away. ‘I was scared, I wanted to give in, to call her, to tell her not to do it,’ hewrote later, ‘but I knew that Gisa wasn’t going to die.’Two men doing yoga on the beach went up to him, concerned that the girl wasnearly out of sight, and said: ‘We should call the lifeguard. The water’s very cold and ifshe gets cramp she’ll never get back.’Paulo calmed them with a smile and a lie: ‘No need, she’s a professional swimmer.’Half an hour later, when a group of people had begun to collect on the pavement,foreseeing a tragedy, Gisa began to swim back. When she reached the beach, pale andghostly looking, she threw up, which probably saved her life, because she vomited upall the tablets. The muscles in her face and arms were stiff from the cold water and fromthe overdose. Paulo held her as they went to the house and then wrote the results of that‘cure by despair’ in his diary:I’m thinking: Who’s the Angel going to content himself with this time, nowthat Gisa is in my arms? She cried and was very tired, and of course she didstill have eight tablets inside her. We came home, and she fell asleep on thecarpet, but woke up looking quite different, with a new light in her eyes. For awhile, we didn’t go out for fear of contagion. The suicide epidemic wasspreading like anything.If anyone had looked through his diaries during the months prior to Gisa’s attemptedsuicide, they would not have been surprised by Paulo’s bizarre behaviour. Since readingMolinero’s book, The Secret Alchemy of Mankind, he had become deeply immersed inthe occult and in witchcraft. It was no longer just a matter of consulting gypsies, witchdoctors and tarot readers. At one point, he had concluded that ‘The occult is my onlyhope, the only visible escape’. As if he had put aside his dream of becoming a writer, henow concentrated all his energies on trying to ‘penetrate deep into Magic, the lastrecourse and last exit for my despair’. He avidly devoured everything relating tosorcerers, witches and occult powers. On the bookshelves in the apartment he sharedwith Gisa, works by Borges and Henry Miller had given way to things such as The Lordof Prophecy, The Book of the Last Judgement, Levitation and The Secret Power of theMind. He would frequently visit Ibiapas, 100 kilometres from Rio, where he would takepurifying baths of black mud administered by a man known as ‘Pajé Katunda’.It was on one such trip that Paulo first attributed to himself the ability to interferewith the elements. ‘I asked for a storm,’ he wrote, ‘and the most incredible stormimmediately blew up.’ However, his supernatural powers did not always work. ‘I triedto make the wind blow, without success,’ he wrote a little later, ‘and I ended up going"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"home frustrated.’ Another trick that failed was his attempt to destroy something merelyby the power of thought: ‘Yesterday Gisa and I tried to break an ashtray by the power ofthought, but it didn’t work. And then, would you believe it, straight afterwards, whilewe were having lunch here, the maid came to say that she had broken the ashtray. It wasbizarre.’Sects had also become an obsession with Paulo. It might be Children of God orHare Krishnas, followers of the Devil’s Bible or even the faithful of the Church ofSatan, whom he had met on his trip to the United States. All it took was a whiff of thesupernatural–or of sulphur, depending on the case. Not to mention the myriad groups ofworshippers of creatures from outer space or UFO freaks. He became so absorbed in theesoteric world that he eventually received an invitation to write in a publication devotedto the subject, the magazine A Pomba. Published by PosterGraph, a small publishinghouse dedicated to underground culture and printing political posters, this contained amiscellany of articles and interviews on subjects of interest to hippie groups: drugs,rock, hallucinations and paranormal experiences. Printed in black and white, every issuecarried a photographic essay involving some naked woman or other, just like men’smagazines, the difference being that the models for A Pomba appeared to be womenrecruited from among the employees in the building where the magazine was produced.Like dozens of other, similar publications, A Pomba had no influence, although it musthave had a reasonable readership, since it managed to survive for seven months. Forhalf the salary he received at the school, Paulo accepted the position of jack-of-all-trades on the magazine: he would choose the subjects, carry out the interviews, writearticles. The visual aspect–design, illustrations and photographs–was Gisa’s job. Itappears to have been a good idea, because after only two issues under Paulo’seditorship, the owner of PosterGraph, Eduardo Prado, agreed to his proposal to launch asecond publication, entitled 2001. With two publications to take care of, his salarydoubled, and he had to give up teaching.While he was doing research for an article on the Apocalypse, it was suggested toPaulo that he should go and see someone who called himself ‘the heir of the Beast inBrazil’, Marcelo Ramos Motta. He was surprised to find that the person he was tointerview lived in a simple, austere apartment with good furniture and bookcasescrammed with books. There was just one eccentric detail: all the books were coveredwith the same grey paper, without any indication as to the content apart from a smallhandwritten number at the foot of the spine. The other surprise was Motta’s appearance.He wasn’t wearing a black cloak and brandishing a trident, as Paulo had expected, butinstead had on a smart navy-blue suit, white shirt, silk tie and black patent-leathershoes. He was sixteen years older than Paulo, tall and thin, with a thick black beard, anda very strange look in his eye. His voice sounded as if he were trying to imitatesomeone. He did not smile, but merely made a sign with his hand for the interviewer tosit down, and then sat down opposite him."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Paulo took his notepad out of his bag and, to break the ice, asked: ‘Why are all thebooks covered in grey paper?’The man did not appear in the mood for small talk and said: ‘That’s none of yourbusiness.’Startled by his rudeness, Paulo began to laugh: ‘I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offendyou. I was just curious.’Motta continued in the same vein: ‘This is no matter for children.’When the interview was over, Paulo wrote and published his article, but he couldn’tstop thinking about that strange man and his library of books with blank spines. Afterseveral refusals, Motta agreed to meet him again and this time he opened theconversation by saying: ‘I’m the world leader of a society called AA–AstrumArgentum.’ He got to his feet, picked up a copy of The Beatles’ record Sgt. Pepper’sLonely Hearts Club Band and pointed out one of the figures on the crowded collage onthe cover. This was a bald, elderly man, the second along in the photo, next to an Indianguru: ‘This man is called Aleister Crowley, and we are the proponents of his ideas in theworld. Go and find out about him, and then we’ll talk again.’It was only after searching through libraries and second-hand bookshops that Paulodiscovered that there were very few books available in Brazil about the old man on thecover of The Beatles’ album, lost among the images of Mae West, Mahatma Gandhi,Hitler, Jesus Christ and Elvis Presley. While he was preparing to go back to speak to themysterious Motta, he continued to produce the two magazines with Gisa. Since thebudget was not enough to take on even one collaborator, he wrote almost everything. Sothat the readers would not realize what a tiny budget the magazines had to survive on,he used a variety of pseudonyms as well as his own name.At the beginning of 1972, a stranger appeared in the office, which was a modestroom on the tenth floor of a commercial building in the centre of Rio de Janeiro. He waswearing a shiny suit–one of those crease-resistant ones–and a thin tie, and carried anexecutive briefcase, and he announced that he wanted to talk to ‘the writer AugustoFigueiredo’. At the time, Paulo did not connect the visitor with the person who hadphoned him some days earlier, also asking for Augusto Figueiredo. It was enough toawaken his dormant paranoia. The man had the look of a policeman and must havecome there after a tip-off, looking for drugs, perhaps. The problem was that AugustoFigueiredo did not exist; it was one of the names Paulo used to sign his articles.Terrified, but trying to appear calm, he attempted to get rid of the visitor as quicklyas possible, saying: ‘Augusto isn’t here. Do you want to leave a message?’‘No. I need to talk to him. Can I sit and wait for him?’The man was definitely a policeman. He sat at a table, picked up an old copy of APomba, lit a cigarette and started to read, with the air of someone with all the time inthe world. An hour later, he was still there. He had read every past copy of themagazine, but showed no sign of wanting to leave. Paulo recalled the lesson he had"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"learned as a child, when jumping off the bridge into the river: the best way to curtailsuffering was to face the problem head on. He decided to tell the truth–for he wasabsolutely certain this man was a policeman. First, though, he took the precaution ofgoing through all the drawers in the office to make sure that there were no butts leftover from cannabis joints.He summoned up his courage and, blinking nervously, confessed that he had lied:‘You must forgive me, but there is no Augusto Figueiredo here. I’m the person whowrote the article, Paulo Coelho. What can I do for you?’The visitor smiled broadly, held out his arms as if about to embrace him and said:‘Well, you’re the person I want to talk to, man. How do you do? My name is RaulSeixas.’"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14The Devil and PauloA PART FROM THEIR INTEREST in flying saucers and having both been disastrous studentsduring their adolescence, Raul Seixas and Paulo Coelho appeared to have little incommon. Seixas was working as a music producer for a multinational recordingcompany, CBS; his hair was always tidy and he was never seen without a jacket, tie andbriefcase. He had never tried drugs, not even a drag on a cannabis joint. Coelho’s hair,meanwhile, was long and unruly, and he wore hipsters, sandals, necklaces, andspectacles with octagonal purple lenses. He also spent much of his time under theinfluence of drugs. Seixas had a fixed address, and was a real family man, with adaughter, Simone, aged two, while Paulo lived in ‘tribes’ whose members came andwent according to the seasons–in recent months his ‘family’ had been Gisa and StellaPaula, a pretty hippie from Ipanema who was as fascinated as he was by the occult andthe beyond.The differences between the two men were even more marked when it came to theircultural baggage. At twenty-five, Paulo had read and given stars to more than fivehundred books, and he wrote articulately and fluently. As for Raul, despite having spenthis childhood surrounded by his father’s books–his father worked on the railways andwas an occasional poet–he didn’t seem particularly keen on reading. However, one datein their lives had different meanings but was equally important to each of them. On 28June 1967, when Paulo was drugged and taken to the ninth floor of the Dr Eiras clinicfor his third admission, Seixas was twenty-two and getting married to the Americanstudent Edith Wisner in Salvador, Bahia, where he was born. Both believed in astrology,and if they had studied their respective astrological charts they would have seen that thezodiac predicted one certain thing: the two were destined to make a lot of money,whatever they did.When Raul Seixas entered his life, Paulo Coelho was immersed in the hermetic anddangerous universe of satanism. He had begun meeting Marcelo Ramos Motta morefrequently and, after devouring weighty volumes on pentacles, mystical movements,magical systems and astrology, he could understand a little of the work of the bald manon The Beatles’ LP cover. Born in Leamington Spa, England, on 12 October 1875,Aleister Crowley was twenty-three when he reported that he had encountered in Cairo abeing who transmitted to him the Liber AL vel Legis [The Book of the Law], which washis first and most important work on mysticism, the central sacred text of Thelema.The Law of Thelema proclaimed the beginning of an era in which man would be"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"free to realize all his desires. This was the objective contained in the epigraph ‘Do whatthou wilt shall be the whole of the Law’, which was considered the basic rule of conductby Crowley’s followers. Among the instruments recommended to achieve this statewere sexual freedom, the use of drugs and the rediscovery of oriental wisdom. In 1912,Crowley entered the sect known as Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), a Masonic, mystical,magical type of organization of which he soon became the head and the principaltheorist. He called himself ‘the Beast’, and built a temple in Cefalu, in Sicily, but wasexpelled from Italy by the Mussolini government in 1923, accused of promoting orgies.During the Second World War, Crowley was summoned by the writer Ian Fleming,creator of James Bond and an officer in British Naval Intelligence, to help the Britishconsider how superstitions and mysticism among the Nazi leaders could be put to gooduse by the Allies. It was also Aleister Crowley who, through Fleming, suggested toWinston Churchill that he should use the V for Victory sign, which was, in fact, a signof Apophis-Typhon, a god of destruction capable of overwhelming the energies of theNazi swastika.In the world of music it was not only The Beatles who became, in their case onlybriefly, Thelemites, which was the name given to Crowley’s followers. His satanictheories attracted various rock artists and groups such as Black Sabbath, The Clash, IronMaiden and Ozzy Osbourne (who wrote the classic ‘Mr Crowley’). The famousBoleskine House, where Crowley lived for several years, later became the property ofJimmy Page, the Led Zeppelin guitarist. But the English Beast’s ideas also inspiredterrible tragedies: in August 1969, his American disciple Charles Manson headed themassacre of four people who were shot, stabbed and clubbed to death in a mansion inMalibu. Among the victims was the actress Sharon Tate, aged twenty-six, who wasexpecting a baby by her husband, the director Roman Polanski.Paulo appeared to be so influenced by these readings and supernatural practices thatnot even the atrocities committed by Manson brought him back down to earth. Themurderer of Sharon Tate was described as ‘the most evil man on Earth’ by the jury thatcondemned him to death, although this sentence was subsequently commuted to lifeimprisonment. When he read the news, Paulo wrote in his diary: ‘The weapons of warnowadays are the strangest you can find. Drugs, religion, fashion...It’s somethingagainst which it’s impossible to fight. When looked at like this, Charles Manson is acrucified martyr.’Until he met Paulo Coelho, Raul Seixas had never heard of Crowley or of thenomenclature used by those people. He knew nothing about Astrum Argentum, OTO orLiber Oz. He liked reading about flying saucers, but the main object of his interest hadalways been music, and more precisely rock and roll, a musical genre with which Paulohad only a glancing relationship–he liked Elvis Presley, knew the most famous groupsand that was it. Seixas’s passion for rock music had meant he had to repeat his secondyear at São Bento College in Salvador three times, and at eighteen he had had some"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"success in performances in Bahia as leader of the group Os Panteras–The Panthers.However, at the insistence of his future father-in-law, an American Protestant pastor, heabandoned his promising musical career and returned to his studies. He made up for losttime with a revision course, and when he took his entrance exams for the law faculty, hewas among the top entrants. ‘I just wanted to prove to people, to my family, how easy itwas to study and pass exams,’ he said many years later, ‘when for me it wasn’timportant in the least.’ During the first months of his marriage, he supported the familyby giving guitar and English lessons. Before he was even three months into hismarriage, though, Seixas succumbed to temptation.In October 1967, the singer Jerry Adriani went to Salvador after being hired for ashow at the smart Bahian Tennis Club, where the muse of bossa nova, Nara Leão, wasalso performing, along with the comedian Chico Anysio. Adriani was, by then, regardedas a national star among the youth music movement, Jovem Guarda, but dismissed bymore sophisticated audiences as tacky. On the day of the show, a tennis club employeetold the singer that his performance had been cancelled: ‘The group you’ve hired hasgot several black musicians in it, and no blacks are allowed in the club.’Although the Afonso Arinos law had been in place since 1951, making racialdiscrimination a crime, ‘Blacks didn’t enter the Club even through the kitchen door’, inthe words of the song ‘Tradição’, by another famous Bahian, Gilberto Gil. Thisprejudice was even harsher here, since this was a club in Bahia, a state where more than70 per cent of the population were black and of mixed race. Instead of calling thepolice, the show’s impresario chose to hire another group. The first he could think ofwere the defunct Os Panteras, who in the past few months had changed their name toThe Panthers. Seixas was thrilled at the idea of reviving the group and went off into thecity to look for his old accompanists: the bassist Mariano Lanat, the guitarist PerinhoAlbuquerque and the drummer Antônio Carlos Castro, or Carleba–all of them white.The show was a great success, and Os Panteras left the stage to loud applause. At theend of the show, Nara Leão whispered in Jerry Adriani’s ear: ‘That group are reallygood. Why don’t you ask them to play with you?’When, that evening, he received an invitation from the singer for the group to gowith him on a tour of the north and the northeast, due to start the following week, Seixaswas thrilled. An invitation to tour with a nationally famous artist such as Jerry Adrianiwasn’t one that was likely to come around twice. However, he also knew that acceptingthe proposal would be the end of his marriage, and that was too high a cost.He said he was sorry, but he had to refuse: ‘It would be an honour to go on tour withyou, but if I leave home now, my marriage will be finished.’Jerry Adriani doubled the stakes: ‘If that’s the problem, then problem solved: yourwife is invited too. Bring her with you.’As well as giving the couple a rather amusing, unusual honeymoon, the tour was sosuccessful that when it ended, Jerry Adriani convinced Raul and his musicians to move"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"to Rio and turn professional, and at the beginning of 1968 they were all in Copacabana.This adventure did not end happily. Although they managed to record one LP of theirown, in the years that followed, the only work that came their way was playing as abacking group to Adriani. There were times when Seixas had to ask his father for a loanto pay the rent on the house where he, Edith and the other members of the group wereliving. Going back to Bahia because they had run out of money was a very hard thing todo, particularly for Raul, the leader of the group, but there was no other solution. Muchagainst his will, he started giving English lessons again and was beginning to think thathis musical career was over when a proposal came from Evandro Ribeiro, the directorof CBS, to return to work in Rio, not as a band leader but as a music producer. His namehad been suggested to the management of the record company by Jerry Adriani, whowas interested in getting his friend back on the Rio–São Paulo circuit, which was thecentre of Brazilian music production. Wanting to get even with the city that haddefeated him, Seixas did not think twice. He asked Edith to organize the move and, afew days later, he was working, in jacket and tie, in the polluted city centre of Rio,where the CBS offices were. Within a few months, he had become music producer tovarious well-known artists, starting with Adriani.At the end of May 1972, Raul had walked the seven blocks between the CBSbuilding and the offices of A Pomba not merely to praise the non-existent AugustoFigueiredo’s writings on extraterrestrials. He had in his briefcase an article that hehimself had written on flying saucers and wanted to know if A Pomba might beinterested in publishing it. Paulo politely accepted it, said that he would indeed behappy to publish the article, and drew him out on the subject of UFOs and life on otherplanets. He had an ulterior motive for this. The mention of CBS had sparked a rathermore materialistic interest: since Raul enjoyed the magazine and was an executive in amultinational, he might well be persuaded to place advertisements for CBS in A Pomba.The short meeting ended with Raul inviting Paulo to dinner at his house the followingnight, a Thursday. At the time, Coelho never took any decision without consulting his‘family’, Gisa and their flatmate, Stella Paula. Even something as banal as whether ornot to go to someone’s house was subjected to a vote: ‘We had a truly ideologicaldiscussion in that tiny hippie group to decide whether or not we should go and have adrink at Raul’s house.’Even though he realized that, apart from an interest in UFOs, the two appeared tohave nothing in common, Paulo, with one eye on the possibility of getting someadvertising revenue from CBS, decided to accept the invitation. Gisa went with him,while Stella Paula, who was outvoted, felt no obligation to go along as well. On thatThursday evening, on his way to supper, Paulo stopped at a record shop and bought anLP of Bach’s Organ Preludes. The bus taking them from Flamengo to Jardim de Alah–asmall, elegant district between Ipanema and Leblon, in the south of Rio, where Raullived–was stopped at a police checkpoint. Since the crackdown by the dictatorship in"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"December 1968, such checks had become part of life for Brazilians in the large cities.However, when Gisa saw the police get on the bus and start asking the passengers toshow their papers, she felt it was a bad sign, a warning, and threatened to call off themeeting. Paulo, however, would not be moved, and at eight that evening, as agreed, theyrang the bell of Raul’s apartment.The meeting lasted three hours. When he left, the obsessive Paulo stopped at thefirst bar they came to and scribbled on the cover of his Bach LP every detail of theirvisit to the man he still referred to as ‘the guy’. Every blank space on the record coverwas taken up with tiny, almost illegible writing:We were greeted by his wife, Edith, and a little girl who must have been threeat most. It was all very respectable, very proper. They brought in little disheswith canapés...It’s years since I’ve eaten in someone’s house where they hadlittle dishes with canapés. Canapés, how ridiculous!So then the guy comes in: ‘Would you like a whisky?’Well, of course we wanted a whisky! A rich man’s drink. Dinner washardly over and Gisa and I were desperate to leave.Then Raul said: ‘Oh, I wanted to play you some of my music.’Oh, shit, we were going to have to listen to music as well. All I wanted wasto get some advertising out of him. We went into the maid’s room and hepicked up his guitar and played some marvellous music. When he finished, theguy said to me: ‘You wrote that stuff on flying saucers, didn’t you? Well, I’mplanning on going back to being a singer. Would you like to write some lyricsfor me?’I thought: Write lyrics? Me write lyrics for this guy who’s never toucheddrugs in his life! Never put a joint in his mouth. Not even an ordinary cigarette.Anyway, we were just leaving and I hadn’t yet mentioned the advertisement. Iplucked up courage and asked: ‘Since we’re going to publish your article, doyou think you could manage to get an advertisement for CBS in the magazine?’Imagine my astonishment when he said that he had resigned from CBS thatvery day: ‘I’m moving to Philips because I’m going to follow my dream. Iwasn’t born to be a manager, I want to be a singer.’At that moment I understood: I’m the conventional one, this guy deservesthe greatest respect. A guy who leaves a job that gives him everything, hisdaughter, his wife, his maid, his family, his canapés! I left feeling reallyimpressed with the guy.Gisa’s premonitions were not entirely unfounded. She had mistaken the year, but not thedate. While it marked Paulo’s first step in the direction of one of his dreams–fame–25"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"May was, by coincidence, going to be a crucial date, a watershed in his life: the daychosen by destiny, some years later, for his first appointment with the Devil, aceremony he was preparing for when he met Raul Seixas. Under Marcelo RamosMotta’s guidance he felt he was a disciple of the Beast’s battalions. He was determinedto immerse himself in the malignant forces that had seduced Lennon and CharlesManson, and began the process by being accepted into the OTO as a ‘probationer’, thelowest rank in the sect’s hierarchy. He was fortunate that his guide was not Motta butanother militant in the organization, a graduate employee of Petrobras, EuclydesLacerda de Almeida, whose magical name was Frater Zaratustra, or Frater Z, and wholived in Paraíba do Sul, 150 kilometres from Rio. ‘I received a letter, rude as ever, fromMarcelo,’ Paulo wrote to Frater Z when he heard the news. ‘I’m forbidden fromcontacting him except through you.’ It was a relief to have a well-educated man likeEuclydes as his instructor rather than the uncouth Marcelo Motta, who treated all hissubordinates appallingly. Extracts from letters sent to militants of the OTO by ParzivalXI (as Motta self-importantly called himself) show that Paulo was being quiterestrained when describing the leader of the followers of the Devil as ‘rude’:I’d prefer you not to write to me any more.

In the first, one gets the impression that Paulo will be working on thepublication by Editora Três, in São Paulo, of the book The Equinox of the Gods, byCrowley and translated into Portuguese by Motta: ‘I got in touch with Editora Trêsthrough their representative in Rio, and we shall soon see whether or not they’re goingto publish Equinox of the Gods. Paulo Coelho is young, enthusiastic and imaginative,but it’s too early for us to assume that they really will publish the book.’ In the second,"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Euclydes is castigated for having told Paulo too much and too soon about Parzival XI’spower: ‘Paulo Coelho said that you told him I destroyed the Masons in Brazil. You talktoo much. Even if it were true, Paulo Coelho doesn’t have the magical maturity tounderstand how these things are done, which is why he’s confused.’At the time, Paulo had had his own experiences of being in contact with the Devil.Some months before getting to know Motta and the OTO, during one of his regularanxiety crises, he was full of complaints. The reasons were many, but behind them laythe usual fact: he was nearly twenty-five and still just a nobody, without the remotestchance of becoming a famous writer. The situation seemed hopeless and the pain thistime was such that, instead of asking for help from the Virgin Mary or St Joseph as heusually did, he decided to make a pact with the Prince of Darkness. If the Devil gavehim the power to realize all his dreams, Paulo would give him his soul in exchange. ‘Asan educated man who knows the philosophical principles that govern the world,humanity and the Cosmos,’ Paulo wrote in his diary, ‘I know perfectly well that theDevil does not signify Evil, but just one of the poles in the equilibrium of humanity.’Using a fountain pen with red ink (‘the colour of this supernatural being’), he began towrite out his pact in the form of a letter to the Devil. In the first line he made it clearthat he was setting out the conditions and was not willing to deal with intermediaries:You have wanted this for a long time. I felt that You were beginning to closethe circle around me and I know that You are stronger than I am. You are moreinterested in buying my soul than I am in selling it. Whatever the case, I needto have an idea of the price that You are going to pay me. For this reason, fromtoday, 11 November 1971, until 18 November, I’m going to do an experiment. Iwill speak directly to You, the King of the Other Pole.In order to confirm this agreement he took a flower out of a vase and crushed it, at thesame time proposing to Satan a kind of spectral test: ‘I’m going to crush this flower andeat it. From now on, for the next seven days, I’m going to do everything I want and I’mgoing to get what I want, because You will be helping me. If I’m satisfied with theresults, I will give You my soul. If a ritual is necessary, I take it upon myself to carry itout.’As a proof of good faith, Paulo promised the Devil that, during this experimentalperiod, he would reciprocate by not praying to or saying the names of those consideredsacred by the Catholic Church. But he did make it clear that this was a test, not alifelong contract. ‘I retain the right to go back,’ he went on, still in red, ‘and I want toadd that I’m only doing this because I find myself in such a state of complete despair.’The agreement lasted less than an hour. He closed his notebook, and went out tohave a cigarette and walk along the beach. When he returned home, he was deathly pale,"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"terrified at the mad thing he had done. He opened his notebook again and wrote incapital letters that took up the whole page:PACT CANCELLEDI OVERCAME TEMPTATION!Paulo felt sure that he had tricked the Devil, but this ruse did not work for long.Although he and the Devil did not meet this time, he continued to invoke the spirit ofevil in his articles for A Pomba and in a new enterprise in which he had becomeinvolved, the storyboards for comic strips. Beings from the Beyond created by him werebrought to life in Gisa’s drawings and began to illustrate the pages of the magazine. Thepositive reaction to the series Os Vampiristas, which told of the troubles and adventuresof a small, peaceful solitary vampire, convinced Gisa to send her work to King Features,an American agency that distributed comic strips, but she received no reply. The coupledid, though, manage to get some of their work into two of the main daily Rionewspapers, O Jornal and Jornal do Brasil, creating a special cartoon about the littlevampire for the latter’s children’s supplement, which came out on Sundays. They alsocreated a highly popular character, Curingão, whose image was used on lottery tickets.From time to time, one of their comic strips even appeared in Pasquim, the magazinefavoured by the Rio intelligentsia.A Pomba was managing to survive with almost no advertising revenue and evenachieved sales of 20,000, a real achievement in the tiny counterculture market;however, by the middle of 1972, it was heavily in debt, and looked set to take 2001down with it. When the publisher, Eduardo Prado, announced that he was thinking ofclosing both publications, Paulo and Gisa moved to the newspaper Tribuna daImprensa, where they produced a whole page that was published on Saturdays and giventhe name of the magazine that had died after only two issues–2001.This change of medium was another step towards their work emerging from thesubworld of flying saucers, elves and sorcerers to reach a wider public. Although incomparison with the other Rio dailies, Tribuna didn’t publish many copies, it hadearned respect as a fighter. It had been founded in 1949 by the journalist Carlos Lacerdain order to combat the ideas, the supporters and the future government of PresidentGetúlio Vargas (1951–54) and now, under the editorship of Hélio Fernandes, it was thefavourite target for the military dictatorship’s censors. The arrival of Paulo and Gisa inthe old building on Rua do Lavradio, near Lapa, coincided with the most repressiveperiod in the entire history of the dictatorship, and this was reflected in the daily life ofthe paper. For three years, the offices of Tribuna had been visited every night by armyofficers, who would read everything and then decide what could and could not bepublished. According to Hélio Fernandes, a fifth of their daily output was thrown in the"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"rubbish bin by the censors. He himself was an example of what happened to thosetargeted by the regime’s violence, for he had been arrested no fewer than twenty-seventimes since 1964 and imprisoned twice. However, since the military were not tooconcerned about alchemy and the supernatural, the page produced by Paulo and Gisaremained untouched.The visibility they achieved in the paper encouraged Paulo to go to the advertisingdepartment of Petrobras and show them a comic strip he and Gisa had created to behanded out at their petrol stations.The man they met had approved the idea, but then Paulo, eager to make the projecta success, said: ‘Just so that there’s no risk to Petrobras, we can work for free for thefirst month.’The man turned round and said: ‘For free? Sorry, but you’re clearly a real amateur.Here no one does anything for free. Go and do a bit more work and try again whenyou’re a professional.’In August, while he was still smarting from this rejection, Paulo received aninvitation to go with his mother and maternal grandmother, Lilisa, for a three-week tripto Europe. He was heavily into his journalistic work, and hesitated before agreeing, butthen it wasn’t every day that one was invited on a trip to Europe with all expenses paid.Added to this, he could leave several cartoons ready, as well as the Tribuna page, forGisa to illustrate and design while he was away, since his mother’s invitation did notinclude his girlfriend. During the twenty-one day trip, which started in Nice and endedin Paris, with stops in Rome, Milan, Amsterdam and London, Paulo visited museums,ruins and cathedrals. Apart from two or three occasions in Amsterdam, when he escapedhis mother’s vigilance in order to smoke a joint, the trip meant that he went almost amonth without his daily intake of drugs.Having been brought up by a methodical, obsessive mother, Paulo was furious withwhat he found when he arrived home. He wrote: ‘The house is a complete tip, whichreally annoyed me. It hasn’t even been swept. The electricity bill hasn’t been paid, norhas the rent. The page for Tribuna hasn’t been handed in, which is utterly irresponsible.I’m so upset by all this that I have nothing else to say.’However, not everything was bad. While he was away, a tempting invitation hadarrived in the post. Professor Glória Albues, who worked for the education departmentin Mato Grosso, had finally organized a project that the two had thought up when theyhad met up in Rio. The idea was that Paulo would spend three weeks every two monthsin three cities in Mato Grosso–Campo Grande, Três Lagoas (now in Mato Grosso doSul, a state that did not exist at the time) and Cuiabá–teaching a course in theatre andeducation for teachers and pupils in state schools. The salary was tempting–1,500cruzeiros a month, which was double what he earned on A Pomba and 2001. There wasanother reason that led Paulo to exchange the delights of Rio for the inhospitable landsof Mato Grosso. When the idea for the course had first come up, he hadn’t been"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"involved with the OTO, but now, eager to spread Crowley’s ideas, the thought came tohim: Why not change the course into a black magic workshop?"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15Paulo and RaulEITHER ALONE OR WITH GISA, who was following him on his journey to satanism, Paulobegan to try out some so-called magical exercises. One he frequently performedconsisted in going to a park to pick a leaf of Sansevieria trifasciata, a plant with hard,pointed leaves, popularly known in English as mother-in-law’s tongue and in Brazil asSt George’s sword. Performed in public, this exercise was likely to expose the novice toa certain amount of ridicule, since it was then necessary to walk ten steps holding theplant as though it were a real sword, turn towards the setting sun and then bow to thefour points of the compass, pointing the ‘sword’ at each and shouting at the top of one’svoice: ‘Strength lies in the West!’ Each step to the left was accompanied by a roar, witheyes raised heavenwards: ‘Knowledge lies in the South! Protection lies in the East!Victory lies in the North!’He would then take the leaf home, where he would cut it into eleven pieces (elevenbeing the Thelemites’ magic number) with a penknife or an ordinary knife that he hadpreviously thrust into the ground, and then heated over a fire and washed in sea water.After this he would arrange the eleven pieces on the kitchen table to form the symbol ofMars–a circle topped by a small arrow, which also represents the male sex–whileboiling up some water in a saucepan. He would then mix the pieces up with the tornpetals of two yellow roses and add them to the boiling water. The entire ceremony hadto be performed so that the thick, viscous liquid thus produced would be ready atprecisely eleven at night, which, according to the Liber Oz, is the hour of the Sun. Hewould then add it to his bath water, in which he would immerse himself until midnight,the hour of Venus. After performing one such ceremony, Paulo dried himself and wrotein his diary, with the house in almost total darkness and his notebook lit just by a singlecandle:I realize that this ritual might appear naive. It lasted in total almost two hours.But all I can say is that for the greater part of the time I was in touch with adifferent dimension, where things are interconnected in the Laws (SecondCauses). I can feel the mechanism, but I am not yet able to understand it. Norcan I rationalize the mechanism. I feel only that intuition works in closeconjunction with rationalization and that these two spheres almost touch eachother. Something leads me to believe that the Devil really does exist."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Another ceremony he frequently performed was the so-called Ritual of the LesserPentagram, which involved spreading out on the floor a white sheet on which one had topaint a green five-pointed star. The star was surrounded by a length of twine dipped insulphur, with which Paulo would draw the symbol of Mars. He would turn off all thelights, and then hang a lamp from the ceiling, immediately above the centre of thepentagram, so that it created a column of light. With sword in hand and completelynaked, he would turn to the south, step into the middle of the sheet and adopt the‘Dragon pose’–a yoga position in which the person crouches on the floor with one legforward and the other back–and then jump up and down like a toad while repeatinginvocations to the Devil. On one of these occasions, the ceremony ended very strangely,as he recorded in his diary:After half an hour, my personal problems began seriously to interfere with myconcentration, thus wasting a great deal of energy. I changed from the Dragonpose to the Ibis pose, finally crouching in the centre of the circle, shaking mybody. This made me sexually excited and I ended up masturbating, even thoughI was only thinking about the column of light over the circle. I ejaculated intothe column of light in several successive spasms. This brought me a feeling oftotal confirmation. Obviously I felt very guilty while I was masturbating, butthis soon passed, so profound was my state of ecstasy.It was during this time that Paulo was preparing for his first stay in Mato Grosso. Heleft various texts and storyboards ready for Tribuna and the other publications he wasworking for and typed out a programme for the course. Anyone not in the know wouldhave had difficulty identifying any magical or satanic content. ‘I used this trick onpurpose, so that no one would realize,’ he confessed years later, ‘because I knew it wasan act of supreme irresponsibility to use magical techniques and rituals in order to giveclasses to teachers and adolescents...There I was performing black magic: I was usingthem without their knowledge, innocently, for my own magical experiments.’ Beforeleaving, Paulo asked permission from Frater Zaratustra to use Hermes Trismegistus’Emerald Tablet on the course. This was a text containing such statements as: ‘By thismeans wilt thou partake of the honours of the whole world. And Darkness will fly fromthee’, and ‘With this thou wilt be able to overcome all things and transmute all that isfine and all that is coarse.’Unaware that they were to be used as guinea pigs in the experiments of a satanicsect, the people of Mato Grosso received him with open arms. The local press heraldedhis arrival at each of the towns participating in the project with praise, hyperbole andeven a pinch of fantasy. After comparing him with Plínio Marcos and NelsonRodrigues, two of the greatest names in Brazilian drama, the Campo Grande Diário da"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Serra congratulated the government for having invited Paulo to bring to Mato Grosso acourse ‘that was crowned with success in Rio de Janeiro, Belém do Pará and Brasília’.The treatment conferred on him by the Jornal do Povo, in Três Lagoas, was even morelavish:Now it’s the turn of Três Lagoas. We have the opportunity to experience one ofthe great names in Brazilian theatre: Paulo Coelho. He may not look it, butPaulo Coelho is a great man! The prototype of concrete art, in which everythingis strong, structured and growing...Such a figure could not help but be noticed,and that is what drives him on and what makes of him a natural communicator.While not wishing to exaggerate, we could compare him symbolically withChrist, who also came to create.He had not received such reverential attention since Aracaju, when he had plagiarizedan article by Carlos Heitor Cony. Cast in the role of full-time missionary, Paulo tookadvantage of his few free hours to become still more steeped in mysticism, and it didn’tmuch matter to him how he gained access to this mysterious world. In Três Lagoas,‘with the help of a Tibetan who is there fulfilling a mission’, he went to theheadquarters of the Brazilian Society of Eubiosis, a group that argued for living inharmony with nature, and also the Masonic lodge of the Grand Order of Brazil. When helearned that there was a village of acculturated Indians on the edge of the city, hedecided to visit them in order to find out about native witchcraft. After his three weekswere up, he recorded the first results of his time there:At the beginning my work with the Emerald Tablet was a real disappointment.No one really understood how it worked (not even me, despite all theworkshops and improvisations I had done). All the same the seed was sown inthe minds of the students and some of them really changed their way ofthinking and began to think in different ways. One female pupil went into atrance during a class. The vast majority reacted negatively and the work onlytook on some meaning on the last day of the classes when I managed one wayor another to break down their emotional barriers. Obviously, I’m talking abouta purely theatrical use of the Tablet. Perhaps if the last day had been the first Icould have done something interesting with them.Ah, before I forget: one day, I went for a walk in the city to collect some plants(I had just finished reading Paracelsus and was going to perform a ceremony)and I saw a cannabis plant growing outside a branch of the Bank of Brazil."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Imagine that!On his return to Rio, Paulo learned from a colleague at Tribuna that the editorial teamat O Globo was looking for staff. The idea of writing for what claimed to be ‘thegreatest newspaper in the country’ was very tempting, and he managed to arrange aninterview with Iran Frejat, the much-feared editor. If he got a job there, he would haveat his disposal a fantastic means of spreading the ideals of the OTO. Several times in hiscorrespondence with Frater Zaratustra he had suggested allowing the weekly page inTribuna to be used by the sect, but they had never asked him to do so. When he toldRaul Seixas of his interest in a position at O Globo, his friend tried to dissuade himfrom the idea, again suggesting a musical partnership: ‘Forget it. Don’t go and work forsome newspaper, let’s write music. TV Globo are going to re-record Beto Rockefeller[an innovative and very successful soap opera that was shown on the now defunct TVTupi from 1968 to 1969] and they’ve asked me to write the soundtrack. Why don’t wedo it together? I’ll write the music and you can write the lyrics.’While Paulo was still torn between the supernatural and the need to earn a living,Raul was building his career as a singer, devoting himself entirely to music. He had anLP on sale–Sociedade da Grã Ordem Kavernista, which was recorded almost secretly atCBS a few weeks before he resigned–and he was getting ready for the seventhInternational Song Festival being put on by Rede Globo. For Paulo, accepting apartnership would mean going back to poetry, which he had sworn never to do. For themoment at least the position at O Globo seemed more achievable and this was what hewas going to try for.He turned up at the appointed time for his interview with Frejat, introduced himselfto the chief reporter, who appeared to be in a very bad mood, and sat down in a cornerof the office waiting to be called. Before leaving home, he had put a book of poems bySt John of the Cross in his bag to help take his mind off things while waiting. At two inthe afternoon, an hour after he had arrived, Frejat had still not even so much as glancedat him, although he had walked past him several times, giving orders and handing outpapers to various desks. Paulo stood up, got himself a coffee, lit a cigarette and satdown again. When the clock showed three he lost patience. He ripped the pages out ofthe book he was reading, tore them into tiny pieces, gathered them up and depositedthem on Frejat’s desk.This unexpected gesture caught the journalist by surprise, and he burst out laughingand said: ‘What’s up, boy? Have you gone mad?’Paulo said quietly, but forcefully: ‘I’ve been waiting for two hours–didn’t younotice? Are you behaving like this just because I want a job? That’s so disrespectful!’Frejat’s response was a surprising one: ‘Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize you werehere for the job. Well, let’s give you a test. If you pass it, the job’s yours. You can startnow. Go to the Santa Casa and count the dead.’"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"The dead? Yes, one of his daily tasks would be to go to the Santa Casa deMisericórdia and to two other large hospitals in Rio to get lists of the names of thedead, which would then appear on the newspaper’s obituary pages the following day. Inspite of his previous experience on Diário de Notícias and Tribuna, he was going tostart at O Globo as a cub reporter. As a trainee, on the lowest rung of the ladder, hewould work seven hours a day, with one day off a week, for a salary of 1,200 cruzeiros amonth–some US$408. His first weeks at the paper were spent on ‘reports on still lives’,or ‘coverage of a pacifist demonstration’ as he called his daily visits to the city’smortuaries. The famous, such as politicians and artists, were the domain of the moreexperienced reporters, who would write obituaries or ‘memorials’. When this macabredaily round finished early he would go to the red light district of Mangue to chat to theprostitutes.Although he didn’t have a formal contract, which was the case with the majority ofcub reporters on most Brazilian newspapers (meaning that they had no form of socialsecurity), he could have his meals at O Globo’s very cheap canteen. For a mere 6cruzeiros–US$1.75–he could have lunch or dinner in the canteen, along with the ownerof O Globo, Roberto Marinho. A few days after meeting Marinho in the canteen queue,Paulo learned from Frejat that ‘Dr Roberto’, as he was known, had issued an ultimatum:either Paulo cut his hair, which at the time was down to his shoulders, or he need notreturn to the office. Working on O Globo was more important than having long hair, andso he gave in to the demand without protest and trimmed his black mane.Paulo was, in fact, used to reporting on two or three emergency situations, whichmeant that his superiors could see that this cub reporter with dark circles under his eyesknew how to write and had the confidence to carry out an interview. While he was neversingled out to report on matters of major importance, he went out on to the streets everyday with the other more experienced reporters, and, unlike some of them, he almostnever returned empty-handed. What his superiors didn’t know was that when he failedto find the interviewees he needed, he simply made them up. On one such occasion, hewas told to file a report on people whose work centred on Carnival. He spent the day outin the streets, returned to the office and, in the early evening, handed to his editor, theexperienced Henrique Caban, five pages of interviews with, among others, ‘Joaquim deSouza, nightwatchman’, ‘Alice Pereira, waitress’ and ‘Adilson Lopes de Barros, barowner’. The article ended with an ‘analysis of the behaviour of the inhabitants of Rioduring Carnival’, a statement made by a ‘psychologist’ going by the highly suspiciousname of ‘Adolfo Rabbit’. That night Paulo noted at the top of his carbon copy of thearticle, which he had taken home, something that neither Caban nor anyone else wouldever know: ‘This material was COMPLETELY invented.’While he may occasionally have resorted to such low stratagems, he was, in fact,doing well at the newspaper. Less than two months after starting work, he saw one ofhis interviews–a real one this time–with Luis Seixas, the president of the National"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Institute of Social Security (INPS), on the front page of the next day’s edition of OGlobo: ‘Free medicine from the INPS’. Following this he was given the news that if hemoved to being pauteiro de madrugada (sub-editor on the early-morning shift), hewould receive a 50-per-cent salary increase. Most applicants for the position were putoff by having to work every day from two until nine in the morning; however, for aninsomniac like him, this was no problem.The pauteiro began by reading all the competing newspapers, the first editions ofwhich had been bought at the newspaper stands in the centre of town, and comparingthem with the early edition of O Globo, in order to decide which items might be worthincluding in later editions of O Globo. Once this was done, he would listen to the radionews to see what were going to be the major news items of the day and then draw upguidelines for the reporters when they arrived at nine o’clock as to what they shouldinvestigate and whom they should interview. He also had to decide which of the night’sevents, if any, merited the presence of a reporter or photographer. At first, he longed forsomething important to happen while he was working. ‘One of these days, some reallybig news story will break while I’m on duty, and I’ll have to cover it,’ he noted in hisdiary. ‘I’d prefer a different shift, but working this one isn’t unpleasant, if it weren’t forthat bastard Frejat, who keeps me hanging on here in the morning.’ During his sixmonths in the post, only one thing required him to mobilize reporters andphotographers: the murder of the footballer Almir Albuquerque, or ‘Pernambuquinho’,a forward in the Flamengo football team, who was shot by Portuguese tourists during afight in the Rio Jerez restaurant in the South Zone of the city. Mostly, though, the nightspassed without incident, which left time for him, as he sat alone in the office, to fillpages of notes that he later stuck into his diary.I don’t think Frejat likes me. He told someone that I’m a ‘pseudo-intellectual’.[...] As I said to Gisa, what I like about journalism is that no one lastslong...Frejat’s fall is long overdue and it’s going to happen, because the wholeproduction team is pressing for it. There are no nice people in journalism.Anyone nice is basically fucked.[...] I read in the newspaper that someone knifed his wife to death becauseshe never did anything. I’m going to cut out the article and leave it for Gisa toread. I hope she gets the message.[...] Adalgisa went to Minas leaving the house a complete tip. She didn’thand in our pages to Tribuna, she didn’t pay the electricity bill and she didn’teven wash any clothes. These things make me so angry. It seems that she hasn’tgot the slightest idea of what living together means. Now I’ve got no cash topay the electricity bill and the house is going to be in darkness. When shespoke to me on the phone she said that she’s had too much work, but it’snothing to do with that. She’s just completely irresponsible."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Before joining O Globo Paulo had agreed to lead the drama course in Mato Grosso, andat the end of 1972, after much insistence, he managed to get the newspaper to give himthree weeks’ unpaid leave. However, at the beginning of the following year the problemarose again. ‘I’m going to have to choose between the course in Mato Grosso and thework here on the biggest newspaper in the country,’ he wrote in his diary. ‘Caban says Ican’t go, and if I have to give up one of them, I’m going to have to leave the paper.’Besides, Raul Seixas was continuing to pursue him with the idea of working together,and to show that his interest in having him as a lyricist was genuine, Seixas had done avery seductive thing: he let it be known that the song ‘Caroço de Manga’, which he hadwritten for the theme music of the new version of Beto Rockefeller, was in fact by himand Paulo Coelho. Although it was not uncommon in the recording world for acomposer to ‘share authorship’ of a composition with a friend, this also meant an equaldivision of any royalties. Raul Seixas was slowly beginning to win a place in his life.Paulo wrote:It’s so peaceful working at night. I didn’t take a bath today. I slept from nine inthe morning until seven at night. I got up to find that Gisa hadn’t done anywork. We telephoned Raul telling him that we can’t meet him today.[...] I’m tired. I spent all day typing and now I can’t remember the music Ipromised Raul.[...] Raul is full of silly scruples about writing commercial music. Hedoesn’t understand that the more you control the media, the more influence youhave.As he had foreseen, in April 1973, Paulo had to decide whether or not to continue at OGlobo. As had become his normal practice whenever he had to make a decision,however unimportant, he left it to the I Ching or the Book of Changes, to choose. Hewas alone at home and, after a period of concentration, he threw the three coins of theChinese oracle on the table and noted in his diary the hexagrams that were revealed.There was no doubt: the I Ching warned him against working on the newspaper andadvised him that it would mean ‘a slow and prolonged exercise leading to misfortune’.He needed nothing more. The following morning, his short-lived career on O Globocame to an end. The outcome had been good, even as regards his bank balance. Themoney he had earned by selling his and Gisa’s cartoons, along with what he had beenpaid for the course at Mato Grosso, their page in Tribuna and his work at O Globo, notonly covered his day-to-day expenses but meant that he, ever cautious, could startinvesting his modest savings in the stock market. ‘I lost my money buying shares in theBank of Brazil. I’m ruined...’ he recorded at one stage in his diary, only to cheer up afew days later. ‘The shares in Petrobras that were only 25 when I bought them are at 300"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"today.’Between the time when he resigned from O Globo and the start of his partnershipwith Raul Seixas, Paulo did a little of everything. Alongside the various other bits ofwork he had been doing, he did some teaching and some theatre directing, and workedas an actor in a soft-porn movie. No longer having to spend his nights working in theeditorial office, which had meant he had to sleep during the day, he began to meet upwith Raul either at his place or his own in order to begin their much-postponedpartnership. The thought of working together had another attraction for Paulo: if‘Caroço de Manga’ was already generating substantial royalties, what would he earn ifhe were the lyricist on a hit song?As someone who, in a very short space of time, had composed more than eightysongs recorded by various artistes–although he claimed not to like any of them–Raulhad enough experience to be able to rid Paulo of any negative feelings he might stillhave about writing poetry. ‘You don’t have to say things in a complicated way whenyou want to speak seriously to people,’ Raul would say during their manyconversations. ‘In fact, the simpler you are the more serious you can be.’ ‘Writingmusic is like writing a story in twenty lines that someone can listen to ten times withoutgetting bored. If you can do that, you’ll have made a huge leap: you’ll have written awork of art everyone can understand.’And so they began. As the months went by, the two became not just musicalpartners but great friends or, as they liked to tell journalists, ‘close enemies’. They andtheir partners went out together and visited each other often. It did not take much forRaul and Edith to be seduced by the disturbing allure of drugs and black magic. At thetime, in fact, drugs had taken second place in Paulo’s life, such was his fascination forthe mysteries revealed to him by Frater Zaratustra and the OTO. The much proclaimed‘close enmity’ between Paulo and Raul wasn’t just an empty expression, and appears tohave arisen along with their friendship. While Raul had opened the doors of fame andfortune to his new friend, it was Paulo who knew how to reach the world of secretthings, a universe to which ordinary mortals had no access. Raul held the route to fame,but it was Paulo who knew the way to the Devil.The first fruits of their joint labours appeared in 1973 as an LP, Krig-Ha, Bandolo!,the title being taken from one of Tarzan’s war cries. Of the five songs with lyrics byPaulo, only one, ‘Al Capone’, became a hit that people would hum in the street. Krig-Haalso revealed Raul Seixas to be an excellent lyricist in his own right. At least three ofthe songs he composed and wrote–‘Mosca na Sopa’, ‘Metamorfose Ambulante’ and‘Ouro de Tolo’–continued to be played on the radio years after his death in 1989. TheLP may not have been a blockbuster, but it meant that Paulo finally saw money pouringinto his bank account. When he asked for his balance at his branch of the Banco doBrasil in Copacabana a few weeks after the launch of Krig-Ha, he couldn’t believe itwhen he saw that the record company, Philips, had deposited no less than 240 million"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"cruzeiros–about US$200,000–which, to him, was a real fortune.The success of the disc meant that Paulo and Gisa, Raul and Edith could really pushthe boat out. They flew to the United States and, after spending a childish week atDisney World in Florida, visited Memphis, the birthplace of Elvis Presley, and thenspent a glorious, hectic month in New York. On one of their many outings in the BigApple, the two couples knocked at the door of the Dakota building, the grey, neo-Gothic, somewhat sinister apartment block opposite Central Park where John Lennonlived and which had also provided the setting for that classic of satanism, Rosemary’sBaby, directed by Roman Polanski. With typical Brazilian immodesty, Paulo and Raulseemed to assume that the success of Krig-Ha was recommendation enough for thesetwo puny rockers to fraternize with the unassailable writer of ‘Imagine’. On their returnto Brazil, Paulo and Raul gave several interviews, some for international publications,in which they gave details of their conversation with Lennon, who despite a heavy coldhad, according to them, received them with his wife, Yoko Ono, to chat, swapcompositions and even consider the possibility of working together. A press releasedescribed their meeting:We only got to meet John Lennon the day before our return. We went therewith a journalist from a Brazilian TV channel. As soon as we sat down, thejournalist asked about his separation from Yoko. John immediately told thejournalist to leave, saying that he wasn’t going to waste his time on gossip.Because of this, the meeting began rather tensely, with John warning us that hewould take a very dim view of any attempt on our part to capitalize on ourmeeting for the purposes of promoting ourselves in Brazil. After a few minutes,the tension lifted and we talked non-stop for half an hour about the present andthe future. The results of this meeting will be revealed bit by bit as the situationdevelops.It was a complete lie. As time went by the truth behind the story emerged. Paulo andRaul never visited John Lennon’s apartment; nor were they received by Yoko Ono. Thenearest they got to John Lennon was the porter at the Dakota building, who merelyinformed them over the intercom that ‘Mr Lennon is not at home’. The same pressrelease included another invention: that Lennon had been most impressed by the projectPaulo and Raul were preparing to launch in Brazil, the Sociedade Alternativa, theAlternative Society.The plan was to create a community based on an experiment developed by AleisterCrowley at the beginning of the twentieth century in Cefalu, in Sicily. The place chosenas the site of the ‘City of the Stars’, as Raul called it, was Paraíba do Sul, whereEuclydes Lacerda, or Frater Zaratustra, lived. Raul had absorbed the world of drugs and"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"magic so quickly that a year after his first meeting with Paulo, there was no sign of thesmart businessman who had come to the office of Pomba to discuss flying saucers. Henow sported a thick beard and a magnificent mane of black hair, and had starteddressing extravagantly as well, favouring flares that were very tight in the leg and verywide at the bottom, and lamé jackets which he wore without a shirt underneath, thusrevealing his pale, sunken, bony chest.When they returned from their American trip, Raul and Paulo began to create whatwas to be by far their greatest success–the LP Gita. Of the eleven songs chosen for thedisc, seven had lyrics by Paulo and of these at least three became the duo’s themetunes–‘Medo da Chuva’, ‘Gita’ and ‘Sociedade Alternativa’. ‘Medo da Chuva’ revealedthe lyricist’s somewhat unorthodox views on marriage (‘It’s a pity that you think I’myour slave/Saying that I’m your husband and I can’t leave/Like the stones on the beach Istay at your side/Knowing nothing of the loves life brought me, but that I neverknew...’). The title song, ‘Gita’, was no more than a translation of the dialogue betweenKrishna and Arjuna found in Bhagavad Gita, the Hindu sacred text which they had justread. The most intriguing song on the album, though, was the sixth, ‘SociedadeAlternativa’–or, rather, what was intriguing was what the words concealed. At firstsight, the words appear to be an innocent surrealist game based on a single chorus,which is repeated throughout the song:If I want and you wantTo take a bath in a hatOr to wait for Father ChristmasOr to talk about Carlos GardelThen let’s do it!It was the refrain that opens and closes the piece that concealed the mystery.Do what you want is the whole of the law.Viva! Viva! Viva the Sociedade Alternativa!As if wanting to leave no doubt as to their intentions, the authors transcribed word forword entire texts from the Liber Oz, finally showing their hand and making theirallegiances crystal clear. While Raul sang the refrain, a backing track of his own voicesang:Number 666 is called Aleister Crowley!Viva! Viva!"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Viva the Sociedade Alternativa!The law of ThelemaViva! Viva!Viva the Sociedade Alternativa!The law of the strongThat is our law and the joy of the worldViva! Viva!Viva the New Age!Although only the few initiates to the world of Crowley would understand this, PauloCoelho and Raul Seixas had decided to become the spokesmen of OTO and, therefore,of the Devil. For many of their audience this was a coded message written to confusethe censors and arguing for a new society as an alternative to the military dictatorship.This also seemed to be the government’s view, because when ‘Sociedade Alternativa’was released, the censors forbade Raul to sing it when he toured Brazil.With or without censorship, the fact is that everything was going so well that Pauloconcluded that his days of material and emotional penury were over. That evening, as hesometimes did, instead of writing, he recorded his diary on tape, talking as if he were onstage:On 15 April 1974, at the age of twenty-six, I, Paulo Coelho, finally finishedpaying for my crimes. Only at twenty-six did I become fully aware of this. Nowgive me my reward.I want what’s due to me.And what’s due to me will be whatever I want!And I want money!I want power!I want fame, immortality and love!While he was waiting for his other wishes to come true, he enjoyed the money, fameand love that had already come his way. At the beginning of May, Raul invited him andGisa to go to Brasília, where he was going to do three shows during the Festival of theNations being held in the federal capital on 10, 11 and 12 May. At the same time, theywere going to start promoting the LP Gita, which was to be launched a few weeks later.A slave to the I Ching, Paulo threw the three coins several times until it was confirmedthat the trip would present no danger.They were staying at the smart Hotel Nacional when, on the Friday afternoon, theday of the first show, the two were summoned by the Federal Police to be given theusual talk by the censors as to what could and could not be sung in public. The colonel"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"and bureaucrat who received them explained that in their case the only banned song was‘Sociedade Alternativa’. The sports stadium where the show was to be held was packed,and the first two shows passed off without incident. On the Sunday, the night of thefinal show, Raul, after spending the afternoon and evening smoking cannabis, had whathe called ‘a turn’. He was unable to remember a single word of the songs on theprogramme. While the band kept the audience entertained, he squatted at the edge of thestage and whispered to his partner, who was sitting in the first row: ‘Help me, will you?I’m in deep shit. Get up here and keep the public quiet for a while, while I go and splashmy face with water.’ With the microphone in his hand, Raul introduced Paulo to thecrowd as ‘my dear partner’ and left him to deal with the problem. Since the audiencewere already clapping in time to the band, shouting out the banned refrain, Paulo simplydid the same and began to sing along with them:Viva! Viva! Viva the Sociedade Alternativa!Viva! Viva! Viva the Sociedade Alternativa!When he returned to Rio, he described the weekend in Brasília in just a few lines: ‘Itwas a very quiet trip. On Friday we talked to the censor and a colonel from the FederalPolice. On Sunday, I talked to the crowd for the first time, although I was completelyunprepared. Any mention of the Alternative Society is restricted to interviews.’During that week Paulo made an important decision: he formalized his acceptanceinto the OTO as a probationer or novice, when he swore ‘eternal devotion to the GreatWork’. From 19 May ‘of the year 1974 of the Common Era’ onwards, for followers ofthe Devil, Paulo Coelho de Souza’s ‘profane name’ would disappear and be replaced bythe ‘magical name’ that he himself had chosen: Eternal Light, or Staars, or, simply, 313.After sending his oath off in the post, he noted in his diary: ‘Having been invoked sooften, He must be breathing fire from his nostrils somewhere near by.’ He was. On themorning of 25 May, six days after his entrance into the world of darkness, Paulo wasfinally to have his much-desired meeting with the Devil."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16A devil of a different sortTHE LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY that Philips had deposited in Paulo’s bank account theprevious year was just a hint of what was to come. Following the enormous success ofKrig-Ha, Bandolo! the recording company launched a single featuring ‘Gita’ and ‘NãoPare na Pista’, the latter written on the Rio–Bahia highway when the two were returningfrom a few days’ rest in Dias d’Ávila, in the interior of Bahia, where Raul’s parentslived. The aim of the single was merely to give the public a taster of the LP that wouldbe released in June, but in less than a month it had sold more than a hundred thousandcopies, which won the creators an unexpectedly early Gold Disc, the first of six prizesthat the two songs went on to win. Each time a radio station unwittingly made aninvocation to the Devil as they played the refrain ‘Viva! Viva a Sociedade Alternativa!’meant more money for Raul and Paulo. In April 1974, Paulo bought a large apartment inRua Voluntários da Pátria, in Botafogo, a few blocks from the estate where he had beenborn and spent his childhood, and he moved in there with Gisa.On Friday, 24 May, two weeks after their short stay in Brasília, Raul telephoned tosay that he had been ordered to go to the political police–known as the Dops–on thefollowing Monday in order to ‘provide some information’. Being accustomed tofrequent invitations to discuss which songs could appear in shows or on records, hedidn’t appear to be worried, but just in case, he asked his partner to go with him. Assoon as he rang off, Paulo consulted the I Ching as to whether there was any risk ingoing to the Dops. Since the answer seemed to be ‘No’–or at least so it seemed, foraccording to its followers, the interpretation of the oracle is not always very precise–hethought no more about the matter.When he woke on the Saturday morning, Paulo found a note on the bedside tablefrom Gisa, saying that she had gone out early and would be back soon. As he scannedthe front page of the Jornal do Brasil, the date on the masthead caught his eye: it wasexactly two years since he had met Raul, a meeting that had totally changed his life. Hedrank a cup of coffee, lit a cigarette, glanced through the window from where he couldsee the sun beating down on the pavement below and then went into his bedroom to puton some shorts before going for his usual hour-long walk. He could detect a slight smellof burning and checked the sockets and domestic appliances, but found nothing wrong.And yet the smell was getting stronger. No, it wasn’t the smell of a fuse blowing, it wassomething else, something very familiar. He felt a chill in his stomach as his memorytook him back to the place where he had smelled the same smell now filling the"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"apartment: the morgue in the Santa Casa de Misericórdia that he had visited daily forsome months when collecting data for the obituary page of O Globo. It was the macabresmell of the candles that appeared to be permanently burning in the hospital morgue.The difference was that the odour permeating everything around him now was so strongthat it seemed to be coming from 100, even 1,000, candles all burning at the same time.As he bent down to do up his trainers, he had the impression that the parquet floorwas rising up and coming dangerously close to his face. In fact, his legs hadunexpectedly given way beneath him, as if he were about to faint, throwing his chestforwards. He almost crashed to the ground. When the dizziness intensified, he tried toremember whether he had eaten anything strange, but no, it was nothing like that: hewasn’t feeling nauseous, he was simply caught up in a kind of maelstrom that seemed tobe affecting everything around him. As well as the attacks of giddiness, which came andwent, he realized that the apartment was full of a dark mist, as though the sun hadsuddenly disappeared and the place was being invaded by grey clouds. For a moment, heprayed that he was merely experiencing the moment most feared by drug addicts–a badtrip, provoked by the use of LSD. This, however, was impossible. He hadn’t taken LSDin ages, and he’d never heard of cannabis causing such hellish feelings.He tried to open the door and go outside, but fear paralysed him. It might be worseoutside than in. By now, along with the dizziness and the smoke, he could hearterrifying noises, as though someone or some being were breaking everything aroundhim, and yet everything remained in its place. Terrified and lacking the strength to doanything, he felt his hopes revive when the telephone rang. He prayed to God to let it beEuclydes Lacerda–Frater Zaratustra–who could put an end to his suffering. He pickedup the phone, but almost immediately put it down again when he realized that he wasinvoking God’s name in order to speak to a disciple of the Devil. It was not Euclydes:the person calling was his friend Stella Paula, whom he had also recruited into the OTO.She was sobbing, as terrified as he was, and was calling to ask for help because herapartment was filled with black smoke, a strong smell of decomposition and other vilesmells. Paulo broke down into uncontrollable sobs. He rang off and, remembering whathe usually did when he’d had too much cannabis, he went to the refrigerator and drankseveral glasses of milk, one after the other, and then put his head under the cold-watertap in the bathroom. Nothing happened. The smell of the dead, the smoke and thedizziness continued, as did the noise of things breaking, which was so loud that he hadto cover his ears with his hands to deaden it.It was only then that he began to understand what was happening. Having broken allties with Christianity, he had spent the last few years working with negative energies insearch of something that not even Aleister Crowley had achieved: a meeting with theDevil. What was happening that Saturday morning was what Frater Zaratustra called a‘reflux of magical energies’. All his prayers had been answered. Paulo was face-to-facewith the Devil. He felt like throwing himself out the window, but jumping from the"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"fourth floor might not necessarily kill him, and might do terrible damage and perhapsleave him crippled. Crying like an abandoned baby, his hands shielding his ears and hishead buried between his knees, he recalled fragments of the threats that Father Ruffierhad pronounced from the pulpit of the chapel at St Ignatius College.We are in hell! Here you can see only tears and hear only the grinding of teethcaused by the hatred of some against others.[...] While we cry in pain and remorse the Devil smiles a smile that makesus suffer still more. But the worst punishment, the worst pain, the worstsuffering is that we have no hope. We are here for ever.[...] And the Devil will say: my dear, your suffering hasn’t even begun!That was it: he was in hell–a hell far worse than Father Ruffier had promised and whichhe seemed to be condemned to suffer alone. Yes, how long had this been going on–twohours? three? He had lost all notion of time, and there was still no sign of Gisa. Hadsomething happened to her? In order to stop thinking, he began to count the books in theapartment, and then the records, the pictures, the knives, spoons, forks, plates, pairs ofsocks, underpants...When he reached the end, he started again. He was standing bentover the kitchen sink with his hands full of cutlery when Gisa returned. She was asconfused as he was, shivering with cold, and with her teeth chattering. She asked himwhat was happening, but Paulo didn’t know. She became angry, saying: ‘What do youmean, you don’t know? You know everything!’They clung to each other, knelt down on the kitchen floor and began to cry. Whenhe heard himself confessing to Gisa that he was afraid to die, the ghosts of St IgnatiusCollege again rose up before him. ‘You’re afraid of dying?’ Father Ruffier had bawledat him once in front of his classmates. ‘Well, I’m shamed by your cowardice.’ Gisafound his cowardice equally shameful, especially in a man who, until recently, had beenthe great macho know-it-all, and who had encouraged her to become involved with thecrazy warlocks of the OTO. However, in the midst of that mayhem, Paulo really didn’tcare what that priest or his girlfriend or his parents might think of him. The only thinghe knew was that he didn’t want to die, far less deliver his soul to the Devil.He finally plucked up the courage to whisper in Gisa’s ear: ‘Let’s go and find achurch! Let’s get out of here and go straight to a church!’Gisa, the left-wing militant, couldn’t believe her ears. ‘A church? Why do you needa church, Paulo?’He needed God. He wanted a church so that he could ask God to forgive him forhaving doubted His existence and to put an end to his suffering. He dragged Gisa intothe bathroom, turned on the cold-water tap of the shower and crouched beneath it withher. The evil smell, the grey clouds and the noise continued. Paulo began to recite out"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"loud every prayer he knew–Hail Mary, Our Father, Salve Regina, the Creed–andeventually she joined in. They couldn’t remember how long they stayed there, but thetips of their fingers were blue and wrinkled by the time Paulo got up, ran into the sittingroom and grabbed a copy of the Bible. Back in the shower, he opened it at random andcame upon verse 24, chapter 9, of St Mark’s gospel, which he and Gisa began to repeat,like a mantra, under the showerhead:Lord, I believe! Help thou my unbelief...Lord, I believe! Help thou my unbelief...Lord, I believe! Help thou my unbelief...They repeated these words out loud hundreds, possibly thousands of times. Paulorenounced and forswore, again out loud, any connection with OTO, with Crowley andwith the demons who appeared to have been unleashed that Saturday. When peacereturned, it was dark outside. Paulo felt physically and emotionally drained.Terrified by what they had experienced, the couple did not dare to sleep in theapartment that night. The furniture, books and household objects were all in their usualplaces, as if that emotional earthquake had never taken place, but it seemed best not totake any chances and they went to spend the weekend with Lygia and Pedro in Gávea.Since she had been with Paulo, Gisa had become a regular visitor to the Coelhohousehold and was always made welcome, particularly by Lygia. Gisa’s one defect–inthe eyes of Paulo’s parents–was her political radicalism. During the long Sundaylunches in Gávea when Paulo’s parents, aunts, uncles and grandparents would meet,Gisa would always defend her ideas, even though she knew she was among supportersof Salazar, Franco and the Brazilian military dictatorship. Although everythingindicates that she had gradually distanced herself from the political militancy of herstudent days, her views had not changed. When the couple left on Monday morning,Lygia invited them to a small dinner she was going to hold that evening for her sisterHeloísa, ‘Aunt Helói’. The two took a taxi back to their apartment–for Paulo had stillnot learnt to drive. There were no smells, no mists, no shards of glass, nothing toindicate that two days earlier the place had been the scene of what both were sure hadbeen a battle between Good and Evil. When he chose the clothes he was going to wearafter his shower, Paulo decided that he would no longer be a slave to superstition. Hetook from his wardrobe a pale blue linen shirt with short sleeves and pockets trimmedwith embroidery, which was a present his mother had given him three years earlier andwhich he had never worn. This was because the shirt had been bought on a trip hisparents had made to Asunción, the capital of the neighbouring country whose name,since his imprisonment in Ponta Grossa, he had never again pronounced. In wearing thatshirt from Paraguay he wanted, above all, to prove to himself that he was free of his"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"esoteric tics. He had lunch with Gisa and, at two in the afternoon, went over to Raul’sapartment to accompany him to the Dops.It took more than half an hour to travel the traffic-ridden 15 kilometres thatseparated Jardim de Alah, where Raul lived, and the Dops building in the centre of thecity, and the two men spent the time discussing plans for the launch of their LP Gita. Ayear earlier, when the Krig-Ha, Bandolo! album had been released, the two, at Paulo’ssuggestion, had led a ‘musical march’ through the streets of the commercial area in oldRio, and this had been a great success. This ‘happening’ had garnered them valuableminutes on the TV news as well as articles in newspapers and magazines. For Gita theywanted to do something even more extravagant.Calmly going to an interview with the political police when Brazil still had amilitary dictatorship, without taking with them a lawyer or a representative of therecording company, was not an irresponsible act. Besides being reasonably well known–at least Raul was–neither had any skeletons in the cupboard. Despite Paulo’s arrest inPonta Grossa in 1969 and their skirmishes with the censors, they could not be accusedof any act that might be deemed to show opposition to the dictatorship. Besides, theregime had eradicated all the armed combat groups operating in the country. Six monthsearlier, at the end of 1973, army troops had destroyed the last centres of guerrillaresistance in Araguaia in the south of Pará, leaving a total of sixty-nine dead. Havingannihilated all armed opposition, the repressive machinery was slowly being wounddown. The regime was still committing many crimes and atrocities–and would continueto do so–but on that May Monday morning in 1974, it would not have been consideredutter madness to keep an appointment with the political police, especially since anyallegations of torture and the killing of prisoners were mostly made against theintelligence agencies and other sectors of the army, navy and air force.When the taxi left them at the door of the three-storey building in Rua da Relação,two blocks away from the Philips headquarters, it was three on the dot on 27 May.While Paulo sat on a bench, reading a newspaper, Raul showed the summons to the manat a window and then disappeared off down a corridor. Half an hour later, the musicianreturned. Instead of going over to Paulo, who was getting up ready to leave, he wentover to a public telephone opposite, pretended to dial a number, and began to sing inEnglish: ‘My dear partner, the men want to talk to you, not to me...’When Paulo failed to understand that Raul was trying to alert him to the fact that hemight be in danger, Raul continued tapping his fingers on the telephone and repeating,as though it were a refrain: ‘They want to talk to you, not to me...They want to talk toyou, not to me...’Paulo still didn’t understand. He stood up and asked, smiling: ‘Stop messingaround, Raul. What are you singing?’When he made to leave, a policeman placed a hand on his shoulder and said:‘You’re not going anywhere. You’ve got some explaining to do.’"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Paulo only had time to murmur a rapid ‘Tell my father’ to Raul before being ledaway. He was taken through a labyrinth of poorly lit corridors and across a courtyarduntil they reached a corridor with cells on either side, most of which appeared to beempty and from which emanated a strong smell of urine combined with disinfectant.The man with him stopped in front of one of them, occupied by two young men, shovedhim inside and then turned the key in the lock. Without saying a word to the others,Paulo sat down on the floor, lit a cigarette and, panic-stricken, tried to work out whatcould possibly lie behind this imprisonment.He was still immersed in these thoughts when one of the men, who was youngerthan he, asked: ‘Aren’t you Paulo Coelho?’Startled, he replied: ‘Yes, I am. Why?’‘We’re Children of God. I’m married to Talita. You met her in Amsterdam.’This was true. He recalled that during his trip to Holland, a young Brazilian girl hadcome up to him on seeing the Brazilian flag sewn on to the shoulder of his denim jacket.Like Paulo, the two young men had no idea why they were there. The Children of Godsect, which had been started in California some years earlier, had managed to attracthundreds of followers in Brazil and now faced serious allegations, among which wasthat they encouraged sex with children, even between parents and their own children.The presence of the three in the Dops cells was like a snapshot of the state of politicalrepression in Brazil. The much-feared, violent machine created by the dictatorship toconfront guerrillas was now concerned with hippies, cannabis users and followers ofeccentric sects.It wasn’t until about six in the evening that a plainclothes policeman with a pistolin his belt and holding a cardboard folder in his hand opened the door of the cell andasked: ‘Which one of you is Paulo Coelho de Souza?’Paulo identified himself and was taken to a room on the second floor of thebuilding, where there was only a table and two chairs.The policeman sat on one of them and ordered Paulo to sit in the other. He tookfrom the folder the four-page comic strip that accompanied Krig-Ha, Bandolo! andthrew it down on the table. Then he began a surrealist dialogue with the prisoner.‘What kind of shit is this?’‘It’s the insert that accompanies the album recorded by me and Raul Seixas.’‘What does Krig-Ha, Bandolo! mean?’‘It means “Watch out for the enemy!”’ ‘Enemy? What enemy? The government?What language is it written in?’ ‘No! No, it’s not against the government. The enemyare African lions and it’s written in the language spoken in the kingdom of Pal-U-Don.’Convinced that this skinny, long-haired man was making a fool of him, thepoliceman looked as if he was about to turn nasty, thus obliging Paulo to explaincarefully that it was all a work of fiction inspired by the places, people and language ofthe Tarzan cartoons which were set in an imaginary place in Africa called Pal-U-Don."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The man was still not satisfied. ‘And who wrote this stuff?’‘I did, and my partner, who’s an architect, illustrated it.’‘What’s your partner’s name? I want to interview her too. Where is she now?’Paulo panicked at the thought of involving Gisa in this nightmare, but he knew thatthere was no point in lying; nor was there any reason to lie, since they were bothinnocent. He looked at his watch.‘Her name is Adalgisa Rios. We were invited to supper this evening at my parents’house. She should be there by now.’The policeman gathered up the papers, cigarettes and lighter he had scattered on thetable, got up and ordered the terrified prisoner to follow him, saying: ‘Right, let’s go.Let’s go and find your old lady.’As he was being bundled into a black-and-white van bearing the symbol of the Riode Janeiro Security Police, Paulo felt momentary relief. This meant that he had beenofficially arrested and, in theory at least, was under state protection. Hell meant beingpicked up in unmarked cars with false number plates by plainclothes policemen, menwith no orders and no official mandate, and who had been linked with many cases oftorture and with the disappearance, so far, of 117 political prisoners.His parents could hardly believe it when they saw their son get out of the car,surrounded by four armed men. They said that Gisa had not yet arrived and wanted toknow what was going on. Paulo tried to calm them down, saying that it was just a minorproblem with Krig-Ha, Bandolo!

Halfway there, Paulo asked if they couldstop at a public telephone, saying that he needed to tell the recording company thatthere were some problems with the record. One of the policemen said ‘No’, but calmedhim by saying that in a few hours he and Gisa would be free. His plan had not worked:in fact, Paulo had been hoping to call home to ask Gisa to get rid of a jar full ofcannabis that was on the bookcase in the sitting room. He sat frozen and silent until theyreached the door of the building where he lived. A policeman stayed with the van whilethe other three went upstairs with him, crowding into the small, slow lift which on thatoccasion seemed to take about an hour to arrive at the fourth floor. Inside, wearing anIndian sari, Gisa was just turning out the lights, ready to leave, when Paulo came in withthe policemen.‘Sweetheart, these men are from the Dops and they need some information aboutthe record I made with Raul and about the comic strip you and I did for Philips.’Gisa was a bit frightened, but she seemed to take the matter calmly enough: ‘Fine.Tell me what you want. What do you want to know?’A policeman said that it didn’t work that way: ‘We can only take statements at theDops headquarters, so we’ll have to go back there.’She didn’t understand. ‘Do you mean we’re being arrested?’The policeman answered politely: ‘No. You’re being detained so that you canprovide us with some further information and then you’ll be released. But before weleave, we’ll just take a quick look around the apartment.’Paulo’s heart was beating so fast he thought he’d have a heart attack: they were sureto find the cannabis. Standing in the middle of the room with his arm around Gisa’sshoulder, he followed the movements of the policemen with his eyes. One of them tooka pile of about a hundred Krig-Ha, Bandolo! comic strips, while another rummagedthrough drawers and cupboards, and the third, who seemed to be the leader, scrutinizedthe books and records. When he saw a Chinese lacquered jar the size of a sweet tin, hepicked it up, took off the lid and saw that it was full to the brim with cannabis. Hesniffed the contents as though savouring a fine perfume, put the lid back on and restoredit to its original place. It was only then that Paulo realized that the situation wasinfinitely worse than he had supposed: if the policeman was prepared to overlook a jarof cannabis, it was because he was suspected of far graver crimes. The Ponta Grossaincident came to mind: could it be that he was once again being confused with aterrorist or a bank robber?It was only when they arrived at the Dops headquarters that he and Gisa realizedthat they would not be dining with his parents that evening.

Duringthe night of the twenty-eighth they were both photographed and identified andfingerprinted for the police files that had been created in their names; Paulo’s numberwas 13720 and Gisa’s 13721. They were then interrogated separately for several hours.Among the personal items confiscated along with their clothes were their watches,which meant that they lost all idea of time, particularly in the circumstances in whichthey found themselves–imprisoned in a place where there was no natural light.The interrogation did not involve any physical torture and mainly had to do with thepsychedelic comic strip that accompanied the Krig-Ha, Bandolo! LP and what exactlywas meant by Sociedade Alternativa. This, of course, was after they had spent hoursdictating to clerks what in the jargon of the Brazilian police is called the capivara–acareful, detailed history of a prisoner’s activities up to that date. When Paulo said thathe had been in Santiago in May 1970 with Vera Richter the police pressed him forinformation on Brazilians who lived there, but he had nothing to tell them, for thesimple reason that he’d had no contact with any Brazilian exiled in Chile or anywhereelse. Gisa, for her part, had a problem convincing her interrogators that the title of Krig-Ha, Bandolo! had come up during a brainstorming session at Philips when Paulo,standing on a table, had bellowed out Tarzan’s war cry.In Gávea, the Coelhos were frantic with worry. With the help of a friend, thesecretary of the governor of what was then the state of Guanabara, the journalist andbusinessman Antônio de Pádua Chagas Freitas, Lygia managed to find out, toeveryone’s relief, that her son had been arrested by the Dops and was being detained intheir prison in Rua da Relação. This was some guarantee, however flimsy, that he wouldnot join the list of the ‘disappeared’. Since habeas corpus no longer existed, all theycould do was to try to find people who might have some kind of link, either family orpersonal, with influential individuals in the security forces. Paulo’s brother-in-law,Marcos, suggested seeking the help of a friend, Colonel Imbassahy, who hadconnections with the SNI (Brazil’s National Intelligence Service), but Pedro decided totry legal routes first, however fragile these might be. It was Aunt Helói who suggestedthe name of the lawyer Antônio Cláudio Vieira, who had worked in the offices of ‘UncleCandinho’, as the Coelho family called the ex-procurator general of the Republic,Cândido de Oliveira Neto, who had died a year earlier.By five in the afternoon, they were all at the door of the prison. When he was toldthat only the lawyer, Vieira, could enter, Pedro mentioned that he knew one of the starsof the dictatorship. ‘We’re friends of Colonel Jarbas Passarinho.’ He was speaking ofthe ex-governor of Pará, who had held ministerial positions in three militarygovernments (he had been one of the signatories of the AI-5) and had been re-electedsenator for Arena, a party that supported the regime. The policeman was unimpressed,saying that even someone in Jarbas’s position had no influence in Dops.While the lawyer was trying to get news about Paulo from the officer on duty,"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"While the lawyer was trying to get news about Paulo from the officer on duty,Pedro, Lygia, Sônia and her husband Marcos had to wait on the pavement in the drizzle.After some minutes, Vieira came out with good news: ‘Paulo is here and should bereleased today. The officer in charge is phoning his superior to see whether they willallow me to see him for a few minutes.’The lawyer was summoned by the doorman and taken to a room where he would beallowed to speak to Paulo briefly. He was shocked by Paulo’s appearance: while hehadn’t been the victim of any physical violence, Paulo was very pale with dark ringsunder his eyes and had a strange zombie-like expression on his face. Vieira reassuredhim, saying he had been given a promise that he would be freed in the next few hours.And that was that. Lygia insisted that they remain on the pavement outside the Dopsuntil her son was released, but the lawyer dissuaded her from this idea.At about ten o’clock on the Tuesday night, one of the policemen, who had alwaysseemed to Paulo to be the most sympathetic and least threatening, opened the cell doorand gave him back the clothes and documents he’d had with him when he was arrested:he and Gisa were free to go. Paulo dressed quickly and met Gisa in the lobby, and thepoliceman accompanied the couple to the café next to the Dops, where they smoked acigarette.Anxious to get away from such a terrifying place, Paulo hailed a taxi and asked thedriver to take them to his parents’ house in Gávea. The driver set off; then, as the cabwas travelling at speed past Hotel Glória, it was brought screeching to a halt by three orfour civilian vehicles, among them two Chevrolet Veraneio estate cars, which at thetime were the trademark vehicle used by the security police. Several men in plainclothes jumped out and opened the two rear doors of the taxi in which the couple weretravelling and dragged Paulo and Gisa out by force. As Paulo was handcuffed anddragged along on his stomach across the grass, he caught sight of Gisa being throwninto an estate car, which drove off, tyres squealing. The last thing he saw before hishead was covered in a black hood was the elegant white building of the Hotel Glória, litup like fairyland.Once in the back seat of the car, Paulo managed to murmur a question to one of themen with him: ‘Are you going to kill me?’The agent realized how terrified he was and said. ‘Don’t worry. No one’s going tokill you. We’re just going to interrogate you.’His fear remained undiminished. His hands shaking, Paulo was able to overcomehis fear and shame enough to ask his captor: ‘Can I hold on to your leg?’The man seemed to find this unusual request amusing. ‘Of course you can. Anddon’t worry, we’re not going to kill you.’"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17Paulo renounces the DevilIT WAS NOT UNTIL THIRTY YEARS LATER, with the country’s return to democracy, thatPaulo learned he had been kidnapped by a commando group of the DOI-Codi(Department of Information Operations–Centre for Internal Defence Operations). PedroQueima Coelho was concerned about the damage all this might inflict on his son’sfragile emotional state and made a point of being at home so that he would be there toreceive Paulo when he was freed. He spent a sleepless night beside a silent telephoneand at eight in the morning took a taxi to the Dops. When he arrived, he was astonishedto be told by the officer at the desk:‘Your son and his girlfriend were freed at ten o’clock last night.’When Paulo’s father stared at him in disbelief, the agent opened a file and showedhim two stamped sheets of paper. ‘This is the document for release and here are theirsignatures,’ he said, trying to appear sympathetic. ‘He was definitely released. If yourson hasn’t come home, it’s probably because he’s decided to go underground.’The nightmare had begun. Paulo and Gisa had been added to the list of the regime’s‘disappeared’. This meant that whatever might happen to them, it was no longer theresponsibility of the state, since both had been released safe and sound after signing anofficial release document.What happened after their kidnapping is still so swathed in mystery that in 2007,when he turned sixty, the author still had many unanswered questions. Records kept bythe security police confirm that Raul was not detained and that on 27 May the Dopsarrested the couple, having identified and questioned them during the night andthroughout the day of the twenty-eighth. Documents from the army also show thatfollowing their kidnapping outside the Hotel Glória, Paulo and Gisa were takenseparately to the 1st Battalion of the Military Police in Rua Barão de Mesquita, in thenorth of Rio, where the DOI-Codi had its offices, although there is no information abouthow long they were held at the barracks. Some family members state, albeit not withany certainty, that he could have spent ‘up to ten days’ in the DOI-Codi, but on Friday,31 May, Paulo was in Gávea writing the first entry in his diary following his release:‘I’m staying at my parents’ house. I’m even afraid of writing about what happened tome. It was one of the worst experiences of my life–imprisoned unjustly yet again. Butmy fears will be overcome by faith and my hatred will be conquered by love. Frominsecurity will come confidence in myself.’However, among the documents taken from the archives of Abin, the Brazilian"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Intelligence Agency (the successor to the SNI, the National Intelligence Service), is along interrogation with Paulo lasting from eleven o’clock on the night of 14 June untilfour in the morning of 15 June in the offices of the DOI-Codi. The mystery lies in thefact that he swears that he never returned to the DOI-Codi following his release. Thelawyer Antônio Cláudio Vieira also states with equal certainty that he neveraccompanied him to Rua Barão de Mesquita; nor was he called a second time by theCoelho family to help their son. The same version is corroborated by Pedro, Paulo’ssister Sônia Maria and her ex-husband, Marcos, who witnessed everything at closehand. Any suspicion that Paulo, in his terror, had betrayed his friends or put others indanger and now wanted to remove this stain from his record does not stand up to areading of the seven pages typed on the headed notepaper of the then 1st Army. Thefirst four pages are filled with a reiteration of the statement that Paulo had made in theDops, a detailed history of his life up until then: schools, work in the theatre, tripswithin Brazil and abroad, prison in Paraná, O Globo, the course in Mato Grosso, APomba, his partnership with Raul...The part referring to his and Raul’s membership ofthe OTO is so incomprehensible that the clerk had to write ‘sic’ several times, just tomake it clear that this really was what the prisoner had said:That in 1973 the deponent and Raul Seixas had concluded ‘that the world isexperiencing an intense period of tedium’ [sic]; that on the other hand theyrealized that the career of a singer, when not accompanied by a strongmovement, tends to end quickly. That the deponent and Raul Seixas thenresolved ‘to capitalize on the end of hippiedom and the sudden interest inmagic around the world’ [sic]; that the deponent began to study the books of anesoteric movement called ‘OTO’. That the deponent and Raul Seixas thendecided to found the ‘Sociedade Alternativa’, ‘which was registered at theregister office to avoid any false interpretations’ [sic]; that the deponent andRaul Seixas were in Brasília and explained the precepts of the SociedadeAlternativa to the chiefs of the Federal Police and the Censors, stating ‘that theintention was not to act against the government, but to interest youth in anotherform of activity’ [sic].When the police asked him to give the names of people he knew with left-wingtendencies, Paulo could recall only two: someone who used to go to the Paissandu,‘known by everyone as the Philosopher’, and an ex-boyfriend of Gisa’s in the studentmovement, whose name he also could not remember, but which he believed ‘began withthe letter H or A’. The certainty with which everyone states that he did not return to theDOI-Codi after being kidnapped is corroborated by his diary, in which there isabsolutely no record of his making a further statement on the night of 14–15 June. The"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"theory that the clerk had typed the wrong date doesn’t hold up when one considers thefact that the statement is seven pages long, with the date–14 June–typed on every page.The definitive proof that Paulo was indeed at the DOI-Codi on some date after 27 May,however, is to be found in one small detail: when he was photographed and identified inthe Dops some hours after his arrest on 27 May, he had a moustache and goatee beard.On 14 June, he is described as having ‘beard and moustache shaven off’.As for Gisa, during the time in which she remained in the DOI-Codi she underwenttwo interrogations. The first started at eight on the morning of 29 May and only endedat four in the afternoon, and the second was held between eight and eleven on themorning of the following day, Thursday. On both occasions, she was treated as amilitant member of the radical group Ação Popular (Popular Action) and of theBrazilian Communist Party, but, as in Paulo’s case, she had little or nothing to tellthem, apart from her work in the student movement when she was involved in severalleft-wing organizations.During one of the nights when they were being held in the DOI, somethinghappened that caused the final break between the two. With his head covered by a hood,Paulo was being taken to the toilet by a policeman when, as he walked past a cell, heheard someone sobbing and calling him: ‘Paulo? Are you there? If it’s you, talk to me!’It was Gisa, probably also with a hood on her head: she had recognized his voice.Terrified at the thought that he might be placed naked in the ‘refrigerator’–the closedcell where the temperature was kept deliberately low–he stayed silent.His girlfriend begged for his help: ‘Paulo, my love! Please, say yes. Just that, saythat it’s you!’Nothing.She went on: ‘Please, Paulo, tell them I’ve got nothing to do with all this.’In what he was to see as his greatest act of cowardice, he didn’t even open hismouth.One afternoon that week, probably Friday, 31 May, a guard appeared with hisclothes, told him to get dressed and to cover his head with the hood. He was put on therear seat of a car and, having been driven some way, thrown out in a small square inTijuca, a middle-class district 10 kilometres from the barracks where he had been held.The first days in his parents’ house were terrifying. Every time someone knockedon the door, or the telephone rang, Paulo would lock himself in his room, afraid ofbeing taken away again by the police, the military or whoever it was who had kidnappedhim. In order to calm him a little, Pedro, touched by his son’s paranoia, had to swearthat he would not allow him to be imprisoned again, whatever the consequences. ‘Ifanyone comes to take you without a legal summons,’ he promised, ‘he’ll be greetedwith a bullet.’ Only after two weeks holed up in Gávea did Paulo have the courage to goout in the street again, and even then he chose a day when it would be easy to spot ifsomeone was following him: Thursday, 13 June, when Brazil and Yugoslavia were"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"playing the first match of the 1974 World Cup in Germany, and the whole countrywould be in front of the television supporting the national team. With Rio transformedinto a ghost town he went by bus to Flamengo and then, after much hesitation, heplucked up the courage to go into the apartment where he and Gisa had lived until theSaturday on which they believed they had received a visit from the Devil. It was exactlyas the police had left it on the Monday evening after searching it. Before the refereeblew the final whistle of the match, Paulo was back in the shelter of his parents’ home.One of the penances he imposed on himself, though, so that everything would return tonormal as quickly as possible, was not to watch any of the World Cup matches.The most difficult thing was finding Gisa. Since that dreadful encounter in the DOI-Codi prison he had had no more news of his girlfriend, but her voice crying ‘Paulo! Talkto me, Paulo!’ kept ringing in his head. When he eventually managed to call her oldapartment, where she had gone back to live, it suddenly occurred to him that the phonemight be tapped and so he didn’t dare to ask whether she had been tortured or when shehad been released. When he suggested a meeting in order to discuss their future, Gisawas adamant: ‘I don’t want to live with you again, I don’t want you to say another wordto me and I would prefer it if you never spoke my name again.’Following this, Paulo fell into such a deep depression that his family again soughthelp from Dr Benjamim Gomes, the psychiatrist at the Dr Eiras clinic. Luckily forPaulo, this time the doctor decided to replace electric shocks with daily sessions ofanalysis, which, during the first weeks, were held at his home. Paulo’s persecutionmania had become so extreme that, on one outing, he became so frightened that hefainted in the street in front of a bookshop in Copacabana and was helped by passers-by.When Philips sent him the proofs for the record sleeve for Gita, which was about to bereleased, he couldn’t believe his eyes: it was a photo of Raul with a Che Guevara beretbearing the red five-pointed star of the communists. Appalled, he immediately phonedPhilips and demanded that they change the image; if they didn’t, he would not allow anyof his songs to appear on the record.When they asked why, he replied so slowly that he seemed to be spelling out eachword: ‘Because I don’t want to be arrested again and with that photo on the recordsleeve, they’ll arrest me again. Understood?’After much discussion, he accepted that Raul could be shown wearing the Cheberet, but he demanded a written statement from Philips stating that the choice was theentire responsibility of the company. In the end, a suggestion by a graphic artist won theday: the red star was simply removed from the photo, so that it looked as though theberet was merely an innocent beret with no sinister communist connotations.Since Gisa refused to answer his calls, Paulo began to write her letters each day,asking forgiveness for what he had done in the prison and suggesting that they livetogether again. In one of these letters he wrote of his feelings of insecurity during thethree years they had spent together:"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"I didn’t understand why, when you moved in with me, you brought just the bareminimum of clothes. I never understood why you insisted on continuing to paythe rent on the other empty apartment. I wanted to put pressure on you withmoney, saying I wouldn’t pay any more, but you still kept on the otherapartment. The fact that the other apartment existed made me really insecure. Itmeant that from one moment to the next you could escape my grasp and regainyour freedom.Gisa never replied, but he continued to write. One day, his father, clearly upset, tookhim to one side. ‘Look, Gisa phoned me at the office,’ he told him, his hand on his son’sshoulder. ‘She asked me to tell you not to write to her again.’ Paulo ignored the requestand went on writing: ‘Today my father told me that you don’t want to see me again. Ialso learned that you’re working, which is good, and I felt both hurt and happy. I hadjust heard “Gita” on the radio. I was wondering whether you think of me when you hearthat song. I think they were the most beautiful lyrics I’ve written so far. It contains allof me. Now I don’t read, don’t write and I’ve no friends.’This was one of the symptoms of his paranoia, that all his friends had supposedlyabandoned him for fear of being close to someone who had been seized and imprisonedby the security police. Whether this was real or imagined, what mattered was his beliefthat, apart from Raul, only two people held out a hand to him: the journalist HildegardAngel and Roberto Menescal, one of the creators of the bossa nova and, at the time, adirector of Polygram. Together with Phonogram, Polydor and Elenco, the company wasone of the Brazilian arms of the Dutch multinational Philips, and one of its greatestrivals in Brazil was CBS, a subsidiary of the American company Columbia. Hilde, asshe was and is known, continued to be a friend to Paulo even though she had painfulreasons to avoid risking any more confrontations with the dictatorship: three yearsearlier, her youngest brother, Stuart Angel, who was a member of the guerrilla groupMR-8, had been brutally asphyxiated at an air force barracks, with his mouth pressed tothe exhaust pipe of a moving jeep. His wife, the economist Sônia Moraes Angel, amember of the ALN (National Liberationist Movement), had also died while beingtortured by the DOI-Codi in São Paulo a few months earlier, at the end of 1973. As ifthese two tragedies were not enough for one family, Hilde and Stuart’s mother, thedesigner Zuzu Angel, was to die two years later in a car accident that had all thehallmarks of an assassination attempt and became the subject of the film Zuzu Angel.It was Hilde who, after much insistence, convinced Paulo to get back intocirculation. She invited him to attend the debate ‘Women and Communication’ at whichshe was to participate with the feminist Rose Marie Muraro at the Museu Nacional deBelas-Artes. Paulo’s justified paranoia would have reached unbearable levels had heknown that among the audience was a spy, Deuteronômio Rocha dos Santos, who wrotea report on the meeting for the Section of Special Searches (part of the Dops) in which"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"he said: ‘among those present was the journalist and writer Paulo Coelho, a personalfriend of Hildegard Angel’.As soon as he felt strong enough to go around without fear of being kidnappedagain, Paulo’s first important step after what he referred to as the ‘black week’ was tosearch out the OTO. He had two reasons for going to see Frater Zaratustra: first, hewanted to understand what had happened in his apartment on that dreadful Saturdayand, second, whatever the explanation, he was going to distance himself permanentlyfrom the sect. His fear of the Devil was such that he asked Euclydes-Zaratustra to meethim during the day at his parents’ house, where he had gone back to live, and, for goodmeasure, he invited Roberto Menescal to be there as a witness. This turned out to be agood idea: to his surprise, on the appointed day, who should appear at the house inGávea but Parzival XI, the self-crowned world head of the sect–the sinister and uncouthMarcelo Ramos Motta. Paulo decided to come straight to the point. After summarizingwhat had happened at his home and in prison, he asked: ‘I want to know what happenedto me that Saturday and on the following days.’Parzival XI eyed him scornfully. ‘You always knew that with us what counts is thelaw of the strongest. I taught you that, remember? According to the law of the strongest,whoever holds out succeeds. Those who don’t, fail. That’s it. You were weak andfailed.’Menescal, who was listening to the conversation from a distance, threatened toattack the visitor–something that would have endangered the Coelhos’ china andcrystal, since Menescal practised aikido and the Crowleyite Ramos Motta was a blackbelt in ju-jitsu.But Paulo restrained him and, for the first time, addressed the high priest by his realname: ‘So is that what the OTO is, Marcelo? On Saturday, the Devil appears in myhouse, on Monday, I’m arrested and on Wednesday, I’m abducted? That’s the OTO, isit? Well, in that case, my friend, I’m out of it.’As soon as he found himself free from the sect, it was with great relief, as thoughhe had sloughed off a great burden, that Paulo sat down at his typewriter and wrote anofficial document formalizing his rejection of the mysterious Ordo Templi Orientis. Hisbrief and dramatic incursion into the kingdom of darkness had lasted less than twomonths:Rio de Janeiro, 6 July 1974I, Paulo Coelho de Souza, who signed my declaration as a Probationer in theyear LXX, 19 May, with the sun in the sign of Taurus, 1974 e.v., ask andconsider myself to be excluded from the Order because of my completeincompetence in realizing the tasks given me.I declare that, in taking this decision, I am in a perfect state of physical andmental health."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"93 93 / 93As witness my hand,Paulo CoelhoWhat Paulo believed to be a break with the Devil and his followers did not mean the endof his paranoia. In fact he felt safe only when at home with his parents and with thedoors locked. It was during this period of despair that the idea of leaving Brazil for awhile, at least until the fear subsided, first surfaced. With Gisa out of his life there wasnothing to keep him in Brazil. The sales of Gita had outstripped even the mostoptimistic expectations and the money kept pouring into his bank account.This coincided with another important moment in Paulo’s progress: the launch ofhis first book. Although it was not the Great Work he dreamed of producing, it wasnevertheless a book. It had been published at the end of 1973 by the highly regardedEditora Forense, which specialized in educational books, and was entitled O Teatro naEducação [Theatre in Education]. In it he explained the programme of courses he hadgiven in state schools in Mato Grosso. Not even an admiring review by Gisa publishedon their weekly page in Tribuna had been able to get sales moving: a year after itslaunch, the book had sold only 500 copies out of an initial print run of 3,000. Althoughit was predictable that the work would pass almost unnoticed in the world of letters, thiswas still his first book and therefore deserved to be celebrated. When Gisa had arrivedhome on the day it came out, on the dining table stood two glasses and a miniature ofBenedictine liqueur that Paulo had won at the age of fifteen and kept all that time,promising not to open it until he published his first book.Not even this initial lack of success as an author or the wealth that came with fame,however, could shake the dream that he himself admitted had become an obsession: tobe a writer known throughout the world. Even after he had become well known as alyricist, that dream would return as strongly as ever when he was alone. A rapid flickthrough his diaries reveals, in sentences dotted here and there, that public recognition asa lyricist had not changed his plan one jot: he wanted to be not just another writer but‘world-famous’. He regretted that by the time they were his age, The Beatles ‘hadalready conquered the world’, but Paulo didn’t lose hope that, one day, his dreamswould be realized. ‘I’m like a warrior waiting to make his entrance on the scene,’ hewrote, ‘and my destiny is success. My great talent is to fight for it.’Raul had been very shaken by his friend’s imprisonment, and Paulo had nodifficulty in convincing him, too, to go abroad for a while. Less than ten days after theirdecision to leave Brazil, they were ready for departure. The fact that they had to go tothe Dops to receive a visa to leave the country–a requirement imposed by thedictatorship on anyone wanting to travel abroad–so frightened Paulo that he had aserious asthma attack. But on 14 July 1974, a month and a half after his kidnapping, thetwo partners landed in New York with no fixed return date."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"They each had on their arm a new girlfriend. Raul had separated from Edith, themother of his daughter, Simone, and was living with another American, Gloria Vaquer,the sister of the drummer Jay Vaquer. Abandoned by Gisa, Paulo had started arelationship with the beautiful Maria do Rosário do Nascimento e Silva, a slim brunetteof twenty-three. She was an actress, scriptwriter and film producer. She was also thedaughter of a judge from Minas Gerais, Luiz Gonzaga do Nascimento e Silva, who, aweek before the trip, had been named Minister for Social Services by General ErnestoGeisel, the President of the Republic. Despite her father’s political activities, Rosáriowas a left-wing activist who hid those being persecuted by the regime and who had beenarrested when filming statements by workers at the Central do Brasil railway station inRio. When she met Paulo, through Hilde Angel, she was just emerging from atempestuous three-year marriage to Walter Clark, the then director-general of the Globotelevision network.The bank balance of any of those four travellers was more than enough for them tostay in comfort at the Hotel Plaza opposite Central Park or in the Algonquin, bothnatural staging posts for stars passing through New York. In the crazy 1970s, however,the in thing was to stay in ‘exciting’ places. So it was that Paulo, Rosário, Raul andGloria knocked at the door of the Marlton Hotel, or, to be more precise, on the iron barsthat protected the entrance of the hotel from the street gangs of Greenwich Village.Built in 1900, the Marlton was famous for welcoming anyone, be they pimps,prostitutes, drug-dealers, film stars, jazz musicians or beatniks. Such people as theactors John Barrymore, Geraldine Page and Claire Bloom, the singers Harry Belafonte,Carmen McRae and Miriam Makeba and beat writer Jack Kerouac had stayed in someof its 114 rooms, most of which shared a bathroom on the landing. The fanaticalfeminist Valerie Solanas left one of those rooms in June 1968, armed with a revolver, tocarry out an attack on the pop artist Andy Warhol that nearly killed him. Raul andGloria’s apartment, which had a sitting room, bedroom and bathroom, cost US$300 amonth. Paulo and Rosário had only a bedroom and bathroom, which cost US$200, butthere was no refrigerator, which meant they had to spend their days drinking warm Cokeand neat whisky–this, of course, when they weren’t smoking cannabis or sniffingcocaine, their main pastimes.On 8 August 1974, the eyes of the whole world were turned on the United States.After two years and two months of involvement in the Watergate scandal, RichardNixon’s Republican government was suffering a very public death. The big decisionswere taken in Washington, but the heart of America beat in New York. There seemed tobe a more-than-usual electric atmosphere in the Big Apple. It was expected that at anymoment either the President would be impeached or he would resign. After a nightspent in a fashionable nightclub, Paulo and Rosário woke at three in the afternoon, wentout for a big breakfast at Child, a rough bar a block away from the Marlton, and thenreturned to their room. They had a few lines of cocaine and when they came to, it was"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"getting dark. On the radio on the bedside table, the reporter was announcing that in tenminutes there was to be a national radio and television transmission of anannouncement by President Nixon.Paulo jumped off the bed, saying: ‘Come on, Maria! Let’s go down and record thereactions of the people when he announces his resignation.’ He put on a denim jacketbut no shirt and his knee-high riding boots, grabbed his portable recorder–a heavy thingthe size of a telephone directory–filled his pockets with cassette tapes and hung his cinecamera round Rosário’s neck, telling her to hurry: ‘Come on, Maria! We can’t missthis. It’s going to be better than the final of the World Cup!’He turned on the recorder when they got outside and began describing what hecould see, as though making a live radio report:Paulo–Today is 8th August 1974. I am on 8th Street, heading for theShakespeare restaurant. In five minutes’ time the President of the United Statesis going to resign. Right, we’ve arrived. We’re here in the Shakespeare, the TVis on but the broadcast hasn’t started yet...What did you say?Rosário–I said I still think the American people aren’t cold at all. Quite thecontrary!Paulo–It’s like a football match. The TV’s on here in the bar of theShakespeare restaurant. The broadcast hasn’t started yet but there are alreadyloads of people out in the street.Rosário–Everyone’s shouting, can you hear?Paulo–I can!In the crowded restaurant, the two managed to find a place in front of the television thatwas suspended from the ceiling, its volume on maximum. Wearing a navy-blue suit andred tie, Nixon appeared on the screen, looking very sombre. A church-like silence fell inthe bar as he began to read the speech in which he resigned from the most importantposition in the world. For almost fifteen minutes, the people standing around made not asound as Nixon explained the reasons that had led him to this dramatic decision. Hisspeech ended on a sad note: ‘To have served in this office is to have felt a very personalsense of kinship with each and every American. In leaving it, I do so with this prayer:may God’s grace be with you in all the days ahead.’As soon as the speech had ended Paulo was out in the street, closely followed byMaria do Rosário, with the microphone to his mouth like a radio announcer.Paulo–Christ! I was really moved, Rosário, I really was! If one day I have toresign, I hope it’s like that...But look! Nixon has just resigned and there’ssome guy dancing in the corner."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Rosário–Dancing and playing the banjo. This country’s full of madmen!Paulo–My feelings, at this moment, are completely indescribable. We’rewalking along 8th Street.Rosário–The people are really so happy. Oh, it’s just too much!Paulo–They really are! They’re sort of half-surprised, Maria. Really! Thetelevision crews are interviewing people in the streets! This is an historic day!Rosário–There’s a woman crying, a girl crying. She’s genuinely upset.Paulo–It’s a truly fantastic moment, isn’t it? Really, really fantastic!The two returned to the Marlton, feeling very excited. Rosário got out at the third floor,where their apartment was, and Paulo took the lift up to the seventh, because he wantedRaul to listen to the tapes recording the madness that had taken hold of New York thatevening. When he opened the door, without knocking, as was their habit, he found hispartner lying flat out on the sofa, sleeping with his mouth open. On the small table nextto him was a line of cocaine ready to be sniffed, a half-drunk bottle of whisky and a pileof money amounting to about US$5,000 in one hundred dollar bills. For someonecoming from a public celebration as Paulo had, after having been witness to aspontaneous street festival, the shock of seeing his friend lying there, completely out ofit, a victim of drugs and alcohol, was a real wake-up call. He was sad not only to see afriend in that state–a friend whom he had introduced to the world of drugs–but alsobecause he realized that cocaine was leading him down the same path. Paulo had neverconfessed this to anyone, not even to his diary, but he knew he was becoming drug-dependent. He returned to his room in a state of shock. He saw Rosário’s slim bodylying naked on the bed, lit only by the bluish light from the street.He sat shamefaced beside his girlfriend and gently stroked her back as heannounced in a whisper: ‘Today is an historic day for me too. On 8 August 1974, Istopped sniffing cocaine.’"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18CissaTHEIR PLAN TO REMAIN IN NEW YORK for a few months was cut short by an unforeseenincident. One evening, Paulo was trying out an electric can-opener and accidently let thesharp blade slip, catching his right hand. Rosário tried to staunch the flow of blood witha bath towel, and it immediately became a ball of blood. He was taken by ambulance toa first-aid station in Greenwich Village, where he learned that the gadget had sliced thetendon in the third finger of his right hand. He had emergency surgery and ended upwith nine stitches in his finger and had to wear a metal splint for several weeks, whichimmobilized his hand. A few days later, he and Rosário left for Brazil, while Raul andGloria travelled on to Memphis.On his return to Rio, Paulo found that he was strong enough to confront his ghostsand decided to live alone in the apartment where he had lived with Gisa. However, hiscourage was short-lived. On 10 September, after two weeks, he was once again berthedin the secure port of his parents’ house in Gávea. Anxious to free himself of everythingthat might remind him of demons, prisons and abductions, before moving to theirhouse, he sold all his books, records and pictures. When he saw his bare apartment, withnothing on the walls or shelves, he wrote in his diary: ‘I have just freed myself from thepast.’ But it wasn’t going to be that easy. His paranoia, fears and complexes continuedto trouble him. He frequently confessed that he continued to feel guilty even aboutthings that had happened during his childhood, such as having ‘placed my hand on agirl’s private parts’, or even ‘dreaming of doing sinful things with Mama’. But at leastat home it was unlikely that anyone could simply abduct him, with no questions asked.At a time when sexual promiscuity appeared to carry few risks, he recorded in hisdiary the women who came and went in his life without saying anything much aboutthem, apart from some statement as to how well this woman or that had performed inbed. Sometimes he set up meetings with ex-girlfriends, but the truth is that he had stillnot got over the end of his affair with Gisa, to whom he continued to write and fromwhom he never received a reply. When he learned that Vera Richter was back with herex-husband he noted: ‘Today I went into town to resolve my psychological problemwith a few shares in the Bank of Brazil. I was thinking of selling them and giving themoney to Mário in exchange for having possessed Vera for more than a year. In fact itwas Vera who possessed me, but in my muddled head I always thought it was the otherway round.’His partnership with Raul continued to produce impressive results, but the ship of"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"the Sociedade Alternativa was beginning to let in water. Even before the ‘dark night’and Paulo’s imprisonment, disagreements between them and Philips as to the meaningof the Sociedade Alternativa had begun to arise. Everything indicates that Raul had beenserious about creating a new community–a sect, religion or movement–that wouldpractise and spread the commandments of Aleister Crowley, Parzival XI and FraterZaratustra. For the executives of the recording company, however, the SociedadeAlternativa was nothing more than a brand name they could use to boost the sales ofrecords. The president of Philips in Brazil, André Midani, a Syrian who had become aBrazilian national, had created an informal working group to help the company marketits artists better. This dream team, which was coordinated by Midani and the composerRoberto Menescal, consisted of the market researcher Homero Icaza Sánchez, the writerRubem Fonseca and the journalists Artur da Távola, Dorrit Harazim, Nelson Motta,Luis Carlos Maciel, João Luís de Albuquerque and Zuenir Ventura. The group wouldmeet once a week in a suite in some luxury hotel in Rio and spend a whole day therediscussing the profile and work of a particular Philips artist. At the first meeting, theywould simply talk among themselves, and then the following week, they would repeatthe exercise with the artist present. Those taking part were paid well–Zuenir Venturadescribes how for each meeting he would receive ‘four thousand or four million, I can’tremember which, but I know that it was the equivalent of my monthly salary as adirector of the Rio branch of the magazine Visão’.When it was time for Paulo and Raul to face the group, it was Raul who was in thegrip of paranoia. He was sure he was being followed by plainclothes policemen and hadtaken on a bodyguard, the investigator Millen Yunes, from the Leblon policedepartment, who, in his spare time, was to accompany the musician wherever he went.When Paulo told him that Menescal had invited them to be questioned by the selectgroup of intellectuals, Raul declared: ‘It’s a trick on the part of the police! I bet you thepolice have infiltrated the group in order to record what we say. Tell Menescal we’renot going.’Paulo assured his partner that there was no danger, that he knew most of theparticipants and that some were even people who were opposed to the dictatorship;finally he promised that neither Midani nor Menescal would play such a trick. SinceRaul refused to budge, Paulo went alone to the meeting, but because of Raul’s concerns,he placed a tape recorder on the table so that he could give the tapes to his partnerafterwards. Before the discussion began, someone asked Paulo to explain, in his ownwords, what exactly the Sociedade Alternativa was. From what he can remember morethan three decades later, he hadn’t taken any drugs or been smoking cannabis; however,to judge by what he said, which was all captured on tape, you would think he must havetaken something:The Sociedade Alternativa reaches the political level, the social level, the"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"social stratum of a people, you see? Shit, it also reaches the intellectuals in acountry whose people are coming down from a trip, who are being moredemanding...So much so that there was a discussion in São Paulo about themagazine Planeta. I reckon Planeta is going to go bust in a year from nowbecause everyone who reads Planeta is bound to think that Planeta is a stupidmagazine, well, it failed in France, and so they invented Le Nouveau Planète,then Le Nouveau Nouveau Planète, do you see what I mean? They ended upclosing down the magazine. That’s what’s going to happen with all thesepeople who are into macumba. No, no, no! I don’t mean the proletariat, butwhat people call the middle classes. The bourgeoisie who suddenly decided totake an interest, you know. Intellectually, like. Obviously there’s anotheraspect to the question which is the aspect of faith, of you going there andmaking a promise, and getting some advantage, you know, things like that.Right, but in cultural terms there’s going to be a change, right? And the changeis going to come from abroad, just like it always does, do you see what I’msaying? And it’s never going to be filtered through a Brazilian product calledspiritualism. That’s on the spiritual level, of course, because I think on thepolitical level I’ve been clear enough.Clarity was obviously not his strong point, but the working group seemed to be used topeople like him. Paulo paused a second for breath, and then went on:So...there’s going to be this filtering. In my opinion, it’s not filtering, but noone’s ever going to stop getting a buzz out of Satan, because it’s a reallyfascinating subject. It’s a taboo like...like virginity, do you understand? So,when everyone starts talking about Satan, even if you’re afraid of the Devil andhate him, you really want to get into it, do you understand? Because it’saggression, State agression turned against itself, the aggression of repression,right? A series of things turn up inside this scheme and you start to get into it...It’s not a trip that’s going to last very long, it hasn’t even happened yet, theSatan trip. But it’s a phenomenon. It’s the result of aggression, of the samething as free love, of the sexual taboo that the hippies opened up.[...] I haven’t given, like, an overview of the Sociedade Alternativa. I’vejust noted a few things, but I wanted to give an overview of everything that wecreated, a general vision of the thing, right? Anyway, where does Raul Seixasfit in with all this? The Sociedade Alternativa serves Raul Seixas and he’s notgoing to change his mind because we’ve spent two days talking about theSociedade Alternativa and nothing but, right? The Sociedade Alternativa servesRaul Seixas in the sense that Raul Seixas is a catalyst for this type of"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"movement, all right? It’s been judged to be a myth. No one can explain whatthe Sociedade Alternativa is.Do you see what I mean?‘More or less,’ the journalist Artur da Távola replied. Since most of those present hadunderstood none of this nonsense, the problem the group put to Paulo was a simple one:if this was the explanation he and Raul were going to give to the press, then they shouldprepare themselves to see the idea made mincemeat of by the media. Dorrit Harazim,who, at the time, was editor of the international section of the magazine Veja, thoughtthat if they wanted to convince the public that the Sociedade Alternativa was not merelya marketing strategy but some kind of mystical or political movement, then they wouldneed far more objective arguments: ‘First of all, you need to decide whether theSociedade Alternativa is political or metaphysical. With the arguments you put to us, itwill be very hard for you to explain to anyone what the Sociedade Alternativa actuallyis.’This was the first time the working group had reached a unanimous decision aboutanything, and it fell to Artur da Távola to remind them that they risked losing a goldmine: ‘We need to be very careful because we’re pointing out defects in a duo who sellhundreds of thousands of records. We mustn’t forget that Raul and Paulo are already arunaway success.’However, there was another matter bothering the group: Raul and Paulo’s insistenceon telling the press that they had seen flying saucers. They all believed that this wassomething that could affect the commercial standing of the duo, and they suggested thatPaulo tell Raul to stop it. They had good reason to be concerned. Some months earlier,Raul had given a long interview to Pasquim and, inevitably, he was pressed by thejournalists to explain the Sociedade Alternativa and his sightings of flying saucers,giving him the chance to ramble on at will. He explained that it was a society thatwasn’t governed by any truth or any leader, but had arisen ‘like a realization of a newtactic, of a new method’. As his reply was somewhat unclear, he made another attemptto explain what he meant: ‘The Sociedade Alternativa is the fruit of the actualmechanism of the thing,’ he went on, adding that it had already crossed frontiers.‘We’re in constant correspondence with John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who are also partof the Society.’ With no one there to keep a check on him, Raul even made up factsabout things that were public knowledge, such as his first meeting with Paulo. ‘I metPaulo in Barra da Tijuca,’ he told Pasquim. ‘At five in the afternoon, I was theremeditating and he was too, but I didn’t know him then–it was then that we saw theflying saucer.’ One of the interviewers asked whether he could describe the supposedUFO and he said: ‘It was sort of...silver, but with an orange aura round it. It just stoodthere, enormous it was. Paulo came running over to me, I didn’t know him, but he said,“Can you see what I see?” We just sat there and the saucer zigzagged off and vanished.’"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"It was statements like these that made the Philips work group fear that the duo riskedexposing themselves to public ridicule.When the session ended, Paulo took the recorded tapes to his partner. Since theworking group’s comments had not been exactly flattering, instead of telling Raul to hisface what had happened, Paulo preferred to record another tape on arriving home, inwhich he gave Raul his version of the meeting:The working group’s great fear is that the Sociedade Alternativa might workout and that you, Raul–listening to this tape–won’t be up to the challenge.They’re afraid that the Sociedade Alternativa will grow and that when you goto give an interview on what the Sociedade Alternativa is...as Artur da Távolasaid, you’ll talk a lot but won’t explain things. And the press will fall aboutlaughing, will say it’s a farce and your career will go up in smoke. What I meanis, Philips’ main concern is that you’re not up to it. The meeting was extremelytense. There’s one point I really feel they won’t budge on: your inability, Raul,to hold out. You’ll hear that on the tape and I’m talking about it now becausethat’s the impression I got.Another thing that came up was the problem of the flying saucer, witheveryone saying that it’s stupid. They said, for example, that every time yourepeat the story about the flying saucer, the press will just laugh at you. Idecided to stay quiet and not say whether it was true or false. But the workinggroup reckon that the flying saucer story should gradually be abandoned. Ididn’t say as much, but I left it open at least to the working group that wemight deny the story about the flying saucer.Although the idea of the Sociedade Alternativa proved alluring enough to attracthundreds of thousands of record buyers and an unknown number of Devil-worshippersfrom all over Brazil, time would prove the working group right. As time went on, theexpression ‘Sociedade Alternativa’ would be remembered only as the chorus of a songfrom the 1970s.Now, not long after his return from New York with his hand strapped up, and at theheight of the success of Gita (which had been released in their absence), Paulo wasinvited by Menescal to join the working group as a consultant, with the same pay as theother members, which meant an additional US$11,600 per month. Money was floodingin from all sides. When he received the first set of accounts from the recordingcompany for initial sales of Gita, he wondered whether to invest the money in shares orto buy a summer house in Araruama, but finally decided upon an apartment in the busyRua Barata Ribeiro, in Copacabana. At this time, Paulo also wrote three sets oflyrics–‘Cartão Postal’, ‘Esse Tal de Roque Enrow’ and ‘O Toque’–for the LP Fruto"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Proibido, that the singer Rita Lee released at the beginning of 1975, and he alsoproduced film scripts for Maria do Rosário. In between, he acted in the porn movieTangarela, a Tanga de Cristal. In December 1974, the recording company abandonedthe working group, but then, at Menescal’s suggestion, André Midani contracted PauloCoelho to work as a company executive, managing the creative department.His new financial and professional security did not, however, have the effect ofcomforting his tortured soul. Until May 1974, he had just about managed to live withhis feelings of persecution and rejection, but following his imprisonment, theseappeared to reach an unbearable level. Of the 600 pages of his diary written during thetwelve months following his release, more than 400 deal with the fears resulting fromthat black week. In one notebook of 60 pages chosen at random, the word ‘fear’ isrepeated 142 times, ‘problem’ 118 times, and there are dozens of instances of wordssuch as ‘solitude’, ‘despair’, ‘paranoia’ and ‘alienation’. He wrote at the bottom of onepage, quoting Guimarães Rosa: ‘It is not fear, no. It’s just that I’ve lost the will to havecourage.’ In May 1975, on the first anniversary of his release from the DOI-Codi, hepaid for a mass of thanksgiving to be celebrated at the church of St Joseph, hisprotector.Since leaving prison, the person who gave him the greatest sense of security–moreeven than Dr Benjamim and even perhaps his father–was the lawyer Antônio CláudioVieira, whom Paulo considered responsible for his release. As soon as he returned fromthe United States, he asked his father to make an appointment for him to thank Vieirafor his help. When he arrived at the lawyer’s luxurious apartment with its spectacularview of Flamengo, Paulo was completely bowled over by the lawyer’s dark, prettydaughter, Eneida, who was a lawyer like her father and worked in his office. During thatfirst meeting, the two merely flirted, but exactly forty-seven days later, Paulo proposedto Eneida, and she immediately accepted. According to the social values of the time, notonly was he in a position to marry, but he was also a good prospect–someone withenough money to maintain a wife and children. The new album he had made with Raul,Novo Aeon, had been released at the end of 1975. The two had written four of thethirteen tracks (‘Rock do Diabo’, ‘Caminhos I’, ‘Tú És o MDC da Minha Vida’ and ‘AVerdade sobre a Nostalgia’). The record also revealed Raul’s continued involvementwith the satanists of the OTO: the ill-mannered Marcelo Motta had written the lyrics ofno fewer than five of the tracks (‘Tente Outra Vez’, ‘A Maçã’, ‘Eu Sou Egoísta’,‘Peixuxa–O Amiguinho dos Peixes’ and ‘Novo Aeon’). Although Raul and his followersconsidered the record a masterpiece, Novo Aeon was not a patch on the previous albums,and sold only a little over forty thousand copies.Paulo clearly had enough money to start a family, but asking for the girl’s hand soquickly could only be explained by a burning passion, which, however, was not the case.As far as Paulo was concerned, he had not only found a woman he could finally marryand ‘settle down’ with–as he had been promising himself he would do since leaving"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"prison–but he would also have the guarantor of his emotional security, Antônio CláudioVieira, as his father-in-law. On the evening of 16 June 1975, after smoking a joint,Paulo decided that it was time to resolve the matter. He called Eneida, asking her to tellher parents that he was going to formalize his offer of marriage: ‘I just need time to gohome and pick up my parents. Then we’ll come straight over.’His parents were fast asleep, but were hauled out of their beds by their crazy sonwho had suddenly decided to become engaged. Whether it was the effects of thecannabis, or whether it was because he had never before played such a role, the fact isthat when it came to speaking to his future father-in-law, Paulo’s mouth went dry, andhe choked and stammered and was unable to say a single word.Vieira saved the situation by saying: ‘We all know what you want to say. You’reasking for Eneida’s hand in marriage, aren’t you? If so, the answer is “Yes”.’As they all toasted the engagement with champagne, Paulo produced a beautifuldiamond ring that he had bought for his future wife. The following day, Eneidareciprocated Paulo’s present by sending to his house an Olivetti electric typewriter,which the author continued to use until 1992, when he changed to working on acomputer.Not even three weeks had passed before his diary began to reveal that theengagement had perhaps been over-hasty: ‘I have serious problems with myrelationship with Eneida. I chose her for the security and emotional stability that shewould give me. I chose her because I was looking for a counter-balance to my naturallyunbalanced temperament. Now I understand the price I have to pay for this: castration.Castration in my behaviour, castration in my conversation, castration in my madness. Ican’t take it.’To go back on his word and break off the engagement did not even enter his head,because it would mean not only losing the lawyer but gaining an enemy–the merethought of which made his blood run cold. But Paulo realized that Eneida was alsogetting fed up with his strange habits. She didn’t mind if he continued to smokecannabis, but she didn’t want to use it herself, and Paulo was constantly at her to do justthat. As for his ‘sexual propositions’, she made it quite clear: he could forget any ideasof having a ménage à trois. Eneida was not prepared to allow his girlfriends to sharetheir bed. A split was, therefore, inevitable. When the engagement was only forty daysold Paulo recorded in his diary that it had all come to an end:Eneida simply left me. It’s been very difficult, really very difficult. I chose heras a wife and companion, but she couldn’t hack it and suddenly disappearedfrom my life. I’ve tried desperately to get in touch with her mother, but bothher parents have disappeared as well. I’m afraid that she has told her parentsabout my Castaneda-like ideas and my sexual propositions. I know that she toldthem about those. The break-up was really hard for me, much harder than I had"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"imagined. My mother and father are going to be very shocked when they hear.And it’s going to be difficult for them to accept another woman in the way theyaccepted my ex-fiancée. I know that, but what can I do? Go off again andimmediately start looking for another companion.The companion on whom he had his eye was a trainee, Cecília Mac Dowell, who wasworking on the press team at Philips. But before declaring himself to Cissa, as she wasknown, Paulo had a lightning romance with Elisabeth Romero, who was also a journalistand had interviewed him for a music magazine. They started going out together, and theaffair took off. Beth rode a large Kawasaki 900 motorbike, and Paulo took to ridingpillion. Although the affair was short-lived, it allowed Beth to witness an episode whichPaulo was to describe dozens, if not hundreds of times in interviews published in theinternational press: the meeting he never had with his idol Jorge Luis Borges.With the Christmas holidays approaching, Paulo invited Beth to go with him toBuenos Aires, where he intended to visit the great Argentinean writer. He had beenputting off the trip for some time, reluctant to go to the police in order to ask for an exitvisa to travel to the neighbouring country, fearing that he might be arrested again. Theymade no attempt to get in touch with Borges beforehand or to obtain some kind of letterof introduction, but the couple were nevertheless prepared to put up with the forty-eight-hour bus journey between Rio and Buenos Aires, armed only with Borges’saddress: Calle Maipu 900. As soon as they arrived, Paulo went straight there. The porterof the apartment block, in the centre of the city, told him that Don Jorge Luis was on theother side of the road having a coffee in the bar of an old hotel. Paulo crossed the road,went into the lobby and saw through the window the unmistakable silhouette of thegreat author of El Aleph, then seventy-six years old, seated alone at a table, drinking anespresso. Such was his excitement that Paulo didn’t have the courage to go up to him.Creeping out as silently as he had entered, he left without saying a word to Borges–something he would always regret.At the age of twenty-eight, he was to spend his first Christmas away from hisfamily. On the path to Christian reconversion, on 24 December he invited Beth to gowith him to midnight mass. Surprised by her refusal–she preferred to spend the nightwalking through the streets of Buenos Aires–he simply ended the relationship. Hetelephoned Cissa in Rio on the pretext of wishing her a happy Christmas and declared:‘I’m in love with you and I’ll be home in three days’ time. If you promise to meet me atthe airport, I’ll take a plane so we can be together as soon as possible.’Small, like him, with brown eyes and a slightly aquiline nose, Cecília Mac Dowellwas nineteen and doing media studies at university in Rio de Janeiro when she metPaulo. She was the daughter of Patrícia Fait, an American, and the wealthy andrespected TB specialist Afonso Emílio de la Rocque Mac Dowell, the owner of a largeclinic in Jacarepaguá. She had been educated at the traditional Colégio Brasileiro de"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Almeida in Copacabana, which had been set up and run by Nilza Jobim, the mother ofthe composer Tom Jobim. Although she came from a conservative background–herfather came from the northeast and her mother had received a strict Protestanteducation–the Mac Dowells welcomed with open arms the hippie who had fallen in lovewith their youngest child. As the months went by, Patrícia and Afonso Emílio shut theireyes to the fact that Cissa spent every weekend with her boyfriend (who had rented outhis apartment in Voluntários da Pâtria and moved to the two-roomed apartment in noisyBarata Ribeiro). Thirty years later, Cissa would look back and see some ulterior motivesbehind her parents’ broad-mindedness: ‘I think that because my two older sisters hadn’tmarried, my parents lowered their expectations regarding future sons-in-law. Theythought it best not to frighten off any potential candidates.’Whatever her parents’ reasoning, the fact is that at the end of the week, when theMac Dowells went to their country house in Petrópolis, Cissa would put a few clothesand possessions into a cloth bag and set off to the apartment in Barata Ribeiro. Thememory of his disastrous engagement to Eneida, however, continued to trouble Paulowhenever such a situation threatened to reappear: He wrote in his diary: ‘This evening,we’re having supper at Cissa’s house and I hate that because it looks like we’reengaged, and the last thing I want at the moment is to be someone’s fiancé.’ During oneof his sessions with the psychiatrist, which he continued to attend frequently, DrBenjamim Gomes suggested that his nervous tension arose from his problems withsexual relationships: ‘He said that my lack of interest in sex is causing the tension I’mexperiencing. In fact, Cissa is a bit like me: she doesn’t insist that much on having sex.This suited me fine because I wasn’t under any obligation, but now I’m going to use sexas a therapy to relieve tension. Dr Benjamim told me that the curve on the graphproduced by electroshock treatment is the same as for an orgasm or for an epileptic fit.That’s how I discovered sex as therapy.’Although he still avoided any mention of an engagement, in March 1976, when hisgirlfriend returned from a three-week trip to Europe, Paulo proposed marriage. Cissaaccepted with genuine happiness, but she laid down certain conditions: she wanted areal marriage, both in a register office and in church, with a priest, and with the bride inwhite and the groom in jacket and tie. He burst out laughing, telling her that he wouldaccept all her demands in the name of love; ‘besides I really needed to do somethingconventional and there was nothing better than marriage for that’.Before the ceremony Paulo consulted the I Ching several times to discover whetherhe was doing the right thing, and he recorded in his diary his feelings of insecurity:‘Yesterday I was filled with a real dread of marriage and I was terrified. I reactedviolently. We were both feeling a bit suspicious of each other and things turned ugly.’Two days later, his state of mind was quite different: ‘I’ve been sleeping away from theapartment because I’m suffering from paranoia. I’m desperate for Cissa to come andlive with me now. We really do love each other and understand each other and she’s a"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"very easy person to be with. But before she can do that, we have to go through the farceof the wedding.’On 2 July, however, Paulo was even more dressed up than his fiancée haddemanded. Punctually, at seven in the evening, as Chopin’s Nocturne No. 2 was playing,he took his place to the right of the priest in St Joseph’s Church. Compared with thePaulo Coelho who had allowed himself to be photographed drunk and dishevelled inNew York two years earlier, the man at the altar looked like a prince. With short hair,and his moustache and goatee neatly trimmed, he was wearing a modern morning suit,with a double-breasted jacket, striped trousers, black shoes, a white shirt with cufflinksand a silver tie–identical clothes to those worn by his father and father-in-law, althoughnot by his two best men, Roberto Menescal and Raul Seixas.To the sound of Elgar’s ‘Pomp and Circumstance’, five bridesmaids led the way forthe bride, who arrived on her father’s arm and wearing a long white dress. Among thedozens of guests filling the church, Raul Seixas was a most striking figure, in darkglasses, red bowtie and a jacket with matching red stitching. At the blessing of therings, music filled the nave and the ceremony ended to the chords of Albinoni’s Adagio.Afterwards, everyone went back to the bride’s parents’ apartment, where the civilceremony was performed, followed by a magnificent dinner.The honeymoon was nothing special. Since both had to get back to work, they spenta week in a summer house that belonged to Paulo’s parents on the island of Jaguanum,off the Rio de Janeiro coast. Neither has particularly fond memories of that time. Thereis no reference to the trip in Paulo’s diaries, and Cissa commented: ‘Paulo wasn’t veryhappy. I don’t think he wanted all that formality...He agreed to it, but only, I think,because I insisted. But it wasn’t the sort of honeymoon, where you’d say, oh, it wasmarvellous, we were so in love. No. No, I don’t recall that. I know we spent a few daysthere, I can’t say how many, and then went back to our little life in Rio.’Their ‘little life’ was to start with a slight disagreement between husband and wife.Paulo insisted on living in his two-room apartment in Barata Ribeiro, not because it wascheap, but because it was near his parents, who had sold their house in Gávea andmoved to a new apartment in Rua Raimundo Correia, in Copacabana, just a block away.The memories Cissa has of the first months of her marriage are not very encouraging:Living there was dreadful. The only bedroom looked directly out on to RuaBarata Ribeiro, which was incredibly noisy. But he was in his maternal phaseand wanted it so that he could be close to his mother, who lived in the samedistrict. Our apartment would hardly have fitted into a decent-sized livingroom. He had another apartment, but wanted to stay close to his mother. I hadbeen brought up to be a good Protestant, and so I did everything I could for thesake of the marriage and learned to fall asleep to the noise from the street. Wegot married in July, and I think we stayed there for about six months."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"This may not have been one of the most promising starts to a marriage, but the marriagesurvived. Sometimes, however, their fights were very noisy, as in the early hours of 24August, Paulo’s twenty-ninth birthday. Cissa was woken at two in the morning by a loudbang, as if a bomb had gone off in the building. She got up, terrified, and found herhusband in the sitting room with a burnt-out firework in his hand. With the inevitablespliff in the other hand, he had decided to let off some rockets, to the despair of theneighbours. Everything was, of course, recorded on tape:Paulo–It’s 1:59 on 24th August 1976. I’m twenty-nine. I’m going to let off arocket commemorating who I am and I’m going to record the noise [sound ofthe rocket exploding]. Great! Everyone is coming to their windows.Cecília–Paulo!!Paulo–What? Everyone’s awake, the dogs are barking...Cecília–This is absurd!Paulo–What?Cecília–Are you mad?Paulo–It made a fantastic noise! It echoed all over the city! I’m thechampion! [laughing a lot] It’s great that I bought these rockets the other day!It’s great! God, it was fun! [laughing a lot] Fantastic! I think that I’ve reallyfreed myself of a lot of things letting off that rocket!Cecília–Come and sit here with me for a while. I’m frightened.Paulo–Why are you frightened? Have you had a premonition or something?Cecília–No Paulo, it’s because I’ve had a difficult day.Paulo–Ah, thank God for that! Jesus, this has been a real liberation, Cecília.Go on, you let off a rocket and you’ll feel calm too, straight away. Stand here atthe window and let off a rocket.Cecília–No! Anyone hearing the noise will know where it came from.Forget about the rockets. Stay a bit with me, will you?Paulo–[laughing a lot] Oh, this is so cool! Two o’clock in the morning, arocket celebrating my birthday, the stars filling the sky. Oh, thank you, God!I’m going to let off my fireworks across the city! [sound of rockets exploding]Cecília–Paulo! The porters in all the other buildings will see it’s comingfrom here.Cissa was in fact an easy person to live with, but she had a strong character andwouldn’t be forced to do anything against her will. She accepted her husband’s‘Castaneda-inspired ideas’, as Eneida had, and would sometimes even join him insmoking a cannabis joint, but she wouldn’t hear of any marital extravagances, which hecalled ‘sexual propositions’. One day, Paulo woke late in the morning when, as usual,"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Cissa was at work. She had left a piece of paper on the bedside table with a handwrittennote that seemed to burn his fingers as he read it. It said that if her husband had decidedto ‘settle down’, then this certainly hadn’t happened at home.To whom it may concern:I am quite relaxed about the 500 women Paulo has had in the past becausenone of them is a threat. But today I felt really worried about my marriage.When Paulo joked with a secretary that he was going to grab her arse, I thoughtthat was really low-class, but it was much worse when I heard him suggestpaying ‘some guys’ in Cinelândia to join in our sexual relationship. I knew hehad done this before, but I never thought he would suggest something sodisgusting to me, knowing me as Paulo knows me, and knowing what I thinkabout it. So this morning I feel more alone than ever because I know I can’ttalk about it to anyone. The only thing I can see, and what I actually want atthis moment, is to separate from Paulo as soon as possible, as soon as thisstupid society allows it, but I know that it’s going to be a real trauma for meand for my family.They hadn’t even been married for a year and already the marriage was floundering."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19LondonHIS MARRIAGE MIGHT BE FALLING APART, but the same could not be said of Paulo’sprofessional life. In December 1976, Philips released the fifth LP produced by Pauloand Raul, Há Dez Mil Anos Atrás, on which ten of the eleven tracks had lyrics writtenby him. It immediately became a phenomenal success. The album took its title from ‘IWas Born Ten Thousand Years Ago’, a traditional American song of which there wereseveral versions, the most famous of which had been recorded by Elvis Presley fouryears earlier. It was also only the second time that Paulo had dedicated a song toanyone; in this case, the dedication was to his father, Pedro Queima Coelho. It was anunusual way of paying him homage, since the lyrics speak of the differences betweenhimself and his father and are slightly condescending. Although he only admitted ityears later, anyone who knew a little about his family history would realize that the‘Pedro’ of ‘Meu Amigo Pedro’ [‘My Friend Pedro’] was his father:Every time that I touch paradiseOr else burn in hell,I think of you, my poor friend,Who always wears the same suit.Pedro, I remember the old daysWhen we two used to think about the world.Today, I call you square, PedroAnd you call me a bum.Pedro, where you go I go too,But everything ends where it startedAnd I’ve got nothing to say to you,But don’t criticize me for being the way I am,Each one of us is a universe, Pedro,Where you go I go too."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Success was synonymous with money and, as far as Paulo was concerned, money had tobe transformed into bricks and mortar. By the end of 1976, he was the owner of a thirdproperty, a two-bedroom apartment in Rua Paulino Fernandes, in Flamengo, a few stepsfrom the estate where he had been born and brought up. Despite the pleasure he took inbeing a property owner, there was a problem in being rich: the possible envy of otherpeople, particularly communists. In this aspect, Paulo had become very conventionalindeed. The long-haired hippie who, only a short time before, had challenged theconsumer society and written ironical songs about materialism was now terrified oflosing the money he had so eagerly accumulated. ‘Today at the cinema I was gripped bythis terrible fear of communism coming and taking away all my apartments,’ Pauloconfessed to his diary and added bluntly, ‘I would never fight for the people. Thesewords may come back to haunt me, but I would never do that. I fight for free thoughtand perhaps for an elite of privileged people who choose a society apart.’The material stability that the world of music gave him, however, never seems tohave diverted him from his old dream of becoming a great writer. In anxious momentshe got to the point of feeling ‘almost certain’ that he would not achieve this. He wasappalled each time he thought how close his thirtieth birthday was, the deadline he hadgiven himself, and beyond which, he believed, he wouldn’t have the slightest chance ofbeing a literary success. But all it took to restore his enthusiasm was to read that AgathaChristie had accumulated a fortune of US$18 million simply from her book sales. Onthese occasions Paulo would plunge back into his daydreams: ‘There’s no way I want topublish my novels in Brazil. There’s no market for them here. In Brazil, a book thatsells 3,000 copies is deemed a success, while in the United States that would beconsidered a complete flop. There’s no future here. If I want to be a writer I’m going tohave to get out of here.’Meanwhile, Paulo was obliged to submit to the routine of meetings and trips to SãoPaulo demanded by his position as a Philips executive. The company had decided toconcentrate all its departments in one office, in the then remote Barra da Tijuca, amodern district that was just beginning to develop in Rio. He was against the move, notjust because his work would then be 40 kilometres from his home–which meant he hadto get over the trauma of that accident in Araruama, buy a car and take his driving test–but also because he was given a really tiny office. He complained to no one except hisdiary: ‘I’m sitting in my new office, if that’s what you can call the place I’m in now.Me and my team, comprising two secretaries, an assistant and an office boy, occupy anarea of 30 square metres, i.e., 5 metres per person. This would be bad enough if itweren’t for the fact that we also have to take into consideration the pile of obsoletefurniture that has also been crammed into this small space.’As well as the distance and discomfort, he realized that his job was all to do withvanity, prestige and squabbles over space in the media. This world of embattled egosand back-stabbings was hardly the ideal place for someone so tormented by fear and"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"paranoia. If some big shot was less than effusive when he met him in the lift, Paulowould immediately see in this a threat to his job. Not being invited to a show or to somemajor launch in the music world was a guarantee of sleepless nights and page afterdespairing page in his diary. Being excluded from a company meeting could trigger anasthma attack. His insecurity reached extreme levels. A music producer who ignoredhim could provoke an internal crisis that almost prevented him from working. When anumber of these symptoms coincided, Paulo would lose direction entirely.I’m in a really bad way today, completely in the grip of paranoia. I think no onelikes me, that they’re going to play some dirty trick on me at any moment andthat they don’t pay me as much attention as they used to.It all started when I was practically thrown out of a meeting this morning.It left me with a runny nose. Maybe the colds I get are psychosomatic. AndréMidani, the president of the company, came into the room and didn’t evenspeak to me; my partner was in a foul mood, and I’m sure he’s plotting againstme. My name isn’t mentioned in a newspaper column, when it should be.To add to my persecution mania, I wasn’t even invited to the launch ofNelson Motta’s book. He’s pretty much avoided me, and I’ve never been ableto conceal my dislike of him.I think people only tolerate me because I’m a friend of Menescal’s. Itreally winds me up.His dual role–as lyricist and Philips executive–also became a source of irrepressiblefears. Paulo often had to produce lengthy reports for the Philips board containingcritical appraisals of the most important artists contracted to the company, namely, hiscolleagues. Although only Midani, Menescal, Armando Pittigliani and one or two otherdirectors read this information, it made him go cold just to think of that material fallinginto the hands or reaching the ears of the artists he had assessed. His fear wasjustifiable, as he was usually niggardly in his praise and harsh in his criticism. Paulowas nevertheless a more than dedicated worker whose enthusiasm for what he wasdoing often meant working late into the night. His work with Philips was one of thesupports on which his fragile emotional stability was balanced. The second was hissomewhat shaky marriage and the third, a new interest into which he threw himselfbody and soul, yoga. As well as this, and when things got too much, he asked for helpfrom Dr Benjamim Gomes, who would get him back on track with an assortment ofantidepressants.In January 1977, Paulo had been convinced that Cissa was different from hisprevious partners. ‘She is what she is, she’s unlikely to change,’ he wrote. ‘I’ve stoppedtrying to change her because I can see how useless that is.’ Gradually, however, he"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"managed to interest his wife in at least one facet of his world–drugs. Cissa would neverbecome a regular consumer, but it was because of him that she smoked cannabis for thefirst time and then experimented with LSD. Following a ritual similar to that adopted byVera Richter when she smoked hashish for the first time, they had their first experimentwith LSD on 19 March, St Joseph’s feast day, after first kissing the saint’s image. Theyturned on a tape recorder when Cissa placed the small tablet on her tongue and fromthen on she described her initial feelings of insecurity, how she felt, at first, sleepy andthen experienced itching all over her body, finally reaching a state of ecstasy. At thatmoment, she began to hear ‘indescribable’ sounds. Sobbing, she tried unsuccessfully todescribe what she felt: ‘No one can stop what’s going in my ears. I’ll never forget whatI’m hearing now. I need to try and describe it...I know that you heard what I heard. Iwas looking at the ceiling of our little home. I don’t know...I think it’s impossible todescribe it, but I must...Paulo, it’s such an amazing thing.’ Her husband monitored this‘research’ and also provided the sound track. The opening was a headline from JornalNacional, on TV Globo, announcing high numbers of traffic accidents in Rio. Thencame Bach’s Toccata and Fugue, and Wagner’s Wedding March. To calm his guinea pighe promised that should she have a bad trip, a simple glass of freshly squeezed orangejuice would quickly reverse the effects of the lysergic acid.While drugs may have masked his anxieties, they were not enough to drive themaway. It was during one of his deep depressions that a superhero appeared to him in hisroom, on a mission to save him. This was the heavyweight Rocky Balboa, the characterplayed by Sylvester Stallone in the film Rocky. In the early hours, in March 1977, as heand Cissa sat in bed watching the Oscar awards on TV, Paulo was moved to see Rockywin no fewer than three statuettes, for best film, best director and best editing. LikeBalboa, who had come back from nothing to become a champion, he, too, wanted to be awinner and was determined to win his prize. And still the only thing he was interested inbecoming was a writer with a worldwide readership. It was already clear in his mindthat the first step on the long road to literary glory was to leave Brazil and write hisbooks abroad. The following day he went to Menescal and told him he was leaving. If ithad been up to Paulo, the couple’s destination would have been Madrid, but Cissa’spreference won the day and in early May 1977, the two disembarked at Heathrowairport in London, the city chosen as the birthplace of his first book.A few days later, they were settled in a studio flat in 7 Palace Street, halfwaybetween Victoria station and Buckingham Palace, for which they paid £186 a month. Itwas a tiny apartment, but it was in a good location and there was a further attraction: abath. When they arrived in London, they opened an account at the Bank of Brazil withUS$5,000. Money was not exactly a problem for Paulo, but as well as being known forhis parsimony, he had a legal problem, which was the limit of US$300 a month thatcould be transferred to Brazilians living abroad. In order to get round this, at the end ofeach month Paulo and Cissa mobilized grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins to each"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"send US$300 to Brazilian friends who were resident in London and they would thendeposit the money in the couple’s account in the Bank of Brazil. Thus they receivedabout US$1,500 a month without paying any tax.Paulo’s incomings included payment for a music column he wrote in the weeklymagazine Amiga. Cissa did some journalistic work for the Brazilian section of the BBCand published the occasional short, signed article in the Jornal do Brasil, as well, ofcourse, as doing all housework, since her husband’s contribution in this area was nil.Worse, he refused to allow any frozen food in the house and politely asked his wife tobuy a cookery book. The problem was translating the recipes. The two spent hourstrying to understand a recipe so that she could transform it into a meal. A weekly menulisting each day’s meals was solemnly posted in a prominent place on one of the wallsof the apartment. From these menus it can be seen that they only allowed themselvesmeat once a week, although they made up for this with frequent visits to Indian andThai restaurants.They never lacked for money and what they received was enough to cover theirexpenses, including the classes in yoga, photography and vampirism that Pauloattended, as well as outings, short trips and taking in London’s many cultural highlights.Paulo and Cissa were always first in the queue when something was shown that wouldhave been banned by the censors in Brazil, such as the film State of Siege, directed byCosta-Gavras, which was a denunciation of the dictatorship in Uruguay. Three monthswent by without any real work being done. Paulo wrote: ‘I have worked a maximum twodays a week. That means that, on average, in these three months in Europe I’ve workedless than a month. For someone who wanted to conquer the world, for someone whoarrived full of dreams and desires, two days’ work a week is very little.’As there seemed no way to write the wretched, longed-for book, Paulo tried to fillhis time with productive activity. The classes in vampirism inspired him to write a filmscript, The Vampire of London. He sent it by post to well-known producers, all of whomreplied politely, making it clear that, as far as they were concerned, vampires did notmake good box office. One of them very kindly offered ‘to look at the film when it’sfinished and give you my opinion as to whether or not we are prepared to distribute it’.By July, Paulo and Cissa realized that it would not be easy to find friends inLondon. To compensate for this lack in their lives they had a short visit from hisparents. The exchange of correspondence with Brazil was growing, in the form of lettersor, as Paulo preferred, tapes, whenever there was someone who could take them back toBrazil. Piles and piles of cassette tapes collected in the houses of his parents andfriends, particularly in that of his dearest friend, Roberto Menescal, from whom helearned that Rita Lee had found a new writing partner–which, added to the rejectionsfrom producers and publishers, led to pages of lamentation:My partner has found another writing partner. I’ve been forgotten far more"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"quickly than I imagined: in just three months. In just three months I’ve lost anyimportance I had to cultural life over there. No one’s written to me for severaldays.What’s been going on? What lies behind the mysteries that led me here?The dream I’ve dreamed all my life? Right now I’m close to realizing thatdream and yet I feel as though I’m not ready for it.At the end of 1977, when it was time to renew the six-month contract with theirlandlord, the couple decided to leave the apartment in Palace Street for a cheaper one.They put a five-line advertisement in the classified column of a London newspapersaying: ‘Young professional couple need flat from November 15th, London area withtelephone.’ Days later, they had settled in Bassett Road, in Notting Hill, near Portobello,where Paulo would later set his novel The Witch of Portobello. It was not such a smartaddress as Palace Street, but they were now living in a far larger apartment that was alsobetter and cheaper than the other one.While the course in vampirism didn’t help Paulo become a screenplay writer, itnevertheless left a mark on his life. There he met and fell in love with a charmingtwenty-four-year-old Japanese masseuse, Keiko Saito, who was as interested as he wasin that lugubrious subject. As well as being his colleague on the course, Keiko becamehis companion in handing out pamphlets in the street, one day protesting against themass killings perpetrated by ‘Marshal’ Pol Pot in Cambodia, and another collectingsignatures in favour of the legalization of cannabis in Great Britain. Paulo broached thesubject with Cissa: ‘I’m in love with Keiko and I want to know how you feel about meinviting her to come and live with us.’ On the only occasion when he spoke publiclyabout this episode–an interview in 1992 with the journalist W.F. Padovani, who wasworking for Playboy at the time–Paulo revealed that his wife happily accepted hisproposal:Playboy–And what about your marriage to Cecília Mac Dowell?Paulo–It took place in church.Playboy–With the full regalia?Paulo–Yes, and Raul Seixas was my best man. Cecília and I then went to live inLondon, where we enjoyed a ménage à trois.Playboy–How did that happen?Paulo–I did a course on vampires and fell in love with one of the students, aJapanese girl called Keiko. Since I loved Cecília too, I decided to live withthem both.Playboy–Did they meet?Paulo–Oh, yes, we lived together for a year."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Playboy–And how was it in bed?Paulo–I had sex with them both at the same time, but they didn’t have sex witheach other.Playboy–Wasn’t one jealous of the other?Paulo–No, never.Playboy–Wasn’t there a time when you felt you wanted to make love just toone of them alone?Paulo–As far as I can remember, no. It was a very intense love affair à trois.Playboy–Cecília and Keiko didn’t have sex, but what exactly did they feel foreach other?Paulo–They were very fond of each other. They knew how much I loved themand I knew how much they loved me.Just as the Chinese and Soviet communist leaders used to do with political dissenters inofficial photos, Paulo airbrushed from the scene described in Playboy an importantcharacter in this story, a young, long-haired Brazilian music producer known asPeninha, who was also living in London at the time. Paulo had always believed thatCissa was an easy person to live with, but after living with her for a year he had learnedthat he had married a woman who would not put up with any excesses. When sherealized that he was suggesting living with two women, like an Arabian sheikh, in anapartment that had just one room and one bed, he was astonished at her reaction:‘Keiko can come and live here, as long as you agree that Peninha can move in too,because I’m in love with him as well.’Paulo had no alternative but to agree to the involvement of this fourth member ofwhat he came to call ‘the extended family’, or the ‘UN General Assembly’. Whenever arelative of Cissa’s or Paulo’s arrived, Keiko and Peninha had to vanish, as, for example,when Gail, Cissa’s elder sister, spent a week at the apartment.To celebrate the New Year–the first and only one they spent in England–theCoelhos travelled by train with the ‘extended family’ to spend a few days in Edinburgh.The end of the year was always a time for Paulo to weigh up triumphs and failures. Heclearly wasn’t going to lay his hands on the imaginary Oscar that had been one of hisreasons for leaving Brazil in March. Months and months had passed without hisproducing a single line of the much dreamed-of book. Defeat followed defeat, as heconfessed to his diary:It’s been a time of rejections. Everything I’ve submitted to the variouscompetitions I was eligible to enter has been rejected. The last remainingresults arrived today. All the women I’ve wanted to go out with have rejectedme. This isn’t just my imagination. When I say ‘all’ I mean that there is not"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"one exception.[...] Ever since I was a child I’ve dreamed of being a writer, of goingabroad to write and becoming world-famous. Obviously London was the step Idreamed of taking when I was a child. The fact is that the results haven’t beenwhat I was hoping for. My first and greatest disappointment has been withmyself. I’ve had six months here to feel inspired and I haven’t had enoughdiscipline to write a single line.The image Paulo gave to other people was of a successful lyricist whose hobby waswriting about London for Brazilian magazines. His old friend Menescal, however, withwhom he corresponded frequently, began to suspect that his protégé was not very happyand thought that it was time for him to end his stay in London. Paulo agreed to return toBrazil, but he didn’t want to return with his tail between his legs, as though defeated. IfPhilips invited him to go back to work there, he would return to Rio de Janeiro the nextday. Menescal not only flew to London to make the offer but took with him HelenoOliveira, a top executive of the multinational company. The job would not begin untilMarch 1978, but it was the invitation Paulo needed, not the job. The day before leaving,he collected together the few pieces of writing he had managed to produce during thosesterile months in London and put them in an envelope on which, after sealing it, hewrote his own name and address. Then, as he was drinking a whisky with Menescal in amodest pub in the Portobello Road, he ‘accidentally’ left the envelope on the bar. On hislast night in the city, he explained to his diary the reason for this act: ‘I’ve lefteverything I’ve written this year in that bar. It’s the last chance for someone to discoverme and say: this guy’s brilliant. So there’s my name and address. If they want to, theycan find me.’Either the package was lost or whoever found it did not consider its contentsparticularly brilliant. The couple returned to Brazil in February 1978. During the flight,Cissa broke down in tears and Paulo summarized the situation thus: ‘In London all myhopes of becoming a world-famous writer were dashed.’As various of the characters he created later on would say: this was just anotherdefeat, not a failure. He and Cissa returned to the apartment in Rua Barata Ribeiro,which had seemed unsuitable even before their trip to England. As soon as they wereback, Paulo began to predict dark times for his marriage, if the ‘emotional flexibility’that had prevailed in London did not extend to Brazil:My relationship with Cissa could prove lasting if she showed the sameemotional flexibility that existed in London. We have already advanced farenough for a small step back to be acceptable. On the other hand, there will beno opportunities. It is just going to be a question of time. Let’s hope that"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"everything turns out all right. Although I think that our return to Brazil meansthat we’re more likely to split up than to stay together, because here we’re lessforgiving of each other’s weaknesses.Some months later, they moved to the fourth property that Paulo had added to his smallurban portfolio. Bought with the royalties that had accumulated during his absence, thiswas a comfortable three-bedroom apartment in Rua Senador Eusébio in Flamengo, twoblocks from the Paissandu cinema, three from the home of his ex-fiancée Eneida and afew metres from where Raul Seixas lived. They decorated half the sitting-room wallwith photos and souvenirs of their trip to London, which began to take on anothermeaning: while on the one hand, they reminded the couple of the happy times they hadspent there, on the other, they were, for Paulo, a permanent reminder that he had notsucceeded in writing ‘the book’.In March he took up his job as artistic producer with Philips and during the monthsthat followed, he resumed his routine as executive at a recording company. Since hedisliked getting up early, he was frequently woken at ten in the morning with atelephone call from his secretary, telling him that someone had been asking for him. Hewould drive from home to Barra da Tijuca in his own car and spend the rest of the dayin endless meetings, many out of the office, with artists, directors of the company andjournalists from the music world. In his office he ended up dealing with everything. Inbetween fielding numerous telephone calls, he would sort out administrative matters,approve record sleeves and write letters to fans on behalf of famous artists.The fact that Raul Seixas was near by didn’t mean that the partners became closeagain. Indeed, at the end of the year, the two ‘close enemies’ were invited by WEA,Raul’s new recording company, to try to recreate the partnership that had taken Brazilby storm, but the attempt failed. The LP Mata Virgem, for which Paulo wrote five lyrics(‘Judas’, ‘As Profecias’, ‘Tá na Hora’, ‘Conserve seu Medo’ and ‘Magia de Amor’),was released at the beginning of 1979, but did not achieve even a tenth of the sales ofsuch albums as Gita and Há Dez Mil Anos Atrás.The fame that the two had experienced between 1973 and 1975 became a thing ofthe past, but Paulo had absorbed the lesson that Raul had taught him–‘Writing music islike writing a story in twenty lines that someone can listen to ten times without gettingbored’–and was no longer dependent on his partner. Besides the five songs he wrote forMata Virgem, in 1978 he wrote almost twenty songs in partnership with all theperformers who were making a mark on the popular Brazilian music of the time. He hadbecome a sort of jack-of-all-trades in show business, writing songs, directing andscripting shows, and when Pedro Rovai, a director of porn films, decided to makeAmante Latino, he invited Paulo to write the script for that.As was usually the case with his fragile emotional state, when his work was goingwell, his emotional life wasn’t–and vice versa. This time was no different. The clear"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"skies he was enjoying professionally clouded over when he returned home. Thebitterness between him and Cissa gave way to ever more frequent arguments, and thencame the endless silences that could last for days. In February 1979, he decided to goalone on a boat trip to Patagonia. When the liner anchored in Buenos Aires on the wayback to Brazil, he phoned Cissa and suggested that they separate. Given how concernedhe was with signs, it’s surprising that he failed to realize that, three years earlier, he hadproposed marriage to her by telephone and from Buenos Aires.The separation took place on 24 March 1979, when Cissa left the apartment in RuaSenador Eusébio, and it was legally ratified on 11 June in a family court 50 metres fromSt Joseph’s Church, where they had married. The hearing nearly didn’t take place.Firstly, because Cissa had to go out at the last minute to buy a skirt, because the judgewould not allow jeans in the court. Then, the lawyer had forgotten a document, whichmeant that they had to bribe an employee in the register office in order to get theircertificate of legal separation.Setting aside their disagreements, the two went out afterwards to have a civilizedlunch in a restaurant. They each had a very different memory of the end of theirmarriage. Paulo wrote: ‘I don’t know how unhappy she is, but she certainly cried a lot. Ididn’t find the procedure in the least traumatic. I left and went back to work in otheroffices, other rooms, other worlds. I had a good dinner and enjoyed it more than I havefor a long time, but that had nothing to do with the separation. It was all down to thecook, who made a really delicious meal.’ Cissa, on the other hand, set down her feelingsin a brief note written in English, which she posted to him. She found fault with him inthe one area where he considered himself to be good–in bed: ‘One of our mainproblems, in my view, was sex. I never understood why you didn’t think about me inbed. I could have been much better if I had felt that you were thinking about mypleasure in bed. But you didn’t. You never thought about it. So I began not to thinkabout your pleasure either.’For someone whose emotional stability was so dependent on a stable relationshipwith a woman who would help him through his psychological storms, the end of themarriage was sure to presage more depression and more melancholy. Not that he lackedfor women–on the contrary. The problem now was that Paulo had got it into his headthat they were sucking out the energy that he should be putting into his career as awriter. ‘I’ve gone out a lot, had sex a lot, but with female vampires,’ he wrote, ‘and Idon’t want that any more.’The person who appears to have been most seriously shaken by the separation washis mother. During Easter she wrote a long letter to her son, typewritten in singlespacing. It does not appear to have been written by ‘a fool’, as Paulo called his mothermore than once. The document reveals someone who had a knowledge ofpsychoanalytical jargon, which was unusual in a non-professional.

So it seemed like a gift from God when he"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"received an invitation in April 1979–not even a month after his separation–to swap hisjob at Philips for that of product manager with their largest competitor, CBS. Includedin the proposal was the prospect of prompt promotion to the post of artistic director.Following a succession of amorous and professional failures–the poor performance ofthe Mata Virgem album, the short-lived engagement to Eneida, the literary sterility inLondon, the end of his marriage–the invitation was a great relief, in large part because itwould put him back in the media world of Rio and São Paulo, a world he hadn’tfrequented for some time. But it also awoke an unfamiliar and unpleasant side to hischaracter: arrogance. Since one of his duties was to reorganize the artistic department,he started by rocking the boat. ‘It’s true, I did behave very arrogantly when I startedwork there,’ he was to recall years later. ‘I went round giving orders and giving the yes-men a really hard time; pure authoritarianism!’ He suspected that money was beingchannelled out of the company and began to refuse to sign notes and invoices aboutwhich there might be any doubt.Unaware that he was digging his own grave, he hired and fired, cut costs and closeddepartments, adding fuel to what was already a bonfire of egos and vanities. Meanwhile,those who had suffered most in his clean-up operation were plotting against him. OneMonday, 13 August 1979, after two months and ten days in the job, he arrived at thecompany late in the morning and, having sent yet more heads rolling, was summoned tothe office of Juan Truden, the president of CBS in Brazil. He was standing waiting forPaulo, smiling, his hand outstretched and with these words on his lips: ‘My friend,you’re fired.’ Nothing more. No ‘Good afternoon’, no ‘Hope it goes well’.The impact was enormous, not simply because of the coldness of the dismissal butbecause he knew that this meant the end of his career as a recording executive. ‘I wasdismissed from the highest post, from the highest position in the profession, and Icouldn’t go back, I couldn’t go back to being what I was at the beginning,’ Paulorecalled years later in a statement at the Museum of Image and Sound in Rio de Janeiro.‘There were only six recording companies in Brazil and all the six positions I mightreally want were occupied.’ Before packing his bags, he wrote a long, angry letter toTruden in which he said that, in view of the lack of structure in the company, ‘CBSartists at the moment enjoy the dubious pleasure of being the most poorly served in theBrazilian market.’ He finished dramatically, using an expression that had remained inthe popular imagination since it had been used by the ex-president Jânio Quadros in hisletter of resignation: ‘And the same hidden forces that are responsible for my dismissalwill one day have to face the truth. For you cannot hide the sun with a sieve, Sr JuanTruden.’His dismissal (‘for incompetence’, as he learned later) was celebrated by the groupof disaffected individuals he had created as manager, and would cause him still morehumiliation. Some days later, at a social function, Paulo met Antônio Coelho Ribeiro,who had just been made president of Philips, the company Coelho had left in order to"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"try his luck with CBS. When he saw him, Ribeiro said, in front of everyone: ‘Youalways were a bluffer.’Ten months later, Antônio Ribeiro, too, got the sack. When he heard the news,Paulo took from a drawer a present he had bought shortly after Ribeiro had publiclyinsulted him. He went to the Ribeiros’ apartment and, when Ribeiro opened the door,Paulo hurriedly explained the reason for his presence there: ‘Do you remember whatyou said to me when I was sacked? Right, now you can repeat those words every day asyou look into your own eyes.’ He unwrapped the object and handed it to Ribeiro. It wasa wall mirror on which he had had the wretched words painted in capitals: ‘YOUALWAYS WERE A BLUFFER.’ Once he had returned the insult, he turned, took the liftand left.It was time for Paulo to heal his wounds. Now that he had been ejected from theworld of show business, his name did not appear again in the press until the end of theyear, when the magazine Fatos&Fotos published an article entitled ‘Vampirology: aScience that Now Has its Own Brazilian Master’. He was the master, presenting himselfas a specialist in the subject, and he announced that he was writing the script for afeature film on vampires, which was, in fact, never made. His unexpected dismissalfrom CBS had caught him unawares, and with the scars from the recent breakdown ofhis marriage still open he was unable to bear the setback alone. In his solitude, his mindoscillated between delusions of grandeur and feelings of persecution, which, at times,he managed to bring together in his diary in one sentence: ‘Every day it seems harder toachieve my great ideal: to be famous and respected, to be the man who wrote the Bookof the Century, the Thought of the Millennium, the History of Humanity.’This seemed to be simply a repeat of what various doctors had diagnosed asparanoid schizophrenia or manic depression. The problem was that it was nearly timefor his traditional end-of-year taking stock and, at thirty-two, he had still not succeededin realizing his dream. There were moments when he seemed to accept being a writerlike any other. ‘Sometimes I think about writing an erotic story, and I know it would getpublished,’ he noted in his diary. ‘Besides which, I could devote myself to that onegenre, which is gaining ground here now that pornographic magazines are beingpublished again. I could think up some really good pseudonym.’ These plans werefollowed by questions he could not answer. Why write erotic books? To earn money?He was already earning money and he still wasn’t happy. In order not to have to acceptthat his problems were caused by no one but himself, he returned to the old story: hehadn’t written before because he was married and Cissa didn’t help. Now it was becausehe was alone and loneliness was preventing him from writing.I carry on with the same plans, which haven’t yet died in me. I can resuscitatethem whenever I want to; all I have to do is find the woman of my life. And Ireally do want to find her soon..."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"[...] I’ve been very, very lonely. I can’t be happy without a woman at myside.[...] I’m tired of searching. I need someone. If I had a woman I could love,I’d be all right.In his misery Paulo seemed to be confirming the popular belief that there’s none soblind as those who will not see, because ‘the woman of his life’ had been right therebefore him for more than ten years without ever receiving from him a smile or even ahandshake. It’s surprising that such a pretty girl–petite, with dark hair, gentle eyes andporcelain skin–had gone unnoticed for such a long time by Paulo, the confirmedwomanizer.Paulo had met Christina Oiticica in 1968, when her uncle, Marcos, asked Sônia,Paulo’s sister, to marry him. At Lygia’s insistence, all the women invited to the formalengagement dinner were to wear long dresses. For the men, including Paulo, who wassporting a great dark mane of hair at the time and appeared to be completely out of it ondrugs during the supper, she demanded dark suits. Christina and Paulo met severaltimes in the years that followed at family gatherings and dinners without either reallynoticing the other. Naturally, one of these celebrations was for the marriage of Cissaand Paulo. When Paulo’s sister took him to Christmas lunch in 1979 at Christina’sparents’ house, she was going out with Vicente, a young millionaire whose inheritanceincluded, among other luxuries, a vast yacht. Destiny, however, had decided that shewas to be the woman Paulo had so longed for. A week later, just as in a fairy tale, thetwo were together for ever."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20ChristinaAFTER HER PRIMARY EDUCATION, Christina had been to Bennett College, a traditionalProtestant establishment, where the Bible stories told during the Religious Knowledgelessons were the only thing that awoke in her a flicker of interest. She consistentlyfailed in all other subjects, which meant that she had to leave the college and go fromschool to school until, like Paulo, she gave up completely. When she was seventeen,however, she was able to take a different educational route that would allow her tocomplete her secondary school studies in less than a year. It was only then that shereturned to Bennett College, which had become a college of higher education, where shestudied art and architecture. And at the end of 1979, when Paulo arrived at her parents’house for Christmas dinner, she was working as an architect.Although they were practising Christians, Christina’s parents were exceptionallyliberal. If she wanted to go to lessons, she went. If she preferred to go to the cinema, noproblem. And as soon as she was old enough, she was allowed to have her boyfriendssleep over at her parents’ house without any objections on their part. Not, however, thatshe had that many boyfriends. Although she was very pretty, Chris was no flirt. She wasa thoughtful girl, who enjoyed reading and, although she was not particularly religious,joined a choir at one of the Protestant churches. On the other hand, she also went to seefilms at the Paissandu, bought clothes at Bibba, the fashion boutique in Ipanema, andconsumed large quantities of whisky at Lama’s. She went out every night and wouldoften not get home until dawn, her legs unsteady. ‘My drug was alcohol,’ she confessedyears later. ‘I simply loved alcohol.’It was growing dark by the time coffee was being served at the end of Christmaslunch in the Oiticica household. Paulo had had his eye on Chris since he arrived and,even though she was going out with someone else, he decided to use his cousin SérgioWeguelin, who was also present, to find out whether or not she was doing anything thatevening. When it was time to leave, he asked his cousin to invite her to go with them tosee Woody Allen’s latest hit, Manhattan. She was taken by surprise and didn’t knowwhat to say. The next thing she knew, she was alone in the cinema with Paulo, notwatching Manhattan, which was sold out, but a re-run of Airport, which had beenreleased almost ten years earlier.Paulo behaved like a true gentleman throughout the film, and didn’t even try tohold Chris’s hand. When they left, they found the square outside the cinema full ofjugglers, fortune-tellers, tarot readers, chiromancers, fire-eaters and, of course, several"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"religious choirs each singing a different hymn. They walked along until they came to afake Indian sitting in front of a wicker basket in which was coiled a terrifying reptile 6metres in length. It was an enormous anaconda, a non-poisonous snake that was,however, capable of asphyxiating an ox or a human, swallowing it whole and spendingweeks digesting the remains of its prey.With a mixture of fear and disgust for the creature the couple went up to the Indian.As naturally as if he were merely asking the time, Paulo said to Chris: ‘If I kiss thesnake on the mouth will you kiss me on the mouth?’She couldn’t believe what she was hearing. ‘Kiss that monster? Are you mad?’When she realized that he was serious, she accepted the dare. ‘Fine: if you kiss thesnake, I’ll kiss you on the mouth.’To her astonishment and to that of the Indian and all the bystanders, Paulo steppedforward, grabbed the head of the snake in both hands and kissed it. Then, in front ofdozens of wide-eyed spectators, he turned, took Chris in his arms and gave her a long,movie-style kiss on the lips, a kiss that was greeted with a round of applause by thosepresent. Paulo got more than a kiss. A few hours later, the two were sleeping together inhis apartment.On the last day of the year–having first consulted the I Ching–he invited her tospend New Year with him in the sixth of the properties he owned, a small, pleasantsummer house he had just bought in the seaside resort of Cabo Frio. The little whitechalet, with red windows and a thatched roof, was exactly the same as the other seventy-four in a condominium called Cabana Clube designed by Renato Menescal, the architectbrother of Paulo’s friend Roberto. On their way there, Paulo told Christina that theprevious night he had dreamed of a voice that kept saying over and over: ‘Don’t spendNew Year’s Eve in the cemetery.’ Since neither could work out what this meant, andsince they had no plans to see in the New Year in a cemetery, the matter was forgotten.Immediately after they arrived in Cabo Frio, they both sensed a strange atmospherein the house, although they were unable to pinpoint what it was. It wasn’t somethingthey could smell or see; it was what Paulo would call negative energy. As night fell,they began to hear noises, but couldn’t work out where they were coming from–itsounded as though some creature, human or animal, was dragging itself through therooms, but apart from the two of them there was no one else there. Feeling bothintrigued and frightened, they went out for dinner.In the restaurant, they told the waiter about these strange occurrences and weregiven an explanation that made their hair stand on end: ‘Are you staying at the CabanaClube? There used to be an Indian cemetery there. When they were building thefoundations, they found the bones of hundreds of Indians, but built the houses on top ofthem anyway. Everyone in Cabo Frio knows that it’s haunted.’So that was what the warning in Paulo’s dream had meant. Paulo and Chris stayedin a hotel that night and didn’t go back to the house until the next morning, and even"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"then, they only went to collect their clothes. A few weeks later, the chalet was sold forthe same US$4,000 it had cost a few months earlier.No ghosts darkened their relationship, however. After breaking up with herboyfriend during the first days of the New Year, Chris moved into Paulo’s apartment,with all her clothes, furniture and personal possessions, including the easel she neededfor her work as an architect. There they began a partnership which, though it has neverbeen formalized, has remained solid ever since.The start of their life together was not easy, though. As preoccupied as Paulo waswith interpreting signs, Chris was most upset to find in the apartment a biography ofCount Dracula open on a Bible lectern. It was not that she had anything againstvampires or vampirologists–she even liked films on the subject–but she was appalledthat a sacred object should be used as a joke, something which she believed wouldattract negative energies into the house. She was so shocked that she went out into thestreet and from the first available public telephone called the Baptist pastor who used tocounsel her and told him what she had seen. They prayed together over the phone and,before returning to the apartment, Chris thought it prudent to go into a church. She onlycalmed down when Paulo explained that his interest in vampirology had absolutelynothing to do with satanism, OTO or Aleister Crowley, saying: ‘The myth of thevampire existed a hundred years before Christ. I haven’t had any contact with anyoneinvolved in the dark arts for years.’In fact, he hadn’t had anything to do with Marcelo Motta’s satanists since 1974, buthe continued to appear publicly here and there as a specialist on the work of AleisterCrowley. Indeed, some months later he wrote a long article on the English occultist inPlaneta, which was illustrated with drawings by Chris. Their relationship went throughfurther rocky times before it finally settled down. Paulo was still racked with doubt:was Chris really the ‘marvellous companion’ he had been waiting for? He feared thatdeep down the two were only together for the same, unspoken reason, what he called‘the paranoiac desire to escape solitude’. However, even while he was saying that hewas afraid of falling in love with her, he broke out in a cold sweat at the thought oflosing her. ‘We had our first serious argument a few days ago, when she refused to go toAraruama with me. Suddenly I was terrified to think how easily I could lose Chris. I dideverything to get her and have her close. I like her, she brings me peace, calm, and I feelthat we can try and build something together.’These ups and downs at the start of their life together did not stop them celebratingtheir partnership unofficially. On 22 June 1980, a dreary Sunday, they blessed theirunion with a lunch for their parents, relatives and a few friends in the apartment wherethey were living. Christina took charge of the hippie-style decorations and on eachinvitation she wrote a psalm or proverb illustrated with a drawing. Chris’s eclecticinterest in religion seems to have helped the couple’s relationship. When they met, shewas already a specialist in tarot, on which she had read numerous books, and, even"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"though she didn’t consult the I Ching as often as Paulo, she knew how to interpret itspredictions. When Paulo read The Book of Mediums by Allan Kardec, the coupledecided to see if they could be mediums. Just as Cissa had been a guinea pig in theexperiment with LSD, now Paulo was trying to get Chris to write down messages fromthe Beyond. He wrote: ‘I have performed a few experiments. We began last week, whenI bought the book. Chris has acted as a medium, and we have achieved some elementarycommunications. I’ve found this all very troubling. My concept of things has changedradically since I arrived scientifically at the conclusion that spirits do exist. They existand are all around us.’ Much later, Chris confirmed that the experiment had worked.‘I’m sure that a table really did move,’ she recalls, ‘and I also wrote down some textsthat were dictated to me.’The suspicion that she might have powers as a medium continued to grow from themoment when she was gripped by strange, inexplicable feelings of dread whenever shewent into the bathroom of their apartment. They were odd sensations which she herselfhad difficulty understanding and of which she never spoke to anyone. More than once itentered her mind to turn on the gas for the shower, seal up the exits and kill herself. Onthe afternoon of Monday, 13 October, she left her easel and went into the bathroom.This time the desire to kill herself seemed uncontrollable, but fearing that death byasphyxiation might be very slow and painful she decided to turn to medication. Shecalmly took a taxi to her parents’ house in Jardim Botânico, where she knew she wouldfind the tranquillizers that her mother took regularly–Somalium, she recalls, or Valiumin Paulo’s version of events. Whatever the name of the medication, the fact is that sheemptied a whole pack into her mouth, wrote a short note to Paulo and collapsed on thebed.When he arrived home and Chris wasn’t there, Paulo went to her parents’apartment, where they both often used to have dinner, and found Chris unconscious onthe bed and, beside her, as well as the note, an empty pack of Valium. With the help ofChris’s mother, who had just arrived, he managed to get her to the lift, having firstmade Chris put her finger down her throat and vomit up what she could. Outside, theystopped the first taxi that passed and went to the St Bernard clinic in Gávea, where thedoctors pumped out her stomach. Once recovered, hours later, she was well enough togo home.While she was sleeping and having spoken to her about what happened, Paulo keptasking himself where those strange emanations in the bathroom came from. With thequestion still going round and round in his head, he went downstairs to talk to theporter, tell him what had happened to Chris and see if he had an answer to the mystery.The man said: ‘The last person who lived in that apartment, before you, was an airlinecaptain who gassed himself in the bathroom.’ When he went back upstairs and toldChris the story, she didn’t think twice: despite having been in hospital only a few hoursearlier, she got up, collected together a change of clothes for them both, as well as other"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"personal items, threw everything into a suitcase and announced: ‘We’re going to mymother’s house. I never want to set foot in this apartment again.’Neither of them did, not even to move house. They spent a little more than a monthwith Chris’s parents, long enough for work on the seventh property Paulo had bought tobe completed so that they could move in there. This was a ground-floor apartment witha lovely garden and one particularly priceless feature: it was in the same building asLygia and Pedro’s apartment. He could only have felt more emotionally secure if hewere actually living with his parents.Chris’s rules regarding Paulo’s sexual excesses always prevailed, but they were stillfar from being an average couple. One day, for example, Paulo suggested that theyshould both try an experiment that had its origins in the Middle Ages, and to which hegave the grand name of ‘a reciprocal test of resistance to pain’. Chris agreed, althoughshe knew what was involved: stark naked, they began to whip each other with a thinbamboo cane. They took it in turns to beat the other on the back, the blows growingharder and harder, until they reached the limit of physical endurance. This occurredonly when they were both bleeding from their wounds.Their relationship gradually began to settle down. The first two years passedwithout anything untoward disrupting their life together. Encouraged by her partner,Chris began to paint again, something she had given up four years earlier, while Paulobegan to direct so-called TV specials. Not that they needed money to live on. Besidesthe forty-one songs he had written with Raul Seixas, in the past few years, Paulo hadwritten more than a hundred lyrics–originals or versions of foreign hits–for dozens ofdifferent artists. This meant that the royalties continued to flow into his bank account.He tried to keep busy, however, fearing that idleness would lead him into depressionagain. Besides the TV specials, he gave talks and took part in round-table discussions onmusic and, occasionally, on vampirism. But the cure only worked for a while, becauseeven when he was fully occupied, he would still suffer occasional anxiety attacks.When this occurred, as it did at the end of 1981, he continued to give vent to hisfeelings in his diary:These last two days, I missed two appointments, on the pretext that I washaving a tooth extracted. I’m completely confused as to what to do. I can’t evenbe bothered to write a short press release that would bring in a tiny amount ofmoney. The situation inside me is this. I can’t even write these pages and thisyear, which I was hoping would be better than last, has turned out precisely as Idescribed above. Oh, yes: I haven’t had a bath for the last few days.The crisis appears to have hit him so badly that he even changed his behaviourregarding something that had always been very dear to him–money: ‘I haven’t paid"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"attention to anything, including one of the things that I really like: money. Just imagine,I don’t know how much is in my bank account, something I’ve always known down tothe minutest detail. I’ve lost interest in sex, in writing, in going to the cinema, inreading, even in the plants I’ve been tending so lovingly for so long and that are nowdying because I only water them sporadically.’If he had lost interest in both money and sex, things were very bad indeed, and sohe did what he always did in such situations–he went back to Dr Benjamim, visiting himonce a week. Whenever he felt like this, he would always ask Chris the same question:‘Am I on the right path?’ And so, at the end of 1981, she made a suggestion that struck achord in his nomadic soul: why not just leave everything and go off travelling with nofixed destination and no date set for their return? Her instincts told her that this was theright path. Years later, Chris would recall: ‘Something was telling me that it wouldwork. Paulo trusted my instinct and decided to drop everything.’ Determined to ‘searchfor the meaning of life’, wherever it might be, he asked permission to leave his unpaidpost with TV Globo, bought two air tickets to Madrid–the cheapest he could find–andpromised that he and Chris would return to Brazil only when the last cent of theUS$17,000 he took with him had run out.Unlike all Paulo’s other trips, this one, which was to last eight months, was madewithout any forward planning. Although he took more than enough for a comfortabletrip, with no need to cut corners, he was never one to squander money. He chose Iberia,the airline that not only offered the cheapest flights but added in a free night in a hotelin Madrid. From Spain he and Chris went on to London at the beginning of December1981, where they rented the cheapest car available, a tiny Citroën 2CV. In London, theyalso established the first rule of the trip: neither should carry more than 6 kilos ofluggage. This meant sacrificing the heavy Olivetti typewriter that Paulo had taken withhim; this was shipped back to Brazil.While pondering what direction to take, Paulo and Chris remained in London untilthe middle of January 1982, when they took to the road, determined to visit two places:Prague, where he wanted to make a promise to the Infant Jesus, and Bucharest, thecapital of Romania and birthplace, 550 years earlier, of the nobleman Vlad Tepeş, whowas the inspiration behind Bram Stoker’s creation: the most famous of all the vampires,Count Dracula. On the afternoon of Tuesday, 19 January, they arrived in Vienna frozento the bone, after almost a day travelling the 1,200 or so kilometres separating Londonfrom the capital of Austria. Their modest 2CV had no heater, which meant that they hadto travel wrapped in woollen blankets in order to withstand the low winter temperatures.The stop in Vienna was so that they could obtain visas for Hungary, which they wouldhave to cross in order to reach Romania.Once this was done, they went to the Brazilian embassy, where Chris needed to sortout a small bureaucratic matter. Paulo waited for her out in the street, smoking andwalking up and down. Suddenly, with a sound like a bomb, a vast sheet of ice several"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"metres long slid off the roof of the building five storeys above and crashed on to thestreet, ripping open the bodywork of a car that was parked only a few centimetres fromwhere Paulo was standing. He had been that close to death.After spending the night in Budapest, they left for the capital of Yugoslavia, wherethey decided to stay for three days. Not that Belgrade held any special attraction, butthey couldn’t face getting back into the freezing Citroën. The car had become such aproblem that they decided to hand it back to the rental company. With the help of thehotel manager they found a real bargain: the Indian embassy was selling a light-blueMercedes–nine years old, but in good condition–for a mere US$1,000. Although wellused, it had a 110-horse-power engine and was equipped with an efficient heatingsystem. This would be the only large expense of the trip. For advice on hotels,restaurants and places to visit, they relied on Europe on 20 Dollars a Day.Now that they had a proper car, the 500 kilometres between Belgrade andBucharest, the couple’s next destination, could be done in one day. However, preciselybecause they now had a fast, comfortable car, they chose to take a more roundaboutroute. Having crossed Hungary and part of Austria, driving a little more than 1,000kilometres, they arrived in Prague, where Paulo was to make the promise to the InfantJesus that he would honour almost twenty-five years later. It was only then that theyturned towards Romania, which meant another 1,500 kilometres. For anyone not in ahurry or concerned about money, this was wonderful.During this criss-cross journey across Central Europe, chance placed anotherdestination in their path. It was not until a few weeks after buying the Mercedes thatPaulo discovered that the car had originally come from the old Federal Republic ofGermany (or West Germany) and that the change of ownership had to be registered atthe licensing authority in Bonn, the then capital of West Germany. Travelling fromBucharest to Bonn meant a journey of almost 2,000 kilometres, a distance that now heldno worries for them. Two days after leaving the capital of Romania, the blue Mercedeswas crossing the frontier into West Germany. From Bucharest to Munich, the firstGerman city they went through, the odometer showed that they had driven 1,193kilometres. Munich was completely covered in snow, it was almost midday and sinceneither of the travellers was hungry, instead of lunching there, they decided to stop inStuttgart, about 200 kilometres farther on. Minutes after passing through Munich, thecapital of Bavaria, Paulo turned the car off the road into an avenue of bare trees with asign written in German: ‘Dachau Konzentrationslager’. It had long been in his mind tovisit the sadly famous Nazi concentration camp in Dachau–since he was a boy he hadbeen a passionate reader of books and stories about the Second World War–but little didhe imagine that this visit, which lasted only a few hours, would radically change hislife."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21First meeting with JeanALTHOUGH HE WOULD NOT PUBLISH his first real book until 1987, Paulo Coelho theauthor was born on 23 February 1982 at the age of thirty-five in Dachau concentrationcamp in Germany. Five days earlier, he had had a strange experience in Prague.Immediately after making his promise to the Infant Jesus of Prague, he had gone outwith Chris for a walk round the city which, like almost all of Central Europe, wascovered in snow and with below-zero temperatures. They crossed the river Vltava by theimposing Charles Bridge. One end of the bridge is in the Old City; the other comes outinto the Street of Alchemists where, according to legend, lies the entrance to hellthrough which, naturally, Paulo was determined to go. The object of his interest was amedieval dungeon, which had been opened to the public some years before. In order toget in, he and Chris had to wait until the place had emptied of an enormous group ofSoviet recruits–who appeared to be there as tourists.Minutes after going through the doors of the dark dungeon and entering the cells,Paulo felt as though the ghosts from which he had believed himself to be free werereviving–the electroshock therapy, his supposed meeting with the Devil, hisimprisonment by the Dops, his abduction, his cowardly betrayal of Gisa. From onemoment to the next, all those events seemed to rise up, as though they had only justhappened. He began to sob convulsively and Chris led him away. The gloomysurroundings had reawakened memories that threatened to propel him into a fit of deepdepression, and he was thousands of kilometres from the security provided by hisparents, Dr Benjamim’s consulting rooms or Roberto Menescal.This time, the origins of his torment were not metaphysical but all too real andvisible on the pages of the newspapers and on the TV news: dictatorships, the stateoppression of people, wars, abductions and clandestine imprisonments, which appearedto be sweeping the planet. Civil war was to claim almost 80,000 lives in the tiny state ofEl Salvador. In Chile, the savage dictatorship of General Pinochet was about tocelebrate ten years of its existence and appeared to be as firmly entrenched as ever. InBrazil, the military dictatorship seemed exhausted, but there was still no guarantee thatdemocracy was within reach. This was the worst possible state of mind in which to visitthe site of a Nazi concentration camp, but this was precisely how Paulo was feelingwhen he parked the Mercedes in the visitors’ car park in Dachau.Dachau was the first camp built by the Third Reich and was the model for theremaining fifty-six scattered across ten European countries. It operated from 1933 until"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"April 1945, when its gates were opened by the Allied troops. Although it was planned tohouse 6,000 prisoners, on the day of its liberation there were more than 30,000. Duringthat tragic period, about 200,000 people of sixteen nationalities were taken there.Although the majority were Jews, there were also communists, socialists and othersopposed to Nazism, as well as Gypsies and Jehovah’s Witnesses. For reasons as yetunknown, the gas chamber in Dachau was never put to use, which meant that anyprisoners who were condemned to death had to be taken by bus to Hartheim Castle,halfway between the camp and Linz, in Austria, which had been transformed into acentre of mass execution. The first surprise for Paulo and Chris as they went through theentrance gates of Dachau was that there was absolutely no one there. It wasunderstandable that the freezing wind might have kept away the tourists, but they didn’tsee any porters, guards or officials who could give them any information. They were–orthey appeared to be–alone in that enormous 180,000-square-metre rectangle surroundedon all sides by walls and empty watch towers. Paulo had not yet gotten over the darkthoughts that had assailed him in Prague some days before, but he didn’t want to missthe opportunity of visiting one of the largest Nazi concentration camps. They followedthe arrows and took the suggested route for visitors–the same as that taken by theprisoners. They went into the reception area, where the newly arrived prisoners wouldreceive their uniforms, have their heads shaved and be ‘disinfected’ in a collective bathof insecticide. Then they walked down the corridors lined by cells, in which they sawthe hooks attached to the ceiling beams from which the prisoners were hung by theirarms during torture sessions; then they went into the sheds where, until the end of thewar, bunk beds were stacked three or four high and where the prisoners slept likeanimals, packed into wooden cages. In total silence, their horror only grew with eachnew revelation.Although Paulo was clearly upset, he saw the concentration camps as a tragedy ofthe past, part of the Nazism that was defeated in a war that had ended even before hewas born. However, in the room set aside for the relatives of the dead to pay theirrespects, he felt that the emotions aroused in Prague were returning. The cards pinnedon bunches of fresh flowers that had been put there only a few days earlier were livingproof that Dachau was still an open wound. The 30,000 dead were not meaninglessnames taken from books, but human beings whose cruel deaths were recent enough stillto awaken the grief of widows, children, brothers and sisters.Paulo and Chris returned to the open area of the camp feeling overwhelmed. Theywalked along an avenue of bare trees whose branches looked like bony claws reachingfor the sky. In the north part of the camp there were three small religious buildings–Catholic, Protestant and Jewish–beside which a fourth–Russian Orthodox–was to bebuilt in the 1990s. The couple walked straight past these buildings, following a signindicating the most chilling place in Dachau: the crematorium. At that point, theynoticed a radical change in the landscape. Unlike the barren camp itself, which is a"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"lunar landscape of grey stones with not a hint of greenery, the path leading to thecrematorium passes through a small wood. Even in the hardest of winters this is coveredby vegetation of tropical exuberance, with gardens, flowers and pathways between rowsof shrubs. Planted in a clearing in the middle of the wood is a modest, rustic, red-brickbuilding, which can only be distinguished from a traditional family house by thechimney, which seems disproportionately large. This was the crematorium oven, wherethe bodies of more than thirty thousand prisoners would have been burnt after theirexecution or death from starvation, suicide or illness, such as the typhoid epidemic thatdevastated the camp a few months before its liberation.His experience in the medieval prison in Prague was still very clear in Paulo’smind. He saw all eight red-brick ovens and the metal stretchers on which the bodieswould have been piled for incineration, and he stopped in front of a peeling door onwhich one word was written: ‘Badzimmer’. This was not an old bathroom, as the nameindicated, but the Dachau gas chamber. Although it was never used, Paulo wanted tofeel for himself the terror experienced by millions in the Nazi extermination camps. Heleft Chris alone for a moment, went into the chamber and shut the door. Leaning againstthe wall, he looked up and saw, hanging from the ceiling, the fake showerheads fromwhich the gas would be released. His blood froze and he left that place with the stenchof death in his nose.When he stepped out of the crematorium he heard the small bell of the Catholicchapel chiming midday. He went towards that sound and as he re-entered the harsh greyof the camp, he saw an enormous modern sculpture, which recalled Picasso’s Guernica.On it was written in several languages ‘Never again!’ As he read the two words onentering the small church, a moment of peace came to him, as he was to remembermany years later: ‘I’m entering the church, my eye alights on that “Never Again!” and Isay: Thank God for that! Never again! Never again is that going to happen! How good!Never again! Never again will there be that knock on the door at midnight, never againwill people just disappear. What joy! Never again will the world experience that!’He went into the chapel feeling full of hope and yet in the short space of timebetween lighting a candle and saying a quick prayer, he suddenly felt overwhelmedagain by his old ghosts. In a moment, he went from faith to despair. As he crossed thefrozen camp, a short way behind Chris, he realized that the ‘Never again!’ he had justread was nothing more than a joke in several languages:I said to myself: what do they mean ‘Never again!’? ‘Never again’, my eye!What happened in Dachau is still happening in the world, on my continent, inmy country. In Brazil, opponents of the regime were thrown from helicoptersinto the sea. I myself, on an infinitely smaller scale, lived for several years in astate of paranoia after being the victim of that same violence! I suddenlyremembered the cover of Time with the killings in El Salvador, the dirty war"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"waged by the Argentine dictatorship against the opposition. At that moment, Ilost all hope in the human race. I felt that I had reached rock bottom. I decidedthat the world is shit, life is shit, and I’m nothing but shit for having donenothing about it.While he was thinking these contradictory thoughts, a sentence began going round andround in his head: ‘No man is an island.’ Where had he read that? Slowly, he managedto rebuild and recite to himself almost the entire passage: ‘No man is an island entire ofitself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washedaway by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if amanor of thy friends or of thine own were; any man’s death diminishes me, because Iam involved in mankind...’ For a moment he could not remember the rest, but when hedid, it seemed to have opened all the doors of his memory: ‘and therefore never send toknow for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee’. It was from one of John Donne’sMeditations, from which Ernest Hemingway took the title for his novel. What happenedin the following minutes is something that will remain for ever cloaked in mystery;indeed Paulo himself, on one of the few occasions when he has been urged to describewhat occurred, became so emotional that he wept copiously: ‘We were in the middle ofa concentration camp, Chris and I, alone, absolutely alone, without another living soularound! At that moment I heard the sign: I felt that the bells of the chapel were ringingfor me. That’s when I had my epiphany.’According to him, the revelation in Dachau took the form of a beam of light, underwhich a being of human appearance apparently told him something about possiblymeeting again in two months’ time. This message was given not in a human voice but,as Paulo himself put it, ‘in a communication of souls’. Even the most sceptical wouldperhaps agree that something took place in Dachau, so radical was the change in Paulo’slife from that day on. When he reached the car park, he wept as he told Chris what hehad just experienced, and the first, horrifying suspicion fell on the OTO. What if whathe had seen minutes earlier were the reincarnation of the Beast? Had the ghosts ofCrowley and Marcelo Motta returned to frighten him eight years on? When theyreached Bonn, six hours later, Paulo settled on the most rational explanation: he wouldconsider the vision as a delirium, a brief hallucination provoked by the fear and tensionhe was feeling.The couple planned to stay in Bonn just long enough to sort out the paperwork forthe car and to meet Paula, a niece who had been born a few months earlier. Since theywere staying at the home of Chris’s sister, Tânia, and so were free of hotel expenses,they decided to extend their stay to a week. In early March, the couple set off onceagain, this time to cover the 250 kilometres between them and the liberal city ofAmsterdam, which had so enchanted Paulo ten years earlier.They stayed in the Hotel Brouwer, on the edge of the Singel Canal, where they paid"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"US$17 a day for bed and breakfast. In a letter to his parents Paulo talked of the potshops, ‘cafés where you can freely buy and smoke drugs that are considered soft, likehashish and cannabis, although cocaine, heroin, opium and amphetamines, includingLSD, are prohibited’, and he took the opportunity to add a subtle apology for theliberalization of the drugs: ‘This doesn’t mean that the Dutch youth are drugged all thetime. On the contrary, government statistics show that there are far fewer drug addictshere, proportionally speaking, than in the USA, Germany, England and France. Hollandhas the lowest rate of unemployment in the whole of Western Europe, and Amsterdamis the fourth largest commercial centre of the world.’It was in this liberal atmosphere, where the two smoked cannabis until they gottired of it, that Chris tried LSD for the first and only time. Paulo was so shocked by thedevastating effects of heroin on its users–zombies of various nationalities wandered thestreets of the city–that he wrote two articles for the Brazilian magazine Fatos&Fotosentitled ‘Heroin, the Road of No Return’ and ‘Amsterdam, the Kiss of the Needle’. Hisrelationship with this underworld, however, was strictly professional, that of aninvestigative reporter. Judging by the letters he sent to his father, their European tourwas a hippie journey in appearance only: ‘We haven’t deprived ourselves of anything,lunching and dining every day. And although we have a very thirsty child to support(the 110-horse-power Mercedes), we go to cinemas, saunas, barbers, nightclubs andeven casinos.’There seemed to be no end to the good life. After several weeks in the city, Paulobecame bored by so much cannabis. He had tried varieties from places as far away asthe Yemen and Bolivia. He had smoked blends of every strength and experimented withplants that had won prizes in the Cannabis Cup, the marijuana world cup which was heldonce a year in Amsterdam. He had even tried a new product called skunk–cannabisgrown in a hot house and fed with fertilizers and proteins. And it was there, in thathippie paradise, that Paulo discovered that the plant had nothing more to offer him. Hewas, he said, ‘fed up’ with its repetitious effects. He repeated the oath he had madeeight years earlier in New York regarding cocaine: he would never again smokecannabis.He was explaining all this to Chris in the hotel café when he felt a cold shiver runthrough him, just as he had in Dachau. He glanced to one side and saw that the shape hehad seen in the concentration camp had taken physical form and was there having tea ata table nearby. His first feeling was one of terror. He had heard of societies which, inorder to preserve their secrets, would pursue and even kill those who had left. Was hebeing followed by people belonging to a satanist group from the other side of the world?He suddenly remembered the lesson he had learned during those PE classes in Fortalezade São João: to avoid unnecessary pain, confront the fear straight away.He looked at the stranger–a man in his forties of European appearance, in jacketand tie–and summoned up his courage to address him in English in a deliberately"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"hostile way: ‘I saw you two months ago in Dachau and I’m going to make one thingclear: I have not, nor do I wish to have, anything to do with occultism, sects or orders. Ifthat’s why you’re here, then you’ve had a wasted journey.’The man looked up and reacted quite calmly and, to Paulo’s surprise, he replied influent Portuguese, albeit with a strong accent: ‘Don’t worry. Come and join me so thatwe can talk.’‘May I bring my partner?’‘No, I want to talk to you alone.’Paulo made a sign to Chris to reassure her that everything was all right. Then hewent and sat at the other man’s table and asked: ‘Talk about what?’‘What’s all this about a concentration camp?’‘I thought I saw you there two months ago.’The man said that there must be some confusion. Paulo insisted: ‘I’m sorry, but Ithink that we met in February in the concentration camp at Dachau. You don’tremember?’The man then admitted that Paulo might have seen him, but that it could also havebeen a phenomenon known as ‘astral projection’, something Paulo knew about and towhich he had referred many times in his diary. The man said: ‘I wasn’t at theconcentration camp, but I understand what you’re saying. Let me look at the palm ofyour hand.’ Paulo cannot remember whether he showed him his left or his right hand,but the mysterious man studied it hard and then began to speak very slowly. He did notseem to be reading the lines on his hand; it was more as if he were seeing a vision:‘There is some unfinished business here. Something fell apart around 1974 or 1975. Inmagical terms, you grew up in the Tradition of the Serpent, and you may not even knowwhat the Tradition of the Dove is.’As a voracious reader of everything to do with magic, Paulo knew that thesetraditions were two different routes leading to the same place: magical knowledge,understood as the ability to use gifts that not all humans succeed in developing. TheTradition of the Dove (also known as the Tradition of the Sun) is a system of gradual,continuous learning, during which any disciple or novice will always depend on aMaster, with a capital ‘M’. On the other hand, the Tradition of the Serpent (or Traditionof the Moon) is usually chosen by intuitive individuals and, according to its initiates, bythose who, in a previous existence, had some connection with or commitment to magic.The two routes are not mutually exclusive, and candidates to the so-called magicaleducation are recommended to follow the Tradition of the Dove once they havefollowed that of the Serpent.Paulo began to relax when the man finally introduced himself. He was French, ofJewish origin, worked in Paris as an executive for the Dutch multinational Philips andwas an active member of an old, mysterious Catholic religious order called RAM whichstood for Regnus Agnus Mundi–Lamb of the Kingdom of the World–or ‘Rigour,"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Adoration and Mercy’. He had gained his knowledge of Portuguese from long periodsspent in Brazil and Portugal working for Philips. His real name–which could be‘Chaim’, ‘Jayme’ or ‘Jacques’–has never been revealed by Paulo, who began to refer tohim publicly as ‘the Master’, ‘Jean’ or simply ‘J’.In measured tones, Jean said that he knew Paulo had started out along the roadtowards black magic, but had interrupted that journey. He said: ‘If you want to take upthe road to magic again and if you would like to do so within our order, then I can guideyou. But, once you have made the decision, you will have to do whatever I tell youwithout argument.’Astonished by what he was hearing, Paulo asked for time to reflect. Jean wasuncompromising: ‘You have a day to make your decision. I shall wait for you heretomorrow at the same time.’Paulo could think of nothing else. While he had felt great relief at leaving the OTOand rejecting the ideas of Crowley, the world of magic, as opposed to black magic,continued to hold an enormous fascination for him. He recalled later: ‘Emotionally Iwas still connected to it. It’s like falling in love with a woman, and sending her awaybecause she really doesn’t fit in with your life. But you go on loving her. One day sheturns up in a bar, as J did, and you say: “Please, go away. I don’t want to see you again,I don’t want to suffer again.”’Unable to sleep, he spent all night talking to Chris, and it was dawn when he finallymade up his mind. Something was telling him that this was an important moment andhe decided to accept the challenge, for good or ill. Some hours later, he met for thesecond (or was it the third?) time the mysterious man who from that moment was to behis Master–always with a capital M. Jean explained to Paulo what the first stepstowards his initiation would be: on the Tuesday of the following week he was to go tothe Vikingskipshuset, the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo.‘Go to the room where you will find three ships called the Gokstad, Oseberg andBorre on display. There someone will hand you something.’Not quite understanding what he was being asked to do, Paulo wanted to knowmore. ‘But what time should I be at the museum? How will I recognize the person? Is ita man or a woman? What will they give me?’As Jean stood up, leaving a few coins on the table in payment for the cup of tea hehad drunk, he satisfied only a part of Paulo’s curiosity: ‘Be in the room when themuseum opens its doors. The other questions need no answer. You will be told when weare to see each other again.’ And then he vanished, as if he had never existed–if indeedhe ever did exist. Whether real or supernatural, one thing was certain: he had left hisnew disciple a task that would begin with a journey of almost 1,000 kilometres to thecapital of Norway, a city Paulo had never been to before. They drove there through thesnow via Holland, Germany and Denmark. On the appointed day, Paulo woke early,worried that he might arrive late and fearing that any queues and groups of tourists at"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"the museum might delay him. The publicity leaflet from the museum, which he hadpicked up in the lobby of the hotel, informed him that the doors opened at nine in themorning, but he set off a whole hour earlier. Situated on the Bygdøy Peninsula, tenminutes’ drive from the centre of the city, the Vikingskipshuset is a large yellowbuilding in the shape of a cross, with no windows and a pointed roof. It was only whenhe arrived that Paulo realized he had misunderstood the opening hours. The museumwas open from nine in the morning until six in the evening during the high season, butfrom October to April, the doors only opened at eleven. He spent the time reflecting onthe decision he had just taken. ‘I had tried everything in order to realize my dream to bea writer, but I was still a nobody,’ Paulo was to recall later. ‘I had abandoned blackmagic and the occult sciences when I discovered that they were of no help to me at all,so why not try the route Jean was suggesting?’At eleven on the dot, he joined the half-dozen Japanese tourists who were alsowaiting and followed the arrows to the room with high, curved walls like a church nave,where the Gokstad, Oseberg and Borre were displayed. There was only one other personthere–a pretty blonde woman of about forty, who seemed to be absorbed in reading aplaque on one of the walls. When she heard his footsteps, she turned, revealing that shewas holding something long, like a walking stick or a sword. She said nothing, butwalked towards him, took a silver ring bearing the image of an ouroboros–the snake thatdevours its own tail–from the ring finger of her left hand and placed it on the middlefinger of his left hand. She then traced an imaginary circle on the floor with the stick orsword, indicating that Paulo should stand inside it. Then, she made a gesture as ifpouring the contents of a cup into the circle. She moved her right hand across Paulo’sface without touching it, indicating that he should shut his eyes. ‘At that moment I feltthat someone had liberated stagnant energies,’ he said years later, ‘as though thespiritual floodgate of a lake had been opened, allowing fresh water to enter.’ When heopened his eyes again, the only sign left by the mysterious woman was the strange ring,which he would wear for the rest of his life.Paulo would only be in contact with Jean again much later, when he returned toBrazil. At the end of April 1982, he was supposed to return to his job with TV Globo,but after discussing it at length with Chris, he decided not to return to work but toremain in Europe. They had more than enough money to allow them to stay for anotherthree months in Amsterdam.And so it wasn’t until the middle of July that they drove the 1,900 kilometres fromAmsterdam to Lisbon–a journey of three days–from where they would take a plane toBrazil. However, the first visible change in Paulo Coelho’s behaviour following hismeeting with his Master took place on European soil. Only some supernatural forcecould have persuaded someone as careful with money as he was to donate the Mercedesto a charitable institution, the Sisterhood of the Infant Jesus for the Blind, rather thanselling it and pocketing the thousand dollars."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22Paulo and Christina–publishersWHEN THEY ARRIVED IN RIO, reinvigorated by their eight long months in Europe, Pauloand Chris settled back into the ground-floor apartment in Rua Raimundo Correia, inwhich her parents had been living since their departure. He began his initiation tasks.These so-called ordeals, which would lead to his being admitted to RAM, would arrivein either a letter or a phone call from Jean. The first of these, ‘the ritual of the glass’,involved a short ceremony that he was to perform alone each day for six months, alwaysat the same hour. He had to fill a glass that had never been used with water, and place iton the table. He then had to open the New Testament at any page, read out loud aparagraph at random and drink the water. The passage he had read was to be markedwith the date of the reading. If, on the following days, he alighted on the same text, thenhe should read the following paragraph. If he had read that one too, then he was to findanother that had not been previously read. Paulo chose the early morning as the besttime to perform this penance, so that it would not clash with anything else. And since nospecific instruction had been given as to the size or shape of the glass, he bought a smallshot glass, which could, if necessary, be discreetly carried around with a copy of theNew Testament.Fortunately, none of the trials demanded by Jean prevented him from leading anormal life. Money continued to be no problem, but his partnership with Raul hadclearly fallen out of fashion. Their records continued to sell, but royalties from therecording company were not pouring in as they had before. Although a regular incomefrom the five apartments he rented out guaranteed a comfortable lifestyle, his lack ofactivity was likely to propel him once more into depression. Therefore the best thing todo would be to find some more work as soon as possible.A year before his trip to Europe, Paulo had persuaded Chris that she should start acompany, Shogun Editora e Arte Ltda, which was primarily created for tax purposes tocover the architectural work she was doing, but which also meant that they both hadbusiness cards, letterheads and envelopes stating that they were a legal entity. Inaddition, as he said, when the time came for him to write his books, why not publishthem himself? On returning to Brazil, he decided to put this idea into action and rentedtwo rooms in a building on Rua Cinco de Julho in Copacabana, two blocks from theapartment where they lived. Although it managed to grow and even to bring in someincome, Shogun was never more than a small family firm whose day-to-day businesswas handled by its two owners, with the accounts done by Paulo’s father, who had just"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"retired. They had only one paid employee–an office boy.Less than three months after their return to Brazil, in October 1982, the publishinghouse launched its first book: Arquivos do Inferno [Archives of Hell], a collection ofsixteen texts written by the proprietor, Paulo Coelho. On the cover was a picture of theauthor sitting cross-legged in front of a typewriter, holding a cigarette and apparentlydeep in thought, while beside him are two young women with bare breasts: one wasChris, and the other was Stella Paula, his old colleague from his Crowley witchcraftdays. In the photo she had such long hair that it not only covered most of her breasts butfell below her waist. Although it was little more than a booklet (it was only 106 pageslong), Arquivos do Inferno was certainly a record-breaker in terms of prefaces,forewords and notes on the inside flaps. The preface, entitled ‘Preface to the DutchEdition’, was signed by the pop genius Andy Warhol (who, as Paulo confessed yearslater, never read the book):I met Paulo Coelho at an exhibition of mine in London, and discovered in himthe kind of forward-looking nature one finds in very few people. Rather thanbeing a literary man in search of clever ideas, he coolly and accurately toucheson the concerns and preoccupations of the present time. Dear Paulo, you askedfor a preface to your book. I would say that your book is a preface to the newera that is just beginning, before the old one has even ended. Anyone who, likeyou, strides forward, never runs the risk of falling into a hole, because theangels will spread their cloaks out on the ground to catch you.The second was written by Jimmy Brouwer, the owner of the hotel where the couple hadstayed in Amsterdam; the third by the journalist Artur da Távola, Paulo’s colleague atPhilips; the fourth by the psychiatrist Eduardo Mascarenhas, who at the time was thepresenter of a television programme and a Member of Parliament; and the fifth byRoberto Menescal, who was one of the book’s two dedicatees, the other being Chris.Nothing about the book quite fits. According to the cover, it was supposedly a co-edition by Shogun with a Dutch publisher, the Brouwer Free Press, a firm thatapparently never existed. A press release distributed by Shogun confused things stillmore by stating that the book had been published abroad, which was not true: ‘After itssuccessful launch in Holland, where it was acclaimed by critics and public alike afteronly two months in the shops, Arquivos do Inferno, by Paulo Coelho, will be in all thebookshops in Brazil this month.’ The information given about the author’s previousworks muddied the waters still further, including as it did something entitled Lon:Diário de um Mago, which had apparently been published by Shogun in 1979, eventhough the firm did not exist at that time and Diário de um Mago (translated as ThePilgrimage in English) wasn’t published until 1987. On one of the few occasions, years"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"later, when he spoke about the matter, Paulo gave a strange explanation: ‘It can onlyhave been a prophecy.’ On the imprint page, in tiny print, is another peculiarity: ‘300copies of the first editions in Portuguese and Dutch will be numbered and signed by theauthor and sold at US$350 each, the money to be donated to the Order of the GoldenStar.’The book did not contain a single chapter or essay that dealt with the themementioned in the title–hell. The sixteen texts are a jumble of subjects arranged in noparticular order, covering such disparate matters as the proverbs of the English poetWilliam Blake, the rudiments of homoeopathy and astrology, and passages frommanuscripts by a certain Pero Vaz and from Paulo’s own works, such as ‘The Pieces’:It is very important to know that I have scattered parts of my body across theworld. I cut my nails in Rome, my hair in Holland and Germany. I saw myblood moisten the asphalt of New York and often my sperm fell on French soilin a field of vines near Tours. I have expelled my faeces into rivers on threecontinents, watered some trees in Spain with my urine and spat in the EnglishChannel and a fjord in Oslo. Once I grazed my face and left some cells attachedto a fence in Budapest. These small things–created by me and which I shallnever see again–give me a pleasant feeling of omnipresence. I am a small partof the places I have visited, of the landscapes I have seen and that moved me.Besides this, my scattered parts have a practical use: in my next incarnation Iam not going to feel alone or unprotected because something familiar–a hair, apiece of nail, some old, dried spit–will always be close by. I have sown myseed in several places on this earth because I don’t know where I will one daybe reborn.The most striking feature of the book is the second chapter, entitled ‘The Truth aboutthe Inquisition’. Paulo makes it clear that this was not written by him, but was dictatedby the spirit of Torquemada, the Dominican friar who was in charge of the trials held bythe Holy Office in Spain at the end of the fifteenth century. As though wanting to clearhimself of any responsibility for its content, the author explains that not only thespelling and the underlinings but also ‘some syntactical errors’ were retained exactly asdictated by the spirit of the Grand Inquisitor. The eight pages of the chapter are filledwith celebrations of torture and martyrdom as instruments in the defence of the faith:It is therefore most just that the death penalty be applied to those whoobstinately propagate heresy and so ensure that the most precious gift of man,Faith, is lost for ever![...] Anyone who has the right to command also has the right to punish!"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"And the authority that has the power to make laws also has the power to ensurethat those laws are obeyed![...] Spiritual punishment is not always enough. The majority of people areincapable of understanding it. The Church should, as I did, have the right toapply physical punishment!Apparently wanting to attribute a scientific character to this psychic writing, Paulo endsthe text with a curious parenthetical observation: ‘[After these words, no othercommunication was made by what called itself the “spirit of Torquemada”. As it isalways important to note the conditions in which a transmission was made–with a viewto future scientific investigations–I recorded the ambient temperature (29°C), theatmospheric pressure (760 mmHg), weather conditions (cloudy) and the time themessage was received (21h15m to 22h07m)].’This was not the first occasion on which Paulo had shown an interest in the HolyOffice of the Inquisition. In September 1971, he had thought of writing a play on thesubject and during his research he came across a book by Henrique Hello, published byEditora Vozes in 1936 and reprinted in 1951, the title of which was The Truth about theInquisition. The ninety-page text is a long peroration in defence of the objectives andmethods used by the Inquisition. Part had been quoted in the preface to O SantoInquérito [The Holy Inquisition], written in 1966 by the playwright Dias Gomes. Whenhe finished reading it, Paulo had concluded ironically: ‘I set to work on the play aboutthe Inquisition. It’s an easy play. It simply plagiarizes what someone called HenriqueHello said about it. No, it doesn’t plagiarize, it criticizes. The guy wrote a book calledThe Truth about the Inquisition in favour of the Inquisition!’Probably because of his imprisonment and abduction in 1974, Paulo held back fromcriticizing the author and simply transcribed his words. A comparison between thecontent of Arquivos do Inferno and the 1936 publication shows that if it was in fact anexample of psychic writing, the spirit that dictated ‘The Truth about the Inquisition’was that of Henrique Hello and not Torquemada, since 95 per cent of the text is simplycopied from Hello’s work.None of this, however, surpasses the extraordinary piece of information the authorgives at the beginning of ‘The Truth about the Inquisition’. He states there that theautomatic writing had occurred ‘on the night of 28 May 1974’. The fact is that, between21.15 and 22.07 on the night of 28 May 1974, Paulo was lying handcuffed on the floorof a car with his head covered by a hood and was being driven to the buildings of theDOI-Codi. It is hard to believe that the prison guards of one of the most violent prisonsof the Brazilian dictatorship would have allowed a prisoner to write such an essay, eventhough it was a treatise in praise of torture. The author seems to have realized thatArquivos do Inferno would not stand up to scrutiny, and once the first, modest print runhad sold out, he did not publish it again. When he had become an international name,"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"the work was mentioned discreetly on his website: ‘In 1982 he published his first book,Arquivos do Inferno, which made no impact whatsoever.’A quarter of a century after this major failure, Arquivos became a rarity sought bycollectors in auctions on the Internet with starting prices of about US$220, as thoughPaulo’s initial fantasy were finally coming to fruition.The lack of success of Shogun’s debut book acted as an important lesson, since itmade it clear that this was an undertaking requiring a professional approach.Determined to do things properly, Paulo took over the management of the business, andhis first step was to take a seven-week correspondence course on financial planning.The course seems to have borne fruit, since in 1984, two years after it was set up,Shogun was ranked thirty-fourth among Brazilian publishers listed in the specialistmagazine Leia Livros, rivalling traditional publishing houses such as CivilizaçãoBrasileira and Agir, and even Rocco (which some years later would become Paulo’spublisher in Brazil). Shogun rented stands at book fairs and biennials and had a backlistof more than seventy titles.Among the authors published, besides the proprietors themselves, there were onlytwo well-known names, neither of whom was exactly a writer: the rock singer NeusinhaBrizola, the daughter of the then governor of Rio, Leonel Brizola (O Livro Negro deNeusinha Brizola [The Black Book of Neusinha Brizola]), and the ever-present ‘closeenemy’, Raul Seixas (As Aventuras de Raul Seixas na Cidade de Thor [Raul Seixas’Adventures in the City of Thor]). Shogun’s success was, in fact, due to hundreds andthousands of anonymous poets from all over Brazil who, like the owner of Shogun, haddreamed for years of one day having a book of their poetry published. In a countrywhere hundreds of young authors were desperate to publish, Shogun came up with theperfect solution: the ‘Raimundo Correia Poetry Competition’.Paulo placed small advertisements in newspapers and left flyers at the doors oftheatres and cinemas, inviting unpublished poets from across Brazil to take part in thecompetition, which had been named after the street in which Paulo and Chris lived, inturn named after an influential Brazilian poet who had died in 1911. The rules weresimple. The competition was open to poems written in Portuguese by ‘authors, whetheramateur or professional, published or not, and of any age’. Each person could submit upto three poems of a maximum length of two pages double-spaced, and a ‘committee ofcritics and experts of high standing’ (whose names were never revealed) would selectthose to be included in an anthology to be published by Shogun. Those selected wouldreceive a contract under which they committed themselves to paying US$175, for whichthey would receive ten copies. To the couple’s surprise, one of the competitionsreceived no fewer than 1,150 poems, of which 116 were selected for a book entitledPoetas Brasileiros. The publishers ran no financial risk at all, because the work waspublished only after the authors had paid up. Each contributor would receive, along withthe books, a certificate produced by Shogun and signed by Chris, and a handwritten note"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"from Paulo:Dear So and So,I have received and read your poems. Without going into the merits of thematerial–which, as you yourself know, is of the highest quality–I should like tocompliment you on not having let your poems stay in a drawer. In today’sworld, and during this particularly exceptional period of History, it is necessaryto have the courage to make one’s thoughts public.Once again my congratulations,Paulo CoelhoWhat at first sight had appeared to be an amateur enterprise turned out to be very goodbusiness indeed. When the couple sent off the last package of books in the post, Shogunhad earned the equivalent of US$187,000. The success of an apparently simple ideaencouraged Paulo and Chris to repeat the project on a larger scale. A few weeks later,Shogun announced competitions to select poems to be published in four newanthologies, entitled Poetas Brasileiros de Hoje, A Nova Poesia Brasileira, A NovaLiteratura Brasileira and Antologia Poética de Cidades Brasileiras. In order tomotivate those who had been rejected in the first anthology, Chris sent each of them anencouraging letter in which she explained that the number of poems to be awarded theprize of publication was to rise from 116 to 250:Rio de Janeiro, 29 August 1982Dear Poet,A large number of the works that failed to be placed in the RaimundoCorreia Poetry Competition were of very high quality. Therefore, although weare forced to restrict the number of winning poems to 250, we have decided tofind a solution for those poems which, either because they did not comply withthe rules or because they were not selected by the Committee of Judges, werenot included in the Anthology.The book Poetas Brasileiros de Hoje–another Shogun publication–is to bepublished this year. We would love one of your poems to be included in thisanthology. Each of the authors will pay the amount stated in the attachedagreement and, in exchange, will receive ten copies of the first edition. Thismeans that, for each copy, you will be paying only a little more than you wouldpay for a weekly news magazine, and you will be investing in yourself,increasing the sphere of influence of your work and, eventually, opening doorsto a fascinating career."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"As stated in the attached agreement, Shogun will send copies of PoetasBrasileiros de Hoje to the best-known literary critics in the country, andpublicity material will be sent to more than two hundred important newspapersand magazines.

Now, with thissystem of sharing the costs, it is possible to produce the book quite cheaply andfor it to be read and commented upon throughout the country.

On the evenings when the diplomas and other awards werehanded out, there were so many present that the publisher was forced to hire the CircoVoador in Lapa, one of the newest venues in Rio, to accommodate the winning bardsand their guests. Chris also organized public events, usually held in busy places, wherethe authors would recite their prize-winning poetry to passers-by, who would stop,genuinely interested, to listen to the poetry. There was, of course, always some problem,such as those who took a long time to pay or the poet who wrote a letter of protest to theJornal do Brasil:I took part in the Fifth Raimundo Correia Poetry Competition and was awardeda prize for my poem ‘Ser humano’. In order for my poem to be published, I hadto pay a fee of Cr$380,000 in four instalments, for which I would receive tencopies of the book. When I paid the final instalment, I received the books.When I saw them and opened them, I was so disappointed that I didn’t evenwant to read them. I realized, then, that I had fallen for a confidence trick.The book uses very old-fashioned typography, and the design itself is oneof the worst I’ve ever seen, muddled and ugly. It is Shogun’s philosophy thathe who does not pay is not published. I know of several people who wereexcluded because they couldn’t pay all the instalments. 116 poets werepublished. By my calculations, Shogun have made a total of Cr$44 million, andhave the right to use our money as they wish from the very first instalment.Considering the amount we paid, we deserved something better. I work inthe field of graphic design myself, and so feel able to make these criticisms. I"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"wouldn’t give the book away as a present or even sell it to my worst enemy.Rui Dias de Carvalho–Rio de JaneiroA week later, the Jornal do Brasil published Shogun’s reply in which the directorChristina Oiticica stated that the printers who produced their books were the same asthose who worked for such publishing giants as Record and Nova Fronteira. As formaking money from the anthology, she responded by saying that this was used tofinance projects that would never interest large publishers, such as Poesia na Prisão (acompetition held among prisoners within the Rio de Janeiro prison system), withoutdepending upon public funds: ‘We do not beg for support from the state for our culturalactivities. We are independent and proud of the fact, because all of us–publishers andpoets–are proving that it is possible for new artists to get their work published.’The complaints did not seem to be shared by other authors published by Shogun.Many years later, the poet Marcelino Rodriguez recalled proudly in his Internet blogseeing his ‘Soneto Eterno’ included in the publisher’s anthology: ‘My first literaryventure was produced by Shogun, owned by Paulo Coelho (who is now our mostimportant writer, although many “academics” do not recognize his worth, perhapsbecause they do not understand the content of his work) and Christina Oiticica, who is ahighly talented artist (I still haven’t forgotten the smile she gave me when I visited theoffice once).’The fact is that, as well as encouraging young authors, the project proved to be asuccessful business enterprise. By organizing four anthologies a year, Shogun couldearn some 160 million cruzeiros a year. Between 1983 and 1986, there was a boom inanthologies and poetry competitions, and so these sums may have been even greater,particularly when Shogun doubled the number of prize-winners. At the age of nearlyforty, Paulo’s life finally seemed to be working out. Chris was proving to be awonderful partner–their relationship grew more solid by the day–and business wasflourishing. All that was needed to complete his happiness was to realize his old dreamof becoming a world-famous writer. He continued to receive spiritual guidance fromJean, but this did not prevent him from reading about and entering into public debateson esoteric subjects and indulging his old curiosity for vampirism. It was as avampirologist that, in 1985, he accepted an invitation to give a talk in the largestconference centre in the city, Riocentro, which was holding the first Brazilian EsotericFair, an initiative by the guru Kaanda Ananda, the owner of a shop selling esoterica inthe Tijuca district in Rio, who had invited Paulo to open the meeting with a talk onvampirism.When he arrived on the afternoon of Saturday, 19 October, Paulo was greeted by thereporter Nelson Liano, Jr, who had been selected by the Sunday magazine of the Jornaldo Brasil to interview him. Although he was only twenty-four, Liano had worked on themain Rio publications and, like Paulo, had experimented with every type of drug. If"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"there is such a thing as love at first sight between esoterics, this is what happenedbetween Paulo and Liano. Such was their reciprocal delight in each other’s companythat their conversation ended only when Kaanda Ananda told them for the third timethat the auditorium was full and that an impatient public was waiting for Paulo. The twoexchanged phone numbers and took their leave of each other with a warm embrace.While Paulo went into the auditorium, Liano headed off to have a coffee with his friendErnesto Emanuelle Mandarino, the owner of the publishing house Editora Eco.Eco was a small publishing house founded in the 1960s. Although it was unknownin intellectual circles, during its twenty years in existence, it had become a referencepoint for anyone interested in umbanda and candomblé (the Brazilian forms of voodoo),magic, etc. Over coffee with Mandarino, Liano told him that he had just interviewed avampirologist. ‘The guy’s called Paulo Coelho and he trained in vampirism in England.He’s talking at the moment to a packed auditorium of people on the subject. Don’t youthink it might make a book?’Mandarino opened his eyes wide: ‘Vampirism? It sounds like something out of themovies. Would a book like that sell? When he finishes his talk bring him over here tothe stand for a coffee.’Minutes after being introduced to Paulo, Mandarino told him point-blank: ‘If youwrite a book on vampirism, Eco will publish it.’Paulo replied: ‘I’ll do it, if Nelson Liano will write it with me.’Mandarino was astonished: ‘But Nelson told me that you had only just met!’Paulo chuckled: ‘That’s true, but we’re already life-long friends.’The deal was done. The two left, having agreed to write a book entitled ManualPrático do Vampirismo [Practical Manual on Vampirism]. The work was to be arrangedin five parts, the first and fifth to be written by Paulo, the second and fourth by Lianoand the third divided between the two. Paulo and Chris wondered afterwards whether itwouldn’t be better if Shogun published the book, but they were dissuaded from this ideaby Liano, who felt that only a publisher of Eco’s standing would be able to market sucha book, whereas Shogun’s speciality was poetry anthologies. On the assumption that itwould be a best-seller, Paulo demanded changes to Eco’s standard contract. Concernedabout inflation, he asked to receive monthly rather than quarterly accounts. Even thoughLiano was going to write half the book and edit the final text, Paulo asked Mandarino’ssecretary to add this clause at the bottom of the contract: ‘Only the name Paulo Coelhowill appear on the cover, with the words “Edited by Nelson Liano, Jr.” on the title pageunder the title.’In effect, Liano was going to write half the book and edit the whole thing, but wasto appear only as its coordinator (and this only on the inside pages). And, following afinal addendum suggested by Paulo, he was to receive only 5 per cent of the royalties(0.5 per cent of the cover price of the book), the remaining 95 per cent going to Paulo.As though anticipating that this was going to be the goose that laid the golden egg,"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Mandarino patiently accepted his new author’s demands and since Liano also made noobjections, they signed the contract a week after their first meeting. However, onlyLiano handed in his chapters on the agreed date. Saying that he had too much work atShogun, Paulo had not written a single word of his part. Time went on, and still the textdid not appear. It was only after much pressure and when he realized that all deadlineshad passed that Paulo finally handed his text to Eco. At the last minute, perhaps feelingthat he had been unfair to his partner, he allowed the inclusion of Liano’s name on thecover, but in small print, as though he were not the co-author but only an assistant.The launch of the Manual, with waiters serving white wine and canapés, was held inthe elegant Hotel Glória, in front of which, eleven years earlier, Paulo had been seizedby the DOI-Codi. The cover, designed by Chris, bore the title in gothic characters over awell-known photograph of the Hungarian-American actor Béla Lugosi who, in 1931,had become world-famous when he played Count Dracula in the Tod Browning film.The texts covered subjects ranging from the origins of vampirism to the great‘dynasties’ of human bloodsuckers, which were divided into the Romanian, British,German, French and Spanish branches. One chapter explained how to recognize avampire. At social gatherings this could be done by observing certain habits or gestures.For example, if you come across a person with a particular liking for raw orundercooked meat, who is also studious and rather verbose, you should be on yourguard: he could be a true descendant of the Romanian Vlad Tepeş. It would be eveneasier, the Manual explained, to know whether or not you were sleeping with adangerous bloodsucker because vampires don’t move their pelvis during the sexual actand the temperature of their penis is many degrees below that of ordinary mortals.The Manual concealed some even greater mysteries. None of the guests in thelobby of the Hotel Glória could know that, although his name appeared in larger printthan Liano’s on the cover, Paulo had not written a single word, a single syllable, of the144 pages of the Manual. The author never revealed that, under pressure of the deadlineand disinclined to keep his part of the agreement, he had secretly taken on someone elseto write his parts of the book.His choice fell on a strange man from Minas Gerais, Antônio Walter Sena Júnior,who was known in the esoteric world as ‘Toninho Buda’ or ‘Tony Buddha’, a somewhatinappropriate name for a very skinny man who never weighed more than 55 kilos. Hehad graduated in engineering at the Universidade Federal in Juiz de Fora, where he stilllived, and had met Paulo in 1981 during a debate on vampirism at the Colégio Bennettin Rio. He had studied subjects such as magic and the occult, had closely followed thecareer of Paulo and Raul Seixas, and dreamed of resurrecting the old SociedadeAlternativa. He felt greatly honoured at the thought of seeing his name alongside that ofPaulo Coelho in a book and he accepted the task in exchange, as he said later, ‘for theprice of lunch in a cheap restaurant in Copacabana’. He wrote all the chapters that Paulowas supposed to write."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"On 25 April 1986, Toninho Buda was recovering after being run over some weeksearlier. He was shocked to read in a column in the Jornal do Brasil that Paulo Coelhowould be signing his new book, Manual Prático do Vampirismo, that evening in theHotel Glória. He thought it rude that he hadn’t been invited to the launch, but preferredto believe that the invitation had not arrived on time. Still walking with the aid of astick, he decided to go to the launch of a book that was, after all, also his. He went to thebus station, took the bus and, after two hours on the road, arrived in Rio de Janeiro asnight was falling. He crossed the city by taxi and hobbled up the four white marble stepsat the main entrance of the Hotel Glória. It was only then that he realized that he wasthe first to arrive: apart from the employees of the publishing house, who were stackingbooks on a stand, there was no one else there, not even the author.He decided to buy a copy–as well as receiving no invitation he hadn’t even beensent a complimentary copy–and sat in an armchair at one end of the room to enjoy hiscreation in peace. He admired the cover, ran his eyes over the first pages, thefrontispiece, the two flaps, but his name did not appear anywhere in the book, of whichhalf had been entirely written by him. He was about to take a taxi back to the bus stationwhen he saw Paulo enter, smiling, with Chris, Liano and Mandarino.At that moment, he decided that he wasn’t going to waste the journey and so hegave vent to his feelings: ‘Dammit, Paulo! You didn’t even put my name on the book,man, and that was the only thing I asked for! The only thing I asked for, man!’Paulo pretended not to understand, asked to see a copy of the Manual, flippedquickly through it and said regretfully: ‘It’s true, Toninho. They didn’t add your name.But I promise you: I’ll ask for a special stamp to be made and we’ll stamp the whole ofthe first edition. I’ll correct it in the next edition, but with this one, we’ll stamp everybook. Forgive me.’Although deeply upset, Toninho Buda didn’t want to ruin Paulo’s evening and felt itbest to end the conversation there: ‘Paulo, I’m not an idiot. Don’t talk to me about astamp, man. Go off to your launch, where there are loads of people wanting yourautograph. Go on and I’ll just leave.’Toninho swallowed the insult in the name of a higher ambition: to get Paulointerested in reinstituting the Sociedade Alternativa. His strategy was a simple one: touse public debates and popular demonstrations to gain the attention of the media andpublic opinion. Some months earlier, he had written a long letter to Paulo from Juiz deFora suggesting ‘public actions’ by the group, among which he suggested rushing on tothe stage of the first international rock concert in Rio on the night when stars such asWhitesnake, Ozzy Osbourne, the Scorpions and AC/DC were performing. Toninho’splan was to seize the microphone and start talking about the Sociedade Alternativa:‘This will depend almost entirely on you and your contacts in Rio. I’m prepared to gothere myself. If you agree, you can start to work on things, but please don’t forget tokeep me informed as to how it’s going.’"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"In January 1986, some months after the book signing, the threesome had taken partin an event in Rio. They decided to use a protest by inhabitants of the South Zoneagainst the decision of the Prefecture to close a public park in order to announce thelaunch of a newspaper, Sociedade Alternativa, the first draft of which had been designedentirely by Toninho. It was he who enrolled with the organizers of the demonstration inorder to get his message heard. As soon as his name was called, he went up to theimprovised rostrum in suit and tie and in front of the television cameras began to readwhat he had entitled ‘Manifesto Number 11’. It was an entire page of statements such as‘Free space, everyone should occupy their space’ ‘Time is free, everyone has to live intheir time’ and ‘The artistic class no longer exists: we are all writers, housewives,bosses and employees, radicals and conservatives, wise and mad’. It wasn’t the contentthat mattered though, but the manner of his performance. As Toninho Buda read outeach sentence, paragraph or thought, Chris carefully and silently cut off a piece of hisclothing: first his tie, then a sleeve of his suit, then a leg of his trousers, then anothersleeve, a collar, another sleeve...When he pronounced the final sentence (somethinglike ‘The great miracle will no longer be being able to walk on water, but being able towalk on the earth’) he was completely naked, without a square centimetre of cloth onhis body.That night, when they were all celebrating the repercussions of their ‘public action’in the park, Paulo was still muttering about the need to do something even morescandalous, with greater impact. However, Chris and Paulo were flabbergasted whenToninho told them that what he hoped to do would, in his words, ‘leave the SociedadeAlternativa engraved for ever in the memory of millions of Brazilians’: neither morenor less than blowing the head off the statue of Christ the Redeemer. He explained theplan to explode the monument’s 3.75-metre-high, 30-ton head, a monument which, in2007, would be named one of the seven new wonders of the modern world. Any normalperson would have thrown such a madman out of the house, but Paulo didn’t do that. Onthe contrary, he simply said: ‘Go ahead.’This was what Toninho wanted to hear. ‘Just imagine the population of Rio deJaneiro waking up one morning and seeing Christ there, without his head and with thatgreat mound of twisted iron struts sticking out of his neck towards the indigo sky!Think of the Pope’s edict for making amends, the crowds climbing up Corcovadolooking for pieces to keep as a relic. Imagine that! The Church collecting tithes for themiracle of its reconstruction! That’s when we would go in singing “Viva, Viva, Viva aSociedade Alternativa!” and distributing the first edition of our newspaper with the hotnews on the dreadful episode...’This was a heresy too far, particularly for someone who was in the process ofreconciliation with the Church, and Paulo preferred to bring the conversation to a closeand never return to the subject. As Toninho would only find out months later, Paulo wasvery close to being admitted as a Master of RAM, the religious order to which Jean had"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"introduced him. His first failed attempt to acquire this rank in the secret organizationhad occurred in January that year. Taking advantage of a business trip to Brazil, Jeanhad appointed 2 January 1986 as the date for a secret ceremony during which Paulowould receive a sword, the symbol of his ordination as a Master. The site for this was tobe the summit of one of the mountains in Mantiqueira, on the frontier between MinasGerais and Rio de Janeiro, next to one of the highest points in Brazil, the peak ofAgulhas Negras. As well as Jean and Paulo, Chris, a hired guide and another man whowas to be initiated into the order were also to be there. The sole instruction Paulo hadreceived was to take with him the old sword that he had been using for years in hisesoteric exercises.As Paulo himself describes in the prologue to The Pilgrimage, they all met around abonfire and the ceremony began when Jean pointed a brand-new sword, which he hadnot yet removed from its sheath, towards the sky, saying: ‘And now before the sacredcountenance of RAM, you must touch with your hands the Word of Life and acquiresuch power as you need to become witness to that Word throughout the world!’ Afterdigging a long, shallow hole with his bare hands, Paulo received from Chris his oldsword, which was to be buried there, and in a tremulous voice, he pronounced the wordsof the ritual. As he finished, he saw that Jean was placing the new sword on top of thehole.He then goes on to say that they were all standing with their arms outstretchedwhen something happened. ‘The Master, invoking his power, created a strange light thatsurrounded us; it didn’t illuminate, but it was clearly visible, and it caused the figuresof those who were there to take on a colour that was different from the yellowish tingecast by the fire.’ The high point, not just of the ceremony but of the whole long day, wasapproaching. Still not believing what he was experiencing, he heard the words Jean wassaying while he made a slight cut on his forehead with the point of the blade of the newsword: ‘By the power and the love of RAM, I anoint you Master and Knight of theOrder, now and for all the days of your life. R for Rigour, A for Adoration, and M forMercy; R for regnum, A for agnus, and M for mundi. Let not your sword remain long inits scabbard, lest it rust. And when you draw your sword, it must never be replacedwithout having performed an act of goodness, opened a path or tasted the blood of anenemy.’ Paulo was not shaking quite so much and, for the first time since he hadarrived, he felt relief. When his hand touched the sword that Jean had laid down on theground, he would finally be a magus.At that moment, someone stepped roughly on the fingers of his right hand, which hehad just reached out to touch the sword. He looked up and saw that the foot that hadalmost maimed him was Jean’s. Furious, the Frenchman snatched up the sword,replaced it in its scabbard and gave it to Chris. Paulo realized then that the strange lighthad disappeared and that Jean was looking at him coldly, saying: ‘You should haverefused the sword. If you had done so, it would have been given to you, because you"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"would have shown that your heart was pure. But just as I feared, at the suprememoment, you stumbled and fell. Because of your avidity you will now have to seekagain for your sword. And because of your pride you will have to seek it among simplepeople. Because of your fascination with miracles, you will have to struggle torecapture what was about to be given to you so generously.’The ceremony ended miserably. Alone in the car on the return to Rio de Janeiro,Paulo and Chris remained silent for a long time, until Paulo was unable to restrain hiscuriosity and asked her what the Master had said to her. Chris tried to reassure him,saying that she was sure he would get the sword back. She had received preciseinstructions from Jean as to where she was to hide the sword so that Paulo could try toregain it.Still more troubled, he wanted to know what place had been chosen as the hidingplace, but she was unable to reply precisely: ‘He didn’t explain very well. He just saidthat you should look on the map of Spain for a medieval route known as the Road toSantiago.’"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23The road to SantiagoWHEN HE ENQUIRED AT TRAVEL AGENCIES, Paulo discovered that in 1986, there washardly any interest in the so-called Road to Santiago. Each year, fewer than 400pilgrims ventured along the 700 inhospitable kilometres of the mystical route betweenSt-Jean-Pied-de-Port, in the south of France, and the cathedral in Santiago deCompostela, the capital of Galicia, in the northwest of Spain. From the first millenniumof Christianity onwards, this road had been taken by pilgrims seeking the supposedtomb of the Apostle James. All Paulo needed to do was to pluck up the courage andleave. Instead, he handed over the day-to-day management of Shogun to Chris, while hespent his days at home filling pages and pages of diaries with a constant lament: ‘Ihaven’t felt this angry for a long time. I’m not angry at Jesus, but at myself for nothaving sufficient willpower to realize my dreams.’He felt that he lacked the strength he needed and frequently said that he felt likebecoming an atheist. However, he never lost sight of the commitment he had made toJean. Since, though, he seemed determined to put off the trip for ever, it fell to Chris totake the initiative. Without telling him, at the end of July she went to a travel agency,bought two tickets and came home to announce: ‘We’re going to Madrid.’He tried to put off their departure yet again, saying that the publishing housecouldn’t function on its own and that the business about him finding the sword, whichChris was to hide somewhere on a 700-kilometre-long road, seemed utter madness:‘Has my Master set me an impossible task, do you think?’Chris, however, was determined: ‘You’ve done nothing for the last seven months.It’s time to fulfil your commitment.’So at the beginning of August 1986, they landed in Barajas international airport inMadrid, where skinny Antônio Walter Sena Júnior, the same Toninho Buda who haddreamed of blowing off the head of Christ the Redeemer, was waiting for them.Once Paulo had made the decision to follow the Road to Santiago, he had taken onToninho as his assistant and, since then, had started to refer to him as ‘slave’. Toninhohad barely recovered from his frustration over the Manual Prático do Vampirismo andwas setting up a macrobiotic restaurant in Juiz de Fora when he received Paulo’sproposal, in which Paulo made it clear that this wasn’t an invitation to travel togetherbut an employment contract.When he learned the details of the proposal over the telephone, Toninho had asurreal conversation with his friend–surreal because this was to be paid slavery."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"‘But what you’re suggesting is slavery!’‘Exactly. I want to know if you’ll agree to be my slave for the two months I’ll be inSpain.’‘But what am I going to do there? I haven’t got a penny to my name, I’ve neverbeen outside Brazil, I’ve never been on a plane.’‘Don’t worry about money. I’ll pay your fare and give you a monthly salary of27,000 pesetas.’‘How much is that in dollars?’‘It must be about US$200, which is a fortune if you take into account that Spain isthe cheapest country in Europe. Do you accept?’Aged thirty-six, single and with no responsibilities, Toninho saw no reason torefuse: after all, it wasn’t every day that someone invited him to go to Europe,regardless of what he would have to do when he got there. And if things didn’t work out,all he had to do was take the plane back. But it was only when he arrived in Rio, withhis bags packed, and read the contract drawn up by Paulo that he discovered that thingswere not quite like that. In the first place, while Paulo and Chris were taking an Iberiaflight that included a free night in a hotel, Paulo had bought him a much cheaper flighton the ill-fated Linhas Aéreas Paraguaias. Apart from the risks involved in flying with acompany that was hardly a world champion in safety, he had to go to Asunción, inParaguay, in order to get the plane to Madrid. In addition, the ticket could not beexchanged and could be used only on the specified dates, which meant that, whateverhappened, he could not return to Brazil until the beginning of October, two monthslater. The contract, grown yellow over time and lost at the bottom of a trunk in Rio deJaneiro, shows how draconian were the conditions Paulo imposed on his slave, who isreferred to here as ‘Tony’:Agreements1 If Tony sleeps in my room, he will only do so when it is time to sleep, since Iwill be working there day and night.2 Tony will receive an allowance of US$200 a month which will be reimbursedto him when he returns to Rio, but this is not obligatory.3 Should my room or apartment be occupied by someone else, Tony will sleepelsewhere at his own expense.4 Any visits I want to make and for which I require Tony’s company will be atmy expense.5 Tony will not make the journey with me and Chris. He will wait for us inMadrid.6 Tony has been advised of the following items:6.1 That the air ticket does not allow him to change the date of his return;6.2 That it is illegal for him to work in Spain;"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"6.3 That, apart from his monthly allowance of US$200, he will have to findmoney himself;6.4 That if he changes his return date he will have to pay the equivalent of anormal fare (US$2080) to be discounted from the US dollars already paidfor the non-refundable ticket.1 August 1986Antônio Walter Sena JúniorPaulo CoelhoOn reading these monstrous requirements, Toninho Buda considered returning to MinasGerais, but the desire to know Europe won out and so he had no alternative but to signthe agreement. Since their respective flight times did not coincide, he took a flight theday before Paulo and Chris on a journey that started badly. On arriving in Madrid,without knowing a word of Spanish, he spent three hours trying to explain to theauthorities how he was planning to stay sixty days in Spain with the four 10-dollar notesin his wallet. He found himself in the humiliating position of being undressed andinterrogated before, finally, being allowed to go. On the following day, Tuesday, 5August, he was once again at Barajas airport, awaiting the arrival of his boss. Toninhohad found somewhere to stay with an old blind woman who hated Brazil (a ‘country fullof shameless hussies’, she would mutter) and who would lock the front door at eleven atnight, after which whoever was still out in the street slept in the street. The onlyadvantage of Doña Cristina Belerano’s boarding house was the price–a paltry 600pesetas (US$7 in today’s terms) a day, which included a modest breakfast. Chris andPaulo spent only the first night together in Madrid: the following day Chris rented a carand went off to hide Paulo’s sword in the place indicated by Jean.It was suffocatingly hot in the Spanish capital on 7 August 1986, when Paulo leftthe city in a hired car. He drove about 450 kilometres north, crossed the frontier withFrance and left the car at a branch of the hire firm in Pau, where he spent two nights. Onthe Sunday morning, 10 August, he took a train to the Pyrenees and there wrote whatwas to be the final note in his diary before returning from his pilgrimage:11h57–S.-Jean-Pied-de-PortA fiesta in town. Basque music in the distance.Immediately below, on the same page, was a stamp on which one can read aninscription in Latin–‘St. Joannes Pedis Portus’–beside which there is a handwritten notein French signed by someone called ‘J.’, whose surname looks something like ‘Relul’ or‘Ellul’:"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"Saint-Jean-Pied-de-PortBasse-NavarreLe 10 Août 1986J.........Could this initial J be for Jean? As is usually the case whenever someone tries to crossthe frontier of his mystical world by asking too many questions, Paulo Coelho neitherconfirms nor denies this. Everything indicates that Jean was the person in St-Jean-Pied-de-Port (presumably, as the official representative of the religious order RAM) toensure that his disciple really was beginning the ordeal imposed on him.Paulo’s pilgrimage would end in the Spanish city of Cebrero, where he found thesword and broke off his journey. An episode in which a taxi driver claimed that Paulohad in fact made the journey in the back of his comfortable, air-conditioned Citroën,and was proved by a Japanese television company to have been lying, led Paulo toinclude in the preface to the subsequent editions of The Pilgrimage a short piece inwhich he invites the reader to believe whichever version he prefers, thus only increasingthe mystery surrounding the journey:I’ve listened to all kinds of theories about my pilgrimage, from me doing itentirely by taxi (imagine the cost!) to my having secret help from certaininitiating societies (imagine the confusion!).My readers don’t need to be sure whether or not I made the pilgrimage: thatway they will seek a personal experience and not the one I experienced (ordidn’t).I made the pilgrimage just once–and even then I didn’t do the whole thing.I finished in Cebrero and took a bus to Santiago de Compostela. I often think ofthe irony: the best-known text on the Road at the end of this millennium waswritten by someone who didn’t follow it right to the end.The most important and mysterious moment of the whole journey, which is not revealeduntil the end of the book, occurred when Paulo was nearing Cebrero, some 150kilometres from Santiago. At the side of the road, he came across a solitary lamb, stillunsteady on its feet. He began to follow the animal, which plunged off into theundergrowth until it reached a little old church built beside a small cemetery at theentrance to the town, as he describes in the book:The chapel was completely lit when I came to its door. [...] The lamb slippedinto one of the pews, and I looked to the front of the chapel. Standing before"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"the altar, smiling–and perhaps a bit relieved–was the Master: with my sword inhis hand.I stopped, and he came toward me, passing me by and going outside. Ifollowed him. In front of the chapel, looking up at the dark sky, he unsheathedmy sword and told me to grasp its hilt with him. He pointed the blade upwardand said the sacred Psalm of those who travel far to achieve victory:‘A thousand fall at your side and ten thousand to your right, but you willnot be touched. No evil will befall you, no curse will fall upon your tent; yourangels will be given orders regarding you, to protect you along your everyway.’I knelt, and as he touched the blade to my shoulders, he said:‘Trample the lion and the serpent. The lion cub and the dragon will makeshoes for your feet.’Paulo tells how at the exact moment when Jean finished speaking, a heavy summershower began to fall. ‘I looked about for the lamb, but he had disappeared,’ he wrote,‘but that did not matter: the Water of Life fell from the sky and caused the blade of mysword to glisten.’ Like a child celebrating some form of rebirth, Paulo returned toMadrid, moved into a pleasant furnished flat in the elegant Alonso Martínez district,and gave himself over body and soul to the city’s vibrant lifestyle. Until October, hecould count on the assistance of Toninho Buda–whom he referred to in his diary as ‘theslave’, or simply ‘the sl.’–but he soon realized that he had chosen the wrong man to behis servant. While Paulo had become a sybarite eager to drain Madrid’s night-life to thelast drop, Toninho turned out to be a radical vegetarian who would eat only minuteportions of macrobiotic food and drink no alcohol. Nor could he spend his eveningswith his boss, since he had to be back at Doña Cristina’s boarding house by eleven,when the night in Madrid had barely begun. He also complained with increasingfrequency that his salary was not enough to live on. On one such occasion, they had abitter argument.‘Paulo, the money isn’t enough even for me to buy food.’‘I think you’d better read our contract again. It’s says there that if the pay isn’tenough, then you have to earn some extra money yourself.’‘But Paulo, the contract also says that it’s forbidden for foreigners to work here inSpain!’‘Don’t be so stupid, slave. Other people manage to get by. It’s not as if you werecrippled or anything, so do something!’Toninho had no option. When he was down to his last penny, he took his guitar,which he had brought with him from Brazil, chose a busy underground station, sat onthe floor and began to sing Brazilian songs. Beside him was a cap waiting for the coinsand, more rarely, notes thrown in by passers-by. He could never stay long in the same"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"place before being moved on, but an hour’s singing would usually bring in 800–1,000pesetas (US$9–11), which was enough to buy a plate of food and pay for his board andlodging. Another way of earning money was by using his rudimentary knowledge ofAsian massage, in particular shiatsu, which wouldn’t require him to speak Spanish orany other language. The cost of putting an advertisement in one of the Madridnewspapers was prohibitive, but with the help of a friend, he managed to find a kindsoul willing to print a number of cards on which he offered to perform therapeuticmassage for ‘back, muscular pain, insomnia, tiredness, stress, etc’. On the day when thecards were ready, he stuck a copy in his diary and wrote above it:Thursday, 25 Sep 86I woke late, but went for a run in the Retiro Park. I had diarrhoea when I gotback and felt very weak. Paulo phoned me, and I told him that it was going totake a miracle for them to keep me here...I had the business card made to handit out in strategic places in Madrid, but I’m the one who needs a massage! Ineed to get stronger. The tension is killing me.Given Paulo’s indifference to the sufferings of his ‘slave’, Toninho returned to Brazil atthe beginning of October without saying goodbye.All Paulo wanted to do was enjoy himself. He would lunch and dine in goodrestaurants, he would go to cinemas and museums, and he found himself giving way totwo new passions: bullfights and pinball machines. With the latter, he would usuallystop playing only once he had broken the record set by the previous player. He graduallybecame such an aficionado of bullfights that he would travel for hours by train to see aparticular fighter in action. If there were no bullfights, he would spend his afternoonsstanding in bars full of adolescents, eyes glued to the illuminated screen of the pinballmachine. He even joined a course to learn how to play the castanets.It did not take long, though, for him to fall once more into depression. He hadUS$300,000 in the bank and five apartments bringing in a regular income, he was in astable relationship and he had just received the sword of a Master or Magus, but he wasstill unhappy. In spite of the busy life he was leading, he found time to fill more thanfive hundred pages of his diary between September and January, when he was due toreturn to Brazil. Most of these pages repeated for the umpteenth time the monotonouscomplaint he had been making for the last twenty years, which had now become atearful mantra: ‘I’m still not an established writer.’At the end of October, Chris came to Madrid for a few weeks and rubbed more saltinto his wounds. One day, when Paulo was saying how prolific Picasso was, she said:‘Look, Paulo, you have as much talent as he has, but since we got together six years ago,you haven’t produced anything. I’ve given and I’ll continue to give you all the support"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"you need. But you have to have a concrete objective and pursue it tenaciously. That’sthe only way you’ll get where you want to be.’When Chris returned to Brazil at the beginning of December, Paulo was in an evenworse mental state than before. He was lamenting the fact that he had lost the ability totell ‘even stories about myself or my life’. He found his diary ‘boring, mediocre andempty’, but eventually recognized that, if he did, this was his own fault: ‘I haven’t evenwritten here about the Road to Santiago. Sometimes I think about killing myselfbecause I’m so terrified of things, but I have faith in God that I shall never do that. Itwould be exchanging one fear for a greater fear. I’ve got to get away from the idea thatwriting a book would be an important thing to do in Madrid. Perhaps I could dictate abook to someone.’In the middle of December, Chris phoned to say that she could no longer standworking with Pedro: ‘Paulo, your father is being very difficult. I need you to come backhere straight away.’Pedro Queima Coelho did not agree with the expenses that the publishing houseincurred in advertising, and this created permanent friction between him and Chris. Thephone call was an ultimatum for Paulo to start the countdown and think about returning,with or without his book. He handed over this final responsibility to God, begging in hisdiary for the Creator to give him a sign when the time came to start writing.Some days later, one icy Tuesday morning, he left early to go for a walk in theRetiro Park. When he returned home, he went straight to his diary and wrote: ‘I hadhardly gone any distance when I saw the particular sign I had asked God for: a pigeonfeather. The time has come for me to give myself entirely to that book.’In biographies and on official websites, The Pilgrimage is described as having beenwritten in Rio during the Carnival of 1987, but there are clear indications in the author’sdiary that he began to write the first lines of the book when he was still in Spain. A dayafter receiving what he believes to have been a sign from heaven he wrote:15/12–I can’t write this book as though it were just any book. I can’t write thisbook just to pass the time, or to justify my life and/or my idleness. I have towrite this book as though it were the most important thing in my life. Becausethis book is the beginning of something very important. It’s the beginning ofmy work of indoctrination in RAM and that is what I must devote myself tofrom now on.18/12–I wrote for an hour and a half. The text came easily, but there arelots of things missing. It seemed very implausible, very Castaneda. Using thefirst person worries me. Another alternative would be an actual diary. PerhapsI’ll try that tomorrow. I think the first scene is good, so I can make variationson that theme until I find the right approach."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"The miracle was apparently taking place."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24The AlchemistPAULO’S FIRST MOVE when he returned to Brazil was to persuade his father to leaveShogun so that Chris could work in peace, which he managed to do without causing anyresentment. During his absence, she had dealt very competently with the firm’sbusiness, and knowing that Chris was looking after the firm as well as or even betterthan he could was a further inducement for Paulo to dedicate himself entirely to thebook. He was still full of doubts, though. Was he really just writing a book about hispilgrimage? Weren’t there enough books on that topic? Why not abandon the idea andtry writing something else, such as a Manual of Practical Magic? And whatever thesubject, should the book be published by Shogun or given to Eco, as had been the casewith Manual Pratico do Vampirismo?These uncertainties lasted until 3 March 1987, a Tuesday during Carnival. That dayPaulo sat down in front of his typewriter, determined to leave the apartment only whenhe had put the final full stop on the last page of The Pilgrimage. He worked freneticallyfor twenty-one days, during which time he did not set foot outside the house, getting upfrom his chair only to eat, sleep and go to the toilet. When Chris arrived home on thetwenty-fourth, Paulo had a package in front of him containing 200 pages ready to besent to the printer. The decision to have Shogun publish it was growing in his mind andhe even put some small classified ads in the Saturday edition of Jornal do Brasilannouncing: ‘It’s on its way! The Pilgrimage–Editora Shogun.’The person who once again dissuaded him from the idea of being at once author andpublisher was the journalist Nelson Liano, Jr, who advised him to knock on ErnestMandarino’s door. Paulo thought about it for a few days, and it wasn’t until mid-Aprilthat he signed the contract for the first edition of O Diário de um Mago, or ThePilgrimage, standing at the counter of a small bar next to the publisher’s office in RuaMarquês de Pombal.The contract contains some odd things. First, Paulo demanded that, instead of theusual five-or seven-year contract, he should have a contract that would be renewed withevery edition (the first had a print run of 3,000 copies). He did not, as he had withManual Prático do Vampirismo, ask for monthly rather than quarterly accounts, butaccepted what he was offered, even though inflation in Brazil had reached almost 1 percent a day. The other strange thing is that at the foot of the contract the author put in anapparently meaningless addendum–which would, however, prove to be prophetic: ‘Oncethe book has sold 1,000 (one thousand) copies, the publisher will be responsible for the"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"costs of producing the book in Spanish and English.’ If, among his gifts, Paulo had hadthe ability to predict the future, he could have taken the opportunity to make itMandarino’s responsibility to produce versions not only in English and Spanish but alsoin the other forty-four languages into which The Pilgrimage would subsequently betranslated, among them Albanian, Estonian, Farsi, Hebrew, Hindi, Malay and Marathi.Although sales got off to a very slow start, they soon overtook all of Eco’s othertitles. Years later, when he was retired and living in Petrópolis, 70 kilometres from Riode Janeiro, Ernesto Mandarino was to recall how much of this success was due to avirtue that few authors possess–a desire to publicize the book: ‘Authors would leave thefinished manuscript with the publisher and do nothing to publicize their work. Paulo notonly appeared in all the media, newspapers, radio and television, but gave talks on thebook wherever he was asked.’On the advice of his friend the journalist Joaquim Ferreira dos Santos, Paulo tookan initiative rare even among established authors: at his own expense he employed thetwenty-year-old journalist Andréa Cals to work exclusively on publicizing the book inthe media. The salary was modest–8,000 cruzados a month, the equivalent in 1987 ofabout US$400–but he offered a tempting bonus. Should the book sell 20,000 copies bythe end of 1987, Andréa would get a return flight from Rio to Miami. The contract alsoincluded the publicity for an exhibition of art by Chris entitled ‘Tarô’, and if all twenty-two works on show were sold before the exhibition closed, Andréa would earn a further5,000 cruzados. Meanwhile, Paulo and Chris printed flyers about The Pilgrimage, whichthey themselves handed out nightly in cinema, theatre and stadium queues.All this was an attempt to make up for the resistance of large media companies togive space to something as specific as The Pilgrimage–which seemed to be of interestonly to the shrinking underground press. Andréa recalls trying in vain to get a copy ofThe Pilgrimage included in Mandala, a TV soap being shown by Globo and whosetheme was in some ways similar to that of the book, but it was down to her hard workthat the book got its first mention in one of the major newspapers. Beside the very briefmention in the Jornal do Brasil was a photo of the author who, at Joaquim’s suggestion,was wearing a black cape and holding a sword. The picture caught the attention of theproducers of Sem Censura, a chat show that went out every afternoon on the nationaltelevision network Educativa, to which Paulo was invited.In response to a question from the presenter, Lúcia Leme, and in front of millionsof television viewers, Paulo revealed for the first time in public the secret that had beenknown only to a few friends and his diary: yes, he was a magus and among his manypowers was that of making it rain. The strategy worked. The reporter Regina Guerra,from the newspaper O Globo, saw the programme and suggested to her boss aninterview with this new individual on the Rio cultural scene: the writer who could makeit rain. Her boss thought it all complete nonsense, but when his young reporterpersisted, he gave in. The result was that, on 3 August, the cultural section of the"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"newspaper devoted its entire front page to Paulo Coelho, who was given the title of ‘theCastaneda of Copacabana’. In a sequence of photos, he appears among the leaves of hisgarden wearing the same black cloak and dark glasses and holding a sword. The textpreceding the interview seems made to order for someone claiming to have supernaturalpowers:The thick walls of the old building mean that the apartment is very quiet, inspite of the fact that it’s in one of the noisiest parts of the city–Copacabana,Posto Quatro. One of the bedrooms acts as a study and opens on to a miniatureforest, a tangle of bushes, climbing shrubs and ferns. To the question–‘Are youa magus?’ Paulo Coelho, who has just launched The Pilgrimage, his fifth book,replies with another: ‘Is it windy outside?’A glance at the dense leaves is enough to make one shake one’s head andmurmur a casual ‘No’, implying that it really doesn’t matter if there’s a breezeoutside or not: ‘Right, take a look’–he remains as he was, seated on a cushionand leaning against another, doing nothing.First, the tip of the highest leaf of a palm tree starts to sway gently. In thenext instant, the whole plant moves, as does all the vegetation around. Thebamboo curtain in the corridor sways and clicks, the reporter’s notes fly off herclipboard. After one or two minutes, the wind stops as suddenly as it began.There are a few leaves on the carpet and a question: was it coincidence or is hereally a magus who knows how to summon up the wind? Read on and find outmore.Apart from O Globo, the only other coverage the rain-making author received was inPasquim and the magazine Manchete. He was always friendly and receptive towardsjournalists, posing in a yoga position and allowing himself to be photographed behindsmoking test tubes and putting on or removing his cloak and sword according to thedemands of his clients. The barriers began to fall. His telephone number was soon in thediaries of social columnists, among them his friend Hildegard Angel, and he was oftenreported as having been seen dining in such-and-such a restaurant or leaving such-and-such a theatre. For the first time Paulo could feel the wind of fame in his face–something he had never experienced even at the height of his musical success, since, atthe time, the star of the partnership was Raul Seixas. This media exposure did increasethe sales of the book, but The Pilgrimage still seemed far from becoming a best-seller.In order to try and capitalize on his new-found ‘almost-fame’, as he himself calledit, Paulo and the astrologer Cláudia Castelo Branco, who had written the preface to ThePilgrimage, joined forces with the specialist travel firm Itatiaia Turismo to organize aspiritual package holiday named ‘The Three Sacred Roads’, which were to be"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Christianity, Judaism and Islam. Those interested would be guided by Paulo andCláudia on a journey that would start in Madrid and end in Santiago de Compostela, viaa zigzag route through Egypt (Cairo and Luxor), Israel (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv),France (Lourdes) and then back to Spain (Pamplona, Logroño, Burgos, León, Ponferradaand Lugo). Whether it was the fault of the dreadful advertisement published in thenewspapers (which did not even say how long the excursion would last) or the highprice of the package (US$2,800), they received not a single enquiry. However, althoughit produced no results, the project had cost them both time and money, and in order topay them for their work, the agency gave them a half-price trip to the Middle East, oneof the places suggested for the failed magical mystery tour.Paulo and Cláudia set off on 26 September with Paula, Chris’s mother, but as soonas they arrived in Cairo, he decided to continue alone with Paula. On their second day inthe Egyptian capital, he hired a guide named Hassan and asked him to take them to theMoqattam district, in the southwest of the city, so that he could visit the Copticmonastery of St Simon the Shoemaker. From there they crossed the city by taxi, andnight was falling when, after driving through an enormous slum, they reached the sandyfringe of the largest desert on the planet, the Sahara, a few hundred metres from theSphinx and the famous pyramids of Cheops, Chephren and Mykerinos. They left the taxiand continued their journey to the pyramids on horseback (Paulo was frightened offalling off a camel, the only other available means of transport from there on). Whenthey drew near, Paulo decided to proceed on foot, while Hassan looked after the horsesand read the Koran. Paulo says that, near one of the illuminated monuments, he saw awoman in the middle of the desert wearing a chador and carrying a clay pot on hershoulder. This, according to him, was very different from what had occurred in Dachau.‘A vision is something that you see and an apparition is something almost physical,’ heexplained later. ‘What happened in Cairo was an apparition.’ Although used to suchphenomena, he found what he had seen strange. He looked at the endless stretch of sandsurrounding him on that moonlit night and saw no one else apart from Hassan, who wasstill reciting sacred verses. As the shape approached Paulo, it disappeared asmysteriously as it had appeared. However, it left such a strong impression that, monthslater, he could reconstruct the apparition in detail when describing it in his second book.When he flew back to Brazil some weeks later, he received the first major newsregarding his career while still on the plane. The stewardess handed him a copy of OGlobo from the Saturday before, and he placed the folded newspaper on his lap, closedhis eyes, meditated for a moment and only then opened the paper at the arts section–andthere was The Pilgrimage on that week’s best-sellers’ list. Before the end of the year, hewould sign contracts for five new editions of the book, the sales of which went on toexceed 12,000 copies. This success encouraged him to enter The Pilgrimage for thePrêmio Instituto Nacional do Livro, an award supported by the Ministry of Educationfor published novels. The jury that year was to meet in Vitória, the capital of Espírito"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Santo, and its members were the poet Ivan Junqueira, the writer Roberto Almada, andthe journalist Carlos Herculano Lopes. The Pilgrimage didn’t even appear on the list offinalists and only got Junqueira’s vote. ‘The book was unusual for us, because it mixedreality with fantasy,’ the poet recalled later. ‘For me personally it was interesting in thatI like travel literature very much and also this kind of half-ghost-story.’Immediately after the results were announced, Paulo suffered yet anotherdisappointment. The magazine Veja had published a long report on the boom in esotericbooks in Brazil and made no mention of The Pilgrimage. This was such a hard blow thatPaulo once again thought of giving up his career as a writer. ‘Today I seriously thoughtof abandoning everything and retiring,’ he wrote in his diary. Weeks later, however, heseemed to have recovered from those two setbacks and returned to the I Ching, alreadywith an idea for a new book. He wrote a question in his diary: ‘What should I do tomake my next book sell 100,000 copies?’ He threw the three coins on the table andstared in delight at the result. Usually vague and metaphorical in its responses, theChinese oracle was, according to Paulo, astonishingly clear: ‘The great man brings goodluck.’That piece of good luck–the new book–was already in his head. The next work byPaulo Coelho was to be based on a Persian fable that had also inspired the Borges story‘Tale of the Two Dreamers’, published in 1935 in A Universal History of Infamy. It isthe tale of Santiago, a shepherd who, after dreaming repeatedly of a treasure hiddennear the Egyptian pyramids, resolves to leave the village where he was born in search ofwhat the author calls a ‘personal legend’. On the journey to Egypt Santiago meetsvarious characters, among them an alchemist, and at each meeting he learns a newlesson. At the end of his pilgrimage he discovers that the object of his search was in thevery village he had left. Paulo had also chosen the title: O Alquimista, or The Alchemist.It’s odd to think that a book that would become one of the greatest best-sellers of alltime–at the beginning of 2000 it had sold more than 35 million copies–started out as aplay that would combine Shakespeare and the Brazilian humourist Chico Anysio, as theauthor recorded in his diary in January 1987:Menescal and [the actor] Perry [Salles] called me asking me to write a play forone actor alone on the stage. By coincidence, I was watching Duel on video,which is a film about a man alone.I had an idea: a large laboratory in which an old man, an alchemist, issearching for the philosopher’s stone, for wisdom. He wants to discover whatman can achieve through inspiration. The alchemist (perhaps that would be agood title) recites texts by Shakespeare and by Chico Anysio. He will performsongs and hold dialogues with himself, playing more than one character. Hecould be an alchemist or a vampire. I know through personal experience thatvampires really excite the human imagination, and it’s some time since I’ve"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"seen anything that combines horror and humour on the stage.But, like Faust, the alchemist realizes that knowledge lies not in books butin people–and the people are in the audience. In order to get them in the mood,he gets them to chant or sing something all together. Perry would be thealchemist, in the role of the discoverer. Again, I stress that this must all bedone with great good humour.This sketch never became a play, but went on to become a novel. Paulo knew the storyso intimately that when it came to writing the book, it took him only two weeks toproduce 200 pages. At the beginning was a dedication to Jean, to whom Paulo gave theprivilege of being the first to read the original manuscript:For J.,An alchemist who knows and uses the secrets of the Great Work.When The Alchemist was ready for publication in June 1988, sales of The Pilgrimagehad exceeded 40,000 copies and it had spent nineteen uninterrupted weeks in the mainbest-seller lists of the Brazilian press. The sublime indifference with which the mediahad treated it gave a special savour to Paulo’s success, a success that was entirely downto the book itself and to the guerrilla warfare that Paulo, Chris and Andréa Cals hadengaged in to publicize it. The I Ching, as interpreted by Paulo, recommended that herenew his contract with Andréa, but since she had taken on other work and he requiredher to devote herself entirely to him, her responsibilities were transferred to Chris.She and Paulo adopted the same tactics for The Alchemist as had been used for thefirst book: the couple once again distributed flyers at the doors of theatres, bars andcinemas, visited bookshops and presented booksellers with signed copies. With hisexperience of the record industry, Paulo brought to the literary world a somewhatreprehensible practice–the jabaculê, a payment made to radio stations to encouragethem to make favourable comments about a record, or in this case, a book. Evidence ofthis can be found in spreadsheets–certificados de irradiação–sent to him by O PovoAM-FM, the most popular radio station in Fortaleza, Ceará. These show that during theentire second half of July, The Alchemist was mentioned three times a day inprogrammes presented by Carlos Augusto, Renan França and Ronaldo César, who were,at the time, the station’s most popular presenters.Paulo and Chris knew that they were in a world where anything goes–from sendingsigned copies to the grandees of the Brazilian media to becoming a full-time speaker,albeit unpaid. He had eight themes for organizers of talks to choose from: ‘The SacredPaths of Antiquity’ ‘The Dawn of Magic’ ‘The Practices of RAM’ ‘The Philosophy andPractice of the Occult Tradition’ ‘The Esoteric Tradition and the Practices of RAM’"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"‘The Growth of the Esoteric’ ‘Magic and Power’ and ‘Ways of Teaching and Learning’.At the end of each session, the audience could buy signed copies of The Pilgrimage andThe Alchemist, and it was, apparently, very easy to get people to come and listen to him.Paulo’s diary at the time shows that he spoke frequently at theatres and universities, aswell as in country hotels and even people’s homes.However, this campaign produced slow results and the effects on sales of TheAlchemist took time to appear. Six weeks after its launch, a few thousand copies hadbeen sold–a vast number in a country like Brazil, it’s true, but nothing when comparedwith the success of The Pilgrimage and far fewer than he had planned: ‘Up to now’, hewrote, ‘the book hasn’t reached 10 per cent of the goal I set myself. I think what thisbook needs is a miracle. I spend all day by the telephone, which refuses to ring. Why thehell doesn’t some journalist call me saying that he liked my book? My work is greaterthan my obsessions, my words, my feelings. For its sake I humiliate myself, I sin, Ihope, I despair.’With The Pilgrimage still high in the best-seller lists and The Alchemist heading inthe same direction, it had become impossible to ignore the author. A great silence hadgreeted the publication of the first book, but the launch of The Alchemist was precededby full-page articles in all the main Brazilian newspapers. And because most of thepress had totally ignored The Pilgrimage on its publication, they felt obliged torediscover it following the success of The Alchemist. However, most restrictedthemselves to printing an article on the author and a summary of the story. Thejournalist and critic Antônio Gonçalves Filho, in Folha de São Paulo, was the first topublish a proper review. He commented only that The Alchemist was not as seductive anarrative as The Pilgrimage and that the story adopted by the author had already beenthe subject of a considerable number of books, plays, films and operas, something thatPaulo himself had commented on in his preface to the book.‘This is why The Alchemist, too, is a symbolic text. In the course of the book I passon everything I have learned. I’ve also tried to pay homage to great authors whomanaged to achieve a Universal Language: Hemingway, Blake, Borges (who also usedthe Persian story for one of his tales) and Malba Tahan, among others.’In the second half of 1988, Paulo was just wondering whether to move to a larger,more professional publisher than Eco, when he was set yet another trial by Jean. He andChris were to spend forty days in the Mojave Desert in southern California. A few daysbefore they were due to leave, he had an unsettling phone conversation with Mandarino,the owner of Eco, who, although he was still enthusiastic about The Pilgrimage, did notbelieve that The Alchemist would enjoy the same success. The best thing to do would beto postpone the trip and try to resolve the problem immediately, but Master J would notbe moved. And so in the middle of September, Paulo and Chris found themselvespractising the spiritual exercises of St Ignatius Loyola in the extreme heat of theMojave Desert, which could reach 50°C. Four years later, he wrote As Valkirias [The"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Valkyries], which was based on this experience.At the end of October, they returned to Rio. Paulo wanted to resolve his difficultieswith Eco immediately, but leaving the small publishing house without having anywhereelse to go was not a good idea. One night, wanting to forget these problems for a while,he went with a friend to a poetry recital that was being held in a small fashionable bar.During the entire evening, he had the strange feeling that someone in the audiencebehind him was staring at him. It was only when the evening came to an end and thelights went up that he turned and caught the fixed gaze of a pretty dark-haired younggirl in her early twenties. There was no apparent reason for anyone to look at him likethat. At forty-one, Paulo’s close-cropped hair was almost entirely white, as were hismoustache and goatee. The girl was too pretty for him not to approach her.He went up to her and asked straight out: ‘Were you by any chance looking at meduring the reading?’The girl smiled and said: ‘Yes, I was.’‘I’m Paulo Coelho.’‘I know. Look what I’ve got here in my bag.’She took out a battered copy of The Pilgrimage.Paulo was about to sign it, but when he heard that it belonged to a friend of hers, hegave it back, saying: ‘Buy your own copy and I’ll sign it.’They agreed to meet two days later in the elegant old Confeitaria Colombo, in thecentre of the city, so that he could sign her book. Although his choice of such aromantic venue might seem to indicate that he had other intentions, this was not thecase. He arrived more than half an hour late, saying that he couldn’t stay long becausehe had a meeting with his publisher, who had just confirmed that he was not interestedin continuing to publish The Alchemist. So that they could talk a little more, Paulo andthe girl walked together to the publisher’s office, which was ten blocks from theColombo.Her name was Mônica Rezende Antunes, and she was the twenty-year-old onlydaughter of liberal parents whose sole demand had been that she take a course inclassical ballet, which she abandoned almost at once. When she met Paulo, she wasstudying chemical engineering at the Universidade Estadual do Rio de Janeiro. WhatMônica remembers most vividly about that meeting was that she was ‘dressedridiculously’: ‘Imagine going to discuss contracts with your publisher in the companyof a girl in tiny shorts, a flowery blouse and hair like a nymphet!’Mônica ended up being a witness to the moment when Mandarino at Eco decidednot to continue to publish The Alchemist. He didn’t believe that a work of fiction suchas this could have the same degree of success as a personal narrative like ThePilgrimage. Although she had read only The Pilgrimage, Mônica couldn’t understandhow anyone could reject a book by an author who had made such an impact on her.Perhaps in an attempt to console himself, Paulo gave her a not very convincing"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"explanation for what might be Ernesto Mandarino’s real reason: with annual inflation inthe country running at 1,200 per cent it was more profitable to put his money infinancial deals than to publish books that ran the risk of not selling. The two of themwalked on together a little farther, exchanged telephone numbers and went theirdifferent ways.A few days later, before Paulo had decided what to do with the rights to TheAlchemist, he read in a newspaper column that Lya Luft would be signing her book ofpoetry, O Lado Fatal [The Fatal Side], at a cocktail party given by her publisher, PauloRoberto Rocco. Paulo had been keeping an eye on Editora Rocco for some time. It hadonly been in existence for just over ten years, but its catalogue already includedheavyweights like Gore Vidal, Tom Wolfe and Stephen Hawking. When Paulo arrived,the bookshop was crammed with people. Squeezing his way past waiters and guests, hewent up to Rocco, whom he knew only from photographs in newspapers, and said:‘Good evening, my name’s Paulo Coelho, we don’t know each other but...’‘I already know you by name.’‘I wanted to talk to you about my books. I’ve a friend, Bona, who lives in the samebuilding as you and had thought of asking her to give a dinner so she could introduceus.’‘You don’t need to ask anything of anyone. Come to my office and we’ll have acoffee and talk about your books.’Rocco arranged the meeting for two days later. Before making a decision, though,Paulo turned to the I Ching to find out whether or not he should hand The Alchemist to anew publisher, since Rocco had clearly shown an interest. From what he couldunderstand from the oracle’s response, it seemed that the book should be given to thenew publisher only if he agreed to have it in the bookshops before Christmas. This wasa highly convenient interpretation since, as any author knows, Christmas is the besttime of the year for selling books. As he was about to leave to meet Rocco, the phonerang. It was Mônica, whom he invited to go along with him.After a brief, friendly conversation with Rocco, Paulo left copies of The Pilgrimageand The Alchemist with him. The publisher thought it somewhat strange that Pauloshould want him to publish the book so quickly, but Paulo explained that all he had todo was buy the camera-ready copy from Eco, change the name of the publisher and putthe book on the market. Rocco said that he would think about it and would reply thatweek. In fact, two days later, he called to say that the new contract was ready forsignature. Rocco was going to publish The Alchemist."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25The critics’ responseREJECTED BY MANDARINO, The Alchemist became one of the most popular gifts not onlythat Christmas but on many other Christmases, New Years, Easters, Carnivals, Lentsand birthdays in Brazil and in more than a hundred other countries. The first edition tobe launched by his new publisher sold out within a few days, creating a most unusualsituation: an author with two books in the best-seller lists, one, The Alchemist, fictionand the other, The Pilgrimage, non-fiction. The Alchemist never stopped selling.The phenomenon that the book became in the hands of Rocco encouraged Paulo totake The Pilgrimage from Eco as well and give it to his new publisher. Needing apretext for such a change, he began to make demands on his old publisher. The first ofthese was an attempt to protect his royalties from the erosion caused by an astonishing1,350 per cent annual rate of inflation: instead of quarterly payments (a privilegeaccorded to very few authors), he wanted Mandarino to make them weekly, which heagreed to do even though it was against market practice. Taking advantage ofMandarino’s infinite patience (and his clear interest in retaining the book), Paulo thenadded two clauses hitherto unknown in Brazilian publishing contracts: daily monetarycorrection, linked to one of the mechanisms that existed at the time, and the use of apercentage of gross sales for marketing the book. These tactics seemed to be ofparticular interest to Mônica Antunes, who now went everywhere with Paulo. At thebeginning of 1989, she told him over dinner in a pizzeria in Leblon that she wasthinking of giving up her degree course at the university (she had just finished hersecond year in chemical engineering) and moving abroad with her boyfriend, Eduardo.The author’s eyes lit up, as if he had just seen a new door opening, and he said: ‘Greatidea! Why don’t you go to Spain? I’ve got various friends there who can help you. Youcould try to sell my books. If you succeed, you’ll get the 15 per cent commission everyliterary agent earns.’When she told her boyfriend about this, he discovered that the company for whichhe was working had a factory in Barcelona and it appeared, at first glance, that it wouldbe fairly easy to get a transfer there, or at least a paid placement for a few months.Mônica, meanwhile, had learned that some of the most important Spanish publishershad their headquarters in Barcelona.In the last week of May 1989, Mônica and Eduardo arrived in Madrid, where theystayed for three weeks before going on to Barcelona. During their first year in Spain,Mônica and Eduardo lived in an apartment in Rubí, just outside Barcelona. At book"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"fairs they would go to all the stands collecting publishers’ catalogues and would thenspend the following days sending each a small press release offering the Spanishlanguage rights to The Alchemist and other foreign language rights to publishers in othercountries for The Pilgrimage, which had been taken on and translated by the Bolivianagency H. Katia Schumer and published in Spanish by Martínez Roca.Meanwhile, in Brazil The Pilgrimage and The Alchemist remained at the top of thebest-seller lists. Although Mandarino had accepted all the author’s demands, at the endof 1989, he received a visit from Paulo Rocco, who brought bad news. For an advance ofUS$60,000, his company had acquired the publication rights to The Pilgrimage. Nearlytwo decades later, Ernesto Mandarino still cannot hide the hurt caused by the author onwhom he had gambled when he was still a nobody: ‘New editions were continuing tocome out–to the envy of other publishers. When he visited me, Rocco said that he wasoffering Paulo Coelho an advance of US$60,000. I said that if that was what he wanted,there was nothing I could do, as the contracts were renewable after each edition. Aftertwenty-eight editions of The Pilgrimage he left us. That really hurt. Almost as hurtfulwas the fact that, in interviews and articles, he never mentioned that he began with us.’Bad feelings apart, Mandarino recognizes the importance of the author not only inthe publishing world in Brazil but also in Brazilian literature: ‘Paulo Coelho madebooks into a popular consumer product. He revolutionized the publishing market inBrazil, which used to limit itself to ludicrously small runs of 3,000 copies. With him themarket grew. Paulo Coelho brought respect for books in Brazil and for our literature inthe world.’In a very small publishing market such as that in Brazil, it was only natural thatlarge publishers should feel interested in an author who, with only two titles to hisname, had sold more than five hundred thousand copies. Despite the Olympianindifference of the media, his books vanished from the bookshop shelves and thousandscrowded into auditoriums across the country, though not to listen to the usualpromotional rubbish. Readers seemed to want to share with the author the spiritualexperiences he wrote of in his works. Paulo’s talks were incredibly popular, and scenessuch as that in the Martins Pena auditorium in Brasília–when it was necessary to put uploudspeakers outside the 2,000-seater auditorium for those arriving late–were notuncommon. One interview which he gave to the journalist Mara Regea, of RádioNacional de Brasília, had to be repeated three times at the request of listeners wantingto hear him talk for an hour and a half on alchemy and mysticism. Such enthusiasm wasrepeated across the country. In Belo Horizonte, the 350-seat Banco do Desenvolvimentode Minas Gerais auditorium wasn’t large enough for the almost one thousand peoplewho turned up to hear him, forcing the young Afonso Borges, the organizer of the event,to place televisions in various parts of the building so that no one would miss theauthor’s words.When the press woke up to this phenomenon, it seemed confused and at a loss to"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"explain his overwhelming success. Reluctant to judge the literary content of the books,the newspapers preferred to regard them as yet another passing marketing phenomenon.In the opinion of a large number of journalists, the author Paulo Coelho was nothingmore than a fad, like the hula hoop, the twist and even the lyricist Paulo Coelho and hisSociedade Alternativa. Since O Globo had called him ‘the Castaneda of Copacabana’ onthe front page of its arts section two years earlier, the media had practically forgottenhim. It was only when his books reached the top of the best-seller lists and thenewspaper O Estado de São Paulo learned that The Pilgrimage and The Alchemist hadsold more than half a million copies that the critics took note of the fact that two yearswas a long time for something that was merely a fad. The man with the prematurelywhite hair who talked about dreams, angels and love seemed to be here to stay, but ittook a while for the press to understand this.He did not appear prominently in the newspapers again until October 1989, in afull-page feature in the arts supplement of O Estado de São Paulo, which was dividedinto two parts. The first was a profile written by Thereza Jorge on the author’s career inrock music. At the end, she stated unequivocally: ‘But it is in literature that Coelho hasclearly found his place.’ However, proof that opinions on his work were dividedappeared on that same page, in the form of a twenty-line item signed by Hamilton dosSantos. He summarized Paulo’s work as ‘a cloying synthesis of teachings drawn fromeverything from Christianity to Buddhism’. As the author himself confessed, this was‘the first real blow’ that he had received from a critic: ‘I just froze when I read it.Absolutely froze. It was as though the person who wrote it was warning me about theprice of fame.’Even the monthly literary tabloid Leia Livros, a cult publication edited by CaioGraco Prado, found itself bowing to the sheer force of numbers. On the cover of theDecember 1989 edition, Paulo appeared with sword in hand, hair bristling and gazingZen-like into infinity. The treatment meted out to him by Leia Livros, however, was nodifferent from the approach normally adopted by other members of the press. Of thetwelve pages of the article, eleven were taken up with a detailed profile of the author,with no evaluation of his work. The actual review, signed by Professor Teixeira Coelhoof the University of São Paulo, occupied only half a page. The average Brazilian–as onepresumes most readers of The Pilgrimage and The Alchemist were–might have haddifficulty in understanding whether Paulo was being praised or insulted, so convolutedwas the reviewer’s language:The time when vision, imagination, the non-rational (albeit with its ownrationality) were considered an integral part of the real and came ‘from above’it was just a mental habit. This norm defined a cultural paradigm, a way ofthinking and knowing about the world. This paradigm was replaced by the newrationalist paradigm of the eighteenth century. Today, it is this paradigm that"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"appears to be (temporarily) exhausted. The Paulo Coelho phenomenon is asymbol of the decadence of this paradigm and implies a distrust of rationalismas we have known it over the last two centuries.[...] I prefer to see in the sales success of Paulo Coelho’s works theprimacy of the imagination, which continues to exert its power in differentforms (religions, ‘magic’, ‘alternative’ medicine and sex, the poetic road toknowledge), forms that old-fashioned emblematic Cartesian thinking woulddesignate as ‘irrational’.[...] Within the Paulo Coelho genre, Lawrence Durrell with his ‘AvignonQuintet’ is a better writer, and Colin Wilson more intellectual. However, suchjudgements are superfluous.While the press was racking its brains as to how to understand the phenomenon, itcontinued to grow. In a rare unguarded moment–especially when it came to money–Paulo revealed to the Jornal da Tarde that the two books had so far earned himUS$250,000. It may well have been more. Assuming that the amounts he and Roccodisclosed were true, the 500,000 copies sold up until then would have brought him atleast $350,000 in royalties.With two best-sellers, a new publisher, hundreds of thousands of dollars or moreinvested in property and his international career showing signs of taking off, Paulo wassummoned by Jean to fulfil another of the four sacred paths that initiates to RAM mustfollow. After the Road to Santiago, he had performed a further penance (the trip to theMojave Desert), but there was still the third and penultimate stage, the Road to Rome.The fourth would be the road towards death. The so-called Road to Rome was merely ametaphor, since it could be followed anywhere in the world, with the added advantagethat it could be undertaken by car. He chose Languedoc, on the edge of the Pyrenees insouthwestern France, where a Christian religious sect, Catharism or Albigensianism,had flourished in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, only to be stamped out by theInquisition. Another peculiarity of the Road to Rome was that the pilgrim must alwaysfollow his dreams. Paulo thought this too abstract and asked for more information, butthe reply was less than illuminating: ‘If you dream of a bus stop during the night, thefollowing morning go to the nearest bus stop. If you dream of a bridge, your next stopshould be a bridge.’For a little more than two months he wandered through the valleys and across themountains and rivers of what is one of the most beautiful regions of Europe. On 15August he left the Hotel d’Anvers in Lourdes, where he had been staying, and continuedon towards Foix, Roquefixade, Montségur, Peyrepertuse, Bugarach and dozens of othertiny villages which were, in the majority of cases, no more than a handful of houses.Since Jean had made no restrictions on the matter, Paulo travelled part of the route inthe company of Mônica, who skipped work in Barcelona for a week in order to go with"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"him.On the evening of 21 August 1989, when they reached Perpignan, he used a publicphone to call Chris in Brazil, because he was missing her. Chris told him that his ex-partner Raul Seixas had died in São Paulo from pancreatitis, brought on by alcoholism.This was an enormous loss for Paulo. After not seeing one another for several years,he and Raul had met up again four months earlier in Rio de Janeiro during a show Raulwas giving in Canecão, which would prove to be one of his last. It was not areconciliation, since they had never quarrelled, but it was an attempt on the part ofRaul’s new musical partner, the young rock star Marcelo Nova, to bring them backtogether again. During the show, Paulo was called up on to the stage to sing the chorus‘Viva! Viva! Viva a Sociedade Alternativa!’ with the band. According to his ex-slaveToninho Buda, the author sang with his hands in his pockets, ‘because he was beingforced to sing Crowley’s mantra in public and had to keep his fingers crossed’. Parts ofthe show were filmed by an amateur fan and put on the Internet years later. They show ashaky Raul Seixas, his face puffy and with all the appearance of someone ruined bydrink.The last work the two had done together was the LP Mata Virgem, which had beenrecorded long ago, in 1978. In 1982 the Eldorado label, based in São Paulo, tried torevive the duo with a new album, but as a Rio journalist put it, they both seemed to be‘inflicted by acute primadonnaitis’: Paulo lived in Rio and Raul in São Paulo, and bothrefused to travel to where the other was in order to start work. Solomon-like, RobertoMenescal suggested a solution. He had been invited to produce the record and suggestedmeeting exactly halfway between the two cities in the Itatiaia national park. Theyarrived at the Hotel Simon on a Sunday, and when Paulo woke early on the Monday,before even having a coffee, he left a note under the door of Raul’s room: ‘I’m ready tostart work.’ Raul didn’t even show his face. The same thing happened again on Tuesday.On the Wednesday, the owner went to Paulo, concerned that Raul had been shut up inhis room for three days, drinking and not even touching the sandwiches he had orderedby phone. Any hope of reuniting the duo who had revolutionized Brazilian rock musicdied there and then.Six days after the news of the death of his ‘close enemy’, still shaken and still onthe Road to Rome, Paulo had what he describes as another extrasensory experience. Hewas heading for one of the small towns in the region where he was to take part in the so-called ritual of fire, during which invocations are made in the light of a bonfire. On theway, he says, he felt the presence beside him of no less a person–or thing–than hisguardian angel. It wasn’t a tangible or audible being, nor even an ectoplasm, but a beingwhose presence he could clearly feel and with whom he could only communicatementally. According to his recollection, it was the being that took the initiative, and anon-verbal dialogue took place.‘What do you want?’"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Paulo kept his eyes on the road and said: ‘I want my books to be read.’‘But in order for that to happen you’re going to have to take a lot of flack.’‘But why? Just because I want my books to be read?’‘Your books will bring you fame, and then you’re really going to get it in the neck.You’ve got to decide whether that really is what you want.’Before disappearing into the atmosphere, the being said to him: ‘I’m giving you aday to think about it. Tonight you will dream of a particular place. That’s where weshall meet at the same time tomorrow.’In the hotel where he was staying in Pau, he dreamed of a small ‘tram’ takingpassengers to the top of a very high mountain. When he woke the following morning, helearned at reception that one of the city’s attractions was precisely that: a cable car, theFuniculaire de Pau, which set off only a few metres from the hotel, next to the railwaystation. The hill where the dark-green cable car let off its thirty or so passengers everyten minutes was not as high as the one in his dream, but there was no doubt that he wason the right route. When it was getting dark, more or less twenty-four hours after theapparition of the previous day, Paulo joined a short queue and minutes later, reached aterrace surrounded by fountains–the Fontaine de Vigny, where he had an amazing viewof the lights in the city coming on. The writer recalls clearly not only the date–‘It was27 September 1989, the feast-day of Cosmos and Damian’–but also what he said to theapparition: ‘I want my books to be read. But I want to be able to renew my wish in threeyears’ time. Give me three years and I’ll come back here on 27 September 1992 and tellyou whether I’m man enough to continue or not.’The seemingly interminable seventy days of the pilgrimage were drawing to aclose, when one night, following the ‘ritual of fire’, a fair-skinned, fair-haired youngwoman went up to him and began a conversation. Her name was Brida O’Fern, and shewas a thirty-year-old Irish woman who had reached the rank of Master in RAM and, likehim, was following the Road to Rome. Brida’s company proved to be not only apleasant gift that would alleviate his weariness as he completed the pilgrimage, forPaulo was so delighted by the stories she told him that he decided to base his third bookon her, which, like her, would be called Brida. Writing about the Road to Rome couldcome later.Once he had completed the trial set by Jean, he set about writing Brida, using amethod he would continue to use from then on: he would ponder the subject for sometime and then, when the story was ready, write the book in two weeks. The novel tellsthe story and adventures of the young Brida O’Fern, who, at twenty-one, decides toenter the world of magic. Her discoveries start when she meets a wizard in a forest 150kilometres from Dublin. Guided by the witch Wicca, she starts her journey and, aftercompleting all the rituals, finally becomes a Master in RAM. In the very first pages theauthor warns his readers:"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"In my book The Diary of a Magus, I replaced two of the practices of RAM withexercises in perception learned in the days when I worked in drama. Althoughthe results were, strictly speaking, the same, I received a severe reprimandfrom my Teacher. ‘There may well be quicker or easier methods, that doesn’tmatter; what matters is that the Tradition remains unchanged,’ he said. For thisreason, the few rituals described in Brida are the same as those practised overthe centuries by the Tradition of the Moon–a specific tradition, which requiresexperience and practice. Practising such rituals without guidance is dangerous,inadvisable, unnecessary and can greatly hinder the Spiritual Search.Encouraged by the success of The Pilgrimage and The Alchemist, Rocco, when helearned that Paulo had a new book on the boil, took the initiative and offered himUS$60,000 for Brida. Although the amount offered was high by Brazilian standards, itcertainly didn’t break any records (a few months earlier Rocco had paid US$180,000 forthe right to publish Tom Wolfe’s novel The Bonfire of the Vanities). What was sodifferent was the way in which Paulo proposed that the money should be divided up, amethod he would continue to use in almost all negotiations over his future publicationsin Brazil: US$20,000 would be spent by the publisher on promotion and advertising; afurther US$20,000 would be used to cover the journeys he would have to make withinBrazil to promote the book; and only US$20,000 would go to him as an advance againstroyalties. The biggest surprise, which was kept secret by the publisher until a few daysbefore its launch during the first week of August 1990, was that the first edition ofBrida would have a print run of 100,000 copies–a run surpassed among Brazilianauthors only by Jorge Amado, whose novel Tieta do Agreste [translated as Tieta, theGoat Girl] was launched in 1977 with an initial print run of 120,000 copies.The angel Paulo met near Pau was absolutely right when he predicted that theauthor would be massacred by the critics. The Pilgrimage and The Alchemist had beentreated fairly gently by the press, but when Brida was launched, the critics appeared towant blood. Merciless and on many occasions almost rude, the main newspapers in Rioand São Paulo seemed determined to demolish him:The author writes very badly. He doesn’t know how to use contractions, his useof pronouns is poor, he chooses prepositions at random, and doesn’t know evensimple things, like the difference between the verbs ‘to speak’ and ‘to say’.(Luiz Garcia, O Globo)In aesthetic terms, Brida is a failure. It is an imitation of Richard Bach’stedious model seasoned with a little Carlos Castaneda. Paulo Coelho’s book isfull of stereotypes."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"(Juremir Machado da Silva, O Estado de São Paulo)What he should perhaps announce more boldly is that he can make it rain. Forthat is precisely what Paulo Coelho does–on his own garden.(Eugênio Bucci, Folha de São Paulo)...one of those books which, once you’ve put it down, you can’t pick up again.(Raul Giudicelli, Jornal do Commercio)The insults came from all sides, not only from newspapers and magazines. A few daysafter the launch of Brida, the author was interviewed on a popular Brazilian televisionchat show, Jô Soares Onze e Meia, which was broadcast nationally by SBT. Althoughthey were friends and had worked together on the soft-porn movie Tangarela, a Tangade Cristal, the presenter joined the attack on Paulo Coelho and opened the programmewith a list of dozens of errors he had discovered in The Alchemist. The interviewprovoked a parallel squabble. Two days later, the Rio newspaper O Dia carried a note inthe column written by Artur da Távola, Paulo’s ex-colleague in the working group atPhilips and someone who had contributed a preface to Arquivos do Inferno, entitled‘Credit where credit’s due, Jô’:Although we weren’t given due credit–he did, after all, go into the studio with afax of the article published in this paper listing the eighty-six [grammatical]mistakes found in The Alchemist, requested from us by the producers of theirprogramme on SBT–Jô Soares interviewed the writer Paulo Coelho the daybefore yesterday going on about the errors overlooked by Editora Rocco.The magus justified the publisher’s editorial laxity by stating that all theerrors had been made on purpose. ‘They’re codes,’ said Paulo Coelho. ‘If theyweren’t, they would have been corrected in later editions.’There remained, however, a faint hope that someone in the media might read his bookswith the same unprejudiced eyes as the thousands of people who were flocking tobookshops across the country looking for one of his three books. Perhaps it would beBrazil’s most widely read and influential weekly, Veja, which had decided to put him onits next cover? After giving a long interview and posing for photographs, the writerwaited anxiously for Sunday morning, when the magazine would arrive on the news-stands in Rio. The first surprise was seeing the cover, where, instead of his photo, hefound the image of a crystal ball under the title ‘The Tide of Mysticism’. He quicklyleafed through the magazine until he came to the article, entitled ‘The All-High Wizard’"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"and illustrated with a photograph of him in a black cloak and trainers and holding acrook in his hand. He began to skim-read, but needed to go no farther than the tenth lineto realize that the journalist (the article was unsigned) was using heavy artillery fire:Brida, The Pilgrimage and The Alchemist were all classed as ‘books with badly toldmetaphysical stories steeped in a vague air of mysticism’. In the following six pages,the bombardment continued with the same intensity, and hardly a paragraph went bythat did not contain some criticism, gibe or ironic remark: ‘crazy superstitions’ ‘it’simpossible to know where genuine belief ends and farce begins’ ‘yet another surfer onthe lucrative wave of mysticism’ ‘he pocketed US$20,000 as an advance forperpetrating Brida and is already thinking of charging for his talks’ ‘surely the worst ofhis books’ ‘pedestrian fiction’. Not even his faith was spared. Referring to the religiousorder to which he belonged, Veja stated that Regnum Agnus Mundi was nothing morethan ‘an assemblage of Latin words that could be translated approximately as Kingdomof the Lamb of the World’. Despite the hours of interviewing time he had given them,only one sentence was used in its entirety. When he was asked what was the reason forhis success, he had replied: ‘It’s a divine gift.’The author reacted by writing a short letter to Veja, saying: ‘I should like to makejust one correction to the article “The All-High Wizard”. I do not intend to charge formy talks to the public. The remainder came as no surprise: we are all idiots and you arevery intelligent.’ He sent a long article to the journalist Luiz Garcia of O Globo, whichwas published under the headline ‘I am the Flying Saucer of Literature’, and in whichfor the first time Paulo complained about the treatment he had received from the media:At the moment I am the flying saucer of literature–regardless of whether or notyou like its shape, its colours and its crew. So I can understand theastonishment, but why the aggression? For three years the public has beenbuying my books in ever greater numbers and I really don’t think I could foolso many people in so many age groups and from all social classes at the sametime. All I’ve done is try to show my truth and the things in which I sincerelybelieve–although the critics haven’t even spared my beliefs.The author of the review replied on the same page, at the end of which he adopted asabrasive a tone as he had before: ‘Resigned to the fact that he will continue, as he saysin his all too mistakable style, to “fight the good fight”, I would simply advise him notto persist with his thesis that writing simply and writing badly are the same thing. Itdoes him no favours.’Fortunately for Paulo, the bacteria of the critics’ remarks did not infect sales.

A week after it"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"went on the market, Brida topped the best-seller lists throughout the country, bringingthe author a new record, that of having three books simultaneously in the national best-seller lists. The popular phenomenon that Paulo Coelho had become meant that publicfigures, intellectuals and artists had to have an opinion about him. Curiously enough, tojudge by the statements in various newspapers and magazines of the time, while thecritics may have been unanimous, the world of celebrities seemed divided:He’s a genius.

Encouraged by his success, Paulo waspreparing to write a non-fiction book, a real bombshell that he intended to be in theshops in 1991. It was an autobiographical book that would describe his adventures withRaul Seixas in the world of black magic and satanism–including, of course, the ‘blacknight’, when he believed that he had come face-to-face with the Devil. He usually gaveChris the text to read only when he had finished the book, but this time he handed it toher a chapter at a time. While Paulo spent his days bent over his computer, she waselectrified by what she was reading. When he was already on page 600, though, she gavehim a piece of harsh advice.‘Paulo, stop writing that book.’‘What!’‘I love the book. The problem is that it’s all about Evil. I know Evil is fascinating,but you can’t go on writing it.’He tried to talk her out of this crazy idea ‘first, with arguments and then by kickinganything that happened to be near’: ‘You’re mad, Chris! You might have told me thaton page 10, not page 600!’‘OK, I’ll tell you the reason for my concerns: I looked at Our Lady of Aparecida,and she said that you can’t write this book.’ (She was referring to the black patron saintof Brazil.)After much discussion, Chris’s point of view won the day, as usually happened.When he decided that the wretched work would die, unpublished, Paulo printed out oneversion of the book and then deleted all traces of it from his computer.He arranged to have lunch with his publisher, Paulo Rocco, in the elegantPortuguese restaurant Antiquarius, in Leblon, and put the great thick tome on the table,saying: ‘Here’s the new book. Open it at any page.’Rocco, out of superstition, normally never read any of Paulo’s original texts beforesending them off to the printer; this time, though, he thought that he should do as theauthor suggested. He opened the typescript at random and read the page, and when hefinished, Paulo said: ‘Besides myself and Christina, you will have been the only personto read any part of this book, because I’m going to destroy it. The only reason I’m notasking the waiter to flambé it right here and now is because I don’t want the negativeenergy to turn to fire. I’ve already deleted it from my computer.’After lunch, Paulo went alone to Leblon beach, looking for somewhere to bury thebook for good. When he saw a rubbish truck chewing up the contents of the litter binsoutside the buildings along the seafront, he went up to it, threw the package containingthe original into the rotating drum and, in a matter of seconds, the book that wouldnever be read had been utterly destroyed."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26Success abroadDESTROYING A BOOK laden with so much negative energy may have saved Paulo fromfuture metaphysical problems, but it presented him and his publisher with a newproblem: what to launch in 1991 in order to capitalize on the phenomenal success of thethree previous best-sellers. Paulo suggested to Rocco that he adapt and translate intoPortuguese a small book, little more than a pamphlet, containing a sermon given inEngland in 1890 by the young Protestant missionary Henry Drummond: The GreatestThing in the World, based on St Paul’s letter to the Corinthians in which the author talksof the virtues of patience, goodness, humility, generosity, kindness, surrender,tolerance, innocence and sincerity as manifestations ‘of the supreme gift given toHumanity: love’. It was given the new title of The Supreme Gift [O Dom Supremo] anddespite being published with little fuss and almost entirely ignored by the media, in amatter of weeks, The Supreme Gift had entered the best-seller lists, where his otherthree books, The Pilgrimage, The Alchemist and Brida, had become permanent fixtures.Its success did not, however, appear to satisfy the author. In the long run, this wasnot a work of his own but a translation produced in order to fill a gap. Paulo decided ona story that had been in his mind since 1988: his adventure with Chris in the MojaveDesert. The task that had been entrusted to him by Jean, Paulo says, was precise: he andChris were to spend forty days in the Mojave Desert, one of the largest of the Americannational parks. The desert is known for its hostile climate and its unique geologicalformations, notably the Valley of Death; it is a place where the rivers and lakesdisappear for half the year, leaving behind only dried-up beds. In order to fulfil the trialset by the Master–to find his guardian angel–the writer would have to employ a guide inthe immense desert that stretches across California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona. Theperson chosen by Jean was Took.On 5 September 1988, the couple landed at Los Angeles airport, where they hired acar and drove south towards the Salton Sea, a saltwater lake 50 kilometres long and 20wide. After hours of driving, they reached one of those half-abandoned gas stations thatare so common in films about the American West. ‘Is it far to the desert?’ Paulo askedthe girl who was working the pump. She said no, they were about 30 kilometres fromthe small town of Borrego Springs, on the edge of the desert, and gave them someimportant advice: not to turn on the air-conditioning when the car was stationary, toavoid overheating the engine; to put four gallons of water in the boot; and not to leavethe vehicle should anything unforeseen happen. Paulo was astounded to learn that the"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"desert was so close: ‘The climate there was comfortable and the vegetation was aluxuriant green. I found it hard to believe that a fifteen-minute drive away everythingwould change so radically, but that is precisely what happened: as soon as we crossed achain of mountains the road began to descend and there in front of us lay the silence andthe immensity of the Mojave.’During the forty days they spent camping or, when they could, staying in hotels,Paulo and Chris lived with the historical remnants that form part of the legend of thedesert: abandoned gold mines, the dusty carcasses of pioneers’ wagons, ghost towns,hermits, communities of hippies who spent the day in silent meditation. Besides these,the only living beings they came across were the so-called Mojave locals: rattle snakes,hares and coyotes–animals that come out only at night in order to avoid the heat.The first two weeks of the forty days were to be spent in total silence, with thecouple not being allowed to exchange so much as a ‘good morning’. This period was tobe entirely devoted to the spiritual exercises of St Ignatius Loyola. These exercises,which were approved by the Vatican in 1548, are the fruit of the personal experience ofthe founder of the Society of Jesus. It is a spirituality that is not to be preached about orintellectualized but experienced. ‘It is through experience that the mystery of God willbe revealed to each person, in a singular, individual form,’ the manuals produced by theJesuits explain, ‘and it is this revelation that will transform your life.’ St Ignatius’ aimwas that each individual practising these exercises should become a contemplativeduring this time, ‘which means seeing in each and every thing the figure of God, thepresence of the Holy Trinity constructing and reconstructing the world’. And that waswhat Paulo and Chris did during the first two weeks, offering up prayers and reflectionsin their search for God.One night, a week after their arrival, they were sitting immersed in this atmosphereof spirituality, beneath a sky filled with millions of stars, when a great crash shatteredthe peace and silence, immediately followed by a second, and then another and another.The deafening noise was coming from the sky and was caused by gigantic balls of fireexploding and breaking up into thousands of coloured fragments, briefly illuminatingthe entire desert. It took a few seconds for them to be convinced that this was notArmageddon: ‘Startled, we saw brilliant lights falling slowly from the sky, lighting upthe desert as if it were day. Suddenly, we began to hear crashes around us: it was thesound of military planes breaking the sound barrier. Illuminated by thatphantasmagorical light, they were dropping incendiary bombs somewhere on thehorizon. It was only the next day that we learned that the desert is used for militaryexercises. It was terrifying.’At the end of those first two weeks of spiritual practices, and still following theinstructions given by Jean, they finally reached Took’s old trailer, permanently parkednear Borrego Springs. Both Paulo and Chris were surprised to see that the powerfulparanormal to whom Jean had referred was a young man of twenty. Guided by the"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"young magus, Paulo was to travel through dozens of small towns on the frontierbetween the United States and Mexico until he met a group known in the region as the‘Valkyries’. These were eight very attractive women who wandered through the townsof the Mojave dressed in black leather and driving powerful motorbikes. They were ledby the eldest of the eight, Valhalla, a former executive of Chase Manhattan Bank, who,like Paulo and Took, was also an initiate in RAM. It was through contact with her that,on the thirty-eighth day of their journey, Paulo–without Chris this time–came across ablue butterfly and a voice which, he says, spoke to him. After this, the author states, hesaw his angel–or at least the materialization of part of his angel: an arm that shone inthe sunlight and dictated biblical words which he wrote down, shaking and terrified, ona piece of paper. Trembling with emotion, he could not wait to tell Chris what he hadexperienced and to explain that ‘seeing the angel was even easier than talking to it’. ‘Allyou had to do was to believe in angels, to need angels, and there they were, shining inthe morning light.’To celebrate the event, Paulo drove into the desert with Chris and Took to a villageknown as Glorieta Canyon. After walking across an area of barren, stony ground, theauthor stopped in front of a small grotto. Then he took bags of cement and sand and aflagon of water from the boot of the car and began to prepare some mortar. When it wasthe right consistency, he covered the floor of the grotto with the cement and, before themixture began to harden, he affixed a small image of Our Lady of Aparecida, which hehad brought with him. At the foot of the image he wrote in the still-wet cement thefollowing words in English: ‘THIS IS THE VIRGIN OF APARECIDA FROM BRAZIL.ASK FOR A MIRACLE AND RETURN HERE.’ He lit a candle, said a quick prayer andleft.On his return to Brazil, Paulo was to spend three more years pondering those eventsin the Mojave Desert. It was only at the end of 1991, when he felt that the typescript hehad destroyed required a replacement, that he decided to write The Valkyries. Accordingto the records of his computer’s word-processing program, he typed the first words ofthe book at 23.30 on 6 January 1992. After seventeen uninterrupted days of work, as hadbecome his custom, he typed the final sentence of the 239th and final page of the work:‘And only then will we be able to understand stars, angels and miracles.’On 21 April, when the book had gone through all the editorial processes and wasready to be printed, Paulo sent a fax from his apartment in Rio to Editora Rocco sayingthat Jean was not suggesting but ‘ordering’ and ‘demanding’ changes to the text:Dear Rocco:Half an hour ago, I received a phone call from J. (the Master), ordering meto delete (or change) two pages in the book. These pages are in the middle ofthe book and refer to a scene called ‘The ritual that demolishes rituals’. He saysthat in the scene I must not describe things exactly as they happened, that I"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"should use allegorical language or break off the narrative of the ritual before Ireach the forbidden part.I have decided to opt for the second alternative, but this is going to meanme doing some rewriting. I will make these changes over the holiday, but I wasanxious to let you know this. You can send someone to collect the following onThursday:–the changes demanded by my Master;–the new ‘Author’s Note’If I can’t manage this, I’ll send you another fax, but my Master said that Iwas to contact the publisher immediately and that’s precisely what I’m doing(even though I know that today is a holiday).Paulo CoelhoBesides Jean, the author and Paulo Rocco, no one would ever know what the censoredpassages contained. The removal of those passages doesn’t in any way appear to havecompromised the success of The Valkyries. Less than twenty-four hours after the book’slaunch in August 1992, 60,000 copies of the initial 120,000 print run had vanished fromthe bookshop shelves. A fortnight later, The Alchemist lost its number one spot in thebest-seller lists, where it had remained for 159 consecutive weeks, to give way to TheValkyries. The author was breaking one record after another. With The Valkyries, hebecame the first Brazilian to have no fewer than five books in the best-seller lists.Besides the new launch, there were The Alchemist (159 weeks), Brida (106 weeks), ThePilgrimage (68 weeks) and The Supreme Gift (19 weeks)–something which had onlybeen bettered at the time by Sidney Sheldon. What most caught the attention of thepress, apart from the astonishing sales figures, were the details of the author’s contractwith Rocco. One newspaper stated that Paulo was to receive 15 per cent of the coverprice of the book (as opposed to the usual 10 per cent), while another revealed that hewould have a bonus of US$400,000 when sales passed the 600,000 mark. A thirdspeculated about the money spent by the publisher on publicity and said that, in order toprotect himself against inflation, the author had demanded payments every fortnight.The Jornal do Brasil stated that in the wake of the success of The Valkyries the marketwould be ‘inundated with plastic knickknacks with the inscription “I believe in angels”,posters announcing that “the angels are among us” and china replicas of the author,complete with goatee, as well as 600 shirts with a company logo and the ArchangelMichael’. One Rio columnist said that the author had supposedly turned down apayment of US$45,000 to appear in an advertisement for an insurance company inwhich he would say: ‘I believe in life after death, but, just in case, get some insurance.’A further novelty was that, from then on, Paulo was also able to influence the coverprice of the book–an area in which, generally speaking, authors do not become involved.Concerned to keep his work accessible to those with less buying power, he went on to"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"set a ceiling price for his books which, in the case of The Valkyries, was US$11.Once the initial interest in numbers, records and figures had passed, the criticismsstarted to pile in, couched in much the same terms as the reviews of his earlier books:The literary mediocrity of The Valkyries does at least have one positive effect.It could have been thrilling, but is, in fact, dull, and is, therefore, easier to read.(Folha de São Paulo)In terms of literature, if one understands by that the art of writing, TheValkyries is generously endowed with the same qualities as Coelho’s previousbooks, namely, none at all.(Veja)Paulo Coelho’s books, and The Valkyries is no exception, do not stand out fortheir stylistic excellence. Plot-line apart, the books consist of crudelyconstructed sentences that appear to have been taken from a schoolcomposition.(O Estado de São Paulo)In the midst of this bombardment, however, the newspapers had quietly let it be knownthat the Ministry of Education in Rio wanted to use Paulo Coelho’s works as a means ofgetting students to read. The two reactions to the idea, both published in the Jornal doBrasil, were even harsher than the words of the critics. In the first of these, entitled‘Stupidities’, the journalist Roberto Marinho de Azevedo said that he was astoundedand accused the ministry of ‘feeding these innocents with eighth-hand mysticismwritten in sloppy Portuguese’. Even worse was the illustration accompanying thearticle, a caricature of a student with the ears of a donkey holding a copy of ThePilgrimage. Having published four books and become one of the greatest literarysuccesses of all time in Brazil, Paulo could count on the fingers of one hand the positivereviews he had received. Unable to offer readers an explanation as to why an authorwhom they considered mediocre was so successful, the media flailed around foranswers. Some preferred to put it all down to publicity, but this left one questionunanswered: if it was so simple, why didn’t other authors and publishers adopt the sameformula? When she was travelling in Brazil before the launch of The Valkyries, MônicaAntunes was sought out by the Jornal do Brasil and asked the same old question: towhat do you attribute Paulo Coelho’s success? She replied with the prophetic words:‘What we are witnessing is only the start of a fever.’Another argument used to explain his success–the low cultural level of Brazilians,"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"who are little used to reading–was soon to be demolished by the arrival of Paulo’sbooks in the two most important publishing markets, America and France. This began inthe United States at the end of 1990. Paulo was staying in Campinas, 100 kilometresfrom São Paulo, preparing for a debate on his book Brida with students at theUniversidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp), when the telephone rang. On the otherend of the line was Alan Clarke, a man in his fifties, owner of the Gentleman’s Farmer,a five-room bed-and-breakfast hotel in the small town of West Barnstable, inMassachusetts. Speaking fluent Portuguese, Clarke explained that during his free time,he worked as a certified translator and had worked for some years in Brazil as anexecutive with ITT, which dominated the telecommunications industry in a large part ofthe world until the end of the 1980s. He had read and enjoyed The Pilgrimage and wasoffering to translate it into English.Paulo knew that the American market could be a springboard to the rest of theworld, but he was not excited by the idea and said: ‘Thank you for your interest, butwhat I need is a publisher in the United States, not a translator.’Clarke was not put off: ‘All right, then, can I try and find a publisher for the book?’Sure that the conversation would lead nowhere, Paulo agreed. Never having workedbefore on a literary project, Alan Clarke translated the 240 pages of The Pilgrimage andset off with his English translation under his arm. After hearing the word ‘No’ twenty-two times, he came across someone who was interested. All his efforts had been worthit, because the publisher was none other than HarperCollins, at the time the largest inthe United States. It was not until 1992, when Paulo was launching The Valkyries inBrazil, that The Pilgrimage, under the title The Diary of a Magician, was published (thetitle was changed much later). Days and weeks went by and it became clear that thebook was never going to be a blockbuster. ‘The book simply didn’t happen,’ the authorrecalls. ‘It got no media coverage and was practically ignored by the critics.’However, this lack of success did not dishearten his agent-cum-translator. Somemonths after its launch, Clarke took his translation of The Alchemist to HarperCollins,and the book won the hearts of all the professional readers invited to give their opinionas to whether or not to launch it on the American market. HarperCollins’ enthusiasm forthe book can be judged by the size of the initial print run: 50,000 hardback copies.HarperCollins’ instincts were shown to be right: in a few weeks, the book was in thebest-seller lists of important newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times, the SanFrancisco Chronicle and the Chicago Tribune. The hardback version was so successfulthat the publisher didn’t put the paperback version on the market until two years later.The explosion of The Alchemist opened doors to markets of which the author hadnever even dreamed. Published in Australia immediately after its publication in theUnited States, The Alchemist was acclaimed by the Sydney Morning Herald as ‘the bookof the year’. The newspaper stated that it was ‘an enchanting work of infinitephilosophical beauty’. Australian readers seemed to agree, since weeks after arriving in"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"the bookshops it was number one on the Herald’s own best-seller list. However, Paulowas dreaming of greater things. He knew that recognition as an author would come notfrom New York or Sydney but from the other side of the Atlantic. His dream was to bepublished, and above all read, in France, the land of Victor Hugo, Flaubert and Balzac.At the beginning of 1993, during a short trip to Spain, Paulo was asked by the agentCarmen Balcells if she could represent him. The owner of the most respected literaryagency in Europe, Balcells counted among her authors Mario Vargas Llosa and GabrielGarcía Márquez. Her request was a huge temptation, especially since, unlike mostliterary agents, among them Mônica Antunes, who received 15 per cent, the agency tookonly 10 per cent of its authors’ royalties.Paulo had been concerned for some time about his and Mônica’s complete lack ofexperience in the foreign publishing world. Neither of them had the necessary contacts.He was worried that Mônica would waste her youth on trying to sell his work abroad, aventure that had so far lasted four years and brought no real results. ‘It was my duty totell her that she could never make a living working solely as my international agent,’the author recalled some time later. ‘For her to be able to live well I would have to sellmillions of books abroad, and that wasn’t happening.’ They needed to have a talk. Aftergiving the matter serious thought, he invited her for a coffee in a small bar in Barcelonaand came straight to the point. More than a dialogue, their conversation was a kind oftense verbal arm-wrestle.‘You know who Carmen Balcells is, don’t you?’‘Yes.’‘Well, she sent me this letter proposing that her agency represent me. You’reinvesting in someone you believe in, but let’s be realistic: we’re not getting anywhere.This business needs experience; it’s a serious gamble.’Mônica did not appear to understand what she was hearing, but Paulo went on:‘Let’s accept that our work hasn’t, as we hoped, borne fruit. There’s nothing wrong withthat. It’s my life that’s at stake, but I don’t want you also to sacrifice yours in search ofa dream that seems impossible.’She could hardly believe what she was hearing.‘So, realistically speaking, what do you think about us terminating our professionalrelationship? If I want to go to Carmen Balcells now, I will. I’ll pay you for all the yearsof work you’ve put in and I’ll get on with my life. But the final decision is up to you.You’ve invested four years of your life in me, and I’m not going to be the one who getsrid of you. It’s just that you have to understand that it would be best for both of us tocall a halt. Do you agree?’‘No.’‘What do you mean “No”? I’m going to pay you for the time you’ve given me, forall your efforts. It’s not as if I had a contract with you, Mônica.’‘No way. If you want to get rid of me, you can, but I’m not going to ask to leave.’"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"‘You know who Carmen Balcells is, don’t you? You’re asking me to say “No” toher? She’s going to announce that she is taking me on by filling the Frankfurt Book Fairwith posters of my books, and you want me to say “No”?’‘No. I’m saying that you can sack me, if you want. You’re free to do as you wish.After all, you made a separate deal with Alan Clarke in the States, didn’t you? I thinkthat I could do much better than him.’Her utter conviction meant that Paulo could go no further. In a second, his dream ofposters in Frankfurt and being in the same catalogue as García Márquez and VargasLlosa had evaporated. He had swapped the elegant offices in central Barcelona occupiedby Carmen Balcells and her dozens of employees for Sant Jordi Asociados, which wasnothing more than a bookshelf with some cardboard files in the small apartment whereMônica lived.In September, she plucked up her courage and prepared to face her first bigchallenge: to try to sell Paulo Coelho at the most important annual meeting ofpublishers and literary agents, the Frankfurt Book Fair.At twenty-five, with no experience in the field and afraid of facing this challengealone, she decided she needed the company of a friend, her namesake Mônica Moreira.The first surprise when she arrived in Frankfurt was the discovery that there wasn’t asingle hotel room to be found in the city. It hadn’t occurred to them to makereservations in advance and so they ended up having to sleep in a youth hostel in aneighbouring town. For the four days that the fair lasted, Mônica worked like a Trojan.Unlike the posters and banners used by Balcells, her only weapon was a modestpublicity kit–a brief biography and a summary of the success Paulo’s books had enjoyedin Brazil and in other countries. She visited the stands of publishers from all over theworld one by one, arranging as many meetings as possible. Her efforts were royallyrewarded: by the end of the year, Mônica had sold the rights of Paulo Coelho’s books inno fewer than sixteen languages.The first contract she negotiated in Frankfurt, with the Norwegian publisherExLibris, also had the virtue of changing her personal life: four years later, in 1997, theowner of ExLibris, Øyvind Hagen, and Mônica decided to marry. In a matter of months,she drew up contracts for the publication of The Pilgrimage, The Alchemist, or both, notonly in Norway but also in Australia, Japan, Portugal, Mexico, Romania, Argentina,South Korea and Holland.In the same year, 1993, Paulo entered the Brazilian version of The Guinness Book ofRecords after The Alchemist had been in Veja’s best-seller list for an impressive 208consecutive weeks. However, there was still no sign from France. Mônica had sent theAmerican version of The Alchemist to several French publishers, but none showed anyinterest in this unknown Brazilian. One of those who turned down Paulo Coelho’s bookswas Robert Laffont, the owner of a traditional, reputable publishing house foundedduring the Second World War. The indifference with which The Alchemist was received"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"was such that a reader’s report–so important in deciding the fate of a book–wasdelegated to the only person in the company who spoke Portuguese, an administrativesecretary, who was responsible for the book’s rejection.Destiny, however, seems to have decided that the literary future of Paulo Coelho inFrance would lie with the Laffont family anyway. At the beginning of 1993, Robert’sdaughter Anne had left her position as adviser in her father’s company to set up her ownpublishing house, the tiny Éditions Anne Carrière. This was not a hobby to fill her timebut a business in which she and her husband, Alain, had invested all their money and forwhich they still had to beg loans from banks, friends and relatives. The company wasnot yet three months old when Brigitte Gregony, Anne’s cousin and best friend (and oneof the investors who had put money into the new publishing house), telephoned fromBarcelona, where she was on holiday, to say that she had read the Spanish translation‘of a fascinating book called El Alquimista, written by an unknown Brazilian’. Unableto read a word of Spanish or Portuguese, Anne simply relied upon her cousin’s opinion(and a quick reading by her son, Stephen, who knew a little Spanish), and asked her tofind out whether the publishing rights were held by anyone in France. When she foundMônica, Brigitte learned that The Alchemist was coming out in the United States in Mayand that the agent would send her a copy as soon as it was published.Anne appeared prepared to put all her energies into the project. Although sheoffered a mere US$5,000 advance on royalties, to compensate she called upon a toptranslator, Jean Orecchioni, who had translated the entire works of Jorge Amado intoFrench. Brigitte, who had been the fairy godmother of the publication, did not live longenough to see the success of The Alchemist in France: in July, before the book wasready, she died of a brain tumour. Many years later, Anne Carrière dedicated hermemoirs to her, Une chance infinie: l’histoire d’une amitié (Éditions la Table Ronde),in which she talks about her relationship with Paulo Coelho and reveals the behind-the-scenes story of how he came to be the most successful Latin-American writer in France.The wheels of the publishing business grind exceedingly slow all over the world,and the launch of the book was pushed forward to March 1994, when Paulo was about topublish his fifth title in Brazil, Na Margem do Rio Piedra eu Sentei e Chorei, or By theRiver Piedra I Sat Down and Wept. Anne was faced by a double problem: how to launchthe book of an unknown author published by an equally unknown publishing house?How to make booksellers stop to look at one book among thousands? She decided toproduce a special, numbered edition of The Alchemist, which would be sent to 500French booksellers a month before its launch. On the fourth page of the book was ashort statement written by her: ‘Paulo Coelho is a Brazilian author famous throughoutLatin America. The Alchemist tells the story of a young shepherd who leaves hishomeland to follow a dream: the search for a treasure hidden at the foot of thepyramids. In the desert he will come to understand the language of signs and themeaning of life and, most important of all, he will learn to let his heart speak. He will"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"fulfil his destiny.’ On the book’s spine was a sentence used by HarperCollins for thelaunch in the United States: ‘The Alchemist is a magical book. Reading this book is likegetting up at dawn and seeing the sun rise while the rest of the world is still sleeping.’While half the road to success was guaranteed by the booksellers’ favourablereception, the other half would be determined by the critics, whose reaction could nothave been better. The most important of the French newspapers and magazines, amongthem Le Nouvel Observateur (which, years later, became a harsh critic of the author),carried highly favourable reviews, as Anne Carrière describes in her memoirs:With what appears to be a simple tale, Paulo Coelho soothes the hearts of menand makes them reflect upon the world around them. A fascinating book thatsows the seeds of good sense in the mind and opens up the heart.(Annette Colin Simard, Le Journal du Dimanche)Paulo Coelho is a testament to the virtue of clarity, which makes his writinglike a cool stream flowing beneath cool trees, a path of energy along which heleads the reader, all unwitting, towards himself and his mysterious, distantsoul.(Christian Charrière, L’Express)It is a rare book, like an unexpected treasure that one should savour and share.(Sylvie Genevoix, L’Express)It is a book that does one good.(Danièle Mazingarbe, Madame Figaro)Written in a simple, very pure language, this story of a journey of initiationacross the desert–where, at every step, one sign leads to another, where all themysteries of the world meet in an emerald, where one finds ‘the soul of theworld’, where there is a dialogue with the wind and the sun–literally envelopsone.(Annie Copperman, Les Échos)The joy of his narrative overcomes our preconceptions.

The cautious initial print run of 4,000 copies ran out in the bookshops in amatter of days and at the end of April, when 18,000 copies had been sold, The Alchemistappeared for the first time on a best-seller list in the weekly Livres Hebdo. Intended forthe publishing world, this was not a publication for the public at large and the book wasgiven only twentieth place, but, as Mônica had predicted, this was just the start. In May,The Alchemist was in ninth place in the most important best-seller list, that of theweekly magazine L’Express, where it remained for an incredible 300 consecutiveweeks. The book was a success in several countries besides Brazil, but its acclaim in theUnited States and France would mean that the author would no longer be consideredmerely a Latin-American eccentricity and would become a worldwide phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27World fameWHILE THE WORLD WAS BOWING THE KNEE to Paulo Coelho, the Brazilian criticsremained faithful to the maxim coined by the composer Tom Jobim, according to which‘in Brazil someone else’s success is felt as a personal affront, a slap in the face’, andthey continued to belittle his books. The massive success of The Alchemist in Franceseems to have encouraged him to confront his critics. ‘Before, my detractors couldconclude, wrongly, that Brazilians were fools because they read me,’ he declared to thejournalist Napoleão Sabóia of O Estado de São Paulo. ‘Now that my books are sellingso well abroad, it’s hard to universalize that accusation of stupidity.’ Not so. For thecritic Silviano Santiago, who had a PhD in literature from the Sorbonne, being a best-seller even in a country like France meant absolutely nothing. ‘It’s important todemystify his success in France,’ he told Veja. ‘The French public is as mediocre and aslacking in sophistication as the general public anywhere.’ Some did not even go to thetrouble of opening Paulo’s books in order to condemn them. ‘I’ve not read them and Idon’t like them’ was the judgement given by Davi Arrigucci, Jr, another respected criticand professor of literature at the University of São Paulo. However, none of this seemedto matter to Paulo’s Brazilian readers, still less his foreign ones. On the contrary.Judging by the numbers, his army of readers and admirers seemed to be growing in thesame proportion as the virulence of his critics. The situation was to be repeated in 1994when, as well as By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept, he launched a 190-pagebook, Maktub–a collection of the mini-chronicles, fables and reflections he had beenpublishing in the Folha de São Paulo since 1993.Just as The Valkyries had been inspired by the penance Paulo and Chris hadundertaken in 1988 in the Mojave Desert, in By the River Piedra I Sat Down and WeptPaulo shares with his readers yet another spiritual experience, the Road to Rome, whichhe undertook in the south of France, partly in the company of Mônica Antunes. In the236 pages of the book, he describes seven days in the life of Pilar, a twenty-nine-year-old student who is struggling to complete her studies in Zaragoza in Spain and whomeets up again with a colleague with whom she’d had an adolescent affair. The meetingtakes place after a conference organized by the young man–who remains nameless inthe book, as do all the other characters apart from the protagonist. Now a seminarianand a devotee of the Immaculate Conception, he confesses his love for Pilar during atrip from Madrid to Lourdes.

As had been thecase with all five of his previous books, both Rio Piedra and Maktub were torn apart bythe Brazilian media. The critic Geraldo Galvão Ferraz, of the São Paulo Jornal daTarde, branded By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept as ‘a poorly mixed cocktail ofmediocre mysticism, religion and fiction, full of clichés and stereotypical characterswho spend the greater part of their time giving solemn speeches’. The author’s approachto what he calls ‘the feminine side of God’ was ridiculed by another journalist as ‘aPaulo Coelho for girls’. The magazine Veja handed the review of Maktub to DiogoMainardi, who derided certain passages, comparing Maktub to a pair of dirty socks thathe had left in his car:In truth all this nonsense would mean nothing if Paulo Coelho were merely acharlatan who earns a little money from other people’s stupidity. I would neverwaste my time reviewing a mediocre author if he simply produced theoccasional manual of esoteric clichés. However, things aren’t quite like that. Atthe last Frankfurt Book Fair, the theme of which was Brazil, Paulo Coelho wasmarketed as a real writer, as a legitimate representative of Brazilian literature.That really is too much. However bad our writers might be, they’re still betterthan Paulo Coelho. He can do what he likes, but he shouldn’t present himself asa writer. When all’s said and done, there’s about as much literature in PauloCoelho as there is in my dirty socks.As on previous occasions, such reviews had no effect whatsoever on sales. Whilederided in the pages of newspapers and magazines, By the River Piedra I Sat Down andWept sold 70,000 copies on the first day, more than The Valkyries. Some weeks after itslaunch, Maktub also appeared in the best-seller lists. The only difference was that thistime, the victim of the attacks was thousands of kilometres from Rio, travelling throughFrance with Anne Carrière in response to dozens of invitations for talks and debateswith his growing number of French readers.Despite the enormous success achieved by the author, Paulo’s presence at theFrankfurt Book Fair in 1994, the first in which he had taken part, had made it clear thatpreconceptions about his work were not just the privilege of Brazilian critics but also ofhis fellow writers. Although the position of Minister of Culture was, at the time, held by"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"an old friend of the author’s, the diplomat Luiz Roberto do Nascimento e Silva, thebrother of his ex-girlfriend Maria do Rosário, when it came to organizing a party ofeighteen writers to represent Brazilian literature–Brazil was the guest of honour–Paulowas not included. According to Nascimento e Silva, writers were chosen who werepopular with or familiar to German readers. Paulo’s trip, therefore, was paid by EditoraRocco. In order to celebrate the contracts being signed around the world, his Germanpublisher at the time, Peter Erd, owner of the publishing house of the same name, gave acocktail party to which he invited all of Paulo’s publishers present at the book fair and,naturally enough, all the members of the Brazilian delegation. The party was wellattended, but not entirely a success because only two other Brazilian writers werepresent, and of the other delegation members, only Chico Buarque was polite enough tophone to give his excuses, since he would be giving a talk at the same time. A lonevoice, that of Jorge Amado, who was not part of the delegation, spoke out loudly inPaulo’s defence: ‘The only thing that makes Brazilian intellectuals attack Paulo Coelhois his success.’ In spite of this, in 1995, the fever that the British magazine PublishingNews called ‘Coelhomania’ and the French media ‘Coelhisme’ reached pandemicproportions. Sought out by the French director Claude Lelouch and then by theAmerican Quentin Tarantino, both of whom were interested in adapting The Alchemistfor the cinema, Paulo replied that the giant American Warner Brothers had got therefirst and bought the rights for US$300,000. Roman Polanski had told journalists that hehoped to be able to film The Valkyries. In May, when Anne Carrière was preparing forthe launch of an edition of The Alchemist to be illustrated by Moebius, HQ, owners ofHachette and Elle, announced that the Elle Grand Prix for Literature that year had beenawarded to Paulo Coelho. This caused such a stir that he earned the privilege of beingfeatured in the ‘Portrait’ section of the magazine Lire, the bible of the French literaryworld.But the crowning glory came in October. After thirty-seven weeks in second place,The Alchemist dethroned Le Premier Homme, an unfinished novel by Albert Camus, andwent on to head the best-seller list in L’Express. Two famous critics compared TheAlchemist to another national glory, Le Petit Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. ‘I hadthe same feeling when I read both books,’ wrote Frédéric Vitoux in his column in themagazine Le Nouvel Observateur. ‘I was enchanted by the sensibility and the freshness,the innocence of soul.’ His colleague Eric Deschot, of the weekly Actuel, shared hisopinion: ‘It is not a sacrilegious comparison, since the simplicity, transparency andpurity of this fable remind me of the mystery of Saint-Exupéry’s story.’Paulo received news that he had leapt into first place in L’Express while he was inthe Far East, where he had gone with Chris to take part in a series of launches anddebates with readers. One afternoon, as the shinkansen, the Japanese bullet train takingthem from Nagoia to Tokyo, was speeding past the snow-covered Mount Fuji, the writermade a decision: when he returned to Brazil, he would change publishers. The decision"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"was not the result of some sign that only he had noticed: it came after a long period ofreflection on his relationship with Rocco. Among other disagreements, Paulo wasdemanding a distribution system that would open up sales outlets other than bookshops,such as newspaper stands and supermarkets, so that his books could reach readers onlower incomes. Rocco had asked for a study by Fernando Chinaglia, an experiencednewspaper and magazine distributor, but the plan went no further. On 15 February 1995,the columnist Zózimo Barroso do Amaral published a note in O Globo informing hisreaders that ‘one of the most envied marriages in the literary world’ was coming to anend.The other newspapers picked up the scoop and some days later, the entire countryknew that, for US$1 million, Paulo Coelho was moving from Rocco to Editora Objetiva,who would publish his next book, O Monte Cinco, or The Fifth Mountain. This vastsum–more than had ever been paid to any other Brazilian author–would not all go intohis pocket, but would be divided up more or less as it had been with Rocco: 55 per centas an advance on royalties and the remaining 45 per cent to be invested in publicity.This was a big gamble for Roberto Feith, a journalist, economist and ex-internationalcorrespondent with the television network Globo, who had taken control of Objetivafive years earlier. The US$550,000 advance represented 15 per cent of the publisher’sentire turnover, which came mostly from sales of its three ‘big names’, Stephen King,Harold Bloom and Daniel Goleman. The experts brought in by the firm were unanimousin stating that if The Fifth Mountain were to repeat the success of By the River Piedra ISat Down and Wept, Objetiva would get the US$1 million investment back within amatter of months. Apparently the change caused no resentment on the part of his ex-publisher, for although Paulo had moved to Objetiva, he left with Rocco his entirebacklist, the profitable collection of seven books published there since 1989. In fact, amonth after announcing the move, Paulo Rocco was among the author’s guests atPaulo’s traditional celebration of St Joseph’s feast day on 19 March.Inspired by a passage from the Bible (1 Kings 18:8–24), The Fifth Mountain tells ofthe suffering, doubts and spiritual discoveries of the prophet Elijah during his exile inSarepta in Phoenicia, present-day Lebanon. The city, whose residents were welleducated and famous for their commercial acumen, had not known war for 300 years,but it was about to be invaded by the Assyrians. The prophet encounters religiousconflicts, and is forced to face the anger both of men and of God. In the prologue, Pauloonce again reveals how he interweaves his personal experiences with the themes of hisbooks. When he states that, with The Fifth Mountain, he had perhaps learned tounderstand and live with the inevitable, he recalls his dismissal from CBS seventeenyears earlier, which had brought to an end a promising career as an executive in therecording industry:When I finished writing The Fifth Mountain, I recalled that episode–and other"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"manifestations of the unavoidable in my life. Whenever I thought myself theabsolute master of a situation, something would happen to cast me down. Iasked myself: why? Can it be that I’m condemned to always come close butnever to reach the finishing line? Can God be so cruel that He would let me seethe palm trees on the horizon only to have me die of thirst in the desert? It tooka long time to understand that it wasn’t quite like that. There are things that arebrought into our lives to lead us back to the true path of our Personal Legend.Other things arise so we can apply all that we have learned. And, finally, somethings come along to teach us.The book was ready to be delivered to Editora Objetiva when Paulo unearthedinformation on periods in Elijah’s life that had not been dealt with in the Scriptures, or,more precisely, about the time he had spent in Phoenicia. This exciting discovery meantthat he had to rewrite almost the entire book, which was finally published in August1996 during the fourteenth São Paulo Book Biennial. The launch was preceded by ahuge publicity campaign run by the São Paulo agency Salles/DMB&B, whose owner,the advertising executive Mauro Salles, was an old friend and informal guru onmarketing matters, and the book’s dedicatee. The campaign included full-pageadvertisements in the four principal national newspapers (Jornal do Brasil, Folha deSão Paulo, O Estado de São Paulo and O Globo) and in the magazines Veja-Rio, Veja-SP, Caras, Claudia and Contigo, 350 posters on Rio and São Paulo buses, eightyhoardings in Rio, and displays, sales points and plastic banners in bookshops. Inspiredby Anne Carrière’s idea, which had worked so well in the French launch of TheAlchemist, Paulo suggested and Feith ordered a special edition of numbered,autographed copies of The Fifth Mountain to be distributed to 400 bookshops acrossBrazil a week before the ordinary edition reached the public. In order to prevent anydisclosure to the press, every recipient had to sign a confidentiality agreement.The result was proportionate to the effort invested. The books were distributed on 8August and in less than twenty-four hours 80,000 of the 100,000 copies of the firstedition had been sold. Another 11,000 were sold in the week of the Book Biennial,where seemingly endless queues of readers awaited Paulo and where he signed copiesfor ten hours non-stop. The Fifth Mountain had barely been out for two months whensales rose to 120,000 copies, meaning that the publisher had already recouped theUS$550,000 advance paid to the author. The remaining US$450,000 that had been spentwould be recouped during the following months.In the case of The Fifth Mountain, the critics appeared to be showing signs ofsoftening. ‘Let’s leave it to the magi to judge whether Coelho is a sorcerer or acharlatan, that’s not what matters,’ wrote the Folha de São Paulo. ‘The fact is that hecan tell stories that are easily digested, with no literary athletics, and that delightreaders in dozens of languages.’ In its main competitor, O Estado de São Paulo, the"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"critic and writer José Castello did not hold back either. ‘The neat, concise style of TheFifth Mountain proves that his pen has grown sharper and more precise,’ he said in hisreview in the cultural supplement. ‘Whether or not you like his books, Paulo Coelho isstill the victim of terrible prejudices–the same [...] which, if you transfer them to thereligious field, have drowned the planet in blood.’ A week before the launch, even theirascible Veja seemed to have bowed to the evidence and devoted a long andsympathetic article to him, entitled ‘The Smile of the Magus’, at the end of which itpublished an exclusive excerpt from The Fifth Mountain. However, in the middle of thistorrent of praise, the magazine summarized the content of Coelho’s work as ‘ingenuousstories whose “message” usually has all the philosophical depth of a Karate Kid film’.At the following launch, however, when Manual do Guerreiro da Luz, or Manual ofthe Warrior of Light, came out, the critics returned with renewed appetite. This was thefirst of Paulo’s books to be published abroad before coming out in Brazil, and was theresult of a suggestion from Elisabetta Sgarbi, of the Italian publisher Bompiani.Encouraged by the success of the author’s books in Italy, she went to Mônica to seewhether he might have any unpublished work for the Assagi collection, which Bompianihad just created. Coelho had for some time been thinking of collecting together variousnotes and reflections recorded over the years into one book, and this was perhaps theright moment. Some of these had already been published in the Folha de São Paulo, andthis led him to stick to the same eleven-line limit imposed by the newspaper. Usingmetaphors, symbolism and religious and medieval references, Paulo reveals to readershis experiences during what he calls ‘my process of spiritual growth’. In his view, theManual was such a fusion between author and work that it became the ‘key book’ tounderstanding his universe. ‘Not so much the world of magic, but above all theideological world,’ he says. ‘Manual of the Warrior of Light has the same importancefor me as the Red Book had for Mao or the Green Book for Gaddafi.’ The term ‘Warriorof Light’–someone who is always actively trying to realize his dream, regardless ofwhat obstacles are placed in his way–can be found in several of his books, including TheAlchemist, The Valkyries and By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept. And shouldthere remain any doubts as to its meaning, the home page of the author’s then recentlycreated website took on the task of responding to those doubts: ‘This book bringstogether a series of texts written to remind us that in every one of us there is a Warriorof Light. Someone capable of listening to the silence of his heart, of accepting defeatswithout allowing himself to be weakened by them and of nourishing hope in the midstof dejection and fatigue.’When it was launched in Brazil, the Manual was preceded by the success of thebook in Italy, but this did not seem to impress the Brazilian critics–not even the Folhade São Paulo, which had originally published several of the mini-articles reproduced inthe book. In a short, two-column review, the young journalist Fernando Barros e Silva,one of the newspaper’s editors, referred to the launch as ‘the most recent mystical"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"spasm from our greatest publishing phenomenon’ and dismissed the author in the firstlines of his article:Paulo Coelho is not a writer, not even a lousy writer. There’s no point in callingwhat he does ‘subliterature’. That would be praise indeed. His model is moreEdir Macedo [the ‘bishop’ of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]than Sidney Sheldon. [...] Having said that, let us turn to the book itself. Thereis nothing new. The secret, as ever, lies in lining up platitudes so that the readercan read what best suits him. As with the I Ching, this is about ‘illuminating’routes, ‘suggesting’ truths by using vague metaphors, sentences that are socloudy and surrounded by metaphysical smoke that they are capable of sayingeverything precisely because they say absolutely nothing. [...] Every cliché fitsinto this successful formula: an ecological and idyllic description of nature,allusions to interminable conflicts between good and evil, touches of Christianguilt and redemption–all stitched together in a flat, unpolished language thatseems to be the work of an eight-year-old child and is aimed at people of thesame mental age. Each time you read Paulo Coelho, even with care andattention, you become more stupid and worse than you were before.Such reviews only proved to the author the tiresome and repetitive abyss that separatedthe views of the critics from the behaviour of his readers. As had been the case since hisvery first book–and as would be the case with the rest–despite being ridiculed innewspapers such as the Folha de São Paulo, the Manual appeared a few days later in allthe best-seller lists. Paulo went on to achieve something that probably no other authorever had: being number one in best-seller lists of both non-fiction (in this case in OGlobo) and fiction (in the Jornal do Brasil). Things were no different in the rest of theworld: the Manual was translated into twenty-nine languages, and in Italy it sold morethan a million copies, becoming, after The Alchemist and Eleven Minutes, the mostsuccessful of the author’s books there–and a decade after its launch by Bompiani it stillhad an average sale of 100,000 copies a year. Its popularity in Italy became such that atthe end of 1997, the designer Donatella Versace announced that her collection for 1998had taken its inspiration from Coelho’s book. In France, The Alchemist had sold twomillion copies and By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept 240,000, which led AnneCarrière to buy the publishing rights to The Fifth Mountain for US$150,000. Somemonths before, the author had been overwhelmed to receive from the Frenchgovernment the title of Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. ‘You are analchemist for millions of readers who say that you write books that do good,’ the FrenchMinister of Culture, Philippe Douste-Blazy, said as he presented him with the medal.‘Your books do good because they stimulate our power to dream, our desire to seek and"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"to believe in that search.’Some Brazilians, however, continued to turn their noses up at their compatriot, forwhom the red carpet was rolled out wherever he walked. This attitude was made evenmore explicit at the beginning of 1998, when it was announced that Brazil was to beguest of honour at the 18th Salon du Livre de Paris to be held between 19 and 25 Marchthat year. The Brazilian Minister of Culture, Francisco Weffort, had given the presidentof the National Library, the academic Eduardo Portela, the task of organizing the groupof writers who would take part in the event as guests of the Brazilian government.Following several weeks of discussion, only ten days before the event the press receivedthe list of the fifty authors who were to spend a week in Paris. Exactly as had happenedfour years earlier in Frankfurt, Paulo Coelho’s name was not among those invited. Itwas a pointless insult by a government that the author had supported. Invited, instead,by his publisher, he spent the afternoon of the opening day signing copies of the Frenchtranslation of The Fifth Mountain, which had an initial run of 250,000 copies (hardlytoo many for someone who had already sold five million books in France).In fact, the author had arrived in Paris a week before the Brazilian delegation andbeen faced with a plethora of interviews with newspapers, magazines and no fewer thansix different French television programmes. Finally, on 19 March, to the sound of anoisy Brazilian percussion group, President Jacques Chirac and the Brazilian First Lady,who was representing her husband, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, officiallydeclared the salon open and, surrounded by a crowd of journalists and security guards,walked along some of the aisles down the centre of the Paris Expo convention centrewhere the event was being held. At one point, to the dismay of the Brazilian contingent,President Chirac made a point of going over to the Éditions Anne Carrière stand, shookhands with the publisher and, with an enormous smile on his face, warmly embracedPaulo Coelho. He heaped praise on, as it was later discovered, the only Brazilian authorhe had read and on whom, two years later, he would bestow the Légion d’Honneur–anhonour previously given to such international celebrities as Winston Churchill, JohnKennedy and even some famous Brazilians, such as Santos Dumont, Pelé and OscarNiemeyer. Before moving on, Chirac then turned to Anne Carrière, saying: ‘You musthave made a lot of money with Monsieur Coelho’s books. Congratulations!’The following day, the Salon du Livre de Paris opened to the public and waswitness to another world record: an author signing autographs for seven hours non-stopapart from short trips to the toilet or to smoke a cigarette. However, the best was yet tocome for Anne Carrière. Some days before the close of the event, she took over theCarrousel du Louvre, an elegant, exclusive gallery beneath the famous Paris museumwhere shows were held by the famous European fashion houses. There Paulo hosted abanquet to which he invited booksellers, publishers, journalists and famousintellectuals. Throwing down the gauntlet to those who had snubbed him, the host madesure that every member of the Brazilian delegation received a personal invitation to the"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"dinner. One of these was the journalist and writer Zuenir Ventura, who had justpublished a book entitled, appropriately enough, Inveja [Envy]. He recalled Paulo’sconcern that the Brazilians were being well looked after: ‘He didn’t eat, he went roundto every table. Although at the time, he had everyone who mattered in the literary worldat his feet, Paulo was exactly the same person as ever. When he came to my table,instead of talking about himself, he wanted to know how my book Inveja was going,whether I had any translation offers, whether he could help...’When it came to the time for toasts, the author asked the band to stop playing for awhile so that he could speak. Visibly moved and speaking in good French, he thankedeveryone for being there, heaped praise on his Brazilian colleagues and dedicated theevening to one absentee: ‘I should like this night of celebration to be an homage fromall of us to the greatest and best of all Brazilian writers, my dear friend Jorge Amado, towhom I ask you all to raise your glasses.’Then, to the sound of Brazilian music, the 600 guests turned the hallowed marblerooms of the Carrousel into a dance floor and danced the samba into the early hours. Ontheir return to the hotel, Paulo had yet another surprise: a special edition of The FifthMountain, produced for the occasion. Each book in its own velvet case contained thesame sentence, written in French and signed by the author: ‘Perseverance andspontaneity are the paradoxical conditions of the personal legend.’ When Paulo boardedthe plane back to Brazil, three weeks after landing in Paris, 200,000 copies of The FifthMountain had been bought by the French public.Now firmly and comfortably established as one of the most widely sold authors inthe world, Paulo Coelho became an object of interest in the academic world. One of thefirst essayists to turn his attention to his work was Professor Mario Maestri of theUniversity of Passo Fundo, in Rio Grande do Sul, the author of a study in 1993 in whichhe had recognized that Coelho’s books ‘belong by right to the national literary-fictionalcorpus’. Six years later, however, when he published his book Why Paulo Coelho IsSuccessful, Maestri seems to have been infected by the ill will of literary critics:Replete with proverbs, aphorisms and simplistic stories, full of commonplacesand clichés, Paulo Coelho’s early fiction nevertheless has an important role inself-help. It allows readers demoralized by a wretched day-to-day existence todream of achieving happiness swiftly and as if by magic. The worn-out modernesoteric suggests to his readers easy ways–within the reach of all–of takingpositive action in their own lives and in the world, usually in order to gainmaterial and personal advantage. It is essentially a magical route to the virtualuniverse of a consumer society.The many MA and PhD theses being written throughout the country confirmed that,"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"apart from a few exceptions, Brazilian universities were as hostile towards the writer asthe Brazilian media. This feeling became public in a report published in the Jornal doBrasil in 1998, in which the newspaper described the experience of Otacília Rodriguesde Freitas, literature professor at the University of São Paulo, who had faced fiercecriticism when she defended a doctoral thesis entitled ‘A best-seller from the reader’spoint of view: The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho’–a thesis considered by her colleagues tobe sympathetic towards the author. The professor told the Jornal do Brasil indignantly:‘They said that Paulo Coelho had paid me to write the thesis, that I was his mistress.’Indifferent to what academics might think of his work, Paulo was preparing onceagain to face the whirlwind of activity that now accompanied the launch of each newbook. Set in Slovenia, the story of Veronika Decide Morrer, or Veronika Decides to Die,has as its backdrop the romance between Eduard, the son of a diplomat, and theeponymous heroine who, after attempting suicide, is placed in a mental asylum by herparents and subjected to brutal electroshock treatment. The explosive nature of the booklay in Paulo’s revelation that he had been admitted to the Dr Eiras clinic in Rio duringthe 1960s on three separate occasions, something he had never spoken about in publicbefore. By doing so, he was breaking an oath he had made that he would deal with thesubject in public only after the death of his parents. His mother had died five yearsearlier, in 1993, of complications arising from Alzheimer’s disease, and he had beenunable to be at her funeral because he received the news while he was in Canada,working on the launch of The Alchemist, and was unable to get back to Brazil in time.Although his energetic father, Pedro, was not only alive but, as he appears in the book,‘in full enjoyment of his mental faculties and his health’, Veronika Decides to Dieexposes in no uncertain terms the violence to which the author was subjected by hisfather and his late mother. ‘Veronika is Paulo Coelho’, the author declared to whoeverwanted to listen.Concerned as always that his books should reach poorer readers, this time hedecided to change his launch tactics. He told Objetiva to cut by half the US$450,000spent on advertising The Fifth Mountain, thus allowing a reduction of almost 25 percent on the cover price. Another move intended to make his work more accessible was acontract with the supermarket chain Carrefour, which included Veronika in itspromotional package of presents for Father’s Day. The book’s publication coincidedwith an intense debate in Brazil about the treatment of people being held in public andprivate mental asylums. The Senate was discussing a bill drawn up to bring about thegradual eradication of institutions where patients with mental problems were held asvirtual prisoners, and during that debate, passages of Veronika were read out. On theday on which the vote was to be held and the law ratified, Senator Eduardo Suplicyquoted from a letter he had received from Paulo Coelho in praise of the bill: ‘Havingbeen a victim in the past of the violence of these baseless admissions to mentalhospitals–I was committed to the Casa de Saúde Dr Eiras in 1965, ’66 and ’67–I see this"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"new law not only as opportune, but as absolutely necessary.’ Together with the letter theauthor sent a copy of the records of his admissions to the clinic. Two years later, Paulowas invited to join the team of the International Russell Tribunal on Psychiatry, aninstitution created by the European Parliament, and in 2003, he was one of the speakersat a seminar on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Persons with MentalHealth Problems organized by the European Committee on Human Rights.Veronika broke all Paulo’s previous records. What was new was the respectfultreatment accorded to the book by the media. Perhaps moved by the shockingrevelations contained in the book, the newspapers and magazines devoted pages andpages to accounts of the horror of his three internments.One of the few dissenting voices was that of a friend of his, the writer and journalistMarcelo Rubem Paiva. Asked by the Folha de São Paulo to review Veronika, he did sotongue in cheek and even suggested stylistic changes to the text, only to pull himself upshort: ‘What am I saying? Here I am giving tips to a writer who has sold millions andwon commendations and prizes abroad!’Exactly. To judge by all those sales, prizes and commendations, it would seem thathis readers preferred his texts as they were. Immediately following the publication ofVeronika in Brazil, the journalist and professor Denis de Moraes published an essayentitled The Big Four. These were Stephen King, Michael Crichton, John Grisham andTom Clancy. Moraes used a list of Paulo’s achievements and engagements in 1998 toshow that the Brazilian already had a foot in that select group of world best-sellers:He spoke about spirituality at the Economic Forum in Davos, in Switzerland.He was granted an audience at the Vatican and blessed by Pope John PaulII.He beat the world record for a book signing at the eighteenth Salon duLivre de Paris with The Fifth Mountain, which has sold almost 300,000 copiesin France.He recorded a statement for the documentary The Phenomenon, based onhis life, for a Canadian/French/American co-production.His book Manual of the Warrior of Light inspired the 1998/1999 Versacecollection.He spent a week in Britain publicizing The Fifth Mountain.On his return to Rio de Janeiro in May, he gave interviews to the CanadianTV5 and to the English newspapers the Sunday Times and the Guardian.Between August and October, he undertook engagements in New Zealand,Australia, Japan, Israel and Yugoslavia.He returned to Rio for interviews with French and German television,before setting off for a series of launches in Eastern Europe (Poland, the CzechRepublic, Slovakia, Slovenia and Bulgaria)."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"Before returning to Brazil for the end-of-year festivities he went to Finlandand Russia.Hollywood wants to adapt four of his books for the cinema.The French actress Isabelle Adjani is fighting Julia Roberts for the filmrights to By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept.The Arenas Group, with links to Sony Entertainment, wants to bring TheValkyries to the screen, while Virgin is interested in The Pilgrimage.Awarded the Ordem do Rio Branco by President Fernando HenriqueCardoso.Named special UN envoy for the Spiritual Convergence and InterculturalDialogue programme.All this feverish travelling was interrupted only in 2000, when he finished his new book,O Demónio e a Srta. Prym, or The Devil and Miss Prym. The launch this time was ratherdifferent. Firstly, the author decided to stay at home (the book was launchedsimultaneously in Brazil and other countries), preferring to receive foreign journalistsin his new apartment in Copacabana. This was an apartment occupying an entire floor,which he had transformed into a vast bedroom-cum-sitting room, for which he had paidabout US$350,000 and from where he enjoyed a wonderful view of Brazil’s mostfamous beach. The idea of asking journalists to come to him had arisen some weeksearlier, when the North American television network CNN International recorded a longinterview with him that was shown in 230 countries.During the weeks that followed, at the invitation of his agent, teams from all themajor newspapers and television stations began to arrive in Rio from Germany,Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Spain, France, Greece, England, Italy,Mexico, Portugal and the Czech Republic. Many used the trip to Brazil to file reports onRio de Janeiro as well, and Mônica commented: ‘That amount of publicity would havecost the Prefecture of Rio a fortune.’ The other unusual thing about the launch in Brazilwas the choice of venue. Coelho preferred to hold it in the Brazilian Academy ofLetters. You didn’t have to be very sharp to guess what this choice meant: PauloCoelho, who had been so mistreated by Brazilian critics, clearly had his eye on a seat inthe Olympus of Brazilian literature."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28Becoming an ‘immortal’THE DEVIL AND MISS PRYM was not the book Coelho had wanted to publish at the turn ofthe millennium. He had written a novel about sex, which had been carefully checked byMônica and a friend of the author, the theologian and ex-impresario Chico Castro Silva,but it did not survive Chris’s reading of it, and, as with his book on satanism, sherefused to give it her approval.This was not the first time he had been down this route. At the end of the 1980s, alittle after publishing The Alchemist in Brazil, he had tried to write a book in which hetreated sex with a starkness rarely found in literature. Between January and March 1989,he produced a 100-page novel telling the story of a man who is identified simply as‘D.’, with the book being given the provisional title A Magia do Sexo, A Glória de Deus[The Magic of Sex, The Glory of God] or, simply, Conversas com D.[Conversations withD].Tormented by doubts about his sexuality, the main character is only able to findsexual satisfaction with his wife, but has terrible dreams in which he sees his mothernaked and being abused by several men who, having raped her, urinate over her. Whattroubles the forty-year-old D. is not just the nightmare in itself but also the fact thatwitnessing this violence gives him pleasure. Lost in the midst of these terrible fantasies,D. starts to tell his problems to a friend, who becomes the narrator of the plot. The twomeet every evening for a beer. As he describes his innermost secrets and insecurities, D.ends up confessing that, although he is not homosexual, he experiences enormouspleasure when dreaming that he is being raped by men (‘I like the humiliation of beingon all fours, submissive, giving pleasure to the other man’). Coelho never finishedConversas com D., and it ends without one knowing what fate the author will choose forthe central character–whose story bears a certain resemblance to his own. The bookended up in the trunk full of diaries that Coelho had said should be burned after hisdeath.The Devil and Miss Prym arose from a visit Coelho made to the French town ofViscos, on the Spanish frontier. In the main square, he saw a strange sculpture in whichthe water flowed out of a sun and into the mouth of a toad, and, however much hequizzed the inhabitants, no one could explain to him the significance of this oddcreation. The image remained in his head for months, until he decided to use it as arepresentation of Good and Evil. With The Devil and Miss Prym, Coelho wascompleting a trilogy that he called ‘And on the Seventh Day’, which began with By the"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept (1994) and was followed by Veronika (1998).According to him, ‘they are three books that describe a week in the life of normalpeople who suddenly find themselves confronted by love, death and power’.The story takes place in a small imaginary village of 281 inhabitants, all of whomare believed to be extremely honest. The village routine is interrupted by the arrival ofCarlos, a foreigner who is at once identified by the widow Berta, the eldest of theinhabitants, as someone bringing evil to their peaceful town, i.e., the Devil. The strangerstays in a hotel where the only single woman in town, Chantal Prym, works in the snackbar. Miss Prym is an orphan and rather frowned on by the other inhabitants, and she ischosen by the visitor as an instrument to test their honesty. Presenting himself as abusinessman who has lost his wife and two daughters to a dreadful crime, themysterious Carlos offers the young woman the chance to become rich and leave thetedious life of the town. In exchange, she must help him to convince the localinhabitants to take part in a macabre competition: if, within a week, someone cancommit the motiveless murder of at least one local inhabitant, the town will receive tenbars of gold which he has hidden in a secret place. The book deals with the conflictsgenerated by this extraordinary offer and concludes by identifying the possiblesimultaneous existence within every human soul of a personal angel and a personaldevil.In March 2000, after delivering The Devil and Miss Prym to Editora Objetiva, Paulotook a plane to Paris in time to see the start of the huge publicity campaign organizedby Anne Carrière for the launch of Veronika Decides to Die. On a cold, grey Mondaymorning, along with the millions of Parisians and tourists who daily cross the city, hewas shown a number 87 bus bearing a gigantic close-up of his face printed against ablue backdrop, announcing that Veronika was in all the bookshops. The number 87buses departed from Porte de Reuilly, to the east of the capital, and travelled some 30kilometres through the streets until reaching their final stop in Champs de Mars, havingpassed through some of the busiest areas of Paris, such as Gare de Lyon, the Bastilleand St Germain-des-Près. The same scene was being repeated in fourteen other Frenchcities. This time, however, the publicity campaign did not produce the hoped-for results.The reaction of French readers was lukewarm, perhaps because they found it odd to seea book being advertised like soap or toothpaste. Although it sold more than the previousbooks, the sales of Veronika in France were below expectations. Even so, the book waswarmly received by the French press, including L’Express and the serious andconservative Figaro, one of the most influential newspapers in the country. At the sametime, although without the same fanfare, Veronika was beginning to arrive in bookshopsin Taiwan, Japan, China, Indonesia, Thailand and the United States.The globalization of his literary success was finally introducing the author toanother circle–the international jet set. As he had been doing since 1998, Coelho hadtaken part in the World Economic Forum some weeks earlier. The forum is an"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"organization created in 1971 by the professor and economist Klaus Schwab and everyyear it brings together in Davos the elite of world politics and economics (at Schwab’sinvitation, the author has been a member of the Schwab Foundation since 2000). Themost important guest at the 2000 meeting, the American President Bill Clinton, hadbeen photographed some months earlier clutching a copy of The Alchemist as he steppedout of a helicopter in the gardens of the White House. On hearing that Paulo was inDavos as well, Clinton took the opportunity to meet him. ‘It was my daughter Chelseawho gave me the book–in fact she ordered me to read it,’ the President joked. ‘I liked itso much that I gave it to Hillary to read as well,’ he went on, ending the meeting with aninvitation that would not in fact be followed up: ‘Let me know if you’re visiting theUnited States. If I’m home, my family and I would love to have you over for dinner.’Seven years later, in 2007, at the request of Hillary Clinton’s team, Paulo produced atext in support of her candidature for nomination for the presidency of the UnitedStates.The meeting in Davos in 2000 and in subsequent years meant that he couldpersonally meet some of his most famous readers–such as the former Israeli primeminister and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Shimon Peres, the American actressSharon Stone and the Italian author Umberto Eco–and could mingle with such world-famous names as Bill Gates and political leaders such as the Palestinian Yasser Arafatand the German Gerhard Schroeder. Interviewed during one of the ‘literary teas’ heldduring the forum, Umberto Eco revealed that he had read Paulo’s works, saying: ‘Myfavourite book by Paulo Coelho is Veronika. It touched me deeply. I confess that I don’tlike The Alchemist very much, because we have different philosophical points of view.Paulo writes for believers, I write for those who don’t believe.’In the second half of 2000, the ‘fever’ predicted by Mônica Antunes ten yearsearlier had spread through all the social, economic and cultural classes regardless ofrace, sex or age, far less ideology. Some months before, the author had been appalled toread in the English newspaper the Guardian that The Alchemist and The Fifth Mountainwere the favourite bedside reading of the Chilean ex-dictator Augusto Pinochet, whowas at the time being held in England at the request of the Spanish courts, accused of‘torture, terrorism and genocide’. He declared to the press: ‘I wonder if GeneralPinochet would continue to read my books if he knew that their author was imprisonedthree times during the Brazilian military regime and had many friends who weredetained in or expelled from Chile during the Chilean military regime.’ Some timelater, when interviewed by the Caracas newspaper El Universal, the Venezuelan MiguelSanabria, the ideological leader of an organization that supported President HugoChávez, revealed the bibliography used in his political degree course: Karl Marx, SimónBolivar, José Carlos Mariátegui and Paulo Coelho. Books by Coelho appeared in thestrangest hands and on the oddest bookshelves, such as those of the Tajik ex-majorVictor Bout, who was captured at the beginning of 2008 in Thailand by American"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"agents. In a rare interview, the retired KGB official, who was considered the biggestarms dealer in the world (and who inspired the film Lord of War, starring NicolasCage), candidly stated to New York Times reporter Peter Landesman that, when notselling anti-aircraft missiles, he would relax by reading Paulo Coelho. In the warlaunched by the United States against the Al Qaeda network, Coelho’s books were readon both sides. According to the British Sunday Times, The Alchemist was the mostborrowed book in the barracks library of the American soldiers of the 10th MountainDivision, who were hunting for Osama Bin Laden in the Afghan caves. And on visitingNumber 4 concentration camp in Guantanamo Bay, where those suspected of havinglinks with Bin Laden were imprisoned, the reporter Patrícia Campos Mello, of O Estadode São Paulo, discovered versions in Farsi of The Pilgrimage among the books offeredto the prisoners by their American gaolers.Coelho himself was surprised when he saw the film Guantanamera, directed by theCuban Tomás Gutiérrez Alea, to see that, on the protagonist’s long trip across the islandin order to bury a relative, he was carrying a copy of The Alchemist. Since his books arenot published in Cuba, he did some research and discovered that it was a Spanish copy,sold on the black market for an incredible US$40. ‘I had no qualms about contacting theCubans and giving up my rights as author, without getting a cent,’ he later toldnewspapers, ‘just so that the books could be published there at lower prices and morepeople could have access to them.’ In an incident that shows that rudeness has noideological colour, in 2007, Paulo was the victim of a gratuitous insult from the CubanMinister of Culture, Abel Prieto, who was responsible for the organization of theHavana Book Fair. ‘We have a problem with Paulo Coelho,’ Prieto declared to a groupof foreign journalists. ‘Although he is a friend of Cuba and speaks out against theblockade, I could not invite him because that would lower the tone of the fair.’ Not aman to take insults lying down, the author paid him back on his Internet blog with a six-paragraph article that was immediately reproduced in the daily El Nuevo Herald, themost important Spanish-language newspaper published in Miami, the heart of anti-Castroism. ‘I am not at all surprised by this statement,’ he wrote. ‘Once bitten by thebug of power, those who have fought for liberty and justice become oppressors.’His international prominence did not distance him from his country of origin. Thechoice of the Brazilian Academy of Letters for the launch of The Devil and Miss Prymin October 2000 was seen as a step towards his entry into the Brazilian Academy. Thiswas not the first such step. When Anne Carrière had organized that dinner at theCarrousel du Louvre in 1998, all the members of the Brazilian delegation in Paris hadbeen invited, but only three writers received personal telephone calls from Pauloreiterating the invitation–Nélida Piñon, Eduardo Portela and the senator and ex-president of the Republic José Sarney. Needless to say, all three were members of theAcademy.For the launch of The Devil and Miss Prym 4,000 invitations were sent out. The size"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"of the crowd meant that the organizers of the event had to increase the security andsupport services. At the insistence of the author, one thousand plastic glasses of icedmineral water were distributed among those present, and he regretted that he could notdo as he had in France, and serve French champagne.To everyone’s surprise, the Brazilian critics reacted well to The Devil and MissPrym. ‘At the age of fifty-three, Paulo Coelho has produced his most accomplishedwork yet, with a story that arouses the reader’s curiosity and creates genuine tension,’wrote the reviewer in the magazine Época. One of the exceptions was the astrologist BiaAbramo, in the Folha de São Paulo, who was asked by the newspaper to write a review.‘Like his other books, The Devil and Miss Prym seems to be a well-worn parable,’ shewrote, ‘that could have been told in three paragraphs, like the various little anecdotesthat tend to fill his narratives.’Any careful observer of the author at this time would have realized that his energieswere focused not on the critics but on being given a chair in the Brazilian Academy.Paulo had no illusions and he knew, from someone else who had been rejected as acandidate, that ‘it’s easier to be elected as a state governor than to enter the Academy’.It was well known that some of the thirty-nine academicians despised him and his work.‘I tried to read one of his books and couldn’t get beyond page eight,’ the author Rachelde Queiroz, a distant cousin, told newspapers, to which the author replied that none ofhis books even started on page eight. The respected Christian thinker Cândido Mendes,rector and owner of the Universidade Cândido Mendes (where Paulo had almostobtained a degree in law), gave an even harsher evaluation:I have read all his books from cover to cover, from back to front, which comesto the same thing. Paulo Coelho has already had more glory heaped on him inFrance than Santos Dumont. But he’s not really from here: he’s from the globalworld of facile thinking and of ignorance transformed into a kind of sub-magic.Our very pleasant little sorcerer serves this domesticated, toothlessimagination. This subculture disguised as wealth has found its perfect author. Itisn’t a text but a product from a convenience store.Convinced that these views were not shared by the majority of the other thirty-sevenelectors in the Academy, Paulo did not respond to these provocative comments andwent ahead with his plan. He courted the leaders of the several groups and subgroupsinto which the house was divided, lunched and dined with academics, and never missedthe launch of a book by one of the ‘immortals’, as the members of the Academy areknown. At the launch of his novel Saraminda, José Sarney, who was also a favouritetarget of the critics, posed smiling for the photographers as he signed Paulo’s copy,Paulo being the most sought-after by the hundreds of readers queuing to receive a"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"dedication. The fact is that his objective had soon become an open secret. At the end ofthe year, the celebrated novelist Carlos Heitor Cony, who held seat 3 at the Academy,wrote in the Folha do Sul:I wrote an article about the contempt with which the critics treat the singerRoberto Carlos and the writer Paulo Coelho. I think it’s a miracle that the twohave survived, because if they had been dependent on the media, they would beliving under a bridge, begging and cursing the world. That isn’t quite how it is.Each one has a faithful public, they take no notice of the critics, they simplyget on with life, they don’t retaliate and, when they can, they help others. I ama personal friend of Paulo Coelho, and he knows he can count on my vote at theAcademy. I admire his character, his nobility in not attacking anyone and inmaking the most of the success he has achieved with dignity.From the moment the idea of competing for a chair at the Academy entered his head,Coelho had nurtured a secret dream: to occupy chair number 23, whose first occupanthad been Machado de Assis, the greatest of all Brazilian writers and founder of theAcademy. The problem was that the occupant of this chair was the academic whomPaulo most loved, admired and praised, Jorge Amado. This meant that every time thematter came up he had to be careful what he said: ‘Since the chair I want belongs toJorge, I only hope to put myself forward when I am really old,’ he would say, ‘because Iwant him to live for many many more years.’Already eighty-eight, Jorge Amado had suffered a heart attack in 1993 and, in theyears that followed, he was admitted to hospital several times. In June 2001, he wastaken into a hospital in Salvador with infections in the kidneys and right lung, butrecovered sufficiently to be able to celebrate at home with his family the fortiethanniversary of his election to the Academy. However, only three weeks later, on theafternoon of 6 August, the family let it be known that Jorge Amado had just died. Chairnumber 23 was vacant. The news reached Coelho that night via a short phone call fromthe journalist and academic Murilo Melo Filho: ‘Jorge Amado has died. Your time hascome.’Paulo was filled by strange and contradictory feelings: as well as feeling excited atthe thought of standing as a candidate for the Academy, he was genuinely saddened bythe death of someone who had been not only one of his idols but also both a friend andfaithful ally. However, this was no time for sentimentality. Paulo realized that the racefor a chair in the Academy began even before the lilies had withered on the coffin of thedeceased incumbent. His first campaign phone call met with disappointment, though.When he called the professor and journalist Arnaldo Niskier, who occupied chairnumber 18 and was one of the first to have learned, months earlier, of Paulo’s"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"intentions, Niskier poured cold water on the idea. ‘I don’t think it’s the right moment,’Niskier told him. ‘It looks as if Zélia is going to put herself forward, and if that happensthe Academy is sure to vote in her favour.’ Zélia was the writer Zélia Gattai, JorgeAmado’s widow, who had decided to compete for her late husband’s chair.Alongside the many obituaries, the following morning, the newspapers announcedthe names of no fewer than five candidates: Zélia, Paulo, the astronomer RonaldoRogério de Freitas Mourão, the humourist Jô Soares and the journalist Joel Silveira.When taking his daily walk along the promenade above Copacabana beach, Coelhoheard one of the few voices capable of convincing him to do–or not do–something: thatof Chris. With her customary gentleness, she said that she had a bad feeling about thecompetition: ‘Paulo, I don’t think you’re going to win.’This was enough for him to give up the idea. His candidature, which had not evenbeen formally registered, had lasted less than twelve hours. Paulo sent a fax to Zéliaexpressing his sorrow at her husband’s death, packed his bags and left with Chris for thesouth of France. The couple were going to fulfil their old dream of spending part of theyear in Europe, and the place they had chosen was a region near Lourdes. One of thereasons for the trip was to look for a house to buy. While they were still hunting, theiraddress in France was the modest but welcoming Henri IV hotel in the small city ofTarbes.On Tuesday, 9 October, the two were in Odos, a small village 5 kilometres fromSaint-Martin, where some months later they would choose to settle. As though temptedby the Devil whom he had long ago driven away, Coelho had decided to add to hisproperty portfolio something more suited to a rock star than to a man of almostmonastic habits (a millionaire monk, that is): a castle. The castle the couple had theireye on was Château d’Odos, where Marguerite de Valois, or Margot, the wife of HenriIV, had lived and died. However, the whole affair came to nothing –‘If I bought acastle,’ he said to a journalist, ‘I wouldn’t possess it, it would possess me.’ Thatafternoon, he left Chris in the hotel in Tarbes and took a train to Pau, where he boardeda flight to Monte Carlo, where he was to be a member of the film festival jury. In theevening, he was having a coffee with the director Sydney Pollack, when his mobilerang.On the other end he heard the voice of Arnaldo Niskier: ‘Roberto Campos has justdied. May I give the secretary of the Academy the signed letter you left with me puttingyour name forward for the first position available?’‘If you think it’s the right time, yes.’On his return to France a few days later, he stopped off at the chapel of Notre Damede Piétat, in the small town of Barbazan-Débat, and made a silent prayer: ‘Help me getinto the Brazilian Academy of Letters.’A few hours later, in his hotel room in Tarbes, he gave a long interview over thetelephone to the reporter Marcelo Camacho, of the Jornal do Brasil, an interview that"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"began with the obvious question: ‘Is it true that you’re a candidate for the BrazilianAcademy of Letters?’He replied without hesitation: ‘Absolutely.’And the next day’s Jornal do Brasil devoted the front page of its arts section to thescoop. In the interview, Coelho explained the reasons for his candidature (‘a desire to bea colleague of such special people’); dismissed his critics (‘if what I wrote wasn’t anygood my readers would have abandoned me a long time ago, all over the world’); andvehemently condemned George W. Bush’s foreign policy (‘What the United States isdoing in Afghanistan is an act of terror, that’s the only word for it, an act of terror’).The campaign for the vacant chair was official, but Coelho told the journalist that,because of a very full international programme, he would not be back in Brazil foranother two months, in December, when he would carry out the ritual of visits to eachof the thirty-nine electors. This delay was irrelevant, because the election had been setfor March 2002, following the Academy’s end-of-year recess.In the weeks that followed, two other candidates appeared: the political scientistHélio Jaguaribe and the ex-diplomat Mário Gibson Barbosa. Both were octogenariansand each had his strong and weak points. The presence in the competition of one of themost widely read authors in the world attracted the kind of interest that the Academyrarely aroused. The foreign media mobilized their correspondents in Brazil to cover thecontest. In a long, sardonic article published by the New York Times, the correspondentLarry Rother attributed to the Academy the power to ‘transform obscure and agedessayists, poets and philosophers into celebrities who are almost as revered as soccerplayers, actors or pop stars’. Rother included statements from supporters of Coelho suchas Arnaldo Niskier (‘he is the Pelé of Brazilian literature’), and added:Mr Coelho’s public image is not that of a staid academic who enjoys the pompof the Thursday afternoon teas for which the Academy is famous. He began hiscareer as a rock ’n’ roll songwriter, has admitted that he was heavily into drugsat that time, spent brief periods in a mental institution as an adolescent and,perhaps worst of all, refuses to apologize for his overwhelming commercialsuccess. Brazilian society ‘demands excellence in this house’, the novelistNélida Piñon, a former president of the Academy, said in the newspaper OGlobo in what was interpreted as a slap at Mr Coelho’s popularity. ‘We can’tlet the market dictate aesthetics.’Ignoring all the intrigues, Paulo did what he had to do. He wrote letters, visited all theacademicians (with the exception of Padre Fernando Ávila, who told him curtly that thiswould not be necessary) and received much spontaneous support, such as that of CarlosHeitor Cony and ex-president Sarney. On the day of the election, involving four"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"successive ballots, none of the three candidates obtained the minimum nineteen votesrequired under the rules. As tradition directed, the president burned the votes in abronze urn, announced that chair number 21 was still unoccupied and called for furtherelections to be held on 25 July.That evening, some hours after the announcement of the result of the first round, agroup of ‘immortals’ appeared at Paulo’s house to offer the customary condolences.One of them–Coelho cannot remember precisely who–said:It was very good of you to put yourself forward as a candidate, and our shorttime together has been most enjoyable. Perhaps on another occasion you couldtry again.Since he had received a modest ten votes as opposed to the sixteen given toJaguaribe, the group was somewhat taken aback by their host’s immediate reaction:‘I’m not going to wait for another opportunity. I’m going to register my candidaturetomorrow. I’m going to stand again.’It’s likely that the date of the new election was of no significance to the majority ofthe academicians, but Coelho saw in it an unmistakable sign that he should put himselfforward as a candidate: 25 July is the feast day of St James of Compostela, the patronsaint of the pilgrimage that had changed his life. Nevertheless there was no harm inasking for confirmation from the old and, in his opinion, infallible I Ching. He threwthe three coins of the oracle several times, but they always gave the same result: thehexagram of the cauldron, synonymous with certain victory. The I Ching had also madea strange recommendation: ‘Go travelling and don’t come back for a while.’ He did ashe was told.Paulo flew to France, installed himself in the hotel in Tarbes and for the followingthree months conducted his campaign with mobile phone and notebook in hand. Whenhe arrived, he saw on the Internet that he was only going to have one opponent in thecontest: Hélio Jaguaribe. Christina recalls being surprised by Paulo’s self-confidence: ‘Idiscovered that Paulo had negotiating skills about which I knew nothing. His sangfroidin taking decisions and talking to people was a side of him I didn’t know.’Although many of Paulo’s supporters thought it risky to run his campaign from adistance, the I Ching insisted: ‘Do not return.’ The pressure to return to Brazil grewstronger, but he remained immovable. ‘My sixth sense was telling me not to go back,’the writer recalls, ‘and faced by a choice between my sixth sense and the academicians,I chose the former.’ But the campaign began to get serious when one of his supportersstarted canvassing votes during the Thursday afternoon teas using a seductive argument:‘I’m going to vote for Paulo Coelho because the corn is good.’ In the jargon of theAcademy, ‘good corn’ was a metaphor used to refer to candidates who, once elected,"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"could bring both prestige and material benefits to the institution. From that point ofview, the ‘immortal’ argued, the author of The Alchemist was very good corn indeed.There was not only his indisputable international fame, evidenced by the extraordinaryinterest in the election shown by the foreign media: what softened even the mosthardened of hearts was the fact that the millionaire Paulo Coelho had no children,something which fuelled the hope that, on his death, he might choose the Academy asone of his heirs–as other childless academicians had in the past.Unaware that there were people with an eye on the wealth it had cost him sucheffort and energy to accumulate, three weeks before the election, Coelho returned to Riode Janeiro. There, contrary to what the oracles had been telling him, he was not greetedwith good news. His opponent’s campaign had gained ground during his absence andeven some voters whom he had considered to be ‘his’ were threatening to change sides.On the evening of 25 July 2002, the photographers, reporters and cameramencrowding round the door of the building in Avenida Atlântica in Copacabana wereinvited up to the ninth floor to drink a glass of French champagne with the owners ofthe apartment: Paulo had just been elected by twenty-two votes to fifteen. Jaguaribeappeared not to have taken in his defeat, and was not exactly magnanimous whenexpressing his dismay at the result. ‘With the election of Paulo Coelho, the Academy iscelebrating the success of marketing,’ he moaned. ‘His sole merit lies in his ability tosell books.’ To one journalist who wanted to know whether he would be putting hisname forward again, Jaguaribe was adamant: ‘The Academy holds no interest for meany more.’ Three years later, though, once he had got over the shock, he returned andwas elected to the chair left vacant by the economist Celso Furtado. A year after that, itwas the turn of Celso Lafer, the foreign minister, who took the chair left vacant byMiguel Reale.If, in fact, any of the ‘immortals’ really had voted for Paulo Coelho in the hope that‘the corn’ would be good, they would have been bitterly disappointed. In the first place,the international spotlight that followed him around never once lit up the Academy, forthe simple reason that he has attended only six of the more than two hundred sessionsheld in the Academy since his election, which makes him the number one absentee.Those who dreamed that a percentage of his royalties would flow into the Academy’scoffers were also in for a disappointment. In his will, which Paulo has amended threetimes since his election, there is no reference to the Academy.Enjoying a honeymoon period following his victory, and being hailed by an articlein the weekly American Newsweek as ‘the first pop artist of Brazilian literature to enterthe Academy, the house which, for the past 105 years, has been the bastion of thePortuguese language and a fortress of refined taste and intellectual hauteur’, Coelhobegan to write his speech and prepare for his investiture, which was set for 28 October.He decided to go to Brasília in person to give President Fernando Henrique hisinvitation to his inauguration. He was cordially received at Planalto Palace, and was"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"told that the President had appointments in his diary for that day, but would send arepresentative. While waiting for his plane at Brasília airport, he visited the bookshopthere and saw several of his books on display–all of them produced by Editora Roccoand not one by Objetiva. At that moment, he began to consider leaving Objetiva andgoing back to his previous publisher.At the inaugural ceremony, the guests wore black tie while the academicians worethe uniform of the house, an olive-green gold-embroidered cashmere jacket. Tocomplete the outfit, the ‘immortals’ also wore a velvet hat adorned with white feathersand, at their waist, a golden sword. Valued at US$26,250, the uniform used by Paulo hadbeen paid for, as tradition decreed, by the Prefecture of Rio, the city where he was born.Among the hundreds of guests invited to celebrate the new ‘immortal’ were Paulo’sBrazilian publishers, Roberto Feith and Paulo Rocco. The polite remarks theyexchanged gave no hint of the conflict to come. The episode in the bookshop at Brasíliaairport had brought to the surface concerns that had, in fact, been growing for a while.Something similar had occurred some months earlier, when Paulo’s agent Mônica, onholiday with her husband Øyvind in Brazil, decided to extend their trip to Natal, in RioGrande do Norte. Mônica discovered that there were no books by Coelho on saleanywhere in the capital of Rio Grande (which at the time had more than six hundredthousand inhabitants), not even in the bookshop in the city’s international airport.However, the author had far more substantial reasons to be concerned. According tohis calculations, during the period between 1996 and 2000 (when Objetiva launched TheFifth Mountain, Veronika and The Devil and Miss Prym), he had lost no fewer than100,000 readers. The book whose sales he used as a reference point for this conclusionwas not his blockbuster The Alchemist but By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept,which was the last book published by Rocco before his move to Objetiva. What hereally wanted to do was to leave Objetiva immediately and go back to Rocco; there was,however, a problem: the typescript of his next novel, Eleven Minutes, was already in thehands of Objetiva and Roberto Feith had already suggested small changes to which theauthor had agreed.As so often before, though, Paulo let the I Ching have the last word. Four days aftertaking his place in the Academy, he posed two questions: ‘What would happen if Ipublished my next book, Eleven Minutes, with Editora Objetiva?’ and ‘What wouldhappen if I published my next book and my entire backlist with Rocco?’ When the threecoins had been thrown, the answer didn’t appear to be as precise as the questions:‘Preponderance of the small. Perseverance furthers. Small things may be done; greatthings should not be done. The flying bird brings the message: It is not well to striveupward, it is well to remain below. Great good fortune.’ On reading this response, mostpeople would probably have been as confused as ever, but for Paulo Coelho the oraclewas as clear as day: after seven years and four books, the time had come to leaveObjetiva and return to Rocco."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"Annoyed by the news of the change, and particularly by the author’s decision totake with him a book that was ready for printing, Roberto Feith decided that he wouldonly release the typescript of Eleven Minutes if Objetiva were reimbursed for theproduction costs. Paulo saw this as a threat and unsheathed his sword: he took on a largelaw firm in Rio and prepared for a long and painful legal battle. He announced that hewas going back to Rocco–the publisher who, he stated, would launch Eleven Minutesduring the first few months of 2003–and left for Tarbes with Chris, leaving theBrazilian publishing market seething with rumours. Some said that he had left Objetivaout of pique, because Luís Fernando Veríssimo was now their main author. Others saidthat Rocco had offered him US$350,000 to return.Things only began to calm down when Chris, on her daily walk with Paulo, advisedhim to bring an end to the conflict with Feith. ‘It looks as though you want a fight morethan he does! What for? Why?’ she asked. ‘Do what you can to see that it endsamicably.’ After some resistance, Paulo finally gave in. He stopped in front of acrucifix and asked God to remove the hatred from his heart. A few weeks later, aftersome discussion between representatives of the two parties, Feith not only releasedEleven Minutes but also returned to Paulo the four titles in his backlist that Paulowanted to go to Rocco. There was just one point on which the owner of Objetiva dug inhis heels: he refused to allow the insertion of his suggestions in the Rocco edition and inany foreign versions. This obliged Mônica to take back the copies of the text that hadalready been sent to translators in several countries. The problem had been resolved, butCoelho and Feith haven’t spoken to each other since.The book that had caused the uproar had its origins some years earlier, in 1997, inMantua, in the north of Italy, where Coelho had given a lecture. When he arrived at hishotel, he found an envelope that had been left by a Brazilian named Sônia, a reader andfan who had emigrated to Europe in order to work as a prostitute. The packet containedthe typescript of a book in which she told her story. Although he normally never readsuch typescripts, Coelho read it, liked it and suggested it to Objectiva for publication.The publisher, however, wasn’t interested. When Sônia met him again three years laterin Zurich, where she was living at the time, she organized a book signing such asprobably no other writer has ever experienced: she took him to Langstrasse, a streetwhere, after ten at night, the pavement teems with prostitutes from all parts of theworld. Told of Coelho’s presence in the area, dozens of them appeared bearing dog-eared copies of his books in different languages, the majority of which, the authornoted, came from countries that had been part of the former Soviet Union. Since shealso worked in Geneva, Sônia suggested a repetition of this extraordinary event in thered light district there. That was where he met a Brazilian prostitute whom he calledMaria and whose life story was to provide the narrative for Eleven Minutes: the story ofa young girl from northeastern Brazil who is brought to Europe in order, she thinks, tobe a nightclub dancer, but who, on arriving, discovers that she is to be a prostitute. For"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"the author, this was ‘not a book about prostitution or about the misfortunes of aprostitute, but about a person in search of her sexual identity. It is about thecomplicated relationship between feelings and physical pleasure.’The title he chose for the 255-page book is a paraphrase of Seven Minutes, the 1969best-seller in which Irving Wallace describes a court case involving an attempt to ban anovel about sex. Seven minutes, according to Wallace, was the average time taken toperform a sexual act. When Eleven Minutes was published in the United States, areporter from USA Today asked Paulo why he had added four minutes. With a chuckle,he replied that the American’s estimate reflected an Anglo-Saxon point of view and wastherefore ‘too conservative by Latin standards’.Eleven Minutes was launched in Brazil during the first quarter of 2003 and wasreceived by the media with their customary irony–so much so that a month before itslaunch the author predicted the critics’ reaction in an interview given to IstoÉ: ‘How doI know that the critics aren’t going to like it? It’s simple. You can’t loathe an author forten of his books and love him for the eleventh.’ As well as not liking Eleven Minutes,many journalists predicted that it would be the author’s first big flop. According toseveral critics, the risqué theme of the book, which talks of oral sex, clitoral and vaginalorgasms, and sadomasochistic practices, was too explosive a mixture for what theyimagined to be Paulo Coelho’s average reader. Exactly the opposite happened. Beforethe initial print run of 200,000 copies had even arrived in Brazilian bookshops in April2003, Sant Jordi had sold the book to more than twenty foreign publishers afternegotiations that earned the author US$6 million. Three weeks after its launch, ElevenMinutes was top of the best-seller lists in Brazil, Italy and Germany. The launch of theEnglish edition attracted 2,000 people to Borders bookshop in London. As had been thecase with the ten previous books, his readers in Brazil and the rest of the world gaveunequivocal proof that they loved his eleventh book as well. Eleven Minutes went on tobecome Paulo Coelho’s second-most-read book, with 10 million copies sold, losing outonly to the unassailable Alchemist."},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29The ZahirPAULO AND CHRIS spent the first few months of 2004 working on making the old millthey had bought in Saint-Martin habitable. The plan to spend four months there, four inBrazil and four travelling had been scuppered by the suggested programme Mônica hadsent at the beginning of the year. Sant Jordi had been overwhelmed by no fewer than187 invitations for Paulo to present prizes and participate in events, signings,conferences and launches all over the world. If he were to agree to even half of thoserequests there would be no time for anything else–not even his next book, which wasjust beginning to preoccupy him.He had been working on the story in his head during the second half of the year, atthe end of which time just two weeks were enough for him to set down on paper the 318pages of O Zahir, or The Zahir, the title of which had been inspired by a story by JorgeLuís Borges about something which, once touched or seen, would never be forgotten.The nameless main character, who is easily recognizable, is an ex-rock star turnedworld-famous writer, loathed by the critics and adored by his readers. He lives in Pariswith a war correspondent, Esther. The narrative begins with the character’s horror whenhe finds out that she has left him. Written at the end of 2004, in March of the followingyear, the book was ready to be launched in Brazil and several other countries.However, before it was discovered by readers around the world, Braziliansincluded, The Zahir was to be the subject of a somewhat surprising operation: it was tobe published first in, of all places, Tehran, capital of Iran, where Coelho was the mostwidely read foreign author. This was a tactic by the young publisher Arash Hejazi todefeat local piracy which, while not on the same alarming scale as in Egypt, was carriedout with such impunity that twenty-seven different editions of The Alchemist alone hadbeen identified, all of them pirate copies as far as the author was concerned, but none ofthem illegal, because Iran is not a signatory to the international agreements on theprotection of authors’ rights. The total absence of any legislation to suppress theclandestine book industry was due to a peculiarity in the law, which only protects workswhose first edition is printed, published and launched in the country. In order toguarantee his publishing house, Caravan, the right to be the sole publisher of The Zahirin the country, Hejazi suggested that Mônica change the programme of internationallaunches so that the first edition could appear in bookshops in Iran.Some days after the book was published, it faced problems from the government.The bad news was conveyed in a telephone call from Hejazi to the author, who was with"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Mônica in the Hotel Gellert in Budapest. Speaking from a public call box in order tofoil the censors who might be bugging his phone, the terrified thirty-five-year-oldpublisher told Coelho that the Caravan stand at the International Book Fair in Iran hadjust been invaded by a group from the Basejih, the regime’s ‘morality police’. Theofficers had confiscated 1,000 copies of The Zahir, announced that the book was bannedand ordered him to appear two days later at the censor’s office.Both publisher and author were in agreement as to how best to confront suchviolence and ensure Hejazi’s physical safety: they should tell the international public.Coelho made calls to two or three journalist friends, the first he could get hold of, andthe BBC in London and France Presse immediately broadcast the news, which thentravelled around the world. This reaction appears to have frightened off the authorities,because, a few days later, the books were returned without any explanation and the banlifted. It was understandable that a repressive and moralistic state such as Iran shouldhave a problem with a book that deals with adulterous relationships. What wassurprising was that the hand of repression should touch someone as popular in thecountry as Paulo Coelho, who was publicly hailed as ‘the first non-Muslim writer tovisit Iran since the ayatollahs came to power’–that is, since 1979.In fact, Coelho had visited the country in May 2000 as the guest of PresidentMohamed Khatami, who was masterminding a very tentative process of politicalliberalization. When they landed in Tehran, and even though it was three in themorning, Paulo and Chris (who was wearing a wedding ring on her left hand and hadbeen duly informed of the strictures imposed on women in Islamic countries) weregreeted by a crowd of more than a thousand readers who had learned of the arrival ofthe author of The Alchemist from the newspapers. It was just before the new governmentwas about to take office and the political situation was tense. The streets of the capitalwere filled every day with student demonstrations in support of Khatami’s reforms,which were facing strong opposition from the conservative clerics who hold the realpower in the country. Although accompanied everywhere by a dozen or so Brazilian andforeign journalists, Coelho was never far from the watchful eyes of the six securityguards armed with machine guns who had been assigned to him. After giving fivelectures and various book signings for Brida, with an audience of never fewer than athousand, he was honoured by the Minister of Culture, Ataolah Mohajerani, with a galadinner where the place of honour was occupied by no less a person than PresidentKhatami. When the seventy-year-old Iranian novelist Mahmoud Dolatabadi turneddown an invitation to be present at the banquet given in honour of his Braziliancolleague, of whom he was a self-confessed admirer, he referred to the limitations andthe fragility of Khatami’s liberalization process. Hounded by the government, herefused to fraternize with its censors. ‘I cannot be interrogated in the morning,’ he toldthe reporters, ‘and in the evening have coffee with the president.’Some weeks after The Zahir’s publication in Iran, 8 million copies of the book,"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"translated into forty-two languages, arrived in bookshops in eighty-three countries.When it was launched in Europe, the novel came to the attention of the newspapers–notin the political pages, as had been the case with the Iranian censorship, but in the gossipcolumns. In the spring of 2005, a question had been going round the press offices of theEuropean media: who was the inspiration behind the book’s main female character,Esther? The first suspect, put forward by the Moscow tabloid Komsomólskaia Pravda,was the beautiful Russian designer Anna Rossa, who was reported to have had a briefaffair with the author. When he read the news, which was reproduced on an Italianliterary website, Coelho was quick to send the newspaper a letter, which his friend thejournalist Dmitry Voskoboynikov translated:Dear readers of Komsomólskaia PravdaI was most intrigued to learn from your newspaper that I had an affair withthe designer Anna Rossa three years ago and that this woman is supposedly themain character in my new book, The Zahir. Happily or unhappily, we shallnever know which, the information is simply not true.When I was shown a photo of this young woman at my side, I rememberedher at once. In fact, we were introduced at a reception at the Brazilian embassy.Now I am no saint, but there was not and probably never will be anythingbetween the two of us.The Zahir is perhaps one of my deepest books, and I have dedicated it tomy partner Christina Oiticica, with whom I have lived for twenty-five years. Iwish you and Anna Rossa love and success.YoursPaulo CoelhoIn the face of this quick denial, the journalists’ eyes turned to another beautiful woman,the Chilean Cecília Bolocco, Miss Universe 1987, who, at the time, was presenting LaNoche de Cecília, a highly successful chat show in Chile. On her way to Madrid, whereshe was recording interviews for her programme, she burst out laughing when shelearned that she was being named as the inspiration for Esther in The Zahir: ‘Don’t saythat! Carlito gets very jealous...’ The jealous ‘Carlito’ was the former Argentinepresident, Carlos Menem, whom she had married in May 2000, when he was seventyand she was thirty-five. Cecília’s reaction was understandable. Some years earlier, thepress had informed readers that she had had an affair with Coelho between thebeginning of 1999 and October 2000, when she was married to Menem. Both hadvehemently denied the allegations. Suspicions also fell on the Italian actress ValeriaGolino.However, on 17 April 2005, a Sunday, the Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manhã"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"announced on its front page that the woman on whom Paulo had based the character wasthe English journalist Christina Lamb, war correspondent for the Sunday Times. Whenshe was phoned up in Harare, where she was doing an interview, she couldn’t believethat the secret had been made public. She was the ‘real-life Esther’, the newspaperconfirmed. ‘All last week I fielded phone calls from newspapers in Spain, Portugal,Brazil, South Africa, even Britain, asking how I felt being “Paulo Coelho’s muse”,’ shesaid in a full-page article in the Sunday Times Review, entitled ‘He stole my soul’ andwith a curious subtitle: ‘Christina Lamb has covered many foreign wars for the SundayTimes, but she had no defences when one of the world’s bestselling novelists decided tohijack her life.’In the article, the journalist says that she met Coelho two years earlier when shewas chosen to interview him about the success of Eleven Minutes. At the time, thewriter was still living in the Henri IV hotel. This was their only meeting. During thefollowing months, they exchanged e-mails, he in the south of France and she inKandahar and Kabul, in Afghanistan. Coelho so enjoyed Christina’s The Sewing Circlesof Herat that he included it in his ‘Top Ten Reads’ on the Barnes & Noble website.When she checked her e-mails in June 2004 she found, ‘among the usual monotonousupdates from the coalition forces in Kabul and junk offering penis enlargement’, amessage from Coelho with a huge attachment. It was the Portuguese typescript of hisjust completed book The Zahir, with a message saying: ‘The female character wasinspired by you.’ He then explained that he had thought of trying to meet, but she wasalways away, so he had used her book and Internet research to create the character. Inthe article published in the Sunday Times, she describes what she felt as she read the e-mail:I was part astonished, part flattered, part alarmed. He didn’t know me. Howcould he have based a character on me? I felt almost naked. Like most people, Iguess, there were things in my life I would not wish to see in print. [...]So with some trepidation I downloaded the 304-page file and opened it. AsI read the manuscript I recognized things I had told him in Tarbes, insights intomy private world, as well as concerns I had discussed in my book.The first paragraph began: ‘Her name is Esther, she is a war correspondentwho has just returned from Iraq because of the imminent invasion of thatcountry; she is thirty years old, married, without children.’At least he had made me younger.What had at first seemed amusing (‘I was starting to enjoy the idea that the heroine wasbased on me, and now here she was disappearing on page one,’ Christina wrote) wasbecoming uncomfortable as she read on:"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"I was slightly concerned about his description of how Esther and her husbandhad met. ‘One day, a journalist comes to interview me. She wants to know whatit’s like to have my work known all over the country but to be entirelyunknown myself...She’s pretty, intelligent, quiet. We meet again at a party,where there’s no pressure of work, and I manage to get her into bed that samenight.’Astonished by what she had read, Christina told her mother and her husband–aPortuguese lawyer named Paulo:Far from sharing my feeling of flattery, he was highly suspicious about whyanother man should be writing a book on his wife. I told a few friends and theylooked at me as though I was mad. I decided it was better not to mention it toanyone else.If the Correio da Manhã had not revealed the secret, the matter would have ended there.The revelation would not, after all, have caused any further discomfort for thejournalist, as she herself confessed in her article:Once I got used to it, I decided I quite liked being a muse. But I was not quitesure what muses do. [...] I asked Coelho how a muse should behave. ‘Musesmust be treated like fairies,’ he replied, adding that he had never had a musebefore. I thought being a muse probably involved lying on a couch with a largebox of fancy chocolates, looking pensive. [...] But being a muse is not easy ifyou work full time and have a five-year-old. [...] In the meantime, I have learntthat going to interview celebrity authors can be more hazardous than coveringwars. They might not shoot you but they can steal your soul.The book seemed destined to cause controversy. Accustomed to the media’s hostilitytowards Coelho’s previous books, Brazilian readers had a surprise during the final weekof March 2005. On all the news-stands in the country three of the four major weeklymagazines had photos of Coelho on the cover and inside each were eight pages aboutthe author and his life. This unusual situation led the journalist Marcelo Beraba, theombudsman of the Folha de São Paulo, to dedicate the whole of his Sunday column tothe subject.The ‘case of the three covers’, as it became known, was deemed important onlybecause it revealed a radical change in behaviour in a media which, with a few rareexceptions, had treated the author very badly. It was as though Brazil had just"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"discovered a phenomenon that so many countries had been celebrating since theworldwide success of The Alchemist.Whatever the critics might say, what distinguished Paulo from other best-sellers,such as John Grisham and Dan Brown, was the content of his books. Some of thoseauthors might even sell more books, but they don’t fill auditoriums around the world, asPaulo does. The impact his work has on his readers can be measured by the hundreds ofe-mails that he receives daily from all corners of the earth, many of them from peopletelling him how reading his books has changed their lives. Ordinary letters posted fromthe most remote places, sometimes simply addressed to ‘Paulo Coelho–Brazil’, arriveby the sackload.In February 2006–as if in acknowledgement of his popularity–Coelho received aninvitation from Buckingham Palace–from Sir James Hamilton, Duke of Abercorn andLord Steward of the Household. This was for a state banquet to be given some weekslater for the President of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, by Queen Elizabeth II andPrince Philip during the President’s official visit to Britain. The invitation made clearthat the occasion called for ‘white tie with decorations’. As the date of the banquetapproached, however, newspapers reported that, at the request of the Braziliangovernment, both President Lula and his seventy-strong delegation had been relieved ofthe obligation to wear tails. When he read this, Coelho (who had dusted off his tails,waistcoat and white tie) was confused as to what to do. Concerned that he might make ablunder, he decided to send a short e-mail to the Royal Household asking forinstructions: ‘I just read that President Lula vetoed the white tie for the BrazilianDelegation. Please let me know how to proceed–I don’t want to be the only one with awhite tie.’The reply, signed by a member of the Royal Household, arrived two days later, alsoby e-mail:Mr. Coelho:Her Majesty The Queen Elizabeth II has agreed that President Lula andmembers of his official suite need not wear white tie to the State Banquet.However, that will be just a small number of people (less than 20). Theremainder of the 170 guests will be in white tie, so I can reassure you that youwill not be the only person wearing white tie. The Queen does expect her gueststo wear white tie and you are officially a guest of Her Majesty The Queen, notPresident Lula."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30One hundred million copies soldSOME WEEKS AFTER HANDING HIS PUBLISHERS the typescript of The Witch of Portobello,which he had finished a week prior to the banquet at Buckingham Palace, Coelho waspreparing for a new test. Two decades had passed since 1986, when he had followed theRoad to Santiago, the first and most important of the penances imposed by Jean. In theyears that followed, the mysterious Master had, in agreement with Coelho, regularlyordered further trials. At least one of these the author has confessed to having fulfilledpurely out of respect for the duty to find disciples to whom he should transmit theknowledge he had received from Jean and show them the route to spiritualenlightenment. ‘I have disciples because I am obliged to, but I don’t enjoy it,’ he toldjournalists. ‘I’m very lazy and have little patience.’ In spite of this resistance, he hasacted as guide to four new initiates as demanded by RAM.Besides following the Routes, the name given by members of the order to thedifferent pilgrimages, he was ordered by Jean to submit to various tests. Some of thesedid not require much willpower or physical strength, such as praying at least once a daywith his hands held beneath a jet of flowing water, which could be from a tap or astream. Coelho does, however, admit to having been given tasks that were not at all easyto perform, such as submitting to a vow of chastity for six months, during which timeeven masturbation was forbidden. In spite of this deprivation, he speaks with goodhumour about the experience, which happened in the late 1980s. ‘I discovered thatsexual abstinence is accompanied by a great deal of temptation,’ he recalls. ‘Thepenitent has the impression that every woman desires him, or, rather, that only thereally pretty ones do.’ Some of these tests were akin to rituals of self-flagellation. Forthree months, for example, he was obliged to walk for an hour a day, barefoot andwithout a shirt, through brushwood in thick scrubland until his chest and arms werescratched by thorns and the soles of his feet lacerated by stones. Compared with that,tasks such as fasting for three days or having to look at a tree for five minutes every dayfor months on end were as nothing.The task Jean set his disciple in April 2006 may seem to a layman totallynonsensical. The time had come for him to take the External Road to Jerusalem, whichmeant spending four months (or, as the initiates prefer to say, ‘three months plus one’)wandering about the world, wherever he chose, without setting foot in either of his twohomes–the house in France and his apartment in Rio de Janeiro. For him this meantspending all that time in hotels. Did this mean that only those with enough money to"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"pay for such an extravagance could join the order? Coelho had been troubled by thisvery question twenty years earlier, just before setting off along the Road to Santiago,and he recalls Jean’s encouraging reply: ‘Travelling isn’t always a question of money,but of courage. You spent a large part of your life travelling the world as a hippie. Whatmoney did you have then? None. Hardly enough to pay for your fare, and yet thosewere, I believe, some of the best years of your life–eating badly, sleeping in railwaystations, unable to communicate because of the language, being forced to depend onothers even for finding somewhere to spend the night.’If the new Road to Jerusalem was unavoidable, the solution was to relax and put thetime to good use. He devoted the first few weeks to carrying out a small number of theengagements that had accumulated in Sant Jordi’s diary, among which was the LondonBook Fair. While there, he chanced to meet Yuri Smirnoff, the owner of Sophia, hispublisher in Russia. Coelho told him that he was in the middle of a strange pilgrimageand that this might be the perfect opportunity to realize an old dream: to take thelegendary Trans-Siberian Railway which crosses 9,289 kilometres and traverses 75 percent of Russia, from Moscow to Vladivostok. Some weeks later, he received a phonecall while he was touring in Catalonia, in northern Spain. It was Smirnoff calling to saythat he had decided to make Coelho’s dream come true and was offering him a fortnighton one of the longest railway journeys in the world.Coelho assumed that the gift would be a compartment on the train. Much to hissurprise, when he arrived in Moscow on 15 May, the agreed date for his departure, hediscovered that Smirnoff had decided to turn the trip into a luxurious ‘happening’. Hehad hired two entire coaches. Paulo would travel in a suite in the first, and the other twocompartments would be occupied by Smirnoff, his wife and Eva, an admirer ofCoelho’s work, who would act as his interpreter during the two-week journey. He wasalso provided with a chef, two cooks and a waiter, as well as two bodyguards from theRussian government to ensure their guest’s safety. The second coach was to be givenover to thirty journalists from Russia and other European countries, who had beeninvited to accompany the author. Altogether, this kind gesture cost Smirnoff aboutUS$200,000, and it proved to be a very poor investment indeed: some months laterCoelho left Sophia for another publisher, Astrel.It turned out to be an exhausting fortnight, not just because of the distance covered,but because he was constantly besieged by his readers. At every stop, the platformswere filled by hundreds and hundreds of readers wanting an autograph, a handshake, oreven just a word. After crossing the provinces in the far east of Russia and skirting thefrontiers of Mongolia and China, on a journey that crossed eight time zones, the groupfinally arrived in Vladivostok on the edge of the Sea of Japan on 30 May.During the interviews he gave while on his Trans-Siberian journey Coelho made itclear that, in spite of the comfort in which he was travelling, it was not a tourist trip.‘This is not just a train journey,’ he insisted several times, ‘but a spiritual journey"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"through space and time in order to complete a pilgrimage ordered by my Master.’Despite all these years of being a constant presence in newspapers and magazines acrossthe world, no journalist has ever been able to discover the true identity of themysterious character to whom Paulo owes so much. Some months after the end of theWorld Cup in 2006, someone calling himself simply a ‘reader of Paulo Coelho’ sent aphoto to the website set up for collecting information for this book. It showed Coelhowearing a Brazilian flag draped over his shoulders, Christina and a third person walkingdown a street. The third person was a thin man, with grey hair, wearing faded jeans, aBrazilian football shirt and a mobile phone hanging around his neck. It was hard toidentify him because he was wearing a cap and sunglasses and his right hand was partlycovering his face. The photograph bore a short caption written by the anonymouscontributor: ‘This photo was taken by me in Berlin during the 2006 World Cup. Theman in the cap is Jean, Paulo Coelho’s Master in RAM.’ When he saw the photo, theauthor was deliberately vague: ‘What can I say?’ he said. ‘If it isn’t him, it’s very likehim.’Two months after the end of the World Cup, Brazilian bookshops were receivingthe first 100,000 copies of The Witch of Portobello. It was a book full of new ideas. Thefirst of these, to be found right at the beginning, is the method used by the author torelate the travails of Athena, the book’s protagonist. The story of the young Gypsy girlborn in Transylvania, in Romania, and abandoned by her biological mother is narratedby fifteen different characters. This device brought eloquent praise for his work in theFolha de São Paulo. ‘One cannot deny that, in literary terms, this is one of PauloCoelho’s most ambitious novels,’ wrote Marcelo Pen. The book is the story of Athena’slife. Adopted by a Lebanese couple and taken to Beirut, from where the family is drivenout by the civil war that raged in Lebanon from 1975 until 1990, she then settles inLondon. She grows up in Britain, where she is educated, marries and has a son. Sheworks for a bank before leaving her husband and going to Romania in order to find herbiological mother. She then moves to the Persian Gulf, where she becomes a successfulestate agent in Dubai. On her return to London, she develops and seeks to deepen herspirituality, becoming, in the end, a priestess, who attracts hundreds of followers. As aresult of this, however, she becomes a victim of religious intolerance.The second innovation was technological. The book appeared on the author’swebsite before the printed version reached the Brazilian and Portuguese bookshops, andin just two days his web page received 29,000 hits, which took everyone, including theauthor, by surprise. ‘It was just amazing, but it proved that the Internet has become anobligatory space for a writer to share his work with the readers,’ he told newspapers. Tothose who feared that the initiative might rob bookshops of readers, he replied: ‘In1999, I discovered that the edition of The Alchemist published in Russia was availableon the Internet. Then I decided to confront piracy on its own ground and I startedputting my books on the web first. Instead of falling, sales in bookshops increased.’"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"As though wanting to reaffirm that these were not empty words, the site where hebegan to make his books available (www.piratecoelho.wordpress.com) has a photo ofthe author with a bandana on his head and a black eye patch, as though he were a realpirate. Convinced that someone only reads books on-screen if he has no other option,and that printing them out at home would cost more than buying them in the bookshops,Coelho began to make all his books available online. ‘It has been proved that if peopleread the first chapters on the Internet and like it,’ he states, ‘they will go out and buy thebook.’Since the middle of 2006, he and Mônica and Chris, as well as some of hispublishers, had been hoping that the number of books sold would pass the 100-millionmark around the feast day of St Joseph, 19 March, the following year, when he haddecided he would celebrate his sixtieth birthday. As it turned out, the 100-millionthbook was not sold until five months later, in August, which was his real birthday.Although he had told the newspapers that being sixty was no more important than beingthirty-five or forty-seven, in February, he decided that he would celebrate St Joseph’sday in the Hotel El Peregrino, in Puente la Reina, a small Spanish town 20 kilometresfrom Pamplona, halfway along the Road to Santiago. That day he announced on his blogthat he would be glad to welcome the first ten readers to reply in Puente la Reina. Whenthe messages began to arrive–coming from places as far away as Brazil, Japan, England,Venezuela and Qatar–Paulo feared that those who replied might think that the invitationincluded air trips and accommodation, and hastened to clarify the situation. To hissurprise, they had all understood what he meant and were prepared to bear the cost. Onthe actual day, there were five Spaniards (Luís Miguel, Clara, Rosa, Loli and Ramón), aGreek (Chrissa), an Englishman (Alex), a Venezuelan (Marian), a Japanese (Heiko) andan American who lived in northern Iraq (Nika), as well as the ex-football star Raí andPaulo’s old friends, among them Nelson Liano, Jr, his partner on the Manual doVampirismo, and Dana Goodyear, the American journalist. In his blog, Liano summedup the atmosphere at El Peregrino:It was a celebration in honour of St Joseph in four languages. Paulo adopted thefeast day of the patron saint of workers to celebrate his birthday, following anold Spanish Christian tradition. While the party was going on, a snowfall leftthe Road to Santiago completely white. Salsa, French regional music, thebolero, tango, samba and the unforgettable hits that Paulo had written withRaul Seixas gave a pan-musical note to the party, accompanied by the very bestRioja wine.Five months later, as his real birthday was approaching, the team led by Mônica at SantJordi was working flat out on the preparation of a smart forty-page folder in English,"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"the cover of which bore a photo of a beaming Paulo Coelho and the words ‘PAULOCOELHO–100,000,000 COPIES’.

Anyone strolling along thenarrow, sunny little streets in Barbazan-Debat, 10 kilometres from Saint-Martin, atthree o’clock that afternoon, might not even have noticed the presence of the man withclose-cropped white hair, wearing trainers, T-shirt and bermudas. Coelho had just comeout of the small chapel of Notre Dame de Piétat and sat down on a wooden bench, wherehe placed a notebook on his lap and began to write. The few tourists who drove pastwould have found it hard to associate that slight, rather monk-like figure with the authorcourted by kings, emirs and Hollywood stars and acclaimed by readers all over theworld. Christina, who was watching from a distance, went over to him and asked whathe was writing.‘A letter,’ he replied, without looking up.‘Who to?’ she went on.‘To the author of my biography.’Posted some hours later at Saint-Martin post office, the letter is reproduced in itsentirety below.Barbazan-Debat, 24 August 2007Dear FernandoI’m sitting here outside this small chapel and have just repeated the usualritual: lighting three candles to Notre Dame de Piétat.

I wrote them to discoverwhat, given your training as a journalist and given your Marxist convictions,will not be in your book: my secret corners, sometimes dark and sometimeslight, which I only began to be aware of when I set them down on paper.Like any writer, I always flirted with the idea of an autobiography, but it’simpossible to write about yourself without ending up justifying your mistakesand magnifying your successes–it’s human nature.

While you were interviewing me and I was forced to lookagain at certain periods of my life, I kept thinking: What would have become ofme if I hadn’t experienced those things?It’s not worth going into that now: Chris says we should go back home, wehave another two hours to walk, the sun’s getting stronger and the ground isdry. I have asked her for another five minutes to finish this. Who shall I be inyour biography? Although I haven’t read it, I know the reply: I shall be thecharacters who crossed my path. I shall be the person who held out his hand,trusting that there would be another hand waiting to support me in difficulttimes.I exist because I have friends. I have survived because they were there onmy path. They taught me to give the best of myself, even when, at some stagesin my life, I was not a good pupil. But I think that I have learned somethingabout generosity.Chris says that my five minutes are up, but I’ve asked for a little more timeso that I can write here, in this letter, the words that Khalil Gibran wrote morethan a hundred years ago. They’re probably not in the right order, because Ilearned them by heart on a distant, sad and gloomy night when I was listeningto Simon & Garfunkel on that machine we used to call a ‘gramophone’, whichhas now been superseded (just as, one day, the Airbus 380 will and, eventually,my books). They are words that speak about the importance of giving:‘It is only when you give of yourself that you truly give. Therefore givenow, that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors.‘People often say: “I would give, but only to the deserving.” The trees inyour orchard say not so. They give that they may live, for to withhold is toperish.‘Therefore, when you share something out, do not think of yourselves asgenerous people. The truth is, it is life that divides things up and shares themout, and we human beings are mere witnesses to our own existence.’I’m going to get up now and go home. A witness to my own existence, thatis what I have been every day of the sixty years I am celebrating today.May Our Lady of Piétat bless you.PauloWhen this biography was completed, in February 2008, the A380 was in commercialoperation.

As a journalist, I was usedto accompanying international names and stars and imagined I would find himsurrounded by bodyguards, secretaries and assistants. To my surprise, the man withwhom I would spend much of the following three years turned up alone, with a rucksackon his back and dragging a small suitcase on wheels. It was there that the excavationbegan that would reveal one of the most extraordinary individuals I have ever workedwith.After six weeks at his side, I returned to Brazil. Since the entire course of his lifehas revolved around Rio, I moved there and spent eight months following the trails leftby the writer. I looked for Paulo Coelho everywhere and probed behind the events thathad left so many scars. I searched for him in the dark alleys of the roughest areas ofCopacabana, among the records of the insane and the ruins of what had once been DrEiras’s clinic, in the dangerous world of drugs, in files dating from the years of politicalrepression in Brazil, in satanism, in mysterious secret societies, in his partnership withRaul Seixas, in his family and his genealogy. I talked to friends and those who hadfallen out with him, interviewed many of his ex-lovers and spent some time with hispresent–and, he vows, his last–partner, the artist Christina Oiticica. I rummaged throughhis life, dug deep into his private affairs, read his will, studied his medications, read hisbank statements, felt in his pockets and searched for the children I imagined must haveresulted from his various relationships and love affairs.I won a bet with him that gave me access to a treasure that he had decided was to beburnt after his death: a trunk that held forty years of diaries, many of them recorded oncassette tapes. I spent weeks closeted in the Paulo Coelho Institute scanning documents,photos, old diaries and letters both received and sent. Once my time in Rio was over, Iagain accompanied him on trips to various corners of the earth with a recorder slungover my shoulder, listening to his nasal voice and to his comments, and watching thatstrange tic he has of flicking away non-existent flies from his eyes. I went with him onthe road to Santiago de Compostela, I saw how moved he was on meeting a group ofordinary readers in Oñati, in the Spanish Basque country and in Cairo, and I watchedhim being acclaimed by men in black ties and women in long dresses at banquets heldin his honour in Paris and Hamburg.I put together the pieces left behind by Paulo Coelho throughout his sixty years, andthe result is this book. Although the responsibility for everything written here is mine"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"alone, I must acknowledge the help of the dozens of people who helped me along theway. Firstly, my old friend Wagner Homem. I asked him to apply his expertise toorganizing the vast quantity of data, interviews and documents that I accumulatedduring three years of research.
