The ontology, rational psychology, cosmology, yes even naturaltheology, of former times−where is now to be heard any mention of them, or who would venture to mentionthem? Inquiries, for instance, into the immateriality of the soul, into efficient and final causes, where shouldthese still arouse any interest? Even the former proofs of the existence of God are cited only for theirhistorical interest or for purposes of edification and uplifting the emotions. The fact is that there no longerexists any interest either in the form or the content of metaphysics or in both together. If it is remarkablewhen a nation has become indifferent to its constitutional theory, to its national sentiments, its ethicalcustoms and virtues, it is certainly no less remarkable when a nation loses its metaphysics, when the spiritwhich contemplates its own pure essence is no longer a present reality in the life of the nation. § 3 The exoteric teaching of the Kantian philosophy −− that the understanding ought not to go beyondexperience, else the cognitive faculty will become a theoretical reason which itself generates nothing butfantasies of the brain −− this was a justification from a philosophical quarter for the renunciation ofspeculative thought. In support of this popular teaching came the cry of modern educationists that the needsof the time demanded attention to immediate requirements, that just as experience was the primary factor forknowledge, so for skill in public and private life, practice and practical training generally were essential andalone necessary, theoretical insight being harmful even. Philosophy [Wissenschaft] and ordinary commonsense thus co−operating to bring about the downfall of metaphysics, there was seen the strange spectacle of acultured nation without metaphysics−like a temple richly ornamented in other respects but without a holy ofholies. Theology, which in former times was the guardian of the speculative mysteries and of metaphysics(although this was subordinate to it) had given up this science in exchange for feelings, for what waspopularly matter−of−fact, and for historical erudition. In keeping with this change, there vanished from theworld those solitary souls who were sacrificed by their people and exiled from the world to the end that theeternal should be contemplated and served by lives devoted solely thereto −− not for any practical gain butfor the sake of blessedness; a disappearance which, in another context, can be regarded as essentially thesame phenomenon as that previously mentioned. So that having got rid of the dark utterances of metaphysics,of the colourless communion of the spirit with itself, outer existence seemed to be transformed into the brightworld of flowers−and there are no black flowers, as we know. Science of LogicPreface to the First Edition2"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"§ 4 Logic did not fare quite so badly as metaphysics. That one learns from logic how to think (the usefulness oflogic and hence its purpose, were held to consist in this −− just as if one could only learn how to digest andmove about by studying anatomy and physiology) this prejudice has long since vanished, and the spirit ofpracticality certainly did not intend for logic a better fate than was suffered by the sister science. § 5 Nevertheless, probably for the sake of a certain formal utility, it was still left a place among the sciences, andindeed was even retained as a subject of public instruction. However, this better lot concerns only the outerfate of logic, for its structure and contents have remained the same throughout a long inherited tradition,although in the course of being passed on the contents have become ever more diluted and attenuated; logicshows no traces so far of the new spirit which has arisen in the sciences no less than in the world of actuality.However, once the substantial form of the spirit has inwardly reconstituted itself, all attempts to preserve theforms of an earlier culture are utterly in vain; like withered leaves they are pushed off by the new budsalready growing at their roots. § 6 Even in the philosophical sphere this ignoring of the general change is beginning gradually to come to an end.Imperceptibly, even those who are opposed to the new ideas have become familiar with them and haveappropriated them, and if they continue to speak slightingly of the source and principles of those ideas and todispute them, still they have accepted their consequences and have been unable to defend themselves fromtheir influence; the only way in which they can give a positive significance and a content to their negativeattitude which is becoming less and less important, is to fall in with the new ways of thinking. § 7 On the other hand, it seems that the period of fermentation with which a new creative idea begins is past. Inits first manifestation, such an idea usually displays a fanatical hostility toward the entrenchedsystematisation of the older principle; usually too, it is fearful of losing itself in the ramifications of theparticular and again it shuns the labour required for a scientific elaboration of the new principle and in itsneed for such, it grasps to begin with at an empty formalism. The challenge to elaborate and systematise thematerial now becomes all the more pressing. There is a period in the culture of an epoch as in the culture ofthe individual, when the primary concern is the acquisition and assertion of the principle in its undevelopedintensity. But the higher demand is that it should become systematised knowledge. § 8 Now whatever may have been accomplished for the form and content of philosophy in other directions, thescience of logic which constitutes metaphysics proper or purely speculative philosophy, has hitherto still beenmuch neglected. What it is exactly that I understand by this science and its standpoint, I have statedprovisionally in the Introduction. The fact that it has been necessary to make a completely fresh start with this science, the very nature of thesubject matter and the absence of any previous works which might have been utilised for the projectedreconstruction of logic, may be taken into account by fair−minded critics, even though a labour coveringmany years has been unable to give this effort a greater perfection. The essential point of view is that what isinvolved is an altogether new concept of scientific procedure. Science of LogicPreface to the First Edition3"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Philosophy, if it would be a science, cannot, as I have remarked elsewhere, borrow its method from asubordinate science like mathematics, any more than it can remain satisfied with categorical assurances ofinner intuition, or employ arguments based on grounds adduced by external reflection. On the contrary, it canbe only the nature of the content itself which spontaneously develops itself in a scientific method of knowing,since it is at the same time the reflection of the content itself which first posits and generates its determinatecharacter. § 9 The understanding determines, and holds the determinations fixed; reason is negative and dialectical, becauseit resolves the determinations of the understanding into nothing; it is positive because it generates theuniversal and comprehends the particular therein. Just as the understanding is usually taken to be something separate from reason as such, so too dialecticalreason is usually taken to be something distinct from positive reason. But reason in its truth is spirit which ishigher than either merely positive reason, or merely intuitive understanding. It is the negative, that which constitutes the quality alike of dialectical reason and of understanding; it negateswhat is simple, thus positing the specific difference of the understanding; it equally resolves it and is thusdialectical. But it does not stay in the nothing of this result but in the result is no less positive, and in this way it hasrestored what was at first simple, but as a universal which is within itself concrete; a given particular is notsubsumed under this universal but in this determining, this positing of a difference, and the resolving of it, theparticular has at the same time already determined itself. This spiritual movement which, in its simpleundifferentiatedness, gives itself its own determinateness and in its determinateness its equality with itself,which therefore is the immanent development of the Notion, this movement is the absolute method ofknowing and at the same time is the immanent. soul of the content itself. I maintain that it is this self−construing method alone which enables philosophy to be an objective,demonstrated science. § 10 It is in this way that I have tried to expound consciousness in the Phenomenology of Spirit. Consciousness isspirit as a concrete knowing, a knowing too, in which externality is involved; but the development of thisobject, like the development of all natural and spiritual life, rests solely on the nature of the pure essentialitieswhich constitute the content of logic. Consciousness, as spirit in its manifestation which in its progress frees itself from its immediacy and externalconcretion, attains to the pure knowing which takes as its object those same pure essentialities as they are inand for themselves. They are pure thoughts, spirit thinking its own essential nature. Their self−movement istheir spiritual life and is that through which philosophy constitutes itself and of which it is the exposition. § 11 In the foregoing there is indicated the relation of the science which I call the Phenomenology of Spirit, tologic. As regards the external relation, it was intended that the first part of the System of Science whichcontains the Phenomenology should be followed by a second part containing logic and the two concrete[realen] sciences, the Philosophy of Nature and the Philosophy of Spirit, which would complete the Systemof Philosophy. But the necessary expansion which logic itself has demanded has induced me to have this part Science of LogicPreface to the First Edition4"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"published separately; it thus forms the first sequel to the Phenomenology of Spirit in an expandedarrangement of the system. It will later be followed by an exposition of the two concrete philosophicalsciences mentioned. This first volume of the Logic contains as Book One the Doctrine of Being; Book Two,the Doctrine of Essence, which forms the second part of the first volume, is already in the press; the secondvolume will contain Subjective Logic or the Doctrine of the Notion. Nuremberg, March 22, 1812. Preface to the Second Edition§ 12 When I undertook this fresh elaboration of the Science of Logic of which this is the first volume, I was fullyconscious −− not only of the inherent difficulty of the subject matter and of its exposition, but also of theimperfection of its treatment in the first edition; earnestly as I have tried after many years of furtheroccupation with this science to remedy this imperfection, I feel I still have reason enough to claim theindulgence of the reader. One title to such claim in the first instance may well be based on the fact that in themain there was available for the contents of the science only external material in the older metaphysics andlogic. Though these two sciences have been universally and abundantly cultivated, the latter even up to ourown day, the interest taken in the speculative side has been only slight; in fact, on the whole, the samematerial has been just repeated over and over again, sometimes being thinned out to the point of being trivialand superficial and sometimes more of the old ballast has been hauled out afresh and trailed along with logic.From such efforts, often purely mechanical, the philosophical import of the science could gain nothing. § 13 To exhibit the realm of thought philosophically, that is, in its own immanent activity or what is the same, inits necessary development, had therefore to be a fresh undertaking, one that had to be started right from thebeginning; but this traditional material, the familiar forms of thought, must be regarded as an extremelyimportant source, indeed as a necessary condition and as a presupposition to be gratefully acknowledged eventhough what it offers is only here and there a meagre shred or a disordered heap of dead bones . § 14 The forms of thought are, in the first instance, displayed and stored as human language. Nowadays we cannotbe too often reminded that it is thinking which distinguishes man from the beasts. Into all that becomessomething inward for men, an image or conception as such, into all that he makes his own, language haspenetrated, and everything that he has transformed into language and expresses in it contains acategory−concealed, mixed with other forms or clearly determined as such, so much is Logic his naturalelement, indeed his own peculiar nature. If nature as such, as the physical world, is contrasted with thespiritual sphere, then logic must certainly be said to be the supernatural element which permeates everyrelationship of man to nature, his sensation, intuition, desire, need, instinct, and simply by so doingtransforms it into something human, even though only formally human, into ideas and purposes. It is anadvantage when a language possesses an abundance of logical expressions, that is, specific and separateexpressions for the thought determinations themselves; many prepositions and articles denote relationshipsbased on thought; the Chinese language is supposed not to have developed to this stage or only to aninadequate extent. These particles, however, play quite a subordinate part having only a slightly moreindependent form than the prefixes and suffixes, inflections and the like. It is much more important that in alanguage the categories should appear in the form of substantives and verbs and thus be stamped with theform of objectivity. In this respect German has many advantages over other modern languages; some of its Science of LogicPreface to the Second Edition5"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"words even possess the further peculiarity of having not only different but opposite meanings so that onecannot fail to recognise a speculative spirit of the language in them: it can delight a thinker to come acrosssuch words and to find the union of opposites naively shown in the dictionary as one word with oppositemeanings, although this result of speculative thinking is nonsensical to the understanding. Philosophytherefore stands in no need of a special terminology; true, some words have to be taken from foreignlanguages but these have already acquired through usage the right of citizenship in the philosophicalrealm−and an affected purism would be most inappropriate where it was the distinctive meaning which wasof decisive importance. The advance of culture generally, and of the sciences in particular, gradually bringsinto use higher relationships of thought, or at least raises them to greater universality and they have thusattracted increased attention. This applies even to the empirical and natural sciences which in general employthe commonest categories, for example, whole and parts, a thing and its properties, and the like. § 15 In physics, for example, the category of force has become predominant, but more recently the category ofpolarity which is the determination of a difference in which the different terms are inseparably conjoined, hasplayed the leading part although it has been used inordinately in connection with all phenomena, even withlight. It is a matter of infinite importance that in this way an advance has been made beyond the form ofabstraction, of identity, by which a specific concept, as, for example, force, acquires an independentself−subsistence, and that prominence and currency have been given to the determinate form, the difference,which is at the same time an inseparable element in the identity. Because of the fixed reality of naturalobjects the study of nature compels us to fix the categories which can no longer be ignored in her, althoughwith complete inconsistency towards other categories which are also allowed to remain valid; and such studydoes not permit the further step of abstracting from the opposition and indulging in generalities as so easilyhappens in the intellectual sphere. § 16 But while logical objects and their expressions may be thoroughly familiar to educated people it does notfollow, as I have said elsewhere, that they are intelligently apprehended; and to have to occupy oneself withwhat is familiar can even arouse impatience −− and what is more familiar than just those determinations ofthought which we employ on every occasion, which pass our lips in every sentence we speak? It is the purpose of this foreword to indicate the general features of the course followed by knowing in itsadvance beyond a mere acquaintance with its objects, of the relation of philosophical [wissenschaftlichen]thinking to this natural thinking. This much, together with what was contained in the earlier Introduction, willbe sufficient to give a general idea of what is meant by logical cognition, the kind of preliminary general ideawhich is demanded in the case of any science prior to its exposition, that is, prior to the import of the scienceitself. § 17 In the first place, we must regard it as an infinite step forward that the forms of thought have been freed fromthe material in which they are submerged in self−conscious intuition, figurate conception, and in our desiringand willing, or rather in ideational desiring and willing −− and there is no human desiring or willing withoutideation −− and that these universalities have been brought into prominence for their own sake and madeobjects of contemplation as was done by Plato and after him especially by Aristotle; this constitutes thebeginning of the intelligent apprehension of them. Science of LogicPreface to the Second Edition6"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"'It was only', says Aristotle, 'after almost everything necessary and everything requisite for human comfortand intercourse was available, that man began to concern himself with philosophical knowledge' 'In Egypt',he had previously remarked, 'there was an early development of the mathematical sciences because there thepriestly caste at an early stage were in a position to have leisure'. § 18 As a matter of fact, the need to occupy oneself with pure thought presupposes that the human spirit mustalready have travelled a long road. In the silent regions of thought which has come to itself and communes only with itself, the interests whichmove the lives of races and individuals are hushed. it is, one may say, the need of the already satisfied needfor the necessities to which it must have attained, the need of a condition free from needs, of abstraction fromthe material of intuition, imagination, and so on, of the concrete interests of desire, instinct, will, in whichmaterial the determinations of thought are veiled and hidden. In the silent regions of thought which has cometo itself and communes only with itself, the interests which move the lives of races and individuals arehushed. § 19 'In so many respects', says Aristotle in the same context, 'the nature of man is in bondage; but this science,which is not studied for its utility, is the only absolutely free science and seems therefore to be a more thanhuman possession.' Philosophical thinking in general is still concerned with concrete objects −− God, nature,spirit; but logic is concerned only and solely with these thoughts as thoughts, in their complete abstraction.For this reason it is customary, to include logic in the curriculum of youth, for youth is not yet involved in thepractical affairs of life, living at leisure so far as they are concerned; and it is only for its own subjective endsthat it has to busy itself with acquiring the means to enable it to become actively engaged with the objects ofthose practical interests −− and still theoretically even with these. Contrary to Aristotle's view just mentioned,the science of logic is included in these means; the study of logic is a preliminary labour to be carried out inschool and it is not until later that the serious business of life and the pursuit of substantial ends begins. § 20 In life, the categories are used; from the honour of being contemplated for their own sakes they are degradedto the position where they serve in the creation and exchange of ideas involved in intellectual exercise on aliving content. First they serve as abbreviations through their universality (for what a host of particulars ofouter existence and actions is embraced by a conception −− battle, war, nation, ocean or animal, for example−− and in the conception of God or of love there is epitomised in the simplicity of such ideating an infinitehost of ideas, actions, states, etc.!). Secondly, the categories serve for the more exact determination and discovery of objective relations; but inthis process the import and purpose, the correctness and truth of the thought involved, are made to dependentirely on the subject matter itself and the thought determinations are not themselves credited with anyactive part in determining the content. Such a use of categories, which above was called natural logic, isunconscious; and when in philosophical reflection the categories are assigned the role of serving as means,then thinking as such is treated as something subordinate to the other activities of mind. We do not indeed sayof our feelings, impulses or interests that they serve us, rather do they count as independent forces andpowers, so that to have this particular feeling, to desire this, is what we are. But probably we are moreconscious of obeying our feelings, impulses, passions, interests, not to mention habits, than of having them inour possession, still less, in view of our intimate union with them, of their being at our disposal. Suchdeterminations of feeling and mind soon show themselves as particular in contrast to the universality which Science of LogicPreface to the Second Edition7"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"we are conscious ourselves of being and in which we have our freedom; and we are disposed to regardourselves as caught up in these particular states and dominated by them. § 21 Consequently it is much more difficult to believe that the forms of thought which permeate all our ideas −−whether these are purely theoretical or contain a matter belonging to feeling, impulse, will −− are means forus, rather than that we serve them, that in fact they have us in their possession; what is there more in us asagainst them, how shall we, how shall I, set myself up as more universal than they, which are universal assuch? When we give ourselves up to a sensation, a purpose, an interest, and in it feel ourselves confined and unfree,the place into which we can withdraw ourselves back into freedom is this region of self−certainty, of pureabstraction, of thought. Or again, to speak of things, we call the nature or the essence of things their notion,and this is only for thought; but still less shall we say of the notions of things that we dominate them, or thatthe determinations of thought of which they are the complex are at our service; on the contrary, it is ourthinking that must accommodate itself to them and our caprice or freedom ought not to want to mould themto suit itself. § 22 Since, therefore, subjective thought is our very own, innermost, act, and the objective notion of thingsconstitutes their essential import, we cannot go outside this our act, we cannot stand above it, and just as littlecan we go beyond the nature of things. We can however disregard the latter determination; in so far as itcoincides with the first it would yield a relation of our thoughts to the object, but this would be a valuelessresult because it would imply that the thing, the object, would be set up as a criterion for our notions and yetfor us the object can be nothing else but our notions of it. The way in which the critical philosophyunderstands the relationship of these three terms is that we place our thoughts as a medium instead ofconnecting us with the objects rather cuts us off from them. But this view can be countered by the simpleobservation that these very things which are supposed to stand beyond us, and at the other extreme, beyondthe thoughts referring to them, are themselves figments of subjective thought, and as wholly indeterminatethey are only a single thought−thing −− the so−called thing−in−itself of empty abstraction. § 23 Still, sufficient has been said of the point of view which no longer takes the determinations of thought to beonly an instrument and a means; more important is the further point connected with it, namely that it is usualto regard them as an external form. The activity of thought which is at work in all our ideas, purposes,interests and actions is, as we have said, unconsciously busy (natural logic); what we consciously attend to isthe contents, the objects of our ideas, that in which we are interested; on this basis, the determinations ofthought have the significance of forms which are only attached to the content, but are not the content itself.But if the truth of the matter is what we have already stated and also is generally admitted, namely that thenature, the peculiar essence, that which is genuinely permanent and substantial in the complexity andcontingency of appearance and fleeting manifestation, is the notion of the thing, the immanent universal, andthat each human being though infinitely unique is so primarily because he is a man, and each individualanimal is such individual primarily because it is an animal: if this is true, then it would be impossible to saywhat such an individual could still be if this foundation were removed, no matter how richly endowed theindividual might be with other predicates, if, that is, this foundation can equally be called a predicate like theothers. The indispensable foundation, the notion, the universal which is the thought itself, in so far as one canmake abstraction from the general idea expressed by the word 'thought', cannot be regarded as only anindifferent form attached to a content. But these thoughts of everything natural and spiritual, even the Science of LogicPreface to the Second Edition8"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"substantial content , still contain a variety of determinatenesses and are still charged with the difference of asoul and a body, of the notion and a relative reality; the profounder basis is the soul itself, the pure Notionwhich is the very heart of things, their simple life−pulse, even of subjective thinking of them. To focus attention on this logical nature which animates mind, moves and works in it, this is the task. Thebroad distinction between the instinctive act and the intelligent and free act is that the latter is performed withan awareness of what is being done; when the content of the interest in which one is absorbed is drawn out ofits immediate unity with oneself and becomes an independent object of one's thinking, then it is that spiritbegins to be free, whereas when thinking is an instinctive activity, spirit is enmeshed in the bonds of itscategories and is broken up into an infinitely varied material. § 24 Here and there in this mesh there are firm knots which give stability and direction to the life andconsciousness of spirit; these knots or nodes owe their fixity and power to the simple fact that having beenbrought before consciousness, they are independent, self−existent Notions of its essential nature. The mostimportant point for the nature of spirit is not only the relation of what it is in itself to what it is actually, butthe relation of what it knows itself to be to what it actually is; because spirit is essentially consciousness, thisself−knowing is a fundamental determination of its actuality. § 25 As impulses the categories are only instinctively active. At first they enter consciousness separately and soare variable and mutually confusing; consequently they afford to mind only a fragmentary and uncertainactuality; the loftier business of logic therefore is to clarify these categories and in them to raise mind tofreedom and truth. § 26 What we indicated as the beginning of the science [of logic] −− a beginning which we have alreadyrecognised as having a high value both on its own account and as a condition of genuine knowledge −−namely, the treatment of Notions generally and the moments of the Notion, that is, the determinations ofthought, primarily as forms which are distinct from the matter of thought and only attached to it, this attitudedirectly reveals itself as intrinsically inadequate for the attainment of truth −− and the truth is the declaredobject of and aim of logic. For, as such mere forms, as distinct from the content, they are assumed to bestanding in a determination which stamps them as finite and makes them incapable of holding the truth whichis in its own self infinite. In whatever respect the true may be associated with limitation and finitude, this isthe aspect of its negation, of its untruth and unreality, that is, of its end, not of the affirmation which, as thetrue, it is. § 27 Faced with the baldness of the merely formal categories, the instinct of healthy common sense has, in the end,felt itself to be so much in the right that it has contemptuously abandoned acquaintanceship with them to thedomain of school logic and metaphysics; at the same time, common sense fails to appreciate the value even ofa proper awareness of these fragments and is quite unaware that in the instinctive thinking of natural logic,and still more in the deliberate rejection of any acquaintance with or knowledge of the thought determinationsthemselves, it is in bondage to unclarified and therefore unfree thinking. The simple basic determination orcommon form of the collection of such forms is identity which, in the logic of this collection, is asserted asthe law of identity, as A = A, and as the principle of contradiction. Healthy common sense has so much lostits respect for the school which claims possession of such laws of truth and still busies itself with them that it Science of LogicPreface to the Second Edition9"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ridicules it and its laws and regards anyone as insufferable who can utter truths in accordance with such laws:the plant is −− a plant, science is −− science. It has also formed an equally just estimate of the significance ofthe formulas which constitute the rules of syllogising which in fact is a cardinal function of the understanding(although it would be a mistake not to recognise that these have their place in cognition where they must beobeyed); it knows that the formulas quite as well serve impartially error and sophistry and that however truthmay be defined, they cannot serve higher, for example, religious truth −− that generally speaking theyconcern only the correctness of the knowledge of facts, not truth itself. § 28 The inadequacy of this way of regarding thought which leaves truth on one side can only be made good byincluding in our conception of thought not only that which is usually reckoned as belonging to the externalform but the content as well. It is soon evident that what at first to ordinary reflection is, as content, divorcedfrom form, cannot in fact be formless, cannot be devoid of inner determination; if it were, then it would beonly vacuity, the abstraction of the thing−in−itself; that, on the contrary, the content in its own self possessesform, in fact it is through form alone that it has soul and meaning, and that it is form itself which istransformed only into the semblance of a content, hence into the semblance of something external to thissemblance. With this introduction of the content into the logical treatment, the subject matter is not things buttheir import, the Notion of them. But in this connection we can be reminded that there is a multitude ofNotions, a multitude of objects [Sache]. We have, however, already said how it is that restrictions areimposed on this multitude, that the Notion, simply as thought, as a universal, is the immeasurableabbreviation of the multitudes of particular things which are vaguely present to intuition and pictorialthought; but also a Notion is, first, in its own self the Notion, and this is only one and is the substantialfoundation; secondly, a Notion is determinate and it is this determinateness in it which appears as content: butthe determinateness of the Notion is a specific form of this substantial oneness, a moment of the form astotality, of that same Notion which is the foundation of the specific Notions. This Notion is not sensuously intuited or represented; it is solely an object, a product and content of thinking,and is the absolute, self−subsistent object, the logos, the reason of that which is, the truth of what we callthings; it is least of all the logos which should be left outside of the science of logic. Therefore its inclusion in or omission from this science must not be simply a matter of choice. When thosedeterminations of thought which are only external forms are truly considered in themselves, this can onlyresult in demonstrating their finitude and the untruth of their supposed independent self−subsistence, thattheir truth is the Notion. Consequently, the science of logic in dealing with the thought determinations whichin general run through our mind instinctively and unconsciously −− and even when they become part of thelanguage do not become objects of our attention −− will also be a reconstruction of those which are singledout by reflection and are fixed by it as subjective forms external to the matter and import of thedeterminations of thought. § 29 No subject matter is so absolutely capable of being expounded with a strict immanent plasticity as is thoughtin its own necessary development; no other brings with it this demand in such a degree; in this respect theScience of Logic must surpass even mathematics, for no subject matter has in its own self this freedom andindependence. Such an exposition would demand that at no stage of the development should anythought−determination or reflection occur which does not immediately emerge at this stage and that has notentered this stage from the one preceding it −− a requirement which is satisfied, after its fashion, in theprocess of mathematical reasoning. However, such an abstract perfection of exposition must, I admit, ingeneral be dispensed with; the very fact that the science must begin with what is absolutely simple, that is,with what is most general and of least import, would restrict the exposition solely to these same quite simple Science of LogicPreface to the Second Edition10"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"expressions of the simple without any further addition of a single word; all that could properly be admittedwould be negative considerations intended to ward off and banish any heterogeneous elements whichotherwise might be introduced by pictorial thought or unregulated thinking. However, such intrusiveelements in the simple immanent course of the development are themselves contingent, so that the effort toward them off is itself tainted with this contingency; besides which it is futile to try to deal with all of them,lying as they do outside the subject matter, and in any case, any demand for a systematic disposal of suchrandom reflections could only be partially satisfied. But the peculiar restlessness and distraction of ourmodern consciousness compel us to take some account of the more readily suggested reflections andopinions. A plastic discourse demands, too, a plastic receptivity and understanding on the part of the listener;but youths and men of such a temper who would calmly suppress their own reflections and opinions in whichoriginal thought is so impatient to manifest itself, listeners such as Plato feigned, who would attend only tothe matter in hand, could have no place in a modern dialogue; still less could one count on readers of such adisposition. On the contrary, I have been only too often and too vehemently attacked by opponents who wereincapable of making the simple reflection that their opinions and objections contain categories which arepresuppositions and which themselves need to be criticised first before they are employed. Ignorance in thismatter reaches incredible lengths; it is guilty of, the fundamental misunderstanding, the uncouth anduneducated behaviour of taking a category which is under consideration for something other than thecategory itself. This ignorance is the less justifiable because this 'something other' consists of determinatethoughts and concepts, and in a system of logic these other categories must likewise have been assigned theirown place and must themselves have been subjected to critical examination within the system. This ignoranceis most obvious in the great majority of the objections and attacks on the first Notions of logic, being andnothing, and becoming which, itself a simple determination −− the simplest analysis shows it to be so −−contains the two other determinations as moments. Thoroughness seems to require that the beginning, as thefoundation on which everything is built, should be examined before anything else, in fact that we should notgo any further until it has been firmly established and if, on the other hand, it is not, that we should reject allthat follows. § 30 This thoroughness at the same time has the advantage of guaranteeing that the labour of thinking shall bereduced to a minimum; it has before it, enclosed in this germ, the entire development and reckons that it hassettled the whole business when it has disposed of the beginning which is the easiest part of the business, forit is the simplest, the simple itself; it is the trifling effort of thought required to do this which reallyrecommends this 'thoroughness' which is so satisfied with itself. This restriction to what is simple gives scope for the free play of caprice which does not want to remainsimple but brings in its own reflections on the subject matter. Having good right to occupy itself at first onlywith the principle and in doing so not to concern itself with what lies beyond it, this thoroughness actuallyproceeds to do the opposite of this, for it does bring in what lies beyond, that is, categories other than thosewhich constitute the principle itself, other presuppositions and prejudices. Such presuppositions as thatinfinite is different from finitude, that content is other than form, that the inner is other than the outer, alsothat mediation is no immediacy (as if anyone did not know such things), are brought forward by way ofinformation and narrated and asserted rather than proved. But there is something stupid −− I can find no otherword for it −− about this didactic behaviour; technically it is unjustifiable simply to presuppose andstraightway assume such propositions; and, still more, it reveals ignorance of the fact that it is therequirement and the business of logical thinking to enquire into just this, whether such a finite withoutinfinity is something true, or whether such an abstract infinity, also a content without form and a formwithout content, an inner by itself which has no outer expression, an externality without an inwardness,whether any of these is something true or something actual. But this education and discipline of thinking bywhich it acquires plasticity and by which the impatience of casual reflection is overcome, is procured solelyby going further, by study and by carrying out to its conclusion the entire development.

Introduction. General Notion of Logic§ 33 In no science is the need to begin with the subject matter itself, without preliminary reflections, felt morestrongly than in the science of logic. In every other science the subject matter and the scientific method aredistinguished from each other; also the content does not make an absolute beginning but is dependent onother concepts and is connected on all sides with other material. These other sciences are, therefore, permittedto speak of their ground and its context and also of their method, only as premises taken for granted which, asforms of definitions and such−like presupposed as familiar and accepted, are to be applied straight−way, andalso to employ the usual kind of reasoning for the establishment of their general concepts and fundamentaldeterminations. § 34 Logic on the contrary, cannot presuppose any of these forms of reflection and laws of thinking, for theseconstitute part of its own content and have first to be established within the science. But not only the accountof scientific method, but even the Notion itself of the science as such belongs to its content, and in factconstitutes its final result; what logic is cannot be stated beforehand, rather does this knowledge of what it isfirst emerge as the final outcome and consummation of the whole exposition. Similarly, it is essentiallywithin the science that the subject matter of logic, namely, thinking or more specifically comprehensivethinking is considered; the Notion of logic has its genesis in the course of exposition and cannot therefore bepremised. Consequently, what is premised in this Introduction is not intended, as it were, to establish theNotion of Logic or to justify its method scientifically in advance, but rather by the aid of some reasoned andhistorical explanations and reflections to make more accessible to ordinary thinking the point of view fromwhich this science is to be considered. § 35 When logic is taken as the science of thinking in general, it is understood that this thinking constitutes themere form of a cognition that logic abstracts from all content and that the so−called second constituentbelonging to cognition, namely its matter, must come from somewhere else; and that since this matter is Science of LogicIntroduction. General Notion of Logic12"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"absolutely independent of logic, this latter can provide only the formal conditions of genuine cognition andcannot in its own self contain any real truth, not even be the pathway to real truth because just that which isessential in truth, its content, lies outside logic. § 36 But in the first place, it is quite inept to say that logic abstracts from all content, that it teaches only the rulesof thinking without any reference to what is thought or without being able to consider its nature. For asthinking and the rules of thinking are supposed to be the subject matter of logic, these directly constitute itspeculiar content; in them, logic has that second constituent, a matter, about the nature of which it isconcerned. § 37 But secondly, the conceptions on which the Notion of logic has rested hitherto have in part already beendiscarded, and for the rest, it is time that they disappeared entirely and that this science were grasped from ahigher standpoint and received a completely changed shape. § 38 Hitherto, the Notion of logic has rested on the separation, presupposed once and for all in the ordinaryconsciousness, of the content of cognition and its form, or of truth and certainty. First, it is assumed that thematerial of knowing is present on its own account as a ready−made world apart from thought, that thinkingon its own is empty and comes as an external form to the said material, fills itself with it and only thusacquires a content and so becomes real knowing. § 39 Further, these two constituents −− for they are supposed to be related to each other as constituents, andcognition is compounded from them in a mechanical or at best chemical fashion −− are appraised as follows:the object is regarded as something complete and finished on its own account, something which can entirelydispense with thought for its actuality, while thought on the other hand is regarded as defective because it hasto complete itself with a material and moreover, as a pliable indeterminate form, has to adapt itself to itsmaterial. Truth is the agreement of thought with the object, and in order to bring about this agreement −− forit does not exist on its own account −− thinking is supposed to adapt and accommodate itself to the object. § 40 Thirdly, when the difference of matter and form, of object and thought is not left in that nebulousindeterminateness but is taken more definitely, then each is regarded as a sphere divorced from the other.Thinking therefore in its reception and formation of material does not go outside itself; its reception of thematerial and the conforming of itself to it remains a modification of its own self, it does not result in thoughtbecoming the other of itself; and self−conscious determining moreover belongs only to thinking. In itsrelation to the object, therefore, thinking does not go out of itself to the object; this, as a thing−in−itself,remains a sheer beyond of thought. § 41 These views on the relation of subject and object to each other express the determinations which constitutethe nature of our ordinary, phenomenal consciousness; but when these prejudices are carried out into thesphere of reason as if the same relation obtained there, as if this relation were something true in its own self, Science of LogicIntroduction. General Notion of Logic13"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"then they are errors the −− refutation of which throughout every part of the spiritual and natural universe isphilosophy, or rather, as they bar the entrance to philosophy, must be discarded at its portals. § 42 Ancient metaphysics had in this respect a higher conception of thinking than is current today. For it baseditself on the fact that the knowledge of things obtained through thinking is alone what is really true in them,that is, things not in their immediacy but as first raised into the form of thought, as things thought. Thus thismetaphysics believed that thinking (and its determinations) is not anything alien to the object, but rather is itsessential nature, or that things and the thinking of them −− our language too expresses their kinship −− areexplicitly in full agreement, thinking in its immanent determinations and the true nature of things formingone and the same content. § 43 But reflective understanding took possession of philosophy. We must know exactly what is meant by thisexpression which moreover is often used as a slogan; in general it stands for the understanding as abstracting,and hence as separating and remaining fixed in its separations. Directed against reason, it behaves as ordinarycommon sense and imposes its view that truth rests on sensuous reality, that thoughts are only thoughts,meaning that it is sense perception which first gives them filling and reality and that reason left to its ownresources engenders only figments of the brain. In this self−renunciation on the part of reason, the Notion oftruth is lost; it is limited to knowing only subjective truth, only phenomena, appearances, only something towhich the nature of the object itself does not correspond: knowing has lapsed into opinion. § 44 However, this turn taken by cognition, which appears as a loss and a retrograde step, is based on somethingmore profound on which rests the elevation of reason into the loftier spirit of modern philosophy. The basisof that universally held conception is, namely, to be sought in the insight into the necessary conflict of thedeterminations of the understanding with themselves. The reflection already referred to is this, to transcendthe concrete immediate object and to determine it and separate it. But equally it must transcend these itsseparating determinations and straightway connect them. It is at the stage of this connecting of thedeterminations that their conflict emerges. This connecting activity of reflection belongs in itself to reasonand the rising above those determinations which attains to an insight into their conflict is the great negativestep towards the true Notion of reason. But the insight, when not thorough−going, commits the mistake ofthinking that it is reason which is in contradiction with itself; it does not recognise that the contradiction isprecisely the rising of reason above the limitations of the understanding and the resolving of them, Cognition,instead of taking from this stage the final step into the heights, has fled from the unsatisfactoriness of thecategories of the understanding to sensuous existence, imagining that in this it possesses what is solid andself−consistent. But on the other hand, since this knowledge is self−confessedly knowledge only ofappearances, the unsatisfactoriness of the latter is admitted, but at the same time presupposed: as much as tosay that admittedly, we have no proper knowledge of things−in−themselves but we do have a properknowledge of them within the sphere of appearances, as if, so to speak, only the kind of objects weredifferent, and one kind, namely things−in−themselves, did not fall within the scope of our knowledge but theother kind, phenomena, did. This is like attributing to someone a correct perception, with the rider thatnevertheless he is incapable of perceiving what is true but only what is false. Absurd as this would be, itwould not be more so than a true knowledge which did not know the object as it is in itself. § 45 Science of LogicIntroduction.

This can have no other meaning than that these forms are in themselvessomething untrue. But then if they are allowed to remain valid for subjective reason and experience, thecriticism has not produced any alteration in them: they are left in the same shape for the subject knower asthey formerly possessed for the object. If, however, they are inadequate for the thing−in−itself, still less mustthe understanding to which they are supposed to belong put up with them and rest content with them. If theycannot be determinations of the thing−in−itself, still less can they be determinations of the understanding towhich one ought at least to concede the dignity of a thing−in−itself. The determinations of finite and infiniteconflict in the same way, whether they are applied to time and space, to the world, or are determinationswithin the mind −− just as black and white produce grey whether they are mixed on a canvas or on thepalette. If our conception of the world is dissolved by the transference to it of the determinations of infiniteand finite, still more is spirit itself, which contains both of them, inwardly self−contradictory andself−dissolving: it is not the nature of the material or the object to which they are applied or in which theyoccur that can make a difference for it is only through those determinations and in accordance with them thatthe object contains the contradiction. § 46 The forms of objective thinking, therefore, have been removed by this criticism only from the thing; but theyhave been left in the subject just as they were originally. That is to say, this criticism did not consider theseforms on their own merits and according to their own peculiar content, but simply took them as acceptedstarting points from subjective logic: so that there was no question of an immanent deduction of them asforms of subjective logic, still less of a dialectical consideration of them. § 47 Transcendental idealism in its more consistent development, recognised the nothingness of the spectralthing−in−itself left over by the Kantian philosophy, this abstract shadow divorced from all content, andintended to destroy it completely. This philosophy also made a start at letting reason itself exhibit its owndeterminations. But this attempt, because it proceeded from a subjective standpoint, could not be brought to asuccessful conclusion. Later this standpoint, and with it too the attempt to develop the content of purescience, was abandoned. § 48 But what is commonly understood by logic is considered without any reference whatever to metaphysicalsignificance. This science in its present state has, it must be admitted, no content of a kind which the ordinaryconsciousness would regard as a reality and as a genuine subject matter. But it is not for this reason a formalscience lacking significant truth. Moreover, the region of truth is not to be sought in that matter which ismissing in logic, a deficiency to which the unsatisfactoriness of the science is usually attributed. The truth israther that the insubstantial nature of logical forms originates solely in the way in which they are consideredand dealt with. When they are taken as fixed determinations and consequently in their separation from eachother and not as held together in an organic unity, then they are dead forms and the spirit which is their living,concrete unity does not dwell in them. As thus taken, they lack a substantial content −− a matter which wouldbe substantial in itself. The content which is missing in the logical forms is nothing else than a solidfoundation and a concretion of these abstract determinations; and such a substantial being for them is usuallysought outside them. But logical reason itself is the substantial or real being which holds together within itself every abstractdetermination and is their substantial, absolutely concrete unity. One need not therefore look far for what iscommonly called a matter; if logic is supposed to lack a substantial content, then the fault does not lie with its Science of LogicIntroduction. General Notion of Logic15"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"subject matter but solely with the way in which this subject matter is grasped. § 49 This reflection leads up to the statement of the point of view from which logic is to be considered, how itdiffers from previous modes of treatment of this science which in future must always be based on this, theonly true standpoint. § 50 In the Phenomenology of Mind, I have exhibited consciousness in its movement onwards from the firstimmediate opposition of itself and the object to absolute knowing. The path of this movement goes throughevery form of the relation of consciousness to the object and has the Notion of science of its result. This Notion therefore (apart from the fact that it emerges within logic itself) needs no justification herebecause it has received it in that work; and it cannot be justified in any other way than by this emergence inconsciousness, all the forms of which are resolved into this Notion as into their truth. To establish or explainthe Notion of science ratiocinatively can at most achieve this, that a general idea of the Notion is presented toour thinking and a historical knowledge of it is produced; but a definition of science −− or more precisely oflogic −− has its proof solely in the already mentioned necessity of its emergence in consciousness. Thedefinition with which any science makes an absolute beginning. cannot contain anything other than theprecise and correct expression of what is imagined to be the accepted and familiar subject matter and aim ofthe science. That precisely this is what is imagined is an historical asseveration in respect of which one canonly appeal to such and such as recognised facts; or rather the plea can be advanced that such and such couldbe accepted as recognised facts. There will always be someone who will adduce a case, an instance,according to which something more and different is to be understood by certain terms the definition of whichmust therefore be made more precise or more general and the science too, must be accommodated thereto.This again involves argumentation about what should be admitted or excluded and within what limits and towhat extent; but argumentation is open to the most manifold and various opinions, on which a decision canfinally be determined only arbitrarily. In this method of beginning a science with its definition, no mention ismade of the need to demonstrate the necessity of its subject matter and therefore of the science itself. § 51 The Notion of pure science and its deduction is therefore presupposed in the present work in so far as thePhenomenology of Spirit is nothing other than the deduction of it. Absolute knowing is the truth of everymode of consciousness because, as the course of the Phenomenology showed, it is only in absolute knowingthat separation of the object from the certainty of itself is completely eliminated: truth is now equated withcertainty and this certainty with truth. § 52 Thus pure science presupposes liberation from the opposition of consciousness. It contains thought in so faras this is just as much the object in its own self, or the object in its own self in so far as it is equally purethought. As science, truth is pure self−consciousness in its self−development and has the shape of the self, sothat the absolute truth of being is the known Notion and the Notion as such is the absolute truth of being. § 53 This objective thinking then, is the content of pure science. Consequently, far from it being formal, far from itstanding in need of a matter to constitute an actual and true cognition, it is its content alone which has Science of LogicIntroduction. General Notion of Logic16"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"absolute truth, or, if one still wanted to employ the word matter, it is the veritable matter −− but a matterwhich is not external to the form, since this matter is rather pure thought and hance the absolute form itself.Accordingly, logic is to be understood as the system of pure reason, as the realm of pure thought. This realmis truth as it is without veil and in its own absolute nature. It can therefore be said that this content is theexposition of God as he is in his eternal essence before the creation of nature and a finite mind. § 54 Anaxagoras is praised as the man who first declared that Nous, thought, is the principle of the world, that theessence of the world is to be defined as thought. In so doing he laid the foundation for an intellectual view ofthe universe, the pure form of which must be logic. What we are dealing with in logic is not a thinking about something which exists independently as a base forour thinking and apart from it, nor forms which are supposed to provide mere signs or distinguishing marksof truth; on the contrary, the necessary forms and self−consciousness of thought are the content and theultimate truth itself. § 55 To get some idea of this one must discard the prejudice that truth must be something tangible. Suchtangibility is, for example, imported even into the Platonic Ideas which are in God's thinking, as if they are,as it were, existing things but in another world or region; while the world of actuality exists outside thatregion and has a substantial existence distinct from those Ideas and only through this distinction is asubstantial reality. The Platonic Idea is the universal, or more definitely the Notion of an object; only in itsNotion does something possess actuality and to the extent that it is distinct from its Notion it ceases to beactual and is a non−entity; the side of tangibility and sensuous self−externality belongs to this null aspect. Buton the other side, one can appeal to the conceptions of ordinary logic itself; for it is assumed, for example,that the determinations contained in definitions do not belong only to the knower, but are determinations ofthe object, constituting its innermost essence and its very own nature. Or, if from given determinations othersare inferred, it is assumed that what is inferred is not something external and alien to the object, but ratherthat it belongs to the object itself, that to the thought there is a correspondent being. § 56 It is implied generally in the use of forms of the Notion, of judgement, syllogism, definition, division, etc.,that they are not merely forms of self−conscious thinking but also of the objective understanding. Thought is an expression which attributes the determination contained therein primarily to consciousness. Butinasmuch as it is said that understanding, reason, is in the objective world, that mind and nature haveuniversal laws to which their life and changes conform, then it is conceded that the determinations of thoughtequally have objective value and existence. § 57 The critical philosophy had, it is true, already turned metaphysics into logic but it, like the later idealism, aspreviously remarked, was overawed by the object, and so the logical determinations were given an essentiallysubjective significance with the result that these philosophies remained burdened with the object they hadavoided and were left with the residue of a thing−in−itself, an infinite obstacle, as a beyond. But theliberation from the opposition of consciousness which the science of logic must be able to presuppose liftsthe determinations of thought above this timid, incomplete standpoint and demands that they be considerednot with any such limitation and reference but as they are in their own proper character, as logic, as pure Science of LogicIntroduction.

Now if logic has not undergone any change since Aristotle −− and in fact, judging bymodern compendiums of logic the changes frequently consist mainly in omissions −− then surely theconclusion which should be drawn is that it is all the more in need of a total reconstruction; for spirit, after itslabours over two thousand years, must have attained to a higher consciousness about its thinking and about itsown pure, essential nature. A comparison of the forms to which spirit has raised itself in the practical and religious sphere and in everybranch of science both physical and mental, with the form presented by logic which is spirit's consciousnessof its own pure essence, reveals so vast a difference that the utter inadequacy and unworthiness of the latterconsciousness in comparison with the higher consciousness displayed in those other spheres cannot fail tostrike the most superficial observer. § 59 In point of fact the need for a reconstruction of logic has long since been felt. In form and in content, logic, asexhibited in the text−books, may be said to have fallen into contempt. It is still dragged in, but more from afeeling that one cannot dispense with logic altogether and because the tradition of its importance stillsurvives, rather than from a conviction that such commonplace content and occupation with such emptyforms is valuable and useful. § 60 The additions of psychological, pedagogic and even physiological material which logic received in the pasthave subsequently been recognised almost universally as disfigurements. A great part of these psychological,pedagogic and physiological observations, laws and rules, whether they occur in logic or anywhere else, mustappear very shallow and trivial in themselves; and without exception all those rules such as, for example, thatone must think out and test what one reads in books or hears by word of mouth, that when one's sight is notgood one should help one's eyes by wearing spectacles −− rules which in textbooks of so−called applied logicwere solemnly set out in paragraphs and put forward as aids to the attainment of truth −− these must strikeeveryone as superfluous −− except only the writer or teacher who finds difficulty in expanding by somemeans or other the otherwise scanty and life−less content of logic.' § 61 Regarding this content, the reason why logic is so dull and spiritless has already been given above. Itsdeterminations are accepted in their unmoved fixity and are brought only into external relation with eachother. In judgments and syllogisms the operations are in the main reduced to and founded on the quantitativeaspect of the determinations; consequently everything rests on an external difference, on mere comparisonand becomes a completely analytical procedure and mechanical calculation. The deduction of the so−calledrules and laws, chiefly of inference, is not much better than a manipulation of rods of unequal length in orderto sort and group them according to size −− than a childish game of fitting together the pieces of a colouredpicture puzzle.

In arithmetic, numbers are regarded as devoid of any concrete conceptual content, so apart fromtheir wholly external relationship they have no meaning, and neither in themselves nor in theirinterrelationships are thoughts. When it is calculated in mechanical fashion that three−fourths multiplied bytwo−thirds makes one−half, this operation contains about as much and as little thought as calculating whetherin a logical figure this or that kind of syllogism is valid. § 62 Before these dead bones of logic can be quickened by spirit, and so become possessed of a substantial,significant content, its method must be that which alone can enable it to be pure science. In the present stateof logic one can scarcely recognise even a trace of scientific method. It has roughly the form of an empiricalscience. The empirical sciences have found for their own appropriate purposes their own peculiar method,such as it is, of defining and classifying their material. Pure mathematics, too, has its method which isappropriate for its abstract objects and for the quantitative form in which alone it considers them. I have saidwhat is essential in the preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit about this method and, in general, thesubordinate form of scientific method which can be employed in mathematics; but it will also be consideredin more detail in the logic itself. Spinoza, Wolff and others have let themselves be misled in applying it alsoto philosophy and in making the external course followed by Notion−less quantity, the course of the Notion,a procedure which is absolutely contradictory. Hitherto philosophy had not found its method; it regarded with envy the systematic structure of mathematics,and, as we have said, borrowed it or had recourse to the method of sciences which are only amalgams ofgiven material, empirical propositions and thoughts −− or even resorted to crude rejection of all method. However, the exposition of what alone can be the true method of philosophical science falls within thetreatment of logic itself; for the method is the consciousness of the form of the inner self−movement of thecontent of logic. . In the Phenomenology of Mind I have expounded an example of this method in application to a moreconcrete object, namely to consciousness. Here we are dealing with forms of consciousness each of which inrealising itself at the same time resolves itself, has for its result its own negation −− and so passes into ahigher form . All that is necessary to achieve scientific progress −− and it is essential to strive to gain thisquite simple insight −− is the recognition of the logical principle that the negative is just as much positive, orthat what is self−contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, into abstract nothingness, but essentiallyonly into the negation of its particular content, in other words, that such a negation is not all and everynegation but the negation of a specific subject matter which resolves itself, and consequently is a specificnegation, and therefore the result essentially contains that from which it results; which strictly speaking is atautology, for otherwise it would be an immediacy, not a result. Because the result, the negation, is a specificnegation, it has content. It is a fresh Notion but higher and richer than its predecessor; for it is richer by thenegation or opposite of the latter, therefore contains it, but also something more, and is the unity of itself andits opposite. It is in this way that the system of Notions as such has to be formed −− and has to complete itselfin a purely continuous course in which nothing extraneous is introduced. § 63 I could not pretend that the method which I follow in this system of logic −− or rather which this system in itsown self follows −− is not capable of greater completeness, of much elaboration in detail; but at the sametime I know that it is the only true method. This is self−evident simply from the fact that it is not somethingdistinct from its object and content; for it is the inwardness of the content, the dialectic which it possesseswithin itself, which is the mainspring of its advance. It is clear that no expositions can be accepted as Science of LogicIntroduction. General Notion of Logic19"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"scientifically valid which do not pursue the course of this method and do not conform to its simple rhythm,for this is the course of the subject matter itself. § 64 In conformity with this method, I would point out that the divisions and headings of the books, sections andchapters given in this work as well as the explanations associated with them, are made to facilitate apreliminary survey and strictly are only of historical value. They do not belong to the content and body of thescience but are compilations of an external reflection which has already run through the whole of theexposition and consequently knows and indicates in advance the sequence of its moments before these arebrought forward by the subject matter itself. § 65 Similarly in the other sciences, such preliminary definitions and divisions are in themselves nothing else butsuch external indications; but even within the particular science they are not raised above this status. Even inlogic, for example, we may be told perhaps that 'logic has two main parts, the theory of elements andmethodology', then under the former there straightway follows perhaps the superscription, Laws of Thought;and then, Chapter I: Concepts. First Section: Of the Clearness of Concepts, and so on. These definitions anddivisions, made without any deduction or justification, constitute the systematic framework and the entireconnectedness of such sciences. Such a logic regards it as its vocation to talk about the necessity of deducingconcepts and truths from principles; but as regards what it calls method, the thought of a deduction of itsimply does not occur to it. The procedure consists, perhaps, in grouping together what is similar and makingwhat is simple precede what is complex, and other external considerations. But as regards any inner, necessary connectedness, there is nothing more than the list of headings of thevarious parts and the transition is effected simply by saying Chapter II, or We come now to the judgements,and the like. § 66 The superscriptions and divisions, too, which appear in this system are not themselves intended to have anyother significance than that of a list of contents. Besides, the immanent coming−to−be of the distinctions andthe necessity of their connection with each other must present themselves in the exposition of the subjectmatter itself for it falls within the spontaneous progressive determination of the Notion. § 67 That which enables the Notion to advance itself is the already mentioned negative which it possesses withinitself; it is this which constitutes the genuine dialectical moment. Dialectic in this way acquires an entirelydifferent significance from what it had when it was considered as a separate part of Logic and when its aimand standpoint were, one may say, completely misunderstood. Even the Platonic dialectic, in the Parmenidesitself and elsewhere even more directly, on the one hand, aims only at abolishing and refuting assertionsthrough themselves and on the other hand, has for its result simply nothingness. Dialectic is commonly regarded as an external, negative activity which does not pertain to the subject matteritself, having its ground in mere conceit as a subjective itch for unsettling and destroying what is fixed andsubstantial, or at least having for its result nothing but the worthlessness of the object dialecticallyconsidered. § 68 Science of LogicIntroduction. General Notion of Logic20"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Kant rated dialectic higher −− and this is among his greatest merits −− for he freed it from the seemingarbitrariness which it possesses from the standpoint of ordinary thought and exhibited it as a necessaryfunction of reason. Because dialectic was held to be merely the art of practising deceptions and producingillusions, the assumption was made forthwith that it is only a spurious game, the whole of its power restingsolely on concealment of the deceit and that its results are obtained only surreptitiously and are a subjectiveillusion. True, Kant's expositions in the antinomies of pure reason, when closely examined as they will be atlength in the course of this work, do not indeed deserve any great praise; but the general idea on which hebased his expositions and which he vindicated, is the objectivity of the illusion and the necessity of thecontradiction which belongs to the nature of thought determinations: primarily, it is true, with thesignificance that these determinations are applied by reason to things in themselves; but their nature isprecisely what they are in reason and with reference to what is intrinsic or in itself. This result, grasped in its positive aspect, is nothing else but the inner negativity of the determinations as theirself−moving soul, the principle of all natural and spiritual life. But if no advance is made beyond the abstract negative aspect of dialectic, the result is only the familiar onethat reason is incapable of knowing the infinite; a strange result for −− since the infinite is the Reasonable −−it asserts that reason is incapable of knowing the Reasonable. § 69 It is in this dialectic as it is here understood, that is, in the grasping of opposites in their unity or of thepositive in the negative, that speculative thought consists. It is the most important aspect of dialectic, but for thinking which is as yet unpractised and unfree it is themost difficult. Such thinking, if it is still engaged in breaking itself of the habit of employing sensuouslyconcrete terms and of ratiocination, must first practise abstract thinking, hold fast Notions in theirdeterminateness and learn to cognise by means of them. An exposition of logic to this end would, in itsmethod, have to keep to the division of the subject above−mentioned and with regard to the more detailedcontents, to the definitions given for the particular Notions without touching on the dialectical aspect. Asregards its external 'structure, such an exposition would resemble the usual presentation of this science, but itwould also be distinguished from it with respect to the content and still would serve for practice in abstractthinking, though not in speculative thinking, a purpose which can never be realised by the logic which hasbecome popular through the addition of psychological and anthropological material. It would give to mindthe picture of a methodically ordered whole, although the soul of the structure, the method (which dwells inthe dialectical aspect) would not itself appear in it. § 70 Finally, with respect to education and the relation of the individual to logic, I would further remark that thisscience, like grammar, appears in two different aspects or values. It is one thing for him who comes to it andthe sciences generally for the first time, but it is another thing for him who comes back to it from thesesciences. He who begins the study of grammar finds in its forms and laws dry abstractions, arbitrary rules, ingeneral an isolated collection of definitions and terms which exhibit only the value and significance of whatis implied in their immediate meaning; there is nothing to be known in them other than themselves. On theother hand, he who has mastered a language and at the same time has a comparative knowledge of otherlanguages, he alone can make contact with the spirit and culture of a people through the grammar of itslanguage; the same rules and forms now have a substantial, living value. Similarly, he who approaches thisscience at first finds in logic an isolated system of abstractions which, confined within itself, does notembrace within its scope the other knowledges and sciences.

General Notion of Logic21"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"On the contrary, when contrasted with the wealth of the world as pictorially conceived, with the apparentlyreal content of the other sciences, and compared with the promise of absolute science to unveil the essentialbeing of this wealth, the inner nature of mind and the world, the truth, then this science in its abstract shape,in the colourless, cold simplicity of its pure determinations looks as if it could achieve anything sooner thanthe fulfilment of its promise and seems to confront that richness as an empty, insubstantial form. The firstacquaintance with logic confines its significance to itself alone; its content passes only for a detachedoccupation with the determinations of thought, alongside which other scientific activities possess on theirown account a matter and content of their own, on which logic may perhaps have a formal influence, thoughan influence which comes only from itself and which if necessary can of course also be dispensed with so faras the scientific structure and its study are concerned. The other sciences have on the whole discarded the correct method, that is, a sequence of definitions, axioms,theorems and their proofs, etc.; so−called natural logic now has its own validity in the sciences and managesto get along without any special knowledge of the nature of thought itself. But the matter and content of thesesciences is held to be completely independent of logic and also has more appeal for sense, feeling, figurateconception, and practical interest of any kind. § 71 At first, therefore, logic must indeed be learnt as something which one understands and sees into quite wellbut in which, at the beginning, one feels the lack of scope and depth and a wider significance. It is only afterprofounder acquaintance with the other sciences that logic ceases to be for subjective spirit a merely abstractuniversal and reveals itself as the universal which embraces within itself the wealth of the particular −− justas the same proverb, in the mouth of a youth who understands it quite well, does not possess the wide rangeof meaning which it has in the mind of a man with the experience of a lifetime behind him, for who, themeaning is expressed in all its power. Thus the value of logic is only apprehended when it is preceded byexperience of the sciences; it then displays itself to mind as the universal truth, not as a particular knowledgealongside other matters and realities, but as the essential being of all these latter. § 72 Now although the mind is not conscious of this power of logic at the beginning of its study, it none the lessreceives within itself through such study the power which leads it into all truth. The system of logic is therealm of shadows, the world of simple essentialities freed from all sensuous concreteness. The study of thisscience, to dwell and labour in this shadowy realm, is the absolute culture and discipline of consciousness. Inlogic, consciousness is busy with something remote from sensuous intuitions and aims, from feelings, fromthe merely imagined world of figurate conception. Considered from its negative aspect, this business consistsin holding off the contingency of ordinary thinking and the arbitrary selection of particular grounds −− ortheir opposites −− as valid. § 73 But above all, thought acquires thereby self−reliance and independence. It becomes at home in abstractionsand in progressing by means of Notions free from sensuous substrata, develops an unsuspected power ofassimilating in rational form all the various knowledges and sciences in their complex variety, of graspingand retaining them in their essential character, stripping them of their external features and in this wayextracting from them the logical element, or what is the same thing, filling the abstract basis of Logicacquired by study with the substantial content of absolute truth and giving it the value of a universal which nolonger stands as a particular alongside other particulars but includes them all within its grasp and is theiressence, the absolutely True. Science of LogicIntroduction. General Notion of Logic22"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"General Division of Logic § 74 From what has been said about the Notion of this science and where its justification is to be found, it followsthat the general division of it here can only be provisional, can be given, as it were, only in so far as theauthor is already familiar with the science and consequently is historically in a position to state here inadvance the main distinctions which will emerge in the development of the Notion. § 75 Still, the attempt can be made to promote an understanding beforehand of what is requisite for such adivision, even though in doing so we must have recourse to an application of the method which will only befully understood and justified within the science itself. We must therefore point out at the start that we arepresupposing that the division must be connected with the Notion, or rather must be implicit in the Notionitself. The Notion is not indeterminate but is in its own self determinate; the division, however, expresses thisits determinateness as developed; it is the judgement of the Notion, not a judgement about some object orother picked up from outside, but the judging, that is, determining, of the Notion in its own self. § 76 The quality of being right−angled, acute−angled or equilateral, according to which triangles are classified, isnot implicit in the determinateness of the triangle itself, that is, not in what is usually called the Notion of thetriangle, just as little as there is implicit in what passes for the Notion of animal as such, or of the mammal,bird, etc. the determinations governing the classification into mammal, bird, etc., and the subdivision of theseclasses into other species. Such determinations are taken from elsewhere and are annexed to such so−calledNotion from outside. In the philosophical treatment of classification or division, the Notion itself must showthat it is itself the course of those determinations. § 77 But in the Introduction, the Notion of logic was itself stated to be the result of a preceding science, and sohere, too, it is a presupposition. In accordance with that result logic was defined as the science of purethought, the principle of which is pure knowing, the unity which is not abstract but a living, concrete unity invirtue of the fact that in it the opposition in consciousness between a self−determined entity, a subject, and asecond such entity, an object, is known to be overcome; being is known to be the pure Notion in its own self,and the pure Notion to be the true being. These, then, are the two moments contained in logic. But now theyare known to be inseparable, not as in consciousness where each also has a separate being of its own; it issolely because they are at the same time known as distinct (yet not with an independent being) that their unityis not abstract, dead and inert, but concrete. § 78 This unity also constitutes the logical principle as element, so that the development of the difference directlypresent in that principle proceeds only within this element. For since the division is, as we have said, thejudgement of the Notion, the positing of the determination already immanent in it, and therefore of thedifference, we must not understand this positing as a resolving of that concrete unity back into itsdeterminations as if these had an independent self−subsistence, for this would be an empty return to theprevious standpoint, to the opposition of consciousness. This however has vanished; the said unity remainsthe element, and the distinctions of the division and of the development no longer originate outside thatelement. Consequently the earlier determinations (those used on the pathway to truth) such as subjectivity Science of LogicIntroduction. General Notion of Logic23"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"and objectivity, or even thought and being, or Notion and reality, no matter from what standpoint they weredetermined, have lost their independent and purely affirmative character and are now in their truth, that is, intheir unity, reduced to forms. In their difference, therefore, they themselves remain implicitly the wholeNotion, and this, in the division, is posited only under its own specifications. § 79 Thus what is to be considered is the whole Notion, firstly as the Notion in the form of being, secondly, as theNotion; in the first case, the Notion is only in itself, the Notion of reality or being; in the second case, it is theNotion as such, the Notion existing for itself (as it is, to name concrete forms, in thinking man, and even inthe sentient animal and in organic individuality generally, although, of course, in these it is not conscious,still less known; it is only in inorganic nature that it is in itself). Accordingly, logic should be dividedprimarily into the logic of the Notion as being and of the Notion as Notion −− or, by employing the usualterms (although these as least definite are most ambiguous) into 'objective' and 'subjective' logic. § 80 But in accordance with the fundamental element of the immanent unity of the Notion, and hence with theinseparability of its determinations, these latter, when distinguished from each other in the positing of theNotion in its difference, must at least also stand in relation to each other. There results a sphere of mediation,the Notion as a system of reflected determinations, that is, of being in process of transition into thebeing−within−self or inwardness of the Notion. In this way, the Notion is not yet posited as such for itself,but is still fettered by the externality of immediate being. This is the doctrine of essence which standsmidway between the doctrine of being and that of the Notion. In the general division of logic in the presentwork it has been included in objective logic because although essence is already the inwardness of being, thecharacter of subject is to be expressly reserved for the Notion. § 81 Recently Kant has opposed to what has usually been called logic another, namely, a transcendental logic.What has here been called objective logic would correspond in part to what with him is transcendental logic.He distinguishes it from what he calls general logic in this way, [a] that it treats of the notions which refer apriori to objects, and consequently does not abstract from the whole content of objective cognition, or, inother words, it contains the rules of the pure thinking of an object, and [b] at the same time it treats of theorigin of our cognition so far as this cognition cannot be ascribed to the objects. It is to this second aspect thatKant's philosophical interest is exclusively directed. § 82 His chief thought is to vindicate the categories for self−consciousness as the subjective ego. By virtue of thisdetermination and its opposition; and besides the empirical element of feeling and intuition it has somethingelse left over which is not posited and determined by thinking self−consciousness, a thing−in−itself,something alien and external to thought −− although it is easy to perceive that such an abstraction as thething−in−itself is itself only a product of thought, and of merely abstractive thought at that. If other disciplesof Kant have expressed themselves concerning the determining of the object by the ego in this way, that theobjectifying of the ego is to be regarded as an original and necessary act of consciousness, so that in thisoriginal act there is not yet the idea of the ego itself −− which would be a consciousness of that consciousnessor even an objectifying of it −− then this objectifying act, in its freedom from the opposition ofconsciousness, is nearer to what may be taken simply for thought as such. [2] Footnote Science of LogicIntroduction. General Notion of Logic24"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"1. I would mention that in this work I frequently refer to the Kantian philosophy (which to many may seemsuperfluous) because whatever may be said, both in this work and elsewhere, about the precise character ofthis philosophy and about particular parts of its exposition, it constitutes the base and the starting point ofrecent German philosophy and that its merit remains unaffected by whatever faults may be found in it. Thereason too why reference must often be made to it in the objective logic is that it enters into detailedconsideration of important, more specific aspects of logic, whereas later philosophical works have paid littleattention to these and in some instances have only displayed a crude −− not unavenged −− contempt for them.The philosophising which is most widespread among us does not go beyond the Kantian results, that Reasoncannot acquire knowledge of any true content or subject matter and in regard to absolute truth must bedirected to faith. But what with Kant is a result, forms the immediate starting−point in this philosophising, sothat the preceding exposition from which that result issued and which is a philosophical cognition, is cutaway beforehand. The Kantian philosophy thus serves as a cushion for intellectual indolence which soothesitself with the conviction that everything is already proved and settled. Consequently for genuine knowledge,for a specific content of thought which is not to be found in such barren and arid complacency, one must turnto that preceding exposition. 2. If the expression 'objectifying act of the ego' suggests other products of spirit, e.g. fantasy, it is to beobserved that we are speaking of a determining of an object in so far as the elements of its content do notbelong to feeling and intuition. Such an object is a thought, and to determine it means partly, first to produceit, partly, in so far as it is something presupposed, to have further thoughts about it, to develop it further bythought. § 83 But this act should no longer be called consciousness; consciousness embraces within itself the opposition ofthe ego and its object which is not present in that original act. The name consciousness gives it a semblanceof subjectivity even more than does the term thought, which here, however, is to be taken simply in theabsolute sense as infinite thought untainted by the finitude of consciousness, in short, thought as such. § 84 Now because the interest of the Kantian philosophy was directed to the so−called transcendental aspect of thecategories, the treatment of the categories themselves yielded a blank result; what they are in themselveswithout the abstract relation to the ego common to all, what is their specific nature relatively to each otherand their relationship to each other, this has not been made an object of consideration. Hence this philosophyhas not contributed in the slightest to a knowledge of their nature; what alone is of interest in this connectionoccurs in the Critique of Ideas. But if philosophy was to make any real progress, it was necessary that theinterest of thought should be drawn to a consideration of the formal side, to a consideration of the ego, ofconsciousness as such, i.e. of the abstract relation of a subjective knowing to an object, so that in this way thecognition of the infinite form, that is, of the Notion, would be introduced. But in order that this cognition maybe reached, that form has still to be relieved of the finite determinateness in which it is ego, or consciousness.The form, when thus thought out into its purity, will have within itself the capacity to determine itself, that is,to give itself a content, and that a necessarily explicated content in the form of a system of determinations ofthought. § 85 The objective logic, then, takes the place rather of the former metaphysics which was intended to be thescientific construction of the world in terms of thoughts alone. If we have regard to the final shape of thisscience, then it is first and immediately ontology whose place is taken by objective logic −− that part of thismetaphysics which was supposed to investigate the nature of ens in general; ens comprises both being and Science of LogicIntroduction. General Notion of Logic25"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"essence, a distinction for which the German language has fortunately preserved different terms. But further,objective logic also comprises the rest of metaphysics in so far as this attempted to comprehend with theforms of pure thought particular substrata taken primarily from figurate conception, namely the soul, theworld and God; and the determinations of thought constituted what was essential in the mode ofconsideration. Logic, however, considers these forms free from those substrata, from the subjects of figurateconception; it considers them, their nature and worth, in their own proper character. Former metaphysicsomitted to do this and consequently incurred the just reproach of having employed these forms uncriticallywithout a preliminary investigation as to whether and how they were capable of being determinations of thething−in−itself, to use the Kantian expression −− or rather of the Reasonable. Objective logic is therefore thegenuine critique of them −− a critique which does not consider them as contrasted under the abstract forms ofthe a priori and the a posteriori, but considers the determinations themselves according to their specificcontent. § 86 The subjective logic is the logic of the Notion, of essence which has sublated its relation to being or itsillusory being [Schein], and in its determination is no longer external but is subjective free, self−subsistentand self−determining, or rather it is the subject itself. Since subjectivity brings with it the misconception ofcontingency and caprice and, in general, characteristics belonging to the form of consciousness, no particularimportance is to be attached here to the distinction of subjective and objective; these determinations will bemore precisely developed later on in the logic itself. § 87 Logic thus falls generally into objective and subjective logic, but more specifically it has three parts: I The logic of beingII The logic of essence, andIII The logic of the NotionWith What must Science Begin?§ 88 It is only in recent times that thinkers have become aware of the difficulty of finding a beginning inphilosophy, and the reason for this difficulty and also the possibility of resolving it has been much discussed.What philosophy begins with must be either mediated or immediate, and it is easy to show that it can beneither the one nor the other; thus either way of beginning is refuted. § 89 The principle of a philosophy does, of course, also express a beginning, but not so much a subjective as anobjective one, the beginning of everything. The principle is a particular determinate content −− water, theone, nous, idea, substance, monad, etc. Or, if it refers to the nature of cognition and consequently is supposedto be only a criterion rather than an objective determination −− thought, intuition, sensation, ego, subjectivityitself. Then here too it is the nature of the content which is the point of interest. The beginning as such, on theother hand, as something subjective in the sense of being a particular, inessential way of introducing thediscourse, remains unconsidered, a matter of indifference, and so too the need to find an answer to thequestion, With what should the beginning be made? remains of no importance in face of the need for aprinciple in which alone the interest of the matter in hand seems to lie, the interest as to what is the truth, theabsolute ground. Science of LogicWith What must Science Begin?26"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"§ 90 But the modern perplexity about a beginning proceeds from a further requirement of which those who areconcerned with the dogmatic demonstration of a principle or who are sceptical about finding a subjectivecriterion against dogmatic philosophising, are not yet aware, and which is completely denied by those whobegin, like a shot from a pistol, from their inner revelation, from faith, intellectual Intuition, etc., and whowould be exempt from method and logic. If earlier abstract thought was interested in the principle only ascontent, but in the course of philosophical development has been impelled to pay attention to the other side,to the behaviour of the cognitive process, this implies that the subjective act has also been grasped as anessential moment of objective truth, and this brings with it the need to unite the method with the content, theform with the principle. Thus the principle ought also to be the beginning, and what is the first for thoughtought also to be the first in the process of thinking. § 91 Here we have only to consider how the logical beginning appears; the two sides from which it can be takenhave already been named, to wit, either as a mediated result or as a beginning proper, as an immediacy. § 92 This is not the place to deal with the question apparently so important in present−day thought, whether theknowledge of truth is an immediate knowledge having a pure beginning, a faith, or whether it is a mediatedknowledge . In so far as this can be dealt with preliminarily it has been done elsewhere. Here we need onlyquote from it this, there is nothing, nothing in heaven, or in nature or in mind or anywhere else which doesnot equally contain both immediacy and mediation, so that these two determinations reveal themselves to beunseparated and inseparable and the opposition between them to be a nullity. But as regards the philosophicaldiscussion of this, it is to be found in every logical proposition in which occur the determinations ofimmediacy and mediation and consequently also the discussion of their opposition and their truth. Inasmuchas this opposition, as related to thinking, to knowing, to cognition, acquires the more concrete form ofimmediate of mediated knowledge, it is the nature of cognition as such which is considered within the scienceof logic, while the more concrete form of cognition falls to be considered in the philosophy of spirit. But towant the nature of cognition clarified prior to the science is to demand that it be considered outside thescience; outside the science this cannot be accomplished, at least not in a scientific manner and such a manneris alone here in place. § 93 The beginning is logical in that it is to be made in the element of thought that is free and for itself, in pureknowing. It is mediated because pure knowing is the ultimate, absolute truth of consciousness. In theIntroduction it was remarked that the phenomenology of spirit is the science of consciousness, the expositionof it, and that consciousness has for result the Notion of science, i.e. pure knowing. Logic, then, has for itspresupposition the science of manifested spirit, which contains and demonstrates the necessity, and so thetruth, of the standpoint occupied by pure knowing and of its mediation. In this science of manifested spirit thebeginning is made from empirical, sensuous consciousness and this is immediate knowledge in the strictsense of the word; in that work there is discussed the significance of this immediate knowledge. Other formsof consciousness such as belief in divine truths, inner experience, knowledge through inner revelation, etc.,are very ill−fitted to be quoted as examples of immediate knowledge as a little reflection will show. In thework just mentioned immediate consciousness is also the first and that which is immediate in the scienceitself, and therefore the presupposition; but in logic, the presupposition is that which has proved itself to bethe result of that phenomenological consideration −− the Idea as pure knowledge. Science of LogicWith What must Science Begin?27"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"§ 94 Logic is pure science, that is, pure knowledge in the entire range of its development. But in the said result,this Idea has determined itself to be the certainty which has become truth, the certainty which, on the onehand, no longer has the object over against it but has internalised it, knows it as its own self −− and, on theother hand, has given up the knowledge of itself as of something confronting the object of which it is only theannihilation, has divested itself of this subjectivity and is at one with its self−alienation. § 95 Now starting from this, determination of pure knowledge, all that is needed to ensure that the beginningremains immanent in its scientific development is to consider, or rather, ridding oneself of all otherreflections and opinions whatever, simply to take up, what is there before us. § 96 Pure knowing as concentrated into this unity has sublated all reference to an other and to mediation; it iswithout any distinction and as thus distinctionless, ceases itself to be knowledge; what is present is onlysimple immediacy. § 97 Simple immediacy is itself an expression of reflection and contains a reference to its distinction from what ismediated. This simple immediacy, therefore, in its true expression is pure being. Just as pure knowing is tomean knowing as such, quite abstractly, so too pure being is to mean nothing but being in general: being, andnothing else, without any further specification and filling. § 98 Here the beginning is made with being which is represented as having come to be through mediation, amediation which is also a sublating of itself; and there is presupposed pure knowing as the outcome of finiteknowing, of consciousness. But if no presupposition is to be made and the beginning itself is takenimmediately, then its only determination is that it is to be the beginning of logic, of thought as such. All thatis present is simply the resolve, which can also be regarded as arbitrary, that we propose to consider thoughtas such. § 99 Thus the beginning must be an absolute, or what is synonymous here, an abstract beginning; and so it maynot suppose anything, must not be mediated by anything nor have a ground; rather it is to be itself the groundof the entire science. Consequently, it must be purely and simply an immediacy, or rather merely immediacyitself. Just as it cannot possess any determination relatively to anything else, so too it cannot contain withinitself any determination, any content; for any such would be a distinguishing and an inter−relationship ofdistinct moments, and consequently a mediation. The beginning therefore is pure being § 100 To this simple exposition of what is only directly involved in the simplest of all things, the logical beginning,we may add the following further reflections; yet these cannot be meant to serve as elucidations andconfirmations of that exposition −− this is complete in itself −− since they are occasioned by preconceivedideas and reflections and these, like all other preliminary prejudices, must be disposed of within the science Science of LogicWith What must Science Begin?28"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"itself where their treatment should be awaited with patience. § 101 The insight that absolute truth must be a result, and conversely, that a result presupposes a prior truth which,however, because it is a first, objectively considered is unnecessary and from the subjective side is not known−− this insight has recently given rise to the thought that philosophy can only begin with a hypothetical andproblematical truth and therefore philosophising can at first be only a quest. This view was much stressed byReinhold in his later philosophical work and one must give it credit for the genuine interest on which it isbased, an interest which concerns the speculative nature of the philosophical beginning. The detaileddiscussion of this view is at the same time an occasion for introducing a preliminary understanding of themeaning of progress in logic generally; for that view has a direct bearing on the advance; this it conceives tobe such that progress in philosophy is rather a retrogression and a grounding or establishing by means ofwhich we first obtain the result that what we began with is not something merely arbitrarily assumed but is infact the truth, and also the primary truth. § 102 It must be admitted that it is an important consideration −− one which will be found in more detail in thelogic itself −− that the advance is a retreat into the ground, to what is primary and true, on which dependsand, in fact, from which originates, that with which the beginning is made. Thus consciousness on its onwardpath from the immediacy with which it began is led back to absolute knowledge as its innermost truth. Thislast, the ground, is then also that from which the first proceeds, that which at first appeared as an immediacy.This is true in still greater measure of absolute spirit which reveals itself as the concrete and final supremetruth of all being, and which at the end of the development is known as freely externalising itself, abandoningitself to the shape of an immediate being −−opening or unfolding itself [sich entschliessend] into the creationof a world which contains all that fell into the development which preceded that result and which through thisreversal of its position relatively to its beginning is transformed into something dependent on the result asprinciple. The essential requirement for the science of logic is not so much that the beginning be a pureimmediacy, but rather that the whole of the science be within itself a circle in which the first is also the lastand the last is also the first. § 103 We see therefore that, on the other hand, it is equally necessary to consider as result that into which themovement returns as into its ground. In this respect the first is equally the ground, and the last a derivative;since the movement starts from the first and by correct inferences arrives at the last as the ground, this latteris a result. Further, the progress from that which forms the beginning is to be regarded as only a furtherdetermination of it, hence that which forms the starting point of the development remains at the base of allthat follows and does not vanish from it. The progress does not consist merely in the derivation of an other, orin the effected transition into a genuine other; and in so far as this transition does occur it is equally sublatedagain. Thus the beginning of philosophy is the foundation which is present and preserved throughout theentire subsequent development, remaining completely immanent in its further determinations. § 104 Through this progress, then, the beginning loses the one−sidedness which attaches to it as something simplyimmediate and abstract; it becomes something mediated, and hence the line of the scientific advance becomesa circle. It also follows that because that which forms the beginning is still undeveloped, devoid of content, itis not truly known in the beginning; it is the science of logic in its whole compass which first constitutes thecompleted knowledge of it with its developed content and first truly grounds that knowledge. Science of LogicWith What must Science Begin?29"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"§ 105 But because it is the result which appears as the absolute ground, this progress in knowing is not somethingprovisional, or problematical and hypothetical; it must be determined by the nature of the subject matter itselfand its content. § 106 The said beginning is neither an arbitrary and merely provisional assumption, nor is it something whichappears to be arbitrarily and tentatively presupposed, but which is subsequently shown to have been properlymade the beginning; not as is the case with the constructions one is directed to make in connection with theproof of a theorem in geometry, where it becomes apparent only afterwards in the proof that one took theright course in drawing just those lines and then, in the proof itself, in beginning with the comparison of thoselines or angles; drawing such lines and comparing them are not an essential part of the proof itself. § 107 Thus the ground, the reason, why the beginning is made with pure being in the pure science [of logic] isdirectly given in the science itself. This pure being is the unity into which pure knowing withdraws, or, if thisitself is still to be distinguished as form from its unity, then being is also the content of pure knowing. It iswhen taken in this way that this pure being, this absolute immediacy has equally the character of somethingabsolutely mediated. But it is equally essential that it be taken only in the one−sided character in which it ispure immediacy, precisely because here it is the beginning. If it were not this pure indeterminateness, if itwere determinate, it would have been taken as something mediated, something already carried a stage further:what is determinate implies an other to a first. Therefore, it lies in the very nature of a beginning that it mustbe being and nothing else. To enter into philosophy, therefore, calls for no other preparations, no furtherreflections or points of connection. § 108 We cannot really extract any further determination or positive content for the beginning from the fact that it isthe beginning of philosophy. For here at the start, where the subject matter itself is not yet to hand,philosophy is an empty word or some assumed, unjustified conception. Pure knowing yields only thisnegative determination, that the beginning is to be abstract. If pure being is taken as the content of pureknowing, then the latter must stand back from its content, allowing it to have free play and not determining itfurther. Or again, if pure being is to be considered as the unity into which knowing has collapsed at theextreme point of its union with the object, then knowing itself has vanished in that unity, leaving behind nodifference from the unity and hence nothing by which the latter could be determined. Nor is there anythingelse present, any content which could be used to make the beginning more determinate. § 109 But the determination of being so far adopted for the beginning could also be omitted, so that the onlydemand would be that a pure beginning be made. In that case, we have nothing but the beginning itself, and itremains to be seen what this is. This position could also be suggested for the benefit of those who, on the onehand, are dissatisfied for one reason or another with the beginning with being and still more so with theresulting transition of being into nothing, and, on the other hand, simply know no other way of beginning ascience than by presupposing some general idea, which is then analysed, the result of such analysis yieldingthe first specific concept in the science. If we too were to observe this method, then we should be without aparticular object, because the beginning, as the beginning of thought, is supposed to be quite abstract, quitegeneral, wholly form without any content; thus we should have nothing at all beyond the general idea of a Science of LogicWith What must Science Begin?30"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"mere beginning as such. We have therefore only to see what is contained in such an idea. § 110 As yet there is nothing and there is to become something the beginning is not pure nothing, but a nothingfrom which something is to proceed; therefore being, too, is already contained in the beginning. Thebeginning therefore contains both, being and nothing, is the unity of being and nothing; or is non−beingwhich is at the same time being, and being which is at the same time non−being. § 111 Further, in the beginning, being and nothing are present as distinguished from each other; for the beginningpoints to something else −− it is a non−being which carries a reference to being as to an other; that whichbegins, as yet is not, it is only on the way to being. That which begins, as yet is not, it is only on the way to being. The being contained in the beginning is,therefore, a being which removed itself from non−being or sublates it as something opposed to it. But again, that which begins already is, but equally, too, is not as yet. The opposites, being and non−beingare therefore directly united in it, or, otherwise expressed, it is their undifferentiated unity. § 112 The analysis of the beginning would thus yield the notion of the unity of being and nothing −− or, in a morereflected form, the unity of differentiatedness and non−differentiatedness, or the identity of identity andnon−identity. This concept could be regarded as the first, purest, that is, most abstract definition of theabsolute −− as it would in fact be if we were at all concerned with the form of definitions and with the nameof the absolute. In this sense, that abstract concept would be the first definition of this absolute and all furtherdeterminations and developments only more specific and richer definitions of it. But let those who aredissatisfied with being as a beginning because it passes over into nothing and so gives rise to the unity ofbeing and nothing, let them see whether they find this beginning which begins with the general idea of abeginning and with its analysis (which, though of course correct, likewise leads to the unity of being andnothing), more satisfactory than the beginning with being. § 113 But there is a still further observation to be made about this procedure. The said analysis presupposes asfamiliar the idea of a beginning, thus following the example of other sciences. These presuppose theirsubject−matter and take it for granted that everyone has roughly the same general idea of it and can find in itthe same determinations as those indicated by the sciences which have obtained them in one way or anotherthrough analysis, comparison and other kinds of reasoning. But that which forms the absolute beginning mustlikewise be something otherwise known; now if it is something concrete and hence is variously determinedwithin itself, then this internal relation is presupposed as something known; it is thus put forward as animmediacy which, however, it is not; for it is a relation only as a relation of distinct moments, and it thereforecontains mediation within itself. Further, with a concrete object, the analysis and the ways in which it isdetermined are affected by contingency and arbitrariness. Which determinations are brought out depends onwhat each person just finds in his own immediate, contingent idea. The relation contained in somethingconcrete, in a synthetic unity, is necessary only in so far as it is not just given but is produced by thespontaneous return of the moments back into this unity −− a movement which is the opposite of the analyticalprocedure, which is an activity belonging to the subject−thinker and external to the subject matter itself. Science of LogicWith What must Science Begin?31"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"§ 114 The foregoing shows quite clearly the reason why the beginning cannot be made with anything concrete,anything containing a relation within itself. For such presupposes an internal process of mediation andtransition of which the concrete, now become simple, would be the result. But the beginning ought not itselfto be already a first and an other; for anything which is in its own self a first and an other implies that anadvance has already been made. Consequently, that which constitutes the beginning, the beginning itself, is tobe taken as something unanalysable, taken in its simple, unfilled immediacy, and therefore as being, as thecompletely empty being. § 115 If impatience with the consideration of the abstract beginning should provoke anyone to say that thebeginning should be made not with the beginning, but straightway with the subject matter itself, well then,this subject matter is nothing else but the said empty being; for what this subject matter is, that will beexplicated only in the development of the science and cannot be presupposed by it as known beforehand. § 116 Whatever other form the beginning takes in the attempt to begin with something other than empty being, itwill suffer from the defects already specified. Let those who are still dissatisfied with this beginning tacklethe problem of avoiding these defects by beginning in some other way. § 117 But we cannot leave entirely unmentioned an original beginning of philosophy which has recently becomefamous, the beginning with the ego. It came partly from the reflection that from the first truth the entiresequel must be derived, and partly from the requirement that the first truth must be something with which weare acquainted, and still more, something of which we are immediately certain. This beginning is, in general,not a contingent idea which can be differently constituted in different subjects. For the ego, this immediateconsciousness of self, at first appears to be itself both an immediacy and also something much more familiarto us than any other idea; anything else known belongs to the ego, it is true, but is still a content distinguishedfrom it and therefore contingent; the ego, on the contrary, is the simple certainty of its own self. § 118 But the ego as such is at the same time also concrete, or rather, the ego is the most concrete of all things −−the consciousness of itself as an infinitely manifold world. Before the ego, this concrete Being, can be madethe beginning and ground of philosophy, it must be disrupted −− this is the absolute act through which theego purges itself of its content and becomes aware of itself as an abstract ego. Only this pure ego now is notimmediate, is not the familiar, ordinary ego of our consciousness to which the science of logic could bedirectly linked for everyone. That act, strictly speaking, would be nothing else but the elevation to thestandpoint of pure knowing where the distinction of subject and object has vanished. But as thus immediatelydemanded, this elevation is a subjective postulate; to prove itself a genuine demand, the progression of theconcrete ego from immediate consciousness to pure knowing must have been indicated and exhibited throughthe necessity of the ego itself. Without this objective movement pure knowing, even in the shape ofintellectual intuition, appears as an arbitrary standpoint, or even as one of the empirical states ofconsciousness with respect to which everything turns on whether or not it is found or can be produced in eachand every individual. But inasmuch as this pure ego must be essential, pure knowing, and pure knowing isnot immediately present in the individual consciousness but only as posited through the absolute act of theego in raising itself to that stand−point, we lose the very advantage which is supposed to come from this Science of LogicWith What must Science Begin?32"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"beginning of philosophy namely that it is something thoroughly familiar, something 'everyone finds inhimself which can form the starting point for further reflection; that pure ego, on the contrary, in its abstract,essential nature, is something unknown to the ordinary consciousness, something it does not find therein.Instead, such a beginning brings with it the disadvantage of the illusion that whereas the thing underdiscussion is supposed to be something familiar, the ego of empirical self−consciousness, it is in factsomething far removed from it. When pure knowing is characterised as ego, it acts as a perpetual reminder ofthe subjective ego whose limitations should be forgotten, and it fosters the idea that the propositions andrelations resulting from the further development of the ego are present and can already be found in theordinary consciousness −− for in fact it is this of which they are asserted. This confusion, far from clarifyingthe problem of a beginning, only adds to the difficulties involved and tends completely to mislead; among−the uninitiated it has given rise to the crudest misunderstandings. § 119 Further, as regards the subjective determinateness of the ego in general, it is true that pure knowing frees theego from the restricted meaning imposed on it by the insuperable opposition of its object; but for this reasonit would be superfluous at least to retain this subjective attitude and the determination of pure knowing asego. This determination, however, not only introduces the disturbing ambiguity mentioned, but closelyexamined it also remains a subjective ego. The actual development of the science which starts from the egoshows that in that development the object has and retains the perennial character of an other for the ego, andthat the ego which formed the starting point is, therefore, still entangled in the world of appearance and is notthe pure knowing which has in truth overcome the opposition of consciousness. § 120 In this connection a further essential observation must be made, namely that although the ego could in itselfor in principle [an sich] be characterised as pure knowing or as intellectual intuition and asserted as thebeginning, we are not concerned in the science of logic with what is present only in principle or as somethinginner, but rather with the determinate reality in thought of what is inner and with the determinatenesspossessed by such an inner in this reality. But what, at the beginning of the science, is actually present ofintellectual intuition−or of the eternal, the divine, the absolute, if its object be so named−cannot be anythingelse than a first, immediate, simple determination. Whatever richer name be given to it than is expressed bymere being, the consideration of such absolute must be restricted solely to the way in which it enters into ourknowing as thought and is enunciated as such. True, intellectual intuition is the forcible rejection ofmediation and the ratiocinative, external reflection; but what it enunciates above and beyond simpleimmediacy is something concrete, something which contains within itself diverse determinations. However,as we have remarked, the enunciation and exposition of such concrete beginning is a process of mediationwhich starts from one of the determinations and advances to the other, even though the latter returns to thefirst; it is a movement which at the same time may not be arbitrary or assertoric. Consequently, it is not theconcrete something itself with which that exposition begins but only the simple immediacy from which themovement starts. And further, if something concrete is taken as the beginning, the conjunction of thedeterminations contained in it demand proof, and this is lacking. § 121 If, therefore, in the expression of the absolute, or eternal, or God (and God has the absolutely undisputed rightthat the beginning be made with him) −− if in the intuition or thought of these there is implied more than purebeing −− then this more must make its appearance in our knowing only as something thought, not assomething imagined or figurately conceived; let what is present in intuition or figurate conception be as richas it may, the determination which first emerges in knowing is simple, for only in what is simple is therenothing more than the pure beginning; only the immediate is simple, for only in the immediate has no Science of LogicWith What must Science Begin?33"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"advance yet been made from a one to an other. Consequently, whatever is intended to be expressed or impliedbeyond being, in the richer forms of representing the absolute or God, this is in the beginning only an emptyword and only being; this simple determination which has no other meaning of any kind, this emptiness, istherefore simply as such the beginning of philosophy. § 122 This insight is itself so simple that this beginning as such requires no preparation or further introduction; and,indeed, these preliminary, external reflections about it were not so much intended to lead up to it as rather toeliminate all preliminaries. General Division of Being § 123 Being is determined, first, as against another in general; Secondly, as immanently self−determining; Thirdly,setting aside the preliminary character of this division, it is the abstract indeterminateness and immediacy inwhich it must be the beginning. § 124 According to the first determination, being is classified as distinct from essence, for later in its development itproves to be in its totality only one sphere of the Notion and to this sphere as moment, it opposes anothersphere. § 125 According to the second determination, it is the sphere within which fall the determinations and the entiremovement of its reflection. Here, being will posit itself in three determinations: I as determinateness as such: qualityII as sublated determinateness: magnitude, quantityIII as qualitatively determined quantity: measure.§ 126 At this stage, this division is, as was remarked of these divisions generally in the Introduction, a preliminarystatement; its determinations have first to arise from the movement of being itself and in so doing define andjustify themselves. As regards the divergence of this classification from the usual presentation of thecategories, namely, as quantity, quality, relation and modality −− these moreover with Kant are supposed tobe only titles for his categories though they are, in fact, themselves categories, only more general ones −− thiscalls for no special comment here, as the entire exposition will show a complete divergence from the usualarrangement and significance of the categories. § 127 This only perhaps can be remarked, that hitherto the determination of quantity has been made to precedequality and this as is mostly the case −− for no given reason. It has already been shown that the beginning ismade with being as such, therefore, with qualitative being. It is easily seen from a comparison of quality withquantity that the former by its nature is first. For quantity is quality which has already become negative;magnitude is the determinateness which is no longer one with being but is already differentiated from it, Science of LogicWith What must Science Begin?34"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"sublated quality which has become indifferent. It includes the alterableness of being, although the categoryitself, namely Being, of which it is the detrermination, is not altered by it. The qualitative determinateness, onthe other hand, is one with its being: it neither goes beyond it nor is internal to it, but is its immediatelimitedness. Quality therefore, as the immediate determinateness, is primary and it is with it that thebeginning must be made. § 128 Measure is a relation, but not relation in general, for it is the specific relation between quality and quantity;the categories which Kant includes under relation will come up for consideration in quite another place.Measure can also, if one wishes, be regarded as a modality; but since with Kant modality is supposed nolonger to constitute a determination of the content, but to concern only the relation of the content to thought,to the subjective element, it is a quite heterogeneous relation and is not pertinent here. § 129 The third determiantion of being falls within the section Quality, for as abstract immediacy it reduces itself toa single determinateness in relation to its other determinatenesses within its sphere. Quality − Quantity − MeasureSection One: Determinateness (Quality)§ 130 Being is the indeterminate immediate; it is free from determinateness in relation to essence and also from anywhich it can possess within itself. This reflectionless being is being as it is immediately in its own self alone. § 131 Because it is indeterminate being, it lacks all quality; but in itself, the character of indeterminateness attachesto it only in contrast to what is determinate or qualitative. But determinate being stands in contrast to being ingeneral, so that the very indeterminateness of the latter constitutes its quality. It will therefore be shown thatthe first being is in itself determinate, and therefore, secondly, that it passes over into determinate being −− isdeterminate being −− but that this latter as finite being sublates itself and passes over into the infinite relationof being to its own self, that is, thirdly, into being−for−self. Chapter 1 BeingA Being § 132 Being, pure being, without any further determination. In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself.It is also not unequal relatively to an other; it has no diversity within itself nor any with a reference outwards.It would not be held fast in its purity if it contained any determination or content which could bedistinguished in it or by which it could be distinguished from an other. It is pure indeterminateness andemptiness. There is nothing to be intuited in it, if one can speak here of intuiting; or, it is only this pureintuiting itself. Just as little is anything to be thought in it, or it is equally only this empty thinking. Being, theindeterminate immediate, is in fact nothing, and neither more nor less than nothing.

In so far as intuiting or thinking can be mentioned here, it counts asa distinction whether something or nothing is intuited or thought. To intuit or think nothing has, therefore, ameaning; both are distinguished and thus nothing is (exists) in our intuiting or thinking; or rather it is emptyintuition and thought itself, and the same empty intuition or thought as pure being. Nothing is, therefore, thesame determination, or rather absence of determination, and thus altogether the same as, pure being. C Becoming 1. Unity of Being and Nothing § 134 Pure Being and pure nothing are, therefore, the same. What is the truth is neither being nor nothing, but thatbeing −− does not pass over but has passed over −− into nothing, and nothing into being. But it is equally truethat they are not undistinguished from each other, that, on the contrary, they are not the same, that they areabsolutely distinct, and yet that they are unseparated and inseparable and that each each immediately vanishesin its opposite. Their truth is therefore, this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other:becoming, a movement in which both are distinguished, but by a difference which has equally immediatelyresolved itself.

The Sublation of Becoming Remark: TheExpression ‘To Sublate’ § 184 To sublate, and the sublated (that which exists ideally as a moment), constitute one of the most importantnotions in philosophy. It is a fundamental determination which repeatedly occurs throughout the whole ofphilosophy, the meaning of which is to be clearly grasped and especially distinguished from nothing. What issublated is not thereby reduced to nothing. Nothing is immediate; what is sublated, on the other hand, is theresult of mediation; it is a non−being but as a result which had its origin in a being. It still has, therefore, initself the determinate from which it originates. § 185 'To sublate' has a twofold meaning in the language: on the one hand it means to preserve, to maintain, andequally it also means to cause to cease, to put an end to. Even 'to preserve' includes a negative elements,namely, that something is removed from its influences, in order to preserve it. Thus what is sublated is at thesame time preserved; it has only lost its immediacy but is not on that account annihilated. Science of LogicQuality − Quantity − Measure36"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"§ 186 The two definitions of 'to sublate' which we have given can be quoted as two dictionary meanings of thisword. But it is certainly remarkable to find that a language has come to use one and the same word for twoopposite meanings. It is a delight to speculative thought to find in the language words which have inthemselves a speculative meaning; the German language has a number of such. The double meaning of theLatin tollere (which has become famous through the Ciceronian pun: tollendum est Octavium) does not go sofar; its affirmative determination signifies only a lifting−up. Something is sublated only in so far as it hasentered into unity with its opposite; in this more particular signification as something reflected, it mayfittingly be called a moment. In the case of the lever, weight and distance from a point are called itsmechanical moments on account of the sameness of their effect, in spite of the contrast otherwise betweensomething real, such as a weight, and something ideal, such as a mere spatial determination, a line.' We shalloften have occasion to notice that the technical language of philosophy employs Latin terms for reflecteddeterminations, either because the mother tongue has no words for them or if it has, as here, because itsexpression calls to mind more what is immediate, whereas the foreign language suggests more what isreflected. § 187 The more precise meaning and expression which being and nothing receive, now that they are moments, is tobe ascertained from the consideration of determinate being as the unity in which they are preserved. Being isbeing, and nothing is nothing, only in their contradistinction from each other; but in their truth, in their unity,they have vanished as these determinations and are now something else. Being and nothing are the same; butjust because they are the same they are no longer being and nothing, but now have a different significance. Inbecoming they were coming−to−be and ceasing−to−be; in determinate being, a differently determined unity,they are again differently determined moments. This unity now remains their base from which they do notagain emerge in the abstract significance of being and nothing. Chapter 2 Determinate Being§ 188 In considering determinate being the emphasis falls on its determinate character; the determinateness is in theform of being, and as such it is quality. Through its quality, something is determined as opposed to an other,as alterable and finite; and as negatively determined not only against an other but also in its own self. This itsnegation as at first opposed to the finite something is the infinite; the abstract opposition in which thesedeterminations appear resolves itself into the infinity which is free from the opposition, into being−for−self. § 189 The treatment of determinate being falls therefore into three parts: A.

For the ought implies that one is superior to the limitation; in it the limit is sublated and thein−itself of the ought is thus an identical self−relation, and hence the abstraction of 'can'. But conversely, it isequally correct that: 'you cannot, just because you ought.' For in the ought, the limitation as limitation isequally implied; the said formalism of possibility has, in the limitation, a reality, a qualitative othernessopposed to it and the relation of each to the other is a contradiction, and thus a 'cannot', or rather animpossibility. § 264 In the Ought the transcendence of finitude, that is, infinity, begins. The ought is that which, in the furtherdevelopment, exhibits itself in accordance with the said impossibility as the infinity. § 265 With respect to the form of the limitation and the ought, two prejudices can be criticised in more detail. Firstof all, great stress is laid on the limitations of thought, of reason, and so on, and it is asserted that thelimitation cannot be transcended. To make such as assertion is to be unaware that the very fact that somethingis determined as a limitation implies that the limitation is already transcended. For a determinateness, a limit,is determined as a limitation only in opposition to its other in general, that is, in opposition to that which isfree from the limitation; the other of a limitation is precisely the being beyond it. Stone and metal do nottranscend their limitation because this is not a limitation for them. If, however, in the case of such generalpropositions framed by the understanding, such as that limitation cannot be transcended, thought will notapply itself to finding out what is implied in the Notion, then it can be directed to the world of actuality wheresuch proportions show themselves to be completely unreal. just because thought is supposed to be superior toactuality, to dwell apart from it in higher regions and therefore to be itself determined as an ought−to−be, onthe one hand, it does not advance to the Notion, and, on the other hand, it stands in just as untrue a relation toactuality as it does to the Notion. Because the stone does not think, does not even feel, its limitedness is not a limitation for it, that is, is not anegation in it for sensation, imagination, thought, etc., which it does not possess. But even the stone, as asomething, contains the distinction of its determination or in−itself and its determinate being, and to thatextent it, too, transcends its limitation; the Notion which is implicit in it contains the identity of the stone withits other. If it is a base capable of being acted on by an acid, then it can be oxidised, and neutralised, and soon. In oxidation, neutralisation and so on, it overcomes its limitation of existing only as a base; it transcendsit, and similarly the acid overcomes its limitation of being an acid. This ought, the obligation to transcend Science of LogicChapter 2 Determinate Being38"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"limitations, is present in both acid and caustic base in such a degree that it is only by force that they can bekept fixed as (waterless, that is, purely non−neutral) acid and caustic base. § 266 If, however, an existence contains the Notion not merely as an abstract in−itself, but as an explicit,self−determined totality, as instinct, life, ideation, etc., then in its own strength it overcomes the limitationand attains a being beyond it. The plant transcends the limitation of being a seed, similarly, of being blossom,fruit, leaf; the seed becomes the developed plant, the blossom fades away, and so on. The sentient creature, inthe limitation of hunger, thirst, etc., is the urge to overcome this limitation and it does overcome it. It feelspain, and it is the privilege of the sentient nature to feel pain; it is a negation in its self, and the negation isdetermined as a limitation in its feeling, just because the sentient creature has the feeling of its self, which isthe totality that transcends this determinateness. If it were not above and beyond the determinateness, itwould not feel it as its negation and would feel no pain. But it is reason, thought, which is supposed to be unable to transcend limitation −− reason, which is theuniversal explicitly beyond particularity as such (that is, all particularity), which is nothing but theovercoming of limitation! Granted, not every instance of transcending and being beyond limitation is agenuine liberation from it, a veritable affirmation; even the ought itself, and abstraction in general, is inimperfect transcending. However, the reference to the wholly abstract universal is a sufficient reply to theequally abstract assertion that limitation cannot be transcended, or, again, even the reference to the infinite ingeneral is a sufficient refutation of the assertion that the finite cannot be transcended. § 267 In this connection we may mention a seemingly ingenious fancy of Leibniz: that if a magnet possessedconsciousness it would regard its pointing to the north as a determination of its will, as a law of its freedom.On the contrary, if it possessed consciousness and consequently will and freedom, it would be a thinkingbeing. Consequently, space for it would be universal, embracing every direction, so that the single directionto the north would be rather a limitation on its freedom, just as much as being fixed to one spot would be alimitation for a man although not for a plant. § 268 On the other hand, the ought is the transcending, but still only finite transcending, of the limitation.Therefore, it has its place and its validity in the sphere of finitude where it holds fast to being−in−itself inopposition to limitedness, declaring the former to be the regulative and essential factor relatively to what isnull. Duty is an ought directed against the particular will, against self−seeking desire and capricious interestand it is held up as an ought to the will in so far as this has the capacity to isolate itself from the true. Thosewho attach such importance to the ought of morality and fancy that morality is destroyed if the ought is notrecognized as ultimate truth, and those too who, reasoning from the level of the understanding, derive aperpetual satisfaction from being able to confront everything there is with an ought, that is, with a 'knowingbetter' −− and for that very reason are just as loath to be robbed of the ought −− do not see that as regards thefinitude of their sphere the ought receives full recognition. But in the world of actuality itself, Reason andLaw are not in such a bad way that they only ought to be −− it is only the abstraction of the in−itself thatstops at this−any more than the ought is in its own self perennial and, what is the same thing, that finitude isabsolute. The philosophy of Kant and Fichte sets up the ought as the highest point of the resolution of thecontradictions of Reason; but the truth is that the ought is only the standpoint which clings to finitude andthus to contradiction.

The idealism of philosophy consists innothing else than in recognising that the finite has no veritable being. Every philosophy is essentially anidealism or at least has idealism for its principle, and the question then is only how far this principle isactually carried out. This is as true of philosophy as of religion; for religion equally does not recognisefinitude as a veritable being, as something ultimate and absolute or as something underived, uncreated,eternal. Consequently the opposition of idealistic and realistic philosophy has no significance. A philosophywhich ascribed veritable, ultimate, absolute being to finite existence as such, would not deserve the name ofphilosophy; the principles of ancient or modern philosophies, water, or matter, or atoms are thoughts,universals, ideal entities, not things as they immediately present themselves to us, that is, in their sensuousindividuality −− not even the water of Thales. For although this is also empirical water, it is at the same timealso the in−itself or essence of all other things, too, and these other things are not self−subsistent or groundedin themselves, but are posited by, are derived from, an other, from water, that is they are ideal entities. Nowabove we have named the principle or the universal the ideal (and still more must the Notion, the Idea, spiritbe so named); and then again we have described individual, sensuous things as ideal in principle, or in theirNotion, still more in spirit, that is, as sublated; here we must note, in passing, this twofold aspect whichshowed itself in connection with the infinite, namely that on the one hand the ideal is concrete, veritablebeing, and on the other hand the moments of this concrete being are no less ideal −− are sublated in it; but infact what is, is only the one concrete whole from which the moments are inseparable. § 317 By the ideal [dem Ideellen] is meant chiefly the form of figurate conception and imagination, and what issimply in my conception, or in the Notion, or in the idea, in imagination, and so on, is called ideal, so thateven fancies are counted as ideals −− conceptions which are not only distinct from the real world, but aresupposed to be essentially not real. In point of fact, the spirit is the idealist proper; in spirit, even as feeling,imagination and still more as thinking and comprehending, the content is not present as a so−called realexistence; in the simplicity of the ego such external being is present only as sublated, it is for me, it is ideallyin me. This subjective idealism, either in the form of the unconscious idealism of consciousness generally, orconsciously enunciated and set up as a principle, concerns only the form of conception according to which acontent is mine; in the systematic idealism of subjectivity this form is declared to be the only true exclusiveform in opposition to the form of objectivity or reality, of the external existence of that content. Suchidealism is [merely] formal because it disregards the content of imagination or thought, which content inbeing imagined or thought can remain wholly in its finitude. In such an idealism nothing is lost, just as muchbecause the reality of such a finite content, the existence filled with finitude, is preserved, as because, in sofar as abstraction is made from such finite reality, the content is supposed to be of no consequence in itself;and in it nothing is gained for the same reason that nothing is lost, because the ego, conception, spirit,remains filled with the same content of finitude. The opposition of the form of subjectivity and objectivity isof course one of the finitudes; but the content, as taken up in sensation, intuition or even in the more abstractelement of conception, of thought, contains finitudes in abundance and with the exclusion of only one of themodes of finitude, namely, of the said form of subjective and objective, these finitudes are certainly noteliminated, still less have they spontaneously fallen away.

It thus contains,to begin with, only the first negation, which is itself immediate; it is true that being, too, is preserved in it andboth are united in determinate being in a simple unity, but for that very reason they are in themselves stillunequal to each other and their unity is not yet posited. Determinate being is therefore the sphere ofdifference, of dualism, the field of finitude. Determinateness is determinateness as such, in which being isonly relatively, not absolutely determined. In being−for−self, the difference between being anddeterminateness or negation is posited and equalised; quality, otherness, limit −− like reality, being−in−itself,the ought, and so on−are the imperfect embodiments of the negation in being in which the difference of bothstill lies at the base. Since, however, in finitude the negation has passed into infinity, into the posited negationof negation, it is simple self−relation and consequently in its own self the equalisation with being, absolutelydetermined being. § 319 Being−for−self is first, immediately a being−for−self −− the One. Secondly, the One passes into a plurality of ones −− repulsion −− and this otherness of the ones is sublated intheir ideality −− attraction. Thirdly, we have the alternating determination of repulsion and attraction in which they collapse intoequilibrium, and quality, which in being−for−self reached its climax, passes over into quantity.

This determination of them and −− therelationships connected with it have to be compared with the Notions which have resulted from our Science of LogicChapter 3 Being−for−self41"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"consideration of them. Conceived as forces, they are regarded as self−subsistent and therefore as notconnected with each other through their own nature; that is, they are considered not as moments, each ofwhich is supposed to pass into the other, but rather as fixed in their opposition to each other. Further, they areimagined as meeting in a third, in matter, but in such a manner, that this unification is, counted, as their truth.,on the contrary; each is regarded also as a first, as being in and for itself, and matter, or its determinations, aresupposed to be realised and produced by them. When it is said that matter has the forces within itself, they areunderstood to be so conjoined in this unity that they are at the same time presupposed as intrinsically free andindependent of each other. § 374 Kant, as we know, constructed matter from the forces of attraction and repulsion, or at least he has, to use hisown words, set up the metaphysical elements of this construction. It will not be without interest to examinethis construction more closely. This metaphysical exposition of a subject matter which not only itself but alsoin its determinations seemed to belong only to experience is noteworthy, partly because as an experimentwith the Notion it at least gave the impulse to the more recent philosophy of nature, to a philosophy whichdoes not make nature as given in sense−perception the basis of science, but which goes to the absolute Notionfor its determinations; and partly because in many cases no advance is made beyond the Kantian constructionwhich is held to be a philosophical beginning and foundation for physics. § 375 Now it is true that matter as it exists for sense perception is no more a subject matter of logic than are spaceand its determinations. But the forces of attraction and repulsion, in so far as they are regarded as forces ofempirical matter, are also based on the pure determinations here considered of the one and the many and theirinter−relationships, which, because these names are most obvious, I have called repulsion and attraction. § 376 Kant's method in the deduction of matter from these forces, which he calls a construction, when looked atmore closely does not deserve this name, unless any exercise of reflection, even analytical reflection, is to becalled a construction; and later philosophers of nature have in fact given the name of construction to theshallowest reasoning and the most baseless concoction of unbridled imagination and thoughtless reflection−− and it is especially for the so−called factors of attraction and repulsion that such philosophers have showna predilection. § 377 For Kant's method is basically analytical, not constructive. He presupposes the idea of matter and then askswhat forces are required to maintain the determinations he has presupposed. Thus, on the one hand, hedemands the force of attraction because, properly speaking, through repulsion alone and without attractionmatter could not exist; and on the other hand he derives repulsion, too, from matter and gives as the reasonthat we think of matter as impenetrable, since it presents itself under this category to the sense of touch bywhich it manifests itself to us. Consequently, he proceeds, repulsion is at once thought in the concept ofmatter because it is immediately given therein, whereas attraction is added to the concept syllogistically. Butthese syllogisms, too, are based on what has just been said, namely, that matter which possessed repulsiveforce alone, would not exhaust our conception of matter. It is evident that this is the method of a cognition which reflects on experience, which first perceives thedeterminations in a phenomenon, then makes these the fondation, and for their so−called explanation assumescorresponding basic elements or forces which are suppoed to produce those determinations of the Science of LogicChapter 3 Being−for−self42"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"phenomenon. § 378 With respect to this difference as to the way in which cognition finds the forces of repulsion and attraction inmatter, Kant further remarks that the force of attraction certainly just as much belongs to the concept ofmatter 'although it is not contained in it'; this last expression is italicised by Kant. However, it is hard toperceive what this difference is supposed to be; for a determination which belongs to the concept of anythingmust be truly contained in it. § 379 What causes the difficulty and gives rise to this vain subterfuge, is that Kant from the start one−sidedlyattributes to the concept of matter only the determination of impenetrability, which we are supposed toperceive by the sense of touch, for which reason the force of repulsion as the holding off of an other fromitself is immediately given. But if, further, the existence of matter is supposed to be impossible withoutattraction, then this assertion is based on a conception of matter taken from sense perception; consequently,the determination of attraction, too, must come within the range of sense perception. It is indeed easy toperceive that matter, besides its being−for−self, which sublates the being−for−other (offers resistance), hasalso a relation between its self−determined parts, a spatial extension and cohesion, and in rigidity and soliditythe cohesion is very firm. Physics explains that the tearing apart, etc., of a body requires a force which shallbe stronger than the mutual attraction of the parts of the body. From this observation reflection can just asdirectly derive the force of attraction or assume it as given, as it did with the force of repulsion. In point offact, if we consider Kant's arguments from which the force of attraction is supposed to be deduced (the proofof the proposition that the possibility of matter requires a force of attraction as a second fundamental force,loc. cit.), it is apparent that their sole content is this, that through repulsion alone matter would not be spatialMatter being presupposed as filling space, it is credited with continuity, the ground of which is assumed to bethe force of attraction. § 380 Now if the merit of such a construction of matter were at most that of an analysis (though a merit diminishedby the faulty exposition), still the fundamental thought, namely, the derivation of matter from these twoopposite determinations as its fundamental forces, must always be highly esteemed. Kant is chiefly concernedto banish the vulgar mechanistic way of thinking which stops short at the one determination ofimpenetrability, of self−determined and self−subsistent puncticity, and converts into something external theopposite determination, the relation of matter within itself or the relation of a plurality of matters, which inturn are regarded as particular ones −− a way of thinking which, as Kant says, will admit no motive forcesexcept pressure and thrust, that is, only action from without. This external manner of thinking alwayspresupposes motion as already externally present in matter, and it does not occur to it to regard motion assomething immanent and to comprehend motion itself in matter, which latter is thus assumed as, on its ownaccount, motionless and inert. This stand−point has before it only ordinary mechanics, not immanent and freemotion. It is true that Kant sublates this externality in so far as he makes attraction (the relation of matters toone another in so far as these are assumed as separated from one another, or matter generally in itsself−externality) a force of matter itself; still, on the other hand, his two fundamental forces within matterremain external to and completely independent of each other. § 381 The fixed difference of these two forces attributed to them from that external standpoint is no less null thanany other distinction must show itself to be which, in respect of its specific content, is made into something Science of LogicChapter 3 Being−for−self43"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"supposedly fixed; because these forces are only moments which pass over into each other, as we saw abovewhen they were considered in their truth. I go on to consider these other distinctions as they are stated byKant. § 382 He defines the force of attraction as a penetrative force by which one bit of matter can act directly on theparts of another even beyond the area of contact; the force of repulsion, on the other hand, he defines as asurface force through which bits of matter can act on each other only in the common area of contact. Thereason adduced that the latter can be only a surface force is as follows: ‘The parts in contact each limit thesphere of action of the other, and the force of repulsion cannot move any more distant part except through theagency of the intervening parts; an immediate action of one part of matter on another passing right acrossthese intervening parts by forces of expansion (which means here, forces of repulsion) is impossible.’ § 383 But here we must remember that in assuming 'nearer' or 'more distant' parts of matter, the same distinctionwould likewise arise with respect to attraction, namely, that though one atom acted on another, yet a third,more distant atom (between which and the first atom, the second atom would be), would first enter into thesphere of attraction of the intervening atom nearer to it; therefore the first atom would not have an immediate,simple action on the third, from which it would follow that the action of the force of attraction, like that ofrepulsion, is equally mediated. Further, the genuine penetration of the force of attraction could of necessityconsist only in this, that every part of matter was in and for itself attractive, not that a certain number ofatoms behaved passively and only one atom actively. But we must at once remark with respect to the force ofrepulsion itself that in the passage quoted, 'parts in contact' are mentioned which implies solidity andcontinuity of a matter already finished and complete which would not permit the passage through it of arepelling force. But this solidity of matter in which parts are in contact and are no longer separated by thevoid already presupposes that the force of repulsion is sublated; according to the sensuous conception ofrepulsion which prevails here, parts in contact are to be taken as those which do not repel each other. Ittherefore follows, quite tautologically, that where repulsion is assumed to be not, there no repulsion can takeplace. But from this nothing else follows which could serve to determine the force of repulsion. However,reflection on the statement that parts in contact are in contact only in so far as they hold themselves apart,leads directly to the conclusion that the force of repulsion is not merely on the surface of matter but withinthe sphere which was supposed to be only a sphere of attraction. § 384 Kant assumes further that 'through the force of attraction, matter only occupies space but does not fill it'; and'because matter through the force of attraction does not fill space, this force can act across empty space sincethere is no intervening matter to limit it'. This distinction is much the same as the one mentioned above wherea determination was supposed to belong to the concept of a thing but not to be contained in it; here, then,matter is supposed only to occupy a space but not to fill it. There it is repulsion, if we stop at the firstdetermination of matter, through which the ones repel one another and so are only negatively related to oneanother, here that means, by empty space. Here, however, it is the force of attraction which keeps spaceempty; it does not fill space by its connection of the atoms, in other words, it keeps the atoms in a negativerelation to one another. We see that Kant here unconsciously realises what is implicit in the nature of thesubject matter, when he attributes to the force of attraction precisely what, in accordance with the firstdetermination, he attributed to the opposite force. While he was busy with establishing the difference betweenthe two forces, it happened that one had passed over into the other. Thus through repulsion, on the other hand,matter is supposed to fill a space, and consequently through repulsion the empty space left by the force ofattraction vanishes. In point of fact repulsion, in doing away with empty space, also destroys the negative Science of LogicChapter 3 Being−for−self44"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"relation of the atoms or ones, that is, their repulsion of one another; in −other words, repulsion is determinedas the opposite of itself. § 385 To this effacing of the differences there is added the confusion arising from the fact that, as we observed atthe beginning, Kant's exposition of the opposed forces is analytic; and whereas matter is supposed to bederived from its elements, it is presented throughout the entire discourse as already formed and constituted. Inthe definition of surface and penetrative force both are assumed as motive forces by means of which matter issupposed to be able to act in one or other of these ways. Here, therefore, they are represented as forces, notthrough which matter first comes into being but through which matter, as an already finished product, is onlyset in motion. But in so far as we are speaking of the forces through which different bodies act on one anotherand are set in motion, this is something quite different from the determination and relation which these forceswere supposed to have as [constitutive] moments of matter. § 386 The same opposition of attractive and repulsive forces is made by their more developed form of centripetaland centrifugal forces. These appear to offer an essential distinction, since in their sphere there is a fixedsingle one, a centre, in relation to which the other ones behave as not for themselves, so that the differencebetween the forces can be linked to this presupposed difference between a single central one and the otherswhich are not independent relatively to it. But if they are to be used for explanation −− for which purposethey are assumed to be (like the forces of repulsion and attraction) in an inverse quantitative ratio so that theone increases as the other decreases −− then the phenomenon of the motion and its inequality ought to be theresult of these forces which were assumed for the purpose of explanation. However, one need only examinethe accounts (any of them will do) of a phenomenon like the unequal velocity of a planet in its orbit round thesun, based on the opposition of these forces, to become aware of the confusion which prevails in suchexplanations, and the impossibility of disentangling the magnitudes of the forces, so that the one which in theexplanation is assumed to be decreasing can just as well be assumed to be increasing, and vice versa. Tomake this evident would require a lengthier exposition than could be given here; but what is necessary forthis purpose is adduced later on in connection with the inverted relation. Section Two: Magnitude (Quantity)§ 387 The difference between quantity and quality has been stated. Quality is the first, immediate determinateness,quantity is the determinateness which has become indifferent to being, a limit which is just as much no limit,being−for−self which is absolutely identical with being−for−other −− a repulsion of the many ones which isdirectly the non−repulsion, the continuity of them. § 388 Because that which is for itself is now posited as not excluding its other, but rather as affirmativelycontinuing itself into it, it is otherness in so far as determinate being again appears in this continuity and itsdeterminateness is at the same time no longer in a simple self−relation, no longer an immediatedeterminateness of the determinately existent something, but is posited as self−repelling, as in fact having therelation−to−self as a determinateness in another something (which is for itself; and since they are at the sametime indifferent, relationless limits reflected into themselves, the determinateness in general is outside itself,an absolutely self−external determinateness and an equally external something; such a limit, the indifference Science of LogicSection Two: Magnitude (Quantity)45"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"of the limit within itself and of the something to the limit, constitutes the quantitative determinateness of thesomething. § 389 In the first place, pure quantity is to be distinguished from itself as a determinate quantity, from quantum. Asthe former, it is in the first place real being−for−self which has returned into itself and which as yet containsno determinateness: a compact, infinite unity which continues itself into itself. § 390 Secondly, this develops a determinateness which is posited in it as one which is at the same time nodeterminateness, as only an external one. It becomes quantum. Quantum is indifferent determinateness, thatis, a self−transcending, self−negating determinateness; as this otherness of otherness it relapses into theinfinite progress. But the infinite quantum is the indifferent determinateness sublated, it is the restoration ofquality. § 391 Thirdly, quantum in a qualitative form is quantitative ratio. Quantum transcends itself only generally: in ratio,however, its transition into its otherness is such that this otherness in which it has its determination is at thesame time posited, is another quantum. Thus quantum has returned into itself and in its otherness is related toitself. § 392 At the base of this ratio there is still the externality of quantum; the quanta which are related to each other areindifferent, that is, they have their self−relation in such self−externality. The ratio is thus only a formal unityof quality and quantity. Its dialectic is its transition into their absolute unity, into Measure. Remark: Something's Limit as Quality Chapter 1 QuantityA. PURE QUANTITY § 395 Quantity is sublated being−for−self; the repelling one which related itself only negatively to the excludedone, having passed over into relation to it, treats the other as identical with itself, and in doing so has lost itsdetermination: being−for−self has passed over into attraction. The absolute brittleness of the repelling onehas melted away into this unity which, however, as containing this one, is at the same time determined by theimmanent repulsion, and as unity of the self−externality is unity with itself. Attraction is in this way themoment of continuity in quantity. § 396 Continuity is, therefore, simple, self−same self−relation, which is not interrupted by any limit or exclusion; itis not, however, an immediate unity, but a unity of ones which possess being−for−self. The asunderness ofthe plurality is still contained in this unity, but at the same time as not differentiating or interrupting it. In Science of LogicChapter 1 Quantity46"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"continuity, the plurality is posited as it is in itself; the many are all alike, each is the same as the other and theplurality is, consequently, a simple, undifferentiated sameness. Continuity is this moment of self−sameness ofthe asunderness, the self−continuation of the different ones into those from which they are distinguished. § 397 In continuity, therefore, magnitude immediately possesses the moment of discreteness −− repulsion, as now amoment in quantity. Continuity is self−sameness, but of the Many which, however, do not become exclusive;it is repulsion which expands the selfsameness to continuity. Hence discreteness, on its side, is a coalescentdiscreteness, where the ones are not connected by the void, by the negative, but by their own continuity anddo not interrupt this self−sameness in the many. § 398 Quantity is the unity of these moments of continuity and discreteness, but at first it is so in the form of one ofthem, continuity, as a result of the dialectic of being−for−self, which has collapsed into the form ofself−identical immediacy. Quantity is, as such, this simple result in so far as being−for−self has not yetdeveloped its moments and posited them within itself. It contains them to begin with as being−for−selfposited as it is in truth. The determination of being−for−self was to be a self−sublating relation−to−self, aperpetual coming−out−of−itself. But what is repelled is itself; repulsion is, therefore, the creative flowingaway of itself. On account of the self−sameness of what is repelled, this distinguishing or differentiation is anuninterrupted continuity; and because of the coming−out−of−itself this continuity, without being interrupted,is at the same time a plurality, which no less immediately remains in its self−identicalness. Remark 1: The Conception of Pure Quantity Remark 2: The Kantian Antinomy of the Indivisibility and the Infinite Divisibility B Continuous and Discrete Magnitude Remark: The Usual Separation of These Magnitudes § 432 In the usual ideas of continuous and discrete magnitude, it is overlooked that each of these magnitudescontains both moments, continuity and discreteness, and that the distinction between them consists only inthis, that in one of the moments the determinateness is posited and in the other it is only implicit. Space, time,matter, and so forth are continuous magnitudes in that they are repulsions from themselves, a streaming forthout of themselves which at the same time is not their transition or relating of themselves to a qualitative other.They possess the absolute possibility that the one may be posited in them at any point −− not the emptypossibility of a mere otherness (as when it is said, it is possible that a tree might stand in the place of thisstone), but they contain the principle of the one within themselves; it is one of the determinations whichconstitute them. § 433 Conversely, in discrete magnitude continuity is not to be overlooked; this moment is, as has been shown, theone as unity. Continuous and discrete magnitude can be regarded as species of quantity, provided that magnitude isposited, not under any external determinateness, but under the determinatenesses of its own moments; theordinary transition from genus to species allows external characteristics to be attributed to the formeraccording to some external basis of classification. And besides, continuous and discrete magnitude are not yet Science of LogicChapter 1 Quantity47"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"quanta; they are only quantity itself in each of its two forms. They are perhaps, called magnitudes in so far asthey have in common with quantum simply this−to be a determinateness in quantity. C. LIMITATION OF QUANTITY § 434 Discrete magnitude has first the one for its principle; secondly, it is a plurality of ones; and thirdly, it isessentially continuous; it is the one as at the same time sublated, as unity, the continuation of itself as such inthe discreteness of the ones. Consequently, it is posited as one magnitude, the determinateness of which is theone which, in this posited and determinate being is the excluding one, a limit in the unity. Discrete magnitudeas such is immediately not limited; but as distinguished from continuous magnitude it is a determinate being,a something, with the one as its determinateness and also as its first negation and limit. § 435 This limit, which is related to the unity and is the negation in it, is also, as the one, self−related; it is thus theenclosing, encompassing limit. Limit here is not at first distinguished from its determinate being assomething, but, as the one, is immediately this negative point itself. But the being which here is limited isessentially a continuity, by virtue of which it passes beyond the limit, beyond this one, to which it isindifferent. Real discrete quantity is thus a quantity, or quantum −− quantity as a determinate being and asomething. § 436 Since the one which is a limit includes within itself the many ones of discrete quantity, it equally posits themas sublated within it; and because it is a limit of continuity simply as such, the distinction between continuousand discrete magnitude is here of no significance; or, more correctly, it is a limit to the continuity of the oneas much as of the other; both undergo transition into quanta. Chapter 2 Quantum§ 437 Quantum, which to begin with is quantity with a determinateness or limit in general is, in its completedeterminateness, number. Quantum differentiates itself secondly, into (a) extensive quantum, in which thelimit is a limitation of the determinately existent plurality; and (b) intensive quantum or degree, thedeterminate being having made the transition into being−for−self. Intensive quantum as both for itself and atthe same time immediately outside itself −− since it is an indifferent limit −− has its determinateness in another. As this manifest contradiction of being determined simply within itself yet having its determinatenessoutside it, pointing outside itself for it, quantum posited as being in its own self external to itself, passes overthirdly, into quantitative infinity. A. NUMBER § 438 Quantity is quantum, or has a limit, both as continuous and as discrete magnitude. The difference betweenthese two kinds has here, in the first instance, no immediate significance. Science of LogicChapter 2 Quantum48"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"§ 439 The very nature of quantity as sublated being−for−self is ipso facto to be indifferent to its limit. But equally,too, quantity is not unaffected by the limit or by being, a quantum; for it contains within itself as its ownmoment the one, which is absolutely determined and which, therefore, as posited in the continuity or unity ofquantity, is its limit, but a limit which remains what it has become, simply a one. § 440 This one is thus the principle of quantum, but as the one of quantity. Hence, first, it is continuous, it is aunity; secondly, it is discrete, a plurality of ones, which is implicit in continuous, or explicit in discretemagnitude, the ones having equality with one another, possessing the said continuity, the same unity. Thirdly,this one is also a negation of the many ones as a simple limit, an excluding of its otherness from itself, adetermination of itself in opposition to other quanta. Thus the one is [a] self−relating, [b] enclosing and [c]other−excluding limit. § 441 Quantum completely posited in these determinations is number. The complete positedness lies in theexistence of the limit as a plurality and so in its distinction from the unity. Consequently, number appears as adiscrete magnitude, but in the unity it equally possesses continuity. It is, therefore, also quantum in itscomplete determinateness, for its principle the one, the absolutely determinate. Continuity, in which the oneis present only in principle, as a sublated moment −− posited as a unity −− is the form of indeterminateness. § 442 Quantum, merely as such, is limited generally; its limit is an abstract simple determinateness of it. But inquantum as number, this limit is posited as manifold within itself. It contains the many ones which constituteits determinate being, but does not contain them in an indeterminate manner, for the determinateness of thelimit falls in them; the limit excludes other determinate being, that is, other pluralities and the ones it enclosesare a specific aggregate, the amount −− which is the form taken by discreteness in number −− the other towhich is the unit, the continuity of the amount. Amount and unit constitute the moments of number. § 443 As regards amount, we must see more closely how the many ones of which it consists are present in the limit;it is correct to say of amount that it consists of the many, for the ones are in it not as sublated but asaffirmatively present, only posited with the excluding limit to which they are indifferent. This, however, isnot indifferent to them. In the sphere of determinate being, the relation of the limit to it was primarily suchthat the determinate being persisted as the affirmative on this side of its limit, while the limit, the negation,was found outside on the border of the determinate being; similarly, the breaking−off [in the counting] of themany ones and the exclusion of other ones appears as a determination falling outside the enclosed ones. Butin the qualitative sphere it was found that the limit pervades the determinate being, is coextensive with it, andconsequently that it lies in the nature of something to be limited, that is, finite. In the quantitative sphere anumber, say a hundred, is conceived in such a manner that the hundredth one alone limits the many to makethem a hundred. In one sense this is correct; but on the other hand none of the hundred ones has precedenceover any other for they are only equal −− each is equally the hundredth; thus they all belong to the limitwhich makes the number a hundred and the number cannot dispense with any of them for its determinateness.Hence, relatively to the hundredth one, the others do not constitute a determinate being that is in any waydifferent from the limit, whether they are outside or inside it. Consequently, the number is not a plurality overagainst the enclosing, limiting one, but itself constitutes this limitation which is a specific quantum; the many Science of LogicChapter 2 Quantum49"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"constitute a number, a two, a ten, a hundred, and so on. § 444 Now the limiting one is the number as determined relatively to other numbers, as distinguished from them.But this distinguishing does not become a qualitative determinateness but remains quantitative, falling onlywithin the comparing external reflection; the number, as a one, remains returned into itself and indifferent toothers. This indifference of a number to others is an essential determination of it and constitutes the implicitdeterminedness of the number, but also the number's own externality. Number is thus a numerical one as theabsolutely determinate one, which at the same time has the form of simple immediacy and for which,therefore, the relation to other is completely external. Further, one as a number possesses determinateness (inso far as this is a relation to other) as the moments of itself contained within it, in its difference of unit andamount; and amount is itself a plurality of ones, that is, this absolute externality is in the one itself. Thiscontradiction of number or of quantum as such within itself is the quality of quantum, in the furtherdeterminations of which this contradiction is developed.

It was shown that the chief obstacle to a grasp of the Notion of this infinite isthe stopping short at its merely negative determination as the negation of quantum, instead of advancing tothe simple affirmative determination which is the qualitative moment. The only further remark to be madehere concerns the intrusion of quantitative forms into the pure qualitative forms of thought in philosophy. It isthe relationship of powers in particular which has been applied recently to the determinations of the Notion.The Notion in its immediacy was called the first power or potence; in its otherness or difference, in thedeterminate being of its moments, the second power; and in its return into itself or as a totality, the thirdpower. It is at once evident that power as used thus is a category which essentially belongs to quantum −−these powers do not bear the meaning of the potentia, the dynamis of Aristotle. Thus, the relationship ofpowers expresses determinateness in the form or difference which has reached its truth, but difference as it isin the particular Notion of quantum, not as it is in the Notion as such. In quantum, the negativity whichbelongs to the nature of the Notion is still far from being posited in the determination proper to the Notion;differences which are proper to quantum are superficial determinations for the Notion itself and are still farfrom being determined as they are in the Notion. It was in the infancy of philosophic thinking that numberswere used, as by Pythagoras, to designate universal, essential distinctions − and first and second power, andso on are in this respect not a whit better than numbers. This was a preliminary stage to comprehension in theelement of pure thought; it was not until after Pythagoras that thought determinations themselves werediscovered, i.e., became on their own account objects for consciousness. But to retrogress from suchdeterminations to those of number is the action of a thinking which feels its own incapacity, a thinking which,in Opposition to current philosophical culture which is accustomed to thought determinations, now alsomakes itself ridiculous by pretending that this impotence is something new, superior, and an advance. § 696 There is as little to be said against the expression power when it is used only as a symbol, as there is againstthe use of numbers or any other kind of symbols for Notions − but also there is just as much to be said againstthem as against all symbolism whatever in which pure determinations of the Notion or of philosophy aresupposed to be represented. § 697 Philosophy needs no such help either from the world of sense or from the products of the imagination, orfrom subordinate spheres in its own peculiar province, for the determinations of such spheres are unfitted forhigher spheres and for the whole. This unfitness is manifest whenever categories of the finite are applied tothe infinite; the current determinations of force, or substantiality, cause and effect, and so on, are likewiseonly symbols for expressing, for example, vital or spiritual relationships, i.e. they are untrue determinationsfor such relationships; and still more so are the powers of quantum and degrees of powers, both for such andfor speculative relationships generally. § 698 If numbers, powers, the mathematical infinite, and suchlike are to be used not as symbols but as forms forphilosophical determinations and hence themselves as philosophical forms, then it would be necessary first ofall to demonstrate their philosophical meaning, i.e. the specific nature of their Notion. If this is done, thenthey themselves are superfluous designations; the determinateness of the Notion specifies its own self and itsspecification alone is the correct and fitting designation. The use of those forms is, therefore, nothing morethan a convenient means of evading the task of grasping the determinations of the Notion, of specifying andof justifying them. Science of LogicChapter 3 The Quantitative Relation or Quantitative Ratio51"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Section Three: Measure§ 699 Abstractly expressed, in measure quality and quantity are united. Being as such is an immediate identity ofthe determinateness with itself. This immediacy of the determinateness has sublated itself. Quantity is beingwhich has returned into itself in such a manner that it is a simple self−identity as indifference to thedeterminateness. § 700 But this indifference is only the externality of having the determinateness not in its own self but in an other.Thirdly, we now have self−related externality; as self−related it is also a sublated externality and has withinitself the difference from itself−the difference which, as an externality is the quantitative, and as taken backinto itself is the qualitative, moment. § 701 In transcendental idealism the categories of quantity and quality are followed, after the insertion of relation,by modality, which may therefore be mentioned here. This category has there the meaning of being therelation of the object to thought. According to that idealism thought generally is essentially external to thething−in−itself. In so far as the other categories have only the transcendental character of belonging toconsciousness, but to the objective element of it, so modality as the category of relation to the subject, to thisextent contains relatively the determination of reflection−into−self; i.e. the objectivity which belongs to theother categories is lacking in the categories of modality; these, according to Kant, do not in the least add tothe concept as a determination of the object but only express the relation to the faculty of cognition. Thecategories which Kant groups under modality −− namely, possibility, actuality and necessity will occur laterin their proper place; Kant did not apply the infinitely important form of triplicity −− with him it manifesteditself at first only as a formal spark of light −− to the genera of his categories (quantity, quality, etc.), but onlyto their species which, too, alone he called categories. Consequently he was unable to hit on the third toquality and quantity. § 702 With Spinoza, the mode is likewise the third after substance and attribute; he explains it to be the affectionsof substance, or that element which is in an other through which it is comprehended. According to thisconcept, this third is only externality as such; as has already been mentioned, with. Spinoza generally, therigid nature of substance lacks the return into itself. § 703 The observation here made extends generally to those systems of pantheism which have been partiallydeveloped by thought. The first is being, the one, substance, the infinite, essence; in contrast to thisabstraction the second, namely, all determinateness in general, what is only finite, accidental, perishable,non−essential, etc. can equally abstractly be grouped together; and this is what usually happens as the nextstep in quite formal thinking. But the connection of this second with the first is so evident that one cannotavoid grasping it as also in a unity with the latter; thus with Spinoza, the attribute is the whole substance, butis apprehended by the intellect which is itself a limitation or mode; but in this way the mode, thenon−substantial generally, which can only be grasped through an other, constitutes the other extreme tosubstance, the third generally. Indian pantheism, too, in its monstrous fantasies has in an abstract way Science of LogicSection Three: Measure52"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"received this development which runs like a moderating thread through its extravagances; a point of someinterest in the development is that Brahma, the one of abstract thought, progresses through the shape ofVishnu, particularly in the form of Krishna, to a third form, that of Siva. The determination of this third is themode, alteration, coming−to−be and ceasing−to−be−the field of externality in general. This Indian trinity hasmisled to a comparison with the Christian and it is true that in them a common element of the nature of theNotion can be recognised; but it is essential to gain a more precise consciousness of the difference betweenthem; for not only is this difference infinite, but it is the true, the genuine infinite which constitutes it. Thisthird principle is, according to its determination, the dispersal of the unity of substance into its opposite, notthe return of the unity to itself −− not spirit but rather the non−spiritual. In the true trinity there is not onlyunity but union, the conclusion of the syllogism is a unity possessing content and actuality, a unity which inits wholly concrete determination is spirit. This principle of the mode and of alteration does not, it is true,altogether exclude the unity; in Spinozism, for example, it is precisely the mode as such which is untrue;substance alone is true and to it everything must be brought back. But this is only to submerge all content inthe void, in a merely formal unity lacking all content. Thus Siva, too, is again the great whole, not distinctfrom Brahma, but Brahma himself. In other words, the difference and the determinateness only vanish againbut are not preserved, are not sublated, and the unity does not become a concrete unity, neither is the disunityreconciled. The supreme goal for man placed in the sphere of coming−to−be and ceasing−to−be, of modalitygenerally, is submergence in unconsciousness, unity with Brahma, annihilation; the Buddhist Nirvana,Nibbana etc., is the same. § 704 Now although the mode as such is abstract externality, indifference to qualitative and quantitativedeterminations, and in essence the external and unessential elements are not supposed to count, it is still, onthe other hand, admitted in many cases that everything depends on the kind and manner of the mode; such anadmission means that the mode itself is declared to belong essentially to the substantial nature of a thing, avery indefinite connection but one which at least implies that this external element is not so abstractly anexternality. § 705 Here the mode has the specific meaning of measure. Spinoza's mode, like the Indian principle of change, isthe measureless. The Greek awareness, itself still indeterminate, that everything has a measure −− evenParmenides, after abstract being, introduced necessity as the ancient limit by which all things are bounded −−is the beginning of a much higher conception than that contained in substance and in the difference of themode from substance. § 706 Measure in its more developed, more reflected form is necessity; fate, Nemesis, was restricted in general tothe specific nature of measure, namely, that what is presumptuous, what makes itself too great, too high, isreduced to the other extreme of being brought to nothing, so that the mean of measure, mediocrity is restored.'The absolute, God, is the measure of all things' is not more intensely pantheistic than the definition: 'Theabsolute, God, is being,' but it is infinitely truer. Measure, it is true, is an external kind and manner ofdeterminateness, a more or less, but at the same time it is equally reflected into itself, a determinatenesswhich is not indifferent and external but intrinsic; it is thus the concrete truth of being. That is why mankindhas revered measure as something inviolable and sacred. § 707 Science of LogicSection Three: Measure53"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Idea of essence, namely, to be self−identical in the immediacy of its determined being, is alreadyimmanent in measure; so that the immediacy is thus reduced by this self−identity to something mediated,which equally is mediated only through this externality, but is a mediation with itself −− that is, reflection,the determinations of which are, but in this being are nothing more than moments of their negative unity. Inmeasure, the qualitative moment is quantitative; the determinateness or difference is indifferent and so is nodifference, is sublated. This nature of quantity as a return−into−self in which it is qualitative constitutes thatbeing−in−and−for−itself which is essence. But measure is only in itself or in its Notion essence; this Notionof measure is not yet posited. Measure, still as such, is itself the immediate [seiende] unity of quality andquantity; its moments are determinately present as a quality, and quanta thereof; these moments are at firstinseparable only in principle [an sich], but do not yet have the significance of this reflected determination.The development of measure contains the differentiation of these moments, but at the same time theirrelation, so that the identity which they are in themselves becomes their relation to each other, i.e. is posited.The significance of this development is the realisation of measure in which it posits itself as in relation withitself, and hence as a moment. Through this mediation it is determined as sublated; its immediacy and that ofits moments vanishes; they are reflected. Measure, having thus realised its own Notion, has passed intoessence. § 708 At first, measure is only an immediate unity of quality and quantity, so that: (1), we have a quantum with aqualitative significance, a measure. The progressive determining of this consists in explicating what is onlyimplicit in it, namely, the difference of its moments, of its qualitatively and quantitatively determined being.These moments further develop themselves into wholes of measure which as such are self−subsistent. Theseare essentially in relationship with each other, and so measure becomes (2), a ratio of specific quanta havingthe form of self−subsistent measures. But their self−subsistence also rests essentially on quantitative relationand quantitative difference; and so their self−subsistence becomes a transition of each into the other, with theresult that measure perishes in the measureless. But this beyond of measure is the negativity of measure onlyin principle; this results (3), in the positing of the indifference of the determinations of measure, and thepositing of real measure −− real through the negativity contained in the indifference −− as an inverse ratio ofmeasures which, as self−subsistent qualities, are essentially based only on their quantity and on their negativerelation to one another, thereby demonstrating themselves to be only moments of their truly self−subsistentunity which is their reflection−into−self and the positing thereof, essence. § 709 The development of measure which has been attempted in the following chapters is extremely difficult.Starting from immediate, external measure it should, on the one hand, go on to develop the abstractdetermination of the quantitative aspects of natural objects (a mathematics of nature), and on the other hand,to indicate the connection between this determination of measure and the qualities of natural objects, at leastin general; for the specific proof, derived from the Notion of the concrete object, of the connection betweenits qualitative and quantitative aspects, belongs to the special science of the concrete. Examples of this kindconcerning the law of falling bodies and free, celestial motion will be found in the Encyclopedia. of the Phil.Sciences, 3rd ed., Sections 267 and 270, Remark. In this connection the general observation may be madethat the different forms in which measure is realised belong also to different spheres of natural reality. Thecomplete, abstract indifference of developed measure, i.e. the laws of measure, can only be manifested in thesphere of mechanics in which the concrete bodily factor is itself only abstract matter; the qualitativedifferences of such matter are essentially quantitatively determined; space and time are the purest forms ofexternality, and the multitude of matters, masses, intensity of weight, are similarly external determinationswhich have their characteristic determinateness in the quantitative element. On the other hand, suchquantitative determinateness of abstract matter is deranged simply by the plurality of conflicting qualities inthe inorganic sphere and still more even in the organic world. But here there is involved not merely a conflict Science of LogicSection Three: Measure54"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"of qualities, for measure here is subordinated to higher relationships and the immanent development ofmeasure tends to be reduced to the simple form of immediate measure. The limbs of the animal organismhave a measure which, as a simple quantum, stands in a ratio to the other quanta of the other limbs; theproportions of the human body are the fixed ratio of such quanta. Natural science is still far from possessingan insight into the connection between such quantities and the organic functions on which they whollydepend. But the readiest example of the reduction of an immanent measure to a merely externally determinedmagnitude is motion. In the celestial bodies it is free motion, a motion which is determined solely by theNotion and whose quantitative elements therefore equally depend solely on the Notion (see above); but suchfree motion is reduced by the living creature to arbitrary or mechanically regular, i.e. a wholly abstract,formal motion. § 710 And in the realm of spirit there is still less to be found a characteristic, free development of measure. It isquite evident, for example, that a republican constitution like that of Athens, or an aristocratic constitutiontempered by democracy, is suitable only for States of a certain size, and that in a developed civil society thenumbers of individuals belonging to different occupations stand in a certain relations to one another; but allthis yields neither laws of measure nor characteristic forms of it. In the spiritual sphere as such there occurdifferences of intensity of character, strength of imagination, sensations, general ideas, and so on; but thedetermination does not go beyond the indefiniteness of strength or weakness. How insipid and completelyempty the so−called laws turn out to be which have been laid down about the relation of strength andweakness of sensations, general ideas, and so on, comes home to one on reading the psychologies whichoccupy themselves with such laws. Chapter 1: Specific QuantityA The Specific QuantumB Specifying Measure(a) The Rule(b) Specifying Measure(c) Relation of the Two Sides as QualitiesRemark § 736 The exposition here of the connection between the qualitative nature of something and its quantitativedetermination has its application in the already indicated example of motion. First of all, in velocity as thedirect ratio of space traversed and time elapsed, the magnitude of time is taken as denominator while that ofspace is taken as numerator. If velocity as such is only a ratio of the space and time in a motion, it isimmaterial which of the two moments is to be considered as amount or as unit. Space, however, like weightin specific gravity, is an external, real whole as such −− hence amount −− whereas time, like volume, is theideal, negative factor, the side of unity. But here there essentially belongs the more important ratio, thatwhich holds between the magnitudes of space and time in free motion; at first, in the still conditioned motionof a falling body where the time factor is determined as a root and the space factor as a square, or in theabsolutely free motion of the celestial bodies where the period of revolution is lower by one power than thedistance from the sun, the former being a square and the latter a cube. Fundamental relationships of this kindrest on the nature of the interrelated qualities of space and time and on the kind of relation in which theystand, either as a mechanical motion, i.e. as an unfree motion which is not determined by the Notion of themoments of space and time, or as the descent of a falling body, i.e. as a conditionally free motion, or as theabsolutely free celestial motion. These kinds of motion, no less than their laws, rest on the development of Science of LogicChapter 1: Specific Quantity55"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"the Notion of their moments, of space and time, since these qualities as such (space and time) prove to be inthemselves, i.e. in their Notion, inseparable and their quantitative relationship is the being−for−self ofmeasure, is only one measure−determination. § 737 In regard to the absolute relations of measure, it is well to bear in mind that the mathematics of nature, if it isto be worthy of the name of science, must be essentially the science of measures −− a science for which it istrue much has been done empirically, but little as yet from a strictly scientific, that is, philosophical point ofview. Mathematical principles of natural philosophy−as Newton called his work−if they are to fulfil thisdescription in a profounder sense than that accorded to them by Newton and by the entire Baconian species ofphilosophy and science, must contain things of quite a different character in order to bring light into thesestill obscure regions which are, however, worthy in the highest degree of consideration. It is a great service to ascertain the empirical numbers of nature, e.g., the distances of the planets from oneanother; but it is an infinitely greater service when the empirical quanta are made to disappear and they areraised into a universal form of determinations of quantity so that they become moments of a law or ofmeasure −− immortal services which Galileo for the descent of falling bodies and Kepler for the motion ofthe celestial bodies, have achieved. The laws they discovered they have proved in this sense, that they haveshown the whole compass of the particulars of observation to correspond to them. But yet a still higher proofis required for these laws; nothing else, that is, than that their quantitative relations be known from thequalities or specific Notions of time and space that are correlated. Of this kind of proof there is still no trace in the said mathematical principles of natural philosophy, neither isthere in the subsequent works of this kind. It has already been remarked in connection with the show ofmathematical proofs of certain relationships in nature, a show based on the misuse of the infinitely small, thatit is absurd to try todemonstrate such proofs on a strictly mathematical basis, i.e. neither empirically nor fromthe standpoint of the Notion. These proofs presuppose thir theorems, those very laws, from experience; whatthey succeed in doing is to reduce them to abstract expressions and convenient formulae. Undoubtedly the time will come when, with a clearer understanding of what mathematics can accomplish andhas accomplished, the entire, real merit of Newton as against Kepler −− the sham scaffolding of proofs beingdiscarded −− will clearly be seen to be restricted to the said transformation of Kepler's formula and to theelementary analytical treatment accorded to it.

It is on the one hand a merely quantitative progress and regress, a perpetual adding orsubtracting, so that each number has the same arithmetical relation to the one before it and after it, as thesehave to their predecessors and successors, and so on. But the numbers so formed also have a specific relationto other numbers preceding and following them, being either an integral multiple of one of them or else apower or a root. In the musical scale which is built up on quantitative differences, a quantum gives rise to anharmonious relation without its own relation to those on either side of it in the scale differing from therelation between these again and their predecessors and successors. While successive notes seem to be at anever−increasing distance from the keynote, or numbers in succeeding each other arithmetically seem only tobecome other numbers, the fact is that there suddenly emerges a return, a surprising accord, of which no hintwas given by the quality of what immediately preceded it, but which appears as an actio in distans, as aconnection with something far removed. There is a sudden interruption of the succession of merelyindifferent relations which do not alter the preceding specific reality or do not even form any such, andalthough the succession is continued quantitatively in the same manner, a specific relation breaks in persaltum. § 775 Such qualitative nodes and leaps occur in chemical combinations when the mixture proportions areprogressively altered; at certain points in the scale of mixtures, two substances form products exhibitingparticular qualities. These products are distinguished from one another not merely by a more or less, and theyare not already present, or only perhaps in a weaker degree, in the proportions close to the nodal proportions,but are bound up with these nodes themselves. For example, different oxides of nitrogen and nitric acidshaving essentially different qualities are formed only when oxygen and nitrogen are combined in certainspecific proportions, and no such specific compounds are formed by the intermediate proportions. Metaloxides, e.g. the lead oxides, are formed at certain quantitative points of oxidation and are distinguished bycolours and other qualities. They do not pass gradually into one another; the proportions lying in betweenthese nodes do not produce a neutral or a specific substance. Without having passed through the interveningstages, a specific compound appears which is based on a measure relation and possesses characteristicqualities. Again, water when its temperature is altered does not merely get more or less hot but passesthrough from the liquid into either the solid or gaseous states; these states do not appear gradually; on thecontrary, each new state appears as a leap, suddenly interrupting and checking the gradual succession oftemperature changes at these points. Every birth and death, far from being a progressive gradualness, is aninterruption of it and is the leap from a quantitative into a qualitative alteration. § 776 It is said, natura non facit saltum [there are no leaps in nature]; and ordinary thinking when it has to grasp acoming−to−be or a ceasing−to−be, fancies it has done so by representing it as a gradual emergence ordisappearance. But we have seen that the alterations of being in general are not only the transition of onemagnitude into another, but a transition from quality into quantity and vice versa, a becoming−other which isan interruption of gradualness and the production of something qualitatively different from the reality whichpreceded it. Water, in cooling, does not gradually harden as if it thickened like porridge, gradually solidifyinguntil it reached the consistency of ice; it suddenly solidifies, all at once. It can remain quite fluid even atfreezing point if it is standing undisturbed, and then a slight shock will bring it into the solid state. § 777 In thinking about the gradualness of the coming−to−be of something, it is ordinarily assumed that whatcomes to be is already sensibly or actually in existence; it is not yet perceptible only because of its smallness.Similarly with the gradual disappearance of something, the non−being or other which takes its place is Science of LogicChapter 2 Real Measure57"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"likewise assumed to be really there, only not observable, and there, too, not in the sense of being implicitly orideally contained in the first something, but really there, only not observable. In this way, the form of thein−itself, the inner being of something before it actually exists, is transformed into a smallness of an outerexistence, and the essential difference, that of the Notion, is converted into an external difference of meremagnitude. The attempt to explain coming−to−be or ceasing−to−be on the basis of gradualness of thealteration is tedious like any tautology; what comes to be or ceases to be is assumed as already complete andin existence beforehand and the alteration is turned into a mere change of an external difference, with theresult that the explanation is in fact a mere tautology. The intellectual difficulty attendant on such anattempted explanation comes from the qualitative transition from something into its other in general, and theninto its opposite; but the identity and the alteration are misrepresented as the indifferent, externaldeterminations of the quantitative sphere. § 778 In the moral sphere, in so far as it is considered under the categories of being, there occurs the same transitionfrom quantity into quality and different qualities appear to be based in a difference of magnitude. It is through a more or less that the measure of frivolity or thoughtlessness is exceeded and something quitedifferent comes about, namely crime, and thus right becomes wrong and virtue vice. Thus states, too, acquirethrough their quantitative difference, other things being assumed equal, a distinct qualitative character. Withthe expansion of the state and an increased number of citizens, the laws and the constitution acquire adifferent significance. The state has its own measure of magnitude and when this is exceeded this merechange of size renders it liable to instability and disruption under that same constitution which was its goodfortune and its strength before its expansion. C The Measureless Chapter 3: The Becoming of EssenceA Absolute IndifferenceB Indifference as an Inverse Ratio of its FactorsRemark: Centripetal and Centrifugal ForceC Transition into Essence § 803 Absolute indifference is the final determination of being before it becomes essence; but it does not attain toessence. It reveals itself as still belonging to the sphere of being through the fact that, determined asindifferent, it still contains difference as an external, quantitative determination; this is its determinate being,contrasted with which absolute indifference is determined as being only implicitly the absolute, not theabsolute grasped as actuality. In other words, it is external reflection which stops short at conceiving thedifferences in themselves or in the absolute as one and the same, thinking of them as only indifferentlydistinguished, not as intrinsically distinct from one another. The further step which requires to be made hereis to grasp that this reflection of the differences into their unity is not merely the product of the externalreflection of the subjective thinker, but that it is the very nature of the differences of this unity to sublatethemselves, with the result that their unity proves to be absolute negativity, its indifference to be just as muchindifferent to itself, to its own indifference, as it is indifferent to otherness. § 804 Science of LogicChapter 3: The Becoming of Essence58"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"But we are already familiar with this self−sublating of the determination of indifference; in the developmentof its positedness, this determination has shown itself to be from every aspect a contradiction. It is in itself thetotality in which every determination of being is sublated and contained; it is thus the substrate, but at firstonly in the one−sided determination of the in−itself, and consequently the differences, namely, thequantitative difference and the inverse ratio of factors, are present in it only in an external manner. As thusthe contradiction of itself and its determinedness, of its implicit determination and its positeddeterminateness, it is the negative totality whose determinatenesses have sublated themselves in themselvesand in so doing have sublated this fundamental one−sidedness of theirs, their [merely] implicit being[Ansichsein]. The result is that indifference is now posited as what it in fact is, namely a simple and infinite,negative relation−to−self, its inherent incompatibility with itself, a repelling of itself from itself. The processof determining and being determined is not a transition, nor an external alteration, nor an emergence ofdeterminations in the indifference, but is its own self−relating which is the negativity of itself, of its [merely]implicit being. § 805 Now these repelled determinations do not possess themselves, do not emerge as self−subsistent or externaldeterminations, but first, as moments belonging to the implicit unity, they are not expelled from it but areborne by it as the substrate and are filled solely by it; secondly, as determinations which are immanent in theexplicated unity, they are only through their repulsion from themselves. The being of the determinations is nolonger simply affirmative as in the entire sphere of being, but is now a sheer positedness, the determinationshaving the fixed character and significance of being related to their unity, each consequently being related toits other and with negation; this is the mark of their relativity. § 806 Thus we see that being in general and the being or immediacy of the distinct determinatenesses, no less thanthe implicit being, has vanished and the unity is being, an immediate presupposed totality such that it is thissimple self−relation only as a result of the sublating of this presupposition, and this presupposedness andimmediate being is itself only a moment of its repelling, the original self−subsistence and self−Identity isonly as the resulting coming together with itself. Being, in its determining, has thus determined itself toessence, a being which, through the sublating of being, is a simple being−with−itself. Volume One: The Objective Logic. Book Two: The Doctrineof EssenceReflection − Appearance − Actuality § 807 The truth of being is essence. Being is the immediate. Since knowing has for its goal knowledge of the true, knowledge of what being is inand for itself, it does not stop at the immediate and its determinations, but penetrates it on the supposition thatat the back of this being there is something else, something other than being itself, that this backgroundconstitutes the truth of being. This knowledge is a mediated knowing for it is not found immediately with andin essence, but starts from an other, from being, and has a preliminary path to tread, that of going beyondbeing or rather of penetrating into it. Not until knowing inwardises, recollects itself out of immediate being,does it through this mediation find essence. The German language has preserved essence in the past participle[gewesen] of the verb to be; for essence is past −− but timelessly past −− being. Science of LogicVolume One: The Objective Logic. Book Two: The Doctrine of Essence59"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"§ 808 When this movement is pictured as the path of knowing, then this beginning with being, and the developmentthat sublates it, reaching essence as a mediated result, appears to be an activity of knowing external to being,and irrelevant to being's own nature. § 809 But this path is the movement of being itself. It was seen that being inwardises itself through its on nature,and through this movement into itself becomes essence. § 810 If, therefore, the absolute was at first defined as being, now it is defined as essence. Cognition certainlycannot stop short at manifold determinate being, nor yet at being, pure being; the reflection that immediatelyforces itself on one is that this pure being, the negation of everything finite, presupposes an internalisation, arecollection [Erinnerung] and movement which has purified immediate, determinate being to pure being.Being is accordingly determined as essence, as a being in which everything determinate and finite is negated.It is thus the indeterminate, simple unity from which what is determinate has been eliminated in an externalmanner; the determinate element itself was external to this unity and, after this elimination, still remainsconfronting it; for it has not been sublated in itself but only relatively, only in relation to this unity. We havealready mentioned that if essence is defined as the sum total of all realities, then these realities likewise aresubordinate to the nature of the determinateness and to the abstractive reflection and this sum total reduces toempty oneness. Essence is in this way only a product, an artefact. § 811 External negation −− and this is what abstraction is −− only shifts the determinatenesses of being away fromwhat is left over as Essence; it only puts them, so to speak, elsewhere, leaving them the affirmative characterthey possessed before. But in this way, essence is neither in itself nor for itself; what it is, it is through another, the external, abstract reflection; and it is for an other, namely abstraction and, in general, for the simplyaffirmative being that remains confronting it. Its character, therefore, is to lack all determinate character, tobe inherently lifeless and empty. § 812 But essence as it has here come to be, is what it is, through a negativity which is not alien to it but is its veryown, the infinite movement of being. It is being that is in itself and for itself; it is absolute being−in−itself inthat it is indifferent to every determinateness of being, and otherness and relation−to−other have beencompletely sublated. But it is not only this being−in−itself; as mere being−in−itself it would be only theabstraction of pure essence; but it is equally essentially being−for−self; it is itself this negativity, theself−sublating of otherness and determinateness. § 813 Essence as the completed return of being into itself is thus at first indeterminate essence. The determinatenessof being are sublated in it; they are contained in essence in principle but are not posited in it Absolute essencein this simple equality with itself has no determinate being; but it must develop determinate being, for it isboth in itself and for itself, i.e. differentiates the determinations which are implicit in it. Because it isself−repelling or indifferent to itself, negative self−relation, it sets itself over against itself and is infinitebeing−for−self only in so far is as it is at one with itself in this its own difference from itself.

Essence is absolute unity of being−in−itselfand being−for−itself; consequently its determining remains within this unity and is neither a becoming nor atransition, nor are the determinations themselves an other as other, or relations to other; they are self−subsistent, but at the same time only in their association with each other in this unity. Since essence is atfirst simple negativity, it now has to posit in its own sphere the determinateness that is only implicit in it, inorder to give itself determinate being and then being−for−self. § 814 In the whole of logic, essence occupies the same place as quantity does in the sphere of being; absoluteindifference to limit. But quantity is this indifference in an immediate determination, and the limit is presentin it as an immediately external determinateness, quantity passes over into quantum; the external limit isnecessary to quantity and is affirmatively present in it [ist an ihr seiend]. In essence, −− on the other hand, thedeterminateness is not a simple immediacy but is present only as posited by essence itself; it is not free, but ispresent only as connected with its unity. The negativity of essence is reflection; and the determinations arereflected, posited by essence itself and remaining in essence as sublated. § 815 Essence stands between being and Notion; it constitutes their mean, and its movement is the transition frombeing into the Notion. Essence is being−in−and−for−itself, but in the determination of being−in−itself; for thegeneral determination of essence is to have proceeded from being, or to be the first negation of being. Itsmovement consists in positing within itself the negation or determination, thereby giving itself determinatebeing and becoming as infinite being−for−self what it is in itself. It thus gives itself its determinate being thatis equal to its being−in−itself and becomes Notion. For the Notion is the absolute that in its determinate beingis absolute, or is in and for itself. But the determinate being which essence gives itself is not vet determinatebeing as in and for itself, but as given by essence to itself, or as posited, and is consequently still distinct fromthe determinate being of the Notion. § 816 At first, essence shines or shows within itself, or is reflection; secondly, it appears; thirdly, it manifests itself.In its movement, essence posits itself in the following determinations: I.

As essence that is one with its Appearance, as actuality.Section One: Essence as Reflection Within Itself§ 817 Essence issues from being; hence it is not immediately in and for itself but is a result of that movement. Or ifessence is taken at first as an immediacy, then it is a specific determinate being confronted by another such; itis only essential, as opposed to unessential, determinate being. But essence is being that has been sublated inand for itself; what confronts it is only illusory being [Schein]. The illusory being, however, is essence's ownpositing. Essence is first reflection. Reflection determines itself and its determinations are a positedness which is at thesame time reflection−into−self.

Thirdly, essence as the reflection−into−self of its determining converts itself into ground and passes over intoExistence and Appearance. Chapter 1 Illusory Being§ 818 Essence that issues from being seems to confront it as an opposite; this immediate being is, in the firstinstance, the unessential. But secondly, it is more than merely unessential being, it is essenceless being, it is illusory being. Thirdly, this illusory being is not something external to or other than essence; on the contrary, it is essence'sown illusory being. The showing of this illusory being within essence itself is reflection. A THE ESSENTIAL AND THE UNESSENTIAL § 819 Essence is sublated being. It is simple equality with itself, but only in so far as it is the negation of the sphereof being in general. Essence thus has immediacy confronting it as an immediacy from which it has become and which in thissublating has preserved and maintained itself. In this determination, essence itself is simply affirmative[seiendes], immediate essence, and being is only a negative in relation to essence, not in and for itself;therefore essence is a determinate negation. In this way, being and essence are again related to each other asothers; for each has a being, an immediacy, and these are indifferent to each other, and with respect to thisbeing, being and essence are equal in value. § 820 But at the same time, being, as contrasted with essence, is the unessential; in relation to essence, it has thedetermination of sublated being. Yet in so far as it is only related to essence simply as an other, essence is notstrictly essence but only a differently determined being, the essential. § 821 The distinction of essential and unessential has caused essence to relapse into the sphere of determinatebeing, since essence in its initial phase is determined as immediate, simply affirmative [seiendes] essence andhence only as other over against being. The sphere of determinate being is thereby made the base, and the factthat the being in this determinate being is being−in−and−for−itself, is a further determination external todeterminate being itself; and conversely, while essence is indeed being−in−and−for−itself, it is so only inrelation to an other, in a specific reference. Accordingly, in so far as the distinction is made of an essentialand an unessential side in something [Dasein], this distinction is externally posited, a separation of one partof it from another that does not affect the something itself, a division which has its origin in a third. Such adivision does not settle what is essential and what is unessential. It originates in some external standpoint andconsideration and the same content can therefore be regarded now as essential and again as unessential. Science of LogicChapter 1 Illusory Being62"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"§ 822 Closer consideration shows that when essence is characterised as essential only relatively to what isunessential, it is because it is taken only as sublated being or determinate being. In this way, essence is onlythe first negation, or the negation which is a determinateness through which being becomes only determinatebeing, or the latter becomes only an other. But essence is the absolute negativity of being; it is being itself,but not determined only as an other, but being that has sublated itself both as immediate being and also asimmediate negation, as negation that is infected with otherness. Thus being, or determinate being, has notpreserved itself as an other −− for we are in the sphere of essence −− and the immediate that is stilldistinguished from essence is not merely an unessential determinate being but the immediate that is in and foritself a nullity; it is only a non−essence, illusory being. B ILLUSORY BEING § 823 1. Being is illusory being. The being of illusory being consists solely in the sublatedness of being, in itsnothingness; this nothingness it has in essence and apart from its nothingness, apart from essence, illusorybeing is not. It is the negative posited as negative. § 824 Illusory being is all that still remains from the sphere of being. But it seems still to have an immediate sidethat is independent of essence and to be simply an other of essence. The other contains in general the twomoments of determinate being and negated determinate being. Since the unessential no longer has a being, allthat remains to it of otherness is the pure moment of negated determinate being; illusory being is thisimmediate, negated determinate being in the determinateness of being, in such wise that it has determinatebeing only in relation to an other, only in its negated determinate being; the non−self−subsistent which isonly in its negation. All that is left to it, therefore, is the pure determinateness of immediacy; it is reflectedimmediacy, that is, immediacy which is only by means of its negation and which, when contrasted with itsmediation, is nothing but the empty determination of the immediacy of negated determinate being. § 825 Thus illusory being is the phenomenon of scepticism, and the Appearance of idealism, too, is such animmediacy which is not a something or a thing, in general, not an indifferent being that would still be, apartfrom its determinateness and connection with the subject. Scepticism did not permit itself to say 'It is';modern idealism did not permit itself to regard knowledge as a knowing of the thing−in−itself; the illusorybeing of scepticism was supposed to lack any foundation of being, and in idealism the thing−in−itself was notsupposed to enter into knowledge. But at the same time scepticism admitted a multitude of determinations ofits illusory being, or rather its illusory being had for content the entire manifold wealth of the world. Inidealism, too, Appearance embraces within itself the range of these manifold determinatenesses. This illusory being and this Appearance are immediately thus manifoldly determined. This content, therefore,may well have no being, no thing−in−itself at its base; it remains on its own account as it is; the content hasonly been transferred from being into an illusory being, so that the latter has within itself those manifolddeterminatenesses, which are immediate, simply affirmative, and mutually related as others. Illusory being is,therefore, itself immediately determinate. It can have this or that content; whatever content it has, illusorybeing does not posit this itself but has it immediately. The various forms of idealism, Leibnizian, Kantian,Fichtean, and others, have not advanced beyond being as determinateness, have not advanced beyond thisimmediacy, any more than scepticism did. Scepticism permits the content of its illusory being to be given to Science of LogicChapter 1 Illusory Being63"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"it; whatever content it is supposed to have, for scepticism it is immediate. The monad of Leibnitz evolves itsideas and representations out of itself; but it is not the power that generates and binds them together, rather dothey arise in the monad like bubbles; they are indifferent and immediate over against one another and thesame in relation to the monad itself. Similarly, the Kantian Appearance is a given content of perception; itpresupposes affections, determinations of the subject, which are immediate relatively to themselves and to thesubject. It may well be that the infinite obstacle of Fichte's idealism has no underlying thing−in−itself, so thatit becomes purely a determinateness in the ego; but for the ego, this determinateness which it appropriatesand whose externality it sublates is at the same time immediate, a limitation of the ego, which it cantranscend but which has in it an element of indifference, so that although the limitation is on the ego, itcontains an immediate non−being of the ego. § 826 2. Illusory being, therefore, contains an immediate presupposition, a side that is independent of essence. Butit does not have to be shown that illusory being, in so far as it is distinct from essence, sublates itself andwithdraws into essence; for being in its totality has withdrawn into essence; illusory being is in itself anullity; all that has to be shown is that the determinations which distinguish it from essence aredeterminations of essence itself, and further, that this determinateness of essence which illusory being is, issublated in essence itself. § 827 It is the immediacy of non−being that constitutes illusory being; but this non−being is nothing else but thenegativity of essence present within it. In essence, being is non−being. Its intrinsic nothingness is thenegative nature of essence itself. But the immediacy or indifference which this non−being contains isessence's own absolute being−in−itself. The negativity of essence is its equality with itself or its simpleimmediacy and indifference. Being has preserved itself in essence in so far as the latter in its infinitenegativity has this equality with itself; it is through this that essence itself is being. The immediacy of thedeterminateness in illusory being over against essence is consequently nothing other than essence's ownimmediacy; but the immediacy is not simply affirmative [seiend], but is the purely mediated or reflectedimmediacy that is illusory being−being, not as being, but only as the determinateness of being as opposed tomediation; being as a moment. § 828 These two moments, namely the nothingness which yet is and the being which is only a moment, or theimplicit negativity and the reflected immediacy that constitute the moments of illusory being, are thus themoments of essence itself. What we have here is not an illusory show of being in essence, or an illusory showof essence in being; the illusory being in essence is not the illusory being of an other, but is illusory being perse, the illusory being of essence itself What we have here is not an illusory show of being in essence, or an illusory show of essence in being; theillusory being in essence is not the illusory being of an other, but is illusory being per se, the illusory being ofessence itself. § 829 Illusory being is essence itself in the determinateness of being. Essence has an illusory being because it isdeterminate within itself and thereby distinguished from its absolute unity. But equally this determinatenessis absolutely sublated in its own self. For essence is the self−subsistent, which is as self−mediated through itsnegation, which negation essence itself is; it is therefore the identical unity of absolute negativity and Science of LogicChapter 1 Illusory Being64"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"immediacy. The negativity is negativity per se; it is its relation to itself and is thus in itself immediacy; but itis negative self−relation, a negating that is a repelling of itself, and the intrinsic immediacy is thus negative ordeterminate in regard to it. But this determinateness is itself absolute negativity, and this determining whichis, as determining, immediately the sublating of itself, is a return−into−self. § 830 Illusory being is the negative that has a being, but in an other, in its negation; it is a non−self−subsistent beingwhich is in its own self−sublated and null. As such, it is the negative returned into itself, non−self−subsistentbeing as in its own self not self−subsistent. This self−relation of the negative or of non−self−subsistent beingis its immediacy; it is an other than the negative itself; it is its determinateness over against itself; or it is thenegation directed against the negative. But negation directed against the negative is purely self−relatednegativity, the absolute sublating of the determinateness itself. § 831 The determinateness, therefore, which illusory being is in essence is infinite determinateness; it is the purelyself−coincident negative; it is thus the determinateness which as such is self−subsistent and indeterminate.Conversely, the self−subsistent, as self−related immediacy, is equally sheer determinateness and moment andis only as self−related negativity. This negativity that is identical with immediacy and immediacy that is thusidentical with negativity, is essence. Illusory being, therefore, is essence itself, but essence in adeterminateness, in such a manner, however, that this is only a moment of essence and essence is thereflection of itself within itself. § 832 In the sphere of being, there arises over against being as an immediacy, non−being, which is likewise animmediacy, and their truth is becoming. In the sphere of essence, we have first essence opposed to theunessential, then essence opposed to illusory being, that is, to the unessential and to illusory bel rig as theremainder of being. But both essence and illusory being, and also the difference of essence from them, derivesolely from the fact that essence is at first taken as an immediate, not as it is in itself, namely, not as animmediacy that is as pure mediation or absolute negativity. The first immediacy is thus only thedeterminateness of immediacy. The sublating of this determinateness of essence, therefore, consists simplyand solely in showing that the unessential is only illusory being and that the truth is rather that essencecontains the illusory being within itself as the infinite immanent movement that determines its immediacy asnegativity and its negativity as immediacy, and is thus the reflection of itself within itself. Essence in this itsself−movement is reflection C REFLECTION(a) Positing Reflection(b) External Reflection(c) Determining ReflectionChapter 2 The Essentialities or Determinations of Reflection§ 860 Reflection is determinate reflection; hence essence is determinate essence, or it is an essentiality. Reflection is the showing of the illusory being of essence within essence itself. Essence, as infinitereturn−into−self, is not immediate but negative simplicity; it is a movement through distinct moments, Science of LogicChapter 2 The Essentialities or Determinations of Reflection65"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"absolute self−mediation. But it reflects itself into these its moments which consequently are themselvesdeterminations reflected into themselves. § 861 Essence is at first, simple self−relation, pure identity. This is its determination, but as such it is rather theabsence of any determination. Secondly, the proper determination is difference, a difference that is, on the one hand, external or indifferent,diversity in general, and on the other hand, is opposed diversity or opposition. Thirdly, as contradiction, the opposition is reflected into itself and withdrawn into its ground. Remark: A = A A IDENTITYB DIFFERENCE(a) Absolute Difference(b) DiversityRemark: The Law of Diversity § 902 Diversity, like identity, is expressed in its own law. And both these laws are held apart as indifferentlydifferent, so that each is valid on its own without respect to the other. § 903 All things are different, or: there are no two things like each other. This proposition is, in fact, opposed to thelaw of identity, for it declares: A is distinctive, therefore A is also not A; or: A is unlike something else, sothat it is not simply A but rather a specific A. A's place in the law of identity can be taken by any othersubstrate, but A as distinctive [als Ungleiches] can no longer be exchanged with any other. True, it issupposed to be distinctive, not from itself, but only from another; but this distinctiveness is its owndetermination. As self−identical A, it is indeterminate; but as determinate it is the opposite of this; it nolonger has only self−identity, but also a negation and therefore a difference of itself from itself within it. § 904 That everything is different from everything else is a very superfluous proposition, for things in the pluralimmediately involve manyness and wholly indeterminate diversity. But the proposition that no two things arecompletely like each other, expresses more, namely, determinate difference. Two things are not merely two−− numerical manyness is only one−and−the−sameness −− but they are different through a determination.Ordinary thinking is struck by the proposition that no two things are like each other −− as in the story of howLeibniz propounded it at court and caused the ladies to look at the leaves of trees to see whether they couldfind two alike. Happy times for metaphysics when it was the occupation of courtiers and the testing of itspropositions called for no more exertion than to compare leaves! The reason why this proposition is strikinglies in what has been said, that two, or numerical manyness, does not contain any determinate difference andthat diversity as such, in its abstraction, is at first indifferent to likeness and unlikeness. Ordinary thinking,even when it goes on to a determination of diversity, takes these moments themselves to be mutuallyindifferent, so that one without the other, the mere likeness of things without unlikeness, suffices todetermine whether the things are different even when they are only a numerical many, not unlike, but simply Science of LogicChapter 2 The Essentialities or Determinations of Reflection66"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"different without further qualification. The law of diversity, on the other hand, asserts that things are differentfrom one another through unlikeness, that the determination of unlikeness belongs to them just as much asthat of likeness, for determinate difference is constituted only by both together. § 905 Now this proposition that unlikeness must be predicated of all things, surely stands in need of proof; it cannotbe set up as an immediate proposition, for even in the ordinary mode of cognition a proof is demanded of thecombination of different determinations in a synthetic proposition, or else the indication of a third term inwhich they are mediated. This proof would have to exhibit the passage of identity into difference, and thenthe passage of this into determinate difference, into unlikeness. But as a rule this is not done. We have foundthat diversity or external difference is, in truth, reflected into itself, is difference in its own self, that theindifferent subsistence of the diverse is a mere positedness and therefore not an external, indifferentdifference, but a single relation of the two moments. § 906 This involves the dissolution and nullity of the law of diversity. Two things are not perfectly alike; so theyare at once alike and unlike; alike, simply because they are things, or just two, without further qualification−− for each is a thing and a one, no less than the other −− but they are unlike ex hypothesi. We are thereforepresented with this determination, that both moments, likeness and unlikeness, are different in one and thesame thing, or that the difference, while falling asunder, is at the same time one and the same relation. Thishas therefore passed over into opposition. § 907 The togetherness of both predicates is held asunder by the 'in so far', namely, when it is said that two thingsare alike in so far as they are not unlike, or on the one side or in one respect are alike, but on another side orin another respect are unalike. The effect of this is to remove the unity of likeness and unlikeness from thething, and to adhere to what would be the thing's own reflection and the merely implicit reflection of likenessand unlikeness, as a reflection external to the thing. But it is this reflection that, in one and the same activity,distinguishes the two sides of likeness and unlikeness, hence contains both in one activity, lets the one show,be reflected, in the other. But the usual tenderness for things, whose only care is that they do not contradictthemselves, forgets here as elsewhere that in this way the contradiction is not resolved but merely shiftedelsewhere, into subjective or external reflection generally, and this reflection in fact contains in one unity assublated and mutually referred, the two moments which are enunciated by this removal and displacement as amere positedness.

The fact is, before it exists; it is, in fact,as essence or as an unconditioned; secondly, it has determinate being or is determinate, and this in thetwo−fold manner above considered, on the one hand, in its conditions, and on the other, in its ground. In theformer, it has given itself the form of external groundless being because it is, as absolute reflection, negativeself−relation, and it makes itself into its own presupposition. § 1034 This presupposed un−conditioned is therefore the groundless immediate, whose being is nothing except to bepresent as something groundless. When, therefore, all the conditions of the fact are present, that is when thetotality of the fact is posited as a groundless immediate, this scattered multiplicity inwardises [erinnert] itselfin its own self. The whole fact must be present in its conditions, or all the conditions belong to its Existence,for all of them constitute the reflection; or, determinate being, because it is condition, is determined by form;consequently its determinations are determinations of reflection and the positing of one essentially involvesthe positing of the others. The inwardisation of the conditions is at first the falling to the ground [dasZugrundegehen] of immediate determinate being and the becoming of the ground. But this makes the grounda posited ground, that is, it is just as much sublated ground and immediate being, as it is ground. Whentherefore all the conditions of the fact are present, they sublate themselves as immediate being andpresupposition, and equally ground sublates itself. Ground emerges merely as an illusory being thatimmediately vanishes; accordingly, this emergence is the tautological movement of the fact to itself, and itsmediation by conditions and ground is the vanishing of both. The emergence into Existence is thereforeimmediate in such a manner that it is mediated only by the vanishing of mediation. § 1035 The fact emerges from the ground. It is not grounded or posited by it in such a manner that ground remains asa substrate; on the contrary, the positing is the movement of the ground outwards to itself and its simplevanishing. Through its union with the conditions, ground receives an external immediacy and the moment ofbeing. But it receives this not as something external, nor through an external relation; on the contrary, asground, it makes itself into a positedness, its simple essentiality unites with itself in the positedness and is, inthis sublation of itself, the vanishing of its difference from its positedness, and is thus simple essential Science of LogicChapter 3 Ground68"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"immediacy. Ground, therefore, does not remain behind as something distinct from the grounded, but the truthof grounding is that in it ground is united with itself, so that its reflection into another is its reflection intoitself. Consequently, the fact is not only the unconditioned but also the groundless, and it emerges fromground only in so far as ground has 'fallen to the ground' and ceased to be ground: it emerges from thegroundless, that is, from its own essential negativity or pure form. This immediacy that is mediated by ground and condition and is self−identical through the sublating ofmediation, is Existence. Section Two: Appearance§ 1036 Essence must appear Being is the absolute abstraction; this negativity is not something external to being, which is being, andnothing but being, only as this absolute negativity. For the same reason, being only is as self−sublating beingand is essence. But, conversely, essence as simple equality with itself is likewise being. The doctrine of beingcontains the first proposition: being is essence. The second proposition: essence is being, constitutes thecontent of the first section of the doctrine of essence. But this being into which essence makes itself isessential being, Existence; it is a being that has come forth from negativity and inwardness. § 1037 Thus essence appears. Reflection is the showing of illusory being within essence itself. Its determinations areenclosed within the unity simply and solely as posited, sublated determinations; or, reflection is essencewhich, in its positedness, is immediately identical with itself. But since essence is ground, it gives itself a realdetermination through its reflection, which is self−sublating or which returns into itself; further, since thisdetermination, or the otherness, of the ground relation sublates itself in the reflection of the ground andbecomes Existence, this endows the form determinations with an element of self−subsistence. Their illusorybeing completes itself to become Appearance. The essentiality that has advanced to immediacy is, in the first instance, Existence, and an existent or thing−− as an undifferentiated unity of essence with its immediacy. It is true that the thing contains reflection, butits negativity s, in the first instance, extinguished in its immediacy; but because its ground is essentiallyreflection, its immediacy sublates itself and the thing makes itself into positedness. § 1038 Secondly, then, it is Appearance. Appearance is that which the thing is in itself, or its truth. But this merelyposited Existence which is reflected into otherness is equally the transcending of its itself in its infinitude; tothe world of appearance is opposed the world that is reflected into itself, the world of essence. § 1039 But the being that appears and essential being, simply stand in relation to one another. Thus Existence is,thirdly, essential relation; what appears manifests what is essential, and this is in its Appearance. The relation is the still−imperfect union of reflection−into−otherness and reflection−into−self; the perfectinterpenetration of both is actuality.

The thing−in−itself being thus presupposed as theindeterminate, all determination falls outside it into an alien reflection to which it is indifferent. § 1061 For transcendental idealism this external reflection is consciousness. Since this philosophical system placesevery determinateness of things both as regards form and content, in consciousness, the fact that I see theleaves. of a tree not as black but as green, the sun as round and not square, and taste sugar as sweet and notbitter, that I determine the first and second strokes of a clock as successive and not as one beside the other,nor determine the first as cause and the second as effect, and so on, all this is something which, from thisstandpoint, falls in me, the subject. § 1062 This crude presentation of subjective idealism is directly contradicted by the consciousness of freedom,according to which I know myself rather as the universal and undetermined, and separate off from myselfthose manifold and necessary determinations, recognising them as something external for me and belongingonly to things. In this consciousness of its freedom the ego is to itself that true identity reflected into itself,which the thing−in−itself was supposed to be. 1 have shown elsewhere that this transcendental idealism doesnot get away from the limitation of the ego by the object, in general, from the finite world, but only changesthe form of the limitation, which remains for it an absolute, merely giving it a subjective instead of anobjective shape and making into determinatenesses of the ego and into a turbulent whirlpool of change withinit (as if the ego were a thing) that which the ordinary consciousness knows as a manifoldness and alterationbelonging only to things external to it. At present we are considering only the thing−in−itself and thereflection which is in the first instance external to it; this reflection has not yet determined itself toconsciousness, nor the thing−in−itself to ego. We have seen from the nature of the thing−in−itself and ofexternal reflection that this same external reflection determines itself to be the thing−in−itself, or, conversely,becomes the first thing−in−itself's own determination. § 1063 Now the inadequacy of the standpoint at which this philosophy stops short consists essentially in holding fastto the abstract thing−in−itself as an ultimate determination, and in opposing to the thing−in−itself reflectionor the determinateness and manifoldness of the properties; whereas in fact the thing−in−itself essentiallypossesses this external reflection within itself and determines itself to be a thing with its own determinations,a thing endowed with properties, in this way demonstrating the abstraction of the thing as a purething−in−itself to be an untrue determination.

This immediacy is in itself thereflection of essence into itself. Essence, as Existence, has issued from its ground which has itself passed overinto it. Existence is this reflected immediacy in so far as it is in its own self absolute negativity. It is now alsoposited as this in that it has determined itself as Appearance. § 1081 Accordingly Appearance is at first essence in its Existence; essence is immediately present in it. The fact thatit is not immediate but reflected Existence, constitutes the moment of essence in it; or, Existence as essentialExistence is Appearance. § 1082 Something is only Appearance −− in the sense that Existence as such is only a posited being, not a being inand for itself. This constitutes its essentiality, to have within itself the negativity of reflection, the nature ofessence. This is not an alien, external reflection to which essence belongs and which, by comparing essencewith Existence, pronounces the latter to be Appearance. On the contrary, as we have seen, this essentiality ofExistence which constitutes its Appearance, is the truth of Existence itself. The reflection by virtue of whichit is this, is its own. § 1083 But if it is said that something is only Appearance, in the sense that contrasted with it immediate Existence isthe truth, then the fact is that Appearance is the higher truth; for it is Existence as essential Appearance,whereas Existence, on the contrary, is still essenceless Appearance because it contains only the one momentof Appearance, namely, Existence as immediate reflection, not yet as its negative reflection. WhenAppearance is called essenceless, one thinks of the moment of its negativity as though the immediate bycontrast were the positive and the true; but the fact is that this immediate does not as yet contain the essentialtruth. it is when Existence passes over into Appearance that it ceases to be essenceless. § 1084 Essence at first reflects an illusory being [schein] within itself, within its simple identity; as such it is abstractreflection, the pure movement from nothing through nothing back to itself. Essence appears, so that it is nowreal illusory being, since the moments of illusory being have Existence. As we have seen, Appearance is thething as the negative mediation of itself with itself; the differences it contains are self−subsistent matterswhich are the contradiction of being an immediate subsistence and at the same time only in an alienself−subsistence, of therefore having their subsistence in the negation of their own self−subsistence, andagain for that very reason also only in the negation of this alien negation, or in the negation of their ownnegation. Illusory being is the same mediation, but its unstable moments have, in Appearance, the shape ofimmediate self−subsistence. On the other hand, the immediate self−subsistence which belongs to Existenceis, on its part, reduced to a moment. Appearance is accordingly the unity of illusory being and Existence.

But in the Notionas such this totality is the universal−a substrate which is not yet present in the relation of inner and outer. Inthe negative identity of inner and outer which is the immediate conversion of one of these determinations intothe other, there is also lacking that substrate which above was called the fact. § 1153 It is very important to notice that the unmediated identity of form is posited here without the movement of thefact itself, a movement pregnant with content. It occurs in the fact as this is in its beginning. Thus pure beingis immediately nothing. In general, everything real is, in its beginning, such a merely immediate identity; forin its beginning it has not yet opposed and developed its moments; on the one hand it has not yet inwardiseditself out of externality. and on the other hand, it has not yet externalised and brought forth itself, out ofinwardness by its activity.

This makes itself apparent in all natural, scientific and spiritual development generally and it is essential torecognise that because something is at first, only inner or also is in its Notion, the first stage is for that veryreason only its immediate, passive existence. Thus −− to take at once the nearest example −− the essential relation here considered is only implicitly [ansich] the relation, only its Notion, or is at first only internal, before it has moved through the mediation of therelation of force and has realised itself. But for this reason it is only the outer, immediate relation, the relationof whole and parts, in which the sides have a mutually indifferent subsistence. Their identity is not as yet within themselves; it is only internal and the sides therefore fall apart, have animmediate, external subsistence. Thus the sphere of being as such is as yet still the completely inner and istherefore the sphere of simply affirmative [seienden] immediacy or externality. Essence is at first only theinner, and it, too, is for this reason taken as a wholly external, unsystematised, common element; one speaksof public instruction, the press [Schulwesen, Zeitungswesen], and understands thereby something commonformed by an external aggregation of existing objects lacking any essential connection or organisation; or totake concrete objects, the seed of the plant, or the child, is at first only inner plant, internal man. But this iswhy the plant or the man as germ is an immediate, and outer, which has not as yet given itself the negativereference to itself, is something passive, a prey to otherness. Thus God, too, in his immediate Notion is notspirit; spirit is not the immediate, that which is opposed to mediation, but on the contrary is the essence thateternally posits its immediacy and eternally returns out of it into itself. Immediately, therefore God is only nature. Or, nature is only the Inner God, not God actual as spirit, andtherefore not truly God. Or, in our thinking, our first thinking, God is only pure being, or even essence, theabstract absolute, but not God as absolute spirit, which alone is the true nature of God. Transition to Actuality Section Three: Actuality§ 1158 Actuality is the unity of essence and Existence; in it, formless essence and unstable Appearance, or meresubsistence devoid of all determination and unstable manifoldness, have their truth. Existence is, indeed, the immediacy which has proceeded from ground, but form is not as yet posited in it. Indetermining and forming itself it is Appearance; and when this subsistence which is determined only asreflection−into−an−other is developed further into reflection−into−self, it becomes two worlds, two totalitiesof the content, one of which is determined as reflected into itself, the other as reflected into an other. But theessential relation exhibits their form relation, the consummation of which is the relation of inner and outer inwhich the content of both is only one identical substrate and equally only one identity of form. By virtue ofthe fact that this identity is now also identity of form, the form determination of their difference is sublated,and it is posited that they are one absolute totality. § 1159 This unity of inner and outer is absolute actuality. But this actuality is, in the first instance, the absolute assuch −− in so far as it is posited as a unity in which form has sublated itself and made itself into the empty or Science of LogicSection Three: Actuality73"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"outer difference of an outer and inner. Reflection is external in its relation to this absolute, which, it merely contemplates rather than is theabsolute's own movement. But since it is essentially this movement, it is so as the negative return of theabsolute into itself. § 1160 Secondly, we have actuality proper. Actuality, possibility and necessity constitute the formal moments of theabsolute, or its reflection. § 1161 Thirdly, the unity of the absolute and its reflection is the absolute relation, or rather the absolute as relation toitself −− substance. Chapter 1 The AbsoluteA The Exposition of the AbsoluteB The Absolute AttributeC The Mode of the AbsoluteRemark: The Philosophy of Spinoza and LeibnizChapter 2 Actuality§ 1187 The absolute is the unity of inner and outer as initial, implicit unity. The exposition appeared as externalreflection which, on its side, has the immediate before it as something already given, but is at the same timethe movement and relation of this to the absolute, and as such movement leads it back into the absolute anddetermines it as a mere 'way and manner'. But this 'way and manner' is the determination of the absoluteitself, namely, its initial identity or its merely implicit unity. And through this reflection, too, not only is thatinitial in−itself posited as essenceless determination but, since the reflection is negative self−relation, it isthrough this alone that the in−itself becomes this mode. This reflection, as sublating itself in itsdeterminations and in general as the self−returning movement, is first truly absolute identity and at the sametime is the determining of the absolute or its modality. The mode is therefore the externality of the absolute,but equally only as the reflection of the absolute into itself; or it is the absolute's own manifestation, so thatthis manifestation is its reflection−into−self and therefore its being−in−and−for−itself. § 1188 The absolute as such manifestation, the absolute which is nothing else and has no content save that of beingself−manifestation, is absolute form. Actuality is to be taken as this reflected absoluteness. Being is not yetactual: it is the first immediacy; its reflection is therefore a becoming and transition into an other; or itsimmediacy is not being−in−and−for−itself. Actuality also stands higher than Existence. True, Existence is theimmediacy that has proceeded from ground and conditions, or from essence and its reflection. It is thereforein itself what actuality is, real reflection, but it is not yet the posited unity of reflection and immediacy.Existence therefore passes over into appearance in that it develops the reflection which it contains. It is the ground that has fallen to the ground; its determination is the restoration of the ground; thus itbecomes essential relation and its final reflection is the positing of its immediacy as reflection−into−self, and Science of LogicChapter 1 The Absolute74"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"conversely; now this unity in which Existence or immediacy, and the in−itself, the ground or the reflected aresimply moments, is actuality. The actual is therefore manifestation; it is not drawn into the sphere ofalteration by its externality, nor is it the reflecting of itself in an other, but it manifests itself; that is, in itsexternality it is itself and is itself in that alone, namely only as a self−distinguishing and self−determiningmovement. § 1189 Now in actuality as this absolute form, the moments are only as sublated or formal, not yet realised; theirdifference thus belongs at first to external reflection and is not determined as content. § 1190 Actuality as itself the immediate form −− unity of inner and outer is thus in the determination of immediacyover against the determination of reflection−into−self; or it is an actuality as against a possibility. Theirrelation to each other is the third term, the actual determined equally as a being reflected into itself, and thisat the same time as a being existing immediately. This third term is necessity. § 1191 But first of all, since the actual and the possible are formal differences, their relation is likewise merelyformal and consist only in the fact that the one like the other is a positedness, or in contingency. Now since in contingency, the actual as well as the possible is positedness, they have received determinationin themselves; the actual thereby becomes, secondly, real actuality and with it equally emerges realpossibility and relative necessity. Thirdly, the reflection of relative necessity into itself yields absolute necessity, which is absolute possibilityand actuality.

Now, inreciprocity this mechanism is sublated; for it contains first the vanishing of that original persistence of theimmediate substantiality, and secondly the coming−to−be of the cause, and hence originativeness as Science of LogicChapter 3 The Absolute Relation75"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"self−mediating through its negation. § 1273 At first, reciprocity displays itself as a reciprocal causality of presupposed, self−conditioned substances; eachis alike active arid passive substance in relation to the other. Since the two, then, are both passive and active,any distinction between them has already been sublated; the difference is only a completely transparentsemblance; they are substances only inasmuch as they are the identity of the active and the passive.Reciprocity itself is therefore still only an empty mode of representing this; all that is still required is merelyan external bringing together of what is already both in itself and posited. First of all, it is no longer substratesbut substances that stand in relation to each other; in the movement of conditioned causality, the stillremaining presupposed immediacy has been sublated, and the conditioning factor of the causal activity is stillonly the passivity of being acted upon, or the passivity of the cause itself. But further, this 'being acted upon'does not originate in another causal substance, but simply from a causality which is conditioned by beingacted upon, or is a mediated causality. Consequently, this initially external moment which attaches to causeand constitutes the side of its passivity, is mediated by itself, is produced by its own activity, and is thus thepassivity posited by its own activity. Causality is conditioned and conditioning; the conditioning side ispassive, but the conditioned side equally is passive. This conditioning or passivity is the negation of cause bythe cause itself, in that it essentially converts itself into effect and precisely through this is cause. Reciprocityis, therefore, only causality itself; cause not only has an effect, but in the effect it stands, as cause, in relationto itself. § 1274 Causality has hereby returned to its absolute Notion, and at the same time has attained to the Notion itself. Atfirst, it is real necessity; absolute identity with itself, so that the difference of necessity and the relateddeterminations in it are substances, free actualities, over against one another. Necessity is, in this way, inneridentity; causality is the manifestation of this, in which its illusory show of substantial otherness has sublateditself and necessity is raised to freedom. § 1275 In reciprocity, originative causality displays itself as an arising from its negation, from passivity, and as apassing away into the same, as a becoming; but in such a manner that at the same time this becoming isequally only illusory; the transition into an other is a reflection into itself; the negation, which is ground ofthe cause, is its positive union with itself. In reciprocity, therefore, necessity and causality have vanished; they contain both, immediate identity asconnection and relation, and the absolute substantiality of the different sides, hence the absolute contingencyof them;, the original unity of substantial difference, and therefore absolute contradiction. Necessity is being,because it is−the unity of being with itself that has itself for ground; but conversely, because it has a ground itis not being, it is an altogether illusory being, relation or mediation. Causality is this posited transition oforiginative being, of cause, into illusory being or mere positedness, and conversely, of positedness intooriginativeness; but the identity itself of being and illusory being is still an inner necessity. This inwardness or this in−itself, sublates the movement of causality, with the result that the substantiality ofthe sides standing in relation is lost, and necessity unveils itself. Necessity does not become freedom byvanishing, but only because its still inner identity is manifested, a manifestation which is the identical.movement of the different sides within themselves, the reflection of the illusory being as illusory being intoitself. Science of LogicChapter 3 The Absolute Relation76"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Conversely, at the same time, contingency becomes freedom, for the sides of necessity, which have the shapeof independent, free actualities not reflecting themselves in one another, are now posited as an identity, sothat these totalities of reflection−into−self in their difference are now also reflected as identical, or are positedas only one and the same reflection. § 1276 Absolute substance, which as absolute form distinguishes itself from itself, therefore no longer repels itself asnecessity from itself, nor, as contingency, does it fall asunder into indifferent, self−external substances; onthe contrary, it differentiates itself, on the one hand, into the totality −− heretofore passive substance −−which is originative as reflection out of the determinateness into itself, as a simple whole, which containswithin itself its positedness and is posited as self−identical therein−the universal; on the other hand, itdifferentiates itself into the totality −− heretofore causal substance −− into the reflection equally out of thedeterminateness into itself to a negative determinateness which, as thus the self−identical determinateness islikewise posited as the whole, but as self−identical negativity−the individual. But because the universal isself−identical only in that it contains the determinateness within itself as sublated, and therefore the negativeas negative, it is immediately the same negativity which individuality is; and individuality, because it isequally the determinate determinate, the negative as negative, is immediately the same identity whichuniversality is. This their simple identity is particularity, which contains in immediate unity the moment ofdeterminateness of the individual and the moment of reflection−into−self of the universal. These threetotalities are, therefore, one and the same reflection, which, as negative self−relation, differentiates itself intothese two, but into a perfectly transparent difference, namely, into a determinate simplicity or simpledeterminateness which is their one and the same identity. This is the Notion, the realm of subjectivity or of freedom. Subjective Logic or The Doctrine of the NotionForeword § 1277 This part of the logic which contains the Doctrine of the Notion and constitutes the third part of the whole, isalso issued under the particular title System of Subjective Logic, for the convenience of those friends of thisscience who are accustomed to take a greater interest in the matters here treated and included in the scope oflogic commonly so called, than in the further logical topics treated in the first two parts. For these earlierparts I could claim the indulgence of fair−minded critics on account of the scant preliminary studies in thisfield which could have afforded me a support, material, and a guiding thread. In the case of the present part, Imay claim their indulgence rather for the opposite reason; for the logic of the Notion, a completelyready−made and solidified, one may say, ossified material is already to hand, and the problem is to renderthis material fluid and to re−kindle the spontaneity of the Notion in such dead matter. If the building of a newcity in a waste land is attended with difficulties, yet there is no shortage of materials; but the abundance ofmaterials presents all the more obstacles of another kind when the task is to remodel an ancient city, solidlybuilt, and maintained in continuous possession and occupation. Among other things one must resolve to makeno use at all of much material that has hitherto been highly esteemed. § 1278 But above all, the grandeur of the subject matter may be advanced as an excuse for the imperfect execution.For what subject matter can cognition have that is more sublime than truth itself! Yet the doubt whether it is Science of LogicSubjective Logic or The Doctrine of the Notion77"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"not just this subject matter that requires an excuse may occur to us if we recall the sense in which Pilate putthe question, What is truth? In the words of the poet: 'With the courtier's mien that purblind yet smilingcondemns the cause of the earnest soul.' Pilate's question bears the meaning −− which may be regarded as anelement in good manners −− together with a reminder of it, that the aim of attaining truth is, as everyoneknows, something given up and long since set aside, and that the unattainableness of truth is recognised evenamong professional philosophers and logicians. But if the question that religion raises as to the value ofthings, insights, and actions −− a question which in its import has a like meaning −− is once more vindicatingits claims in our days, then philosophy must surely hope that it will no longer be thought so strange if it, too,in its immediate domain once more asserts its true aim, and, after having lapsed into the manner and methodof other sciences and their renunciation of the claim to truth, strives to rise again to that aim. In respect of thisattempt, it is not, strictly speaking, permissible to offer any apology; but in respect of the execution, I mayplead in excuse that my official duties and other personal circumstances allowed me but scattered hours oflabour at a science that demands and deserves undistracted and undivided exertion. Nuremberg, July 21, 1816 The Notion in General § 1279 What the nature of the Notion is, can no more be stated offhand than can the Notion of any other object. Itmight perhaps seem that, in order to state the Notion of an object, the logical element were presupposed andthat therefore this could not in turn have something else for its presupposition, nor be deduced; just as ingeometry logical propositions as applied to magnitude and employed in that science, are premised in the formof axioms, determinations of cognition that have not been and cannot be deduced. Now although it is true thatthe Notion is to be regarded, not merely as a subjective presupposition but as the absolute foundation, yet itcan be so only in so far as it has made itself the foundation. Abstract immediacy is no doubt a first; yet in sofar as it is abstract it is, on the contrary mediated, and therefore if it is to be grasped in its truth its foundationmust first be sought. Hence this foundation, though indeed an immediate, must have made itself immediatethrough the sublation of mediation. § 1280 From this aspect the Notion is to be regarded in the first instance simply as the third to being and essence, tothe immediate and to reflection. Being and essence are so far the moments of its becoming; but it is theirfoundation and truth as the identity in which they are submerged and contained. They are contained in itbecause it is their result, but no longer as being and essence. That determination they possess only in so far asthey have not withdrawn into this their unity. § 1281 Objective logic therefore, which treats of being and essence constitutes properly the genetic exposition of theNotion. More precisely, substance is already real essence, or essence in so far as it is united with being andhas entered into actuality. Consequently, the Notion has substance for its immediate presupposition; what isimplicit in substance is manifested in the Notion. Thus the dialectical movement of substance throughcausality and reciprocity is the immediate genesis of the Notion, the exposition of the process of itsbecoming. But the significance of its becoming, as of every becoming is that it is the reflection of thetransient into its ground and that the at first apparent other into which the former has passed constitutes itstruth. Accordingly the Notion is the truth of substance; and since substance has necessity for its specific modeof relationship, freedom reveals itself as the truth of necessity and as the mode of relationship proper to theNotion. Science of LogicSubjective Logic or The Doctrine of the Notion78"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"§ 1282 The progressive determination of substance necessitated by its own nature, is the positing of what is in andfor itself. Now the Notion is that absolute unity of being and reflection in which being is in and for itself onlyin so far as it is no less reflection or positedness, and positedness is no less being that is in and for itself. Thisabstract result is elucidated by the exposition of its concrete genesis; that exposition contains the nature of theNotion whose treatment it must have preceded. The chief moments of this exposition (which has been givenin detail in the Second Book of the Objective Logic) can therefore only be briefly summarised here. § 1283 Substance is the absolute, the actuality that is in and for itself in itself as the simple identity of possibility andactuality, absolute essence containing all actuality and possibility within itself; and for itself, being thisidentity as absolute power or purely self−related negativity. The movement of substantiality posited by thesemoments consists in the following stages: § 1284 1. Substance, as absolute power or self−related negativity, differentiates itself into a relationship in whichwhat were at first only simple moments are substances and original presuppositions. Their specificrelationship is that of a passive substance, of the original immediacy of the simple inwardness or in−itselfwhich, powerless to posit itself, is only an original positedness and of an active substance, the self−relatednegativity which as such has posited itself in the form of an other and relates itself to this other. This other issimply the passive substance which the active substance through its own originative power has presupposedfor itself as condition. This presupposing is to be understood in the sense that the movement of substanceitself is, in the first instance, under the form of one of the moments of its Notion, the in−itself, and thedeterminateness of one of the substances standing in relationship is also the determinateness of thisrelationship itself. § 1285 2. The other moment is being−for−self, which means that the power posits itself as self−related negativity,thereby sublating again what was presupposed. The active substance is the cause; it acts, that is, it now posits,whereas previously it only presupposed; so that (a) to the power is now added the illusory show of power, tothe positedness the illusory show of positedness. What in the presupposition was original, becomes incausality, through the relation to an other, what it is in itself; the cause produces an effect, and that, too, inanother substance; it is now power in relation to an other and thus appears as a cause, but is a cause only invirtue of this appearing. (b) The effect enters the passive substance, whereby it now also appears as apositedness, but is a passive substance only as such positedness. § 1286 3. But there is still more present in this than only this appearance, namely: (a) the cause acts on the passivesubstance and alters its determination; but this is positedness, there is nothing else in it to alter; the otherdetermination, however, that it receives is causality; the passive substance therefore becomes cause, powerand activity: (b) the effect is posited in it by the cause; but that which is posited by the cause is the causeitself which, in acting, is identical with itself; it is this that puts itself in the place of the passive substance.Similarly, with regard to the active substance, (a) the action is the translation of the cause into the effect, intothe other of the cause, into positedness, and (b) the cause reveals itself in the effect as what it is; the effect isidentical with the cause, is not an other−; thus the cause in acting reveals the posited being as that which thecause essentially is. Each side, therefore, in both its identical and negative relation to the other becomes the Science of LogicSubjective Logic or The Doctrine of the Notion79"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"opposite of itself, so that the other, and therefore also each, remains identical with itself. But the identical andthe negative relations are both one and the same; substance is self−identical only in its opposite and thisconstitutes the absolute identity of the substances posited as a duality. Active substance, through the act ofpositing itself as the opposite of itself, an act which is at the same time the sublating of its presupposedotherness, of passive substance, is manifested as cause or originative substantiality. Conversely, throughbeing acted on, posited being is manifested as posited, the negative as negative, and therefore passivesubstance as self−related negativity, the cause meeting in this other simply and solely with its own self.Through this positing, then, the presupposed or implicit originativeness becomes explicit or for itself; yet thisbeing that is in and for itself is such only in so far as this positing is equally a sublating of what waspresupposed; in other words absolute substance has returned to itself and so become absolute, only out of andin its positedness. Hence this reciprocity is the appearance that again sublates itself, the revelation that theillusory being of causality in which the cause appears as cause, is illusory being. This infinitereflection−into−self, namely, that being is in and for itself only in so far as it is posited, is the consummationof substance. But this consummation is no longer substance itself but something higher, the Notion, thesubject. The transition of the relation of substantiality takes place through its own immanent necessity and isnothing more than the manifestation of itself, that the Notion is its truth, and that freedom is the truth ofnecessity. § 1287 I have already mentioned in the Second Book of the Objective Logic that the philosophy which adopts thestandpoint of substance and stops there is the system of Spinoza. I also indicated there the defect of thatsystem alike as to form and to matter. But the refutation of the system is another matter. With respect to therefutation of a philosophical system I have elsewhere also made the general observation that one must get ridof the erroneous idea of regarding the system as out and out false, as if the true system by contrast were onlyopposed to the false. The context itself in which Spinoza's system here finds mention provides the truestandpoint of the system and the question whether it is true or false. The relation of substance resulted fromthe nature of essence; this relation and its exposition as a developed totality in a system is, therefore, anecessary standpoint assumed by the absolute. Such a standpoint, therefore, is not to be regarded as anopinion, a subjective, arbitrary way of thinking of an individual, as an aberration of speculation; on thecontrary, speculative thinking in the course of its progress finds itself necessarily occupying that standpointand to that extent the system is perfectly true; but it is not the highest standpoint. Yet this does not mean thatthe system can be regarded as false, as requiring and being capable of refutation; on the contrary, the onlything about it to be considered false is its claim to be the highest standpoint. Consequently, the true systemcannot have the relation to it of being merely opposed to it; for if this were so, the system, as this opposite,would itself be one−sided. On the contrary, the true system as the higher, must contain the subordinatesystem within itself. § 1288 Further, the refutation must not come from outside, that is, it must not proceed from assumptions lyingoutside the system in question and inconsistent with it. The system need only refuse to recognise thoseassumptions; the defect is a defect only for him who starts from the requirements and demands based onthose assumptions. Thus it has been said that for anyone who does not presuppose as an established fact the freedom andself−subsistence of the self−conscious subject there cannot be any refutation of Spinozism. Besides, astandpoint so lofty and so intrinsically rich as the relation of substance, far from ignoring those assumptionseven contains them: one of the attributes of Spinoza's substance is thinking. On the contrary, Spinozismknows how to resolve and assimilate the determinations in which these assumptions conflict with it, so thatthey appear in the system, but in the modifications appropriate to it. The nerve, therefore, of the external Science of LogicSubjective Logic or The Doctrine of the Notion80"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"refutation consists solely in clinging stubbornly to the antitheses of these assumptions, for example, to theabsolute self−subsistence of the thinking individual as against the form of thought posited in absolutesubstance as identical with extension. The genuine refutation must penetrate the opponent's stronghold andmeet him on his own ground; no advantage is gained by attacking him somewhere else and defeating himwhere he is not. The only possible refutation of Spinozism must therefore consist, in the first place, inrecognising its standpoint as essential and necessary and then going on to raise that standpoint to the higherone through its own immanent dialectic. The relationship of substance considered simply and solely in itsown intrinsic nature leads on to its opposite, to the Notion. The exposition of substance (contained in the lastbook) which leads on to the Notion is, therefore, the sole and genuine refutation of Spinozism. It is theunveiling of substance, and this is the genesis of the Notion, the chief moments of which have been broughttogether above. The unity of substance is its relation of necessity; but this unity is only an inner necessity; inpositing itself through the moment of absolute negativity it becomes a manifested or posited identity, andthereby the freedom which is the identity of the Notion. The Notion, the totality resulting from the reciprocalrelation, is the unity of the two substances standing in that relation; but in this unity they are now free, forthey no longer possess their identity as something blind, that is to say, as something merely inner; on thecontrary, the substances now have essentially the status of an illusory being, of being moments of reflection,whereby each is no less immediately united with its other or its positedness and each contains its positednesswithin itself, and consequently in its other is posited as simply and solely identical with itself. § 1289 With the Notion, therefore, we have entered the realm of freedom. Freedom belongs to the Notion becausethat identity which, as absolutely determined, constitutes the necessity of substance, is now also sublated or isa positedness, and this positedness as self−related is simply that identity. The mutual opacity of thesubstances standing in the causal relationship has vanished and become a self−transparent clarity, for theoriginality of their self−subsistence has passed into a positedness; the original substance is original in that itis only the cause of itself, and this is substance raised to the freedom of the Notion. § 1290 This at once provides us with a more precise determination of mediately the Notion. Because being that is inand for itself is immediately a positedness, the Notion in its simple self−relation is an absolutedeterminateness which, however, as purely self−related is no less immediately a simple identity. But thisself−relation of the determinateness as the union of itself with itself is equally the negation of thedeterminateness, and the Notion as this equality with itself is the universal. But this identity has equally thedetermination of negativity; it is the negation or determinateness which is self−related; thus the Notion is theindividual. Each of them, the universal and the individual, is the totality, each contains within itself thedetermination of the other and therefore these totalities are one and one only, just as this unity is thedifferentiation of itself into the free illusion of this duality−of a duality which, in the difference of theindividual and the universal, appears as a complete opposition, yet an opposition which is so entirely illusorythat in thinking and enunciating the one, the other also is immediately thought and enunciated. § 1291 The foregoing is to be regarded as the Notion of the Notion. It may seem to differ from what is elsewhereunderstood by 'notion' and in that case we might be asked to indicate how that which we have here found tobe the Notion is contained in other conceptions or explanations. On the one hand, however, there can be noquestion of a confirmation based on the authority of the ordinary understanding of the term; in the science ofthe Notion its content and character can be guaranteed solely by the immanent deduction which contains itsgenesis and which already lies behind us. On the other hand, the Notion as here deduced must, of course, berecognisable in principle in what is elsewhere presented as the concept of the Notion. But it is not so easy to Science of LogicSubjective Logic or The Doctrine of the Notion81"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"discover what others have said about the nature of the Notion. For in the main they do not concernthemselves at all with the question, presupposing that everyone who uses the word automatically knows whatit means. Latterly, one could have felt all the more relieved from any need to trouble about the Notion since,just as it was the fashion for a while to say everything bad about the imagination, and then the memory, so inphilosophy it became the habit some time ago, a habit which in some measure still exists, to heap every kindof slander on the Notion, on what is supreme in thought, while the incomprehensible and non−comprehensionare, on the contrary, regarded as the pinnacle of science and morality. I will confine myself here to a remarkwhich may help one to grasp the notions here developed and may make it easier to find one's bearings inthem. The Notion, when it has developed into a concrete existence that is itself free, is none other than the Ior pure self−consciousness. True, I have notions, that is to say, determinate notions; but the I is the pureNotion itself which, as Notion, has come into existence. When, therefore, reference is made to thefundamental determinations which constitute the nature of the I, we may presuppose that the reference is tosomething familiar, that is, a commonplace of our ordinary thinking. But the I is, first, this pure self−relatedunity, and it is so not immediately but only as making abstraction from all determinateness and content andwithdrawing into the freedom of unrestricted equality with itself. As such it is universality; a unity that isunity with itself only through its negative attitude, which appears as a process of abstraction, and thatconsequently contains all determinedness dissolved in it. Secondly, the I as self−related negativity is no lessimmediately individuality or is absolutely determined, opposing itself to all that is other and excluding it −−individual personality. This absolute universality which is also immediately an absolute individualisation, andan absolutely determined being, which is a pure positedness and is this absolutely determined being it onlythrough its unity with the positedness, this constitutes the nature of the I −− as well as of the Notion; neitherthe one nor the other can be truly comprehended unless the two indicated moments are grasped at the sametime both in their abstraction and also in their perfect unity. § 1292 When one speaks in the ordinary way of the understanding possessed by the I, one understands thereby afaculty or property which stands in the same relation to the I as the property of a thing does to the thing itself,that is, to an indeterminate substrate that is not the genuine ground and the determinant of its property.According to this conception I possess notions and the Notion, just as I also possess a coat, complexion, andother external properties. § 1293 Now Kant went beyond this external relation of the understanding, as the faculty of notions and of the Notionitself, to the I. It is one of the profoundest and truest insights to be found in the Critique of Pure Reason thatthe unity which constitutes the nature of the Notion is recognised as the original synthetic unity ofapperception, as unity of the I think, or of self−consciousness. This proposition constitutes the so−calledtranscendental deduction of the categories; but this has always been regarded as one of the most difficult partsof the Kantian philosophy, doubtless for no other reason than that it demands that we should go beyond themere representation of the relation in which the I stands to the understanding, or notions stand to a thing andits properties and accidents, and advance to the thought of that relation. An object, says Kant, is that in thenotion of which the manifold of a given intuition is unified. But all unifying of representations demands aunity of consciousness in the synthesis of them. Consequently it is this unity of consciousness which aloneconstitutes the connection of the representations with the object and therewith their objective validity and onwhich rests even the possibility of the understanding. Kant distinguishes this unity from the subjective unityof consciousness, the unity of representation whereby I am conscious of a manifold as either simultaneous orsuccessive, this being dependent on empirical conditions. On the other hand, the principles of the objectivedetermination of notions are, he says, to be derived solely from the principle of the transcendental unity ofapperception. Through the categories which are these objective determinations, the manifold of givenrepresentations is so determined as to be brought into the unity of consciousness. According to this Science of LogicSubjective Logic or The Doctrine of the Notion82"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"exposition, the unity of the notion is that whereby something is not a mere mode of feeling, an intuition, oreven a mere representation, but is an object, and this objective unity is the unity of the ego with itself. Inpoint of fact, the comprehension of an object consists in nothing else than that the ego makes it its own,pervades it and brings it into its own form, that is, into the universality that is immediately a determinateness,or a determinateness that is immediately universality. As intuited or even in ordinary conception, the object isstill something external and alien. When it is comprehended, the being−in−and−for−self which it possesses inintuition and pictorial thought is transformed into a positedness; the I in thinking it pervades it. § 1294 But it is only as it is in thought that the object is truly in and for itself; in intuition or ordinary conception it isonly an Appearance. Thought sublates the immediacy with which the object at first confronts us and thusconverts the object into a positedness; but this its positedness is its being−in−and−for−self, or its objectivity.The object therefore has its objectivity in the Notion and this is the unity of self−consciousness into which ithas been received; consequently its objectivity, or the Notion, is itself none other than the nature ofself−consciousness, has no other moments or determinations than the I itself. § 1295 Thus we are justified by a cardinal principle of the Kantian philosophy in referring to the nature of the I inorder to learn what the Notion is. But conversely, it is necessary for this purpose to have grasped the Notionof the I as stated above. If we cling to the mere representation of the I as it floats before our ordinaryconsciousness, then the I is only the simple thing, also called soul, in which the Notion inheres as apossession or property. This representation which makes no attempt to comprehend either the I or the Notioncannot serve to facilitate or bring nearer the comprehension of the Notion. § 1296 The Kantian exposition cited above contains two other features which concern the Notion and necessitatesome further observations In the first place, the stage of the understanding is supposed to be preceded by thestages of feeling and intuition, and it is an essential proposition of the Kantian transcendental philosophy thatwithout intuitions notions are empty and are valid solely as relations of the manifold given by intuition.Secondly, the Notion has been declared to be the objective element of knowledge, and as such, the truth. Buton the other hand, the Notion is taken as something merely subjective from which we cannot extract reality,by which is to be understood objectivity, since reality is contrasted with subjectivity; and, in general, theNotion and the logical element are declared to be something merely formal which, since it abstracts from thecontent, does not contain truth. § 1297 Now, in the first place, as regards the relation of the understanding or the Notion to the stages presupposed byit, the form of these stages is determined by the particular science under consideration. In our science, that ofpure logic, these stages are being and essence. In psychology the antecedent stages are feeling and intuition,and then ideation generally. In the phenomenology of spirit, which is the doctrine of consciousness, theascent to the understanding is through the stages of sensuous consciousness and then perception. Kantpresupposes only feeling and intuition. How incomplete to begin with this scale of stages is is revealed by thefact that he himself adds as an appendix to the transcendental logic or doctrine of the understanding a treatiseon the concepts of reflection a sphere lying between intuition and the understanding or being and the Notion. § 1298 Science of LogicSubjective Logic or The Doctrine of the Notion83"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"About these stages themselves it must be remarked, first of all, that the forms of intuition, ideation and thelike belong to the self−conscious spirit which, as such, does not fall to be considered in the science of logic. Itis true that the pure determinations of being, essence and the Notion constitute the ground plan and the innersimple framework of the forms of the spirit; spirit as intuiting and also as sensuous consciousness is in theform of immediate being; and, similarly, spirit as ideating and as perceiving has risen from being to the stageof essence or reflection. But these concrete forms as little concern the science of logic as do the concreteforms assumed by the logical categories in nature, which would be space and time, then space and timeself−filled with a content as inorganic nature, and lastly, organic nature. § 1299 Similarly here, too, the Notion is to be regarded not as the act of the self−conscious understanding, not as thesubjective understanding, but as the Notion in its own absolute character which constitutes a stage of natureas well as of spirit. Life, or organic nature, is the stage of nature at which the Notion emerges, but as blind, asunaware of itself and unthinking; the Notion that is self−conscious and thinks pertains solely to spirit. But thelogical form of the Notion is independent of its non−spiritual, and also of its spiritual, shapes. The necessarypremonition on this point has already been given in the Introduction. It is a point that must not wait to beestablished within logic itself but must be cleared up before that science is begun. § 1300 Now whatever may be the forms of the stages which precede the Notion, we come secondly to the relation inwhich the Notion is thought to these forms. The conception of this relation both in ordinary psychology andin the Kantian transcendental philosophy is that the empirical material, the manifold of intuition andrepresentation, first exists on its own account, and that then the understanding approaches it, brings unity intoit and by abstraction raises it to the form of universality. The understanding is in this way an intrinsicallyempty form which, on the one hand, obtains a reality through the said given content and, on the other hand,abstracts from that content, that is to say, lets it drop as something useless, but useless only for the Notion. Inboth these actions the Notion is not the independent factor, not the essential and true element of the priorgiven material; on the contrary, it is the material that is regarded as the absolute reality, which cannot beextracted from the Notion. § 1301 Now it must certainly be admitted that the Notion as such is not yet complete, but must rise to the Idea whichalone is the unity of the Notion and reality; and this must be shown in the sequel to be the spontaneousoutcome of the nature of the Notion itself. For the reality which the Notion gives itself must not be receivedby it as something external but must, in accordance with the requirement of the science, be derived from theNotion itself. But the truth is that it is not the material given by intuition and representation that ought to bevindicated as the real in contrast to the Notion. People often say, 'It is only a notion,' contrasting the notionnot only with the Idea but with sensuous, spatial and temporal, palpable reality as something more excellentthan the Notion; and then the abstract is held to be of less account than the concrete because it lacks so muchof this kind of material. In this view, to abstract means to select from the concrete object for our subjectivepurposes this or that mark without thereby detracting from the worth and status of the many other propertiesand features left out of account; on the contrary, these as real retain their validity completely unimpaired,only they are left yonder, on the other side; thus it is only the inability of the understanding to assimilate suchwealth that compels it to content itself with the impoverished abstraction. Now to regard the given material ofintuition and the manifold of representation as the real in contrast to what is thought, to the Notion, is a view,the abandonment of which is not only a condition of philosophising but is already presupposed by religion;for how can there be any need for religion, how can religion have any meaning, if the fleeting and superficialphenomena of the world of sensuous particulars are still regarded as the truth? But philosophy gives a Science of LogicSubjective Logic or The Doctrine of the Notion84"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"reasoned insight into the true state of the case with regard to the reality of sensuous being; it assumes thestages of feeling and intuition as precedent to the understanding in so far as they are conditions of its genesis,but only in the sense that it is conditioned by their reality. Abstract thinking, therefore, is not to be regardedas a mere setting aside of the sensuous material, the reality of which is not thereby impaired; rather is it thesublating and reduction of that material as mere phenomenal appearance to the essential, which is manifestedonly in the Notion. § 1302 Of course, if what is taken up into the Notion from the concrete phenomenon is to serve only as a mark orsign, it certainly may be any mere random sensuous particular determination of the object, selected from theothers on the basis of any random external interest and of a similar kind and nature as the rest. § 1303 A capital misunderstanding which prevails on this point is that the natural principle or the beginning whichforms the starting point in the natural evolution or in the history of the developing individual, is regarded asthe truth, and the first in the Notion. Now in the order of nature, intuition or being are undoubtedly first, orare the condition for the Notion, but they are not on that account the absolutely unconditioned; on thecontrary, their reality is sublated in the Notion and with it, too, the illusory show they possessed of being theconditioning reality. When it is a question, not of truth but merely of history, as in pictorial and phenomenalthinking, we need not of course go beyond merely narrating that we start with feelings and intuitions and thatfrom the manifold of these the understanding extracts a universality or an abstraction and naturally requiresfor this purpose the said substrate of feelings and intuitions which, in this process of abstraction, remains forrepresentation in the same complete reality with which it first presented itself. But philosophy is not meant tobe a narration of happenings but a cognition of what is true in them, and further, on the basis of thiscognition, to comprehend that which, in the narrative, appears as a mere happening. § 1304 If the superficial conception of what the Notion is, leaves all manifoldness outside the Notion and attributesto the latter only the form of abstract universality or the empty identity of reflection, we can at once appeal tothe fact that quite apart from the view here propounded, the statement or definition of a notion expresslyincludes not only the genus, which itself is, properly speaking, more than a purely abstract universality, butalso the specific determinateness. If one would but reflect attentively on the meaning of this fact, one wouldsee that differentiation must be regarded as an equally essential moment of the Notion. Kant has introducedthis consideration by the extremely important thought that there are synthetic judgements a priori. Thisoriginal synthesis of apperception is one of the most profound principles for speculative development; itcontains the beginning of a true apprehension of the nature of the Notion and is completely opposed to thatempty identity or abstract universality which is not within itself a synthesis. The further development,however, does not fulfil the promise of the beginning. The very expression synthesis easily recalls theconception of an external unity and a mere combination of entities that are intrinsically separate. Then, again,the Kantian philosophy has not got beyond the psychological reflex of the Notion and has reverted once moreto the assertion that the Notion is permanently conditioned by a manifold of intuition. It has declaredintellectual cognition and experience to be a phenomenal content, not because the categories themselves areonly finite but, on the ground of a psychological idealism, because they are merely determinations originatingin self−consciousness. It is in keeping with this standpoint, too, that the Notion without the manifold ofintuition is again declared to be empty and devoid of content despite the fact that it is a synthesis a priori; assuch, it surely does contain determinateness and difference within itself. Moreover, since the determinatenessis that of the Notion and therefore absolute determinateness, individuality, the Notion is the ground andsource of all finite determinateness and manifoldness. Science of LogicSubjective Logic or The Doctrine of the Notion85"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"§ 1305 The merely formal position that the Notion holds as understanding is fully confirmed in the Kantianexposition of what reason is. In reason, the highest stage of thought, one ought to have expected the Notion tolose the conditionedness in which it still appears at the stage of understanding and to attain to perfect truth.But this expectation is disappointed. For Kant defines the relation of reason to the categories as merelydialectical and, indeed, takes the result of this dialectic to be the infinite nothing −− just that and nothingmore. § 1306 Consequently, the infinite unity of reason, too, is still deprived of the synthesis, and with it the beginningreferred to above of a speculative, truly infinite Notion; reason becomes the familiar, wholly formal, merelyregulative unity of the systematic employment of the understanding. It is declared to be an abuse when logic,which is supposed to be merely a canon of judgment, is regarded as an organon for the production ofobjective insights. The notions of reason in which we could not but have an intimation of a higher power anda profounder significance, no longer possess a constitutive character as do the categories, they are mere Ideas;certainly, we are quite at liberty to use them, but by these intelligible entities in which all truth should becompletely revealed, we are to understand nothing more than hypotheses, and to ascribe absolute truth tothem would be the height of caprice and foolhardiness, for they do not occur in any experience. Would oneever have thought that philosophy would deny truth to intelligible entities because they lack the spatial andtemporal material of the sensuous world? § 1307 Directly connected with this is the question of the point of view from which the Notion and the character oflogic generally are to be considered, a question on which the Kantian philosophy holds the same view as iscommonly taken: that is to say, in what relation do the Notion and the science of the Notion stand to truthitself. We have already quoted from the Kantian deduction of the categories that according to it the object, asthat in which the manifold of intuition is unified, is this unity solely through the unity of self−consciousness.Here, therefore, the objectivity of thought is specifically enunciated, an identity of Notion and thing, which istruth. In the same way, it is also commonly admitted that when thinking appropriates a given object, thisthereby suffers an alteration and is changed from something sensuous to something thought; and yet that notonly is the essential nature of the object not affected by this alteration but that it is only in its Notion that it isin its truth, whereas in the immediacy in which it is given it is only appearance and a contingency; that thecognition that truly comprehends the object is the cognition of it as it is in and for itself, and that the Notionis its very objectivity. § 1308 But, on the other hand, it is equally maintained that we cannot after all, know things as they truly are inthemselves and that truth is inaccessible to the cognitive powers of reason; that the aforesaid truth whichconsists in the unity of the object and the Notion is, after all, only Appearance, and this time, again on theground that the content is only the manifold of intuition. On this point we have already remarked that, on thecontrary, it is precisely in the Notion that this manifoldness, in so far as it pertains to intuition in contrast tothe Notion, is sublated and that through the Notion the object is reduced to its non−contingent essentialnature. The latter enters into the sphere of Appearance and for that very reason the Appearance is not devoidof essential being, but is a manifestation of essence. But the completely liberated manifestation of essence isthe Notion § 1309 Science of LogicSubjective Logic or The Doctrine of the Notion86"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"These propositions of which we here remind the reader are not dogmatic assertions, for the reason that theyare results that have issued from the entire immanent development of essence. The present standpoint towhich this development has led is that the form of the absolute which is higher than being and essence is theNotion. Regarded from this aspect, the Notion has subjugated being and essence, which from other startingpoints include also feeling and intuition and representation, and which appeared as its antecedent conditions,and has proved itself to be their unconditioned ground. There now remains the second aspect, to the treatmentof which this Third Book of the Logic is devoted, namely the exposition of how the Notion builds up in andfrom itself the reality that has vanished in it. It has therefore been freely admitted that the cognition that stopsshort at the Notion purely as such, is still incomplete and has only as yet arrived at abstract truth. But itsincompleteness does not lie in its lack of that presumptive reality given in feeling and intuition but rather inthe fact that the Notion has not yet given itself a reality of its own, a reality produced from its own resources.The demonstrated absoluteness of the Notion relatively to the material of experience and, more exactly, to thecategories and concepts of reflection, consists in this, that this material as it appears apart from and prior tothe Notion has no truth; this it has solely in its ideality or its identity with the Notion. The derivation of thereal from it if we want to call it derivation, consists in the first place essentially in this, that the Notion in itsformal abstraction reveals itself as incomplete and through its own immanent dialectic passes over intoreality; but it does not fall back again onto a ready−made reality confronting it and take refuge in somethingwhich has shown itself to be the unessential element of Appearance because, having looked around forsomething better, it has failed to find it; on the contrary, it produces the reality from its own resources. It willalways stand out as a marvel how the Kantian philosophy recognised the relation of thought to sensuousreality, beyond which it did not advance, as only a relative relation of mere Appearance, and perfectly wellrecognised and enunciated a higher unity of both in the Idea in general and, for example, in the Idea of anintuitive understanding, and yet stopped short at this relative relation and the assertion that the Notion is andremains utterly separate from reality thus asserting as truth what it declared to be finite cognition, anddenouncing as an unjustified extravagance and a figment of thought what it recognised as truth and of whichit established the specific notion. § 1310 Since it is primarily logic and not science generally with whose relation to truth we are here concerned, itmust further be conceded that logic as the formal science cannot and should not contain that reality which isthe content of the further parts of philosophy, namely, the philosophical sciences of nature and of spirit.These concrete sciences do, of course, present themselves in a more real form of the Idea than logic does; butthis is not by turning back again to the reality abandoned by the consciousness which has risen above itsmode as Appearance to the level of science, nor by reverting to the use of forms such as the categories andconcepts of reflection, whose finitude and untruth have been demonstrated in the logic. On the contrary, logicexhibits the elevation of the Idea to that level from which it becomes the creator of nature and passes over tothe form of a concrete immediacy whose Notion, however, breaks up this shape again in order to realise itselfas concrete spirit. As contrasted with these concrete sciences (although these have and retain as their innerformative principle that same logical element, or the Notion, which had served is their archetype), logic is ofcourse a formal science; but it is the science of the absolute form which is within itself a totality and containsthe pure Idea of truth itself. This absolute form has in its own self its content or reality; the Notion, not beinga trivial, empty identity, possesses in its moment of negativity or of absolute determining, the differentiateddeterminations; the content is simply and solely these determinations of the absolute form and nothing else acontent posited by the absolute form itself and consequently also adequate to it. For this reason, this form isof quite another nature than logical form is ordinarily taken to be. It is already on its own account truth, sincethis content is adequate to its form, or the reality to its Notion; and it is the pure truth because thedeterminations of the content do not yet have the form of an absolute otherness or of absolute immediacy.When Kant, in connection with logic comes to discuss the old and famous question: what is truth? he first ofall presents to the reader as a triviality the explanation of the term as the agreement of cognition with itsobject a definition of great, indeed of supreme, value. If we remember this definition in connection with the Science of LogicSubjective Logic or The Doctrine of the Notion87"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"fundamental assertion of transcendental idealism, that reason as cognitive is incapable of apprehendingthings−in−themselves, that reality lies absolutely outside the Notion, then it is at once evident that a reasonsuch as this which is unable to put itself in agreement with its object, the things−in−themselves, andthings−in−themselves that are not in agreement with the Notion of reason, the Notion that is not in agreementwith reality, and a reality that does not agree with the Notion, are untrue conceptions. If Kant had consideredthe Idea of an intuitive understanding in the light of the above definition of truth, he would have treated thatIdea which expresses the required agreement, not as a figment of thought but rather as the truth. § 1311 'What we require to know' Kant goes on to say, 'is a universal and sure criterion of any cognition whatever; itwould be such a criterion as would be valid for all cognitions without distinction of their objects; but sincewith such a criterion abstraction would be made from all content of the cognition (relation to its object) andtruth concerns precisely this content, it would be quite impossible and absurd to ask for a mark of the truth ofthis content of cognitions.' Here, the usual conception of the formal function of logic is expressed verydefinitely and the argument adduced has a very convincing air. But first of all it is to be observed that itusually happens with such formal ratiocination that it forgets in its discourse the very point on which it hasbased its argument and of which it is speaking. It is alleged that it would be absurd to ask for the criterion ofthe truth of the content of cognition; but according to the definition it is not the content that constitutes thetruth, but the agreement of the content with the Notion. A content such as is here spoken of, without theNotion, is something notionless, and hence without essential being; certainly we cannot ask for the criterionof the truth of such a content, but for the very opposite reason; not, that is, because the content, as somethingnotionless, is not the required agreement, but simply because it cannot be anything more than a mere truthlessopinion. Let us leave on one side the content which causes the confusion here the confusion into whichformalism falls whenever it sets out to explain something and which makes it say the opposite of what itintends and let us stop at the abstract view that logic is only formal and, in fact, abstracts from all content; wethen have a one−sided cognition which is not to contain any object, an empty, blank form which therefore isno more an agreement for an agreement essentially requires two terms then it is truth. In the a priori synthesisof the Notion, Kant possessed a higher principle in which a duality in a unity could be cognised, a cognition,therefore, of what is required for truth; but the material of sense, the manifold of intuition, was too strong forhim and he was unable to get away from it to a consideration of the Notion and the categories in and forthemselves and to a speculative method of philosophising. § 1312 Logic being the science of the absolute form, this formal science, in order to be true, must possess in its ownself a content adequate to its form; and all the more, since the formal element of logic is the pure form, andtherefore the truth of logic must be the pure truth itself. Consequently this formal science must be regarded aspossessing richer determinations and a richer content and as being infinitely more potent in its influence onthe concrete than is usually supposed. The laws of logic by themselves (not counting the heterogeneousaccretions of applied logic and the rest of the psychological and anthropological material) are commonlyrestricted, apart from the law of contradiction, to some meagre propositions concerning the conversion ofjudgements and the forms of syllogisms. Even here the forms which come up for treatment as well as theirfurther modifications are only, as it were, historically taken up; they are not subjected to criticism todetermine whether they are in and for themselves true. Thus, for example, the form of the positive judgementis accepted as something perfectly correct in itself, the question whether such a judgement is true dependingsolely on the content. Whether this form is in its own self a form of truth, whether the proposition itenunciates, the individual is a universal, is not inherently dialectical, is a question that no one thinks ofinvestigating. It is straightway assumed that this judgement is, on its own account, capable of containing truthand that the proposition enunciated by any positive judgement is true, although it is directly evident that itlacks what is required by the definition of truth, namely, the agreement of the Notion and its object; if the Science of LogicSubjective Logic or The Doctrine of the Notion88"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"predicate, which here is the universal, is taken as the Notion, and the subject, which is the individual, is takenas the object, then the one does not agree with the other. But if the abstract universal which is the predicatefalls short of constituting a Notion, for a Notion certainly implies something more, and if, too, a subject ofthis kind is not yet much more than a grammatical one, how should the judgement possibly contain truthseeing that either its Notion and object do not agree, or it lacks both Notion and object? On the contrary, then,what is impossible and absurd is to attempt to grasp the truth in such forms as the positive judgement and thejudgement generally. Just as the Kantian philosophy did not consider the categories in and for themselves butdeclared them to be finite determinations incapable of containing truth, on the wrong ground that they aresubjective forms of self−consciousness, still less did that philosophy subject to criticism the forms of theNotion which are the content of ordinary logic; on the contrary, it has adopted a portion of them, namely, thefunctions of judgement, for the determination of the categories and accepted them as valid presuppositions.Even if we are to see in logical forms nothing more than formal functions of thought, they would for that veryreason be worthy of investigation to ascertain how far, on their own account, they correspond to the truth. Alogic that does not perform this task can at most claim the value of a descriptive natural history of thephenomena of thinking just as they occur. It is an infinite merit of Aristotle, one that must fill us with thehighest admiration for the powers of that genius, that he was the first to undertake this description. It isnecessary however to go further and to ascertain both the systematic connection of these forms and theirvalue. Division § 1313 The foregoing consideration of the Notion shows it to be the unity of being and essence. Essence is the firstnegation of being, which has thereby become illusory being; the Notion is the second negation or thenegation of this negation, and is therefore being once more, but being that has been restored as the infinitemediation and negativity of being within itself. Consequently, being and essence in the Notion no longer havethe same determination that they had as being and essence, nor are they merely in a unity such that each hasan illusory being in the other. Therefore the Notion does not differentiate itself into these determinations. It isthe truth of the relationship of substance in which being and essence achieve the fulfilment of theirself−subsistence and their determination through each other. The truth of substantiality proved to be thesubstantial identity which is no less a positedness and only as such is substantial identity. The positedness is adeterminate being and differentiation; consequently, in the Notion, being−in−and−for−itself has attained atrue and adequate reality, for the positedness is itself being−in−and−for−itself. This positedness constitutesthe difference of the Notion within itself; because the positedness is immediately being−in−and−for−itself,the different moments of the Notion are themselves the whole Notion, universal in their determinateness andidentical with their negation. § 1314 This, now, is the very Notion of the Notion. But it is as yet only its Notion; or, this Notion is itself only theNotion. Because it is equally being−in−and−for−self and also a positedness, or the absolute substance thatmanifests the necessity of distinct substances as an identity, this identity must itself posit what it is. Themoments of the movement of the relationship of substantiality through which the Notion has come to be andthe reality thereby exhibited are still only in transition into the Notion; this reality does not yet possess thedetermination of being the Notion's own, self−evolved determination; it fell in the sphere of necessity; but theNotion's own determination can only be the result of its free determining, a determinate being in which theNotion is identical with itself, its moments also being Notions and posited by the Notion itself. § 1315 Science of LogicSubjective Logic or The Doctrine of the Notion89"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"At first, therefore, the Notion is only in itself or implicitly the truth; because it is only something inner, it isequally only outer. It is at first simply an immediate and in this guise its moments have the form of immediate, fixeddeterminations. It appears as the determinate Notion, as the sphere of the mere understanding. Because thisform of immediacy is still inadequate to the nature of the Notion, for this is free, being in relation only withitself, it is an external form in which the Notion cannot count as a being−in−and−for−self, but only assomething posited or subjective. The Notion in the guise of immediacy constitutes the point of view forwhich the Notion is a subjective thinking, a reflection external to the subject matter. This stage, therefore,constitutes subjectivity, or the formal Notion. Its externality is manifested in the fixed being of itsdeterminations each of which appears independently as an isolated, qualitative something which is onlyexternally related to its other. But the identity of the Notion, which is precisely their inner or subjectiveessence, sets them dialectically in movement, with the result that their separatedness vanishes and with it theseparation of the Notion from the object, and there emerges as their truth the totality which is the objectiveNotion. § 1316 Secondly, the Notion in its objectivity is the subject matter in and for itself. Through its necessary,progressive determination the formal Notion makes itself its subject matter and in this way is rid of therelation of subjectivity and externality to the object. Or, conversely, objectivity is the real Notion that hasemerged from its inwardness and passed over into determinate being. In this identity with the object, theNotion thus has a free determinate being of its own. But this freedom is still only an immediate, not yet anegative, freedom. As one with the object, the Notion is submerged in it; its distinct moments are objectiveexistences in which it is itself again only the inner. As the soul [Seele] of objective reality it must give itselfthe form of subjectivity which, as formal Notion, belonged to it immediately; thus, in the form of the freeNotion, a form which in objectivity it still lacked, it opposes itself to that objectivity and in so doing makesthe identity with it which, as objective Notion it possesses in and for itself, also a posited identity. § 1317 In this consummation in which it has the form of freedom even in its objectivity, the adequate Notion is theIdea. Reason, which is the sphere of the Idea, is the self−revealed truth in which the Notion possesses therealisation that is wholly adequate to it, and is free, inasmuch as it cognises this its objective world in itssubjectivity and its subjectivity in its objective world. Subjectivity − next section The Doctrine of the Notion Section One: Subjectivity§ 1318 The Notion is, in the first instance, formal, the Notion in its beginning or the immediate Notion. In theimmediate unity, its difference or positedness is itself at first simple and only an illusory being [Schein], sothat the moments of the difference are immediately the totality of the Notion and are simply the Notion assuch. § 1319 Secondly, however, because it is absolute negativity, it sunders itself and posits itself as the negative or as the Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion Section One: Subjectivity90"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"other of itself; and further, because as yet it is only the immediate Notion, this positing or differentiation ischaracterised by the fact that the moments become indifferent to one another and each becomes for itself; inthis partition, its unity is still only an external connection. As such connection of its moments, which areposited as self−subsistent and indifferent, it is Judgment. § 1320 Thirdly, though the judgment does contain the unity of the Notion that has vanished into its self−subsistentmoments, yet this unity is not posited. It becomes so through the dialectical movement of the judgment,through which it has become the Syllogism, the Notion posited in its completeness; for in the syllogism thereis posited not only the moments of the Notion as self−subsistent extremes, but also their mediating unity. § 1321 But since this unity itself as the unifying middle, and the moments as self−subsistent extremes, are in the firstinstance immediately opposed to one another, this contradictory relationship that occurs in the formalsyllogism sublates itself, and the completeness of the Notion passes over into the unity of the totality, thesubjectivity of the Notion into its Objectivity. Chapter 1 The Notion§ 1322 Understanding is the term usually employed to express the faculty of notions; as so used, it is distinguishedfrom the faculty of judgment and the faculty of syllogisms, of the formal reason But it is with reason that it isespecially contrasted; in that case, however, it does not signify the faculty of the notion in general, but ofdeterminate notions, and the idea prevails that the notion is only a determinate notion. When theunderstanding in this signification is distinguished from the formal faculty of judgment and from the formalreason, it is to be taken as the faculty of the single determinate notion. For the judgment and the syllogism orreason are, as formal, only a product of the understanding since they stand under the form of the abstractdeterminateness of the Notion. Here, however, the Notion emphatically does not rank as something merelyabstractly determinate; consequently, the understanding is to be distinguished from reason only in the sensethat the former is merely the faculty of the notion in general. § 1323 This universal Notion, which we have now to consider here, contains the three moments: universality,particularity and individuality. The difference and the determinations which the Notion gives itself in itsdistinguishing, constitute the side which was previously called positedness. As this is identical in the Notionwith being−in−and−for−self, each of these moments is no less the whole Notion than it is a determinateNotion and a determination of the Notion. § 1324 In the first instance, it is the pure Notion or the determination of universality. But the pure or universalNotion is also only a determinate or particular Notion, which takes its place alongside other Notions. Becausethe Notion is a totality, and therefore in its universality or pure identical self−relation is essentially adetermining and a distinguishing, it therefore contains within itself the standard by which this form of itsself−identity, in pervading and embracing all the moments, no less immediately determines itself to be onlythe universal over against the distinguishedness of the moments. Science of LogicChapter 1 The Notion91"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Secondly, the Notion is thereby posited as this particular or determinate Notion, distinct from others. Thirdly, individuality is the Notion reflecting itself out of the difference into absolute negativity. This is, atthe same time, the moment in which it has passed out of its identity into its otherness, and becomes thejudgment. A The Universal Notion § 1325 The pure Notion is the absolutely infinite, unconditioned and free. It is here, at the outset of the discussionwhich has the Notion for its content, that we must look back once more at its genesis. Essence is the outcomeof being, and the Notion, the outcome of essence, therefore also of being. But this becoming has thesignificance of a self−repulsion, so that it is rather the outcome which is the unconditioned and original.Being, in its transition into essence, has become an illusory being or a positedness, and becoming ortransition into an other has become a positing; and conversely, the positing or reflection of essence hassublated itself and has restored itself as a being that is not posited, that is original. The Notion is theinterfusion of these moments, namely, qualitative and original being is such only as a positing, only as areturn−into−self, and this pure reflection−into−self is a sheer becoming−other or determinateness which,consequently, is no less an infinite, self−relating determinateness. § 1326 Thus the Notion is, in the first instance, the absolute self−identity that is such only as the negation of negationor as the infinite unity of the negativity with itself. This pure relation of the Notion to itself, which is thisrelation by positing itself through the negativity, is the universality of the Notion. § 1327 As universality is the utterly simple determination, it does not seem capable of any explanation; for anexplanation must concern itself with definitions and distinctions and must apply predicates to its object, andto do this to what is simple, would alter rather than explain it. But the simplicity which constitutes the verynature of the universal is such that, through absolute negativity, it contains within itself difference anddeterminateness in the highest degree. Being is simple as immediate being; for that reason it is onlysomething meant or intended and we cannot say of it what it is; therefore, it is one with its other, withnon−being. Its Notion is just this, to be a simplicity that immediately vanishes in its opposite; it is becoming.The universal, on the contrary, is that simplicity which, because it is the Notion, no less possesses withinitself the richest content. § 1328 First, therefore, it is the simple relation to itself; it is only within itself. Secondly, however, this identity iswithin itself absolute mediation, but it is not something mediated. The universal that is mediated, namely, theabstract universal that is opposed to the particular and the individual, this will be discussed later when we aredealing with the specific notion. Yet even the abstract universal involves this, that in order to obtain it we arerequired to leave out other determinations of the concrete. These determinations, simply as such, arenegations; equally, too, the omitting of them is a negating. So that even with the abstraction, we have thenegation of the negation. But this double negation is conceived of as though it were external to theabstraction, as though not only were the other omitted properties of the concrete distinct from the oneretained, which is the content of the abstract universal, but also as though this operation of omitting the otherproperties and retaining the one were a process outside the properties themselves. To such an externality in Science of LogicChapter 1 The Notion92"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"face of that movement, the universal has not yet determined itself; it is still within itself that absolutemediation which is, precisely, the negation of the negation or absolute negativity. § 1329 By virtue of this original unity it follows, in the first place, that the first negative, or the determination, is nota limitation for the universal which, on the contrary, maintains itself therein and is positively identical withitself. The categories of being were, as Notions, essentially these identities of the determinations withthemselves in their limitation or otherness; but this identity was only in itself the Notion; it was not yetmanifested. Consequently, the qualitative determination as such was lost in its other and had for its truth adetermination distinct from itself. The universal, on the contrary, even when it posits itself in a determination,remains therein what it is. It is the soul [Seele] of the concrete which it indwells, unimpeded and equal toitself in the manifoldness and diversity of the concrete. It is not dragged into the process of becoming, butcontinues itself through that process undisturbed and possesses the power of unalterable, undyingself−preservation. § 1330 But even so, it does not merely show, or have an illusory being, in its other, like the determination ofreflection; this, as a correlate, is not merely self−related but is a positive relating of itself to its other in whichit manifests itself; but, in the first instance, it only shows in it, and this illusory being of each in the other, ortheir reciprocal determining, along with their self−dependence, has the form of an external act. The universal,on the contrary, is posited as the essential being of its determination, as the latter's own positive nature. Forthe determination that constitutes its negative is, in the Notion, simply and solely a positedness; in otherwords, it is, at the same time, essentially only the negative of the negative, and is only as this identity of thenegative with itself, which is the universal. Thus the universal is also the substance of its determinations; butin such wise that what was a contingency for substance, is the Notion's own self−mediation, its ownimmanent reflection. But this mediation which, in the first instance, raises contingency to necessity, is themanifested relation; the Notion is not the abyss of formless substance, or necessity as the inner identity ofthings or states distinct from, and limiting, one another; on the contrary, as absolute negativity, it is the shaperand creator, and because the determination is not a limitation but is just as much utterly sublated, or posited,the illusory being is now manifestation, the manifestation of the identical. § 1331 The universal is therefore free power; it is itself and takes its other within its embrace, but without doingviolence to it; on the contrary, the universal is, in its other, in peaceful communion with itself. We have calledit free power, but it could also be called free love and boundless blessedness, for it bears itself towards itsother as towards its own self; in it, it has returned to itself. § 1332 We have just mentioned determinateness, although the Notion, being as yet only the universal and onlyself−identical, has not yet advanced to that stage. However, we cannot speak of the universal apart fromdeterminateness which to be more precise is particularity and individuality, for the universal, in its absolutenegativity, contains determinateness in and for itself. The determinateness, therefore, is not introduced fromoutside when we speak of it in connection with the universal. As negativity in general or in accordance withthe first, immediate negation, the universal contains determinateness generally as particularity; as the secondnegation, that is, as negation of the negation, it is absolute determinateness or individuality and concreteness.The universal is thus the totality of the Notion; it is a concrete, and far from being empty, it has through itsNotion a content, and a content in which it not only maintains itself but one which is its own and immanent in Science of LogicChapter 1 The Notion93"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"it. We can, indeed, abstract from the content: but in that case we do not obtain the universal of the Notion butonly the abstract universal, which is an isolated, imperfect moment of the Notion and has no truth. § 1333 More precisely, the universal shows itself as this totality as follows. In so far as it contains determinateness, itis not merely the first negation, but also the reflection of this negation into itself. Taken expressly with thisfirst negation, it is a particular, and it is as such that we are soon to consider it; but in this determinateness itis essentially still a universal; this side we have here still to consider. For determinateness, being in theNotion, is the total reflection, the two−fold illusory being which on the one hand has an illusory referenceoutwards, the reflection−into−other, and on the other hand has an illusory reference inwards, thereflection−into−self. The former reflection involves distinction from an other; from this standpoint, theuniversal possesses a particularity which has its resolution in a higher universal. Now even though it ismerely a relative universal, it does not lose its character of universal; it preserves itself in its determinateness,not merely as though in its connection with the determinateness it remained indifferent to it −− for then itwould be merely compounded with it but so that it is what we have just called the illusory reference inwards.The determinateness, as determinate Notion, is bent back into itself out of the externality; it is the Notion'sown immanent character, which is an essential character by virtue of the fact that, in being taken up into theuniversality and pervaded by it, it equally pervades the universality, being of like compass and identical withit; it is the character that belongs to the genus as the determinateness that is not separated from the universal.Accordingly, the limitation is not outward−going but positive, for the Notion, through its universality, standsin free relation to itself. Thus even the determinate Notion remains within itself infinitely free Notion. § 1334 But in regard to the other side, in which the genus is limited by its specific character, it has been observedthat this, as a lower genus, has its resolution in a higher universal. The latter, in its turn, can also be graspedas genus but as a more abstract one; but it always pertains only to that side of the determinate Notion whichhas a reference outwards. The truly higher universal is that in which this outward−going side is taken backinto the universal, the second negation, in which the determinateness is present simply as posited or asillusory being. Life, ego, spirit, absolute Notion, are not universals merely in the sense of higher genera, butare concretes whose determinatenesses, too, are not species or lower genera but genera which, in their reality,are absolutely self−contained and self−fulfilled. In so far as life, ego, finite spirit are, as they certainly are,also only determinate Notions, their absolute resolution is in that universal which as truly absolute Notion isto be grasped as the Idea of infinite spirit, whose posited being is infinite, transparent reality wherein itcontemplates its creation, and in this creation its own self. § 1335 The true, infinite universal which, in itself, is as much particularity as individuality, we have next to consideras particularity. It determines itself freely; the process by which it makes itself finite is not a transition, forthis occurs only in the sphere of being; it is creative power as the absolute negativity which relates itself to itsown self. As such, it differentiates itself internally, and this is a determining, because the differentiation isone with the universality. Accordingly, the universal is a process in which it posits the differences themselvesas universal and self−related. They thereby become fixed, isolated differences. The isolated subsistence of thefinite which earlier was determined as its being−for−self, and also as thinghood, as substance, is, in its truthuniversality, the form with which the infinite Notion clothes its differences −− a form that is, in fact, one ofits own differences. Herein consists the creative power of the Notion, a power which is to be comprehendedonly in this, the Notion's innermost core. B The Particular Notion Science of LogicChapter 1 The Notion94"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"§ 1336 We have seen that the determinateness of the particular is simple as principle, but it is also simple as momentof the totality −− as a determinateness opposed to the other determinateness. The Notion, in determining ordistinguishing itself, is negatively directed against its unity and gives itself the form of one of its idealmoments, that of being: as a determinate Notion, it has a determinate Being in general. But this Being nolonger signifies bare immediacy but Universality −− immediacy which through absolute mediation is equal toitself and equally contains the other moment, essential being or reflection. This Universality with which thedeterminate moment is clothed is abstract Universality. The particular has Universality within it as itsessential being; but, in so far as the determinateness of the difference is posited, and thereby has Being,Universality is a form assumed by the difference, and the determinateness as such is the content. TheUniversality becomes form in so far as the difference is present as the essential moment, just as, on thecontrary, in the purely universal it is present only as absolute negativity, not as difference which posited assuch. © § 1337 Connected with the above is the reason why latterly the Understanding has been so lightly esteemed andranked as inferior to Reason; it is the fixity which it imparts to the determinatenesses, and hence to finitedeterminations. This fixity consists in the form of abstract Universality which has just been considered:through it they become immutable. For qualitative determinateness, and also determinations of reflection, areessentially limited, and, through their limitation, have a relation to their other; hence the necessity oftransition and passing away. But universality which they possess in the understanding gives them the form ofreflection−into−self by which they are freed from the relation−to−other and have become imperishable. Nowthough in the pure Notion this eternity belongs to its nature, yet its abstract determinations are eternalessentialities only in respect of their form; but their content is at variance with this form; therefore they arenot truth, or imperishable. Their content is at variance with the form, because it is not determinateness itselfas universal; that is, it is not totality of the Notion's difference, or not itself the whole form; but the form ofthe limited understanding is itself the imperfect form, namely, abstract universality. But further, we mustrecognise the infinite force of the understanding in splitting the concrete into abstract determinatenesses andplumbing the depth of difference, the force that at the same time is alone the power that effects theirtransition. § 1338 Since, therefore, understanding exhibits the infinite force which determines the universal, or conversely,imparts through the form of Universality a fixity and subsistence to the determinateness that is in and foritself transitory; then it is not the fault of understanding if no further progress is made beyond this point. It isa subjective impotence of reason which adopts these determinatenesses in their fixity, and which is unable tobring them back to their unity through the dialectical force opposed to this abstract universality, in otherwords, through their own peculiar nature or through their Notion. The understanding does indeed give them,so to speak, a rigidity of being such as they do not possess in the sphere of quality and the sphere ofreflection; but at the same time it spiritually impregnates them and so sharpens them, that just at this extremepoint alone they acquire the capability to dissolve themselves and pass over into their opposite. The highestmaturity, the highest stage, which anything can attain is that in which its downfall begins. The fixity of thedeterminateness into which the understanding seems to run, the form of the imperishable, is that ofself−relating universality. But this belongs properly to the Notion; and consequently in this universality is tobe found expressed, and infinitely close at hand, the dissolution of the finite. This Universality directlyrefutes the determinateness of the finite and expresses its incongruity with the universality. Or rather, theadequacy of the finite is already to hand; the abstract determinate is posited as one with the universality, andfor that very reason is posited as not for itself −− for then it would only be a determinate −− but only as unity Science of LogicChapter 1 The Notion95"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"of itself and the universal, that is, as Notion. © C The Individual § 1339 1. In the first instance, therefore, individuality appears as the reflection of the Notion out of itsdeterminateness into itself. It is the self−mediation of the Notion in so far as its otherness has made itself intoan other again, whereby the Notion has reinstated itself as self−identical, but in the determination of absolutenegativity. The negative in the universal whereby this is a particular, was defined above as a two−foldillusory being: in so far as the negative is an illusory being within the universal, the particular remains auniversal; through the reference of the illusory being outwards it is a determinate; the return of this side intothe universal is two−fold: either through abstraction which lets drop the particular and rises to the higher andthe highest genus, or else through the individuality to which the universal in the determinateness itselfdescends. Here is where the false path branches off and abstraction strays from the highway of the Notion andforsakes the truth. Its higher and highest universal to which it raises itself is only the surface, which becomesever more destitute of content; the individuality it despises is the profundity in which the Notion seizes itselfand is posited as Notion. © § 1340 Universality and particularity appeared, on the one hand, as moments of the becoming of individuality. But ithas already been shown that they are in themselves the total Notion, and consequently in individuality do notpass over into an other, but that in individuality there is only posited that they are in and for themselves. Theuniversal is in and for itself because it is in its own self absolute mediation, self−reference only as absolutenegativity. It is an abstract universal in so far as this sublating is an external act and so a dropping of thedeterminateness. § 1341 Life, Spirit, God −− the pure Notion itself, are beyond the grasp of abstraction, because it deprives itsproducts of singularity, of the principle of individuality and personality, and so arrives at nothing butuniversalities devoid of life and spirit, colour and content. § 1342 Yet the unity of the Notion is so indissoluble that even these products of abstraction, though they aresupposed to drop individuality are, on the contrary, individuals themselves. Abstraction raises the concreteinto universality in which, however, the universal is grasped only as a determinate universality; and this isprecisely the individuality that has shown itself to be self−related determinateness. Abstraction, therefore, is asundering of the concrete and an isolating of its determinations; through it only single properties andmoments are seized; for its product must contain what it is itself. But the difference between this individualityof its products and the Notion's individuality is that, in the former, the individual as content and the universalas form are distinct from one another −− just because the former is not present as absolute form, as theNotion itself, or the latter is not present as the totality of form. However this more detailed considerationshows that the abstract product itself is a unity of the individual content and abstract universality, and is,therefore, a concrete −− and the opposite of what it aims to be. § 1343 Science of LogicChapter 1 The Notion96"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"2. But Individuality is not only the return of the Notion into itself; but immediately its loss. Throughindividuality, where the Notion is internal to itself, it becomes external to itself and enters into actuality.Abstraction which, as the soul of individuality is the relation of the negative to the negative; and, as we haveshown not external to the universal and the particular but immanent in them; and through it they are concrete,content, an individual. But as this negativity, individuality is the determinate determinateness, isdifferentiation as such; through this reflection of the difference into itself, the difference becomes fixed; it isonly through individuality that the determining of the particular takes place, for individuality is thatabstraction which simply as individuality, is now posited abstraction. § 1344 The individual, therefore, as self−related negativity, is immediate identity of the negative with itself; it is abeing−for−self. Or it is the abstraction that determines the Notion, according to its ideal moment of being, asan immediate. In this way, the individual is a qualitative one or this. With this quality it is, first, repulsion ofitself from itself, whereby the many other ones are presupposed; secondly, it is now a negative relationtowards these presupposed others; and, the individual is in so far exclusive. § 1345 When one understands by the universal, that which is common to several individuals, one is starting from theindifferent subsistence of these individuals and confounding the immediacy of being with the determinationof the Notion. The lowest possible conception of the universal in its connection with the individual is thisexternal relation of it as merely a common element. © Chapter 2 The Judgment§ 1346 The judgment is the determinateness of the Notion posited in the Notion itself. The Notion's determinations,or what we have seen to be the same thing, the determinate Notions, have already been considered on theirown; but this consideration was more a subjective reflection or subjective abstraction. But the Notion is itselfthis abstractive process, the opposing of its determinations is its own determining activity. The judgment isthis positing of the determinate Notions by the Notion itself. Judging is thus another function thancomprehension, or rather it is the other function of the Notion as the determining of the Notion by itself, andthe further progress of the judgment into the diversity of judgments is the progressive determination of theNotion. What kinds of determinate Notions there are, and how these determinations of the Notion are arrivedat, has to reveal itself in the judgment. § 1347 The judgment can therefore be called the proximate realisation of the Notion, inasmuch as reality denotes ingeneral entry into existence as a determinate being. More precisely, the nature of this realisation haspresented itself in such a manner that, on the one hand, the moments of the Notion through itsreflection−into−self or its individuality are self−subsistent totalities, while on the other hand the unity of theNotion is their relation. The determinations reflected into themselves are determinate totalities, no lessessentially in their indifferent and disconnected subsistence as through their reciprocal mediation with oneanother. The determining itself is only totality in that it contains these totalities and their connection. Thistotality is the judgment. It contains, therefore, first, the two self−subsistents which are called subject andpredicate. What each is cannot yet really be said; they are still indeterminate, for it is only through thejudgment that they are to be determined. The judgment, being the Notion as determinate, the only distinction Science of LogicChapter 2 The Judgment97"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"present is the general one that the judgment contains the determinate Notion over against the stillindeterminate Notion. The subject can therefore, in the first instance, be taken in relation to the predicate asthe individual over against the universal, or even as the particular over against the universal, or as theindividual over against the particular; so far, they confront each other only in general, as the moredeterminate and the more universal. § 1348 It is therefore appropriate and necessary to have these names, subject and predicate for the determinations ofthe judgment; as names, they are something indeterminate that still awaits its determination, and are,therefore, no more than names. It is partly for this reason that the Notion determinations themselves could notbe used for the two sides of the judgment; but a stronger reason is because the nature of the Notiondetermination is emphatically to be, not something abstract and fixed, but to have and to posit its oppositewithin it; since the sides of the judgment are themselves Notions and therefore the totality of itsdeterminations, each side must run through all these determinations and exhibit them within itself, whether inabstract or concrete form. Now in order to fix the sides of the judgment in a general way when theirdetermination is altered, those names are most serviceable which remain the same throughout the alteration.The name however stands over against the matter in hand or the Notion; this distinction presents itself in thejudgment as such; now the subject is in general the determinate, and is therefore more that whichimmediately is, whereas the predicate expresses the universal, the essential nature or the Notion; therefore thesubject as such is, in the first instance, only a kind of name; for what it is is first enunciated by the predicatewhich contains being in the sense of the Notion. In the question: what is this? or: what kind of a plant is this?what is often understood by the being enquired after, is merely the name, and when this is learned one issatisfied and now knows what the thing is. This is being in the sense of the subject. But the Notion, or at leastthe essence and the universal in general, is first given by the predicate, and it is this that is asked for in thesense of the judgment. Consequently, God, spirit, nature, or whatever it may be, is as the subject of ajudgment at first only the name; what such a subject is as regards its Notion is first enunciated in thepredicate. When enquiry is made as to the kind of predicate belonging to such subject, the act of judgmentnecessarily implies an underlying Notion. But this Notion is first enunciated by the predicate itself. Properlyspeaking, therefore, it is the mere general idea that constitutes the presupposed meaning of the subject andthat leads to the naming of it; and in doing this it is contingent and a historical fact, what is, or is not, to beunderstood by a name. So many disputes about whether a predicate does or does not belong to a certainsubject are therefore nothing more than verbal disputes, because they start from the form above mentioned;what lies at the base is so far nothing more than the name. § 1349 We have now to examine, secondly, how the relation of subject and predicate in the judgment is determinedand how subject and predicate themselves are at first determined through this very relation. The judgment hasin general for its sides totalities which to begin with are essentially self−subsistent. The unity of the Notion is,therefore, at first only a relation of self−subsistents; not as yet the concrete and pregnant unity that hasreturned into itself from this reality, but only a unity outside which the self−subsistent sides persist asextremes that are not sublated in it. Now consideration of the judgment can begin from the original unity ofthe Notion, or from the self−subsistence of the extremes. The judgment is the self−diremption of the Notion;this unity is, therefore, the ground from which the consideration of the judgment in accordance with its trueobjectivity begins. It is thus the original division [Teilung] of what is originally one; thus the word Urteilrefers to what judgment is in and for itself. But regarded from the side of externality, the Notion is present inthe judgment as Appearance, since its moments therein attain self−subsistence, and it is on this external sidethat ordinary thinking tends to fasten. § 1350 Science of LogicChapter 2 The Judgment98"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"From this subjective standpoint, then, subject and predicate are considered to be complete, each on its ownaccount, apart from the other: the subject as an object that would exist even if it did not possess this predicate;the predicate as a universal determination that would exist even if it did not belong to this subject. From thisstandpoint, the act of judgment involves the reflection, whether this or that predicate which is in someone'shead can and should be attached to the object which exists on its own account outside; the very act of judgingconsists in this, that only through it is a predicate combined with a subject, so that, if this combination did nottake place, each on its own would still remain what it is, the latter an existent object, the former an idea insomeone's head. The predicate which is attached to the subject should, however, also belong to it, that is, bein and for itself identical with it. Through this significance of attachment, the subjective meaning of judgmentand the indifferent, outer subsistence of subject and predicate are sublated again: this action is good; thecopula indicates that the predicate belongs to the being of the subject and is not merely externally combinedwith it. In the grammatical sense, that subjective relationship in which one starts from the indifferentexternality of the subject and predicate has its complete validity; for it is words that are here externallycombined. We may take this opportunity of remarking, too, that though a proposition has a subject andpredicate in the grammatical sense, this does not make it a judgment. The latter requires that the predicate berelated to the subject as one Notion determination to another, and therefore as a universal to a particular orindividual. If a statement about a particular subject only enunciates something individual, then this is a mereproposition, For example, 'Aristotle died at the age of 73, in the fourth year of the 115th Olympiad,' is a mereproposition, not a judgment. It would partake of the nature of a judgment only if doubt had been thrown onone of the circumstances, the date of the death, or the age of that philosopher, and the given figures had beenasserted on the strength of some reason or other. In that case, these figures would be taken as somethinguniversal, as time that still subsists apart from this particular content of the death of Aristotle, whether as timefilled with some other content, or even as empty time. Similarly, the news that my friend N. has died is aproposition; and it would be a judgment only if there were a question whether he was really dead or only in astate of catalepsy. § 1351 In the usual way of defining the judgment we may indeed accept the indeterminate expression connection forthe external copula, as also that the connected terms are at least supposed to be notions. But in other respectsthis definition is superficial in the extreme: not only, for example, that in the disjunctive judgment more thantwo so−called notions are connected, but rather that the definition is far better than its subject matter; for it isnot notions at all that are meant, hardly determinations of the Notion, but really only determinations ofrepresentational thought; it was remarked in connection with the Notion in general and the determinateNotion, that what is usually so named by no means deserves the name of Notion; where then should Notionscome from in the case of the judgment? Above all, in this definition the essential feature of the judgment,namely, the difference of its determinations, is passed over; still less does it take into account the relationshipof the judgment to the Notion. § 1352 As regards the further determination of the subject and predicate, we have remarked that it is really in thejudgment first that they have to receive their determination. Since the judgment is the posited determinatenessof the Notion, this determinateness possesses the said differences immediately and abstractly as individualityand universality. But in so far as the judgment is in general the determinate being or otherness of the Notionwhich has not yet restored itself to the unity whereby it is as Notion, there emerges also−the determinatenesswhich is notionless, the opposition of being and reflection or the in−itself. But since the Notion constitutesthe essential ground of the judgment, these determinations are at least indifferent to the extent that when onebelongs to the subject and the other to the predicate, the converse relationship equally holds good. Thesubject as the individual appears, in the first instance, as that which simply is or is for itself in accordancewith the specific determinateness of the individual −− as an actual object, even though it be only an object in Science of LogicChapter 2 The Judgment99"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"representational thought −− as for example bravery, right, agreement, etc. −− on which judgment is beingmade. The predicate, on the other hand, as the universal, appears as this reflection on the object, or rather asthe object's reflection into itself, which goes beyond that immediacy and sublates the determinatenesses intheir form of mere being; that is, it is the object's in−itself. In this way, one starts from the individual as thefirst, the immediate, and it is raised by the judgment into universality, just as, conversely, the universal that isonly in itself descends in the individual into determinate being or becomes a being that is for itself. § 1353 This signification of the judgment is to be taken as its objective meaning, and at the same time as the truth ofthe earlier forms of the transition. In the sphere of being, the object becomes and others itself, the finiteperishes or goes under in the infinite; in the sphere of Existence, the object issues from its ground intoAppearance and falls to the ground, the accident manifests the wealth of substance as well as its power; inbeing, there is transition into an other, in essence, reflected being in an other by which the necessary relationis revealed. This movement of transition and reflection has now passed over into the original partition of theNotion which, while bringing back the individual to the in−itself of its universality, equally determines theuniversal as something actual. These two acts are one and the same process in which individuality is positedin its reflection−into−self, and the universal as determinate. § 1354 But now this objective signification equally implies that the said differences, in reappearing in thedeterminateness of the Notion, are at the same time posited only as Appearances, that is, that they are notanything fixed, but apply just as much to the one Notion determination as to the other. The subject is,therefore, just as much to be taken as the in−itself, and the predicate, on the other hand, as determinate being.The subject without predicate is what the thing without qualities, the thing−in−itself is in the sphere ofAppearance −− an empty, indeterminate ground; as such, it is the Notion enclosed within itself, which onlyreceives a differentiation and determinateness in the predicate; the predicate therefore constitutes the side ofthe determinate being of the subject. Through this determinate universality the subject stands in relation to anexternality, is open to the influence of other things and thereby becomes actively opposed to them. What isthere comes forth from its being−within−self and enters into the universal element of connection andrelationship, into the negative connections and the interplay of actuality, which is a continuation of theindividual into other individuals and therefore universality. § 1355 The identity just demonstrated, namely, that the determination of the subject equally applies to the predicateand vice versa, is not, however, something only for us; it is not merely in itself, but is also posited in thejudgment; for the judgment is the connection of the two; the copula expresses that the subject is the predicate.The subject is the specific determinateness, and the predicate is this posited determinateness of the subject;the subject is determined only in its predicate, or, only in the predicate is it a subject; in the predicate it hasreturned into itself and is therein the universal. Now in so far as the subject is the self−subsistent, this identityhas the relationship that the predicate does not possess a self−subsistence of its own, but has its subsistenceonly in the subject; it inheres in the subject. Since the predicate is thus distinct from the subject, it is only anisolated determinateness of the latter, only one of its properties; while the subject itself is the concrete, thetotality of manifold determinatenesses, just as the predicate contains one; it is the universal. § 1356 But on the other hand the predicate, too, is a self−subsistent universality and the subject, conversely, only adetermination of it. Looked at this way, the predicate subsumes the subject; individuality and particularity are Science of LogicChapter 2 The Judgment100"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"not for themselves, but have their essence and substance in the universal. The predicate expresses the subjectin its Notion; the individual and the particular are contingent determinations in the subject; it is their absolutepossibility. When in the case of subsumption one thinks of an external connection of subject and predicateand the subject is conceived of as a self−subsistent something, the subsumption refers to the subjective act ofjudgment above−mentioned in which one starts from the self−subsistence of both subject and predicate. Fromthis standpoint subsumption is only the application of the universal to a particular or an individual, which isplaced under the universal in accordance with a vague idea that it is of inferior quality. § 1357 When the identity of subject and predicate are so taken that at one time one Notion determination applies tothe former and the other to the latter, and at another time the converse equally holds good, then the identity isas yet still only an implicit one; on account of the self−subsistent diversity of the two sides of the judgment,their posited unity also has these two sides, in the first instance as different. But differenceless identity reallyconstitutes the true relation of the subject to the predicate. The Notion determination is itself essentiallyrelation for it is a universal; therefore the same determinations possessed by the subject and predicate are alsopossessed by their relation itself. The relation is universal, for it is the positive identity of the two, of subjectand predicate; but it is also determinate, for the determinateness of the predicate is that of the subject; further,it is also individual, for in it the self−subsistent extremes are sublated as in their negative unity. However, inthe judgment this identity is not as yet posited; the copula is present as the still indeterminate relation ofbeing as such: A is B; for in the judgment, the self−subsistence of the Notion determinatenesses or theextremes, is the reality which the Notion has within it. If the is of the copula were already posited as theabove determinate and pregnant unity of subject and predicate, as their Notion, it would already be thesyllogism. § 1358 To restore this identity of the Notion, or rather to posit it, is the goal of the movement of the judgment. Whatis already present in the judgment is, on the one hand, the self−subsistence of subject and predicate, but alsotheir mutually opposed determinateness, and on the other hand their none the less abstract relation. What thejudgment enunciates to start with is that the subject is the predicate; but since the predicate is supposed not tobe what the subject is, we are faced with a contradiction which must resolve itself, pass over into a result. Orrather, since subject and predicate are in and for themselves the totality of the Notion, and the judgment is thereality of the Notion, its forward movement is only a development; there is already present in it what comesforth from it, so that proof is merely an exposition, a reflection as a positing of that which is already presentin the extremes of the judgment; but even this positing itself is already present; it is the relation of theextremes. § 1359 The judgment in its immediacy is in the first instance the judgment of existence; its subject is immediately anabstract individual which simply is, and the predicate is an immediate determinateness or property of thesubject, an abstract universal. This qualitative character of subject and predicate being sublated, the determination of the one is reflected, tobegin with, in the other; the judgment is now, secondly, the judgment of reflection. But this more external conjunction passes over into the essential identity of a substantial, necessaryconnection; as such it is, thirdly, the judgment of necessity. Science of LogicChapter 2 The Judgment101"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Fourthly, since in this essential identity the difference of subject and predicate has become a form, thejudgment becomes subjective; it contains the opposition of the Notion and its reality and the equation of thetwo; it is the judgment of the Notion. This emergence of the Notion establishes the transition of the Judgment into the syllogism. A. THE JUDGMENT OF EXISTENCE § 1360 In the subjective judgment we want to see one and the same object double, first in its individual actuality, andthen in its essential identity or in its Notion: the individual raised into its universality, or, what is the samething, the universal individualised into its actuality. In this way the judgment is truth: for it is the agreementof the Notion and reality. But this is not the nature of the judgment at first; for at first it is immediate, since asyet no reflection and movement of the determinations has appeared in it. This immediacy makes the firstjudgment a judgment of existence; it can also be called the qualitative judgment, but only in so far as qualitydoes not apply only to the determinateness of being but also includes the abstract universality which, onaccount of its simplicity, likewise has the form of immediacy. § 1361 The judgment of existence is also the judgment of inherence; because it is in the form of immediacy, andbecause the subject as distinguished from the predicate is the immediate, and consequently the primary andessential feature in a judgment of this kind, the predicate has the form of a non−self−subsistent determinationthat has its foundation in the subject. (a) The Positive Judgment(b) The Negative Judgment(c) The Infinite JudgmentB. THE JUDGMENT OF REFLECTION § 1387 In the judgment that has now arisen, the subject is an individual as such; and similarly the universal is nolonger an abstract universality or a single property, but is posited as a universal that has gathered itselftogether into a unity through the relation of distinct terms; or, regarding it from the point of view of thecontent of various determinations in general, as the taking together of various properties and existences. Ifexamples are to be given of predicates of judgments of reflection, they must be of another kind than forjudgments of existence. It is in the judgment of reflection that we first have, strictly speaking, a determinatecontent, that is, a content as such; for the content is the form determination which is reflected into identity asdistinct from the form in so far as this is a distinct determinateness −− as it still is in the judgment. In thejudgment of existence the content is merely an immediate, or abstract, indeterminate content. The followingmay therefore serve as examples of judgments of reflection: man is mortal, things are perishable, this thing isuseful, harmful; hardness, elasticity of bodies, happiness, etc. are predicates of this peculiar kind. Theyexpress an essential determination, but one which is in a relationship or is a unifying universality. § 1388 This universality, which will further determine itself in the movement of the judgment of reflection, is stilldistinct from the universality of the Notion as such; true, it is no longer the abstract universality of the Science of LogicChapter 2 The Judgment102"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"qualitative judgment, but it still possesses a relation to the immediate from which it proceeds and has thelatter as the basis of its negativity. The Notion determines the existent, in the first instance, to determinationsof relation, to self−continuities in the diverse multiplicity of concrete existence−yet in such a manner that thegenuine universal, though it is the inner essence of that multiplicity, is still in the sphere of Appearance, andthis relative nature−or even the mark−of this multiplicity is still not the moment of being−in−and−for−self ofthe latter. § 1389 It may suggest itself to define the judgment of reflection as a judgment of quantity, just as the judgment ofexistence was also defined as qualitative judgment. But just as immediacy in the latter was not merely animmediacy which simply is, but one which was essentially also mediated and abstract, so here, too, thatsublated immediacy is not merely sublated quality, and therefore not merely quantity; on the contrary, just asquality is the most external immediacy, so is quantity, in the same way, the most external determinationbelonging to mediation. § 1390 Further, as regards the determination as it appears in its movement in the judgment of reflection, it should beremarked that in the judgment of existence the movement of the determination showed itself in the predicate,because this judgment was in the determination of immediacy and the subject consequently appeared as thebasis. For a similar reason, in the judgment of reflection, the onward movement of determining runs itscourse in the subject, because this judgment has for its determination the reflected in−itself. Here thereforethe essential element is the universal or the predicate; hence it constitutes the basis by which, and inaccordance with which, the subject is to be measured and determined. However, the predicate also receives afurther determination through the further development of the form of the subject; but this occurs indirectly,whereas the development of the subject is, for the reason stated, a direct advance. § 1391 As regards the objective signification of the judgment, the individual, through its universality, enters intoexistence, but in an essential determination of relationship, in an essentiality which maintains itselfthroughout the multiplicity of the world of Appearance; the subject is supposed to be determinate in and foritself; this determinateness it possesses in its predicate. The individual, on the other hand, is reflected into thisits predicate which is its universal essence; the subject is in so far a concrete existence in the world ofAppearance. The predicate in this judgment no longer inheres in the subject; it is rather the implicit beingunder which this individual is subsumed as an accidental. If the judgments of existence may also be definedas judgments of inherence, judgments of reflection are, on the contrary, judgments of subsumption. (a) The Singular Judgment(b) The Particular Judgment(c) The Universal JudgmentC. THE JUDGMENT OF NECESSITY § 1405 The determination to which universality has advanced is, as we have seen, the universality which is in and foritself or objective, to which in the sphere of essence substantiality corresponds. It is distinguished from thelatter in that it belongs to the Notion and is therefore not merely the inner but also the posited necessity of itsdeterminations; or, in other words, the difference is immanent in it, whereas substance has its difference only Science of LogicChapter 2 The Judgment103"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"in its accidents, but not as principle within itself. § 1406 Now in the judgment, this objective universality is posited; first, therefore, with this its essentialdeterminateness as immanent in it, secondly, with its determinateness distinguished from it as particularity, ofwhich this universality constitutes the substantial basis. In this way it is determined as genus and species. (a) The Categorical Judgment(b) The Hypothetical Judgment(c) The Disjunctive JudgmentD. THE JUDGMENT OF THE NOTION§ 1417 The ability to form judgments of existence such as 'the rose is red', 'snow is white', and so forth, will hardlycount as evidence of great powers of judgment. The judgments of reflection are rather propositions; in thejudgment of necessity the object appears, it is true, in its objective universality, but it is only in the judgmentnow to be considered that its relation to the Notion is found. In this judgment the Notion is laid down as thebasis, and since it is in relation to the object, it is an ought−to−be to which the reality may or may not beadequate. Therefore it is only a judgment of this kind that contains a true appreciation; the predicates good,bad, true, beautiful, correct, etc. express that the thing is measured against its universal Notion as the simplypresupposed ought−to−be and is, or is not, in agreement with it. § 1418 The judgment of the Notion has been called the judgment of modality and it has been regarded as containingthat form of the relationship between subject and predicate which is found in an external understanding, andto be concerned with the value of the copula only in relation to thinking. § 1419 According to this view, the problematical judgment is one where the affirmation or denial is taken as optionalor possible; the assertoric, where it is taken as true, that is as actual; and the apodeictic, where it is taken asnecessary. It is easy to see why it is so natural in the case of this judgment to step out of the sphere ofjudgment itself and to regard its determination as something merely subjective. For here it is the Notion, orthe subjective, that reappears in the judgment and stands in relationship to an external actuality. But thissubjectivity is not to be confused with external reflection, which of course is also something subjective, but ina different sense from the Notion itself; on the contrary, the Notion that re−emerges from the disjunctivejudgment is the opposite of a mere contingent mode. The earlier judgments are in this sense merelysubjective, for they are based on an abstraction and one−sidedness in which the Notion is lost. The judgmentof the Notion, on the contrary, is objective and the truth as against those earlier judgments, just because it hasfor its basis the Notion, not the Notion in external reflection or in relation to a subjective, that is contingent,thinking, but the Notion in its determinateness as Notion. § 1420 In the disjunctive judgment the Notion was posited as identity of the universal nature with itsparticularisation; consequently the relation of the judgment was cancelled. This concretion of universality andparticularisation is, at first, a simple result; it has now to develop itself further into totality, since the momentswhich it contains are at first swallowed up in it and as yet do not confront one another in determinateself−subsistence. The defect of the result may also be more definitely expressed by saying that in the Science of LogicChapter 2 The Judgment104"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"disjunctive judgment, although objective universality has completed itself in its particularisation, yet thenegative unity of the latter merely returns into the former and has not yet determined itself to the thirdmoment, that of individuality. Yet in so far as the result itself is negative unity, it is indeed already thisindividuality; but as such it is only this one determinateness, which has now to posit its negativity, sunderitself into the extremes and in this way finally develop into the syllogism. § 1421 The proximate diremption of this unity is the judgment in which it is posited first as subject, as an immediateindividual, and then as predicate, as the determinate relation of its moments. (a) The Assertoric Judgment(b) The Problematic Judgment(c) The Apodetic Judgment§ 1431 This judgment, then, is truly objective; or it is the truth of the judgment in general. Subject and predicatecorrespond to each other and have the same content, and this content is itself the posited concreteuniversality; it contains, namely, the two moments, the objective universal or the enus, and the individualiseduniversal. Here, therefore, we have the universal which is itself and continues itself through its opposite andis a universal only as unity with this opposite. A universal of this kind, such as the predicate good, suitable,correct, etc., is based on an ought−to−be and at the same time contains the correspondence of existence tothat ought−to−be; it is not this ought−to−be or the genus by itself, but this correspondence that is theuniversality which constitutes the predicate of the apodeictic judgment. § 1432 The subject likewise contains these two moments in immediate unity as the fact. But it is the truth of the factthat it is internally split into what it ought−to−be and what it is; this is the absolute judgment on all actuality.It is because this original partition, which is the omnipotence of the Notion, is just as much a return into itsunity and an absolute relation of the ought−to−be and being to each other that makes what is actual into afact; its inner relation, this concrete identity, constitutes the soul of the fact. § 1433 The transition from the immediate simplicity of the fact to the correspondence which is the determinaterelation of its ought−to−be and its being −− or the copula −− is now seen, on closer examination, to lie in theparticular determinateness of the fact. The genus is the universal in and for itself, which as such appears asthe unrelated; while the determinateness is that which in that universal is reflected into itself, yet at the sametime is reflected into an other. The judgment therefore has its ground in the constitution of the subject andthereby is apodeictic. Hence we now have before us the determinate and fulfilled copula, which formerlyconsisted in the abstract 'is', but has now further developed itself into ground in general. It appears at first asan immediate determinateness in the subject, but it is no less the relation to the predicate which has no othercontent than this very correspondence, or the relation of the subject to the universality. § 1434 Thus the form of the judgment has perished; first because subject and predicate are in themselves the samecontent; secondly because the subject through its determinateness points beyond itself and relates itself to thepredicate; but also, thirdly, this relating has passed over into the predicate, alone. constitutes its content, and Science of LogicChapter 2 The Judgment105"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"is thus the posited relation, or the judgment itself. Thus the concrete identity of the Notion which was theresult of the disjunctive judgment and which constitutes the inner basis of the Notion judgment −− whichidentity was at first posited only in the predicate −− is now restored in the whole. § 1435 If we examine the positive element of this result which effects the transition of the judgment into anotherform, we find, as we have seen, that subject and predicate in the apodeictic judgment are each the wholeNotion. The unity of the Notion as the determinateness constituting the copula that relates them, is at thesame time distinct from them. At first, it stands only on the other side of the subject as the latter's immediateconstitution. But since it is essentially that which relates subject and predicate, it is not merely suchimmediate constitution but the universal that permeates both subject and predicate. While subject andpredicate have the same content, the form relation, on the other hand, is posited through this determinateness,determinateness as a universal or particularity. Thus it contains within itself the two form determinations ofthe extremes and is the determinate relation of subject and predicate; it is the fulfilled copula of the judgment,the copula pregnant with content, the unity of the Notion that has re−emerged from the judgment in which itwas lost in the extremes. Through this impregnation of the copula the judgment has become the syllogism. The Doctrine of the Notion−−Section One: SubjectivityChapter 3 The Syllogism§ 1436 We have found the syllogism to be the restoration of the Notion in the judgment, and consequently the unityand truth of both. The Notion as such holds its moments sublated in unity; in the judgment this unity isinternal or, what is the same thing, external; and the moments, although related, are posited as self−subsistentextremes. In the syllogism the Notion determinations are like the extremes of the judgment, and at the sametime their determinate unity is posited. § 1437 Thus the syllogism is the completely posited Notion; it is therefore the rational. The understanding isregarded as the faculty of the determinate Notion which is held fast in isolation by abstraction and the form ofuniversality. But in reason the determinate Notions are posited in their totality and unity. Therefore, not onlyis the syllogism rational, but everything rational is a syllogism. The syllogistic process has for a long timebeen ascribed to reason; yet on the other hand reason in and for itself, rational principles and laws, are spokenof in such a way that it is not clear what is the connection between the former reason which syllogises and thelatter reason which is the source of laws and other eternal truths and absolute thoughts. If the former issupposed to be merely formal reason, while the latter is supposed to be creative of content, then according tothis distinction it is precisely the form of reason, the syllogism, that must not be lacking in the latter.Nevertheless, to such a degree are the two commonly held apart, and not mentioned together, that it seems asthough the reason of absolute thoughts was ashamed of the reason of the syllogism and as though it was onlyin deference to tradition that the syllogism was also adduced as an activity of reason. Yet it is obvious, as wehave just remarked, that the logical reason, if it is regarded as formal reason, must essentially be recognisablealso in the reason that is concerned with a content; the fact is that no content can be rational except throughthe rational form. In this matter we cannot look for any help in the common chatter about reason; for thisrefrains from stating what is to be understood by reason; this supposedly rational cognition is mostly so busywith its objects that it forgets to cognise reason itself and only distinguishes and characterises it by the objectsthat it possesses. If reason is supposed to be the cognition that knows about God, freedom, right and duty, the Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion−−Section One: Subjectivity106"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"infinite, unconditioned, supersensuous, or even gives only ideas and feelings of these objects, then for onething these latter are only negative objects, and for another thing the first question still remains, what it is inall these objects that makes them rational. It is this, that the infinitude of these objects is not the emptyabstraction from the finite, not the universality that lacks content and determinateness, but the universalitythat is fulfilled or realised, the Notion that is determinate and possesses its determinateness in this true way,namely, that it differentiates itself within itself and is the unity of these fixed and determinate differences. Itis only thus that reason rises above the finite, conditioned, sensuous, call it what you will, and in thisnegativity is essentially pregnant with content, for it is the unity of determinate extremes; as such, however,the rational is nothing but the syllogism. § 1438 Now the syllogism, like the judgment, is in the first instance immediate; hence its determinations are simple,abstract determinatenesses; in this form it is the syllogism of the understanding. If we stop short at this formof the syllogism, then the rationality in it, although undoubtedly present and posited, is not apparent. Theessential feature of the syllogism is the unity of the extremes, the middle term which unites them, and theground which supports them. Abstraction, in holding rigidly to the self−subsistence of the extremes, opposesthis unity to them as a determinateness which likewise is fixed and self−subsistent, and in this wayapprehends it rather as non−unity than as unity. The expression middle term is taken from spatialrepresentation and contributes its share to the stopping short at the mutual externality of the terms. Now if thesyllogism consists in the unity of the extremes being posited in it, and if, all the same, this unity is simplytaken on the one hand as a particular on its own, and on the other hand as a merely external relation, andnon−unity is made the essential relationship of the syllogism, then the reason which constitutes the syllogismcontributes nothing to rationality. § 1439 First, the syllogism of existence in which the terms are thus immediately and abstractly determined,demonstrates in itself (since, like the judgment, it is their relation) that they are not in fact such abstractterms, but that each contains the relation to the other and that the middle term is not particularity as opposedto the determinations of the extremes but contains these terms posited in it. § 1440 Through this its dialectic it is converted into the syllogism of reflection, into the second syllogism. The termsof this are such that each essentially shows in, or is reflected into, the other; in other words they are posited asmediated, which they are supposed to be in accordance with the nature of the syllogism in general. § 1441 Thirdly, in that this reflecting or mediatedness of the extremes is reflected into itself, the syllogism isdetermined as the syllogism of necessity, in which the mediating element is the objective nature of the thing.As this syllogism determines the extremes of the Notion equally as totalities, the syllogism has attained to thecorrespondence of its Notion or the middle term, and its existence of the difference of its extremes; that is, ithas attained to its truth and in doing so has passed out of subjectivity into objectivity. A The Syllogism of Existence § 1442 Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion−−Section One: Subjectivity107"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"1. The syllogism in its immediate form has for its moments the determinations of the Notion as immediate.Hence they are the abstract determinatenesses of form, which are not yet developed by mediation intoconcretion, but are only single determinatenesses. The first syllogism is, therefore, strictly the formalsyllogism. The formalism of the syllogising process consists in stopping short at the determination of thisfirst syllogism. The Notion, differentiated into its abstract moments, has individuality and universality for itsextremes, and appears itself as the particularity standing between them. On account of their immediacy theyare merely self−related determinatenesses, and one and all a single content. Particularity constitutes themiddle term in the first instance since it unites immediately within itself the two moments of individualityand universality. On account of its determinateness it is on the one hand subsumed under the universal, whileon the other hand the individual, as against which it possesses universality, is subsumed under it. But thisconcretion is in the first instance merely a duality of aspect; on account of the immediacy in which the middleterm presents itself in the immediate syllogism. it appears as a simple determinateness, and the mediationwhich it constitutes is not yet posited. Now the dialectical movement of the syllogism of existence consists inthe positing in its moments of the mediation that alone constitutes the syllogism. (a) First Figure of the Syllogism I−P−U(b) The Second Figure P−I−U(c) The Third Figure I−U−P(d) The Fourth Figure U−U−UB The Syllogism of Reflection§ 1482 The course of the qualitative syllogism has sublated what was abstract in its terms with the result that theterm has posited itself as a determinateness in which the other determinateness is also reflected. Besides theabstract terms, the syllogism also contains their relation, and in the conclusion this relation is posited asmediated and necessary; therefore each determinateness is in truth posited not as an individual, separate one,but as a relation to the other, as a concrete determinateness. § 1483 The middle term was abstract particularity, by itself a simple determinateness, and was a middle term onlyexternally and relatively to the self−subsistent extremes. Now it is posited as the totality of the terms; as suchit is the posited unity of the extremes, but in the first instance it is the unity of reflection which embracesthem within itself −− an inclusion which, as the first sublating of immediacy and the first relating of theterms, is not yet the absolute identity of the Notion. § 1484 The extremes are the determinations of the judgment of reflection, individuality proper and universality as aconnective determination or a reflection embracing a manifold within itself. But the individual subject alsocontains, as we have seen in the case of the judgment of reflection, besides the bare individuality whichbelongs to form, determinateness as universality absolutely reflected into itself, as presupposed, that is herestill immediately assumed, genus. § 1485 From this determinateness of the extremes which belongs to the progressive determination of the judgment,there results the precise content of the middle term, which is essentially the point of interest in the syllogismsince it distinguishes syllogism from judgment. It contains (1) individuality, but (2) individuality extended touniversality as all, (3) universality which forms the basis and absolutely unites within itself individuality andabstract universality −− that is, the genus. It is in this way that the syllogism of reflection is the first to Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion−−Section One: Subjectivity108"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"possess genuine determinateness of form, in that the middle term is posited as the totality of the terms; theimmediate syllogism is by contrast indeterminate, because the middle term is still only abstract particularityin which the moments of its Notion are not yet posited. This first syllogism of reflection may be called thesyllogism of allness. (a) The Syllogism of Allness(b) The Syllogism of Induction(c) The Syllogism of AnalogyC The Syllogism of Necessity § 1502 The mediating element has now determined itself (1) as simple determinate universality, like the particularityin the syllogism of existence, but (2) as objective universality, that is to say, universality which contains theentire determinateness of the distinguished extremes like the allness of the syllogism of reflection, a fulfilledyet simple universality−the universal nature of the fact, the genus. § 1503 This syllogism is pregnant with content, because the abstract middle term of the syllogism of existenceposited itself as determinate difference to become the middle term of the syllogism of reflection, while thisdifference has reflected itself into simple identity again. This syllogism is therefore the syllogism ofnecessity, for its middle term is not some alien immediate content, but the reflection−into−self of thedeterminateness of the extremes. § 1504 These possess in the middle term their inner identity, the determinations of whose content are the formdeterminations of the extremes. Consequently, that which differentiates the terms appears as an external andunessential form, and the terms themselves as moments of a necessary existence. § 1505 In the first instance this syllogism is immediate, and thus formal in so far as the connection of the terms is theessential nature as content, and this content is present in the distinguished terms in only a diverse form, andthe extremes by themselves are merely an unessential subsistence. The realisation of this syllogism has so todetermine it that the extremes also shall be posited as this totality which initially the middle term is, and thatthe necessity of the relation which is at first only the substantial content, shall be a relation of the positedform. (a) The Categorical Syllogism(b) The Hypothetical Syllogism(c) The Disjunctive Syllogism§ 1526 In this way then the formalism of the syllogistic process, and with it the subjectivity of the syllogism and ofthe Notion in general, has sublated itself. This formal or subjective side consisted in the fact that themediating factor of the extremes is the Notion as an abstract determination, and this latter is distinct from theextremes whose unity it is. In the consummation of the syllogism, on the other hand, where objectiveuniversality is no less posited as totality of the form determinations, the distinction of mediating and Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion−−Section One: Subjectivity109"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"mediated has disappeared. That which is mediated is itself an essential moment of what mediates it, and eachmoment appears as the totality of what is mediated. § 1527 The figures of the syllogism exhibit each determinateness of the Notion individually as the middle term,which at the same time is the Notion as an ought−to−be, a demand that the mediating factor shall be theNotion's totality. But the different genera of the syllogism exhibit the stages of impregnation or concretion ofthe middle term. In the formal syllogism the middle term is only posited as totality by all thedeterminatenesses, though each singly, functioning as the mediating factor. In the syllogisms of reflection themiddle term appears as the unity that gathers together externally the determinations of the extremes. In thesyllogism of necessity it has likewise determined itself to the unity that is no less developed and total thansimple, and the form of the syllogism which consisted in the difference of the middle term from its extremeshas thereby sublated itself. § 1528 Thus the Notion as such has been realised; more exactly, it has obtained a reality that is objectivity. The firstreality was that the Notion, as within itself negative unity, sunders itself, and as judgment posits itsdeterminations in a determinate and indifferent difference, and in the syllogism sets itself in opposition tothem. In this way it is still the inwardness of this its externality, but the outcome of the course of thesyllogisms is that this externality is equated with the inner unity; the various determinations return into thisunity through the mediation in which at first they are united only in a third term, and thus the externalityexhibits in its own self the Notion, which therefore is no longer distinguished from it as an inner unity. § 1529 However, this determination of the Notion which has been considered as reality, is, conversely, equally apositedness. For it is not only in this result that the truth of the Notion has exhibited itself as the identity of itsinwardness and externality; already in the judgment the moments of the Notion remain, even in their mutualindifference, determinations that have their significance only in their relation. The syllogism is mediation, thecomplete Notion in its positedness. Its movement is the sublating of this mediation, in which nothing is in andfor itself, but each term is only by means of an other. The result is therefore an immediacy which has issuedfrom the sublating of the mediation, a being which is no less identical with the mediation, and which is theNotion that has restored itself out of, and in, its otherness. This being is therefore a fact that is in and for itselfobjectivity. The Doctrine of the Notion Section Two: ObjectivityMechanism − Chemism − Teleology § 1530 In Book One of the Objective Logic, abstract being was exhibited as passing over into determinate being, butequally as withdrawing into essence. In Book Two, essence reveals itself as determining itself into ground,thereby entering into Existence and realising itself as substance, but again withdrawing into the Notion. Ofthe Notion, now, we have shown to begin with that it determines itself into objectivity. It is self−evident thatthis latter transition is identical in character with what formerly appeared in metaphysics as the inferencefrom the notion, namely, the notion of God, to his existence, or as the so−called ontological proof of theexistence of God. It is equally well known that Descartes' sublimest thought, that God is that whose notion Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion Section Two: Objectivity110"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"includes within itself its being, after being degraded into the defective form of the formal syllogism, that is,into the form of the said proof, finally succumbed to the Critique of Reason and to the thought that existencecannot be extracted from the notion. Some points connected with this proof have already been elucidated. InVol. 1, pp. 86 sqq., where being has vanished in its immediate opposite, non−being, and becoming has shownitself as the truth of both, attention was drawn to the confusion that arises when, in the case of a particulardeterminate being, what is fixed on is not the being of that determinate being but its determinate content;then, comparing this determinate content, for example a hundred dollars, with another determinate content,for example, with the context of my perception or the state of my finances, it is found that it makes adifference whether the former content is added to the latter or not−and it is imagined that what has beendiscussed is the difference between being and non−being, or even the difference between being and theNotion. Further, in the same Vol., p. 112 and Vol. II, p. 442 we elucidated a determination that occurs in theontological proof, that of a sum−total of all realities. But the essential subject matter of that proof, theconnection of the Notion and determinate being, is the concern of our consideration of the Notion justconcluded, and the entire course through which the Notion determines itself into objectivity. The Notion, asabsolutely self−identical negativity, is self−determining; we have remarked that the Notion, in determiningitself into judgment in individuality, is already positing itself as something real, something that is; this stillabstract reality completes itself in objectivity. § 1531 Now though it might seem that the transition from the Notion into objectivity is not the same thing as thetransition from the Notion of God to his existence, it should be borne in mind on the one hand that thedeterminate content, God, makes no difference in the logical process, and the ontological proof is merely anapplication of this logical process to the said content. On the other hand however it is essential to bear inmind the remark made above that the subject only obtains determinateness and content in its predicate; untilthen, no matter what it may be for feeling, intuition and pictorial thinking, for rational cognition it is only aname; but in the predicate with its determinateness there begins, at the same time, realisation in general. Thepredicates, however, must be grasped as themselves still included within the Notion, hence as somethingsubjective, which so far has not emerged into existence; to this extent we must admit on the one hand that therealisation of the Notion in the judgment is still not complete. On the other hand however the meredetermination of an object by predicates, when that determination is not at the same time the realisation andobjectifying of the Notion, also remains something so subjective that it is not even the genuine cognition anddetermination of the Notion of the object−subjective in the sense of abstract reflection and uncomprehendedpictorial thinking. God, as the living God, and still more as absolute spirit, is known only in his activity; manwas early instructed to recognise God in his works; only from these can proceed the determinations, whichare called his properties, and in which, too, his being is contained. Thus the philosophical [begreifende]cognition of his activity, that is, of himself, grasps the Notion of God in his being and his being in his Notion.Being merely as such, or even determinate being, is such a meagre and restricted determination, that thedifficulty of finding it in the Notion may well be the result of not having considered what being ordeterminate being itself is. Being as the wholly abstract, immediate relation to self, is nothing else than theabstract moment of the Notion, which moment is abstract universality. This universality also effects what onedemands of being, namely, to be outside the Notion; for though this universality is moment of the Notion, itis equally the difference, or abstract judgment, of the Notion in which it opposes itself to itself. The Notion, even as formal, already immediately contains being in a truer and richer form, in that, asself−related negativity, it is individuality. § 1532 But of course the difficulty of finding being in the Notion as such and equally in the Notion of God, becomesinsuperable when the being is supposed to be that which obtains in the context of outer experience or in the Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion Section Two: Objectivity111"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"form of sensuous perception, like the hundred dollars in my finances, something to be grasped with the hand,not with the mind, something visible essentially to the outer, not to the inner eye; in other words, when thatbeing which things possess as sensuous, temporal and perishable, is given the name of reality or truth. Aphilosophising that in its view of being does not rise above sense, naturally stops short at merely abstractthought, too, in its view of the Notion; such thought stands opposed to being. § 1533 The custom of regarding the Notion merely as something one−sided, such as abstract thought is, will alreadyhinder the acceptance of what was suggested above, namely, to regard the transition from the Notion of Godto his being, as an application of the logical course of objectification of the Notion presented above. Yet if itis granted, as it commonly is, that the logical element as the formal element constitutes the form for thecognition of every determinate content, then the above relation must at least be conceded, unless in thisopposition between Notion and objectivity, one stops short at the untrue Notion and an equally untrue reality,as something ultimate. But in the exposition of the pure Notion, it was further made clear that this is theabsolute, divine Notion itself, so that in truth the relationship of our application would not obtain, and thelogical process in question would in fact be the immediate exposition of God's self−determination to being.But on this point it is to be remarked that if the Notion is to be presented as the Notion of God, it is to beapprehended as it is when taken up into the Idea. This pure Notion passes through the finite forms of thejudgment and syllogism because it is not yet posited as in its own nature explicitly one with objectivity but isgrasped only in process of becoming it. Similarly this objectivity, too, is not yet the divine existence, is notyet the reality that is reflected in the divine Idea. Yet objectivity is just that much richer and higher than thebeing or existence of the ontological proof, as the pure Notion is richer and higher than that metaphysicalvoid of the sum total of all reality. But I reserve for another occasion the more detailed elucidation of themanifold misunderstanding that has been brought by logical formalism into the ontological, as well as theother, so−called proofs of God's existence, as also the Kantian criticism of them, and by establishing theirtrue significance, to restore the fundamental thoughts of these proofs to their worth and dignity. § 1534 As previously remarked, we have already met with several forms of immediacy, though in differentdeterminations. In the sphere of being immediacy is being itself and determinate being; in the sphere ofessence it is existence, and then actuality and substantiality; in the sphere of the Notion, besides immediacyas abstract universality, there is now objectivity. When the exactitude of philosophical distinctions of theNotion is not involved, these expressions may be used as synonymous; but the determinations mentionedhave issued from the necessity of the Notion. Being is in general the first immediacy, and determinate beingis the same plus the first determinateness. Existence, along with things, is the immediacy that issues from theground−from the self−sublating mediation of the simple reflection of essence. But actuality and substantialityis the immediacy that has issued from the sublated difference of the still unessential Existence as Appearanceand its essentiality. Finally, objectivity is the immediacy to which the Notion determines itself by thesublation of its abstraction and mediation. Philosophy has the right to select from the language of commonlife which is made for the world of pictorial thinking, such expressions as seem to approximate to thedeterminations of the Notion. There cannot be any question of demonstrating for a word selected from thelanguage of common life that in common life, too, one associates with it the same Notion for whichphilosophy employs it; for common life has no Notions, but only pictorial thoughts and general ideas, and torecognise the Notion in what is else a mere general idea is philosophy itself. It must suffice therefore ifpictorial thinking, in the use of its expressions that are employed for philosophical determinations, has beforeit some vague idea of their distinctive meaning; just as it may be the case that in these expressions onerecognises nuances of pictorial thought that are more closely related to the corresponding Notions. One willbe less ready, perhaps, to admit that something can be without existing; but at least, one will hardly use'being' as copula of the judgment as interchangeable with the expression 'to exist' and say, 'this article exists Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion Section Two: Objectivity112"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"dear, suitable, etc.', 'gold exists, a metal or metallic', instead of 'this article is dear, suitable, etc.', 'gold is ametal or metallic'. § 1535 And surely it is usual to distinguish between being and appearing, appearance and actuality, as well as todistinguish mere being from actuality, and still more all these expressions from objectivity. However, evenshould they be employed synonymously, philosophy will in any case be free to utilise such empty superfluityof language for its distinctions. § 1536 When treating of the apodeictic judgment −− the consummation of the judgment −− where the subject losesits determinateness as against the predicate, we referred to the twofold meaning of subjectivity originatingtherefrom, namely, the subjectivity of the Notion, and equally of the externality and contingency opposed tothe Notion. A similar twofold meaning also appears for objectivity which stands opposed to theself−subsistent Notion, yet is also the being that is in−and−for−itself. In the former sense, the object standsopposed to the I = I which in subjective idealism is enunciated as the absolutely true; in that case it is themanifold world in its immediate existence with which the ego or the Notion only engages in never−endingstruggle, in order, by the negation of the intrinsic nullity of this other, to give to the first certainty of self theactual truth of its equality with itself. In a less specific sense it denotes an object in general for any interest oractivity of the subject. § 1537 But in the opposite sense, objectivity signifies that which is in and for itself, and free from limitation andopposition. Rational principles, perfect works of art, etc., are called objective in so far as they are free andabove all contingency. Although rational, theoretical or ethical principles belong only to subjectivity, toconsciousness, yet that element in the latter that is in and for itself is called objective; the cognition of truth isplaced in cognising the object as object, free from anything added by subjective reflection, and right conductin the obedience to objective laws that are not subjective in origin and admit no caprice and no treatment thatmight overthrow their necessity. § 1538 At the present standpoint of our exposition objectivity signifies, in the first instance, the absolute being of theNotion, that is, the Notion that has sublated the mediation posited in its self−determination and converted itinto immediate relation−to−self. Consequently this immediacy is itself immediately and wholly pervaded bythe Notion, just as the Notion's totality is immediately identical with its being. But since, further, the Notionhas equally to restore the free being−for−self of its subjectivity, there arises a relationship between the Notionas end and objectivity. In this relationship the immediacy of the objectivity becomes the negative elementover against the end, an element to be determined by the activity of the end; this immediacy thus acquires theother significance, that of being in and for itself null in so far as it stands opposed to the Notion. § 1539 First, then, objectivity is an immediacy whose moments, by virtue of the totality of all the moments, exist in aself−subsistent indifference as objects outside one another, and in their relationship possess the subjectiveunity of the Notion only as an inner or an outer unity. This is Mechanism. § 1540 Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion Section Two: Objectivity113"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"But secondly, this unity reveals itself as the immanent law of the objects themselves, and thus theirrelationship becomes their peculiar specific difference founded on their law; it becomes a relation in whichtheir determinate self−subsistence sublates itself. This is Chemism. § 1541 Thirdly, this essential unity of the objects is thereby posited as distinct from their self−subsistence; it is thesubjective Notion, but posited as in and for itself related to objectivity, as end. This is Teleology. § 1542 Since the end is the Notion that is posited as in its own self relating itself to objectivity and as sublating by itsown act its defect of being subjective, the purposiveness which is at first external becomes, through therealisation of the end, internal and the Idea. Chapter 1 Mechanism§ 1543 As objectivity is the totality of the Notion withdrawn into its unity, an immediate is thereby posited that is inand for itself this totality, and is also posited as such, although in it the negative unity of the Notion has not asyet detached itself from the immediacy of this totality; in other words, objectivity is not yet posited asjudgment. In so far as it has the Notion immanent in it, it contains the difference of the Notion, but onaccount of the objective totality, the differentiated moments are complete and self−subsistent objects whichconsequently, even in their relation, stand to one another only as self−subsistent things and remain external toone another in every combination. This is what constitutes the character of mechanism, namely, that whateverrelation obtains between the things combined, this relation is one extraneous to them that does not concerntheir nature at all, and even if it is accompanied by a semblance of unity it remains nothing more thancomposition, mixture, aggregation and the like. Spiritual mechanism also, like material, consists in this, thatthe things related in the spirit remain external to one another and to spirit itself. A mechanical style ofthinking, a mechanical memory, habit, a mechanical way of acting, signify that the peculiar pervasion andpresence of spirit is lacking in what spirit apprehends or does. Although its theoretical or practical mechanismcannot take place without its self−activity, without an impulse and consciousness, yet there is lacking in it thefreedom of individuality, and because this freedom is not manifest in it such action appears as a merelyexternal one. A. The Mechanical Object § 1544 The object is, as we have seen, the syllogism, whose mediation has been sublated [ausgeglichen] and hastherefore become an immediate identity. It is therefore in and for itself a universal −− universality not in thesense of a community of properties, but a universality that pervades the particularity and in it is immediateindividuality. § 1545 1. In the first place therefore the object does not differentiate itself into matter and form −− a matter as theself−subsistent universal side of the object and a form as the particular and individual side; such an abstractdifference of individuality and universality is excluded by the Notion of object; if it is regarded as matter it Science of LogicChapter 1 Mechanism114"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"must be taken as in principle formed matter. Similarly, it may be defined as a thing with properties, as awhole consisting of parts, as a substance with accidents, or in terms of other relationships of reflection; butthese relationships have been altogether superseded already in the Notion; the object therefore has neitherproperties nor accidents, for these are separable from the thing or the substance, whereas in the object theparticularity is absolutely reflected into the totality. In the parts of a whole, there is indeed present thatself−subsistence which belongs to the differences of the object, but these differences are themselves directlyand essentially objects, totalities, that are not, like parts, determined as such in contrast to the whole. § 1546 The object is therefore in the first instance indeterminate, in so far as it has no determinate opposition in it;for it is the mediation that has collapsed into immediate identity. In so far as the Notion is essentiallydeterminate, the object possesses determinateness as a manifoldness which though complete is otherwiseindeterminate, that is, contains no relationships, and which constitutes a totality that at first is similarly nofurther determined; sides or parts that may be distinguished in it belong to an external reflection. This quiteindeterminate difference therefore means only that there are a number of objects, each of which only containsits determinateness reflected into its universality and does not reflect itself outwards. Because thisindeterminate determinateness is essential to the object, the latter is within itself a plurality of this kind, andmust therefore be regarded as a composite or aggregate. It does not however consist of atoms, for these arenot objects because they are not totalities. The Leibnizian monad would be more of an object since it is a totalrepresentation of the world, but confined within its intensive subjectivity it is supposed at least to beessentially one within itself. Nevertheless, the monad determined as an exclusive one is only a principle thatreflection assumes. Yet the monad is an object, partly in that the ground of its manifold representations −− ofthe developed, that is, the posited determinations of its merely implicit totality lies outside it, and partly alsoin that it is indifferent to the monad that it constitutes an object along with others; it is thus in fact notexclusive or determined for itself. § 1547 2. As the object, then, in its determined being is a totality and yet on account of its indeterminateness andimmediacy is not the negative unity of that determined being, it is indifferent to the determinations asindividual, as determined in and for themselves, just as these latter are themselves indifferent to one another.These, therefore, are not comprehensible from it nor from one another; its totality is the form of generalreflectedness of its manifoldness into individuality in general which is in its own self indeterminate. Thedeterminatenesses, therefore, that it contains, do indeed belong to it, but the form that constitutes theirdifference and combines them into a unity is an external, indifferent one; whether it be a mixture, or again anorder, a certain arrangement of parts and sides, all these are combinations that are indifferent to what is sorelated. § 1548 Thus the object, like any determinate being in general, has the determinateness of its totality outside it inother objects, and these in turn have theirs outside them, and so on to infinity. The return−into−self of thisprogression to infinity must indeed likewise be assumed and represented as a totality, a world; but that worldis nothing but the universality that is confined within itself by indeterminate individuality, that is, a universe. § 1549 The object, therefore, being in its determinateness equally indifferent to it, it is the object's own nature thatpoints it outside and beyond itself to other objects for its determination; but to these others, their determinantfunction is similarly a matter of indifference. Consequently, a principle of self−determination is nowhere to Science of LogicChapter 1 Mechanism115"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"be found; determinism −− the standpoint occupied by cognition when it takes the object, just as we havefound it here, to be the truth −− assigns for each determination of the object that of another object; but thisother is likewise indifferent both to its being determined and to its active determining. For this reasondeterminism itself is also indeterminate in the sense that it involves the progression to infinity; it can halt andbe satisfied at any point at will, because the object it has reached in its progress, being a formal totality, isshut up within itself and indifferent to its being determined by another. Consequently, the explanation of thedetermination of an object and the progressive determining of the object made for the purpose of theexplanation, is only an empty word, since in the other object to which it advances there resides noself−determination. § 1550 3. Now as the determinateness of an object lies in an other, no determinate difference is to be found betweenthem; the determinateness is merely doubled, once in one object and again in the other, something utterlyidentical, so that the explanation or comprehension is tautological. This tautology is an external futilesee−saw; since the determinateness obtains from the objects which are indifferent to it no peculiardistinctiveness and is therefore only identical, there is before us only one determinateness; and its beingdoubled expresses just this externality and nullity of a difference. But at the same time the objects areself−subsistent in regard to one another; therefore in the identity above−mentioned they remain absolutelyexternal to one another. Here, then, we have the manifest contradiction between the complete mutualindifference of the objects and the identity of their determinateness, or the contradiction of their completeexternality in the identity of their determinateness. This contradiction is, therefore, the negative unity of anumber of objects which, in that unity, simply repel one another: this is the mechanical process. B. The Mechanical Process § 1551 If objects are regarded merely as self−enclosed totalities, they cannot act on one another. In thisdetermination they are the same thing as the monads, which for this very reason were thought of as exercisingno influence whatever on one another. But the concept of a monad is, just for this reason, a defectivereflection. For first it is a determinate conception of the monad's merely implicit totality; as a certain degreeof the development and positedness of its representation of the world, it is determinate; now while it is aself−enclosed totality, it is also indifferent to this determinateness; therefore the determinateness is not itsown, but one that is posited by another object. Secondly it is an immediate in general, in so far as it issupposed to be merely a mirroring entity; its relation to itself is therefore abstract universality; hence it is adeterminate being open to others. To gain the freedom of substance it is not sufficient to represent it as atotality that is complete within itself and has nothing to receive from without. On the contrary, themechanical [begrifflose], merely mirrored relation to itself is precisely a passivity towards another. Similarlydeterminateness, whether taken as the determinateness of something that is or of a mirroring entity, that is adegree of the monad's own spontaneous development, is something external; the degree that the developmentreaches has its limit in an other. To shift the reciprocity of substances on to a predetermined harmony meansnothing more than to convert it into a presupposition, that is, to withdraw it from the Notion. The need toavoid the interaction of substances was based on the moment of absolute self−subsistence and originalitywhich was made a fundamental assumption. But since the positedness, the degree of development, does notcorrespond to this in−itself, it has for that very reason its ground in an other. § 1552 When treating of the relationship of substantiality, we showed that it passes over into the causal relationship.But here what is, no longer has the determination of a substance, but of an object; the causal relationship has Science of LogicChapter 1 Mechanism116"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"been superseded in the Notion; the originality of one substance in relation to the other has shown itself to beillusory, its action to be transition into the opposed substance. This relationship therefore has no objectivity.Hence in so far as the one object is posited in the form of subjective unity as active cause, this no longercounts as an original determination but as something mediated; the active object has this its determinationonly by means of another object. Mechanism, since it belongs to the sphere of the Notion, has that positedwithin it which proved to be the truth of the causal relationship, namely that the cause, which is supposed tobe the original and self−subsistent factor is essentially effect, positedness, as well. In mechanism thereforethe causality of the object is immediately a non−originality; it is indifferent to this its determination, thereforeits being cause is for it something contingent. To this extent, one might indeed say that the causality ofsubstances is only a subjective conception. But this causality as thus represented is precisely mechanism; formechanism is this, that causality as identical determinateness of different substances and hence as theextinction of their self−subsistence in this identity, is a mere positedness; the objects are indifferent to thisunity and maintain themselves in face of it. But, no less is this their indifferent self−subsistence also a merepositedness; they are therefore capable of mixing and aggregating and of becoming, as an aggregate, oneobject. Through this indifference both to their transition and to their self−subistence, substances are objects. (a) The Formal Mechanical Process(b) The Real Mechanical Process(c) The Product of the Mechanical ProcessC. Absolute Mechanism(a) The Centre§ 1567 In the first place then the empty manifoldness of objects is gathered into objective individuality, into thesimple self−determining centre. Secondly, in so far as the object as an immediate totality retains itsindifference to determinateness, the latter is present in it also as unessential or as a mutual externality ofmany objects. The prior, the essential determinateness, on the other hand, constitutes the real middle termbetween the many mechanically interacting bodies, by which they are united in and for themselves, and istheir objective universality. Universality exhibited itself at first in the relationship of communication aspresent only through positing; but as objective universality it is the pervading immanent essence of theobjects. § 1568 In the material world it is the central body that is the genus, but it is the individual universality of the singleobjects and their mechanical process. The relationship in which the unessential single bodies stand to oneanother is one of mutual thrust and pressure; this kind of relationship does not hold between the central bodyand the objects whose essence it is, for their externality no longer constitutes their basic determination. Theiridentity with the central body is, therefore, rather rest, namely, the being in their centre; this unity is theirabsolute Notion. It remains, however, merely an ought−to−be, since the externality of the objects which isstill also posited does not correspond to that unity. Their consequent striving towards the centre is theirabsolute universality, not a universality posited by communication; it constitutes the true rest that is itselfconcrete and not posited from outside, into which the process of the non−self−subsistent bodies must return.That is why it is an empty abstraction to assume in mechanics that a body set in motion would continue tomove in a straight line to infinity if external resistance did not rob it of its motion. Friction, or whatever otherform resistance takes, is only the manifestation of centrality; for it is centrality that in an absolute mannerbrings the body back to itself; for the thing in contact with which the moving body meets friction has thepower of resistance solely through its union with the centre. In the spiritual sphere the centre and unity withthe centre assume higher forms; but the unity of the Notion and its reality which here, to begin with, ismechanical centrality, must there too constitute the basic determination. Science of LogicChapter 1 Mechanism117"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"§ 1569 Thus the central body has ceased to be a mere object, for in the latter the determinateness is an unessentialelement; for the central body no longer possesses the objective totality only implicitly but also explicitly. Itcan therefore be regarded as an individual. Its determinateness is essentially different from a mere order orarrangement and external connection of parts; as determinateness in and for itself it is an immanent form, aself−determining principle in which the objects inhere and by which they are bound together into a genuineOne. § 1570 But this central individual is thus at first only a middle term which as yet has no true extremes; but asnegative unity of the total Notion it sunders itself into such. Or in other words the previouslynon−self−subsistent, self−external objects are likewise by the regress of the Notion determined intoindividuals; the identity of the central body with itself which is still a striving, is infected with externalitywhich, being taken up into the centra body's objective individuality, has this latter determinationcommunicated to it. Through this centrality of their own, these individuals placed outside that first centre, arethemselves centres for the non−self−subsistent objects. These second centres and the non−self−subsistentobjects are brought into unity by the above absolute middle term. § 1571 But the relative individual centres themselves also constitute the middle term of a second syllogism, a middleterm that on the one hand is subsumed under a higher extreme, namely the objective universality and powerof the absolute centre, and on the other hand subsumes under itself the non−self−subsistent objects whosesuperficial or formal individualisation is supported by it. Again, these non−self−subsistent objects are themiddle term of a third, the formal syllogism, in that they are the link between the absolute and the relativecentral individuality to the extent that the latter has in them its externality by virtue of which therelation−to−self is at the same time a striving towards an absolute centre. The formal objects have for theiressence the identical gravity of their immediate central body in which they inhere as in their subject and theextreme of individuality; through the externality which they constitute, that body is subsumed under theabsolute central body; they are, therefore, the formal middle term of particularity. But the absolute individualis the objectively universal middle term which brings into unity and holds fast the being−within−self orinwardness of the relative individual and its externality. Similarly, too, the government, the individualcitizens and the needs or external life of the individuals, are three terms, each of which is the middle of theother two. The government is the absolute centre in which the extreme of the individuals is united with theirexternal existence; similarly, the individuals are the middle term that activate that universal individual intoexternal concrete existence and translate their moral essence into the extreme of actuality. The third syllogismis the formal syllogism, that of an illusory show, in which the individuals purport to be linked to thisuniversal absolute individuality by their needs and external existence; a syllogism which, as merelysubjective, passes over into the others and in them has its truth. § 1572 This totality, whose moments are themselves the complete relationships of the Notion, the syllogisms inwhich each of the three different objects runs through the determination of middle term and of extremes,constitutes free mechanism. In it the different objects have for their basic determination the objectiveuniversality, the pervasive gravity that maintains its identity in the particularisation. The relations of pressure,thrust, attraction and the like, as also aggregations or mixtures, belong to the relationship of externality whichforms the basis of the third of this group of syllogisms. Order, which is the merely external determinatenessof objects, has passed over into the determination that is immanent and objective; this is Law. Science of LogicChapter 1 Mechanism118"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"(b) Law § 1573 In law, the more specific difference between the ideal reality of objectivity and its external reality is madeprominent. The object, as immediate totality of the Notion, does not yet possess externality as distinct fromthe Notion which is not yet posited for itself. The object, being withdrawn into itself through the process,there has arisen the opposition of simple centrality against an externality which is now determined asexternality, that is, is posited as that which is not in and for itself. That identical or ideal aspect ofindividuality is, on account of the relation to externality, an ought−to−be; it is that unity of the Notion,absolutely determined and self−determining, to which that external reality does not correspond, and thereforegets no further than a striving towards it. But individuality is in and for itself the concrete principle ofnegative unity, and as such itself totality, a unity that sunders itself into the specific differences of the Notionand abides within its self−identical universality; it is thus the centre expanded within its pure ideality bydifference. § 1574 This reality which corresponds to the Notion is the ideal reality that is distinct from the reality that wasmerely a striving; it is the difference, not as in the first instance a plurality of objects, but difference in itsessential nature and taken up into pure universality. This real ideality is the soul of the previously developedobjective totality, the absolutely determined identity of the system. § 1575 The objective being−in−and−for−self appears therefore more specifically in its totality as the negative unityof the centre, which divides itself into subjective individuality and external objectivity, maintains the formerin the latter and determines it in an ideal difference. This self−determining unity that absolutely reducesexternal objectivity to ideality is the principle of self−movement the determinateness of this animatingprinciple, which is the difference of the Notion itself, is law. Dead mechanism was the mechanical processconsidered above of objects that appeared immediately as self−subsistent but which for that very reason are,in truth, not self−subsistent and have their centre outside themselves; this process, which passes over intorest, exhibits either contingency and indeterminate dissimilarity or formal uniformity. This uniformity isindeed a rule, but not a law. Only free mechanism has a law, the spontaneous determination of pureindividuality or of the explicated Notion; as difference, it is in its own self the imperishable source ofself−kindling movement, and since in the ideality of its difference it relates itself to itself alone, it is freenecessity. (c) Transition of Mechanism § 1576 This soul, however, is still submerged in its body: the Notion of the objective totality, determinate now butinner, is free necessity −− the law has not yet confronted its object; it is the concrete centrality as universalityimmediately expanded into its objectivity. This ideality, therefore, has not the objects themselves for itsdeterminate difference; these are self−subsistent individuals of the totality, or also, if we look back to theformal stage, non−individual, external objects. Law is indeed immanent in them and constitutes their natureand power; but its difference is confined within its ideality, and the objects are not themselves differentiatedinto the ideal difference of the law. But it is solely in the ideal centrality and its laws that the object possessesits essential self−subsistence; it is therefore powerless to resist the judgment of the Notion and to maintainitself in abstract, indeterminate self−subsistence and aloofness. Science of LogicChapter 1 Mechanism119"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"§ 1577 By virtue of the ideal difference immanent in it, its existence is a determinateness posited by the Notion. Itslack of self−subsistence is in this way no longer merely a striving towards the centre, as against which, justbecause its relation to it is only a striving, it still has the appearance of a self−subsistent external object; onthe contrary, it is a striving towards the object specifically opposed to it; and similarly the centre itself has inconsequence fallen asunder and its negative unity passed has over into objectified opposition. Centrality is,therefore, now a relation of these reciprocally negative objectivities in a state of mutual tension. Thus freemechanism determines itself into chemism. Chapter 2 Chemism§ 1578 Chemism constitutes in objectivity as a whole, the moment of judgment, of the difference that has becomeobjective, and of the process. Since it already begins with determinateness and positedness and the chemicalobject is at the same time an objective totality, its immediate course is simple and is completely determinedby its presupposition. A. THE CHEMICAL OBJECT § 1579 The chemical object is distinguished from the mechanical by the fact that the latter is a totality indifferent todeterminateness, whereas in the case of the chemical object the determinateness, and consequently therelation to other and the kind and manner of this relation, belong to its nature. This determinateness is at thesame time essentially a particularisation, that is, it is taken up into universality; thus it is a principle −−universal determinateness, the determinateness not only of the one individual object but also of the other. Inthe chemical object, therefore, we now have the distinction between its Notion as the inner totality of the twodeterminatenesses, and the determinateness that constitutes the nature of the individual object in itsexternality and concrete existence. Since in this way it is in itself or implicitly the whole Notion, it has in itsown self the necessity and the urge to sublate its opposed, one sided −− existence and to give itself anexistence as that real whole that according to its Notion it is. § 1580 With regard to the expression chemism for the relation of the difference of objectivity as it has presenteditself, it may be further remarked that the expression must not be understood here as though this relation onlyexhibited itself in that form of elemental nature to which the name chemism so called is strictly applied. Eventhe meteorological relation must be regarded as a process whose parts have the nature more of physical thanchemical elements. In the animate world, the sex relation comes under this schema and it also constitutes theformal basis for the spiritual relations of love, friendship, and the like. § 1581 Examined more closely the chemical object, as a self−subsistent totality in general, is in the first instance anobject that is reflected into itself and to that extent is distinct from its reflectedness outwards −− an indifferentbase, the individual not yet specified as different; the person, too, is such a base related at first only to itself.But the immanent determinateness which constitutes its difference, is first reflected into itself in such amanner that this retraction of the relation outwards is only formal abstract universality; thus the relation Science of LogicChapter 2 Chemism120"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"outwards is the determination of its immediacy and concrete existence. From this aspect, it does not in itsown self return into the individual totality; and the negative unity has the two moments of its opposition intwo particular objects. Accordingly, a chemical object is not comprehensible from itself alone, and the beingof one is the being of the other. But secondly, the determinateness is absolutely reflected into itself and is theconcrete moment of the individual Notion of the whole, which Notion is the universal essence, the real genusof the particular object. The chemical object, which is thus the contradiction of its immediate positedness andits immanent individual Notion, is a striving to sublate the determinateness of its existence and to giveconcrete existence to the objective totality of the Notion. Therefore, though it also lacks self−subsistence, itspontaneously tenses itself against this deficiency and initiates the process by its self−determining. B. THE CHEMICAL PROCESS § 1582 1. It begins with the presupposition that the objects in tension, tensed as they are against themselves, are inthe first instance by that very fact just as much tensed against one another −− a relationship that is called theiraffinity. Since each through its Notion stands in contradiction to the one−sidedness of its own existence andconsequently strives to sublate it, there is immediately posited in this fact the striving to sublate theone−sidedness of the other object; and through this reciprocal adjustment and combination to posit a realityconformable to the Notion, which contains both moments. § 1583 As each of the objects is posited as self−contradictory and self−sublating in its own self, it is only by anexternal compulsion [Gewalt] that they are held apart from one another and from their reciprocal integration.Now the middle term whereby these extremes are concluded into a unity is first the implicit nature of both,the whole Notion that holds both within itself. Secondly, however, since in their concrete existence they standconfronting each other, their absolute unity is also a still formal element having an existence distinct fromthem −− the element of communication in which they enter into external community with each other. Sincethe real difference belongs to the extremes, this middle term is only the abstract neutrality, the real possibilityof those extremes; it is, as it were, the theoretical element of the concrete existence of chemical objects, oftheir process and its result. In the material world water fulfils the function of this medium; in the spiritualworld, so far as the analogue of such a relation has a place there, the sign in general, and more preciselylanguage, is to be regarded as fulfilling that function. § 1584 The relationship of the objects, as a mere communication in this element, is on the one hand a quiescentcoming−together, but on the other hand it is no less a negative bearing of each to the other; for incommunication the concrete Notion which is their nature is posited as a reality, with the result that the realdifferences of the objects are reduced to its unity. Their previous self−subsistent determinateness is thussublated in the union that conforms to the Notion, which is one and the same in both, and thereby theiropposition and tension are weakened, with the result that in this reciprocal integration the striving reaches itsquiescent neutrality. § 1585 The process is in this way extinguished; the contradiction between the Notion and reality being resolved, theextremes of the syllogism have lost their opposition and have thus ceased to be extremes both against eachother and against the middle term. The product is neutral, that is, a product in which the ingredients, whichcan no longer be called objects, have lost their tension and with it those properties which belonged to them as Science of LogicChapter 2 Chemism121"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"tensed, while the capability of their former self−subsistence and tension is preserved. For the negative unityof the neutral product proceeds from a presupposed difference; the determinateness of the chemical object isidentical with its objectivity, it is original. Through the process just considered this difference is as yet onlyimmediately sublated; the determinateness is, therefore, as yet not absolutely reflected into itself, andconsequently the product of the process is only a formal unity. § 1586 2. Now in this product, the tension of the opposition and the negative unity, as activity of the process, areindeed extinct. But since this unity is essential to the Notion and has at the same time come into concreteexistence, it is still present, though its place is outside the neutral object. The process does not spontaneouslyre−kindle itself, for it had the difference only for its presupposition and did not itself posit it. Thisself−subsistent negativity outside the object, the existence of the abstract individuality whose being−for−selfhas its reality in the indifferent object, is now tensed within itself against its abstraction, and is an inwardrestless activity that turns outwards to consume. It relates itself immediately to the object whose quiescentneutrality is the real possibility of its opposition; that object is now the middle term of the previously merelyformal neutrality, now inwardly concrete and determinate. § 1587 The more precise immediate relation of the extreme of negative unity to the object is that the latter isdetermined by it and thereby disrupted. This disruption may in the first instance be regarded as the restorationof that opposition of the objects in tension with which chemism began. But this determination does notconstitute the other extreme of the syllogism but belongs to the immediate relation of the differentiatingprinciple to the middle term in which this principle gives itself its immediate reality; it is the determinatenessthat the middle term in the disjunctive syllogism also possesses besides being the universal nature of theobject, and by virtue of which the object is both objective universality and also determinate particularity. Theother extreme of the syllogism stands opposed to the external self−subsistent extreme of individuality; it istherefore the equally self−subsistent extreme of universality; hence the disruption suffered by the realneutrality of the middle term in this extreme is that it is split up into moments whose relationship is not thatof difference, but of indifference. Accordingly these moments are the abstract indifferent base on the oneside, and its energising principle on the other, which latter by its separation from the base attains likewise theform of indifferent objectivity. § 1588 This disjunctive syllogism is the totality of chemism in which the same objective whole is exhibited first asself−subsistent negative unity, then in the middle term as real unity, and finally as the chemical realityresolved into its abstract moments. In these latter the determinateness has not reached its reflection−into−selfin an other as in the neutral product, but has in itself returned into its abstraction, and is an originallydeterminate element. § 1589 3. These elementary objects are accordingly liberated from chemical tension; in them, the original basis ofthat presupposition with which chemism began has been posited through the real process. Now further, theinner determinateness as such of these ,objects is essentially the contradiction of their simple indifferentsubsistence and themselves as determinateness, and is the urge outwards that sunders itself and posits tensionin its object and in another object in order to have something with which it can enter into a relation ofdifference and in which it can neutralise itself and give to its simple determinateness an existent reality.Consequently, on the one hand chemism has returned into its beginning in which objects in a state of Science of LogicChapter 2 Chemism122"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"reciprocal tension seek one another and then by a formal, external middle term, unite to form a neutralproduct. On the other hand, chemism by this return into its Notion sublates itself and has passed over into ahigher sphere. C. TRANSITION OF CHEMISM § 1590 Even ordinary chemistry shows examples of chemical alterations in which a body, for example, imparts ahigher oxidation to one part of its mass and thereby reduces another part to a lower degree of oxidation, inwhich lower degree alone it can enter into a neutral combination with another [chemically] different bodybrought into contact with it, a combination for which it would not have been receptive in that first immediatedegree. What happens here is that the object does not relate itself to another in accordance with an immediate,one−sided determinateness, but that in accordance with the inner totality of an original relation it posits thepresupposition which it requires for a real relation and thereby gives itself a middle term through which itunites its Notion with its reality; it is absolutely determined individuality, the concrete Notion as principle ofthe disjunction into extremes whose re−union is the activity of the same negative principle, which therebyreturns to its first determination, but returns objectified. § 1591 Chemism itself is the first negation of indifferent objectivity and of the externality of determinateness; it istherefore still infected with the immediate self−subsistence of the object and with externality. Consequently itis not yet for itself that totality of self−determination that proceeds from it and in which rather it is sublated.The three syllogisms yielded by the foregoing exposition constitute its totality; the first has for middle termformal neutrality and for extremes the objects in tension; the second has for middle term the product of thefirst, real neutrality, and for extremes the sundering activity and its product, the indifferent element; while thethird is the self−realising Notion, which posits for itself the presupposition by which the process of itsrealisation is conditioned −− a syllogism that has the universal for its essence. On account, however, of theimmediacy and externality attaching to chemical objectivity, these syllogisms still fall apart. The first processwhose product is the neutrality of the objects in tension is extinguished in its product, and it is an externallyapplied differentiation that re−kindles it; conditioned by an immediate presupposition, it exhausts itself in it.Similarly, the separation of the [chemically] different extremes out of the neutral product, as also theirdecomposition into their abstract elements, must proceed from conditions and stimulations of activityexternally brought into play. Also, although the two essential moments of the process, on the one sideneutralisation, on the other separation and reduction, are combined in one and the same process, and theunion of the extremes by weakening of the tension between them is also a sundering into such extremes, yeton account of the still underlying externality they constitute two different sides; the extremes that areseparated in that same process are different objects or materials from those that unite in it; in so far as theformer emerge again from the process as [chemically] different they must turn outwards; their newneutralisation is a different process from the neutralisation that took place in the first process. § 1592 But these various processes, which have proved themselves necessary, are so many stages by whichexternality and conditionedness are sublated and from which the Notion emerges as a totality determined inand for itself and not conditioned by externality. In the first process, the mutual externality of the differentextremes that constitute the whole reality, or the distinction between the implicitly determinate Notion and itsexistent determinateness, is sublated; in the second, the externality of the real unity, the union as merelyneutral, is sublated; more precisely, the formal activity in the first instance sublates itself in equally formalbases or indifferent determinatenesses, whose inner Notion is now the indrawn absolute activity as inwardly Science of LogicChapter 2 Chemism123"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"self−realising, that is, the activity that posits the determinate differences within itself and through thismediation constitutes itself as real unity −− a mediation which is thus the Notion's own mediation, itsself−determination, and in respect of its reflection thence into itself, an immanent presupposing. The thirdsyllogism, which on the one hand is the restoration of the preceding processes, on the other hand sublates thelast remaining moment of indifferent bases the wholly abstract external immediacy, which in this waybecomes the Notion's own moment of self−mediation. The Notion which has thus sublated all the moments ofits objective existence as external, and posited them within its simple unity, is thereby completely liberatedfrom objective externality, to which it relates itself only as to an unessential reality. This objective freeNotion is end. Chapter 3 Teleology − next sectionSubjective End − The Means − The Realised End § 1593 Where purposiveness is discerned, an intelligence [Verstand] is assumed as its author, and for the end wetherefore demand the Notion's own free Existence. Teleology is especially contrasted with mechanism, inwhich the determinateness posited in the object, being external, is essentially one in which noself−determination is manifested. The opposition between causae efficientes and causae finalis, betweenmerely efficient and final causes, relates to this distinction; and this distinction, taken in a concrete form, isalso made the criterion for deciding whether the absolute essence of the world is to be conceived as blindnatural mechanism or as an intelligence that determines itself in accordance with ends. The antinomybetween fatalism, along with determinism and freedom, is likewise concerned with the opposition ofmechanism and teleology; for the free is the Notion in its Existence. § 1594 Earlier metaphysics has treated these concepts as it has treated others; it has for one thing presupposed acertain conception of the world and laboured to show that one or the other concept fitted it, while the oppositeone was defective because it failed to explain that conception; and again, while doing this, it has notexamined the concept of mechanical cause and of end, to see which possesses truth in and for itself. Whenthis has been established independently, the objective world may present us with mechanical and final causes;but their existence is not the standard of truth: on the contrary, truth is the criterion that decides which ofthese existences is the true one. Just as the subjective understanding also exhibits errors in itself, so theobjective world also exhibits aspects and stages of truth that by themselves are still one−sided, incompleteand only relationships in the sphere of Appearance. If mechanism and purposiveness stand opposed to oneanother, they cannot for that very reason be taken as indifferent concepts, each of which is correct on its ownaccount, possessing as much validity as the other, the only question being where one or the other may beapplied. This equal validity of both rests merely on the fact that they are, that is to say, that we have themboth. But since they are opposed, the necessary preliminary question is, which of the two is the true one; andthe higher and real question is, whether their truth is not a third concept, or whether one of them is the truthof the other. But the relation of end has proved to be the truth of mechanism −− what exhibited itself aschemism is included with mechanism in so far as end is the Notion in free Existence; and to end standsopposed in general the unfreedom of the Notion, its submergence in externality; both of them, therefore,mechanism and chemism, are included under natural necessity; for in the former the Notion does not exist inthe object. Since the object as mechanical does not contain self−determination, while in chemism the Notioneither has a one−sided Existence in a state of tension, or, in emerging as the unity that disjoins the neutralobject into tensed extremes, is external to itself in so far as it sublates this disjunction. Science of LogicChapter 3 Teleology − next section124"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"§ 1595 The more the teleological principle was linked with the concept of an extramundane intelligence and to thatextent was favoured by piety, the more it seemed to depart from the true investigation of nature, which aimsat cognising the properties of nature not as extraneous, but as immanent determinatenesses and accepts onlysuch cognition as a valid comprehension. As end is the Notion itself in its Existence, it may seem strange thatthe cognition of objects from their Notion appears rather as an unjustified trespass into a heterogeneouselement, whereas mechanism, for which the determinateness of an object is a determinateness posited in itexternally and by another object, is held to be a more immanent point of view than teleology. Of coursemechanism, at least the ordinary unfree mechanism, and also chemism must be regarded as an immanentprinciple in so far as the external determinant is itself again just such another object, externally determinedand indifferent to such determining, or, in the case of chemism, the other object is one likewise chemicallydetermined; in general, an essential moment of the totality always lies in something outside it. Theseprinciples therefore remain confined within the same natural form of finitude; yet though they do not seek togo beyond the finite and lead only to finite causes in their explanation of phenomena, which themselvesdemand a further progress, at the same time they expand themselves, partly into a formal totality in theconcept of force, cause, and similar determinations of reflection which are supposed to denote a primariness,and partly also through the abstract universality of a sum total of forces, a whole of reciprocal causes.Mechanism shows itself to be a striving for totality in the fact that it seeks to grasp nature by itself as a wholethat for its Notion does not require any other −− a totality that is not found in end and the extra−mundaneintelligence associated with it. Now purposiveness shows itself in the first instance as a higher being in general, as an intelligence thatexternally determines the multiplicity of objects by a unity that exists in and for itself, so that the indifferentdeterminatenesses of the objects become essential through this relation. In mechanism they become sothrough the mere form of necessity, their content being indifferent; for they are supposed to remain external,and it is only understanding as such that is supposed to find satisfaction in cognising its own connectiveprinciple, abstract identity. In teleology, on the contrary, the content becomes important, for teleologypresupposes a Notion, something absolutely determined and therefore self−determining, and so has made adistinction between the relation of the differences and their reciprocal determinedness, that is the form, andthe unity that is reflected into itself, a unity that is determined in and for itself and therefore a content. Butwhen the content is otherwise a finite and insignificant one, it contradicts what it is supposed to be; for end,according to its form, is a totality infinite within itself−especially when the activity that operates inaccordance with ends is assumed to be an absolute will and intelligence. The reason why teleology hasincurred so much the reproach of triviality is that the ends that it exhibited are more important or more trivial,as the case may be; and it was inevitable that the end relation of objects should so often appear trifling, sinceit appears to be so external and therefore contingent. Mechanism, on the contrary, leaves to thedeterminatenesses of objects, as regards their import, their contingent status, to which the object isindifferent, and these determinatenesses are not supposed to have, either for the objects or for the subjectiveintelligence, any higher validity. This principle, therefore, in its context of external necessity gives theconsciousness of infinite freedom as compared with teleology, which sets up for something absolute what istrivial and even contemptible in its content, in which the more universal thought can only find itself infinitelycramped and even feel disgusted. § 1596 The formal disadvantage from which this teleology immediately suffers is that it only goes as far as externalpurposiveness. The Notion being thus posited as something formal, then for such teleology the content is alsosomething that for the Notion is given externally in the manifoldness of the objective world −− in those verydeterminatenesses which are also the content of mechanism, but appearing there as something external andcontingent. On account of this community of content, it is solely the form of purposiveness by itself that Science of LogicChapter 3 Teleology − next section125"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"constitutes what is essential in this teleology. In this respect, without as yet attending to the difference ofouter and inner purposiveness, the end−relation in general has proved itself to be in and for itself the truth ofmechanism. Teleology possesses in general the higher principle, the Notion in its Existence, which is in andfor itself the infinite and absolute−a principle of freedom that in the utter certainty of its self−determination isabsolutely liberated from the external determining of mechanism. § 1597 One of Kant's great services to philosophy consists in the distinction he has made between relative orexternal, and internal purposiveness; in the latter he has opened up the Notion of life, the Idea, and by sodoing has done positively for philosophy what the Critique of Pure Reason did but imperfectly, equivocally,and only negatively, namely, raised it above the determinations of reflection and the relative world ofmetaphysics. It has been remarked that the opposition of teleology and mechanism is in the first instance themore general opposition of freedom and necessity. Kant has exhibited the opposition in this form among theantinomies of reason, namely, as the third conflict of the transcendental ideas. His exposition, which wasreferred to earlier, I cite quite briefly, as the gist of it is so simple as to require no detailed analysis, and thepeculiar features of the Kantian antinomies have been elucidated in more detail elsewhere. The thesis of the antinomy here to be considered runs thus: Causality according to natural laws is not the solecausality from which the phenomena of the world can one and all be derived. For their explanation a causalitythrough freedom must be assumed as well. The antithesis is: There is no freedom, but everything in the world happens solely according to natural laws. As in the case of the other antinomies, the proof first sets to work apagogically, the opposite of each thesisbeing assumed; secondly and conversely in order to show the contradictory nature of this assumption, itsopposite, which is accordingly the proposition to be proved, is assumed and presupposed as valid. The wholeroundabout method of proof could therefore be spared; the proof consists in nothing but the assertoricalaffirmation of the two opposed propositions. Thus in order to prove the thesis we have first to assume that there is no other causality than that according tonatural laws, that is, according to the necessity of mechanism in general, including chemism. This propositionw e find to be selfcontradictory, because we take natural law to consist just in this, that nothing happenswithout a cause sufficiently determined a priori, which cause therefore must contain an absolute spontaneitywithin itself; that is, the assumption opposed to the thesis is contradictory because it contradicts the thesis. In order to prove the antithesis, we are to postulate that there exists a freedom, as a particular kind ofcausality, that absolutely initiates a state of things and therefore also a series of consequences of that state.But now, since such a beginning presupposes a state that has no causal connection whatever with itspredecessor, it contradicts the law of causality which alone makes unity of experience, and experience at all,possible; in other words the assumption of freedom, which is opposed to the antithesis, cannot be madebecause it contradicts the antithesis. § 1598 What is essentially the same antinomy recurs in the Critique of Teleological judgment as the oppositionbetween the assertion that all production of material things takes place according to merely mechanical lawsand the assertion that some cases of production of material things according to such laws are not possible.The Kantian solution of this antinomy is the same as the general solution of the others; namely that reasoncan prove neither the one proposition nor the other, because we cannot have a priori any determiningprinciple of the possibility of things according to merely empirical natural laws; that further, therefore, both Science of LogicChapter 3 Teleology − next section126"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"must be regarded not as objective propositions but as subjective maxims; that on the one hand I am always toreflect on all natural events according to the principle of natural mechanism alone, but that this does notprevent me, when occasion demands it, from investigating certain natural forms in accordance with anothermaxim, namely, on the principle of final causes; as though now these two maxims, which moreover aresupposed to be necessary only for human reason, did not stand in the same opposition as the propositions inquestion. As was remarked before, this whole standpoint fails to examine the sole question to whichphilosophic interest demands an answer, namely, which of the two principles possesses truth in and for itself;but for this point of view it makes no difference whether the principles are to be regarded as objective, whichmeans here, externally existing determinations of nature, or as mere maxims of a subjective cognition; rather,that is a subjective, that is, a contingent conjunction which, as the occasion demands, applies one or the othermaxim according as it holds it to be appropriate to the given objects, but without further enquiry into the truthof these determinations themselves, whether these are determinations of the objects or of cognition. § 1599 However unsatisfactory, therefore, the discussion of the teleological principle is in respect of its essentialpoint of view, nevertheless the position that Kant gives to it is worthy of note. In ascribing it to a reflectivejudgment, he makes it a connecting middle term between the universal of reason and theindividual ofintuition; further, he distinguishes this reflective judgment from the determining judgment, the latter merelysubsuming the particular under the universal. Such a universal which merely subsumes, is an abstractionwhich only becomes concrete in something else, in the particular. End, on the contrary, is the concreteuniversal, which possesses in its own self the moment of particularity and externality and is therefore activeand the urge to repel itself from itself. The Notion, as end, is of course an objective judgment in which onedetermination, the subject, namely the concrete Notion, is self−determined, while the other is not merely apredicate but external objectivity. But the end relation is not for that reason a reflective judging that considersexternal objects only according to a unity, as though an intelligence had given this unity for the convenienceof our cognitive faculty; on the contrary it is the absolute truth that judges objectively and determines externalobjectivity absolutely. Thus the end relation is more than judgment; it is the syllogism of the self−subsistentfree Notion that unites itself with itself through objectivity. § 1600 End has shown itself to be the third to mechanism and chemism it is their truth. Since it still stands within thesphere of objectivity, or of the immediacy of the total Notion, it is still affected by externality as such and isconfronted by an objective world to which it relates itself. From this side, mechanical causality, which ingeneral is to be taken as including chemism, still makes its appearance in this end relation which is theexternal one, but as subordinate to it and as sublated in and for itself. As regards the more precise relationship, the mechanical object is, as an immediate totality, indifferent to itsbeing determined, and on the other hand is equally indifferent to being a determinant. This externaldeterminedness has now developed into self−determination and accordingly the Notion, which in the objectwas merely the inner, or what is the same thing, merely the outer Notion, is now posited; end is, in the firstinstance, just this very Notion that is external to the Notion of mechanism. Thus for chemism too, end is theself−determining principle which brings back into the unity of the Notion the external determinedness bywhich it is conditioned. From this can be seen the nature of the subordination of the two previous forms of the objective process; theother, which in them lies in the infinite progress, is the Notion posited at first as external to them, which isend; not only is the Notion their substance, but externality, too, is for them an essential moment constitutingtheir determinateness. Thus mechanical or chemical technique, through its character of being externallydetermined, offers itself spontaneously to the end relation, which we have now to consider more closely. Science of LogicChapter 3 Teleology − next section127"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"A. THE SUBJECTIVE END § 1601 In the centrality of the objective sphere, which is an indifference to determinateness, the subjective Notionhas first rediscovered and posited the negative point of unity; but in chemism it has posited the objectivity ofthe Notion determinations by which it is first posited as concrete objective Notion. Its determinateness orsimple difference now possesses within itself the determinateness of externality, and its simple unity isconsequently the unity that repels itself from itself and in so doing maintains itself. End therefore is thesubjective Notion as an essential effort and urge to posit itself externally. In this process it is exempt fromtransition. It is neither a force expressing itself nor a substance and cause manifesting itself in accidents andeffects. Force that has not expressed itself is only an abstract inner; that is, it is only in its expression, towhich it must be solicited, that it has a determinate being. § 1602 Similarly with cause and substance; since they have actuality only in the accidents and the effect, theiractivity is transition, against which they do not maintain themselves in freedom. End may indeed also bedefined as force and cause, but these expressions fulfil only an incomplete side of its significance; if they areto be predicated of it as it truly is, they can be predicated only in a way that sublates their Notion: as a forcethat solicits itself to expression, as a cause that is cause of itself, or whose effect is immediately cause. § 1603 When purposiveness is ascribed to an intelligence, as was mentioned above, then in doing so regard is had tothe specific element of the content. But in general end is to be taken as the rational in its concrete existence. Itmanifests rationality because it is the concrete Notion, which holds the objective difference within itsabsolute unity. It is therefore essentially in its own self syllogism. It is the self−equal universal and this, ascontaining self−repellent negativity, is in the first instance universal, and therefore as yet indeterminate,activity; but because this is negative relation−to−self it determines itself immediately, giving itself themoment of particularity, which, as likewise the totality of the form reflected into itself, is content as againstthe posited differences of the form. Equally immediately this negativity, through its relation−to−self, isabsolute reflection of the form into itself and individuality. On the one hand this reflection is the inneruniversality of the subject, while on the other it is a reflection outwards; and to this extent end is still asubjective end and its activity is directed against external objectivity. § 1604 For end is the Notion that has come to itself in objectivity; the determinateness it has given itself in thatsphere is that of objective indifference to and externality of its determinedness; its self−repellent negativity is,therefore, one whose moments, being determinations only of the Notion itself, also have the form of objectiveindifference to one another. Even in the formal judgement, subject and predicate are determined asself−subsistent in their relationship; but their self−subsistence is so far only abstract universality. It has nowattained the determination of objectivity; but as moment of the Notion, this complete difference is enclosedwithin the simple unity of the Notion. Now in so far as end is this total reflection of objectivity into itself andis so immediately, in the first place, the self−determination or particularity as simple reflection into self isdistinct from the concrete form, and is a determinate content. From this side, end is finite, although in respectof its form it is infinite subjectivity. Secondly, because its determinateness has the form of subjectiveindifference, it has the shape of a presupposition, and from this side its finitude consists in its beingconfronted by an objective, mechanical and chemical world to which its activity relates itself as to somethingalready there; its self−determining activity is thus, in its identity, immediately external to itself and as much Science of LogicChapter 3 Teleology − next section128"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"reflection outwards as reflection−into−self. To this extent end still has a genuinely extramundane existence−− to the extent, namely, that it is confronted by this objectivity, just as the latter on the other hand confrontsit as a mechanical and chemical whole not yet determined and pervaded by the end. § 1605 Accordingly, the movement of end can now be expressed as having for its aim to sublate its presupposition,that is the immediacy of the object, and to posit the object as determined by the Notion. This negative attitudetowards the object is just as much a negative attitude towards itself, a sublating of the subjectivity of the end.Positively, it is the realisation of the end, namely, the union of objective being with it, so that this being,which, as a moment of the end is immediately the determinateness identical with it, shall appear as externaldeterminateness, and conversely the objective as presupposition shall instead be posited as determined by theNotion. End is in its own self the urge to realise itself; the determinateness of the moments of the Notion isexternality; but their simplicity in the unity of the Notion is inadequate to the nature of this unity, and theNotion therefore repels itself from itself. This repulsion is in general the resolution [Entschluss] of therelation of the negative unity to itself, whereby it is exclusive individuality; but by this exclusion[Ausschliessen] it resolves itself [sich entschliesst] or opens up itself [schliesst sich auf], because thisexclusion is a self−determining, as positing of its own self. On the one hand subjectivity in determining itselfmakes itself into particularity, gives itself a content which, enclosed within the unity of the Notion, is still aninner one; but this positing, the simple reflection−into−self, is immediately, as we have seen, also apresupposing; and in the same moment in which the subject of the end determines itself, it is related to anindifferent, external objectivity which is to be equated by it with the said inner determinateness, that is to say,is to be posited as something determined by the Notion, and in the first instance as means. B. THE MEANS § 1606 The first immediate positing in end is at one and the same time the positing of an internality, that is, ofsomething determined as posited, and the presupposing of an objective world which is indifferent to thedetermination of end. But the subjectivity of end is absolute negative unity: its second determining is,therefore, the sublating of this presupposition altogether; this sublating is the return−into−self in so far as byit is sublated that moment of the first negative, the positing of the negative as against the subject, the externalobject. But as against the presupposition or the immediacy of the determining, as against the objective world,it is as yet only the first negation, itself immediate and therefore external. This positing is therefore not yetthe realised end itself, but only the initial step towards it. The object thus determined is so far only the means. § 1607 The end unites itself through a means with objectivity, and in objectivity with itself. The means is the middleterm of the syllogism. The end, because it is finite, requires a means for its realisation−a means, that is amiddle term, that at the same time has the shape of an external existence indifferent to the end itself and itsrealisation. The absolute Notion possesses mediation within itself in such a manner that its first positing is nota presupposing whose object would have indifferent externality for its fundamental determination; on thecontrary, the world as a creation has only the form of such externality, but its fundamental determination isreally constituted by its negativity and positedness. The finitude of end consists accordingly in this, that itsdetermining is altogether external to itself, and so its first determining, as we have seen, divides itself into apositing and a presupposing; therefore the negation of this determining, too, is so far only in one aspectalready a reflection−into−self; in the other, it is in fact merely a first negation; in other words the veryreflection−into−self is also external to itself and a reflection outwards. Science of LogicChapter 3 Teleology − next section129"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"§ 1608 The means is therefore the formal middle term of a formal syllogism; it is external as against the extreme ofthe subjective end, and therefore also to the extreme of the objective end; just as particularity in the formalsyllogism is an indifferent medius terminus that can be replaced by others. Further, just as this particularity ismiddle term only by being determinateness in relation to one extreme and a universal in relation to the other,and therefore owes its mediating determination to its relation to other terms, so the means, too, is only themediating middle term, first because it is an immediate object, secondly because it is a means by virtue of therelation it possesses externally to the extreme of the end −− a relation that is for it a form to which it isindifferent. § 1609 Notion and objectivity are therefore only externally combined in the means, which is accordingly a merelymechanical object. The relation of the object to the end is a premise, or the immediate relation which withregard to the end has been shown to be reflection into itself, the means, is an inhering predicate; itsobjectivity is subsumed under the determination of end which on account of its concretion is universality. Byvirtue of this determination of end present in the means, the latter is now also subsumptive in relation to theother extreme of the initially still indeterminate objectivity. Conversely, in contrast to the subjective end, themeans, as immediate objectivity, has a universality of existence that the subjective individuality of the endstill lacks. The end being thus in the first instance only an external determinateness in the means, it is itself,as a negative unity, outside it; just as the means is a mechanical object that possesses the end only as adeterminateness, not as simple concretion of the totality. As the unifying element, however, the middle termmust itself be the totality of the end. It has been seen that the determination of end in the means is at the sametime reflection−into−self; it is in so far formal self−relation, since the determinateness, as real indifference, isposited as the objectivity of the means. But for this very reason, this, in one respect, pure subjectivity, is atthe same time also activity. In the subjective end the negative relation−to−self is still identical withdeterminateness as such, with content and externality. But in the incipient objectification of the end, in thebecoming−other of the simple Notion, these moments separate themselves, or conversely, it is in suchseparation that this becoming−other or externality consists. § 1610 Consequently, this whole middle term is itself the totality of the syllogism, in which the abstract activity andthe external means constitute the extremes, and their middle term is constituted by that determinateness of theobject by the end, which makes it a means. But further, universality is the relation of the activity of the endand the means. The means is an object, in itself the totality of the Notion; it has no power of resistanceagainst the end, as it has in the first instance against another immediate object. To the end, therefore, which isthe posited Notion, it is absolutely penetrable, and receptive of this communication, because it is in itselfidentical with the end. But now it is also posited as penetrable by the Notion, for in centrality it is an objectstriving towards the negative unity; similarly in chemism, it is as a neutral and also as a different object, nolonger self−subsistent. Its lack of self−subsistence consists precisely in its being only in itself the totality ofthe Notion; but the latter is a being−for−self. Consequently the object has the character of being powerlessagainst the end and of serving it; the end is the object's subjectivity or soul, that has in the object its externalside. § 1611 The object, being in this manner immediately subjected to the end, is not an extreme of the syllogism; but thisrelation constitutes one of its premises. But the means has also a side from which it still has self−subsistenceas against the end. The objectivity that is connected with the end in the means is still external to it, because it Science of LogicChapter 3 Teleology − next section130"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"is only immediately so connected; and therefore the presupposition still persists. The activity of the endthrough the means is for that reason still directed against this presupposition, and the end is activity and nolonger merely an urge and a striving, precisely because the moment of objectivity is posited in the means inits determinateness as something external, and the simple unity of the Notion now has this objectivity as suchin itself. C. THE REALISED END § 1612 1. The end in its relation to the means is already reflected into itself, but its objective return into itself is notyet posited. The activity of the end through its means is still directed against objectivity as an originalpresupposition; the nature of this activity is precisely this, to be indifferent to the determinateness. Were theactivity again to consist in merely determining the immediate objectivity, the product would again be merelya means, and so on to infinity; the outcome would be only a means suitable to the end, but not the objectivityof the end itself. Therefore the end which is active in its means, in determining the immediate object must notdo so as a determinant external to it, and consequently the object must spontaneously conform to the unity ofthe Notion; in other words, the former external activity of the end through its means must determine itself asmediation and sublate its own self. § 1613 The relation of the activity of the end through the means to the external object is in the first instance thesecond premise of the syllogism −− an immediate relation of the middle term to the other extreme. It isimmediate because the middle term has an external object in it and the other extreme is another such object.The means is effective and potent against the latter because its own object is connected with theself−determining activity, while for the other object the immediate determinateness that it possesses is anindifferent one. Their process in this relation is none other than the mechanical or chemical one; in thisobjective externality the previous relationships emerge but under the dominance of the end. These processes,however, as they themselves showed, spontaneously return into the end. If, therefore, in the first instance, therelation of the means to the external object it has to work upon is an immediate one, it has already at anearlier stage exhibited itself as a syllogism, the end having proved itself to be their true middle term andunity. As, therefore, the means is the object that stands on the side of the end and has within it the activity ofthe end, the mechanism that is found here is at the same time the return of objectivity into itself, into theNotion, which however is already presupposed as the end; the negative attitude of purposive activity towardsthe object is thus not an external attitude, but the alteration and transition of objectivity in its own self into theend. § 1614 That the end relates itself immediately to an object and makes it a means, as also that through this means itdetermines another object, may be regarded as violence [Gewalt] in so far as the end appears to be of quiteanother nature than the object, and the two objects similarly are mutually independent totalities. But that theend posits itself in a mediate relation with the object and interposes another object between itself and it, maybe regarded as the cunning of reason. The finitude of rationality has, as remarked, this side, that the endenters into relationship with the presupposition, that is, with the externality of the object. In the immediaterelation to the object, it would itself enter into the sphere of mechanism or chemism and thereby be subject tocontingency and the loss of its determination as the Notion that is in and for itself. But as it is, it puts forwardan object as means, allows it to wear itself out in its stead, exposes it to attrition and shields itself behind itfrom mechanical violence. Science of LogicChapter 3 Teleology − next section131"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"§ 1615 Further, since the end is finite it has a finite content; accordingly it is not an absolute, nor simply somethingthat in its own nature is rational. But the means is the external middle term of the syllogism which is therealisation of the end; in the means, therefore, the rationality in it manifests itself as such by maintainingitself in this external other, and precisely through this externality. To this extent the means is superior to thefinite ends of external purposiveness: the plough is more honourable than are immediately the enjoymentsprocured by it and which are ends. The tool lasts, while the immediate enjoyments pass away and areforgotten. In his tools man possesses power over external nature, even though in respect of his ends he is, onthe contrary, subject to it. § 1616 But the end does not merely keep outside the mechanical process; rather it maintains itself in it and is itsdetermination. The end, as the Notion that freely exists in face of the object and its process and is aself−determining activity, is no less the absolute truth of mechanism, and therefore in mechanism it is onlymeeting with itself. The power of the end over the object is this explicit identity and its activity is themanifestation of it. The end as content is the determinateness that exists in and for itself, which appears in theobject as indifferent and external; but the activity of the end is, on the one hand, the truth of the process andas negative unity the sublating of the illusory show of externality. From the abstract point of view, it is theindifferent determinateness of the object that equally externally is replaced by another; but the simpleabstraction of the determinateness is in its truth the totality of the negative, the concrete Notion that positsexternality within itself. § 1617 The content of the end is its negativity as simple particularity reflected into itself, distinguished from itstotality as form. On account of this simplicity whose determinateness is in and for itself the totality of theNotion, the content appears as the permanently identical element in the realisation of the end. Theteleological process is the translation of the Notion that has a distinct concrete existence as Notion intoobjectivity; this translation into a presupposed other is seen to be the meeting of the Notion with itselfthrough itself. § 1618 Now the content of the end is this identity that has a concrete existence in the form of the identical. In everytransition the Notion maintains itself; for example, when cause becomes effect it is only the cause meetingwith itself in the effect; but in the teleological transition it is the Notion that as such already has a concreteexistence as cause, as the absolute concrete unity that is free in the face of objectivity and its externaldeterminability. The externality into which the end translates itself is itself, as we have seen, already positedas moment of the Notion, as form of its immanent differentiation. The end possesses, therefore, in externalityits own moment; and the content, as content of the concrete unity, is its simple form, which not merelyremains implicitly self−identical in the distinct moments of the end −− as subjective end, as means andmediating activity, and as objective end −− but also has a concrete existence as the abiding self−identical. § 1619 It can therefore be said of the teleological activity that in it the end is the beginning, the consequent theground, the effect the cause, that it is a becoming of what has become, that in it only what already existscomes into existence, and so forth; which means that in general all the determinations of relationshipbelonging to the sphere of reflection or of immediate being have lost their distinctions, and what was Science of LogicChapter 3 Teleology − next section132"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"enunciated as an other, such as end, consequent, effect, etc., no longer has in the end relation thedetermination of an other, but on the contrary is posited as identical with the simple Notion. § 1620 2. Now examining more closely the product of the teleological activity, we see that it contains the end onlyexternally, in so far as it is an absolute presupposition over against the subjective end; that is to say, in so faras we stop short at the point of view that the purposive activity through its' means is only in a mechanicalrelation with the object, and instead of positing one indifferent determinateness of the latter posits anotherequally external to it. A determinateness of this kind, which an object possesses through the end, differs ingeneral from another merely mechanical one by the fact that the former is moment of a unity, so that althoughthe determinateness is indeed external to the object, yet it is not in its own self something merely external.The object that exhibits such a unity is a whole, towards which its parts, its own externality, is indifferent; adeterminate concrete unity which unites within itself distinct relations and determinatenesses. This unitywhich cannot be comprehended from the specific nature of the object, and as regards determinate content isanother content than that peculiar to the object, is not by itself a mechanical determinateness, but it is stillmechanically related to the object. Just as in this product of the purposive activity the content of the end andthe content of the object are external to each other, so a like relation holds between the determinations of thisactivity in the other moments of the syllogism −− in the unifying middle term, between the purposive activityand the object which is means, and in the subjective end, the other extreme, between the infinite form astotality of the Notion and its content. According to the relation by which the subjective end is united withobjectivity, both premises alike −− the relation of the object determined as means to the still external object,and the relation of the subjective end to the object which is made means −− are immediate relations. Thesyllogism therefore suffers from the defect of the formal syllogism in general, that the relations of which itconsists, are not themselves conclusions or mediations, but in fact already presuppose the conclusion forwhose production they are supposed to serve as means. § 1621 If we consider one of the premises, the immediate relation of the subjective end to the object which therebybecomes the means, then the former cannot immediately relate itself to the latter; for the latter is no lessimmediate than the object of the other extreme, in which the end is to be realised through mediation. Sincethey are thus posited as diverse, it is necessary to interpolate between this objectivity and the subjective end ameans of their relation; but this means is likewise an object already determined by the end, and between thatobject's objectivity and the teleological determination a new means must be interpolated, and so on toinfinity. Thus there is posited the infinite progress of mediation. The same thing takes place in respect of theother premise, the relation of the means to the as yet undetermined object. Since they are absolutelyself−subsistent, they can only be united in a third, and so on to infinity. Or conversely, since the premisesalready presuppose the conclusion, the conclusion, being based on these merely immediate premises, canonly be imperfect. The conclusion or the product of the purposive act is nothing but an object determined byan end external to it; consequently it is the same thing as the means. In such a product, therefore, only ameans, not a realised end, has resulted, or the end has not truly attained an objectivity in it. § 1622 It is therefore a matter of complete indifference whether we regard an object determined by external end as arealised end or only as a means; the determination here is relative, external to the object itself and notobjective. All objects, therefore, in which an external end is realised, are equally only a means of the end.Whatever is intended to be used for realising an end and to be taken essentially as means, is a means which,in accordance with its destiny, is to be destroyed. But the object that is supposed to contain the realised end,and to represent the objectivity of the end, is also perishable; it too fulfils its end not by a tranquil existence in Science of LogicChapter 3 Teleology − next section133"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"which it preserves itself, but only in so far as it is worn away; for only thus does it conform to the unity of theNotion, in that its externality, that is, its objectivity, sublates itself in that unity. A house, a clock, may appearas ends in relation to the tools employed for their production; but the stones and beams, or wheels and axles,and so on, which constitute the actuality of the end fulfil that end only through the pressure that they suffer,through the chemical processes with air, light, and water to which they are exposed and that deprive man ofthem by their friction and so forth. Accordingly, they fulfil their destiny only by being used and worn awayand they correspond to what they are supposed to be only through their negation. They are not positivelyunited with the end, because they possess self−determination only externally and are only relative ends, oressentially nothing but means. § 1623 These ends, as we have seen, have in general a limited content; their form is the infinite self−determination ofthe Notion, which through that content has limited itself to an external individuality. The limited contentmakes these ends inadequate to the infinity of the Notion and reduces them to an untruth; such adeterminateness is already through the sphere of necessity, through being, at the mercy of becoming andalteration and must pass away. § 1624 3. Thus we obtain the result that external purposiveness which has as yet only the form of teleology, reallyonly comes to be a means, not an objective end −− because the subjective end remains an external subjectivedetermination; or, in so far as the end is active and realises itself, though only in a means it is still connectedwith the object immediately, immersed in it; it is itself an object, and the end, one may say, does not attain toa means, because the realisation of the end is a prior requirement before that realisation could be broughtabout through a means. § 1625 In fact, however, the result is not only an external end relation, but the truth of it, an internal end relation andan objective end. The externality of the object, self−subsistent as against the Notion, which the endpresupposes for itself is posited in this presupposition as an unessential illusory show and is also alreadysublated in and for itself; the activity of the end is therefore, strictly speaking, only the representation of thisillusory show and the sublating of it. As the Notion has shown us, the first object becomes by communicationa means, because it is in itself totality of the Notion, and its determinateness which is none other thanexternality itself is posited merely as something external and unessential and therefore appears within the enditself as the end's own moment not as a self−subsistent moment relatively to the end. Thus the determinationof the object as a means is purely an immediate one. Accordingly, in order to make that object a means, thesubjective end requires to use no violence against the object, no reinforcement against it other than thereinforcing of itself; the resolve [Entschluss], the explication [Aufschluss], this determination of itself, is themerely posited externality of the object, which appears therein as immediately subjected to the end andpossesses no other determination counter to it than that of the nullity of the being−in−and−for−self. § 1626 The second sublating of objectivity by objectivity differs from the above as follows: the former sublation, asthe first, is the end in objective immediacy, and therefore the second is not merely the sublating of a firstimmediacy but of both, of the objective as something merely posited, and of the immediate. In this way, thenegativity returns into it self in such a manner that it is equally a restoration of the objectivity but of anobjectivity identical with it, and in this it is as at the same time also a positing of the objectivity as an externalobjectivity determined only by the end. Through the latter circumstance this product remains as before also a Science of LogicChapter 3 Teleology − next section134"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"means; through the former it is objectivity that is identical with the Notion, the realised end, in which the sideof being a means is the reality of the end itself. In the realised end the means vanishes, for it would be theobjectivity that is as yet only immediately subsumed under the end, and in the realised end objectivity ispresent as the return of the end into itself; further, with it there also vanishes the mediation itself as a relationof something external, on the one side, into the concrete identity of the objective end, and on the other, intothe same identity as abstract identity and immediacy of existence. § 1627 Herein is also contained the mediation that was demanded for the first premise, the immediate relation of theend to the object. The realised end is also means, and conversely the truth of the means is just this, to be itselfa real end, and the first sublating of objectivity is already also the second, just as the second proved to containthe first, as well. That is to say, the Notion determines itself; its determinateness is external indifference,which is immediately determined in the resolution [Entschluss] as sublated, namely as internal, subjectiveindifference, and at the same time as a presupposed object. Its further passage out from itself which appeared,namely, as an immediate communication and subsumption of the presupposed object under it, is at the sametime a sublating of the former determinateness of externality that was internal and enclosed within theNotion, that is, posited as sublated, and at the same time a sublating of the presupposition of an object;consequently, this apparently first sublating of the indifferent objectivity is already the second as well, areflection−into−self that has passed through mediation, and the realised end. § 1628 Since the Notion here in the sphere of objectivity, where its determinateness has the form of indifferentexternality, is in reciprocal action with itself, the exposition of its movement here becomes doubly difficultand involved, because this movement is itself double and a first is always a second also. In the Notion takenby itself, that is in its subjectivity, its difference from itself appears as an immediate identical totality on itsown account; but since its determinateness here is indifferent externality, its identity with itself in thisexternality is also immediately again self−repulsion, so that what is determined as external and indifferent tothe identity is the identity itself; and the identity as identity, as reflected into itself, is rather its other. Only bykeeping this firmly in mind can we grasp the objective return of the Notion into itself, that is, the trueobjectification of the Notion −− grasp that each of the single moments through which this mediation runs itscourse is itself the entire syllogism of those moments. § 1629 Thus the original inner externality of the Notion through which it is self−repellent unity, the end and thestriving of the end towards objectification, is the immediate positing or presupposition of an external object;the self−determination is also the determination of an external object not determined by the Notion; andconversely, the latter determination is self−determination, that is, externality sublated and posited as internal−− or the certainty of the unessentiality of the external object. Of the second relation, the determination of theobject as means, it has just been shown how it is within itself the mediation of the end in the object withitself. Similarly, the third relation, mechanism, which proceeds under the dominance of the end and sublatesthe object by the object, is on the one hand a sublating of the means, of the object already posited as sublatedand is therefore a second sublating and a reflection−into−self; while on the other hand it is a first determiningof the external object. The latter, as has been remarked, is the production again in the realised end only of ameans; the subjectivity of the finite Notion, contemptuously rejecting the means, has attained to nothingbetter in its goal. But this reflection that the end is reached in the means, and that in the fulfilled end, meansand mediation are preserved, is the last result of the external end−relation, a result in which that relation hassublated itself, and which it has exhibited as its truth. The third syllogism that was considered last isdistinguished by the fact that it is, in the first place, the subjective purposive activity of the preceding Science of LogicChapter 3 Teleology − next section135"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"syllogisms, but is also the spontaneous sublation of external objectivity, and therewith of externality ingeneral, and hence is the totality in its positedness. § 1630 First we saw subjectivity, the Notion's being−for−self, pass over; into its in−itself, objectivity, to be followedby the reappearance in the latter of the negativity of the Notion's being−for−self; in that negativity the Notionhas determined itself in such a manner that its particularity is an external objectivity, or it has determineditself as a simple concrete unity whose externality is its self−determination. The movement of the end has now reached the stage where the moment of externality is not merely posited inthe Notion, where the end is not merely an ought−to−be and a striving to realise itself, but as a concretetotality is identical with the immediate objectivity. This identity is on the one hand the simple Notion and theequally immediate objectivity, but on the other hand, it is just as essentially a mediation, and only through thelatter as a self−sublating mediation is it that simple immediacy; the Notion is therefore essentially this: to bedistinct as an explicit identity from its implicit objectivity, and thereby to possess externality, yet in thisexternal totality to be the totality's self−determining identity. As such, the Notion is now the Idea. The Doctrine of the Notion Section Three: The IdeaLife − Cognition − The Absolute Idea § 1631 The Idea is the adequate Notion, that which is objectively true, or the true as such. When anything whateverpossesses truth, it possesses it through its Idea, or, something possesses truth only in so far as it is Idea. Theexpression 'idea' has often been employed in philosophy as in ordinary life for 'notion', indeed, even for amere ordinary conception: 'I have no idea yet of this lawsuit, building, neighbourhood', means nothing morethan the ordinary conception. Kant has reclaimed the expression Idea for the notion of reason. Now accordingto Kant, the notion of reason is supposed to be the notion of the unconditioned, but a notion transcendent inregard to phenomena, that is, no empirical use can be made of such notion that is adequate to it. The notionsof reason are to serve for the comprehension of perceptions, the notions of the understanding forunderstanding them. But in fact, if the latter really are Notions, then they are Notions −− they enable one tocomprehend , and an understanding of perceptions by means of notions of the understanding will be acomprehension of them. § 1632 But if understanding is only a determining of perceptions by such categories as for example whole and parts,force, cause, and the like, it signifies only a determining by reflection; and similarly, by understanding can bemeant only the specific representation of a completely determined sensuous content; thus when someone,having been directed that at the end of the wood he must turn left, replies 'I understand', understanding meansnothing more than the grasping of something in pictorial thought and in memory. 'Notion of reason', too, is asomewhat clumsy expression; for the Notion is something altogether rational; and in so far as reason isdistinguished from understanding and the Notion as such, it is the totality of the Notion and of objectivity. Inthis sense the Idea is the rational; it is the unconditioned, because only that has conditions which essentiallyrelates itself to an objectivity, but an objectivity that it has not itself determined but which still confronts it inthe form of indifference and externality, just as the external end still had conditions. § 1633 Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion Section Three: The Idea136"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Reserving then the expression 'Idea' for the objective or real Notion and distinguishing it from the Notionitself and still more from mere pictorial thought, we must also reject even more vigorously that estimate ofthe Idea according to which it is not anything actual, and true thoughts are said to be only ideas. If thoughtsare merely subjective and contingent, they certainly have no further value; but in this respect they are notinferior to temporal and contingent actualities which likewise have no further value than that of contingenciesand phenomena. On the other hand if, conversely, the Idea is not to have the value of truth, because in regardto phenomena it is transcendent, and no congruent object can be assigned to it in the world of sense, this is anodd misunderstanding that would deny objective validity to the Idea because it lacks that which constitutesAppearance, namely, the untrue being of the objective world. In regard to practical Ideas, Kant recognisesthat 'nothing can be more harmful and unworthy of a philosopher than the vulgar appeal to an experience thatallegedly conflicts with the Idea. This very experience would not even exist if, for example, politicalinstitutions had been established at the proper time in conformity with Ideas, and if crude conceptions, crudejust because they had been drawn from experience, had not taken the place of Ideas and so nullified everygood intention.' Kant regards the Idea as a necessity and as the goal which, as the archetype, it must be ourendeavour to set up for a maximum and to which we must strive to bring the condition of the actual worldever nearer. § 1634 But having reached the result that the Idea is the unity of the Notion and objectivity, is the true, it must not beregarded merely as a goal to which we have to approximate but which itself always remains a kind of beyond;on the contrary, we must recognise that everything actual is only in so far as it possesses the Idea andexpresses it. It is not merely that the object, the objective and subjective world in general, ought to becongruous with the Idea, but they are themselves the congruence of Notion and reality; the reality that doesnot correspond to the Notion is mere Appearance, the subjective, contingent, capricious element that is notthe truth. § 1635 When it is said that no object is to be found in experience that is perfectly congruous with the Idea, one isopposing the Idea as a subjective standard to the actual; but what anything actual is supposed in truth to be, ifits Notion is not in it and if its objectivity docs not correspond to its Notion at all, it is impossible to say; for itwould be nothing. It is true that the mechanical and chemical object, like the nonspiritual subject and thespirit that is conscious only of the finite, not of its essence, do not, according to their various natures, havetheir Notion existent in them in its own free form. But they can only be true at all in so far as they are the union of their Notion and reality, of their soul andtheir body. Wholes like the state and the church cease to exist when the unity of their Notion and their realityis dissolved; man, the living being, is dead when soul and body are parted in him; dead nature, themechanical and chemical world −− taking, that is, the dead world to mean the inorganic world, otherwise itwould have no positive meaning at all −− dead nature, then, if it is separated into its Notion and its reality, isnothing but the subjective abstraction of a thought form and a formless matter. Spirit that was not Idea, wasnot the unity of the Notion with its own self, or the Notion that did not have the Notion itself for its realitywould be dead, spiritless spirit, a material object. § 1636 The Idea being the unity of Notion and reality, being has attained the significance of truth; therefore whatnow is is only what is Idea. Finite things are finite because they do not possess the complete reality of theirNotion within themselves, but require other things to complete it −− or, conversely, because they arepresupposed as objects, hence possess the Notion as an external determination.

That the Idea has not completely leavened its reality, has imperfectly subdued it to theNotion, this is a possibility arising from the fact that the Idea itself has a restricted content, that though it isessentially the unity of Notion and reality, it is no less essentially their difference; for only the object is theirimmediate, that is, merely implicit unity. But if an object, for example the state, did not correspond at all toits Idea, that is, if in fact it was not the Idea of the state at all, if its reality, which is the self−consciousindividuals, did not correspond at all to the Notion, its soul and its body would have parted; the former wouldescape into the solitary regions of thought, the latter would have broken up into the single individualities. § 1637 But because the Notion of the state so essentially constitutes the nature of these individualities, it is present inthem as an urge so powerful that they are impelled to translate it into reality, be it only in the form of externalpurposiveness, or to put up with it as it is, or else they must needs perish. The worst state, one whose realityleast corresponds to the Notion, in so far as it still exists, is still Idea; the individuals still obey a dominantNotion. § 1638 However, the Idea has not merely the more general meaning of the true being, of the unity of Notion andreality, but the more specific one of the unity of subjective Notion and objectivity. That is to say, the Notionas such is itself already the identity of itself and reality; for the indefinite expression 'reality' means in generalnothing else but determinate being, and this the Notion possesses in its particularity and individuality.Similarly too, objectivity is the total Notion that out of its determinateness has withdrawn into identity withitself. In the former subjectivity the determinateness or difference of the Notion is an illusory being[semblance] that is immediately sublated and has withdrawn into being−for−self or negative unity; it is aninhering predicate. But in this objectivity the determinateness is posited as an immediate totality, as anexternal whole. Now the Idea has shown itself to be the Notion liberated again into its subjectivity from theimmediacy in which it is submerged in the object; to he the Notion that distinguishes itself from itsobjectivity, which however is no less determined by it and possesses its substantiality only in that Notion.'This identity has therefore rightly been defined as the subject−object, for it is as well the formal or subjectiveNotion as it is the object as such. But this must be understood more precisely. The Notion, having trulyattained its reality, is this absolute judgement whose subject, as self−related negative unity, distinguishesitself from its objectivity and is the latter's being−in−and−for−self, but essentially relates itself to it throughitself; it is therefore its own end and the urge to realise it; but for this very reason the subject does not possessobjectivity in an immediate manner, for if it did it would be merely the totality of the object as such lost inobjectivity; on the contrary, objectivity is the realisation of the end, an objectivity posited by the activity ofthe end, an objectivity which, as positedness, possesses its subsistence and its form only as permeated by itssubject. As objectivity, it has in it the moment of the externality of the Notion and is therefore in general theside of finitude, change and Appearance, a side, however, which meets with extinction in its retraction intothe negative unity of the Notion; the negativity whereby its indifferent mutual externality exhibits itself asunessential and a positivity, is the Notion itself. § 1639 The Idea is, therefore, in spite of this objectivity utterly simple and immaterial, for the externality exists onlyas determined by the Notion and as taken up into its negative unity; in so far as it exists as indifferentexternality it is not merely at the mercy of mechanism in general but exists only as the transitory and untrue.Although therefore the Idea has its reality in a material externality, this is not an abstract being subsisting on Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion Section Three: The Idea138"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"its own account over against the Notion; on the contrary, it exists only as a becoming through the negativityof indifferent being, as a simple determinateness of the Notion. § 1640 This yields the following more precise definitions of the Idea. First, it is the simple truth, the identity of theNotion and objectivity as a universal in which the opposition and subsistence of the particular is dissolvedinto its self−identical negativity and is equality with itself. Secondly, it is the relation of the explicitsubjectivity of the simple Notion and its objectivity which is distinguished therefrom; the former isessentially the urge to sublate this separation, and the latter is the indifferent positedness, the subsistence thatis in and for itself null. As this relation, the Idea is the process of sundering itself into individuality and its inorganic nature, andagain of bringing this inorganic nature under the power of the subject and returning to the first simpleuniversality. The identity of the Idea with itself is one with the process; the thought which liberates actualityfrom the illusory show of purposeless mutability and transfigures it into the Idea must not represent this truthof actuality as a dead repose, as a mere picture, lifeless, without impulse or movement, as a genius or number,or an abstract thought; by virtue of the freedom which the Notion attains in the Idea, the Idea possesseswithin itself also the most stubborn opposition; its repose consists in the security and certainty with which iteternally creates and eternally overcomes that opposition, in it meeting with itself. > § 1641 In the first instance, however, the Idea is once again only immediate or only in its Notion; objective reality is,it is true, conformable to the Notion, but it is not yet liberated into the Notion, and the latter does not existexplicitly for itself as Notion. immediate, that is, its determinateness does not appear as soul itself, it has not grasped itself as soul, it doesnot possess its objective reality within itself; the Notion is as a soul that is not yet fully a soul. § 1642 At this first stage the Idea is Life: the Notion that, distinguished from its objectivity, simple within itself,pervades its objectivity and, as its own end, possesses its means in the objectivity and posits the latter as itsmeans, yet is immanent in this means and is therein the realised end that is identical with itself. This Idea, onaccount of its immediacy, has individuality for the form of its existence. But the reflection−into−self of itsabsolute process is the sublating of this immediate individuality; thereby the Notion which, as universality inthis individuality, is the inwardness of the latter, converts the externality into universality, or posits itsobjectivity as being the same as itself. § 1643 In this second stage, the Idea is the Idea of the true and the good as cognition and volition . In the firstinstance, it is finite cognition and finite volition, in which the true and the good are still distinguished andeach appears as yet only as a goal. The Notion has, in the first instance, liberated itself into itself and as yetgiven itself only an abstract objectivity for its reality. But the process of this finite cognition and actionconverts the initially abstract universality into a totality, whereby it becomes a complete objectivity. Or, toconsider it from the other side, finite, that is, subjective spirit, makes for itself the presupposition of anobjective world, just as life has such a presupposition; but its activity consists in sublating this presupposition Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion Section Three: The Idea139"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"and converting it into a positedness. In this way its reality is for it the objective world, or conversely, theobjective world is the ideality in which it cognises itself. § 1644 Thirdly, spirit cognises the Idea as its absolute truth, as the truth that is in and for itself; the infinite Idea inwhich cognition and action are equalised, and which is the absolute knowledge of itself. Chapter 1 Life§ 1645 The Idea of Life is concerned with a subject matter so concrete, and if you will, so real, that with it we mayseem to have overstepped the domain of logic as it is commonly conceived. Certainly, if logic were to containnothing but empty, dead forms of thought, there could be no mention init at all of such a content as the Ideaof Life. But if absolute truth is the subject matter of logic, and truth as such is essentially in cognition, thencognition at least would have to be discussed. So called pure logic is usually followed up with an appliedlogic −− a logic dealing with concrete cognition, not to mention the mass of psychology and anthropologythat it is often deemed necessary to interpolate into logic. But the anthropological and psychological side ofcognition is concerned with its manifested aspect, in which the Notion on its own account has not yet come tohave an objectivity the same as itself, that is, to have itself for object. The part of logic that treats of thisconcrete side does not belong to applied logic as such; if it did, then every science would have to be draggedinto logic, for each is an applied logic in so far as it consists in apprehending its subject matter in forms ofthought and the Notion. The subjective Notion has presuppositions which present themselves inpsychological, anthropological and other forms. But to logic belong only the presuppositions of the pureNotion in so far as they have the form of pure thoughts, of abstract essentialities, that is, the determinations ofbeing and essence. Similarly, in respect of cognition, the Notion's apprehension of itself, logic will not dealwith other shapes of its presupposition but only with that which is itself Idea; this latter, however, necessarilyfalls to be dealt with in logic. Now this presupposition is the immediate Idea; for since cognition is the Notionin so far as this is for itself but as a subjectivity is in relation to an objectivity, the Notion is related to the Ideaas presupposed or immediate Idea. But the immediate Idea is life. § 1646 To this extent the necessity of treating of the Idea of life in logic would be based on the necessity, otherwiserecognised, too, of treating here of the concrete Notion of cognition. But this Idea has come upon the scenethrough the Notion's own necessity; the Idea, that which is true in and for itself, is essentially the subjectmatter of logic; since it is at first to be considered in its immediacy, it must be apprehended and cognised inthis determinateness in which it is life, in order that its treatment shall not be an empty affair devoid ofdeterminate content. All that we need perhaps to remark is how far the logical view of life differs from anyother scientific view of it; this is not the place, however, to concern ourselves with how life is treated in theunphilosophical sciences, but only with differentiating logical life as pure Idea from natural life which is dealtwith in the philosophy of nature, and from life in so far as it stands in connection with spirit. The former ofthese, as the life of nature, is life as projected into the externality of existence and having its condition ininorganic nature, and where the moments of the Idea are a multiplicity of actual formations. Life in the Idea iswithout such presuppositions which are in the form of shapes of actuality; its presupposition is the Notion aswe have considered it, on the one hand as subjective, on the other hand as objective. In nature life appears asthe highest stage, a stage that nature's externality attains by withdrawing into itself and sublating itself insubjectivity. In Logic it is simple inwardness [Insichsein], which in the Idea of life has attained an externalitythat genuinely corresponds to it; the Notion that earlier appeared on the scene as subjective Notion is the soul Science of LogicChapter 1 Life140"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"of life itself; it is the urge that mediates for itself its reality throughout objectivity. Nature, having reachedthis Idea from the starting point of its externality, transcends itself; its end does not appear as its beginning,but as its limit, in which it sublates itself. Similarly, in the Idea of life the moments of its reality do notreceive the shape of external actuality but remain enclosed within the form of the Notion. § 1647 In spirit, however, life appears partly as opposed to it, partly as posited as at one with it, this unity beingreborn as the pure offspring of spirit. For here life is to be taken generally in its proper sense as natural life,for what is called the life of spirit as spirit, is its peculiar nature that stands opposed to mere life; just as wespeak, too, of the nature of spirit, although spirit is not a natural being and is rather the opposite of nature.Life as such, then, is for spirit partly a means, and as such spirit opposes it to itself; partly spirit is a livingindividual and life is its body; and again, this unity of spirit with its living corporeality is born from spirititself as an ideal. None of these relations to spirit concerns logical life and life is to be considered here neitheras instrument [Mittel] of a spirit, nor as a moment of the ideal and of beauty. In both cases, as natural life andas life standing in relation with spirit, life possesses a determinateness of its externality, in the first casethrough its presuppositions which are other formations of nature, in the second case through the ends and theactivity of spirit. The Idea of life by itself is free from the former presupposed and conditioning objectivity aswell as from relation to the latter subjectivity. § 1648 Life, considered now more closely in its Idea, is in and for itself absolute universality; the objectivity that itpossesses is permeated throughout by the Notion and has the Notion alone for substance. What isdistinguished as part, or in accordance with some other external reflection, has within itself the whole Notion;the Notion is the omnipresent soul in it, which remains simple self−relation and remains a one in themultiplicity belonging to objective being. This multiplicity, as self−external objectivity, has an indifferentsubsistence, which in space and time, if these could already be mentioned here, is a mutual externality ofwholly diverse and self−subsistent elements. But in life externality is at the same time present as the simpledeterminateness of its Notion; thus the soul is an omnipresent outpouring of itself into this multiplicity and atthe same remains absolutely the simple oneness of the concrete Notion with itself. The thinking that clings tothe determinations of the relationships of reflection and of the formal Notion, when it comes to consider life,this unity of its Notion in the externality of objectivity, in the absolute multiplicity of atomistic matter, findsall its thoughts without exception are of no avail; the omnipresence of the simple in manifold externality isfor reflection an absolute contradiction, and as reflection must at the same time apprehend this omnipresencefrom its perception of life and therefore admit the actuality of this Idea, it is an incomprehensible mystery forit, because it does not grasp the Notion, and the Notion as the substance of life. This simple life, however, isnot only omnipresent; it is absolutely the subsistence and immanent substance of its objectivity; but assubjective substance it is the urge, and moreover the specific urge, of the particular difference, and no lessessentially the one and universal urge of the specialised difference that reduces this its particularisation intounity and maintains it therein. It is only as this negative unity of its objectivity and particularisation that life isa self−related life that is for itself, a soul. As such it is essentially an individual, which relates itself toobjectivity as to an other, to a non−living nature. Consequently the original judgment of life consists in this, that it detaches itself as an individual subject fromobjectivity, and in constituting itself the negative unity of the Notion, makes the presupposition of animmediate objectivity. § 1649 Science of LogicChapter 1 Life141"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Life is therefore first to be considered as a living individual that is for itself the subjective totality and ispresupposed as indifferent to an objectivity that confronts it as indifferent. § 1650 Secondly, it is the life process, the process of sublating its presupposition, positing as negative the objectivitythat is indifferent to it and actualising itself as that objectivity's power and negative unity. By so doing itmakes itself into the universal that is the unity of itself and its other. § 1651 Hence life is thirdly the genus process, the process of sublating its individualisation and relating itself to itsobjective existence as to itself. Accordingly, this process is on the one hand the return to its Notion and therepetition of the first diremption, the becoming of a new individuality and the death of the first, immediateone; but on the other hand, the Notion of life that has withdrawn into itself is the becoming of the Notion thatis in relationship with itself and exists universally and freely for itself − the transition into cognition. A The Living IndividualB The Life ProcessC The Genus [Kind]Chapter 2 The Idea of Cognition§ 1677 Life is the immediate Idea, or the Idea as its Notion not yet realised in its own self. In its judgement, the Ideais cognition in general. The Notion is, as Notion, for itself in so far as it freely exists as abstract universality or as genus. As such, itis its pure self−identity, which inwardly differentiates itself in such a manner that the differentiated momentis not an objectivity, but is likewise liberated into subjectivity or the form of simple selflikeness, and hencethe object of the Notion is the Notion itself. Its reality in general is the form of its determinate being and thepoint of interest is the determination this form, on this determination rests the difference between what theNotion is in itself or as subjective and what it is when submerged in objectivity, and then in the Idea of life. § 1678 In the latter it is indeed distinguished from its external reality and posited for itself, yet this its being−for−selfit possesses only as the identity that is a relation to itself as submerged in its subjugated objectivity, or toitself as indwelling, substantial form. The elevation of the Notion above life means that its reality is theNotion form liberated into universality. Through this judgement the Idea is duplicated into the subjectiveNotion whose reality is the Notion itself, and into the objective Notion that is in the form of life. Thinking,spirit, self−consciousness, are determinations of the Idea where it has itself for object, and its determinatebeing, that is, the determinateness of its being, is its own difference from itself. § 1679 The metaphysics of the spirit, or, as it was more commonly expressed, of the soul revolved round thedeterminations of substance, simplicity, immateriality −− determinations in which the general idea of spirittaken from empirical consciousness, was laid down as subject, and it was then asked, What predicates agreewith our observations? This kind of procedure could get no further than the procedure of physics, which Science of LogicChapter 2 The Idea of Cognition142"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"reduces the world of phenomena to general laws and reflective determinations since it too was based on spiritmerely in its phenomenal aspect; in fact this procedure was bound to fall short even of the scientific characterof physics. § 1680 Since spirit is not only infinitely richer than nature, but also, its essence is constituted by the absolute unity ofopposites in the Notion, it exhibits in its phenomenal aspect and relation to externality contradiction in itsextreme form. Consequently, it must be possible to adduce an experience in support of each of the opposedreflective determinations, or starting from experience it must be possible to arrive at opposite determinationsby way of formal syllogistic reasoning. § 1681 Since the predicates immediately yielded by spirit's phenomenal aspect in the first instance still belong toempirical Psychology, there only remain, strictly speaking, for the metaphysical consideration, the whollyinadequate determinations of reflection. Kant, in his criticism of rational psychology adheres to thismetaphysics, insisting that, in so far as rational psychology purports to be a rational science, the smallestaddition from observation to the general idea of selfconsciousness would transform that science into anempirical one and mar its rational purity and its independence of all experience. Consequently, on this view,nothing is left but the simple representation, 'I', a representation devoid of any content of its own, of whichwe cannot even say that it is a notion but a mere consciousness that accompanies every notion. Nowaccording to the further Kantian conclusions, by this 'I', or if you like, it (the thing) that thinks, nothingfurther is represented than a transcendental subject of thoughts = x, which is cognised only through thethoughts which are its predicates, and of which, taken in its isolation, we can never have the least conception. In this context, the 'I' has the inconvenience, to use Kant's own expression that we must already make use ofit whenever we want make any judgement about it; for it is not so much a single representation by which aparticular object is distinguished, but rather a form of representation in general in so far as this is to be calledcognition. Now the paralogism committed by rational psychology, says Kant, consists in this, that modes ofself−consciousness in thinking are converted into notions of the understanding as applied to an object; thatthe 'I think' is taken as a thinking being, a thing−in−itself; and that in this way, from the fact that I alwaysoccur in consciousness as a subject, and that too as a singular subject, identical in all the multiplicity ofrepresentation, and distinguishing myself from the latter as from something external to me, the unjustifiedinference is drawn that the 'I' is a substance, and further a qualitatively simple being, and a one, andsomething that has a real existence independently of the things of time and space. § 1682 I have drawn out this exposition in some detail, because it shows clearly the nature of the previousmetaphysics of the soul and especially, too, the nature of the criticism by which it was made obsolete. Theformer aimed at determining the abstract essence of the soul; in doing so, it started originally fromobservation and converted the empirical universality of observation and the wholly external reflectivedetermination attaching to the individuality of the actual, into the form of the above−mentioneddeterminations of essence. Kant in his criticism had generally in mind only the state of the metaphysics of histime, which in the main adhered to these abstract, one−sided determinations wholly devoid of dialectic; thegenuinely speculative ideas of older philosophers on the notion of spirit he neither heeded nor examined. Inhis criticism then of those determinations, he followed quite simply Hume's style of scepticism; that is to say,he holds fast to the 'I' as it appears in self−consciousness, from which, however, since it is its essence −− thething−in−itself −− that we are to cognise, −− everything empirical must be omitted; nothing then is left butthis phenomenon of the 'I think' that accompanies every representation −− of which 'I think' we have not the Science of LogicChapter 2 The Idea of Cognition143"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"slightest conception. § 1683 Certainly, it must be conceded that we have not the least conception the 'I', or of anything whatever, not evenof the Notion itself, so long as we do not really think, but stop short at the simple, fixed general idea and thename. It is an odd thought −− if it can be called a thought at all −− that I must already make use of the 'I' inorder to judge of the 'I'; the 'I' that makes use of self−consciousness as a means in order to judge, this isindeed an x of which, as well as of the relationship of such 'making use', we cannot have the slightestconception. But surely it is ridiculous to call this nature of self−consciousness, namely, that the 'I' thinksitself, that the 'I' cannot be thought without its being the 'I' that thinks, an inconvenience and, as though therewas a fallacy in it, a circle. It is this relationship through which, in immediate self−consciousness, theabsolute, eternal nature of self−consciousness and the Notion itself manifests itself, and manifests itself forthis reason, that self−consciousness is just the existent pure Notion, and therefore empirically perceptible, theabsolute relation−to−self that, as a separating judgement, makes itself its own object and is solely this processwhereby it makes itself a circle. § 1684 A stone does not have this inconvenience; when it is to be thought or judged it does not stand in its own way.It is relieved from the burden of making use of itself for this task; it is something else outside it that must giveitself this trouble. Kant's Critique of Rational PsychologyA The Idea of the True § 1698 The subjective Idea is in the first instance an urge. For it is the contradiction of the Notion to have itself forobject and to be its own reality, yet without the object being an other, that is, self−subsistent over against it,or without the difference of the Notion from itself possessing at the same time the essential determination ofdiversity and indifferent existence. The specific nature of this urge is therefore to sublate its own subjectivity,to make its first, abstract reality into a concrete one and to fill it with the content of the world presupposed byits subjectivity. § 1699 From the other side, this urge is determined in the following manner: the Notion is, it is true, the absolutecertainty of itself; but its being−for−self is confronted by its presupposition of a world having the form ofimplicit being, but a world whose indifferent otherness has for the self−certainty of the Notion the valuemerely of an unessentiality; it is thus the urge to sublate this otherness and to intuit in the object its identitywith itself. This reflection−into−self is the sublated opposition, and the individuality which initially appearsas the presupposed implicit being of a world is now posited as individuality and made actual for the subject;accordingly the reflection−into−self is the self−identity of the form restored out of the opposition −− anidentity that is therefore determined as indifferent to the form in its distinctiveness and is content. § 1700 This urge is therefore the urge to truth in so far as truth is in cognition, accordingly to truth in its proper sense Science of LogicKant's Critique of Rational Psychology144"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"as theoretical Idea. Objective truth is no doubt the Idea itself as the reality that corresponds to the Notion, andto this extent an object may or may not possess truth; but, on the other hand, the more precise meaning oftruth is that it is truth for or in the subjective Notion, in knowing. It is the relation of the Notion judgmentwhich showed itself to be the formal judgment of truth; in it, namely, the predicate is not merely theobjectivity of the Notion, but the relating comparison of the Notion of the subject−matter with its actuality.This realisation of the Notion is theoretical in so far as the Notion, as form, has still the determination ofsubjectivity, or has still the determination for the subject of being its own determination. Because cognition isthe Idea as end as subjective, the negation of the world presupposed as an implicit being is the first negation;therefore also the conclusion in which the objective is posited in the subjective, has at first only this meaning,that the implicit being is only posited in the form of subjectivity, or in the Notion determination, and for thisreason is not, in that form, in and for itself. Thus the conclusion only attains to a neutral unity or a synthesis,that is, to a unity of things that are originally separate and only are externally so conjoined. Since therefore inthis cognition the Notion posits the object as its own, the Idea in the first instance only gives itself a contentwhose basis is given, and in which only the form of externality has been sublated. § 1701 Accordingly, this cognition still retains its finitude in its realised end; in its realised end it has at the sametime not attained its end, and in its truth has not yet arrived at truth. For in so far as in the result the contentstill has the character of a datum, the presupposed implicit being confronting the Notion is not sublated;equally therefore the unity of Notion and reality, truth, is also not contained in it. Oddly enough, it is his sideof finitude that latterly has been clung to, and accepted as the absolute relation of cognition −− as though thefinite as such was supposed to be the absolute! At this standpoint, the object is credited with being anunknown thing−in−itself behind cognition, and this character of the object, and with it truth too is regarded asan absolute beyond for cognition. In this view of cognition, thought determinations in general, the categories,reflective determinations, as well as the for Notion and its moments are assigned the position of being finitedeterminations not in and for themselves, but finite in the sense that they are subjective in rely on to thisempty thing−in−itself, the fallacy of taking this untrue relation of cognition as the true relation has becomethe universal opinion of modern times. § 1702 From this determination of finite cognition it is immediately evident that it is a contradiction that sublatesitself −− the contradiction of a truth that at the same time is supposed not to be truth −− of a cognition ofwhat is, which at the same time does not cognise the thing−in−itself. In the collapse of this contradiction, itscontent, subjective cognition and the thing−in−itself, collapses, that is, proves itself an untruth. But cognitionmust, in the course of its own movement, resolve its finitude and with it its contradiction; this examination ofit made by us is an external reflection; but cognition is itself the Notion, the Notion that is its own end andtherefore through its realisation fulfils itself, and in this very fulfilment sublates its subjectivity and thepresupposed implicit being. We have therefore to consider cognition in its own self in its positive activity.Since this Idea is, as we have seen, the urge of the Notion to realise itself for itself, its activity consists indetermining the object, and by this determining to relate itself in the object identically to itself. The object isin general something simply determinable, and in the Idea it has this essential side of not being in and foritself opposed to the Notion. Because cognition is still finite, not speculative, cognition, the presupposedobjectivity has not as yet for it the shape of something that is in its own self simply and solely the Notion andthat contains nothing with a particularity of its own as against the latter. § 1703 But the fact that it counts as an implicit beyond, necessarily implies that its determinability by the Notion is adetermination it possesses essentially; for the Idea is the Notion that exists for itself, is that which is Science of LogicKant's Critique of Rational Psychology145"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"absolutely infinite within itself, in which the object is implicitly sublated and the end is now solely to sublateit explicitly. Hence, though the object is presupposed by the Idea of cognition as possessing an implicit being,yet it is essentially in a relationship where the Idea, certain of itself and of the nullity of this opposition,comes to the realisation of its Notion in the object. § 1704 In the syllogism whereby the subjective Idea now unites itself with objectivity, the first premise is the sameform of immediate seizure and relation of the Notion to the object that we saw in the relation of end. Thedetermining activity of the Notion upon the object is an immediate communication of itself to the object andunresisted pervasion of the latter by the Notion. In this process the Notion remains in pure identity with itself;but this its immediate reflection−into−self has equally the determination of objective immediacy; that whichfor the Notion is its own determination, is equally a being, for it is the first negation of the presupposition.Therefore the posited determination ranks just as much as a presupposition that has been merely found, as anapprehension of a datum; in fact the activity of the Notion here consists merely in being negative towardsitself, restraining itself and making itself passive towards what confronts it, in order that the latter may beable to show itself, not as determined by the subject, but as it is in its own self. § 1705 Accordingly in this premise this cognition does not appear even as an application of logical determinations,but as an acceptance and apprehension of them just as given, and its activity appears to be restricted merely tothe removal of a subjective obstacle, an external husk, from the subject−matter. This cognition is analyticcognition. (a) Analytic Cognition § 1706 We sometimes find the difference between analytic and synthetic cognition stated in the form that oneproceeds from the known to the unknown, the other from the unknown to the known. But if this distinction isclosely examined, it will be difficult to discover in it a definite thought, much less a Notion. § 1707 It may be said that cognition begins in general with ignorance, for one does not learn to know something withwhich one is already acquainted. Conversely, it also begins with the known; this is a tautological proposition;that with which it begins, which therefore it actually cognises, is ipso facto something known; what is not asyet known and is to be known only later is still an unknown. So far, then, it must be said that cognition, onceit has begun, always proceeds from the known to the unknown. § 1708 The distinguishing feature of analytic cognition is already defined in the fact that as the first premise of thewhole syllogism, analytic cognition does not as yet contain mediation; it is the immediate communication ofthe Notion and does not as yet contain otherness, and in it the activity empties itself of its negativity.However, this immediacy of the relation is for that reason itself a mediation, for it is the negative relation ofthe Notion to the object, but a relation that annuls itself, thereby making itself simple and identical. Thisreflection−into−self is only subjective, because in its mediation the difference is present still only in the formof the presupposed implicit difference, as difference of the object within itself. The determination, therefore,brought about by this relation, is the form of simple identity, of abstract universality. Accordingly, analytic Science of LogicKant's Critique of Rational Psychology146"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"cognition has in general this identity for its principle; and transition into an other, the connection of differentterms, is excluded from itself and from its activity. § 1709 If we look now more closely at analytic cognition, we see that it starts from a presupposed, and thereforeindividual, concrete subject matter; this may be an object already complete in itself for ordinary thought, or itmay be a problem, that is to say, given only in its circumstances and conditions, but not yet disengaged fromthem and presented on its own account in simple self−subsistence. Now the analysis of this subject mattercannot consist in its being merely resolved into the particular picture thoughts which it may contain; such aresolution and the apprehension of such picture thoughts is a business that would not belong to cognition, butwould merely be a matter of a closer acquaintance, a determination within the sphere of picture−thinking.Since analysis is based on the Notion, its products are essentially Notion−determinations, and that too asdeterminations immediately contained in the subject matter. § 1710 We have seen from the nature of the Idea of cognition, that the activity of the subjective Notion must beregarded from one side merely as the explication of what is already in the object, because the object itself isnothing but the totality of the Notion. It is just as one−sided to represent analysis as though there werenothing in the subject matter that was not imported into it, as it is one−sided to suppose that the resultingdeterminations are merely extracted from it. The former view, as everyone knows, is enunciated by subjectiveidealism, which takes the activity of cognition in analysis to be merely a one−sided positing, beyond whichthe thing−in−itself remains concealed; the other view belongs to so−called realism which apprehends thesubjective Notion as an empty Identity that receives the thought determinations into itself from outside.Analytic cognition, the transformation of the given material into logical determinations, has shown itself tobe two things in one: a positing that no less immediately determines itself as a presupposing. Consequently,by virtue of the latter, the logical element may appear as something already complete in the object, just as byvirtue of the former it may appear as the product of a merely subjective activity. But the two moments are notto be separated; the logical element in its abstract form into which analysis raises it, is of course only to befound in cognition, while conversely it is something not merely posited, but possessing being in itself. § 1711 Now since analytic cognition is the transformation indicated above, it does not pass through any furthermiddle term; the determination is in so far immediate and has just this meaning, to be peculiar to the objectand in itself to belong to it, and therefore to be apprehended from it without any subjective mediation. Butfurther, cognition is supposed also to be a progress, an explication of differences. But because, in accordancewith the determination it has here, it is Notion−less and undialectical, it possesses only a given difference,and its progress takes place solely in the determinations of the material. It seems to have an immanentprogress only in so far as the derived thought determinations can be analysed afresh, in so far as they are aconcrete; the highest and ultimate point of this process of analysis is the abstract highest essence, or abstractsubjective identity −− and over against it, diversity. § 1712 This progress is, however, nothing but the mere repetition of the one original act of analysis, namely, thefresh determination as a concrete, of what has already been taken up into the abstract form of the Notion; thisis followed by the analysis of it, then by the determination afresh as a concrete of the abstract that emergesfrom it, and so forth. But the thought determinations seem also to contain a transition within themselves. Ifthe object is determined as a whole, then of course one advances from this to the other determination of part, Science of LogicKant's Critique of Rational Psychology147"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"from cause to the other determination of effect, and so on. But here this is no advance, since whole and part,cause and effect, are relationships and moreover, for this formal cognition, relationships complete inthemselves such that in them one determination is already found essentially linked to the other. The subjectmatter that has been determined as cause or as part is ipso facto determined by the whole relationship, that is,determined already by both sides of it. Although the relationship is in itself something synthetic, yet foranalytic cognition this connection is as much a mere datum as any other connection of its material andtherefore is not relevant to its own peculiar business. Whether a connection of this kind be otherwisedetermined as a priori or a posteriori is here a matter of indifference, for it is apprehended as something foundalready there, or, as it has also been described, as a fact of consciousness that with the determination whole islinked the determination part, and so forth. While Kant has made the profound observation that there aresynthetic a priori principles and has recognised their root in the unity of self−consciousness and therefore inthe identity of the Notion with itself, yet he adopts the specific connection, the concepts of relation and thesynthetic principles themselves from formal logic as given; their justification should have been the expositionof the transition of that simple unity of self−consciousness into these its determinations and distinctions, butKant spared himself the trouble of demonstrating this genuinely synthetic progress −− the self−producingNotion. Analytical Science(b) Synthetic Cognition § 1720 Analytic cognition is the first premise of the whole syllogism −− the immediate relation of the Notion to theobject; identity, therefore, is the determination which it recognises as its own, and analytic cognition ismerely the apprehension of what is. Synthetic cognition aims at the comprehension of what is, that is, atgrasping the multiplicity of determinations in their unity. It is therefore the second premise of the syllogismin which the diverse as such is related. Hence its aim is in general necessity. The different terms which areconnected, are on the one hand connected in a relation; in this relation they are related and at the same timemutually indifferent and self−subsistent, but on the other hand, they are linked together in the Notion whichis their simple yet determinate unity. Now synthetic cognition passes over, in the first instance, from abstractidentity to relation, or from being to reflection, and so far it is not the absolute reflection of the Notion thatthe Notion cognises in its subject matter. The reality it gives itself is the next stage, namely, the statedidentity of the different terms as such, an identity therefore that is at the same time still inner and onlynecessity, not the subjective identity that is for itself; hence not yet the Notion as such. Synthetic cognition,therefore, has indeed the Notion determinations for its content, and the object is posited in them; but theyonly stand in relation to one another, or are in immediate unity, and just for that reason, not in the unity bywhich the Notion exists as subject. § 1721 This constitutes the finitude of this cognition; because this real side of the Idea in it still possesses identity asan inner identity, its determinations are to themselves still external; because the identity is not in the form ofsubjectivity, the Notion's own pervasion of the object still lacks individuality; what corresponds to the Notionin the object is indeed no longer the abstract but the determinate form and therefore the particularity of theNotion, but the individual element in the object is still a given content. Consequently, although this cognitiontransforms the objective world into Notions, it gives it Notion−determinations only in respect of form, andmust find the object in respect of its individuality, its specific determinateness; such cognition is not yetself−determining. Similarly, it finds propositions and laws, and proves their necessity, but not as a necessityof the subject matter in and for itself, that is, not from the Notion, but as a necessity of the cognition that Science of LogicAnalytical Science148"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"works on given determinations, on the differences of the phenomenal aspect of the subject matter, andcognises for itself the proposition as a unity and relationship, or cognises the ground of phenomena from thephenomena themselves. We have now to consider the detailed moments of synthetic cognition. 1. Definition § 1722 First, the still given objectivity is transformed into the simple and first form, hence into the form of theNotion. Accordingly the moments of this apprehension are none other than the moments of the Notion,universality, particularity and individuality. The individual is the object itself as an immediate representation,that which is to be defined. The universality of the object of definition we have found in the determination ofthe objective judgement or judgement of necessity to be the genus, and indeed the proximate genus; that is tosay, the universal with this determinateness that is at the same time a principle for the differentiation of theparticular. This difference the object possesses in the specific difference, which makes it the determinatespecies it is and is the basis of its disjunction from the remaining species. § 1723 Definition, in thus reducing the subject matter to its Notion, strips it of its externalities which are requisite forits concrete existence; it abstracts from what accrues to the Notion in its realisation, whereby it emerges firstinto Idea, and secondly into external existence. Description is for representation, and takes in this furthercontent that belongs to reality. But definition reduces this wealth of the manifold determinations of intuitedexistence to the simplest moments; the form of these simple elements, and how they are determined relativelyto one another, is contained in the Notion. The subject matter is thus, as we have stated, grasped as auniversal that is at the same time essentially determinate. The subject matter itself is the third factor, theindividual, in which the genus and the particularisation are posited in one; it is an immediate that is positedoutside the Notion, since the latter is not yet self−determining. § 1724 In the said moments, which are the form−difference of definition, the Notion finds itself and has in them thereality correspondent to it. But the reflection of the Notion−moments into themselves, which is individuality,is not yet contained in this reality, and therefore the object, in so far as it is in cognition, is not yet determinedas subjective. Whereas, cognition on the contrary is subjective and has an external starting point, or it issubjective by reason of its external starting point in the individual. The content of the Notion is therefore adatum and contingent. Consequently, the concrete Notion itself is contingent in a twofold aspect: first it iscontingent in respect of its content as such; secondly it is contingent which determinations of the contentfrom among the manifold qualities that the object possesses in external existence are to be selected for theNotion and are to constitute its moments. § 1725 The latter point requires closer consideration. For since individuality, which is determined in and for itself,lies outside the Notion−determination peculiar to synthetic cognition there is no principle available fordetermining which sides of the subject matter are to be regarded as belonging to its Notion−determinationand which merely to the external reality. This constitutes a difficulty in the case of definitions, a difficultythat for synthetic cognition cannot be overcome. Yet here a distinction must be made. In the first place, thedefinition of products of self−conscious purposiveness is easily discovered; for the end that they are to serve Science of LogicAnalytical Science149"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"is a determination created out of the subjective resolve and constituting the essential particularisation, theform of the concrete existent thing, which is here the sole concern. Apart from this, the nature of its materialand its other external properties, in so far as they correspond to the end, are contained in its determination; therest are unessential for it. § 1726 Secondly, geometrical objects are abstract determinations of space; the underlying abstraction, so−calledabsolute space, has lost all further concrete determinations and now too possesses only such shapes andconfigurations as are posited in it. These objects therefore are only what they are meant to be; their Notiondetermination in general, and more precisely the specific difference, possesses in them its simple unhinderedreality. To this extent, they resemble the products of external purposiveness, and they also agree with thesubject matter of arithmetic in which likewise the underlying determination is only that which has beenposited in it. True, space has still further determinations: its three−dimensionality, its continuity anddivisibility, which are not first posited in it by external determination. But these belong to the acceptedmaterial and are immediate presuppositions; it is only the combination and entanglement of the formersubjective determinations with this peculiar nature of the domain into which they have been imported thatproduces synthetic relationships and laws. In the case of numerical determinations, since they are based onthe simple principle of the One, their combination and any further determination is simply and solely apositedness; on the other hand, determinations in space, which is explicitly a continuous mutual externality,run a further course of their own and possess a reality distinct from their Notion; but this no longer belongs tothe immediate definition. § 1727 But, thirdly, in the case of definitions of concrete objects of Nature as well as of spirit, the position is quitedifferent. In general such objects are, for representation, things of many properties. Here, what we have to doin the first instance is to apprehend what is their proximate genus, and then, what is their specific difference.We have therefore to determine which of the many properties belong to the object as genus, and which asspecies, and further which among these properties is the essential one; this last point involves the necessity ofascertaining their interrelationship, whether one is already posited with the other. But for this purpose there isso far no other criterion to hand than existence itself. The essentiality of the property for the purpose of thedefinition, in which it is to be posited as a simple, undeveloped determinateness, is its universality. But inexistence universality is merely empirical. It may be universality in time−whether the property in question islasting, while the others show themselves transitory in the subsistence of the whole; or it may be auniversality resulting from comparison with other concrete wholes and in that case it goes no further thancommunity. Now if comparison indicates as the common basis the total habitue as empirically presented,reflection has to bring this together into a simple thought determination and to grasp the simple character ofsuch a totality. But the only possible attestation that a thought determination, or a single one of the immediateproperties, constitutes the simple and specific essence of the object, is the derivation of such a determinationfrom the concrete properties of the subject matter. But this would demand an analysis transforming theimmediate properties into thoughts and reducing what is concrete to something simple. Such an analysis,however, would be higher than the one already considered; for it could not be abstractive, but would have topreserve in the universal what is specific in the concrete, unify it and show it to be dependent on the simplethought determination. § 1728 The relations of the manifold determinations of immediate existence to the simple Notion would however betheorems requiring proof. But definition is the first, still undeveloped Notion; therefore, when it has toapprehend the simple determinateness of the subject matter, which apprehension has to be something Science of LogicAnalytical Science150"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"immediate, it can only employ for the purpose one of its immediate so−called properties−a determination ofsensuous existence or representation. The isolation, then, of this property by abstraction, constitutessimplicity, and for universality and essentiality the Notion has to fall back onto empirical universality, thepersistence in altered circumstances, and the reflection that seeks the Notion−determination in externalexistence and in picture thinking, that is, seeks it where it is not to be found. Definition, therefore,automatically renounces the Notion−determinations proper, which would be essentially principles of thesubject matter, and contents itself with marks, that is, determinations in which essentiality for the object itselfis a matter of indifference, and which are intended merely to be distinguishing marks for an externalreflection. A single, external determinateness of this kind is too inadequate to the concrete totality and to thenature of its Notion, to justify its selection for its own sake, nor could it be taken for the true expression anddetermination of a concrete whole. According to Blumenbach's observation, for example, the lobe of the earis absent in all other animals, and therefore in the usual phraseology of common and distinguishing marks itcould quite properly be used as the distinctive characteristic in the definition of physical man. But howinadequate such a completely external determination at once appears when compared with the conception ofthe total habitue of physical man, and with the demand that the Notion determination shall be somethingessential! It is quite contingent whether the, marks adopted in the definition are pure makeshifts like this, oron the other hand approximate more to the nature of a principle. It is also to be observed that, on account oftheir externality, they have not been the starting point in the cognition of the Notion of the object; on thecontrary, an obscure feeling, an indefinite but deeper sense, an inkling of what is essential, has preceded thediscovery of the genera in nature and in spirit, and only afterwards has a specific externality been sought tosatisfy the understanding. In existence the Notion has entered into externality and is accordingly explicatedinto its differences and cannot be attached simply to a single one of such properties. The properties, as theexternality of the thing, are external to themselves; that is why, as we pointed out in the sphere of Appearancewhen dealing with the thing of many properties, properties essentially become even self−subsistent matters;spirit, regarded from the same standpoint of Appearance, becomes an aggregate of a number ofself−subsistent forces. Through this standpoint, the single property or force, even where it is posited asindifferent to the others, ceases to be a characterising principle, with the result that the determinateness, asdeterminateness of the Notion, vanishes altogether. § 1729 Into concrete things, along with the diversity of the properties among themselves, there enters also thedifference between the Notion and its actualisation. The Notion in nature and in spirit has an externalpresentation in which its determinateness shows itself as dependence on the external, as transitoriness andinadequacy. Therefore, although any actual thing no doubt shows in itself what it ought to be, yet inaccordance with the negative judgement of the Notion it may equally show that its actuality only imperfectlycorresponds to this Notion, that it is bad. Now the definition is supposed to indicate the determinateness ofthe Notion in an immediate property; yet there is no property against which an instance cannot be brought inwhich the total habitus, though it enables one to discern the concrete thing to be defined, yet the propertytaken as its characteristic shows itself immature or stunted. In a bad plant, a poor specimen of an animal, acontemptible human being, a bad state, aspects of its concrete existence are defective or entirely obliteratedthat otherwise might have been adopted for the definition as the distinguishing mark and essentialdeterminateness in the existence of such a concrete. But for all that, a bad plant or a bad animal, etc., stillremains a plant or an animal. If, therefore, bad specimens too are to be covered by the definition, then all theproperties that we wanted to regard as essential elude us through instances of malformations in which tho seproperties a re lacking. Thus for example the essentiality of the brain for physical man is contradicted by theinstance of acephalous individuals, the essentiality of the protection of life and property for the state, by theinstance of despotic states and tyrannous governments. If the Notion is asserted against such an instance andthe instance, being measured by the Notion, is declared to be a bad specimen, then the Notion is no longerattested by phenomena. But the self−subsistence of the Notion is contrary to the meaning of definition; fordefinition is supposed to be the immediate Notion, and therefore can only draw on the immediacy of Science of LogicAnalytical Science151"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"existence for its determinations for objects, and can justify itself only in what it finds already to hand.Whether its content is in−and−for itself truth or a contingency, this lies outside its sphere; but formal truth,the agreement between the Notion subjectively posited in the definition and an actual object outside it, cannotbe established because the individual object may also be a bad specimen. § 1730 The content of definition is in general taken from immediate existence, and being an immediate content hasno justification; the question of its necessity is precluded by its origin; in enunciating the Notion as a mereimmediate, the definition refrains from comprehending the Notion itself. Hence it represents nothing but theform determination of the Notion in a given content, without the reflection of the Notion into itself, that is,without the Notion's being−for−self. § 1731 But immediacy in general proceeds only from mediation, and must therefore pass over into mediation. Or, inother words, the determinateness of the content contained in the definition, because it is determinateness, isnot merely an immediate, but is mediated by its opposite; consequently definition can apprehend its subjectmatter only through the opposite determination and must therefore pass over into division. 2. Division3. The TheoremAxioms§ 1763 In synthetic cognition, therefore, the Idea attains its end only to the extent that the Notion becomes for theNotion according to its moments of identity and real determinations, or of universality and particulardifferences −− further also as an identity that is the connection and dependence of the diverse elements. Butthis subject matter of the Notion is not adequate to it; for the Notion does not come to be the unity of itselfwith itself in its subject matter or its reality; in necessity its identity is for it; but in this identity the necessityis not itself the determinateness, but appears as a matter external to the identity, that is, as a matter notdetermined by the Notion, a matter, therefore, in which the Notion does not cognise itself. Thus in general theNotion is not for itself, is not at the same time determined in and for itself according to its unity. Hence in thiscognition the Idea which falls short of truth on account of the inadequacy of the subject matter to thesubjective Notion. But the sphere of necessity is the apex of being and reflection; through its own essentialnature it passes into its manifestation, which is the Notion as Notion. How this transition from the sphere ofnecessity into the Notion is effected in principle has been shown in treating of necessity; the same transitionalso presented itself as the genesis of the Notion at the beginning of this Book. § 1764 Here necessity has the position of being the reality or subject matter of the Notion, just as the Notion intowhich it passes now appears as the Notion's subject matter. But the transition itself is the same. Here too it isonly at first implicit and lies as yet outside cognition in our reflection; that is, it is still the inner necessity ofthe cognition itself. It is only the result that is for it. The Idea, in so far as the Notion is now explicitly determined in and for itself, is the practical Idea, or action. The Idea of the Good − Next Section Science of LogicAnalytical Science152"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The Doctrine of the Notion The Idea of the Good§ 1765 The Notion, which is its own subject matter, being determined in and for itself, the subject is determined foritself as an individual. As subjective it again presupposes an implicit otherness; it is the urge to realise itself,the end that wills by means of itself to give itself objectivity and to realise itself in the objective world. In the theoretical Idea the subjective Notion, as the universal that lacks any determination of its own, standsopposed to the objective world from which it takes to itself a determinate content and filling. But in thepractical Idea it is as actual that it confronts the actual; but the certainty of itself which the subject possessesin being determinate in and for itself is a certainty of its own actuality and the non−actuality of the world; it isnot only the world's otherness as an abstract universality that is a nullity for the subject, but the world'sindividuality and the determination of its individuality. The subject has here vindicated objectivity for itself;its immanent determinateness is the objective, for it is the universality that is just as much absolutelydetermined; the formerly objective world, on the contrary, is now only something posited, somethingimmediately determined in various ways, but because it is only immediately determined, the unity of theNotion is lacking in it and it is, by itself, a nullity. § 1766 This determinateness contained in the Notion and in the likeness of the Notion, and including within it thedemand for an individual external actuality, is the good. It comes upon the scene with the worth of beingabsolute, because it is within itself the totality of the Notion, the objective that is at the same time in the formof free unity and subjectivity. This Idea is superior to the Idea of cognition already considered, for it possesses not only the worth of theuniversal but also of the out−and−out actual. It is an urge in so far as this actuality is still subjective, positingits own self and not having at the same time the form of immediate presupposition; its urge to realise itself is,strictly speaking, not to give itself objectivity this it possesses within itself but merely this empty form ofimmediacy. Hence the activity of the end is not directed against itself in order to adopt and appropriate agiven determination and by sublating the determinateness of the external world to give itself reality in theform of external actuality. The Idea of the will as explicitly self−determining possesses the content withinitself. Now it is true that this is a determinate content and to that extent something finite and limited;self−determination is essentially particularisation, since the reflection of the will into itself as a negative unityin general is also individuality in the sense of the exclusion and presupposition of an other. Nevertheless, theparticularity of the content is in the first instance infinite through the form of the Notion, whose owndeterminateness it is; and in this content the Notion possesses its negative self−identity, and therefore notmerely a particular, but its own infinite individuality. Consequently, the above−mentioned finitude of thecontent in the practical Idea is tantamount to the latter being in the first instance the not yet realised Idea; theNotion is, for the content, something that is in and for itself; it is here the Idea in the form of objectivity thatis for itself; on the one hand, the subjective is for this reason no longer something merely posited, arbitrary orcontingent, but an absolute; but on the other hand, this form of concrete existence, being−for−self, has not yetthe form of the in−itself as well. What thus appears in respect of form as such, as opposition, appears in theform of the Notion reflected into simple identity, that is, appears in the content as its simple determinateness;thus the good, although valid in and for itself, is some particular end, but an end that has not to wait toreceive its truth through its realisation, but is already on its own account the true. § 1767 Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion The Idea of the Good153"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The syllogism of immediate realisation itself requires no detailed exposition here; it is altogether the same asthe syllogism of external purposiveness considered above; it is only the content that constitutes thedifference. In external as in formal purposiveness, it was an indeterminate finite content in general; here,though it is finite too, it is as such at the same time as absolutely valid content. But in regard to theconclusion, to the realised end, a further difference comes in. The finite end in its realisation, all the same,gets no further than a means; since in its beginning it is not an end already determined in and for itself, itremains even when realised an end that is not in and for itself. If the good again is also fixed as somethingfinite, if it is essentially such, then notwithstanding its inner infinitude it cannot escape the destiny of finitudea destiny that manifests itself in a number of forms. The realised good is good by virtue of what it already isin the subjective end, in its Idea; realisation gives it an external existence; but since his existence isdetermined merely as an intrinsically worthless externality, in it the good has only attained a contingent,destructible existence, not a realisation corresponding to its Idea. Further, since in respect of its content thegood is restricted, there are several kinds of good; good in its concrete existence is not only subject todestruction by external contingency and by evil, but by the collision and conflict of the good itself. From theside of the objective world presupposed for it, in the presupposition of which the subjectivity and finitude ofthe good consists, and which as a different world goes its own way, the very realisation of the good isexposed to obstacles, obstacles which may indeed even be insurmountable. § 1768 In this way, the good remains an ought−to−be; it is in and for itself, but being, as the ultimate abstractimmediacy, remains also confronting is in the form of a not−being. § 1769 The Idea of the realised good is, it is true, an absolute postulate, but it is no more than a postulate, that is, theabsolute afflicted with the determinateness of subjectivity. There are still two worlds in opposition, one arealm of subjectivity in the pure regions of transparent thought, the other a realm of objectivity in the elementof an externally manifold actuality that is an undisclosed realm of darkness. The complete elaboration of theunresolved contradiction between that absolute end and the limitation of this actuality that insuperablyopposes it, has been considered in detail in the Phenomenology of Spirit. § 1770 As the Idea contains within itself the moment of complete determinateness, the other Notion with which theNotion enters into relation in the Idea, possesses in its subjectivity also the moment of an object;consequently the Idea enter here into the shape of self−consciousness and in this one aspect coincides withthe exposition of the same. § 1771 But what is still lacking in the practical Idea is the moment of consciousness proper itself; namely, that themoment of actuality in the Notion should have attained on its own account the determination of externalbeing. § 1772 Another way of regarding this defect is that the practical Idea still lacks the moment of the theoretical Idea.That is to say, in the latter there stands on the side of the subjective Notion −− the Notion that is in process ofbeing intuited within itself by the Notion only the determination of universality; cognition knows itself onlyas apprehension, as the identity on its own account indeterminate of the Notion with itself; the filling, that is, Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion The Idea of the Good154"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"the objectivity that is determined in and for itself, is for it a datum, and what truly is is the actuality therebefore it independently of subjective positing. For the practical Idea, on the contrary, this actuality, which atthe same time confronts it as an insuperable limitation, ranks as something intrinsically worthless that mustfirst receive its true determination and sole worth through the ends of the good. Hence it is only the will itselfthat stands in the way of attainment of its goal, for it separates itself from cognition, and external reality forthe will does not receive the form of a true being; the Idea of the good can therefore find its integration onlyin the Idea of the true. § 1773 But it makes this transition through itself. In the syllogism of action, one premise is the immediate relation ofthe good end to actuality which it seizes on, and in the second premise directs it as an external means againstthe external actuality. § 1774 For the subjective Notion the good is the objective; actuality in its existence confronts is as an insuperablelimitation only in so far as it still has the character of immediate existence, not of something objective in thesense of a being that is in and for itself; on the contrary, it is either the evil or the indifferent, the merelydeterminable, whose worth does not reside within it. This abstract being that confronts the good in the secondpremise has, however, already been sublated by the practical Idea itself; the first premise of the latter's actionis the immediate objectivity of the Notion, according to which the end communicates itself to actualitywithout meeting any resistance and is in simple identical relation with it. Thus all that remains to be done isto bring together the thoughts of its two premises. To what has been already immediately accomplished bythe objective Notion in the first premise, the only addition made in the second premise is that it is positedthrough mediation, and hence posited for the objective Notion. Now just as in the end relation in general, therealised end is also again merely a means, while conversely the means is also the realised end, so similarly inthe syllogism of the good, the second premise is immediately already present implicitly in the first; but thisimmediacy is not sufficient, and the second premise is already postulated for the first −− the realisation of thegood in the face of another actuality confronting it is the mediation which is essentially necessary for theimmediate relation and the accomplished actualisation of the good. § 1775 For it is only the first negation or the otherness of the Notion, an objectivity that would be a submergence ofthe Notion in the externality; the second negation is the sublating of this otherness, whereby the immediaterealisation of the end first becomes the actuality the Notion is posited as identical with itself, not with another, and thus alone is posited as the free Notion. § 1776 Now if it is supposed that the end of the good is after all not realised through this mediation, this signifies arelapse of the Notion to the standpoint occupied by it before its activity −− the standpoint of an actualitydetermined as worthless and yet presupposed as real. This relapse, which becomes the progress to thespurious infinity, has its sole ground in the fact that in the sublating of that abstract reality this sublating is noless immediately forgotten, or it is forgotten that this reality is in fact already presupposed as an actuality thatis intrinsically worthless and not objective. § 1777 Science of LogicThe Doctrine of the Notion The Idea of the Good155"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"This repetition of the presupposition of the end consequently assumes this character, that the subjectivebearing of the objective Notion is reproduced and made perpetual, with the result that the finitude of the goodin respect of its content as well as its form appears as the abiding truth, and its actualisation appears as amerely individual act, and not as a universal one. As a matter of fact this determinateness has sublated itselfin the actualisation of the good; what still limits the objective Notion is its own view of itself, which vanishesby reflection on what its actualisation is in itself. Through this view it is only standing in its own way, andthus what it has to do is to turn, not against an outer actuality, but against itself. § 1778 In other words, the activity in the second premise produces only a one−sided being−for−self, and its producttherefore appears as something subjective and individual, and consequently the first presupposition isrepeated in it. But this activity is in truth no less the positing of the implicit identity of the objective Notionand the immediate actuality. This latter is determined by the presupposition as having a phenomenal realityonly, as being intrinsically worthless and simply and solely determinable by the objective Notion. Whenexternal actuality is altered by the activity of the objective Notion and its determination therewith sublated,by that very fact the merely phenomenal reality, the external determinability and worthlessness, are removedfrom that actuality and it is posited as being in and for itself. § 1779 In this process the general presupposition is sublated, namely the determination of the good as a merelysubjective end limited in respect of content, the necessity of realising it by subjective activity, and thisactivity itself. In the result the mediation sublates itself; the result is an immediacy that is not the restorationof the presupposition, but rather its accomplished sublation. With this, the Idea of the Notion that isdetermined in and for itself is posited as being no longer merely in the active subject but as equally animmediate actuality; and conversely, this actuality is posited, as it is in cognition, as an objectivity possessinga true being. § 1780 The individuality of the subject with which the subject was burdened by its presupposition, has vanishedalong with the presupposition; hence the subject now exists as free, universal self−identity, for which theobjectivity of the Notion is a given objectivity immediately to hand, no less truly than the subject knows itselfas the Notion that is determined in and for itself. Accordingly in this result cognition is restored and unitedwith the practical Idea; the actuality found as given is at the same time determined as the realised absoluteend; but whereas in questing cognition this subjectivity appeared merely as an objective world without thesubjectivity of the Notion, here it appears as an objective world whose inner ground and actual subsistence isthe Notion. This is the absolute Idea. The Absolute Idea§ 1781 The absolute Idea has turned out to be the identity of the theoretical and the practical Idea. Each of these byitself is still one−sided, possessing the Idea only as a sought for beyond and an unattained goal; each,therefore, is a synthesis of endeavour, and has, but equally has not, the Idea in it; each passes from onethought to the other without bringing the two together, and so remains fixed in their contradiction. Theabsolute Idea, as the rational Notion that in its reality meets only with itself, is by virtue of this immediacy ofits objective identity, on the one hand the return to life; but it has no less sublated this form of its immediacy, Science of LogicThe Absolute Idea156"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"and contains within itself the highest degree of opposition. The Notion is not merely soul but free subjectiveNotion that is for itself and therefore possesses personality −− the practical, objective Notion determined inand for itself which, as person, is impenetrable atomic individuality, but explicitly universality and cognition,and in its other has its own objectivity for its object. All else is error, confusion, opinion, endeavour, capriceand transitoriness; the absolute Idea alone is being, imperishable life, self−knowing truth, and is all truth. § 1782 It is the sole subject matter and content of philosophy. Since it contains all determinations within it, and itsessential nature is to return to itself through its self−determination or particularisation, it has various shapes,and the business of philosophy is to cognise it in these. Nature and spirit are in general different modes ofpresenting its existence, art and religion its different modes of apprehending itself and giving itself anadequate existence. Philosophy has the same content and the same end as art and religion; but it is the highestmode of apprehending the absolute idea, because its mode is the highest mode, the Notion. Hence it embraces those shapes of real and ideal finitude as well as of infinitude and cognition of theseparticular modes is now the further business of the particular philosophical sciences. § 1783 The logical aspect of the absolute Idea may also be called a mode of it; but whereas mode signifies aparticular kind, a determinateness of form, the logical aspect, on the contrary, is the universal mode in whichall particular modes are sublated and enfolded. The logical Idea os the Idea itself in its pure essence, the Ideaenclosed in simple identity within its Notion prior to its immediate reflection in a form−determinateness. Hence logic exhibits the self−movement of the absolute Idea only as original word, which is an outwardisingor utterance, but an utterance that in being has immediately vanished again as something outer; the Idea is,therefore, only in this self−determination of apprehending itself; it is in pure thought, in which difference isnot yet otherness, but is and remains perfectly transparent to itself. Thus the logical Idea has itself as theinfinite form for its content −− form which constitutes the opposite to content to this extent that the content isthe form−determination withdrawn into itself and sublated in the identity in such a manner that this concreteidentity stands opposed to the identity explicated as form; the content has the shape of an other and a datumas against the form which as such stands simply in relation, and its determinateness is at the same timeposited as an illusory being. More exactly, the determination is its own completed totality, the pure Notion.Now the determinateness of the Idea and the entire course followed by this determinateness has constitutedthe subject matter of the science of logic, from which course the absolute Idea itself has issued into anexistence of its own; but the nature of this existence has shown itself to be this, that determinateness does nothave the shape of content, but exists wholly as form, and that accordingly the Idea is the absolutely universalIdea. Therefore what remains to be considered here is not a content as such, but the universal aspect of itsform −− that is, the method. § 1784 Method may appear at first as the mere manner peculiar to the process of cognition, and as a matter of fact ithas the nature of such. But the peculiar manner, as method, is not merely a modality of being determined inand for itself; it is a modality of cognition, and as such is posited as determined by the Notion and as form, inso far as the form is the soul of all objectivity and all otherwise determined content has its truth in the formalone. If the content again is assumed as given to the method and of a peculiar nature of its own, then in such adetermination method, as with the logical element in general, is a merely external form. Against this however Science of LogicThe Absolute Idea157"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"we can appeal not only to the fundamental Notion of the science of logic; its entire course, in which allpossible shapes of a given content and of objects came up for consideration, has demonstrated their transitionand untruth; also that not merely was it impossible for a given object to be the foundation to which theabsolute form stood in a merely external and contingent relationship but that, on the contrary, the absoluteform has proved itself to be the absolute foundation and ultimate truth. From this course the method hasemerged as the self−knowing Notion that has itself, as the absolute, both subjective and objective, for itssubject matter, consequently as the pure correspondence of the Notion and its reality, as a concrete that is theNotion itself. § 1785 Accordingly, what is to be considered here as method is only the movement of the Notion itself, the nature ofwhich movement has already been cognised; but first, there is now the added significance that the Notion iseverything, and its movement is the universal absolute activity, the self−determining and self−realisingmovement. The method is therefore to be recognised as the unrestrictedly universal, internal and externalmode; and as the absolutely infinite force, to which no object, presenting itself as something external, remotefrom and independent of reason, could offer resistance or be of a particular nature in opposition to it, or couldnot be penetrated by it. It is therefore soul and substance, and anything whatever is comprehended and knownin its truth only when it is completely subjugated to the method; it is the method proper to every subjectmatter because its activity is the Notion. This is also the truer meaning if its universality; according to theuniversality of reflection it is regarded merely as the method for everything; but according to the universalityof the Idea, it is both the manner peculiar to cognition, to the subjectively selfknowing Notion, and also theobjective manner, or rather the substantiality, of things −− that is of Notions, in so far as they appearprimarily to representation and reflection as others. It is therefore not only the highest force, or rather the soleand absolute force of reason, but also its supreme and sole urge to find and cognise itself by means of itself ineverything. Here, secondly, is indicated the difference of the method from the Notion as such, the particularaspect of the method. The Notion, when it was considered by itself, appeared in its immediacy; the reflection,or the Notion that considered it, fell within our knowing. The method is this knowing itself, for which the Notion is not merely the subject matter, but knowing's ownsubjective act, the instrument and means of the cognising activity, distinguished from that activity, but onlyas the activity's own essentiality. In the cognition of enquiry, the method likewise occupies the position of aninstrument, of a means standing on the subjective side by which this side relates itself to the object. In thissyllogism the subject is one extreme and the object the other, and the former by means of its method uniteswith the latter, but in doing so it does not unite with itself. The extremes remain diverse because subject,method, and object are not posited as the one identical Notion; the syllogism is therefore still the formalsyllogism; the premises in which the subject posits the form on its side as its method is an immediatedetermination, and therefore contains the determinations of form, as we have seen, of definition, division, andso forth, as facts found existing in the subject. In true cognition on the contrary, the method is not merely anaggregate of certain determinations, but the Notion that is determined in and for itself; and the Notion is themiddle term only because it has equally the significance of the objective, and consequently in the conclusionthe objective does not merely attain an external determinateness by means of the method, but is posited in itsidentity with the subjective Notion. § 1786 1. Thus what constitute the method are the determinations of the Notion itself and their relations, which wehave now to consider in their significance as determinations of the method. In doing so we must first beginwith the beginning. Of the beginning we have already spoken at the beginning of the Logic itself, and alsoabove, when dealing with subjective cognition, and we have shown that, if it is not made arbitrarily and witha categorical unconsciousness, it may indeed seem to involve a number of difficulties but nevertheless is of Science of LogicThe Absolute Idea158"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"an extremely simple nature. Because it is the beginning, its content is an immediate, but an immediate thathas the significance and form of abstract universality. Be it otherwise a content of being, or of essence, or ofthe Notion, it is as an immediate something assumed, found already in existence, assertorical. But first of allit is not an immediate of sensuous intuition or of representation, but of thinking, which on account of itsimmediacy may also be called a supersensuous inner intuition. The immediate of sensuous intuition is a manifold and an individual. But cognition is thinking by means ofnotions, and therefore its beginning also is only in the element of thought −− it is a simple and a universal.This form has already been discussed under definition. At the beginning of finite cognition universality islikewise recognised as an essential determination, but it is taken as a determination of thought and of Notiononly in opposition to being. In point of fact this first universality is an immediate one, and for that reason hasequally the significance of being; for being is precisely this abstract relation−to−self. Being requires nofurther derivation, as though it belonged to the abstract product of definition only because it is taken fromsensuous intuition or elsewhere, and in so far as it is pointed out to us. This pointing out and derivation is amatter of mediation, which is more than a mere beginning, and is a mediation of a kind that does not belongto a comprehension by means of thinking, but is the elevation of ordinary thinking, of the empirical andratiocinative consciousness, to the standpoint of thought. According to the current opposition of thought orconcept and being it is regarded as an important truth that no being belongs as yet to the former, taken on itsown, and that the latter has a ground of its own that is independent of thought. But the simple determinationof being is in itself so meagre that, if only for that reason, there is no need to make much fuss about it; theuniversal is immediately itself this immediate, since as abstract it also is merely the abstract relation−to−self,which is being. As a matter of fact, the demand that being should be exhibited for us to see has a further,inner meaning involving more than this abstract determination; what is meant by it is in general the demandfor the realisation of the Notion, which realisation does not lie in the beginning itself, but is rather the goaland the task of the entire further development of cognition. Further, since the content of the beginning issupposed to be justified and authenticated as something true or correct by its being pointed out in inner orouter perception, it is no longer the form of universality as such that is meant, but its determinateness, ofwhich we shall need to speak presently. The authentication of the determinate content with which thebeginning is made seems to lie behind it; but in fact it is to be considered as an advance, that is, if it belongsto philosophical cognition. § 1787 Hence the beginning has for the method no other determinateness than that of being simple and universal; thisis itself the determinateness by reason of which it is deficient. Universality is the pure simple Notion, and themethod, as consciousness of the Notion, knows that universality is only a moment and that in it the Notion isnot yet determined in and for itself. But with this consciousness that would carry the beginning further onlyfor the sake of the method, the method would be a formal affair, something posited in external reflection.Since however it is the objective immanent form, the immediate of the beginning must be in its own selfdeficient and endowed with the urge to carry itself further. But in the absolute method the universal has thevalue not of a mere abstraction but of the objective universal, that is, the universal that is in itself the concretetotality, though that totality is not yet posited, is not yet for itself. Even the abstract universal as such,considered in its Notion, that is in its truth, is not merely the simple, but as abstract is already posited asinfected with a negation. For this reason too there is nothing, whether in actuality or in thought, that is assimple and as abstract as is commonly imagined. A simple thing of this kind is a mere presumption that hasits ground solely in the unconsciousness of what is actually present. Above, that with which the beginning ismade was determined as the immediate; the immediacy of the universal is the same thing that is hereexpressed as the in−itself that is without a being−for−self. Hence it may indeed be said that every beginningmust be made with the absolute, just as all advance is merely the exposition of it, in so far as its in−itself isthe Notion. But because the absolute is at first only in itself it equally is not the absolute nor the positedNotion, and also not the Idea; for what characterises these is precisely the fact that in them the in−itself is Science of LogicThe Absolute Idea159"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"only an abstract, one−sided moment. Hence the advance is not a kind of superfluity; this it would be if thatwith which the beginning is made were in truth already the absolute; the advance consists rather in theuniversal determining itself and being for itself the universal, that is, equally an individual and a subject.Only in its consummation is it the absolute. § 1788 It is to be recalled that the beginning, which is in itself a concrete totality, may as beginning also be free andits immediacy have the determination of an external existence; the germ of the living being and the subjectiveend in general have proved themselves to be such beginnings and therefore both are themselves urges. The non−spiritual and inanimate, on the contrary, are the Notion only as real possibility; cause is the higheststage in which the concrete Notion, as a beginning in the sphere of necessity has an immediate existence; butit is not yet a subject that maintains itself as such even in its actual realisation. The sun, for example, and ingeneral all inanimate things, are determinate concrete existences in which real possibility remains an innertotality and the moments of the totality are not posited in subjective form in them and, in so far as they realisethemselves, attain an existence by means of other corporeal individuals. § 1789 2. The concrete totality which makes the beginning contains as such within itself the beginning of theadvance and development. As concrete, it is differentiated within itself: but by reason of its first immediacythe first differentiated determinations are in the first instance merely a diversity. The immediate, however, as self−related universality, as subject, is also the unity of these diversedeterminations. This reflection is the first stage of the movement onwards −− the emergence of realdifference, judgement, the process of determining in general. The essential point is that the absolute methodfinds and cognises the determination of the universal within the latter itself. The procedure of the finitecognition of the understanding here is to take up again, equally externally, what it has left out in its creationof the universal by a process of abstraction. The absolute method, on the contrary, does not behave like external reflection but takes the determinateelement from its own subject matter, since it is itself that subject matter's immanent principle and soul. This iswhat Plato demanded of cognition, that it should consider things in and for themselves, that is, shouldconsider them partly in their universality, but also that it should not stray away from them catching atcircumstances, examples and comparisons, but should keep before it solely the things themselves and bringbefore consciousness what is immanent in them. § 1790 The method of absolute cognition is to this extent analytic. That it finds the further determination of its initialuniversal simply and solely in that universal, is the absolute objectivity of the Notion, of which objectivitythe method is the certainty. But the method is no less synthetic, since its subject matter, determinedimmediately as a simple universal, by virtue of the determinateness which it possesses in its very immediacyand universality, exhibits itself as an other. This relation of differential elements which the subject matterthus is within itself, is however no longer the same thing as is meant by synthesis in finite cognition; the merefact of the subject matter's no less analytic determination in general, that the relation is relation within theNotion, completely distinguishes it from the latter synthesis. § 1791 Science of LogicThe Absolute Idea160"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"This no less synthetic than analytic moment of judgement, by which the universal of the beginning of its ownaccord determines itself as the other of itself, is to be named the dialectical moment. Dialectic is one of those ancient sciences that have been most misunderstood in the metaphysics of themoderns, as well as by popular philosophy in general, ancient and modern alike. Diogenes Laertius says ofPlato that, just as Thales was the founder of natural philosophy and Socrates of moral philosophy, so Platowas the founder of the third science pertaining to philosophy, namely, dialectic −− a service which theancient world esteemed his highest, but which often remains quite overlooked by those who have most to sayabout him. Dialectic has often been regarded as an art, as though it rested on a subjective talent and did notbelong to the objectivity of the Notion. The shape it takes and the result it reaches in Kantian philosophy havealready been pointed out in the specific examples of the Kantian view of it. It must be regarded as a step ofinfinite importance that dialectic is once more recognised as necessary to reason, although the result to bedrawn from it must be the opposite of that arrived at by Kant. § 1792 Besides the fact that dialectic is generally regarded as contingent, it usually takes the following more preciseform. It is shown that there belongs to some subject matter or other, for example the world, motion, point,and so on, some determination or other, for example (taking the objects in the order named), finite in space ortime, presence in this place, absolute negation of space; but further, that with equal necessity the oppositedetermination also belongs to the subject matter, for example, infinity in space and time, non−presence in thisplace, relation to space and so spatiality. The older Eleatic school directed its dialectic chiefly against motion.Plato frequently against the general ideas and notions of his time, especially those of the Sophists, but alsoagainst the pure categories and the determinations of reflection; the more cultivated scepticism of a laterperiod extended it not only to the immediate so−called facts of consciousness and maxims of common life,but also to all the notions of science. § 1793 Now the conclusion drawn from dialectic of this kind is in general the contradiction and nullity of theassertion made. But this conclusion can be drawn in either of two senses either in the objective sense, that thesubject matter which in such a manner contradicts itself cancels itself out and is null and void −− this was, forexample, the conclusion of the Eleatics, according to which truth was denied, for example, to the world, tomotion, to the point; or in the subjective sense, that cognition is defective. One way of understanding the latter sense of the conclusion is that it is only this dialectic that imposes on usthe trick of an illusion. This is the common view of so−called sound common sense which takes its stand onthe evidence of the senses and on customary conceptions and judgements. Sometimes it takes this dialecticlightly, as when Diogenes the cynic exposes the hollowness of the dialectic of motion by silently walking upand down;; but often it flies into a passion, seeing it in perhaps a piece of sheer foolery, or, when morallyimportant objects are concerned, an outrage that tries to unsettle what is essentially established and teacheshow to supply wickedness with grounds. This is the view expressed in the Socratic dialectic against that ofthe Sophists, and this is the indignation which, turned in the opposite direction, cost even Socrates his life.The vulgar refutation that opposes to thinking, as did Diogenes, sensuous consciousness and imagines that inthe latter it possesses the truth, must be left to itself; but in so far as dialectic abrogates moral determinations,we must have confidence in reason that it will know how to restore them again, but restore them in their truthand in the consciousness of their right, though also of their limitations. Or again, the conclusion of subjectivenullity may mean that it does not affect dialectic itself, but rather the cognition against which it is directedand in the view of scepticism and likewise of the Kantian philosophy, cognition in general. § 1794 Science of LogicThe Absolute Idea161"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The fundamental prejudice in this matter is that dialectic has only a negative result, a point which willpresently be more precisely defined. First of all as regards the above−mentioned form in which dialectic isusually presented, it is to be observed that according to that form the dialectic and its result affect the subjectmatter under consideration or else subjective cognition, and declare either the latter or the subject matter to benull and void, while on the other hand the determinations exhibited in the subject matter as in a third thingreceive no attention and are presupposed as valid on their own account. It is an infinite merit of the Kantian Philosophy to have drawn attention to this uncritical procedure and by sodoing to have given the impetus to the restoration of logic and dialectic in the sense of the examination of thedeterminations of thought in and for themselves. The subject matter kept apart from thinking and the Notion,is an image or even a name; it is in the determinations of thought and the Notion that it is what it is. Thereforethese determinations are in fact the sole thing that matters; they are the true subject matter and content ofreason, and anything else that one understands by subject matter and content in distinction from them asvalue only through them and in them. It must not therefore be considered the fault of a subject matter or ofcognition that these determinations, through their constitution and an external connection, show themselvesdialectical. On that assumption, the subject matter or the cognition is represented as a subject into which thedeterminations in the form of predicates, properties, self−subsistent universals, are introduced in such amanner that, fixed and correct as they are by themselves, they are brought into dialectical relationships andcontradiction only by extraneous and contingent connection in and by a third thing. This kind of external andfixed subject of imagination and understanding and these abstract determinations, far from meriting the statusof ultimates, of secure and permanent substrates, are rather to be regarded as themselves immediate, as justthat kind of presupposed and initial immediate that, as was shown above, must in its own essential nature [inand for itself] submit to dialectic, because it is to be taken as in itself the Notion. Thus all the oppositions that are assumed as fixed, as for example finite and infinite, individual and universal,are not in contradiction through, say, an external connection; on the contrary, as an examination of theirnature has shown, they are in and for themselves a transition; the synthesis and the subject in which theyappear is the product of their Notion's own reflection. If a consideration that ignores the Notion stops short attheir external relationship, isolates them and leaves them as fixed presuppositions, it is the Notion, on thecontrary, that keeps them steadily in view, moves them as their soul and brings out their dialectic. § 1795 Now this is the very standpoint indicated above from which a universal first, considered in and for itself,shows itself to be the other of itself. Taken quite generally, this determination can be taken to mean that what is at first immediate now appears asmediated, related to an other, or that the universal appears as a particular. Hence the second term that hasthereby come into being is the negative of the first, and if we anticipate the subsequent progress, the firstnegative. The immediate, from this negative side, has been extinguished in the other, but the other isessentially not the empty negative, the nothing, that is taken to be the usual result of dialectic; rather is it theother of the first, the negative of the immediate; it is therefore determined as the mediated −− contains ingeneral the determination of the first within itself. Consequently the first is essentially preserved and retainedeven in the other. To hold fast to the positive in its negative, in the content of the presupposition, in the result,this is the most important feature in rational cognition; at the same time only the simplest reflection is neededto convince one of the absolute truth and necessity of this requirement and so far as examples of the proof ofthis are concerned, the whole of logic consists solely of such. § 1796 Science of LogicThe Absolute Idea162"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Accordingly, what we now have before us is the mediated, which to begin with, or, if it is likewise takenimmediately, is also a simple determination; for as the first has been extinguished in it, only the second ispresent. Now since the first also is contained in the second, and the latter is the truth of the former, this unitycan be expressed as a proposition in which the immediate is put as subject, and the mediated as its predicate;for example, the finite, one is infinite, one is many, the individual is the universal. However, the inadequateform of such propositions is at once obvious. In treating of the judgement it has been shown that its form ingeneral, and most of all the immediate form of the positive judgement, is incapable of holding within itsgrasp speculative determinations and truth. The direct supplement to it, the negative judgement, would atleast have to be added as well. In the judgement the first, as subject, has the illusory show of aself−dependent subsistence, whereas it is sublated in its predicate as in its other; this negation is indeedcontained in the content of the above propositions, but their positive form contradicts the content;consequently what is contained in them is not posited −− which would be precisely the purpose of employinga proposition. § 1797 The second determination, the negative or mediated, is at the same time also the mediating determination. Itmay be taken in the first instance as a simple determination, but in its truth it is a relation or relationship; forit is the negative, but the negative of the positive, and includes the positive within itself. It is therefore theother, but not the other of something to which it is indifferent −− in that case it would not be an other, nor arelation or relationship −− rather it is the other in its own self, the other of an other; therefore it includes itsown other within it and is consequently as contradiction, the posited dialectic of itself. Because the first or theimmediate is implicitly the Notion, and consequently is also only implicitly the negative, the dialecticalmoment with it consists in positing in it the difference that it implicitly contains. The second, on the contrary,is itself the determinate moment, the difference or relationship; therefore with it the dialectical momentconsists in positing the unity that is contained in it. § 1798 If then the negative, the determinate, relationship, judgement, and all the determinations falling under thissecond moment do not at once appear on their own account as contradiction and as dialectical. this is solelythe fault of a thinking that does not bring its thoughts together. For the material, the opposed determinationsin one relation, is already posited and at hand for thought. But formal thinking makes identity its law, andallows the contradictory content before it to sink into the sphere of ordinary conception, into space and time,in which the contradictories are held asunder in juxtaposition and temporal succession and so come beforeconsciousness without reciprocal contact. On this point, formal thinking lays down for its principle that contradiction is unthinkable: but as a matter offact the thinking of contradiction is the essential moment of the Notion. Formal thinking does in fact thinkcontradiction, only it at once looks away from it, and in saying that it is unthinkable it merely passes overfrom it into abstract negation. § 1799 Now the negativity just considered constitutes the turning point of the movement of the Notion. It is thesimple point of the negative relation to self, the innermost source of all activity of all animate and spiritualself−movement, the dialectical soul that everything true possesses and through which alone it is true; for onthis subjectivity alone rests the sublating of the opposition between the Notion and reality, and the unity thatis truth. The second negative, the negative of the negative, at which we have arrived, is this sublating of thecontradiction, but just as little as the contradiction is it an act of external reflection, but rather the innermost,most objective moment of life and spirit through which a subject, a person, a free being, exists. Science of LogicThe Absolute Idea163"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"§ 1800 The relation of the negative to itself is to be regarded as the second premise of the whole syllogism. If theterms analytic and synthetic are employed as opposites, the first premise may be regarded as the analyticmoment, for in it the immediate stands in immediate relationship to its other and therefore passes over, orrather has passed over, into it −− although this relation, as already remarked, is also synthetic, preciselybecause that into which it passes over is its other. The second premise here under consideration may bedefined as synthetic, since it is the relation of the differentiated term as such to the term from which it isdifferentiated. Just as the first premise is the moment of universality and communication, so the second isdetermined by individuality, which in its relation to its other is primarily exclusive, for itself, and different.The negative appears as the mediating element, since it includes within it itself and the immediate whosenegation it is. So far as these two determinations are taken in some relationship or other as externally related,the negative is only the formal mediating element; but as absolute negativity the negative moment of absolutemediation is the unity which is subjectivity and soul. § 1801 In this turning point of the method, the course of cognition at the same time returns into itself. Asself−sublating contradiction this negativity is the restoration of the first immediacy, of simple universality;for the other of the other, the negative of the negative, is immediately the positive, the identical, the universal.If one insists on counting, this second immediate is, in the course of the method as a whole, the third term tothe first immediate and the mediated. It is also, however, the third term to the first or formal negative and toabsolute negativity or the second negative; now as the first negative is already the second term, the termreckoned as third can also be reckoned as fourth, and instead of a triplicity, the abstract form may be taken asa quadruplicity; in this way, the negative or the difference is counted as a duality. The third or fourth is ingeneral the unity of the first and second moments, of the immediate and the mediated. That it is this unity, asalso that the whole form of the method is a triplicity, is, it is true, merely the superficial external side of themode of cognition; but to have demonstrated even this, and that too in a more specific application −− for it iswell known that the abstract number form itself was advanced at quite an early period, but, in the absence ofthe Notion, without result −− must also be regarded as an infinite merit of the Kantian philosophy. § 1802 The syllogism, which is threefold, has always been recognised as the universal form of reason; but for onething it counted generally for a quite external form that did not determine the nature of the content, and foranother thing, since it progresses in the formal sense merely in the understanding's determination of identity,it lacks the essential dialectical moment of negativity; yet this moment enters into the triplicity ofdeterminations because the third is the unity of the first two, and these, since they are different, can be in theunity only as sublated determinations. Formalism has, it is true, also taken possession of triplicity andadhered to its empty schema; the shallow ineptitude and barrenness of modern philosophic constructionso−called, that consists in nothing but fastening this schema on to everything without Notion and immanentdetermination and employing it for an external arrangement, has made the said form tedious and given it abad name. Yet the triteness of this use of it cannot detract from its inner worth and we must always valuehighly the discovery of the shape of the rational, even though it was at first uncomprehended. § 1803 Now more precisely the third is the immediate, but the immediate resulting from sublation of mediation, thesimple resulting from sublation of difference, the positive resulting from sublation of the negative, the Notionthat has realised itself by means of its otherness and by the sublation of this reality has become united withitself, and has restored its absolute reality, its simple relation to itself. This result is therefore the truth. It is Science of LogicThe Absolute Idea164"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"equally immediacy and mediation; but such forms of judgement as: the third is immediacy and mediation, orit is the unity of them, are not capable of grasping it; for it is not a quiescent third, but, precisely as this unity,is self−mediating movement and activity. As that with which we began was the universal, so the result is theindividual, the concrete, the subject; what the former is in itself the latter is now equally for itself, theuniversal is posited in the subject. The first two moments of the triplicity are abstract, untrue moments whichfor that very reason are dialectical, and through this their negativity make themselves into the subject. TheNotion itself is for us, in the first instance, alike the universal that is in itself, and the negative that is foritself, and also the third, that which is both in and for itself, the universal that runs through all the moments ofhe syllogism, but the third is the conclusion, in which the Notion through its negativity is mediated with itselfand thereby posited for itself as the universal and the identity of its moments. § 1804 Now this result, as the whole that has withdrawn into and is identical with itself, has given itself again theform of immediacy. Hence it is now itself the same thing as the starting−point had determined itself to be. Assimple self−relation it is a universal, and in this universality, the negativity that constituted its dialectic andmediation has also collapsed into simple determinateness which can again be a beginning. It may seem at firstsight that this cognition of the result is an analysis of it and therefore must again dissect these determinationsand the process by which it has come into being and been examined. But if the treatment of the subject matteris actually carried out in this analytic manner, it belongs to that stage of the Idea considered above, to thecognition of enquiry, which merely states of its subject matter what is, but not the necessity of its concreteidentity and the Notion of it. But though the method of truth which comprehends the subject matter is, as wehave shown, itself analytic, for it remains entirely within the Notion, yet it is equally synthetic, for throughthe Notion the subject matter is determined dialectically and as an other. On the new foundation constitutedby the result as the fresh subject matter, the method remains the same as with the previous subject matter. Thedifference is concerned solely with the relationship of the foundation as such; true, it is now likewise afoundation, but its immediacy is only a form, since it was a result as well; hence its determinateness ascontent is no longer something merely picked up, but something deduced and proved. § 1805 It is here that the content of cognition as such first enters into the circle of consideration, since, as deduced, itnow belongs to the method. The method itself by means of this moment expands itself into a system. At firstthe beginning had to be, for the method, wholly indeterminate in respect of content; to this extent it appearsas the merely formal soul, for and by which the beginning was determined simply and solely in regard to itsform, namely, as the immediate and the universal. Through the movement we have indicated, the subjectmatter has obtained for itself a determinateness that is a content, because the negativity that has withdrawninto simplicity is the sublated form, and as simple determinateness stands over against its development, andfirst of all over against its very opposition to universality. § 1806 Now as this determinateness is the proximate truth of the indeterminate beginning, it condemns the latter assomething imperfect, as well as the method itself that, in starting from that beginning, was merely formal.This can be expressed as the now specific demand that the beginning, since it is itself a determinate relativelyto the determinateness of the result, shall be taken not as an immediate but as something mediated anddeduced. This may appear as the demand for an infinite retrogression in proof and deduction; just as from thefresh beginning that has been obtained, a result likewise emerges from the method in its course, so that theadvance equally rolls onwards to infinity. § 1807 Science of LogicThe Absolute Idea165"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"It has been shown a number of times that the infinite progress as such belongs to reflection that is without theNotion; the absolute method, which has the Notion for its soul and content, cannot lead into that. At firstsight, even such beginnings as being, essence, universality, seem to be of such a kind as to possess thecomplete universality and absence of content demanded for a wholly formal beginning, as it is supposed tobe, and therefore, as absolutely first beginnings, demand and admit of no further regress. As they are purerelations to self, immediate and indeterminate, they do not of course possess within themselves the differencewhich in any other kind of beginning, is directly posited between the universality of its form and its content.But it is the very indeterminateness which the above logical beginnings have for their sole content thatconstitutes their determinateness; this consists, namely, in their negativity as sublated mediation; theparticularity of this gives even their indeterminateness a particularity by which being, essence, anduniversality are distinguished from one another. The determinateness then which belongs to them if they aretaken by themselves is their immediate determinateness, just as much as the determinateness of any otherkind of content, and therefore requires a deduction; for the method it is a matter of indifference whether thedeterminateness be taken as determinateness of form or of content. That a content has been determined by thefirst of its results is not in fact for the method, the beginning of a new mode; the method remains neither morenor less formal than before. For since it is the absolute form, the Notion that knows itself and everything asNotion, there is no content that could stand over against it and determine it to be a one−sided external form. § 1808 Consequently, just as the absence of content in the above beginnings does not make them absolutebeginnings, so too it is not the content as such that could lead the method into the infinite progress forwardsor backwards. From one aspect, the determinateness which the method creates for itself in its result is themoment by means of which the method is self−mediation and converts the immediate beginning intosomething mediated. But conversely, it is through the determinateness that this mediation of the method runsits course; it returns through a content as through an apparent other of itself to its beginning in such a mannerthat not only does it restore that beginning −− as a determinate beginning however −− but the result is no lessthe sublated determinateness, and so too the restoration of the first immediacy in which it began. This itaccomplishes as a system of totality. We have still to consider it in this determination. § 1809 We have shown that the determinateness which was a result is itself, by virtue of the form of simplicity intowhich it has withdrawn, a fresh beginning; as this beginning is distinguished from its predecessor preciselyby that determinateness, cognition rolls onwards from content to content First of all, this advance isdetermined as beginning from simple determinatenesses the succeeding ones becoming ever richer and moreconcrete. For the result contains its beginning and its course has enriched it by a fresh determinateness. Theuniversal constitutes the foundation; the advance is therefore not to be taken as a flowing from one other tothe next other. In the absolute method the Notion maintains itself in its otherness. the universal in itsparticularisation, in judgement and reality; at each stage of its further determination it raises the entire massof its preceding content, and by its dialectical advance it not only does not lose anything or leave anythingbehind, but carries along with it all it has gained, and inwardly enriches and consolidates itself. § 1810 This expansion may be regarded as the moment of content, and in the whole as the first premise; the universalis communicated to the wealth of content, immediately maintained in it. But the relationship has also itssecond, negative or dialectical side. The enrichment proceeds in the necessity of the Notion, it is held by it,and each determination is a reflection−into−self. Each new stage of forthgoing, that is, of furtherdetermination, is also a withdrawal inwards, and the greater extension is equally a higher intensity. Science of LogicThe Absolute Idea166"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"§ 1811 The richest is therefore the most concrete and most subjective and that which withdraws itself into thesimplest depth is the mightiest and most all−embracing. The highest; most concentrated point is the purepersonality which, solely through the absolute dialectic which is its nature, no less embraces and holdseverything within itself, because it makes itself the supremely free −− the simplicity which is the firstimmediacy and universality. § 1812 It is in this manner that each step of the advance in the process of further determination, while getting furtheraway from the indeterminate beginning is also getting back nearer to it, and that therefore, what at first sightmay appear to be different, the retrogressive grounding of the beginning, and the progressive furtherdetermining of it, coincide and are the same. The method, which thus winds itself into a circle, cannotanticipate in a development in time that the beginning is, as such, already something derived; it is sufficientfor the beginning in its immediacy that it is simple universality. In being that, it has its complete condition;and there is no need to deprecate the fact that it may only be accepted provisionally and hypothetically.Whatever objections to it might be raised −− say, the limitations of human knowledge, the need to examinecritically the instrument of cognition before starting to deal with the subject matter −− are themselvespresuppositions, which as concrete determinations involve the demand for their mediation and proof. Sincetherefore they possess no formal advantage over the beginning with the subject matter against which theyprotest, but on the contrary themselves require deduction on account of their more concrete content, theirclaim to prior consideration must be treated as an empty presumption. They have an untrue content, for theyconvert what we know to be finite and untrue into something incontestable and absolute, namely, a limitedcognition determined as form and instrument relatively to its content; this untrue cognition is itself also theform, the process of seeking grounds, that is retrogressive.. The method of truth, too, knows the beginning tobe incomplete, because it is a beginning; but at the same time it knows this incompleteness to be a necessity,because truth only comes to be itself through negativity of immediacy. § 1813 The impatience at insists merely on getting beyond the determinate −− whether called beginning, object, thefinite, or in whatever other form it be taken −− and finding itself immediately in the absolute, has before it ascognition nothing but the empty negative, the abstract infinite; in other words, a presumed absolute, that ispresumed because it is not posited, not grasped; grasped it can only be through the mediation of cognition, ofwhich the universal and immediate is a moment, but the truth itself resides only in the extended course of theprocess and in the conclusion. To meet the subjective needs of unfamiliarity and its impatience, a survey ofthe whole may of course be given in advance −− by a division for reflection which, after the manner of finitecognition, specifies the particular of the universal as something already there and to be awaited in the courseof the science. Yet this affords us nothing more than a picture for ordinary thinking; for the genuine transitionfrom the universal to the particular and to the whole that is determined in and for itself, in which whole thatfirst universal itself according to its true determination is again a moment, is alien to the above manner ofdivision, and is alone the mediation of the science itself. § 1814 By virtue of the nature of the method just indicated, the science exhibits itself as a circle returning upon itself,the end being wound back into the beginning, the simple ground, by the mediation; this circle is moreover acircle of circles, for each individual member as ensouled by the method is reflected into itself, so that inreturning into the beginning it is at the same time the beginning of a new member. Links of this chain are theindividual sciences [of logic, nature and spirit], each of which has an antecedent and a successor −− or, Science of LogicThe Absolute Idea167"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"expressed more accurately, has only the antecedent and indicates its successor in its conclusion. § 1815 Thus then logic, too, in the absolute Idea, has withdrawn into that same simple unity which its beginning is;the pure immediacy of being in which at first every determination appears to be extinguished or removed byabstraction, is the Idea that has reached through mediation, that is, through the sublation of mediation, alikeness correspondent to itself. The method is the Pure Notion that relates itself only to itself; it is thereforethe simple self−relation that is being. But now it is also fulfilled being, the Notion that comprehends itself,being as the concrete and so absolutely intensive totality. In conclusion, there remains only this to be saidabout this Idea, that in it, first, the science of logic has grasped its own Notion. § 1816 In the sphere of being, the beginning of its content, its Notion appears as a knowing in a subjective reflectionexternal to that content. But in the Idea of absolute cognition the Notion has become the Idea's own content.The Idea is itself the pure Notion that has itself for subject matter and which, in running itself as subjectmatter through the totality of its determinations, develops itself into the whole of its reality, into the system ofthe science [of logic], and concludes by apprehending this process of comprehending itself, therebysuperseding its standing as content and subject matter and cognising the Notion of the science. Secondly, this Idea is still logical, it is enclosed within pure thought and is the science only of the divineNotion. True, the systematic exposition is itself a realisation of the Idea but confined within the same sphere.Because the pure Idea of cognition is so far confined within subjectivity, it is the urge to sublate this, andpure truth as the last result becomes also the beginning of another sphere and science. It only remains here toindicate this transition. § 1817 The Idea, namely, in positing itself as absolute unity of the pure Notion and its reality and thus contractingitself into the immediacy of being, is the totality in this form −− nature. But this determination has not issued from a process of becoming, nor is it a transition, as when above, thesubjective Notion in its totality becomes objectivity, and the subjective end becomes life. On the contrary, thepure Idea in which the determinateness or reality of the Notion is itself raised into Notion, is an absoluteliberation for which there is no longer any immediate determination that is not equally posited and itselfNotion; in this freedom, therefore, no transition takes place; the simple being to which the Idea determinesitself remains perfectly transparent to it and is the Notion that, in its determination, abides with itself. Thepassage is therefore to be understood here rather in this manner, that the Idea freely releases itself in itsabsolute self−assurance and inner poise. By reason of this freedom, the form of its determinateness is alsoutterly free −− the externality of space and time existing absolutely on its own account without the moment ofsubjectivity. In so far as this externality presents itself only in the abstract immediacy of being and isapprehended from the standpoint of consciousness, it exists as mere objectivity and external life; but in theIdea it remains essentially and actually [in and for itself] the totality of the Notion, and science in therelationship to nature of divine cognition. But in this next resolve of the pure Idea to determine itself as external Idea, it thereby only posits for itself themediation out of which the Notion ascends as a free Existence that has withdrawn into itself from exteranlity,that completes its self−liberation in the science of spirit, and that finds the supreme Notion of itself in thescience of logic as the self−comprehending pure Notion.
