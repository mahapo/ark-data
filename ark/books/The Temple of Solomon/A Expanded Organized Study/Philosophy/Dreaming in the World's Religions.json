If that is true, then the course of your life follows, and has alwaysfollowed, a cyclical pattern of waking and sleeping. Like other mammals, you aredeeply programmed in your brain and body to alternate between two dramaticallydifferent states of being. The survival benefits of being awake areobvious—that’s when you’re alert, focused, and active in the world, able toprovide for your basic physical needs. Less apparent are the survival benefitsof totally withdrawing from the world and going to sleep, but they are no lessvital. You need to sleep. Sleeping is just as essential to your healthyexistence as food or water. When you become tired it feels good to sleep, justas it feels good to eat when you’re hungry and drink when you’re thirsty.Conversely, it feels painful when you don’t get enough sleep. Just as you candie from lack of food or water, you would not last long if you were completelyprevented from sleeping. When laboratory animals are deprived of all sleep theyperish in a matter of days.As it is, you probably sleep between six and nine hours a night. Plenty ofpeople get by on less and others can’t function without more, but your averageratio of time spent awake and asleep is likely to be about 2:1, sixteen or sohours awake vs. eight or so hours asleep. In unusual circumstances (e.g., anatural disaster, a military battle, a family health crisis, a work or schooldeadline, a really good party) you may be able to stay awake for thirty-six ormore hours, but you’ll be in sad shape at the end of it. No one can fight thesleeping/waking cycle for long without suffering a big decrease in physical andemotional well-being.Every time you fall asleep your body passes through a series of complexalterations in breathing, heart beat, and muscular tonality. Your brain remainsactive during sleep, but not because of any external sensory stimulation ordeliberate intention on your part—rather, your brain is being stimulated byinternal sources that function independently of your waking self-awareness. Thebrain’s dynamic functioning in sleep is quite different from its activitypatterns while awake, and this is why your waking mind rarely recalls whathappens to you while you slumber each night. The exception is when you remembera dream.DREAMINGA dream is an imagined world of sights, sounds, thoughts, feelings, andactivities that you (either as a character in the dream or a disembodiedobserver of it) experience during sleep. Most people spontaneously remember oneor two dreams a week, though the memories may be fleeting and the imagesforgotten within a few minutes after waking. A few people recall several dreamseach night, while others say they never remember any dreams at all. Many of thedreams that people do remember are described as “bad” dreams, with frighteningimages and negative emotions that carry over from sleep into the waking state.Such nightmarish dreams occur especially often in childhood and adolescence, andperhaps two or three times a year for most adults. If you were asked “What isthe most frightening dream you’ve ever had?” I suspect you would have littledifficulty bringing to mind the memory of a nightmare that made an especiallystrong and disturbing impression on you when you woke up.What strikes most people about their dreams is how weird and bizarre theysometimes appear. A dream can put you any place, with anyone, doing anything—theordinary limitations of waking life are suspended, allowing for a seeminglyinfinite range of possible scenarios and interactions. Sometimes the experienceis positive (a joyful ability to fly), sometimes negative (being chased by apsycho killer), and sometimes it has no emotional content one way or the other.Most dreams include the basic narrative elements of a story (setting,characters, dialogue, action, plot), though often in strangely fragmented anddistorted forms. Oddities abound in dreams—sudden shifts of time and location,strange mixtures of people and personalities, inexplicable behavior andfeelings, extraordinary abilities and powers. Nothing is impossible in dreams.Everything seems to be permissible.The weirdness of dreaming is only half the story, however. The other half is thenormality of dreaming, its predictable continuity with the mundane reality ofwaking life. If you look at a person’s dreams over time you will find that thebasic patterns of dream content offer a remarkably accurate and consistentportrait of that person’s major waking life activities, relationships, andemotional concerns. It is a commonsense idea, really—your dreams reflect who youare and what is most important in your daily existence. If you are a collegestudent, you probably dream about classes, teachers, and dorm life; if a doctoror therapist, you probably dream about patients, colleagues, and offices; if youlove playing or watching baseball or both, you will likely dream about thatsport; and if you have three sisters and your relationship with the middle oneis the closest and most intense, you probably dream about her more often thanabout the other two. Whatever the circumstances, your dreams are rooted in theparticular conditions of your waking world. Whereas some dreams may be bizarreand outlandish, most seem rather ordinary, normal, and reality-based. You tendto be in places you know, with people you recognize, doing the kinds of thingsyou do in daily life.Dreams are thus a complex weaving together of the strange and the familiar, andthis is true for everyone whose dream life has been systematically studied. Thisleads to the first idea I want to emphasize. The basic patterns of your sleepingand dreaming are shared by all humans. Such patterns are a deeply instinctualcharacteristic of our species. The study of dreams is therefore a necessarysource of insight for our knowledge of what it means to be human. The theoriesof philosophers, theologians, and psychologists will never do justice to thefullness of our existence if they only focus on the qualities of waking life.We now have available, thanks to the effort of many excellent historical andanthropological studies, a wealth of information showing that people in manydifferent places and times have expressed their dreams by means of talking aboutthem, recording them, interpreting them, acting them out in rituals, and drawingcreative inspiration from their meanings. This leads to a second idea I want tohighlight. Dreaming has always been regarded as a religious phenomenon.Throughout history, in cultures worldwide, people have seen their dreams firstand foremost as religiously meaningful experiences. In this widely shared view,dreams are a powerful medium of transpersonal guidance offering the opportunityto communicate with sacred beings, gain valuable wisdom and power, healsuffering, and explore new realms of existence. The historical andcross-cultural evidence is overwhelming on this point: religion is the primaryarena in which humans have traditionally expressed their dreams. Whetherdreaming is the origin of religion is a separate question, to which we’ll returnin a moment. As a matter of historical fact, however, this book will show thatdreams have played a powerful, complex, and dynamic role in the world’sreligious and spiritual traditions.Putting the same point in research-oriented terms, the world’s religious andspiritual traditions provide the best source of historical information about thebroad phenomenological patterns of human dream life. Long before modernpsychology arose in mid-nineteenth-century Europe, religiously minded people allover the globe were studying, experimenting with, and theorizing about theworkings of the dreaming mind. This is where the study of dreams begins. Therelevance of religious history for contemporary dream research is enormous, andthe time has come for a fundamental reorientation of the field to acknowledgethis. We should accept no general theory of dreams (and certainly no theorycalling itself scientific) that ignores such a vast source of evidence. Tounderstand human nature, we must study dreams. To understand dreams, we muststudy religion.This book provides an integrated overview of the multiple roles that dreams haveplayed through history in the world’s religious traditions. It explores thelively interaction between dreaming and religion, tracing the influences in bothdirections—how individual dreams have shaped religious traditions and howreligious traditions have fed back into personal dream experience. The bookalso, I suspect, will reveal new ways in which your dreams are threads in a muchlarger tapestry continuously created by the dreaming instincts of humankind.Indeed, you may find as you read along that you begin remembering more of yourdreams than usual. That happens, at any rate, to many people when they read abook on dreams, and it is one small indication of the continuous interaction ofwaking and dreaming experience. Dreams have often been compared to a mirror thatreflects the true character of the dreamer. What happens when the individualface in the mirror sees itself reflected in the collective dream mirror of allhumanity?RELIGIONSIf dreaming is a complex phenomenon that eludes simple definition, then surelythe same must be said of religion. The exact meaning of “religion” has beennotoriously difficult to pin down in a satisfying way, and it is tempting tothink we should abandon the word altogether.1 [notes.html#introfn1] The mainproblem is the Christian bias built into the term. Rooted in the Latin verbreligare (“tie back” or “tie tight”), religion was originally used in the fifthcentury C.E. to describe Christian monasticism and the practice of bindingoneself to the rule of a church order. As an etymological and ideologicalconsequence, Christianity has been regarded by Western academics as theprototypical religion by which all other traditions are measured (and usuallyfound lacking). Even worse, the emphasis on the singular noun “religion”obscures the dynamic personal qualities of religious life and the colorfulpluralism of its expression. This leads to reified academic categories that arethen analyzed and compared in a quasi-scientific fashion, producing allegedlyuniversal patterns of human religiosity bearing little relation to the lives ofactual people. The dangers of this kind of abstract, totalizing research havebeen well documented in recent years, and scholars today are (or should be) muchmore careful in launching comparative investigations.That said, the term “religion” remains useful if properly employed. In this bookit is used as a shorthand word for an awareness of powers that transcend humancontrol or understanding and yet have a formative influence on, and activepresence within, human life. In many traditions these trans-human powers arerepresented in the form of gods, spirits, ancestors, mythic beings, and forcesof nature. All religions venerate certain places, objects, and texts because oftheir capacity to bring people closer to these powers, and special practices(e.g., pilgrimage, sacrifice, dance, music, prayer, meditation) are performed toenhance their benevolent, life-affirming influence on people’s lives. Althoughhuman existence may be filled with pain and misfortune, religions teach variousmethods for overcoming that suffering, either in this life or in another one tocome, by means of harmonizing one’s thoughts, feelings, and behavior withtranscendent forces. One way religions achieve this is by creating andsustaining a personal sense of connection to a community. Religious traditionshave developed various systems to bind (religare) people together over the spanof multiple generations, carrying on valuable ancestral wisdom and preparing thegroup for future challenges and opportunities. Aligned with thatcommunity-building function, religions usually promote moral teachings to guidepeople’s behavior in relation to both humans and the trans-human powers.This does not mean that religion should only be viewed in a positive light. Onthe contrary, we must avoid idealizing the “goodness” of religion. In a bookdevoted to a broad view of human history, we will have many opportunities tolament religion’s perennial involvement with xenophobia, violence, and war. Inthe process of creating a life-enhancing community for some people, religionshave actively worked to fight, conquer, and destroy other people who do notbelong to their community. Religion has hardly been a purely benevolentinfluence in human life, as any contemporary observer of world events canattest.Defined in this way, the term “religion” does not automatically elevate orprivilege Christianity, nor does it ignore the personal dynamics and variableexpressions of lived human experience. Most important for the purposes of thisbook, it provides a good framework for the comparative study of dreaming. Recallnow the initial definition of a dream: an imagined world of sights, sounds,thoughts, feelings, and activities that you (either as a character in the dreamor a disembodied observer of it) experience during sleep. We may now add to thatdefinition by saying the imagined worlds in dreaming can be religious worldsinsofar as they relate to the characteristics just outlined: encounters withtrans-human powers, efforts to heal suffering, practices of communal bonding,and violent conflicts with outsiders. In the following chapters, thesedimensions of religious dreaming will be explored in many different traditions,with special attention to the personal circumstances of the dreamer and thefluid, dynamic processes by which the dreaming imagination interacts withculture, language, history, and waking cognition. I do not argue that dreamingis the origin of religion as such; rather, my thesis is more focused: dreamingis a primal wellspring of religious experience. The natural rootedness ofdreaming in the human brain-mind system makes it a universally available sourceof experiential awareness of precisely those powers that people havehistorically associated with religion. Whether dreaming came before religion orreligion came before dreaming is an impossible question to answer. Either way,the historical relationship between the two is strong and clear and worthexploring in more detail.HISTORIESThe next step in this scholarly ritual of introductory definitions is toconsider issues of history and geography. Short of a Borgesian encyclopedia ofall dreams from all people through all time, which would require the addition ofseveral billion new entries every night, decisions must be made about whichplaces and eras can and cannot be represented. The most common path taken bybooks on world religions is to focus attention on those traditions with thelargest contemporary populations and widest geographic distributions. ThusChristianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism usually head the list of the majorworld faiths. This approach makes some sense, but it is flawed by an overlynarrow perspective and a lack of historical awareness. It devalues smaller, lesswidespread religious traditions and it completely ignores the dynamics ofhistorical change by which “minor” religions become “major” ones, and viceversa. Also, an approach that starts by measuring traditions according to theircontemporary size and power automatically positions Christianity as theprototypical religion, which leads straight back to the distortions ofcomparative knowledge already mentioned.A slight improvement would be to start with the oldest enduring religioustraditions and work our way to the present. Accordingly, Jainism and Hinduismmight come first, then Judaism, Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and onward toChristianity, Islam, and perhaps finally the Church of Latter Day Saints. Thisis better than the “major faiths” approach, but it still ignores vast realms ofhuman religious life. Left out are smaller contemporary traditions, pasttraditions that are now extinct, and any religious group whose experiences andteachings are not easily captured in the conceptual framework of an “ism.”An entirely different approach is to begin one’s historical investigation withthe early ancestral environment of the human species, namely, the Africansavannah of approximately two hundred thousand years ago, and move forward fromthere. This is the approach favored by evolutionary scientists.2[notes.html#introfn2] It explains universal human phenomena like religion anddreaming by reference to the forces of natural selection that produced thehighly adaptive cognitive abilities of the human mind. These abilities gave ourspecies the power to survive and dominate not just in our primal Africanhomeland but in virtually every region and environment around the world.According to a generally accepted time line, the first anatomically modernhumans migrated from Africa around 50,000 BCE and quickly spread throughoutEurasia (driving the Neanderthals to extinction in the process), into Australiaby 40,000 BCE (wiping out all native large mammals within a few generations),farther north into the icy cold of Siberia by 20,000 BCE (good-bye to the WoolyMammoth), and across the Bering Strait and into North America by 12,000 BCE. Ittook only a thousand years for humans to spread throughout the Americas, and formany native species of large mammals to become extinct. Thus, a study of humanhistory that takes this bloody time line into account would start with thereligious cultures of Africa, then move to Eurasia, Australia, Northwest Asia,the Americas, and finally Oceania (the chains of tropical islands stretchingwestward from Australia that were settled in the early centuries of the commonera).An evolutionary approach like this has many virtues. It relies on solidarcheological and biological evidence; it foregrounds the adaptive abilities andadventurous spirit of the human species; and it casts a painful but honest lighton the violent instincts that have enabled us to become the most powerfulcreatures on the planet. It is not, however, a sufficient means of understandingreligion or dreaming. Evolutionary science as currently practiced is too quickto reduce the wondrous pluralism of human experience to a few simple,predetermined theoretical categories. What is missing is an appreciation forsomething we have already insisted on emphasizing: the dynamic, creative,open-ended qualities of human life. The human mind has not simply evolved; it isevolving. As evolutionary scientists have shown in great detail, the tremendouscognitive abilities of our species have developed over time in direct responseto pressing interests stimulated by environmental forces on people’s lives.There is no reason to suppose this process stopped two hundred thousand yearsago or fifty thousand ago or at any time whatsoever. Indeed, it is possible andperhaps even likely that religion has evolved, and is evolving, in human life aspart of an ongoing process of responding to the ever new challenges confrontinga species with unique cognitive abilities for language, social interchange,consciousness, memory, and reason.3 [notes.html#introfn3] Likewise for dreaming:it may have evolved, and still be evolving, in a continuous process ofinteraction with the relentlessly changing natural and social environments inwhich we live. If we agree that evolution has not finished with us yet but isstill an ongoing force in human life, these possibilities should be consideredand explored.Taking all these factors into consideration, I devised the following approach toorganizing the book’s chapters, which trace three broad historical continuities.I start with Hinduism in chapter 1 [ch01.html#ch01], move to the religions ofChina (principally Confucianism and Daoism) in chapter 2 [ch02.html#ch02] andthen Buddhism in chapter 3 [ch03.html#ch03]. These closely related traditionsare among the largest and most ancient in the world. They offer an abundance ofteachings, myths, and practices for study, and they remain prominent religiousforces in the world today. For these reasons (in addition to the virtue ofimmediately de-centering Western Christian readers), the book starts with them.The second continuity begins in chapter 4 [ch04.html#ch04] with the religions ofthe Fertile Crescent (including the traditions of Mesopotamia, Egypt, andJudaism), followed by the religions of Greece and Rome in chapter 5[ch05.html#ch05], then Christianity in chapter 6 [ch06.html#ch06] and Islam inchapter 7 [ch07.html#ch07]. These traditions have deeply influenced one anotherthrough history, and many benefits will come from considering them in thissequence. The third continuity focuses on people and regions whose religioustraditions have been violently transformed over the past few centuries by themilitary, economic, and cultural impact of modernization. Although the religionsof Africa (chapter 8 [ch08.html#ch08]), Oceania (chapter 9 [ch09.html#ch09]),and the Americas (chapter 10 [ch10.html#ch10]) have rarely interacted with oneanother, they share the historical experience of being relatively small-scale,oral traditions that were attacked and conquered by colonizing forces. In eachof these cases we have imperfect knowledge of the “pre-contact” culture, sincemost of the earliest written information was provided by the colonizing forcesthemselves. Nevertheless, all three of these regions provide abundant evidenceof the bursts of new religious creativity that are provoked by situations ofdire conflict, severe cultural change, and danger to the community. Dreaming, aswe shall see, has played a prominent role in that process.Ten chapters in total, then—artificial, limited, and exclusive as all historicalcategorizations must be but at least mindful of the common pitfalls that lieahead.DREAM SCIENCEJust as religious history is a vital resource for the scientific study ofdreams, the reverse is also true—scientific research is a vital resource for thestudy of religious dreaming. Four areas of contemporary scientific researchdeserve particular consideration as we prepare to investigate and compare thevarious roles of dreaming in the world’s religions: the neuro-physiology ofsleep, the frequency of dream recall, the relationship between continuity andbizarreness, and prototypical dreams.First, let us consider the neurophysiology of sleep. Dreaming, as I have definedit, is a phenomenon that occurs during sleep. This is not to deny the kinship ofdreaming with vision, trance, possession, hallucination, and other extraordinarystates of consciousness that occur while awake or in other conditions differentfrom both sleeping and waking. Rather, it is to highlight the natural emergenceof human dreaming within the mammalian sleep state, and thus to open importantavenues for understanding how dreams relate to bodily development, biologicalfunctioning, and evolutionary adaptation.4 [notes.html#introfn4]As far as we know, the sleep cycle appeared rather late in animal evolution.Reptiles and fish can be observed in lengthy periods of relative calm andquiescence with reduced responsiveness to the external environment, a basicbehavioral pattern that qualifies as sleeping. However, only with the emergenceof birds and especially mammals did a rhythmic sleep cycle develop by whichperiods of quiescence alternate with periods of heightened brain-mindactivation. Using the electroencephalograph (EEG) to measure the electricalactivity of the brain, researchers have found that sleep onset regularly leadsto a slowing of cerebral activity, with simpler, lower-energy brain waves thanthose found in the waking state. In mammals and birds, this slow wave sleep(SWS) is followed by a shift to a faster and more complex phase of brainactivity. In humans, several other somatic changes occur in coordination withthis shift: a relaxation of major muscle groups (known as atonia), loss of bodytemperature regulation, twitching of the eyes under the lids, and an increase inrespiration and heartbeat (leading to an increased blood flow to the genitals,producing penile erections in men and clitoral swelling in women). These periodsof heightened brain arousal also include ponto-geniculo-occipital, or PGO,“spikes,” named for the structures in which they appear most predominantly.These are lightning-like bursts of neural firing that shoot from the brain steminto the forebrain. Researchers have not yet connected PGO spikes to anyparticular kind of dream content, nor do they even understand why we have PGOspikes in the first place. But they represent an essential activity of thesleeping brain, and later in the book we discover possible connections betweensuch flashes of neural excitement and the experience of religiously powerfuldreams.During sleep, the chemistry of the brain changes dramatically, as differentcombinations of neurotransmitters flow through the body. The brain stemregulates this complex chemical balancing act, indicating that this part of thebrain is the anatomical center triggering the sleep cycle, with the region knownas the pons having an especially crucial role in generating those PGO spikes.Recent research using brain imaging technologies has revealed that in humans theonset of sleep leads to diminished activity in the dorsolateral prefrontalcortex (DLPFC). This part of the brain is very active in the waking state, whenit serves as the “executive” center for such important mental functions asselective attention, purposeful action, decision making, and short-term memory.When the brain goes to sleep and moves from slow wave activities into thosephases of heightened arousal, the DLFPC is reduced to its lowest levels ofactivation. In its place various other brain regions become much more active,and together they form an integrated neural system. These sleep-intensifiedbrain areas include the limbic region (associated with negative emotions, sexualand aggressive instincts, and long-term memory formation), the extrastriatevisual cortex (responsible for secondary visual processing and imagery), themedial prefrontal cortex (supporting the capacity for empathy and intuiting theminds of other people), and other cortical areas involved in multimodal sensoryassociation. Research in this area is providing an increasingly well-definedportrait of the cognitive capacities of the dreaming imagination. Throughout thebook, we explore the multiple correlations between this research and the mostprominent features of religiously charged dream experience.We should pause to reflect on yet another issue of definition. What should thesehighly aroused phases of mammalian and avian sleep be called? Two terms havebeen employed by contemporary sleep scientists: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,named after the easily observable feature of the eyes twitching under theeyelids, and paradoxical sleep (PS), so designated because of itsself-contradictory character of being very far from waking in some ways and yetvery close to waking in others. Most research has been conducted using the term“REM,” with the quiescent phases of sleep known collectively as non-rapid eyemovement (NREM) sleep. The phases of NREM are further subdivided into NREMstages 1, 2, 3, and 4. A typical sleep cycle involves a person going to sleepand entering NREM stage 1, followed by NREM stages 2, 3, and 4, and thenentering the first REM phase of the night; after some time in REM, the personwould go back to stage 1 NREM, then onward through the other stages andeventually to another REM phase. One complete cycle of all the sleep stagesaverages about ninety minutes in length, and a person experiences four or fiveof them each night. Toward the end of the night, NREM stages 3 and 4 tend todrop out, and a person’s sleep alternates almost entirely between REM and NREMstage 2.However, paradoxical sleep refers to the same cluster of neurophysiologicalprocesses as REM sleep, and the two terms are used interchangeably in the book.So, too, are the terms “NREM” and “SWS,” even though both are excessivelygeneral in scope, lumping together many distinct and fascinating sleep phenomenathat occur outside of REM or PS (e.g., the brief bursts of imagery at thebeginning of NREM stage 1, the very low-frequency brain waves of early nightNREM stage 4, and the dreamlike qualities of late night NREM stage 2). At somefuture point, these terms will probably be discarded in favor of more preciseconceptualizations of the complex, multifaceted ebb and flow of sleepingexperience.Several facts confirm the basic idea that the sleep cycle is an instinctivebehavior necessary for survival. The simplest way to demonstrate this is bymeans of sleep deprivation experiments. Depriving an animal of sleep leadsfairly quickly to a decrease in physical well-being and weakened responsivenessto the environment, ultimately with fatal consequences. In humans, cognitiveabilities suffer tremendously after just one missed night’s sleep, and after afew days the emotional suffering becomes so acute that no ethically responsibleresearch has pursued the matter further. It is interesting that when thedeprivation stops and the person is again allowed a normal night’s sleep, thereis a major “rebound” effect in which the person sleeps many more hours thanusual. Also proving this point are lesion studies showing that major damage tovarious parts of the brain produces only temporary effects on the sleepcycle—even after severe damage, the brain keeps the wake-sleep cycle going. Itseems that mammalian and avian brains are strongly predisposed to maintain thiscycle, even if it means rapidly developing new neural connections to make up forsudden, traumatic disruptions.In all mammals, the beginning of life is when they experience the highestproportion of sleep with intensified brain activation. Fetuses and newborns havemuch more paradoxical sleep than adults do (up to 80 percent of sleep in humanbabies is spent in REM), which indicates a close relationship between this stageof sleep and the growth of the brain. Here is another curiosity inherent in theevolutionary nature of paradoxical sleep: it regularly reactivates in adults theprimary brain-mind processes of the earliest stages of child development.So a broad scientific picture of the sleep cycle has become fairly clear, evenif several mysteries remain about its variation among different species. Forexample, subterranean mammals like the mole and the blind mole rat have anabundance of PS, which casts doubt on any necessary connection between PS andprimary visual experience (though leaving open a possible connection between PS,mental imagery, and bodily orientation in space). The platypus and the spinyanteater, the only surviving members of the ancient line of monotremes(egg-laying mammals) have very little PS, which makes sense in light of theirneurological primitivity and premammalian tendencies. Unusually low amounts ofPS are also found among cetacean species like porpoises and bottle-noseddolphins. For these sea-dwelling creatures, SWS occurs in one cerebralhemisphere at a time—one side of their brain sleeps while the other side remainsawake. There is no obvious link between the amount of PS and general mentalability, and humans are somewhere in the middle of the pack on their proportionof PS. However, the human brain is far more densely interconnected than thebrain of any other species, so two hours of PS for a human is likely to haveexponentially greater neural complexity than, say, two hours of PS for ahamster.Before going further, yet another basic question needs to be addressed. What, ifanything, does the science of sleep tell us about dreaming? Sleep is aninstinctive process rooted in basic biological functions, whereas dreams arememories of imagined experiences. Are the two phenomena essentially the same orfundamentally different? Scholars of a humanistic bent may be tempted toemphasize the differences, but any attempt to separate the study of dreams fromscientific research on sleep makes it difficult to explain why dreaming displaysso many recurrent patterns that directly relate to our bodily growth andcognitive development. For empiricist investigators who favor physicalexplanations, any effort to explain dreaming exclusively in terms of sleepphysiology must contend with the classic mind-body problem of Westernphilosophy. Neuroscientific reductionism fails to account for mental causationin dreaming (e.g., in dreams with volition and self-awareness) or in waking(e.g., biofeedback, placebo effect), and it cannot convincingly translate thevivid personal experiences of dreaming into an objective language of electricaland chemical activities in the brain.The approach used here avoids the two extreme responses to this issue. Theneurophysiology of sleep does not tell us everything there is to know aboutdreams, but neither is it completely irrelevant to the subject. Manyexperiential features of dreaming are directly correlated with particularaspects of brain-mind functioning during sleep. If there needs to be aphilosophical name for the approach used in this book, it would be interactivedualism—a view that focuses on the dynamic interplay between the sleeping brainand the dreaming mind, leaving open for now the question of their ultimatemetaphysical connection.5 [notes.html#introfn5]Continuing forward on that basis, let us turn to a second area of contemporaryscientific research: dream recall.6 [notes.html#introfn6] Beginning in themid-twentieth century, almost all researchers assumed that the activated sleepphases of REM/PS are the only time that people dream (hence another, lessfrequently used term, “D-Sleep”). Initial data from sleep laboratory researchshowed that people who were awakened right after a phase of REM sleep usuallyremembered a dream, whereas awakenings from times outside REM produced little orno dream recall. Later research muddied the picture somewhat, with evidence thatREM is not always accompanied by the recall of a dream, and dreamlike mentalactivity may be recalled from many other stages of sleep besides REM, especiallyfrom NREM stage 2 toward the end of the sleep cycle. Current estimates putrecall from REM awakenings at 80 percent and recall from NREM awakenings at 43percent. Much controversy remains on this subject, partly because the “REM =dreaming” equation offers such an appealingly simple explanation for dreams, andsome researchers are reluctant to adjust past theories to new realities. Atpresent, the best we can say is that REM is a trigger for dreaming. It isapparently the part of the sleep cycle most reliably connected to dream recall,even though the human brain-mind system seems to be dreaming in some way orother throughout the sleep cycle.An inevitable question arises: Do animals dream? We currently have no means ofproving it one way or the other, just as we have no way to determine whetherhuman fetuses and newborns are genuinely dreaming before they develop theability to speak and relate their experiences. Some researchers have argued thatdreaming, as distinct from PS, requires high-level cognitive and linguisticabilities that only arise in humans after the ages of three to five. That seemsunlikely to me. In all known species, PS involves a lively interaction betweenthe brain stem and the forebrain. If we accept the evidence from research onhumans showing that a PS-activated forebrain is crucial to the formation ofdreams, it is reasonable to assume that other species who undergo this sameneural process during sleep are indeed dreaming, albeit in a cognitive modeappropriate to their brain-mind systems. The dreams of nonhuman animals arelikely to reflect the primary instinctual abilities and desires of eachparticular species. We certainly see this in research on cats. When their brainsare surgically altered so they enter PS without relaxing their muscles, catsapparently act out their dreams by energetic physical activities includingrunning, climbing, attacking imaginary foes, and mating. Additional evidencecomes from research on rats showing that the same brain activation patternsgenerated during a survival-related learning task while awake (e.g., seekingfood on a circular track) were repeated during the subsequent sleep cycle.According to the definition of dreaming I have proposed, it is fair to assumethat these rats are indeed dreaming of important activities that occurred duringthe previous waking state. What experiential form their dreams might take, wecannot say. We do not know which of their brain-mind processes are involved, nordo we know what other topics they might be dreaming about besides running aroundin human experiments. We know enough, however, to recognize and affirm anauthentic dreaming potential in animal species other than our own.7[notes.html#introfn7]Returning to the case of Homo sapiens, it turns out that we actually rememberonly a tiny fraction of all that happens during the sleep cycle. Our brains passthrough several cycles of intense activation every time we go to sleep, cyclesthat are strongly and consistently associated with dreaming. Yet once we awaken,we apparently forget the vast majority of those dream experiences. This is apoint worth keeping in mind, because it suggests that the functions of dreamingmay not depend on conscious recollection and may in fact operate unconsciously,outside the sphere of ordinary waking awareness.That said, people do spontaneously remember some of their dreams. The averageamong contemporary North Americans and Western Europeans (the main populationson whom research has been conducted) is a recall rate of one or two dreams perweek, although, as mentioned earlier, some people report much more than that(two or three per night), and other people report never remembering any dreamsat all. Most people say their recall rate fluctuates depending on the conditionsof awakening (whether abrupt or gradual), the presence or absence of waking lifestress, and the intensity or bizarreness of the dreams themselves. The massiveneurochemical shift in brain functioning from sleeping to waking may be anotherfactor, particularly in light of the relative deactivation of short-term memorysystems in PS, which makes it very difficult for anything experienced in sleepto be remembered later in the waking state. Nevertheless, some dreams do manageto survive the neurochemical transition from sleeping to waking and impressthemselves on people’s awareness. Dream recall as a general phenomenon seems tobe a sturdy feature of normal human psychology, occurring at more or less thesame frequency across the demographic board. People with personalitiescharacterized as “open to experience” and “tolerant of ambiguity” have somewhathigher dream recall than people of other personality types, but the differenceisn’t huge. Young adults remember dreams a bit more frequently than older adultsdo, and women tend to recall more dreams than men do, but again the differencesare not as significant as the baseline similarities. To remember a small butsignificant number of dreams is a normal feature of life for most human beings.An intriguing discovery in this area is that the most influential factordistinguishing low and high recallers is their attitude toward dreaming.8[notes.html#introfn8] People who have a positive attitude toward dreamsgenerally have a higher rate of recall than people who have a negative attitudeabout dreaming. At first sight this is not surprising—if you believe that dreamshave meaning and value, you are more likely to remember them than if you believethey are totally random and worthless. Simple methods of promoting a morepositive attitude about dreams have been found to lead to a dramatic increase indream recall. Whether one should have a positive attitude toward dreams is aseparate issue; the key insight of research in this area is that dream recall isresponsive to waking stimulation. When people are encouraged to pay moreattention to their dreams, their dream recall usually goes up. This connectionbetween waking attitude and recall rates is significant for our project,because, as we shall see, all religious traditions have actively sought toinfluence people’s attitudes toward their dreams.It should also be noted that dream content is very difficult to influence orcontrol in an absolute fashion. Numerous investigations have tried, and largelyfailed, to alter dream content by means of stimulation before sleep (e.g.,watching an emotionally arousing movie) or during sleep (e.g., ringing a buzzerby the sleeping person’s ear).9 [notes.html#introfn9] Some of the followingdreams do indeed incorporate the external stimulations, but many of them do not,and those that do are often distorted in strange, unpredictable ways. The dreamformation process is stubbornly independent of external control; it has its ownpurposes that usually relate to, yet are autonomous from, the intentions of thewaking world. Even in dreams with a lucid or metacognitive quality ofself-awareness, the power of conscious volition is generally quite limited, andthe unfolding of the dream continues to produce surprising, unconsciouslycreated experience.Now to the third research topic, the study of continuous and bizarre factors indreaming. As just mentioned, some spontaneously remembered dreams attract wakingattention precisely because of their intensity and strange deviation fromordinary life. But systematic investigation of dream content has shown that mostdreams are fairly mundane and realistic, involving roughly accurate portrayalsof the day-to-day realities of the dreamer’s life.10 [notes.html#introfn10] Thecontinuity between waking and dreaming is strongest regarding personalrelationships. The people with whom you are closest —your husband or wife,boyfriend or girlfriend, parents, siblings, friends, workmates—are very likelyto be the people who appear most frequently in your dreams. Indeed, frequency ofdream appearance can be taken as a reliable indicator of personal intimacy, somuch so that if you read a person’s dreams “blindly,” without knowing anythingabout his or her waking life, you can accurately predict the most importantrelationships in that person’s life, along with the emotional tenor of thoserelationships.11 [notes.html#introfn11]This points to another dimension of dreaming-waking continuity, involving aperson’s emotional concerns and attitudes. The clearest evidence comes fromwaking life situations that produce negative emotions, such as an abuse victim’sfear of a cruel spouse, an employee’s anger at a disrespectful boss, or achild’s sadness at the death of a parent. In all such cases, people’s dreamsconsistently portray the exact same emotions that predominate in their wakinglives. The same thing happens in positive circumstances (e.g., an athlete’s joyin victory, a lover’s desire for his or her beloved), when the happy emotions inwaking life are reflected in dreams with positive affect. In recognition of thisfeature, dreaming has been compared to an emotional thermostat, and the analogyis apt.12 [notes.html#introfn12] Dreams accurately represent whatever is mostemotionally urgent and engaging in a person’s waking life, with particularsensitivity toward the negative end of the affective spectrum.At the same time, many dream elements are discontinuous with waking life. Somedreams—not all, but some—display a seemingly infinite capacity for creativefantasy. Researchers have distinguished several different kinds of dreambizarreness, including character metamorphoses, physical distortions, suddenshifts of setting, unrealistic juxtapositions of places and activities,improbable or impossible occurrences, supernatural abilities, and inexplicablebehavior. A general neuroscientific theory has been developed by contemporaryresearchers to account for such oddities.13 [notes.html#introfn13] According tothis line of thinking, the diminished activity in the brain’s executive centerduring PS makes it difficult for the sleeping mind to pay attention, thinkrationally, or make intentional decisions while dreaming, leaving the individualcognitively defenseless against random neural firings from the brain stem. Thisprecipitous decline in executive center functioning, combined with the jarringeffects of PGO spikes and the hallucinatory effects of changes in brainchemistry, produces the characteristic cognitive deficits we see in bizarredreams.Such a theory has some merit and should be taken seriously, but it leaves muchof actual dream experience unaccounted for. What about all the accuratecontinuities with waking life we’ve just been discussing? Whatever may or maynot be happening in the brain during sleep, the processes of dream formation arecertainly capable of portraying stable, coherent, realistic scenarios throughoutthe sleep cycle. What about dreams in which the dreamer regains (or develops newforms of) “higher” cognitive abilities for selective attention, reflectivethought, intentional action, and self-awareness?14 [notes.html#introfn14] Thisalone suggests that humans experience a far greater range of complex andsophisticated brain-mind activity in dreaming than is recognized by mainstreamneuroscience. What about recurrent, pan-human patterns in dream content? We knowof several distinctive types of dream that are consistently reported from a widevariety of demographic sources. Such recurrent dream patterns, virtuallyuniversal in our species, are poorly explained by theories emphasizing therandom, disorderly, and nonsensical aspects of dreaming.The bottom line is this: bizarreness in dreaming should not be conceptualizedsolely in terms of its failures compared to the cognitive attributes of an alertwaking state. The bizarre and discontinuous elements in dreams may also beunderstood as the natural expression of alternative modes of brain-mindfunctioning, modes that are different from, but not necessarily inferior to,waking consciousness. Dreaming characters, places, and activities are connectednot by reference to objective waking reality but by far-reaching networks ofemotional, conceptual, and imagistic associations. A frightening storm in adream may not refer to meteorological events in waking life but rather to aperson’s inner sense of emotional upheaval. An attractive red sports car may notrelate to any actual vehicle but to an otherwise inchoate desire for speed,vigor, and youth. The meaningful continuities between dream content and wakinglife are still there but are expressed in metaphorical rather than literalterms. Ironically, interpretive research on dream symbols and metaphors receivesunwitting support from neuroscience, particularly its findings that paradoxicalsleep is a time of heightened activation of the association cortex and thesecondary visual system responsible for generating internal imagery. This makesgood sense in light of interpretive approaches that see in dreams a dramaticexpansion of a person’s associational creativity, with a special emphasis onvisual symbolism and embodied experience. From this perspective, at least someof the bizarre elements of dreaming can be understood as expressions of adifferent kind of intelligence whose natural language consists primarily ofimage, metaphor, and allegory.The last area of sleep and dream research to consider before moving aheadregards prototypical patterns of dream content. As just mentioned, certain typesof dreams have been found to recur with great regularity in human sleepingexperience (e.g., dreams of flying, falling, being chased or attacked, meeting adead relative, having sex, etc.). Scientific researchers have long recognizedsuch dreams, but to date no consensus has been reached on how best to map theirphenomenology. Several different classification schemes have been developed,using terms like “type dreams,” “big dreams,” “culture pattern dreams,”“intensified dreams,” “impactful dreams,” “highly significant dreams,”“extraordinary dreams,” and “apex dreaming.”15 [notes.html#introfn15] The mainobstacle for all these theories is that dreams, being dreams, are endlesslyvariable in their form and content. Any proposed classification systeminevitably stumbles over examples that have mixed features from severalcategories or that do not fit in any category at all. It must be admitted, then,that research in this area is very much a work in progress. Nevertheless, thefindings so far give us a decent picture of several distinct forms of dreamingexperience, and this is extremely useful information for the purpose of thisbook. The general term I use, prototypical dreaming, is intended to refer tovivid, highly memorable patterns of dream content that recur in the sleepexperiences of people from many different backgrounds. Prototypical dreams arenot universal in the sense that every single person experiences them all.Rather, they are latent forms of dreaming potential. They reflect innatepredispositions to dream in certain ways that, when actualized, make unusuallystrong impressions on waking awareness. In contrast to the vast majority ofsleep experiences that fade into oblivion, prototypical dreams are actuallyquite easy to remember. Some of them are literally impossible to forget,remaining a vivid presence in people’s memories for the rest of their lives.In the following ten chapters, I argue that prototypical dreams have played acreative role in virtually all the world’s religious and spiritual traditions.The consciousness-provoking impact of dreaming has not been sufficientlyrecognized by scientists or religious studies scholars, and my hope is that thisbook will present a compelling case for taking dream experiences more fully intoaccount in the comparative study of religion."},{"pageContent":"1HINDUISMHave you ever had a dream so realistic that when you woke up you weren’t surefor a moment if you were actually awake or still dreaming? Have you ever wokenup from a dream only to discover (after you’ve awakened for “real”) that youwere still asleep and dreaming? Vivid yet confusing experiences like these grabour attention because they disrupt ordinary assumptions about the line thatseparates dreams from the waking world. Many people think of waking and dreamingas polar opposites, as synonymous with real and unreal, objective truth versussubjective fantasy. But this kind of sharp distinction is not a psychologicalgiven. Humans are not born with a predetermined concept of what happens when wedream. Our ideas about dreaming emerge over time as we grow older, gainexperience of the world, and develop new cognitive abilities. Westernpsychologists have postulated a regular, universal series of conceptual stagesin children’s understanding of the nature of dreams.1 [notes.html#ch01fn1] Thisresearch indicates that very young children tend to believe that dreams are realmaterial events occurring outside their bodies and are perceptible by otherpeople. As they become older and develop greater cognitive maturity, childrenand their beliefs usually change so that dreams are understood as internal,nonmaterial images that only the dreamer can witness. Depending on the culturaland religious traditions in which the children are raised, a furtherdevelopmental stage may be reached whereby they come to believe that most dreamsare immaterial and internal to the individual but that at least some dreams arecaused by external sources (God, ancestral spirits, demons, etc.), possessed ofan authentic reality, and meaningful to both self and others. Whether this thirdstage should be considered an advance or a regression depends on yourmetaphysical point of view.Whatever views you hold, you are likely to find them reflected somewhere in themultifaceted religious traditions of Hinduism. From its earliest sacred textsand rituals to its modern teachings and practices, Hinduism has much to sayabout the relationship between waking, dreaming, and reality. What kind(s) ofreality do we experience in dreaming? How do those realities relate to wakinglife? Do experiences in dreams enable us to gain any kind of legitimateknowledge? How can we know if our waking reality right now is indeed real, andnot a deceptive dream? I’m going to refer to these issues collectively as theontological question of dreaming. For those of us influenced by the Westernphilosophical assumption that waking reality is reality and no other conditionmerits that term, the Hindu tradition offers an especially good introduction tothe possibility that other authentic dimensions of reality may be disclosed inthe natural cycles of sleeping and dreaming.THE VEDASThe Indus River flows for nearly two thousand miles from north to south throughthe South Asian subcontinent, drawing its original waters from the snowmelt ofthe Himalaya Mountains. As the Indus makes its way to the Arabian Sea, it isfurther swollen by the abundant rainfall of the area’s tropical climate, leadingto fairly predictable patterns of seasonal storming and flooding. The earliesthuman settlements found along the Indus date back to the seventh millennium BCE.The rich soil of the Indus flood plain proved very hospitable to agriculturalfood production and thus to the development of increasingly populous and complexurban societies. Over time, several hundred towns and a few large cities arose,with common systems of language, measurement, and trading practice. By the thirdmillennium BCE these people (known as the Dravidians, after their major languagegroup) were at the height of their prosperity. Archeological evidence indicatesthat their civilization included various collective and private religiousceremonies. Most of the worship was directed at goddess figures responsible forfertility, crop growth, and the cycles of nature. Numerous terra-cotta statuesand temple sculptures portray images of voluptuous divine females, along with avariety of other animals and mythical creatures.Sometime after 2000 BCE a new group of people moved into the Indus River region.They were nomads from Central Asia who herded cattle and horses, and who broughttheir own complex social, cultural, and religious practices into contact withthe agricultural traditions of the Dravidians. The newcomers (known as theIndo-Aryans) quickly established, by means both peaceful and violent, a vibrantnew religious orientation for the people of the Indus River region. This newfaith centered on ancient collections of knowledge (Vedas) that were orallytransmitted through the generations, recited in poetic verses (mantras) whosespiritual potency emanated from the sacred sound (brahman) of the wordsthemselves. Many of the Vedas revolved around a dramatic myth in which the worldwas created from the dismembered body of a cosmic man. An act of supremeself-sacrifice brought humans into being, and it is thus the responsibility ofhumans to sustain the created world by continuously repeating that primordialsacrifice. This emphasis on proper ritual practice as the essential safeguardfor collective well-being naturally gave the Vedic priests (Brahmans, those whorecite the verses) a great deal of power in society, and, over time, the Vedascame to include teachings governing all aspects of human life.Between 1200 and 900 BCE, major compilations of the Vedas were written down, theforemost of which was the Rig Veda.2 [notes.html#ch01fn2] With more than onethousand hymns devoted to a colorful multitude of gods and goddesses, the RigVeda is more of a religious encyclopedia than a doctrinal statement, filled withmultiple and sometimes conflicting perspectives on a vast array of topics. Manyof its verses provide spells and incantations to help people with the practicalconcerns of their daily lives. Avoiding physical danger, protecting loved ones,gaining wealth and status, satisfying romantic desires, defeating enemies,insuring good weather and harvests—these are the immediate goals of ritualpractice. The mundane, this-worldly focus of so much of the Rig Veda highlightsthe close connection in early Hindu tradition between transcendent religiouspower and the earthly challenges of human survival.Only a handful of verses in the Rig Veda mention sleep or dreams, usually in anegative tone. This suggests that the Vedic priests did not take much interestin these phenomena. One of the few exceptions is the following prayer to Agni,the god of fire, to protect pregnant women and their fetuses:Let Agni the killer of demons unite with this prayer and expel from here the onewhose name is evil, who lies with disease upon your embryo, your womb.The one whose name is evil, who lies with disease upon your embryo, your womb,the flesh-eater—Agni has driven him away with prayer.The one who kills the embryo as it settles, as it rests, as it stirs, who wishesto kill it when it is born—we will drive him away from here.The one who spreads apart your two thighs, who lies between the married pair,who licks the inside of your womb—we will drive him away from here. The one whoby changing into your brother, or your husband, or your lover lies with you, whowishes to kill your offspring—we will drive him away from here.The one who bewitches you with sleep or darkness and lies with you—we will drivehim away from here.The hymn addressed a very real source of danger to the Hindu people of thattime, and indeed to all people at all times. Human pregnancy has always beenfilled with potentially fatal threats for the unborn fetus and gravid mother.Even in the era of modern Western medicine, pregnancy remains a perilous,unpredictable process. This Vedic verse is aimed at protecting the fetus fromthose perennial dangers that may occur during any of the three stages ofpregnancy (settling, resting, stirring). Agni is an appropriate god to ask forsuch help, as the element of fire brings light to the darkness, banishing demonsand foiling their malevolent plans.A notable shift of subject occurs in the second half of the hymn, when the focusof concern moves from the fetus to the mother. The demons threaten the fetuswith death, but they are threatening the woman with something rather different:sexual desire. The demons are said to have the power of deceptively changingtheir appearance in order to ravish the unsuspecting woman, and they may takeforms that are socially legitimate (one’s husband), or incestuous and immoral(one’s brother), or stimulating and pleasurable (one’s lover). In all cases, thedemons take sexual advantage of the woman’s helplessness while “bewitched” withsleep and darkness. Taken together, these qualities—sexual arousal,shape-shifting characters, loss of self-awareness and control, occurrence duringsleep—lead to the conclusion that the demonic attacks described in this ancientVedic verse are a kind of dreaming experience. It is not clear in the hymnwhether the seduction is the cause of the fetus’s death, that is, whether thedemons kill the fetus by having dream sex with the mother. More likely is thatthe two parts of the hymn are not connected in such a literal fashion but areboth expressing a common concern about threats to orderly human reproduction.From the perspective of social and religious authorities like the Brahmans,promoting healthy pregnancies and controlling female sexuality were crucialfactors in the cause of establishing a stable, caste-based community with clearlines of familial descent. Such a community could not thrive if fetuses diedbefore birth or if female sexuality was overly stimulated (opening the door tothe socially disruptive problems of illegitimate births and questionablepaternity). The possibility that sexual dreams might actually be pleasurable forthe woman, for example, in dreams of one’s husband or lover, was irrelevant.What mattered to the Brahmans was maintaining the proper order of human-divinerelations. Discouraging women’s sexual dreaming was a small but necessary partof that process.Such a hymn was recited as a means of fending off bad dreams. Another hymn fromthe Rig Veda was intended to cast a spell of sleep over others. It was firstused, according to some sources, by the sage Vasistha when he traveled in adream to the house of the sky god, Varuna. As Vasistha entered Varuna’s house awatchdog attacked him, and the sage spoke these verses to make him stop hisfrantic barking:White and tawny son of Sarama [the ancestor of dogs], when you bare your teeththey gleam like spears in your snapping jaws. Fall fast asleep! …Let the mother sleep; let the father sleep; let the dog sleep; let the master ofthe house sleep. Let all the kinsmen sleep; let our people all around sleep.Later generations of Hindus have used these verses as bedtime lullabies fortheir children. Related to this hymn is another one describing Varuna’s angerwhen he discovers Vasistha in his home. The sage prays for the god’s forgivenessand offers this explanation of his actions: “The mischief was not done by ownfree will, Varuna; wine, anger, dice, or carelessness led me astray. The oldershares in the mistake of the younger. Even sleep does not avert evil.” This lastline is intriguing, as it expresses one of the Vedic responses to theontological question of dreaming. If dreams can be said to have any kind ofreality, it is a moral reality, a reality as a fearful arena of darkness,deceit, and temptation. The same evil forces that threaten people in waking lifealso threaten them in dreams. Indeed, the loss of vigilance in sleep makespeople even more vulnerable to those malevolent powers. Vasistha is quick toemphasize the external nature of the evils that haunt our sleep (whichconveniently absolves him of personal blame for his dreaming misbehavior). Theearlier hymn about pregnancy also portrayed bad dreams as external assaultsduring sleep, and this seems to reflect a broader Vedic understanding. In thefollowing verses, a prayer to a god known as the “Master of Thought,” the RigVeda takes the notion of the externality of bad dreams to a logical, andvengeful, conclusion.If we have done something bad on purpose or not on purpose, or with the wrongpurpose, awake or asleep, let Agni place far away from us all these misdeedsthat are displeasing.We have conquered today, and we have won; we have become free of sin. The wakingdream, the evil intent—let it fall upon the one we hate; let it fall upon theone who hates us.The proper prayers and rituals not only protect us from bad dreams, but they canalso redirect those dreams against our enemies. With this view of dreams asexternal missiles of evil, there is no reason to pay any attention to thecontent of dreams. No interpretation is necessary because no meanings are beingconveyed. Dreams have no value as sources of information or knowledge; they mayhave moral reality, but they lack epistemological reality. Another prayer toVaruna for protection from various threats includes the following verse: “Ifsomeone I have met, O king, or a friend has spoken of danger to me in a dream tofrighten me, or if a thief should waylay us, or a wolf—protect us from that,Varuna.” Nightmares are grouped with thieves and wolves as frightening threatsto which humans are perennially vulnerable. What is striking is that even if adream involves a friend who is warning you of danger, the content is stillinsignificant. It is not taken seriously as a real warning. According to thistext, the frightening emotion of the dream trumps all content, proving thedream’s demonic origin and epistemological emptiness.A different set of early Vedic collections, the Atharva Veda, includes severalspells to ward off bad dreams and manipulate the sleep of others. One of thesespells offers insight into the mythic origin of sleep itself:You who are neither alive nor dead, you are the immortal child of the gods, OSleep! Varunani is your mother, Yama [god of the dead] is your father, Araru isyour name.We know, O Sleep, of your birth, that you are the son of the divine women-folk,the instrument of Yama! You are the ender, you are death! Thus do we know you, OSleep; Please, O Sleep, protect us from evil dreams!As one pays off a sixteenth, an eighth, or an entire debt, thus do we transferevery evil dream upon our enemy.The final verse repeats the idea found in the Rig Veda that bad dreams can beaimed with almost mathematical precision at our waking-life foes. The priorverses offer praise to sleep as a true god, born of death and the “divinewomen-folk.” The close connection between sleep and death is a recurrent themein the Vedas, as it is in many other religious traditions. Dwelling between andbeyond the opposition of life and death, the deity Sleep is believed to have thepower of fending off nightmares and protecting people during the vulnerablehours of their slumber.Unlike the Rig Veda, the Atharva Veda gives a more detailed view of what earlyHindus actually did dream, beyond what they were trying not to dream.3[notes.html#ch01fn3] Even though the Rig Veda discourages people from payingattention to the content of their dreams, the Atharva Veda recognizes thatpeople still do have dreams and are naturally curious to know what they mean.Thus the Atharva Veda includes a chapter on the interpretation of particulartypes of dreaming, with a lengthy catalog of images and their significance. Theinterpretations are framed by a Vedic teaching that human character can takethree different temperamental forms (bilious/fiery, phlegmatic/watery, andsanguine/windy) which generate corresponding types of dreaming. Thus a fieryperson will tend to have dreams of arid land and burning objects, a wateryperson will dream of cool rivers and flourishing life, and a windy person willdream of moving clouds and running animals. A strong continuity between wakingand dreaming is implied in this text, with two practical implications forwould-be interpreters. First, pay close attention to the waking lifecircumstances of the dream (e.g., what time of night it occurred). Second, lookfor symbols in dreams that may relate to physical disturbances within theindividual’s body. Dreams may serve as a kind of early warning system formedical practitioners, providing an accurate diagnostic reflection of internalpsychosomatic processes.This medical interest in dream interpretation reveals an important strand ofearly Hinduism that was more favorably inclined toward the value of dreaming,particularly its prophetic power to anticipate the future. The dreams listed inthe Atharva Veda are divided into two categories—auspicious (subha) andinauspicious (asubha)—that foretell either prosperity or misfortune. Many of theinterpretive connections seem relatively clear and direct (for example, a dreamof teeth falling out means one is going to die), whereas others are much less so(a dream of one’s head being cut off means one is going to have a long life).Although the gods are mentioned as a source of some auspicious dreams, dreamingis generally presented in this text as a natural human experience, with multipledimensions of relevance to the individual’s personality and life circumstances.Dreams provide accurate expressions of people’s fears and desires, and, ifproperly interpreted, may be used as a valid source of knowledge and wakingaction. Remembering one’s dreams is crucial to benefiting from them (it is saida forgotten dream will not bear fruit), and authoritative guides like theAtharva Veda are aimed at helping people discern the potential significance oftheir dreams for their future health and well-being.This kind of dream symbol compendium is a classic instance of the “dream book”genre of writing found in cultures all over the world. As long as humans havebeen writing, they have been writing about dreams—recording them, categorizingthem, and trying to identify general principles by which to interpret them. Manyother examples are discussed in the chapters to come.FICTION AND REALITYWe should pause to consider once again a methodological question raised in theprologue. Taking the Vedas as our first example, how do we know if any of thisrelates to what Hindu people were actually dreaming during these periods oftime? We cannot be sure if the Vedic writers were describing what people trulydreamed or, rather, what they believed other people dreamed. What, then, can welearn about dreams from the partly or entirely fictionalized accounts of ancientreligious texts?One of the many inconvenient facts of dream research is that the only directsource of information we have about the subject is our own personal experience.Everything else we know about dreaming comes from indirect observation and otherpeople’s self-reports. That means we are always dealing with varying degrees ofuncertainty when studying the phenomenology of dreams. Indeed, even theseemingly direct insights we gain from our own dream experiences arequestionable, as a century of psychoanalysis has taught us. Faced with so manyambiguities, the temptation is to abandon any serious effort to study dreaming.In my view, that would be intellectual cowardice. Failure to achieve 100 percentcertainty does not preclude an ability to develop a high degree of confidenceabout important features of dreaming, based on the widest range of availableevidence. Our primary research question should be this: Do religious dreamreports plausibly reflect actual dimensions of human dreaming experience? Ratherthan asking whether any particular woman in ancient India dreamed of a demonlicking the inside of her womb, we ask whether it is plausible for women in thatpersonal, cultural, physiological, and spiritual context to experience the kindsof troubling sexual dreams attributed to them in the Vedas.The goal here is not to establish the historical factuality of particular dreamsbut rather to illuminate the full range of human dreaming potential. Such anapproach is strengthened by the comparison of dream reports across religioustraditions, enabling us to highlight the most prominent themes, motifs, andpatterns that recur in the greatest variety of contexts (thereby reducing thelikelihood of being misled by single cases). The ultimate aim, I propose, is tobuild up a broad empirical understanding of the most robust patterns of dreamingform and content, reported by the widest variety of people, throughout historyand across different cultures.That said, a final word should be added in favor of open-minded attention toostensibly “fictional” dreams. Recall the discussions in the prologue about thecontinuity of dreaming and waking, and the positive influence of externalencouragement on dream recall. It is reasonable, according to the findings ofWestern dream science, to suppose that people who live in a culture wherereligious dream texts are widely known and venerated will be more likely to haveactual dreams that include the stories, characters, symbols, and themesportrayed in those prominent religious texts. Thus may “fictional” dreams beget“real” dreams. The lively two-way interaction between dreaming and culture mustalways be kept in mind as we move forward.BIRTH DREAMSContinuing with the theme of dreams in relation to pregnancy and birth, the JainDharma traditions of ancient India attributed the conception of their greatestsage to a heaven-sent dream experienced by his mother. The Jains of present-dayIndia do not consider themselves “Hindu,” and they trace their lineage topre-Vedic times. In contrast to the Vedic focus on rituals of sacrifice, theJains have always emphasized nonviolence and compassion toward all life (thoughwith a rigorously ascetic, warlike approach to the control of one’s own bodilydesires). The Kalpa Sutra, a popular Jainist text compiled sometime in the earlysixth century CE, tells of the birth of Mahavira (599–527 BCE), a sage whoreached the enlightened stage of becoming a Tirthankar, a “bridge builder”across the river of human suffering.4 [notes.html#ch01fn4] On the night when theembryo of Mahavira took form in his mother Devananda’s womb, she entered “astate between sleeping and waking” and saw “fourteen illustrious, beautiful,lucky, blessed, auspicious, fortunate great dreams.” The fourteen dreams were,in order, an enormous elephant, a white bull, a handsome lion, the anointing ofthe goddess Sri, a garland of fresh flowers, a full white moon, a radiant redsun, a colorful flag, a vase full of gold, a lotus lake with water lilies, anocean with a great vortex of water, a celestial abode with glorious gardens anddecorations, an enormous pile of jewels, and a blazing, crackling fire. WhenDevananda awoke, she felt “glad, pleased, and joyful” at what she had seen. Shetold her husband, the King Siddhartha, who “firmly fixed the dreams in his mind,and entered upon considering them; he grasped the meaning of those dreams withhis own native intelligence and intuition, which were preceded by reflection.”Following this process of private exegesis, the king told his wife that thedreams were a prophetic message that she was going to bear a son who would oneday become a great king. According to the Kalpa Sutra, Devananda happilyreturned to her bedroom, saying to herself, “These my excellent and pre-eminentdreams shall not be counteracted by other bad dreams.” She resolved to “remainawake to save [my] dreams by means of [hearing] good, auspicious, pious,agreeable stories about gods and religious men.”King Siddhartha, meanwhile, desired additional interpretive help, and he senthis servants into town to “call the interpreters of dreams who well know thescience of prognostics with its eight branches, and are well versed in manysciences besides!” The interpreters arrived, dream books in hand, and when theyheard the king recite Devananda’s dreams they replied that their books containeddetailed descriptions of two broad classes of dreams, common and great. AllDevananda’s dreams were identified as great dreams, and the interpreters saidthat these particular fourteen great dreams were a collective sign that theembryo of a being known as a universal monarch (Arhat) had entered the mother’swomb. The interpreters went on to explain that a woman who has any seven ofthese fourteen great dreams will bear a Vasudeva, a lesser deity; with any fourof the great dreams, the woman will bear a Baladeva (still lesser), and a singlegreat dream of these fourteen will signal the conception of a Mandalika (leastdivine of all). Delighted by all this, the king “honored the interpreters ofdreams with praise and plenty of food, flowers, perfumes, garlands, andornaments” and then sent them on their way.This magical story of Mahavira’s birth takes the traditional dreaming-pregnancyconnection in a supremely favorable direction. Although bad dreams may signaldanger to a pregnant woman, good dreams hold the promise of indicating the verymoment of conception, along with a prediction of the child’s glorious future.This notion of dreaming as a source of prophetic knowledge is a remarkablywidespread religious belief, and we will have many chances to explore it inother contexts. In the Kalpa Sutra, the prophetic meaning of Devananda’s dreamsis confirmed by multiple sources. The dreams themselves are uniformly positivein their images of beauty, vitality, harmony, and power. Devananda’s emotionalreaction upon awakening is happy, as is her reaction to her husband’s carefullyconsidered interpretation. His reading is further supported by the collectivewisdom of the professional interpreters and their time-honored dream books. Allin all, the Kalpa Sutra provides many reasons to believe that dreams have thepotential to reveal future developments in waking life. The reference to a classof interpretive specialists with their own technical literature is worthremembering, as is the typological distinction between common dreams and greatdreams. Experiencing dreams, remembering them, thinking about their content,sharing them with family members, classifying them, seeking the help ofprofessional interpreters, all with an eye toward their potentially propheticmeanings—the world of the Kalpa Sutra presents these as normal, recognizablefeatures of human life. The stylized extravagance and lavish hyperbole ofDevananda’s dreams may make us question whether they really occurred in exactlythis way, but her story nevertheless provides us with a valuable window onto theinterplay of dreaming belief, practice, and experience among the Jain audiencesof the Kalpa Sutra.THE UPANISHADSA different strand of Hindu religious reflection led away from the Vedas to amystical quest for altered consciousness. In contrast to the Vedic focus onthis-worldly fears and desires, a group of poet-philosophers radicallyreinterpreted the rituals of Hindu tradition, shifting the focus inward toward asacrifice of the self in search of progressively deeper realizations of one’sidentity with ultimate reality. Starting around 700 BCE and continuing for thenext several centuries, new religious texts were written that explored thesemystical connections (upanishads) between ritual practice and spiritualdiscovery, prompting new interest in self-exploration by means of breathing,meditation, yoga, and dreaming. Several Upanishadic texts devoted carefulattention to the spiritual qualities of sleep and dreaming, and on the wholethese writings mark a dramatic reversal of the earlier Vedic antipathy towarddreams.The Chandogya Upanishad included a special ritual for those cases in which “aman is striving to achieve greatness.”5 [notes.html#ch01fn5] Dream incubation isthe general term used for pre-sleep practices aimed at eliciting a favorabledream, and the following passage offers a good illustration of its essentialelements. The greatness-seeking man is instructed to prepare a special mixtureof herbs, honey, and curd on the night of the full moon, to pour offerings ofghee into a fire while praising various gods, to drink the whole of the mixture,and finally to lie down behind the fire, “remaining silent and unresisting.”Although no guarantees are made that the ritual will necessarily work, the textgoes on to say that:If he sees a woman, he should know that his rite has been successful. In thisconnection, there is this verse:When a man sees a woman in his dreamsDuring a rite to obtain a wish;He should recognize its successIn that dream vision.Nothing more is said about why a dream of a woman should herald a man’s futuregreatness; the symbolic connection is simply assumed. Dream incubation ritualsin other religions are usually practiced in locations far removed from theordinary social world (e.g., a cave or graveyard), but here the fire itselfrepresents a sacred location, a spatial center around which the ritual proceeds.The timing with the full moon insures a harmony with celestial patterns, and thepotion is clearly intended as a kind of spiritual agent, though the exactingredients and effects remain obscure. The pre-sleep prayers chanted before thefire echo the hymn to Agni discussed earlier, suggesting at least one thread ofcontinuity between the Vedas and the Upanishads. For classical Hinduism, fire isthe patron element of sleepers and dreamers.The efficacy of rituals involving sleep and dreams led many of the Upanishadicpoets to experiment with various alterations of consciousness across thesleep-wake cycle. For example, the Kausitaki Upanishad encourages people toperform the internal fire sacrifice and breath meditation “without interruption,whether one is awake or asleep.”6 [notes.html#ch01fn6] While not directlydisputing the Vedic notion of sleep as a condition of danger, this Upanishadsuggests that sleep may also be a time for virtuous religious practice. Oncethat positive potential is affirmed, the whole realm of sleep and dreamingbecomes the subject of tremendous spiritual interest, as will be seen in thediscussion of modern Hindu teachers at the end of this chapter.Several Upanishads explore the existential dimensions of sleep experience inways that certainly strive to be empirically grounded in actual human life. Inthe Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, a dialogue between the sage Gargya and the kingAjatashatru turns to the figure of a sleeping man.7 [notes.html#ch01fn7]Ajatashatru calls to the man, but he remains asleep. The king then touches theman, and he awakens. Ajatashatru asks Gargya, “When this man was asleep here,where was the person consisting of perception? And from where did he return?” Ina reversal of the normal Upanishadic direction of knowledge transmission, it isthe king and not the sage who provides the answer:When this man was asleep here, the person consisting of perception, havinggathered the cognitive power of these vital functions [prana] into his owncognitive power, was resting in the space within the heart. When that persontakes hold of them, then the man is said to be asleep. During that time thebreath remains in the grasp of that person, as do speech, sight, hearing, andmind. Wherever he may travel in his dream, those regions become his worlds. Hemay appear to become a great king or an eminent Brahmin, or to visit the highestand the lowest regions. Just as a great king, taking his people with him, maymove around his domain at will, so he, taking the vital functions here with him,moves around his body at will.This remarkable passage represents one of the earliest psychophysiologicalanalyses of sleep and dreaming. According to Ajatashatru, falling asleepinvolves the in-gathering of vital functions from their waking engagement withthe external world, allowing the liberation of the self within the dreamingimagination. The nearly infinite potential of dream experience is emphasized,with its wishful impulses, grandiose fantasies, and extremities of vision. Thereis rather more attribution of agency and volition within the dream state than isusually recognized by Western psychologists, but this is consistent with thebroader Upanishadic theme of cultivating new modes of self-awareness extendingbeyond the simple opposition of waking and dreaming. The Brhadaranyaka Upanishadpassage continues with Ajatasutra describing the further condition of “deepdreamless sleep” in which the individual “rests there oblivious to everything,just as a young man, a great king, or an eminent Brahmin remains oblivious toeverything at the height of sexual bliss.” An intriguing analogy, and one thatlinks the Upanishadic discussion back to the Vedic interest in conception anddreaming.The most detailed and provocative Upanishadic passage comes a little later inthis same text, when the sage Yajnavalkya grants the king Janaka the freedom toask any question he wishes. The grateful king uses this wonderful boon to pose aprofound existential question: “What is the source of light for a person here?”Yajnavalkya replies that the self (atman) is a person’s true source of light,and in explaining the nature of atman the sage quickly delves into thephenomenology of sleep and dreaming:Now, this person has just two places—this world and the other world. And thereis a third, the place of dream [svapna] where the two meet. Standing there inthe place where the two meet, he sees both those places—this world and the otherworld. Now, that place serves as an entryway to the other world, and as he movesthrough that entryway he sees both the bad things and the joys.This is how he dreams. He takes materials from the entire world and, taking themapart on his own and then on his own putting them back together, he dreams withhis own radiance, with his own light. In that place this person becomes his ownlight. In that place there are no carriages, tandems, or roads; but he createsfor himself carriages, tandems, and roads. In that place there are no joys,pleasures, or delights; but he creates for himself joys, pleasures, anddelights. In that place there are no pools, ponds, or rivers; but he creates forhimself pools, ponds, and rivers—for he is a creator. On this subject, there arethese verses: “Subduing by sleep the bodily realm, / Remaining awake, hecontemplates the sleeping senses.”Although the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad is a religious text, it provides asurprisingly secular and naturalistic explanation for dream formation. True, thesage Yajnavalkya locates dreaming between the human and divine realms, in whichposition it serves as a medium for the transmission of knowledge from onedimension to the other. But dreaming itself is characterized as a natural,constructive, self-directed mental process. When a person goes to sleep his orher atman comes to life in the pure, free play of the imagination (the sameverb, srj, is used in the Upanishads to refer to dreaming, creating, speaking,imagining, and seminal emission).8 [notes.html#ch01fn8] Bits and pieces of thewaking world are used to build a whole new world of experience. The examples ofdream content mentioned (horse travel, positive emotions, bodies of water)reflected common physical conditions and personal experiences of ordinary humanlife, and the emphasis on the creative power of the dream-liberated atmanhighlighted the “mystical connection” between each person and the ultimatecreative power of the universe. Far from the externally aimed blasts ofmalevolence portrayed in the Vedas, dreams in this text are entirely internal,self-generating phenomena. This does not detract from their reality, however. Onthe contrary, dreams vividly display the true creative power of atman, and theyeven have the potential to disclose one’s vital relationship to the supremereality of the cosmos. This is why Yajnavalkya responded to the king’s questionabout atman by encouraging him to reflect on the nature of sleep and dreaming.Whether or not dreams have prophetic significance—this text is silent on thequestion—their value as a means of spiritual education and enlightenment isprofound.Yajnavalkya went on to consider the folk belief that people who are sound asleepshould not be awakened abruptly because their spirits are traveling and needtime to return safely to their bodies. Yajnavalkya compared that to another,contrary folk belief that “this place of his [the dreamer’s] is the same as theplace he is in when he is awake, because one sees in a dream the same things onesees when one is awake.” The earlier discussion of atman and self-creativity indreams would suggest Yajnavalkya favored the latter belief in dreaming-wakingcontinuity, but his initial response expanded on the travel/journey metaphor ofthe former: “It is like this. As a large fish moves between both banks, thenearer and the farther, so this person moves between both realms, the realm ofdream and the realm where one is awake.” This simple image highlighted thecyclical relationship between dreaming and waking, a relationship rooted in theever-shifting ebb and flow of natural life. The sense of vital movement betweenwaking and dreaming was not, however, intended to mislead people into thinkingtheir dreams constitute a “second reality.” Like other Upanishadic sages,Yajnavalkya’s ultimate interest was guiding people to a transcendent perspectiveon the whole of reality. Self-reflection on dream experience was offered as onemeans to achieve that:Now when people appear [in dreams] to kill or vanquish him, when an elephantappears to chase him, or when he appears to fall into a pit, he is onlyignorantly imagining dangers that he had seen while he was awake. But when he,appearing to be a god or a king, thinks “I alone am this world! I am all!”—thatis his highest world. Now, this is the aspect of his that is beyond what appearsto be good, freed from what is bad, and without fear. It is like this. As a manembraced by a woman he loves is oblivious to everything within or without, sothis person embraced by the self [atman] consisting of knowledge is oblivious toeverything within and without. Clearly, this is the aspect of his where alldesires are fulfilled, where the self is the only desire, and which is free fromdesires and free from sorrows. Here a father is not a father, a mother is not amother, worlds are not worlds, gods are not gods, and Vedas are not Vedas. Herea thief is not a thief, an abortionist is not an abortionist, an outcaste is notan outcaste, a pariah is not a pariah, a recluse is not a recluse, and anascetic is not an ascetic. Neither the good nor the bad follow him, for he hasnow passed beyond all sorrows of the heart.The examples of frightening, deceptively “real” dreams Yajnavalkyamentioned—falling, being chased by an animal, being attacked by other people—arealso cited by Western psychologists as especially common types of nightmarishdreaming.9 [notes.html#ch01fn9] Such dreams may be intensely vivid andemotionally arousing, but Yajnavalkya warned against taking them too seriously.Most important was to strive for the realization within the dream of theself-created nature of all reality. The sage urged his listeners to reflect onthe radical freedom of social identity, religious authority, and moral behaviorthey experience in their dreams, as a means of recognizing each person’spotential for spiritual growth and self-transcendence. No matter how vibrantthings appear in the waking world or in dreams, the truth of atman leads beyondall creative illusions to the original creative source of the cosmos itself.This was the basis for an Upanishadic categorization of four fundamental statesof being, expressed rather cryptically in the Mandukya Upanishad as waking,dreaming, deep dreamless sleep, and self-realization [turiya, literally “thefourth”].10 [notes.html#ch01fn10] The last of the four was described as “unseen,ungraspable, unthinkable, indescribable, beyond the reach of ordinarytransaction,” all of which befits a state in which the atman is finally releasedfrom all worldly attachments and perceives its own pure, authentic nature.Hinduism has no official, canonical text comparable to the Qur’an of Islam, theNovum Testamentum of Christianity, or the Torah of Judaism. Nevertheless, theVedas and Upanishads have provided the primary foundation for Hindu beliefs,practices, and experiences throughout the following centuries. As we have nowseen, these age-old texts present a complex and thoughtful understanding of thekaleidoscopic nature of human dream experience. Indeed, many of theirobservations compare favorably with Western psychological research on dreaming.To summarize the main ideas discussed so far, the classic writings of Hinduismrecognize that cycles of sleep and dreaming are natural, healthy, pan-humanphenomena. They acknowledge the frightening, disturbing quality of frequentnightmares, and highlight the connections between dreaming, sex, and conception,as well as between dreaming, illness, and death. They describe at length theways in which some dreams involve bizarre metamorphoses of character, others theflagrant violation of moral law, and still others the surprising awareness thatone is dreaming. The specific details of dream content are attributed to thepersonal characteristics of the dreamer, and interpretation focuses on thediscernment of symbolic connections between dream imagery and important wakinglife concerns.All this is consistent with the theories and practices of mainstream Westerndream science. To be sure, modern researchers would likely disagree with theidea of external dream causation in the Vedas, along with any suggestion thatdreams can predict the future. But setting those notions aside for the moment,the remaining areas of agreement are large indeed, and they provideencouragement for the general project here of developing a phenomenology ofdreaming that integrates historical, cross-cultural, and contemporary researchfindings.The remainder of this chapter traces the Hindu engagement with dreaming inmythic literature and in nineteenth-and early-twentieth-century spiritualmovements.MYTHIC LITERATUREThe Vedas and Upanishads have enjoyed a high degree of philosophical authority,but the texts that have most deeply aroused the love and enthusiasm of the Hindupeople are mythic narratives like The Mahabharata and The Ramayana. Thesepopular tales were composed over a period of many centuries and recited orallyin ceremonial contexts. Both stories essentially revolve around an epic battleof good versus evil. An old king leaves the throne, a new king rises up, evilforces resist him, a climactic battle is fought, the villains lose, and thethrone is restored to its rightful heir. In this regard, The Mahabharata and TheRamayana continue the traditional Hindu concern with the relationship betweenhuman action and cosmic power, illustrating the idea of religious duty withcolorful stories about heroic efforts to overcome violent physical challenges.The two epics dramatize the existential opposition of chaos and order withvividly rendered characters whose feelings and actions movingly reflect people’sactual experiences with the fragility of life. Consistent with Vedic andUpanishadic teachings, the dreams of these characters accurately reflect theirpersonalities and truthfully anticipate their future prospects.For example, in The Mahabharata the Kuru leader Karna tells his divine friendKrishna about the dreams that he and other Kuru warriors are dreaming abouttheir enemies, the Pandavas, on the eve of the grand battle:Many horrible dreams are being seen by the Kurus, and many terrible signs andgruesome omens, predicting victory for the Pandavas. Meteors are falling fromthe sky, and there are hurricanes and earthquakes. The elephants are trumpeting,and horses are shedding tears and refusing food and water. Horses, elephants,and men are eating little, yet they are shitting prodigiously. … I had a dreamin which I saw all the Pandavas climb to a palace with a thousand pillars. Allof them wore white turbans and white robes. And in my dream I saw you, Krishna,drape entrails around the earth, which was awash with blood, and I saw thePandava [leader] Yudhisthira climb a pile of bones and joyously eat rice andbutter from a golden bowl. And I saw him swallow the earth that you had given tohim; clearly he will take over the earth.11 [notes.html#ch01fn11]These pre-battle dreams provide horribly clear prophecies of defeat for therebellious Kurus in their coming battle against the divinely favored Pandavas.More than a simple prediction, the dreams illustrate the terrible suffering thatis destined to fall upon those evil people and demonic beings who violate thelaws of human society and threaten the foundations of cosmic order. It is bothpoetic and religious justice that those who try to overthrow the moral ordershould themselves be violently attacked in their dreams. The “bad guy” Kurusare, appropriately, plagued by bad dreams. The prophetic accuracy of thesenightmares does not help Karna and his comrades escape their imminent deaths,but the message would be clear enough to the audiences of The Mahabharata. Themoral reality of dreaming is inescapable, and woe to those who, by choice or byfate, revolt against the sacred laws of the universe.In The Ramayana, the prophetic moral potency of dreaming is presented in a moreambivalent light, with an intriguing awareness of the difficulty of interpretingdreams that relate to strong but unconscious desires. When the aged KingDasaratha of Ayodhya decides to step down from the throne, he is coerced byKaikeyi, mother of his third son Bharata, into naming Bharata as his successorrather than Rama, Dasaratha’s eldest son and the rightful heir. Bharata has, upto this point in the story, behaved in a perfectly faithful and virtuousfashion, with no indication of any desire to overleap Rama’s preeminence in theroyal line of succession. Just before he receives the shocking news aboutDasaratha’s unexpected abdication and his own elevation to the throne, Bharataawakens from this strange nightmare:Hear the reason for my present sadness! In a dream, my father appeared to me infaded apparel, his hair disheveled, falling from a mountain peak into a pit ofdung! It seemed to me he was wallowing in that sea of dung, drinking oil fromthe hollow of his hands, bursting into laughter again and again. … And in mydream I saw the ocean dry up and the moon fall on the earth, the world beingplunged into darkness. … Finally I beheld a woman dressed in red, a female demonof hideous aspect, who, as if in play, was bearing the king away. This is what Ibeheld during this terrible night! Assuredly, either I or Rama or the King orLaksmana [another of Bharata’s brothers] are about to die. … My throat is dry;and my mind is uneasy. I see no reason for my apprehension and yet I am full offear; my voice shakes, my features are wan, I am ashamed of myself and yet I donot know the reason.12 [notes.html#ch01fn12]Bharata does not immediately understand the prophetic meaning of his nightmare.It means something bad and inauspicious, he knows that much; it involves thedeath of someone in the family, and it seems to threaten the overthrow of orderand cause worldwide chaos. The impact of the dream is unmistakable—physicalsuffering, emotional upheaval, mental confusion—but the precise meaning remainsobscure. Why might that be? Without forgetting that Bharata is a character in amyth, we can still appreciate the way his dream highlights the potentially sharpconflict between a person’s waking ideals and dreaming desires. In waking life,Bharata is a properly behaved and deferential younger son. His dream, however,foresees a radical change to his world, a change that will be extremelybeneficial for him, even though it will violate the basic laws of gods and men.The grandiose idea that he, Bharata, could ever become king before Rama isliterally unthinkable for his waking mind. What the audience already knows to betrue, Bharata is psychologically incapable of seeing. If there is any truth tothe idea that dreaming expresses a person’s strongest feelings and desires, thenthe story of Bharata’s dream bears witness to the possibility of a painful clashbetween what we think in waking we should do and what we wish in dreaming wecould do.Another popular mythic text, the Yogavasistha, added new philosophical depth toHinduism’s ontological engagement with dreaming.13 [notes.html#ch01fn13] Writtensometime during the eleventh or twelfth century BCE, the Yogavasistha gathereddozens of familiar myths and folk tales and wove them together with metaphysicalcommentary inspired by Upanishadic visions of illusion and reality. Dreamingplayed a central role in several of the stories in which characters experienceda continually recursive process of waking, sleeping, dreaming, and then wakinginto a new identity (e.g., a Brahmin priest who dreams of being an “Untouchable”peasant who dreams of being a powerful king). The bizarre narrative complexityof the Yogavasistha had the effect of decentering its audience, intentionallyfrustrating people’s ordinary assumptions about the ontological boundariesbetween waking and dreaming in order to provoke a more enlightened spiritualperspective. What the tales described, the people in the audience were led tofeel, and what they were led to feel was something akin to the Upanishadicinsight into the transcendent power of the dreaming atman.MODERN SPIRITUAL MOVEMENTSNew waves of immigrants rolled across India beginning in the eighth century CEas Muslims from Arabia spread farther and farther eastward, extending theirformidable military power and novel religious teachings. By the thirteenthcentury CE, the Delhi Sultanate came to power and established a Muslim politicalreign over India that lasted for the next three hundred years. Relations betweenthe Hindu and Muslim peoples were difficult from the start, not only because thenewcomers repeatedly looted the local Hindu shrines, temples, and palaces. Morefundamentally, their religious traditions seemed like mirror opposites of eachother. Hinduism presents a polytheistic worldview steeped in ancient myth,symbol, and ritual with no official doctrine, whereas Islam proclaims amonotheistic faith based on the relatively recent revelations of a single man,recorded in a fixed written text. Two more different religious traditions couldhardly be imagined. However, the one area where they found common ground was inthe realm of mystical experience and the various techniques used for itscultivation. Hindu yogins seeking the development of transcendent modes ofconsciousness recognized a similar goal in the mystical practices of MuslimSufis, who also used meditation, prayer, breathing, sound, bodily exercise, anddreaming as modes of spiritual knowledge and insight. Both traditions employed asimilar method of master-disciple relationship for the transmission of religiousteachings, with the guru of Hinduism roughly equivalent to the pir or sheikh ofSufism as a guide for the disciple’s systematic experimentation with differentstates of consciousness. Here, at least, was something the two traditions couldagree on, regardless of their other areas of conflict. In chapter 7[ch07.html#ch07], we return to this intriguing connection between the mysticaldream practices of Hinduism and Islam.Commerce between India, England, and other European nations expanded rapidly inthe seventeenth century, inaugurating another immigration-driven transformationof the Hindus River region. In 1757, England used the full force of itsindustrialized navy and army to defeat the last Muslim rulers and establish theBritish Raj as the official colonial government. Along with British militarycontrol came a sudden infusion of new Western technologies, medical practices,scientific theories, and Christian missionary teachings. In a relatively shortperiod, an English-speaking Indian elite with a modernist, pro-Western outlookemerged at the upper echelons of government, business, and education. Thesepeople sought to integrate the new Western influences with classical Hinduism,purging their tradition of outdated ideas and highlighting its universal truths.However, many other Indians bitterly resented the oppressive colonial rule ofthe British. They rejected the cultural supremacy of the West, denounced thedecadence of Anglicized Indians, and insisted on the need for a purified Hindufaith grounded in ancestral teachings and practices.These turbulent religious cross-currents created the conditions for an upsurgeof visionary Hindu leadership in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.One of the most ardently venerated of these charismatic teachers was SriRamakrishna, a Bengali mystic who still commands a large following inpresent-day India.14 [notes.html#ch01fn14] Ramakrishna was born in 1836, and inclassic Hindu fashion his birth was heralded by a divinely sanctioned dream. Hissixty-year-old father made a pilgrimage to the city of Gaya, where generationsof Hindus have made offerings to their ancestors at a temple of the divine LordVishnu. While at the temple the elderly man had a dream in which Lord Vishnuappeared and promised that the man would have a son who would be an incarnationof Vishnu himself. When the divine child was born, he was given the nameGadadhar (meaning the “Bearer of the Mace,” a favorite epithet of Vishnu) inhonor of his father’s auspicious dream. As he grew up, the boy took littleinterest in school or work, and from an early age was prone to spontaneousvisions, trances, and ecstasies involving a host of Hindu deities. In time, hisprecocious spirituality led him to become a devotee of the destructive mothergoddess Kali. His systematic efforts toward spiritual self-transformationincluded a radical shift in his approach to sleep, as described by one of hisdisciples:A deep jungle, thick with underbrush and prickly plants, lay to the north of thetemples. Used at one time as a burial ground, it was shunned by people even inthe daytime for fear of ghosts. There Sri Ramakrishna began to spend the wholenight in meditation, returning to his room only in the morning with eyes swollenas though from much weeping.By the accounts of his followers, Ramakrishna virtually abandoned sleep in hislater life. His contemplative practices flowed across the ordinary boundaries ofwaking and sleeping, making it difficult to say whether Ramakrishna stoppeddreaming or stopped doing anything but dream. He did show an interest in hearingother people’s dreams, as evidenced by this story from The Gospel of SriRamakrishna:When the song was over, the Master walked up and down the northeast verandah,where Hazra was seated with M. The Master sat down there. He asked a devotee,“Do you ever have dreams?”Devotee: Yes, sir. The other day I dreamed a strange dream. I saw the wholeworld enveloped in water. There was water on all sides. A few boats werevisible, but suddenly huge waves appeared and sank them. I was about to board aship with a few others, when we saw a Brahmin walking over that expanse ofwater. I asked him, “How can you walk over the deep?” The Brahmin said with asmile: “Oh, there is no difficulty about that. There is a bridge under thewater.” I said to him, “Where are you going?” “To Bhawanipur, the city of theDivine Mother,” he replied. “Wait a little,” I cried, “I shall accompany you.”Master: Oh, I am thrilled to hear the story!Devotee: The Brahmin said: “I am in a hurry. It will take you some time to getout of the boat. Good-bye. Remember this path and come after me.”Master: Oh, my hair is standing on end! Please be initiated by a guru as soon aspossible.Ramakrishna responds to the devotee’s dream not by intellectual interpretationor studied reference to written texts. Instead, he gives an immediate somaticresponse. The dream evokes vivid physical reactions in Ramakrishna—he’s“thrilled,” his hair stands on end—and those auspicious bodily sensationsconvince him that the dream itself is auspicious, that is, meaningful in contentand favorable in predictive outcome. He understands the dream to be a call tospiritual initiation, and he urges the devotee to take immediate action in thewaking world to carry out its message. Although Ramakrishna does not dwell onthe images or narrative details of the dream, we should note the theme of wateras it relates to spiritually charged dreaming. The dark, unknown depths of theocean, the destructive power of waves, the threat of a cataclysmic flood—whenthese elemental images appear in a dream, they often convey a special intensityof sensory and emotional realism, propelling the dream into waking awarenesswith an unforgettable impact.In Ramakrishna’s teachings, the common human experience of dreaming illustratesthe stubbornly illusory nature of all existence. He said, “It is not easy to getrid of illusion. It lingers even after the attainment of knowledge. A mandreamed of a tiger. Then he woke up and his dream vanished. But his heartcontinued to palpitate.” Ramakrishna recognized that emotions are the mostenduring features of a dream, carrying over from sleeping into waking, and forthe most part he regarded such dream emotions as reflections of worldlyattachments that must be abandoned. However, he also taught his disciples thatthe Divine manifests itself in waking and sleeping, even though waking andsleeping are themselves nothing but illusions, and the Divine is beyond themboth. Ramakrishna once told the following parable (which has interesting echoesfrom his own childhood):There was a farmer to whom an only son was born when he was rather advanced inage. As the child grew up, the parents became very fond of him. One day thefarmer was working in the fields when a neighbor told him that his son wasdangerously ill—indeed, at the point of death. Returning home, he found the boydead. His wife wept bitterly, but his own eyes remained dry. Sadly the wife saidto her neighbors, “Such a son has passed away, and he hasn’t even one tear toshed!” After a long while the farmer said to his wife: “Do you know why I am notcrying? Last night I dreamed I had become a king, and the father of sevenprinces. These princes were beautiful as well as virtuous. They grew in statureand acquired wisdom and knowledge in the various arts. Suddenly I woke up. Now Ihave been wondering whether I should weep for those seven children or this oneboy.”Nothing could make plainer the extremity of Ramakrishna’s otherworldlyasceticism. In dreaming as in waking, the emotional bonds of human relationshipsmust ultimately yield to the sole reality of God. Even the death of one’s ownchild should not arouse any special feelings of loss because all attachments areillusory anyway. Life is no more or less real than a dream. The path ofenlightenment leads us out of this dreaming world to an ecstatic awakening ofpure, complete consciousness of the Divine.A very different Hindu reaction to Western religious and philosophical beliefscame from Debendranath Tagore (1817–1905), a leader of the modernist BrahmoSamaj (Society for Worshipping God).15 [notes.html#ch01fn15] Brahmo Samaj wasfounded in the early nineteenth century as a reform movement aimed atreconciling Christian and Hindu spiritual teachings about God. Polytheism wasrejected as mere idolatry, and rituals of sacrifice were abandoned as irrationalsuperstition. The Upanishads were upheld as the true essence of Hinduspirituality, teaching a rationalist Brahmanic monotheism that was claimed to befully compatible with Enlightenment-era Western Christianity. Tagore (whose son,Rabindranath, became a Nobel prize–winning poet) did not come to this faitheasily; he had painful personal experience of the tension between the forces ofmodernization and traditional Hinduism, and it took a dream to help him find thepath of moderation that distinguished his later teachings. He tells of thisdream in his autobiography:Which would triumph, the world or religion?—one could not tell—this was whatworried me. … All these anxieties and troubles would not let me sleep at night,my head felt dazed on the pillow. I would now doze off and again wake up. It wasas if I was sleeping on the borderland between waking and sleeping. At such atime someone came to me in the dark and he said, “follow me,” and I followed. …He seemed to be a shadow-like form. I could not see him clearly, but felt myselfconstrained to do immediately whatever he bade me. From thence he mountedupwards to the sky. I also followed him. Clusters of stars and planets wereshedding a bright luster, right and left and in front of me, and I was passingthrough them. … In the course of my journey I entered one of its cities. All thehouses and all the streets were of white marble, not a single soul was to beseen in the clean and bright and polished streets. … I found myself in aspacious room, in which there was a table and some chairs of white marble. … Thephantom had vanished. Nobody else was there. I sat silent in that silent room;shortly afterwards the curtain of one of the doors in front of the room wasdrawn aside and my mother appeared. Her hair was down, just as I had seen it onthe day of her death. When she died, I never thought that she was dead. Evenwhen I came back from the burning ground after performing her funeralceremonies. I could not believe that she was dead. I felt sure that she wasstill alive. Now I saw that living mother of mine before me. She said, “I wantedto see you, so I sent for you. Have you really become one who has known Brahma?Sanctified is the family, fulfilled is the mother’s desire.” On seeing her, andhearing these sweet words of hers, my slumber gave way before a flood of joy. Ifound myself still tossing on my bed.The conflict between the “world” of Western modernism and the “religion” oftraditional Hinduism was an all-consuming concern of Tagore’s, as it was formany people in India at the time, and his dream offered a personal vision of howto overcome this culture-wide crisis. Driven by the intensity of his anxietiesand the purity of his desire for divine guidance, he entered a state ofconsciousness between waking and sleeping, somewhat like the transcendentawareness described by the Upanishads and experienced by Ramakrishna. No furtherdetails were mentioned regarding Tagore’s strange guide, nothing that mightidentify him as a Hindu deity. He was male, supernaturally powerful, difficultto see clearly, and able to compel Tagore’s complete obedience; that is all wehear. Similarly, the misty celestial abode to which he brought Tagore had noapparent precedent in Hindu sacred geography. If anything, this pristine,well-ordered city of cool white marble was reminiscent of an idealized Greekpolis, which Tagore would recognize as a classical expression of Westernphilosophical and political values.The Hermes-like messenger guide disappeared, and Tagore found himself face toface with his deceased mother. It was a climactic moment of dream reality fusedwith waking unreality. He knew she was dead, and yet she appeared alive. Shelooked exactly as she had looked when he last saw her, which was right beforethe cremation of her dead body. In waking life, he could not believe she wasreally gone, and now in a dream she was right there in front of him, “thatliving mother of mine.”Profound sadness at the loss of a parent is a perennial human experience, and weshall see many more examples of highly intensified, ontologically ambiguousdreams in which the dead return to the living. What is remarkable about Tagore’sexperience was that it reflected not only his personal mourning for his ownmother but also the collective mourning of the Indian people for their ancestralculture, the primal mother who originally gave birth to human civilization inthe Indus River region, worshiped as a fertility goddess by the Dravidians, asKali by Ramakrishna. Dead and yet not dead, a dream yet more than a dream, lostin the historical past yet still alive in the visionary present—Tagore’s “livingmother” gave voice to the ongoing vitality of Hindu beliefs that had onlyapparently been defeated by the rationalistic faith of Western colonizers. Hismother, and Hindu traditions, still had the power to enliven and inspire him.Her question—“Have you really become one who has known Brahma?”—spoke directlyto his conflicted spiritual condition, articulating for him the possibility ofan ancestrally blessed reconciliation of Western culture (“world”) andtraditional Hinduism (“religion”). Brahma is an authentic Hindu deity, worshipedin India for centuries; he is also a male creator God, and thus potentiallycompatible with Christian monotheism. Tagore’s mother did not wait for him toanswer her question but simply left him with the reassurance that, to the extenthe did become one who knew Brahma, she and all Tagore’s ancestors would bepleased. At this point he awakened in his bed, with a “flood of joy” carryingover from one state of consciousness into the other. The subsequent course ofTagore’s life as an activist and philosopher embodied his dream mother’s visionof a Brahmanic spiritual revival that could guide and inspire the modernizationof India.The last of these modern visionaries we have space to consider is Sri Aurobindo(1872–1950), whose system of Integral Yoga merged the language of TantricHinduism with that of Western evolutionary science.16 [notes.html#ch01fn16]Aurobindo was born in Calcutta but spent his entire youth in England, where heattended and excelled at the best schools in the country. Returning to India atthe age of twenty-one, he took a position in the colonial government, but thenhe secretly began meeting with other anticolonial Hindus to plan an armedrebellion against the British Raj. Eventually he quit the government and becamea leading voice in the movement for Indian independence, in the course of whichhe endured constant harassment and physical threats from colonial officials.Then, just a few years later, his life took a dramatic spiritual turn. Hetraveled in 1910 to the south Indian city of Pondicherry with the desire tospend a year in meditation. Pondicherry was a small colony still under Frenchcontrol, and it provided Aurobindo with a British-free zone where he could livefor a time in relative safety. He ended up staying there for the rest of hislife, breaking his ties with the nationalist movement which he helped to foundand devoting himself entirely to yogic practice. With the inspired help of aFrench woman named Mirra Richards, later known as the Mother, Aurobindo’sresidence at Pondicherry became an ashram at which his increasingly numerousfollowers gathered to practice his teachings. He remained within his bedroom forthe final twenty-four years of his life, giving the whole of his being to aquest for spiritual perfection: “The one aim of [my] Yoga is an innerself-development by which each one who follows it can in time discover the OneSelf in all and evolve a higher consciousness than the mental, a spiritual andsupramental consciousness which will transform and divinize human nature.”More than Ramakrishna or Tagore, Aurobindo worked out a highly sophisticatedphilosophical system to understand, explain, and ultimately transform people’sdream experiences. He started by emphasizing the important physical need forsleep: “If you do not sleep enough the body and the nervous envelope will beweakened and the body and the nervous envelope are the basis of the sadhana[practice of Integral Yoga].” Seven hours was the minimum he recommended,although he said the truly restful and recuperative phase of sleep lasts only afew moments: “A long unbroken sleep is necessary because there are just tenminutes of the whole into which one enters into a true rest—a sort ofSachchidananda [Ultimate Mind] immobility of consciousness—and that is whatreally restores the system.” Sleep generally lowers the spiritual quality ofconsciousness, dragging it down by “the pull of the subconscient inertia.” InIntegral Yoga, however, the goal is to maintain consciousness and cultivatespiritual awareness by the continuous practice of sadhana during sleep,transforming sleep into an opportunity for mystical experience.Aurobindo divided dreams into two broad categories. The first and most commontype he called “dream formations from the subconscient.” These are relativelytrivial creations of the waking mind, concerned with thoughts and impressions ofdaily existence, “much mixed and distorted” by the diminished mental functioningof sleep. Such ordinary dreams may nevertheless be useful as pragmatic diagnosesof one’s current life. Indeed, the Mother spoke at length with the disciples atPondicherry about the meanings of their dreams.17 [notes.html#ch01fn17] “Alldreams,” she said, “can show you what your present state of consciousness is andhow things are combined in the subconscious, what the terrestrial influencesare, what traces they leave and how they are combined.”Much more significant, however, are the dreams in the second of Aurobindo’scategories, “dream experiences of the subliminal.” While ordinary dreamformations are the products of degraded, psychologically shallow functioning,other dreams take us beyond the “veil” of the subconscient to the vastsubliminal realms of spiritual experience. Aurobindo says that dream experiencesleading into the supraphysical are likely to increase with the practice ofsadhana, just as ordinary dreams will probably diminish in frequency. At thefurthest stage of development, sadhana leads to a total transformation of sleep:“Even we can by training become so conscious as to follow our own passage,usually veiled to our awareness and memory, through many realms and the processof the return to the waking state. At a certain pitch of this inner wakefulnessthis kind of sleep, a sleep of experiences, can replace ordinary subconsciousslumber.”Aurobindo’s teachings carried into modern times the sleep-transforming goals ofthe Upanishads. In this ancient Hindu tradition, sleep and dreams are valued notsimply as sources of revelation but, more important, as opportunities forcultivating new modes of being, acting, and knowing. The individual aspirant istaught to move through the sensory distractions of the waking world, past theself-created fears and delights of dreaming, and finally beyond even the calmemptiness of dreamless sleep to reach turiya, a transcendent awareness thatfills the individual at every moment and in all modes of consciousness with afeeling of ultimate absorption in the cosmos. The ontological question mentionedat the beginning of the chapter is not so much answered by Hinduism as it isturned inside out. Waking and dreaming are both real and unreal, and thespiritual seeker is encouraged to discover and embrace the ultimate divinereality that pervades his or her existence in all states of being.SUMMARYIn only this first chapter, we have had to contend with a wide variety ofapproaches to dreams and their religious significance. The nine chapters to comewill add many new levels of cultural, historical, and linguistic complexity toour investigation of the dreaming-religion connection. To help remember andcompare all this information, I conclude each chapter with a brief summary ofwhat the traditions in that chapter say about three basic questions that arisein virtually all theories of dreaming.18 [notes.html#ch01fn18] The first is aquestion of origins: How are dreams formed? The second regards purpose andintentionality: What functions, if any, do dreams serve? And the third is aquestion of meaning: How can dreams be interpreted? These, of course, are notthe only important questions to ask about dreaming, but I hope they providereaders with a shorthand means of evaluating the various teachings presented inthis book.In the traditions of Hinduism, certain dreams are believed to originate from thegods, but most are believed to be natural products of the human mind. Hindusattribute several valuable functions to dreaming, among them the powers ofprophetic warning, medical diagnosis, divine guidance, mystical enlightenment,and the heralding of new birth. Hindus also see dangerous or negative functionsin dreaming—sleep is a time of vulnerability to attack by malevolent spiritualforces. The interpretation of dreams in Hinduism generally leads in one of twodifferent directions. In the first, dreams are analyzed symbolically to identifyauspicious or inauspicious messages about the future. In the second, dreams areinterpreted as illusory creations with no ultimate meaning; in this view, tointerpret a dream is to see through it and move beyond it. Hinduism hasmaintained a generally favorable attitude toward the spiritual potency ofdreaming through most of its history and right into the present day. However,the mystical teachings of the Upanishads encourage Hindus to look past theillusions of their dreams to achieve a higher state of awareness that transcendsboth sleeping and waking."},{"pageContent":"2RELIGIONS OF CHINAHave you ever been a student? Worried about classes? Been forced to study fordifficult, competitive examinations? Many readers are probably students rightnow, and others are almost certainly graduates of some kind of educationalsystem, so you know from personal experience the stressful ordeal of takingtests. You probably also know what it is like to have dreams of thosetests—vivid, realistic, painfully memorable dreams of arriving to classunprepared for an exam or getting lost on the way or misplacing your backpack ornot being able to read the test or receiving a failing grade and sufferingpublic humiliation, and on and on. Strangely enough, these nightmarish dreamsoften persist well after a person has finished school, with haunting echoes ofanxieties the person thought were long gone. The test-taking experience clearlymakes a deep impact on the dreaming imagination, and this seems to be truewherever and whenever a society has established a system of rigorous educationaltesting.Here is a good example of an exam dream from a young Chinese woman in the seniorclass at a Beijing teachers’ college, interviewed in 1985:After I took the post-graduate exams, I had a dream like this: I was asked totake a series of exams, I failed in all of them. I was very depressed anddisappointed in myself. When I went back to school, lots of students sneered atme and teased me. When I got home, my father said I was useless and stupid, andall the money he had spent on me was in vain. I cried and cried and asked myselfwhat to do. My mother came and soothed me. She told me that it did not matterand there were many chances. She asked me to go to another exam the next day.But I don’t know why I had the dream just like the previous one again.1[notes.html#ch02fn1]The ancient Chinese may be the first people ever to experience this distinctivegenre of dreaming.2 [notes.html#ch02fn2] An open system of civil serviceexaminations was instituted by the Han dynasty in 196 BCE, and for the next twothousand years these highly competitive tests stood as the all-important gatewayinto the elite strata of imperial government service. Get a good grade on theexams and you were welcomed into a lifetime of power and prestige. Fail theexams and you were shut out of that world, left to dwell among the poor peasantmasses. As we shall see in the coming pages, dreams about the civil serviceexams have been reported throughout Chinese history, and even today anxietyabout tests remains a prominent theme in the dreams of Chinese students. At onelevel this makes good sense, given our discussion in the prologue about thecontinuities of waking and dreaming. People tend to dream about whatever is mostemotionally urgent and engaging in their waking lives, with particularsensitivity toward threatening situations and painful possibilities. Forstudents and would-be government officials, passing the exam is clearly aparamount emotional concern, and so we would expect to find this reflected withspecial frequency in their dreaming.The common occurrence of exam dreams also accords well with the fundamentalprinciples of Chinese culture, particularly the supreme virtue of veneratingone’s ancestors. This was the core teaching of the philosopher-sage Confucius(551–479 BCE), and the content of the civil service exams always focused on hiswritings, along with a set of earlier texts (the “Confucian Classics”) which heconsidered central to the traditional worldview of China. The civil serviceexaminations required students to demonstrate a detailed knowledge of all thesetexts, which effectively meant that the students were required to show a kind ofintellectual veneration to ancestral teachings, subjecting their minds to therule of their forefathers. The exams were not just about moral virtue, they weremorally virtuous in themselves insofar as they compelled the students to think,speak, and behave with fidelity to the finest traditions of China’s past.This connection between the civil service exams and Confucian morality allows usto recognize that, in China at least, exam dreams are related to the broaderphenomenon of ancestor dreams. Indeed, many of the Confucian Classics containfavorable stories of dream visitations from the dead, making it all the morenatural for students who are poring over those texts to experience such dreamsthemselves. What we saw in Hinduism emerges in even greater abundance in thereligions of China. Dreams of deceased loved ones—parents, spouses, teachers,emperors, heroes—play a profound role in shaping people’s spiritual beliefs andpractices, illuminating the ongoing influence of ancient cultural wisdom onpeople’s present-day lives.SHAMANIC ORIGINSMore than a million years ago, members of the Homo erectus species spread outfrom Africa, moving ever farther north and east, exploring the vast reaches ofthe Asian continent. They discovered on the far side of the Himalayan Mountainsa temperate region of fertile valleys filled with animals, vegetation, and broadrivers leading to the shores of an enormous ocean. Some of the Homo erectuspeople settled in these valleys, where they enjoyed a prosperoushunting-and-gathering lifestyle for the next several hundred thousand years.Around fifty thousand years ago a new wave of African immigrants spread intoAsia, this time members of the Homo sapiens species. They, too, were hunters andgatherers who stood upright, used stone tools, and cooked with fire. But thelarger craniums of Homo sapiens allowed for the growth of additional brainmatter (the cerebral cortex), giving them expanded cognitive powers—bettermemory, more precise language, improved forethought, enhanced creativity—withdramatic consequences for their abilities to survive and reproduce. Theextinction of Homo erectus roughly corresponded to the time when nomadic bandsof Homo sapiens established themselves as the dominant creatures in allnortheastern Asia.Although archeological evidence regarding these early human communities isfragmentary, one central feature seems fairly clear. Many (and perhaps all) ofthese groups included at least one person who served as collective dreamer,healer, ritual specialist, and mediator between the living and the dead. TheTungus people of Siberia (their name comes from the Tatar word for “sleepingland”) called this person a shaman, meaning “one who knows.”3[notes.html#ch02fn3] Much debate currently surrounds the meaning of this termand its applicability outside the Siberian context. For our purposes, the wordremains a useful way to refer to the earliest surviving cultural manifestationof dreaming consciousness in our species’ history. The general noun shamanism ismore dubious, as it implies a fixed doctrine or perennial essence that does notseem to exist in the archeological record. The singular noun shaman, however,puts the focus on specific individuals, both women and men, whose ritualpractices and ecstatic experiences shared several vital features. We willreconsider this topic in many of the coming chapters, but for now we canconcentrate on the Neolithic shamans of northeast Asia and their efforts todevelop an intensified ability to interact with nonhuman powers and realities.Apparently they used various methods to shift themselves out of ordinaryconsciousness, including wilderness sojourns, descents into caves, drumming,dancing, the ingestion of psychoactive plants, and dream incubation. In thesealtered modes of consciousness, the shamans sought contact with everything fromthe spirits of ancestors and local animals to the weather, the earth, and thestars. If the shamans survived these encounters (many fell prey to illness anddeath), they returned to their communities bearing valuable information to aidpeople in their practical, this-worldly concerns with healing, hunting, socialconflict, and warfare. A person did not choose to become a shaman but rather waschosen by the spirits via a transformative dream, vision, or illness. Foreverafter marked by this initiatory experience, the shaman became a person able tojourney beyond this world, and able to channel energies from those transcendentrealms back into his or her community.An awareness of shamanic practices is useful in contextualizing the study ofdreaming in Chinese history. Shamans were active throughout Asia for tens ofthousands of years before the rise of China proper, and many of their practiceseventually found their way into the center of the emerging Chinese dreamtradition.FOUNDING EMPIRESThe end of the last ice age ten thousand years ago brought a new era of warmer,rainier weather and better growing conditions for the lands east of theHimalayas. The human groups living there took advantage of the improved climateto invent a sophisticated system of agriculture with extensive cultivation ofrice, millet, and other staple crops. The food surpluses provided byincreasingly successful methods of agriculture and animal domestication enabledthe human population to grow quickly, with towns, cities, and professionalizedwarfare soon to follow.A key source of information about the religious life of these people comes fromtheir burial practices, which not coincidentally share many features withearlier shamanic activities surrounding death, the afterlife, and spiritualcommunications between the dead and the living. Numerous grave sites have beenfound that include, in addition to the dead body, various tools, weapons,ceramic containers commonly used for food and water, and, in some cases,specially crafted metal and jade ornaments with beautifully intricate designs.The presence of these objects in the grave suggests that the person was preparedfor a long journey to a land beyond death. This is especially true at thespectacular tombs of the kings of the Shang era (1600 BCE on), who were buriedwith chariots, horses, armies of statue soldiers, and the bodies of numeroushuman sacrificial victims.At about this time, that is, the beginning of the second millennium BCE, severalcultural achievements enabled the formation of new political dynasties with anunprecedented range of unified territorial control. Improved metal working,domestication of the horse, economic specialization, and the development ofwriting all combined to create the conditions for a stratified, highly efficientsocial system capable of imposing peace and stability on increasingly wideswaths of land. The king or emperor who ruled the dynasty was directlyresponsible for maintaining this prosperous state of affairs, and to do sosuccessfully required careful attention to all possible sources of information,including any guidance from ancestral spirits and other trans-human powers. Theextensive political use of dream divination suggests that the earliest kings ofChina were essentially warrior shamans who combined military prowess with theritualized function of mediating between human and trans-human realms.The first definite indications of these shaman-like practices appear in theoracle bone inscriptions of the early Shang period. These brief writingsaccompanied the divination technique of pyro-scapulamancy, which involvedholding a turtle shell or cattle shinbone against a source of extreme heat(e.g., a red-hot metal poker) until cracks appeared. The patterns in the crackswere then interpreted as auspicious, inauspicious, or neutral responses from thespirits to a question posed by the king. The king’s questions were usuallydriven by worries over proper sacrificial offerings to the ancestors. Failure toshow due respect to the ancestors could disrupt the harmonious relationshipbetween human society and the cosmos, courting chaos and disaster for theempire. Other questions asked of the oracle bones related to the king’s personalexperiences, such as a toothache, a consort’s pregnancy, or a strange dream. Wehave precious little information about the actual content of such dreams, but wesee in the oracle bone inscriptions the linkage of dreaming, ancestors, anddivination that will become a strong element in later Chinese history.The interpretation of dreams soon became an officially sanctioned practice ofthe royal court. By the time of the Zhou dynasty (starting around 1100 BCE), aposition called Tai Pu was filled by an expert skilled in dream interpretationand other methods of divination.4 [notes.html#ch02fn4] Also present in manyearly imperial courts were individuals known as wu, shamanic specialists inhealing and spirit communication whose predecessors were primarily peasant womenfrom the outlying, less civilized regions to the south and northeast.5[notes.html#ch02fn5] The wu shamans were eventually banished from Chinese courtsbecause of their emotional instability and association with foreign enemies. Butthey continued to have a very active presence among the general population, andtheir “wilder,” more spontaneous approach to dreaming remained a shadowycounterpoint to the later writings of the political-philosophical elite.The earliest surviving text from ancient China is the Shu-jing (Book ofDocuments), from the early Zhou period. It described the Zhou overthrow of thecorrupt and oppressive Shang dynasty, portraying the Zhou takeover as arighteous victory for the core Chinese value of harmony between human societyand the cosmos, with a special emphasis on the idea that such harmony depends onthe virtuous behavior of the king, both in his dutiful reverence to theancestors and in his careful attention to omens of possible danger in thefuture. The combination of dream interpretation and pyro-scapulamancy wasmentioned in a Shu-jing story of King Wu, the future founder of the Zhoudynasty, when he addressed his troops just before a great battle against thelast Shang ruler.6 [notes.html#ch02fn6] King Wu said, “My dreams are in accordwith the oracle-bone crackings; thus the omen is doubly auspicious. We shalltriumph for sure in attacking the Shang.” And, in fact, he led his army in asuccessful campaign to capture the imperial capital. King Wu certainly hadplenty of incentive to fabricate such a reassuring alignment of portents inorder to rouse his soldiers. It is also plausible that King Wu would haveexperienced unusually significant dreams in the time leading up to an event asmomentous, frightening, and uncertain as a rebellion against the emperor. As wesaw in chapter 1 [ch01.html#ch01] with the ominous nightmares of the Kurus andtheir leader Karna, pre-battle dreams are another recurrent type of dreamingmentioned in different cultures and periods of history, including our own era ofwar and terror.Another brief story from the Shu-jing may or may not reflect a king’s actualexperience, but it beautifully illustrates the value placed upon dreams by thehighest levels of Chinese society. King Wu Ting, a ruler from Shang times,needed a replacement for his longtime teacher and adviser, who had just passedaway. The king prayed to Shang-di, the supreme god, for a dream to guide him inmaking this crucial choice. One night he dreamed of a specific man—no one herecognized from the court but someone with a clearly memorable face. The kingawoke and immediately instructed a court artist to make a painting of the facein his dream. This picture was circulated throughout the empire, and after muchsearching a reclusive commoner named Fu Yue was found in a cave and identifiedas the man from the king’s dream. He was brought back to the imperial court andappointed to the post of prime minister.Here we have an example of a dream incubation motivated by a pressing politicalconcern, with a dream response that is both direct and surprising. The dreamdoes indeed reveal the right individual for the job—but it is not a person theking currently knows. The artist’s portrait enables other people to see what theman looks like, transforming the king’s private dream into a collective imaginalexperience. When the man is finally found, he turns out to be an entirelyordinary and unassuming person with no qualification for the second-highest postin the government. No qualification, that is, other than appearing in the king’smemorable dream. The moral of the tale is simple: do what the dream tells you. Aking’s dream is an authoritative message from the ancestors and must be obeyed,no matter how strange it may appear to people’s ordinary expectations.This story highlights the strong faith in dreams and other methods of divinationon the part of early Chinese rulers, and dramatizes the virtue of the ruler’ssubmission to the mandates of heaven. The best exemplar of this virtue in theShu-jing is the Duke of Zhou, who plays a prominent role in later Chinese dreamhistory.7 [notes.html#ch02fn7] When King Wu died only six years after defeatingthe Shang, he left his young son in the care of his brother, the Duke of Zhou.The duke protected the boy against possible assassination, and at the same timetook charge of successful reforms in agriculture, urban planning, andterritorial control. When Wu’s son finally came of age, the duke voluntarilyyielded his imperial powers and became a faithful subject of the new king. Forthis selfless act of political and familial devotion, the Duke of Zhou became arevered political figure in Chinese history, the shining model of a good ruler.As we soon shall see, he also became an authoritative guide in the dreams offuture generations of Chinese people, including Confucius himself.Other early Zhou-era texts that became part of the Confucian Classics, such asthe Shi-jing (Book of Odes), reflected the official practice of dreamdivination:Your herdsman dreams of multitudes [locusts] and fish, of turtle and serpent andfalcon banners.The chief diviner elucidates their meaning:The multitudes and fish mean plentiful years.The turtle and serpent and falcon banners signify an increasing population.Divine my dreams for me; what dreams are auspicious?They have been of bears;They have been of serpents.The chief diviner elucidates their meaning;The bears are auspicious intimations of sons;The serpents are auspicious intimations of daughters.8 [notes.html#ch02fn8]No explanation was offered for these symbolic equivalencies, though it could besignificant that all the animals mentioned are “wild,” that is, undomesticated,thus representing some degree of autonomy from human control. All the dreamanimals were interpreted in favorable terms, even the serpent, though theassociation with daughters (traditionally much less desired than sons) raisesdoubts. Apparent in these verses is the involvement of the Tai Pu ininterpreting the dreams not only of kings but of anyone else (like herdsmen)whose dreams might be relevant for community welfare. In ancient China, theking’s dreams were definitely the most important, but anyone could have a dreamthat revealed something important for the empire. Signs of new births wereespecially interesting to both government officials and ordinary people, aseveryone felt deeply concerned about the prospects for the next generation. Weare already familiar from Hinduism with significant dreams of conception,pregnancy, and childbirth, and we find this same theme throughout the populardream traditions of Chinese history.The Zuo-zhuan (Zuo Commentary Tradition) is another classic historical text fromthe Zhou era. Dozens of dream stories fill the Zuo-zhuan, with images andinterpretations that emphasized the danger of disobeying the ancestors.9[notes.html#ch02fn9] Some stories involved shared dreaming (tong meng) in whichtwo people (e.g., a king and a shaman) had the same dream at the same time, aphenomenon taken as additional proof of the dream’s importance and veracity.Another Zuo-zhuan story described a pair of dreams that were not shared so muchas complementary, in a pre-battle context. In 632 BCE, the armies of the Qin andChu peoples met in a decisive contest, and on the eve of battle their two kingsboth had dreams that augured their respective fates. Duke Wen of Qin dreamed hewas being held down on his back by the Chu leader, who was sucking out his brainmatter. When he awoke, Duke Wen was highly alarmed by this bizarre anddisgusting dream, but his top minister gave him a surprisingly positive readingof its meaning: “Auspicious! Our side received heaven, while Chu bent face downas if accepting punishment. We have, in addition, softened him!” From anordinary human perspective, it might have looked like the Chu leader was winningthe dream fight, but from a heavenly perspective it was the Jin leader who wasfacing in the most virtuous direction, that is, toward the sky, which boded wellfor the Qin in the waking battle to come. The “softening” seemed to be theresult of the Qin brain matter (symbolizing intelligence, cunning, guile)passing through the hard teeth (symbolizing weapons and defenses) of the Chu,which again pointed to future military success.Here we have what I call a paradoxical interpretation, in which a dream’s truemeaning is said to be the opposite of its apparent meaning. The minister,confronted with a frightened and confused leader on the morning of a decisivebattle, may have felt a special urgency to discover a paradoxical level ofmeaning, if only to get the king’s mind off the disturbing imagery of thedream’s surface content. As it happened, the Qin won the fight, and theminister’s paradoxical interpretation was vindicated.The Zuo-zhuan also reported that the Chu leader, Zi Yu, had a pre-battle dreamthat contributed to his side’s defeat. In Zi Yu’s dream, he was asked by the godof the river to give him a set of beautiful jade ornaments that Zi Yu hadspecially designed for his horses. In exchange for this sacrifice, the godpromised future military success for the Chu. But when Zi Yu woke up, hestubbornly refused to give up the ornaments as requested by the god, even thoughhis advisers and clansmen begged him to do so. His subsequent failure on thebattlefield is explained in the Zuo-zhuan as the result of disobeying his divinedream. Zi Yu’s dream does not directly predict his side’s loss, but hisunwillingness to heed the dream showed how distant he was from the gods’ favor.In the Chinese conception of history, the consequence of such divine alienationis inevitable defeat.A marvelous story from the Zuo-zhuan told of another Qin leader, Duke Jing, whowas haunted by a vengeful ancestor from another clan, the Zhao, whose entirepopulation he annihilated in battle:The Duke of Qin dreamed of a vengeful spirit of immense proportions, with itshair hanging to the ground, beating its chest and leaping. It said, “For you tomurder my progeny was not righteous. I have already gained permission forrevenge from the high gods!” Destroying the great door and the bedroom door, itmade its entry. The duke was terrified and entered the inner chamber, and thespirit destroyed its door also. The duke woke up and summoned the shaman ofMulberry Fields. What the shaman described corresponded exactly to the dream.The duke said, “What will happen?” He replied, “You will not [live to] eat thegrain of the new harvest!” The duke fell ill and sought doctors from Qin. TheQin ruler sent a doctor named Huan to treat the duke. Before he arrived, theduke dreamed of his illness assuming the form of two boys and saying to eachother, “He is a skilled doctor, I fear he will harm us, where can we escape?”One of them said, “We will reside above the area between the heart and thediaphragm, and beneath the fat at the tip of the heart—what can he do to us?”The doctor arrived and said, “There is nothing to be done about the illness. Itis above the area between the heart and the diaphragm, and beneath the fat atthe tip of the heart—where it can neither be attacked [with heat treatment] norreached [through acupuncture]. Medicine will not get to it. There is nothing tobe done.” The duke said, “[He is] a good doctor.” He gave him handsome gifts andsent him back. In the sixth month, on the Bing-wu day, the Duke of Qin wanted totaste the new grain. He had the official in charge present it and the cookprepare it. He summoned the shaman of Mulberry Fields, showed him [the newgrain] and had him killed. When he was about to eat, he felt swollen, went tothe toilet, fell in, and died. A eunuch had dreamed in the morning of carryingthe duke and ascending to heaven. At midday, he carried the Duke of Qin out ofthe privy; thereupon he was killed to attend the duke in death.Virtually the whole of early Chinese dream theory is encapsulated in this story.The dream reveals the will of heaven to a ruler who has violated a fundamentaltenet of ancestral piety. By slaughtering every member of the Zhao clan, theDuke of Qin left no one alive to continue performing the necessary rites totheir ancestors (victorious Chinese kings usually spared at least one member ofan opponents’ royal family for exactly this reason). The implacable anger of thevengeful spirit is vividly rendered in the duke’s dream, with a sense ofinescapable pursuit and terrifying vulnerability familiar to anyone who has hada chasing nightmare (or seen a horror movie). Upon awakening, the dukeimmediately called on a shaman, who was apparently able to describe whathappened in the dream before the duke had even told him—a remarkable feat,though one that would be consistent with the powers of spiritual knowledge thatshamans were reputed to possess. Unfortunately for the duke, the shaman had noparadoxical interpretation to offer. Instead, he gave a specific andsymbolically appropriate prediction of when the duke would die. Unlike DukeWen’s dream, which offered him a chance to alter fate by sacrificing his jadeornaments to the river god, the Duke of Qin’s dream left no room for hope. Hissecond dream (which illustrated a traditional belief in the medical significanceof dreaming) confirmed his fatal condition. The doctor essentially repeated theshaman’s diagnostic practice, telling the duke what he had dreamed andinterpreting its meaning. The shaman and the doctor were both correct in theirdiagnoses, though the duke treated them rather differently. Killing the shamanafter showing him the new grain was a spiteful, vainglorious attempt torepudiate the dream prophecy, but death seized the duke all the same, and in amost disgusting and humiliating fashion. Rulers who defy the gods, beware.CONFUCIAN DREAMSPolitical unity in harmony with the heavens was the supposed ideal of the Zhoudynasty, but in practice every military leader had a different belief about whoshould be at the top of the dynastic social pyramid. Improved weaponry meantthat armed clashes were becoming increasingly bloody and ruthless, with harshconsequences for the already tenuous lives of ordinary farmers and townspeople.At a certain point it no longer mattered who reigned in the Zhou court, becausethe land had fragmented into so many competing factions that no one ruled oververy much for very long. For people who equated social tranquility with heavenlyfavor, the relentless bloodshed was interpreted as a sign that something wasbadly amiss in human relations with the ancestors. This prompted anunprecedented burst of philosophical reflection on fundamental questions ofnature and society, with a special focus on practical methods of restoring thekind of social peace and prosperity their forefathers had once enjoyed. Laterknown as the time when “a hundred schools of thought contended,” the dynamicdebates of this new generation of political philosophers were sponsored bymilitary leaders eager to find any possible source of advantage over theirrivals.Confucius (551–479 BCE) was born into this turbulent time, and he grew up tobecome the leader of one of those hundred schools of thought. His family namewas Kong, and he became known as Kong FuZi, or Master Kong (“Confucius” is theLatinized version). Coming from a family of modest means in Lu, a small stateonce governed by the Duke of Zhou, Confucius was three years old when his fatherdied. Most of his early life was devoted to farm labor and clerical work tosupport his mother and family. After marrying a young girl and fathering achild, he opened a small private school where he taught an increasing number ofstudents his simple, reason-based beliefs about virtue, justice, piety, andpolitical order. Confucius put tremendous emphasis on education. Learning toread and write, to understand important texts from the past, to analyze currentpolitical problems in rational, dispassionate terms—these intellectual skillswere open to everyone, no matter how humble their background. Confucius held adeep faith in the Chinese people’s potential to become civilized, and this faithechoes the egalitarian ideals implicit in some of the dream stories weconsidered earlier, particularly Wu-Ding’s dream that led to the appointment ofa commoner, Fu Yue, as prime minister. But whereas Fu Yue was the passiverecipient of divine favor, Confucius advocated an active striving for a life ofrational clarity and moral virtue. He discouraged speculation about life afterdeath, and he questioned spiritual explanations of natural phenomena. Hisprimary goal was to concentrate his students’ minds on the practical applicationof moral reasoning to the problems of this world.In the Analects, the core collection of his teachings, Confucius praised theDuke of Zhou as the supreme example of a good ruler—humble, intelligent, andrespectful of tradition. Despite his generally skeptical attitude towarddivination of any kind, Confucius did mention in the Analects an interest in hisown dreams, specifically his dreams of the Duke of Zhou.10 [notes.html#ch02fn10]In a conversation he had with a student toward the end of his life, Confuciussaid, “I must be growing weak; I have not dreamed of the Duke of Zhou for a longtime now.” Confucius evidently dreamed of the Duke of Zhou earlier in his life,and he associated those dreams with a feeling of personal vitality. That wouldbe consistent with his reverence for the Duke in waking life, and with hisgeneral philosophical belief in following the guidance of one’s ancestors.Confucius’s dreams thus expressed a harmony of personal and collective virtue,an internal unity of purpose that inspired his life and philosophy. When thedreams stopped coming, no elaborate divinatory technique was needed to recognizewhat it foretold.A later Confucian text, the Li-ji (first century BCE), described the last dreamthe Master was said to have experienced before he died. A disciple came to theaged philosopher one morning and found him singing a mournful song. In responseto the student’s question about the cause of his sadness, Confucius spoke ofdifferent funeral practices and the significance of their ritual details. TheZhou custom was to perform the funeral ceremony at the top of the royal hall’swestern steps, placing the deceased person in the symbolic position of anhonored guest. However, Confucius’s family traditionally performed the ritesbetween the two entrance pillars of the hall, in a middle space between theusual positions of host and guest. Confucius then said, “Some nights ago Idreamed that I was sitting between the two pillars, with the sacrificialofferings in full view. Since sage-kings do not arise, who on earth will honorme? I am dying, I suppose.” He fell ill soon after, and he died seven dayslater.Confucius’s melancholy was the result of his recognition that, for all hissuccess in spreading his teachings, he had failed to improve the behavior of thelate Zhou rulers. Indeed, the years following his death, a time known as the“Warring States” period (475–221 BCE), brought a complete collapse of Zhouauthority and a fragmentation of political power into small, intensely rivalrousregional kingdoms. According to this story in the Li-ji, the dying philosopherknew that his political and moral ideals were further from realization thanever, and he knew that no genuine sage-kings had arisen who could rule wisely orperform the necessary and proper rites welcoming him into death. This was theunvarnished reality of his situation at that moment—he was about to die, aloneand unheeded. The message of his last dream was as straightforward as he triedto be in his waking life teachings.BUTTERFLIESIn contrast to the reform-minded Confucius, other teachers from the “HundredSchools of Thought” period rejected the idea of actively working to improvesociety through moral and political change. As Confucius’s career proved, suchmeddling only made things worse. Other philosophers emphasized the natural way(Dao) of the cosmos, in which humans find the greatest harmony and contentmentby living a life of passive noninterference (wu-wei). The spiritual traditionthat grew from their teachings (reified in English as Daoism) offered itsfollowers a mysterious, otherworldly process of discovering their own personalconnection with the primal energies of creation. The earliest Daoist sages, LaoZi (third century BCE?) and Zhuang Zi (369–286 BCE) took a decisive turn awayfrom Confucian political activism and toward mystical dimensions of awarenessand insight very similar to the Upanishads of Hinduism. Particularly in ZhuangZi’s playful, multilayered poetic text known as the “Inner Chapters,” theexperience of dreaming is mentioned as a direct means of realizing one’s innatespiritual freedom:When we sleep, our spirits roam. When we wake, we open to the world again. Dayafter day, all that we touch entangles us, and the mind struggles in that net:vast and calm, deep and subtle.11 [notes.html#ch02fn11]In the Daoist view the continuity of waking and dreaming was a pathological signof our existential imprisonment. “Entangling” experiences in the waking world ofhuman society accumulate through life, binding us in ever tighter knots offutile action, despite (and because of) our increasingly desperate attempts toescape. We fail to realize that our true home lies within the ultimate realityof the cosmos, the Dao, which is always and everywhere, “vast and calm, deep andsubtle.” Sleep and dreaming are, at least potentially, a natural opportunity forpeople to experience that kind of ultimate freedom, where “spirits roam” beyondthe limits of mortal bodies, beyond the artificial boundaries created by socialauthorities.In a particularly significant departure from Chinese tradition, the Daoistsoffered an alternative way of understanding the relationship between the livingand the dead. They minimized ancestor worship and concentrated instead on eachperson’s existential fear of death, trying to transform that fear into aheightened state of philosophical self-awareness and spiritual tranquility. Keyto that process of transformation was a realization that life, death, and allother categories of existence are not real—everything in life is unstable,impermanent, and unpredictable. The natural interplay of waking and dreamingprovides the means of illustrating this philosophical insight.You might dream that you’re drinking fine wine, then the next morning you’reweeping and sobbing. You might dream that you’re weeping and sobbing, then thenext morning you’re out on a rollicking hunt. In the midst of a dream, we can’tknow it’s a dream. In the midst of a dream, we might even interpret the dream.After we’re awake, we know it was a dream—but only after a great awakening canwe understand that all of this is a great dream. Meanwhile, fools everywherethink they’re wide awake. They steal around as if they understood things,calling this a king and that a cowherd. It’s incredible! Confucius is a dream,and you are a dream. And when I say you’re both dreams, I too am a dream.Here is the first direct Chinese effort to answer the ontological question ofdreaming. Up to this point, the working assumption of Chinese divinatorypractice was a direct connection between the ancestral spirits and dreaming,with little speculation about what this connection meant in a granderunderstanding of reality. Foretelling the future was the only concern. ButDaoists like Zhuang Zi took little interest in that kind of divination. Instead,they wanted to question the underlying idea that waking and dreaming are stable,meaningfully related categories of existence (with a not-so-subtle critical jabat social hierarchies and Confucian piety). A good dream might be followed bybad feelings in waking, a bad dream might be followed by a good wakingexperience—what, Zhuang Zi asks, is the connection? We may think we are awakeright now, but while we are asleep we usually don’t know we’re dreaming, so whoknows for sure if they are not dreaming this very moment? The impermanence ofthis world is revealed in the spontaneous, unpredictable interplay of dreamingand waking, and Zhuang Zi’s startling confession that he himself is a dreamcompels a deeper philosophical question of what it means to be human. The mostdramatic expression of that comes in the famous “Butterfly Dream” passage.Long ago, a certain Zhuang Zi dreamed he was a butterfly—a butterfly flutteringhere and there on a whim, happy and carefree, knowing nothing of Zhuang Zi. Thenall of a sudden he woke up to find that he was, beyond all doubt, Zhuang Zi. Whoknows if it was Zhuang Zi dreaming a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming ZhuangZi? Zhuang Zi and butterfly: clearly there’s a difference. This is called thetransformation of things.The poetic elegance of this story is unique in the history of human dreamtraditions. To dream of a butterfly is to imagine a life of flying, freedom, andblissful ignorance of all human sorrows. Zhuang Zi’s evocation of such a happydream feeling grew out of his intuitive recognition of the experiential power ofpeople’s actual dreams of flying. To this widely experienced and deeply feltdream theme Zhuang Zi added the specific figure of the butterfly, a creaturewhose life cycle involves a radical transformation of physical structure, fromlarva to chrysalis to butterfly. Dreaming of this particular creature not onlymeans the power to fly; it also means the experience of transformation itself,life moving effortlessly from one mode of being to another, the Dao mademanifest. The ultimate awakening leads beyond the question “human or butterfly”to a joyful surrender to the eternal flow of dreaming and waking, reality andunreality, being and becoming, living and dying.A later Daoist text, the Lie-zi (fourth CE?) took this theme of dreaming-wakinginteraction in a more socially and economically subversive direction:Mr. Yin of Zhou managed a large estate. Those who worked for him scuttled aboutfrom dawn to dark without respite. There was an old servant whose muscularstrength was all spent, yet he was put to work all the harder. By day, whiningand groaning, he went about his job. At night, giddy and tired, he fell soundasleep. Then his spirit was set afield, and every night he dreamed that he was aruler, lording it over the people and in control of all affairs of state. Heroamed about and gave banquets in his mansions and palaces, doing as he pleased.His joy was beyond compare.Upon awakening, however, he was on the treadmill again. When someone expressedsympathy for his hard lot, the servant said, “A man’s life may last a hundredyears, which are divided into days and nights. In the daytime I slave it outand, speaking of wretchedness, this is wretched indeed. But at night I become aruler, and my joy knows no bounds. What is there to care about?”Mr. Yin’s mind was preoccupied with mundane affairs. His concern revolved aroundthe family inheritance. Thus he wore himself out body and mind. Now, every nighthe dreamed that he was a bondsman. He scurried about, doing all kinds of menialwork. Abused, reviled, caned and whipped, he sustained all manner ofill-treatment. He muttered, mumbled, whined and groaned in his sleep, and foundpeace only at daybreak.Sick of it all, Mr. Yin went to see a friend, who told him, “With a socialposition high enough to make you distinguished, and with enough assets and tospare, you are far better than others. If at night you dream that you are aslave, this reversion from ease to suffering proves the constancy of fate. Howcan you justifiably crave the best of both dream and waking worlds?”Having listened to his friend, Mr. Yin reduced his servants’ workload and hisown worries as well. Consequently, his ailment was somewhat relieved.12[notes.html#ch02fn12]As in the pre-battle dreams of the leaders of the Chu and Qin armies, Mr. Yinand his old servant experienced complementary dreams that mirrored each other’swaking life situations. The lowly servant had good dreams, the powerful masterhad bad dreams; their social positions while dreaming were the opposite of theirsocial positions while awake. The servant dreamed of being a ruler with infinitepower and control over others, and the master dreamed of being a slave with nopower or control whatsoever, subject to the wanton abuse of his masters. The twodreams suggested a deeper force of existential balancing at work in human life.The social inequalities of the waking world may be evened out by compensatingexperiences in the dreaming world.The parallels were not exact, however. Mr. Yin may have enjoyed wealth andsocial prominence, but the emotional tenor of his waking life was decidedlynegative. Bad feelings plagued him in waking and dreaming. Like a dutiful,traditionally virtuous son he worked hard to preserve the family inheritance,but it was (in the Daoist view) precisely these energetic activities that werecausing his failing health and restless sleep. Mr. Yin just wanted to make thedreams stop; he wanted to control them just like he controlled his servants inthe waking world. His friend was wiser, however, and asked Mr. Yin to reflectinstead on the larger existential question of his striving desires. To realizethe “constancy of fate” meant surrendering those desires and accepting whatevercame in life, whether good or bad, in dreaming or while awake, because whateverhappened in one moment would be balanced by something else in another moment.Although his friend offered no specific practical advice, Mr. Yin seemed to havelearned something from his words. He lightened the working conditions of hisservant and himself, a change that moderated, though did not totally eliminate,the dark clouds of feeling that hung over his days and nights. The implicationis that a more humane society is possible in this world, even if active strivingalways leads to entanglements and suffering. The text does not say whether theold servant experienced fewer pleasurable dreams after this change; perhaps hewould not have cared one way or another.A final dream story to share from the Daoist tradition is known as Huang-liangmeng, or “The Yellow Millet Dream.”13 [notes.html#ch02fn13] The earliest versionis found in the Zhen Zhongyi (An Account of What Happened Inside a Pillow) byShen Yi (eighth century CE). A young man met a Daoist priest at a roadside inn.As they talked about the young man’s dissolute life, the innkeeper was steaminga pot of millet (something that would usually take no more than half an hour).The young man grew tired, and the Daoist gave him a strange green porcelainpillow to lay his head upon. The pillow somehow enabled the sleepy young man tosuddenly appear back at his home, just like he’d never left. The young man wassurprised at this abrupt change in location, but after a while he thoughtnothing more of it. For the next fifty years he went on with his life, gettingmarried, accumulating wealth, passing the civil service exams, rising ingovernment service, fighting against political enemies, suffering betrayal anddefeat, but ultimately succeeding in gaining universal honor and respect. Thenone night he became ill and died—and suddenly woke up in the roadside inn. TheDaoist priest was still there sitting next to him, and the innkeeper was stillcooking the millet. The startled young man was moved to exclaim:I know now at last the way of honor and disgrace and the meaning of poverty andfortune, reciprocity of gain and loss and the mystery of life and death, and Iowe all this knowledge to you. Since you have thus deigned to instruct me in thevanity of ambition, dare I refuse to profit therefrom?Even a dream that would seem, according to traditional Chinese divination, to bea clearly auspicious sign of future happiness is portrayed in the Daoist storyas a warning against “the vanity of ambition.” Even if you lead a good andvirtuous life and gain all the wealth and status and family honor you maydesire, none of it is any more real than a dream that comes in a few moments ofslumber. There is no point in trying to distinguish waking from dreaming, nopurpose in worrying about what is real or unreal. Such oppositions are merefabrications of the human mind, and the Dao embraces them all.THE GOLDEN AGEIf this were a book devoted entirely to China, now would be the time to talkabout Buddhism and its spectacular growth from the arrival of a few Indian monksin the first century CE to thousands of temples and monasteries thrivingthroughout China by the seventh and eighth centuries CE. In this case, however,we consider Buddhism separately in the next chapter and for now merely note thatBuddhism did, in fact, enter China at this time, becoming part of the country’sincreasingly fertile (and highly contentious) religious landscape. The otherspiritual traditions we have discussed—the Confucians, Daoists, and wushamans—continued to prosper as well, remaining highly active in theirrespective spheres as the centuries unfolded. In actual practice, most Chinesepeople lived their lives by blending different elements from several traditions.For example, a person might hold Confucian political ideals, practice Buddhistmeditation, participate in Daoist rituals, and seek the healing skills ofshamans. All the Chinese traditions valued the spiritual potentials of dreaming,and popular interest in dreams expanded dramatically through the next severalperiods of dynastic rule. By the time of the late Ming (1368–1644) and earlyQing (1644–1911) dynasties, the dynamic multiplicity of dream beliefs andpractice reached a peak of cultural creativity, inaugurating what I would call a“golden age” of Chinese dreaming. This can be seen in three interrelated areas:popular dream books, incubation practices, and artistic creativity.The difficulty of learning China’s logographic script meant that reading andwriting started as elite skills, restricted to those with social and politicalpower. Over time, however, the egalitarian opportunities offered by the civilservice exams promoted somewhat greater literacy among the general population,and this had the cumulative effect of strengthening China’s culturalcohesiveness by imprinting traditional ideas and values on an increasingly broadrange of people. This process was greatly accelerated by the invention of theprinting press in the eleventh century CE, which in turn led to the risingproduction of books aimed at popular audiences. When the Catholic missionaryMatteo Ricci first visited China in the early seventeenth century CE, he wroteto his superiors in Rome about “the exceedingly large numbers of books incirculation around here and the ridiculously low prices at which they aresold.”14 [notes.html#ch02fn14] Thousands of volumes circulated on such topics asbookkeeping, funeral rituals, moral improvement, language education, andtest-preparation materials on the Confucian Classics. Numerous books were alsobeing printed on the practice of dream interpretation, and these texts bothconsolidated past traditions and added new refinements.Two of these dream books are worth considering.15 [notes.html#ch02fn15] TheMeng-zhan-leikao (A Categorical Study of Dream Interpretation), written in thelate sixteenth century CE by Zhang Fengyi, presented itself as a systematicsurvey of all Chinese knowledge relating to dreams. Zhang Fengyi said that hedecided to write the book because of a beneficial dream of his own:Some years ago I had an illness so serious that both physicians and quacks coulddo nothing about it. I recovered, however, thanks to a dream. Then I thought:Although the secret art of the ancient sages had got lost in translation, theproven cases on record could still be verified. Thus, I traced the source to theSix Classics and searched through the histories, relating my findings to variousother texts, tangentially touching on writings of a fictive nature as well. Nomatter how remote or recent it might be, or whether the people involved wereChinese or outlandish, so long as the material provided some evidence fordreams, I would pick and include it in this work, which I have entitledMeng-zhan-lei-kao.Zhang Fengyi applied the same diligent scholarly approach to the study of dreamsthat Confucian scholars had long been applying to other phenomena of the naturalworld. His dream of healing inspired him to work toward the recovery of this“secret art” of dream interpretation; what better evidence of the power ofdreams than one’s own dreaming experience? He said past generations had theirown famous experts in this art, but in more recent times it had fallen intoneglect and disrepute to the point where “people had lost so much interest in it[dream interpretation] that some crafty ones in the book market appropriated thename ‘Duke of Zhou.’ ” In fact, many dream books circulating at this time didclaim to be written by the legendary duke, and at least some people took hisauthorship seriously. Zhang Fengyi argued that the Duke of Zhou never wrote anyof these books, and readers should use their common sense in evaluating thefantastic claims made in their pages. His approach, by contrast, was grounded inactual texts and references not only from the Confucian Classics but also fromthe widest possible gathering of relevant information about dreams. A strongempirical spirit permeated the analysis of dreams in the Meng-zhan-lei-kao.Similarly, the Meng-zhan-yi-zhi (An Easy Guide to Dream Divination) by the lateMing writer Chen Shiyuan based its claims on extensive observations of people’sactual dreams. These observations led to the development of a few basic methodsfor discerning the meaning(s) of a dream. Many cases could be interpreted asfairly straightforward messages of advice and warning from ancestral spirits.Others could be understood in relation to classic dream images or culturalthemes from Chinese history or both. Still others were analyzed according toword structure and linguistic usage. A well-known example of this type concernedthe Yellow Emperor of ancient times, who had a dream in which he saw a mightywind blowing away the dust and dirt, and then a man with an enormously heavycross-bow leading a herd of sheep. The emperor interpreted the dream to meanthat he had to find a new prime minister named Feng (wind) Hou (dirt/leader) whowould sweep the royal palace of corruption, and a man named Li (strength) Mu(shepherd) to serve as a general in his army. Several other dreams in theMeng-zhan-yi-zhi, and in other contemporary dream books, included similarinterpretations where reference was made to puns, word play, and logographicsimilarities (e.g., a dream of a turtle [gui] means that something good andhonorable [gui] will happen).Caution was urged in the Meng-zhan-yi-zhi and other dream books regarding theuse of fixed interpretive categories. The same dream could have differentmeanings for different people, depending on their particular life circumstances.Chen Shiyuan was clear on this point, stating that good dreams will notnecessarily come true for unlucky people, whereas bad dreams may not harm luckypeople. A frequently cited story in the dream books referred to the dreamspecialist Zhou Xuan from the Three Kingdoms period (220–265 CE), whointerpreted three dreams a man experienced of the same image (straw dogs) asforetelling three different outcomes (eating good food, a painful fall from acarriage, and a house fire). All three predictions came true, and Xuan explainedhis reasoning thus:Straw dogs are sacrificial offerings to the gods. Hence, your first dream meantyou would get food and drink. When the sacrifice is over, the straw dogs arecrushed under a wheel, thus your second dream prefigured your fall from acarriage, ending in broken legs. When the straw dogs have been crushed, they arebound to be carted away as firewood. And so the last dream warned you of fire.16[notes.html#ch02fn16]Zhou Xuan’s seemingly arbitrary interpretation was, in fact, based on theparallel between a series of dreams and a series of ritual and postritualactions. In a culture where sacrificial ceremonies are part of everyone’s life,making a symbolic connection between inner dream and external ritual has a fairdegree of plausibility. The final twist to the story is that the dreams were not“real”—the man admited he made them up to test Xuan’s skill. Xuan replied, ingood Daoist fashion, “It was the spirits that moved you and made you say thosethings; that’s why they were no different from real dreams.” Made-up dreams andreal dreams, there’s no ultimate distinction; they all come from the same place,caused by the same spiritual powers, leading along the same path.Most dream books included at least a few theoretical comments explaining theformation and functions of dreaming. The consensus view, which drew uponphilosophical teachings reaching back to the Han dynasty, spoke of Hun and Po astwo vital aspects of the self or soul, with the Hun liberated during sleep tojourney in spirit realms while the Po remained with the slumbering body (echoingearlier shamanic dream practices).17 [notes.html#ch02fn17] The dream books ofthe Ming and Qing era also referred to ancient classifications of dreamphenomenology, categorizing the different types of Hun soul experience.18[notes.html#ch02fn18] The earliest of these systems came from Confucian writersin the Zhou and Han dynasties. The Zhouli (The Rites of Zhou) presented asix-dream typology:1. Zheng-meng, regular or positive dreams; usually forgotten, inconsequential.2. E-meng, nightmares, with groaning and screaming during sleep; caused by evilactions from the previous day.3. Si-meng, yearning dreams; caused by excessive thinking, worry, preoccupationwith some problem.4. Wu-meng, transient-state dreams; occurring just as a person falls asleep orwakes up.5. Xi-meng, happy dreams; related to happy events in a person’s past or future.6. Qu-meng, fearful dreams; continuing fears a person experienced when awake.A later text, the Qian-fu-lun (Essays by a Hermit) by Wang Fu, revised andexpanded this system. The result was a ten-dream typology:1. Zhi-meng, straightforward or literal dreams, with a direct connection betweendream content and future events.2. Xiang-meng (a), symbolic dreams of future events; examples are given from theShi-jing, such as dreams of bears portend sons, dreams of serpents foretelldaughters.3. Jing-meng, earnest thinking dreams, a continuation of focused concentrationfrom waking through sleeping and dreaming; an example is Confucius’s dreams ofthe Duke of Zhou.4. Xiang-meng (b), pensive or longing dreams, resulting from a person’s worriedpreoccupation with a waking life problem.5. Ren-meng, personal dreams whose meanings are relative to the dreamer’s lifecircumstances (e.g., wealth, social status, age, gender); a dream that is goodfor a rich person might mean something bad for a poor person.6. Gan-meng, dreams reflecting the influence of the climate, with dark, coldweather prompting gloomy dreams.7. Shi-meng, time dreams, reflecting the changes of the seasons; hence growingdreams in the spring, hot dreams in the summer, harvest dreams in autumn,storage dreams in the winter.8. Fan-meng, paradoxical or oppositional dreams; the pre-battle dream of the Jinruler is offered as the prime example.9. Bing-meng, pathological dreams reflecting and in some cases anticipatingillness; useful as a tool of medical diagnosis.10. Xing-meng, affective dreams reflecting the character or personality of thedreamer; virtuous people usually have good dreams and evil people usually havebad dreams, although caution is advised about interpreting anyone’s dreamswithout taking their individual circumstances into account.Without having space to analyze these typologies in the detail they deserve, wecan note the following. First, these two classifications (and the many othersthat proliferated in Chinese history) recognized the multiplicity ofdreaming—the variations of cause, function, and significance that made itchallenging, but not impossible, to interpret their meanings. Second, theyunderstood the continuity between waking life concerns and dream content, withparticular emphasis on the frequency of anxious dreams and nightmares. Peopletend to worry about their problems in waking life, and those feelings show up intheir dreams. Third, the Chinese typologies allowed for the possibility thatsome dreams are influenced by physiological or environmental conditions or both(very much in keeping with traditional cosmology). And, fourth, along with thesenaturalistic and fairly commonsensical observations, the Chinese dreamclassifiers also identified a small portion of dreams as spiritual in origin,positive in feeling, and truthful in predictive significance.It should be noted that a thread of rationalist skepticism runs through thehistory of Chinese dreaming. From early times, some people rejected the wholesuperstitious business of popular dream interpretation. Foremost among theseskeptics was Wang Chong (27–97 CE) of the Han dynasty, who sharply questionedthe common belief that each human has an immortal soul apart from his or hermaterial body. Why, he asked, do spirits always appear wearing clothes? Doclothes have spirits, too, that accompany their wearers to Heaven? Or are thereheavenly clothes makers awaiting us once we get there? Wang Chong took the samedim view of popular beliefs in the reality of dreams:The meaning of dreams is dubious. Some say that dreams are [caused by] thesubtle spirit which lingers by itself in the body, thus producing good and evilsigns. Others say that the subtle spirit acts and intermingles with people andthings. … Some say that people may also have literal dreams. One saw A [in adream] and the next day one indeed saw A. One saw Mr. X [in a dream] and thenext day one indeed saw Mr. X. Yes, people may also have literal dreams. Butsuch dreams consist in images. It is their imageries that are literal. How do wedemonstrate this? When a literal dreamer saw A or Mr. X in a dream, and the nextday he indeed saw A or Mr. X, this [type of dream] is literal. If we asked A orMr. X, however, neither of them would [say they had] seen [the dream]. Ifneither of them saw the dreamer, then the A and the Mr. X seen in the dream werenothing but images that looked like them.19 [notes.html#ch02fn19]Wang Chong remained a minority voice in the broader sweep of the Chinese dreamtradition. But his key insight about imagery in dreams was prescient in itsanticipation of cognitive scientific approaches to dreaming in the contemporaryWest.The strong Chinese interest in classifying dreams went hand in hand withpractical efforts to cultivate and influence them. Rituals to fend off baddreams were called rang-meng, and praying for good dreams was called qi-meng.Dream incubation flourished during the late Ming and Qing dynasties, with peoplesleeping in temples, caves, graveyards, and wilderness sanctuaries in the hopeof securing an auspicious message from the spirits relating to an urgent worryor desire. A text by Zhou Lianggong (1612–1672 CE) described a beautifulincubation site in the mountains of Fujian province called Xian-men-dong (Caveof the Immortals’ Gate), surrounded by trees, high cliffs, and waterfalls, wherepeople had dreams that were “marvelously efficacious.”20 [notes.html#ch02fn20]As might be expected, many of the dream supplicants were students seeking divineguidance in preparing for their exams, and numerous incubation sites cateredspecifically to these anxious young scholars. Dream incubation was alsoregularly practiced at the temple to the Cheng-huang-ye (God of Walls and Moats)found in most Chinese cities. Particularly during Ming times, any officialentering a city was obligated to spend a night in the temple in order to receivedream instructions on proper behavior, and judges sometimes slept in the templeif they needed help deciding a difficult case.Even skeptical Confucian philosophers saw some benefit in trying to influencetheir dreams. The Qing scholar Wei Xiang-shu (1617–1687 CE) equated good dreamswith a virtuous personality and bad dreams with an unsettled mind: “If our mindis at ease, so will be our speech and action. If our speech and action are atease, so will be our Hun [dream soul].”21 [notes.html#ch02fn21] The practice ofdream incubation naturally followed from such a view: “To be able to hold one’sown while dreaming is a sign of consummate scholarship. Such an ability ensuresorderliness in the management of important affairs. My own experience hasattested to this.” Here is another appeal to personal experience as validevidence in the study of dreams. Wei himself apparently developed the ability tocontrol his dreaming in such a way that his waking mind’s orderliness carriedover into sleep, allowing him to “hold his own” during the emotional chaos ofdreaming. Seeking such an ability would make good sense for a Confucianphilosopher (perhaps even for a skeptic like Wang Chong), though the majority ofpeople practicing dream incubation were much more interested in the classicquestions of Chinese divination: What do the ancestors want of me? Will I passthe exams? What will the future bring for my family and my community?Another area of “golden age” dreaming to consider involves the literary arts.The Ming and Qing dynasties were times of great theatrical creativity, and thescripts of popular plays were printed and widely available for new performances.The Daoist story of Huang-liang-meng (The Dream of Yellow Millet) was a populardrama, and the Ming playwright Tang Xianzu wrote a version of it titled TheDream of Han Tan.22 [notes.html#ch02fn22] Xianzu also wrote Peony Pavilion, aromantic comedy in which a girl dreams continuously of a young scholar whom sheis forbidden to see. She eventually dies of sadness, and then she beginsappearing in the young man’s dreams, beckoning him to visit her grave and openher coffin. He does so, and miraculously the girl comes back to life, revived byhis love. The play ends with the scholar finishing first in his exams, afterwhich he marries the girl, and the whole family embraces in happiness. Whateveryou think of magical tales like this, the fictional dreams portrayed in theseplays were entirely consistent with the long, rich Chinese dream tradition,vividly displaying centuries-old beliefs about dreaming, death, and desire.By all accounts, the greatest literary creation of this era was the Honglou-meng(Dream of the Red Chambers).23 [notes.html#ch02fn23] Written by Cao Xueqin(1715–1764), the 120-chapter novel follows the lives of the Jia family, amoderately wealthy and socially prominent clan living in imperial Beijing. Thestory is framed by a mythic encounter between a Buddhist monk, a Daoist priest,and a divine piece of jade, which was witnessed in a dream by the man (ZhenShiyin) whose subsequent actions, both good and bad, set the narrative inmotion. Several dream episodes are recounted that illuminate additionaldimensions of plot, character, and mood. One of these episodes is astraightforward spirit visitation from a character who was about to die(Chin-shih), warning her friend (Shen-shen) to be careful of future threats:It was not until after midnight that she began to feel sleepy. Suddenly throughher drowsy eyes, she saw Chin-shih standing before her. “What a time to besleeping,” Chin-shih said with a smile. “I am going away, and you do not evenget up to see me off. But I cannot go without saying good-bye to you. Besides,there is something I can confide to no one but you. … Our family has prosperedfor over a hundred years. If one day misfortune should overtake us, would it notbe laughable if we were as unprepared for it as the proverbial monkeys whentheir tree home falls from under them?”Chin-shih went on to provide a detailed and quite sensible economic plan toinsure that Shen-shen and her family would always have enough money to worshiptheir ancestors properly.Another dramatic dream episode from the Hong-lo-meng involved the novel’sprotagonist Bao Yu, a moody adolescent boy who essentially lost his virginity tothe “Goddess of Disillusionment” in a dream. Bao Yu fell asleep in Chin-shih’sbedroom one afternoon, and in a dream the beautiful Chin-shih gave way to thefigure of the Goddess, who invited him to listen to a series of twelve songs shecreated, called “Dream of the Red Chamber.” She then guided him on a strangejourney of spiritual vision and poetic mystery, leading ultimately to a chamber“where to his astonishment he found a girl who reminded him of Precious Virtue[a major character in the novel] in graciousness of manner and of Black Jade[another major character] in beauty of features.” Unsure of what to do, Bao Yuheard the Goddess speaking to him:It is necessary for you to experience what most men experience, so that you mayknow its nature and limitations. I have therefore arranged that you should marrymy sister Jian-mei [lit. “combining the best features of both”]. This is thenight for you to consummate your union. After you have seen for yourself thatthe pleasures of fairyland are but thus and so, you may perhaps realize theirvanity and turn your mind to the teachings of Confucius and Mencius and devoteyour efforts to the welfare of mankind.The Goddess’s plan did not turn out quite like she expected. Bao Yu proceeded to“disport himself with his bride in ways that may well be imagined but may not bedetailed here.” He then awakened in a cold sweat, crying out with fear. Themaids came rushing into the room to see if he was all right. One of the maidsnoticed something “cold and clammy” on his bedclothes, and she brought him achange of clothing. Bau Yu told her of his dream, blushing when he got to thepart about the bridal chamber. When she blushed in return, he offered to“demonstrate what the Goddess had taught him.” The maid found this an appealingprospect, and she thereafter became his secret consort.DREAMING IN MODERN CHINAThe wealth of dream teachings from China’s ancestral past provided its peoplewith a valuable source of cultural continuity through the dark times that beganin the nineteenth century in the final years of the Qing dynasty. This was, byany reckoning, a terrible and humiliating era for the Chinese. From the outsidethey suffered relentless military defeats by Britain, Japan, and variousEuropean colonial powers. From the inside, the government’s authority wasbattered by marauding groups of rebels and bandits. Physically weakened andemotionally dispirited, many Chinese naturally interpreted their plight in termsof a failure of proper ancestral reverence. A late Qing writer, Chen Shiyuan,described a dream incident that encapsulated the tragic condition of his time(1856):The Zhou Li speaks of an officer for dream divination, who interprets good andbad dreams in many ways. It is a pity that this art is now lost. … My late wifeMadame Wen became ill during the epidemic. Then my father unaccountably dreamedof my late mother. He took the occasion to tell her, “Do you know that ourdaughter-in-law is dying?” “She’s lucky,” said my mother. On waking, my fathersaid to me, “Your wife is dying and your mother says it is her luck. I am afraidthe ravages of war will soon reach our province.” And, indeed, in the followingyear, Jin-hua [his province] was attacked by the bandits, and two years laterthe whole of Chekiang fell. Our family had to evacuate and disperse, resultingin nine deaths. They were all cursorily interred, without ceremony. It wasindeed good fortune that my wife had died beforehand.24 [notes.html#ch02fn24]A dream of a beloved ancestor would usually be a cause for relief andreassurance, but in these times her words convey a paradoxical meaning: To belucky is to die now, before things get even worse. Shiyuan and his familymaintained a degree of connection with the ancestors, just as Chinese peopletraditionally had done since the earliest dynasties. Yet that traditional worldwas falling apart all around them, unable to survive except, perhaps, in theirdreams.SUMMARYThe history of religiously significant dreaming in China includes theshamanistic practices of the early imperial dynasties, the rationalistphilosophy of Confucius, the mystical musings of the Daoists, and the artisticand literary creativity of the Ming and Qing dynasties.25 [notes.html#ch02fn25]Most of these traditions recognize a divine origin for dreaming, although someChinese teachings either downplay the importance of dreams (the Confucians) ordismiss them as illusions (the Daoists). In terms of sleep physiology, theChinese have generally accepted the idea that dreaming occurs when the Hun soulis liberated from the body during sleep. The primary function of dreaming hasalways been to communicate with the ancestors, that is, with deceased familymembers who provide their living relatives with helpful messages or frighteningwarnings or both. To interpret their dreams, the Chinese have used variousdivinatory methods: comparing dream images to common symbols from waking life,linguistically analyzing them for puns and word play, and religiouslyassociating them to classic texts and beloved teachers. Some Chinese people havereported dreams so vivid and realistic that the dreams seem to need nointerpretation at all, and the Daoists have claimed that the ultimateinterpretation is to let go of the grasping, entangling desire to know what anydream means."},{"pageContent":"3BUDDHISMA good case can be made that Buddhism is not so much a religion as a psychology.Its focus on the systematic analysis of mental processes, along with itsexperimental methods of changing and redirecting those processes, give Buddhismmuch in common with cognitive science in the contemporary West. The similaritiesshould not be pushed too far, because the Buddha’s teachings encompass much morethan psychology, but it is helpful to keep these cognitive dimensions in mind aswe begin to consider the dream traditions of Buddhism. Many of the topics ofgreatest interest to Western psychology—vision, memory, language, emotion,attention, dreaming—have a long history of discussion among Buddhist monks andlaypeople. It is fair to say that in terms of understanding the nature andpotential of the human mind, Buddhism anticipated by many centuries the researchof modern-day Western scientists.A term useful in this discussion is metacognition, the hallmark of which isself-reflection: thinking about thinking, awareness of awareness, knowing thatone is knowing.1 [notes.html#ch03fn1] In other words, metacognition involves themind considering itself, stretching out the time between perception and action,taking its own processes as objects of thought. It also includes pondering one’soptions (“should I do this or that?”), making plans for future action,monitoring one’s inner feelings, and regulating the expression of desires andwishes. Metacognition has long been assumed by many Western psychologists to beessentially absent in dreaming. In this commonly held view, dreams are primarilycharacterized by deficiencies of mental functioning, particularly a lack ofmetacognition. When people fall asleep and dream, they lose their awareness ofwhere they really are (asleep in bed) and hallucinate about being in otherplaces (a foreign country, outer space, a strange house). People accept allsorts of bizarre, incongruous occurrences in dreams without critical thought orquestioning. A football can morph into a sheep, a bedroom may suddenly transforminto a jungle, a character’s face changes from one person to another —none ofthis strikes the dreamer as odd. It is all accepted as normal by thesleep-diminished mind. In sum, dreams are a hodge-podge of illogical ideas,inexplicable behavior, and failures of memory, all indicating a severe deficitof metacognitive abilities found in a normal waking state.That, at any rate, is the general version of the “deficit theory” endorsed bymany leading researchers.2 [notes.html#ch03fn2] A conceptual problem for mostversions of this theory is the occurrence of authentically metacognitivephenomena in dreaming—often referred to as “lucid dreaming,” the experience ofbeing aware within the dream state that you are dreaming. The simple fact thatpeople have this experience means that metacognitive abilities are not entirelyabsent in dreaming but are variable in their activation. A simple opposition ofclear waking thought and garbled dreaming nonsense must yield to a more complexpicture in which the human brain-mind system possesses many abilities thatoperate in various combinations across the waking-sleeping cycle. You do nothave to delve into ancient religious history to realize this is true—a moment’sreflection on your own dreaming will probably suffice. Most people have had atleast one dream in which they had some degree of awareness that they weredreaming. Many others have had the experience of watching a dream from afloating, disembodied perspective, or simultaneously watching a dream andparticipating in it, or going into a dream within a dream. Ordinary dreams alsoinclude much of the same mental activity that characterizes the waking state:thinking over ideas, formulating plans, making decisions, wondering aboutstrange events, controlling your physical needs, and so on. All these phenomenaindicate the activity in dreaming of a remarkable variety of high-ordermetacognitive processes.The metacognitive potentials of dreaming have been recognized in the Buddhisttradition from its very inception, and the story of that tradition revolveslargely around people’s efforts to cultivate those innate psychologicalpotentials for specifically religious purposes.QUEEN MAYA’S CONCEPTION DREAMIn contrast to Hinduism and Chinese religions, whose origins are difficult ifnot impossible to identify, Buddhism’s founding can be specified with a fairdegree of certainty. Siddhartha Gautama was born in 563 BCE, a prince in a royalfamily that ruled in northeast India. At the age of twenty-nine he sat down tomeditate under a bodhi tree in a forest near presentday Benares, where heexperienced Enlightenment and became the Buddha (“The Awakened One”). His lifeand teachings formed the core of the Buddhist tradition, which spread from itsIndian roots to become the faith of hundreds of millions of people throughoutAsia, and now millions of people in North America and Europe as well. Buddhismhas changed, adapted, and transformed itself wherever it has been practiced, andyet all the different branches remain connected by a shared veneration forSiddhartha’s life story and the path he followed to achieve Enlightenment. Moreinteresting from our point of view, is that all the earliest biographies of theBuddha begin his story with a dream that his mother, Queen Maya, experienced.3[notes.html#ch03fn3] Here is a version from the Nidana-Katha, an ancient textfrom the Therevada school of Buddhism:At that time the Midsummer festival was proclaimed in the city of Kapilasvatthu.… During the seven days before the full moon Maya had taken part in thefestivities. … On the seventh day she rose early, bathed in scented water, anddistributed alms. … Wearing splendid clothes and eating pure food, she performedthe vows of the holy day. Then she entered her bed chamber, fell asleep, and sawthe following dream:The four guardians of the world lifted her on her couch and carried her to theHimalaya Mountains and placed her under a great sala tree. … Then their queensbathed her … dressed her in heavenly garments anointed with perfumes and putgarlands of heavenly flowers on her. … They laid her on a heavenly couch, withits head toward the East. The future Buddha, wandering as a superb whiteelephant … approached her from the North. Holding a white lotus flower in histrunk, he circumambulated her three times. Then he gently struck her right side,and entered her womb.Recall the discussion in chapter 1 [ch01.html#ch01] regarding Vedic teachingsabout dreaming in relation to sexuality, conception, and pregnancy, and recall,too, the similar conception dream of Devananda, the mother of Mahavira, thefounder of the Jainist tradition. Mahavira was Siddhartha’s contemporary, andboth were part of a broader cultural reaction at that time against what theyperceived as an overly restrictive Brahmanic religious authority and socialorder. Their mothers each had an auspicious dream of bearing a son, which intraditional Vedic terms would be the highest good one could ever ask. Yet, inthese two cases, the dreams heralded the birth of sons who would grow up torenounce Brahmanic ideals and create a radically different spiritual path. InBuddha’s case, when the Brahmans heard of Queen Maya’s dream, they said itpredicted two possibilities: one, that she would bear a son who would become auniversal ruler; or, two, that her son would one day choose to become a celibaterenunciant who would save all humankind. This meant that Queen Maya did notdirectly give birth to the Buddha; rather, she gave birth to the potential ofBuddhahood.Looking at the story in relation to the other dreams we have considered thusfar, we can see clear elements of an incubation ritual in Maya’s dream. It cameat the climax of a religious festival, after she had purified herself andperformed the proper ritual duties. Though she evidently did not intend orexpect such a divine dream, everything she did in her eminently virtuous lifewas, in effect, preparing her for it. The dream began in her customary place ofsleeping, from which it transported her (and her bed) through the air to thehighest mountains in the world, the place where earth and the heavens meet. Theexperience of flying was joined with the beautiful aesthetic qualities of thedream and the majestic white elephant to create a positive, enjoyablystimulating atmosphere. Elephants were traditionally associated with Hinduroyalty, both human and divine. Earthly kings used them as formidable weapons inwar, and the supreme god Indra rode an elephant as his mount. Perhaps Maya mighthave preferred a human consort in her dream—that we do not know—but if she hadto receive the attentions of any animal, an elephant would be the most powerfuland prestigious of all. The phallic movement and magical potency of his trunksuggests an awareness of sexual symbolism in dreaming, though without anyparticular feelings of shame or repression. Indeed, the story makes it clearthat the Buddha impregnated his own mother, creating himself through an act ofdivine incest. A forceful rejection of Brahmanic moral authority is expressed inthis mythic rejection of a human father for the Buddha—his birth, his life, hisself-directed creation involved an entirely different generative process fromthat of ordinary human reproduction.The story of Queen Maya’s dream has been frequently and reverently portrayed inpaintings, sculptures, and stories throughout Buddhist history. Whether itactually happened is another question. The similarities between the dreams ofMaya and Devananda indicate a kind of sub-genre of sacred biography in which thelegitimacy of a new religious leader was demonstrated by post-hoc stories ofdivine conception within a dream. That was surely true to some extent inBuddhism and Jainism, and it accounts for the stylized, well-polished quality ofthe stories. It is also true that, whether or not the dreams actually occurred,we learn something important about the beliefs of Buddhists and Jainists byexamining their conception dream stories. And, as already discussed, we shouldnot forget that people’s beliefs about dreams have a tangible impact on theiractual experiences in dreaming. The story of Maya’s conception dream bothreflected and stimulated a propensity of the dreaming imagination (particularlyin women) to envision a blissful process of bringing new life into being.DREAMS OF THE AWAKENING ONEThe early life of Queen Maya’s son, Siddhartha, followed the conventional,highly privileged course of events for a young prince of his time and place. Hegrew up in a safe and prosperous kingdom, became skilled at martial combat,married a princess, and fathered a child. Considered in light of traditionalHindu values, he was enjoying an ideal existence. Everything changed, however,when at the age of twenty-nine he ventured outside the palace walls and foundhimself confronted by shocking sights of aging, sickness, and death. Thediscovery that his pleasurable life within the palace was hiding him from thereal pain and misery of human existence led Siddhartha to decide that he mustrenounce the world and seek truth, wisdom, and tranquility as a wanderingascetic. The night before he was planning to make his secret departure from thepalace, his wife, Gopa, awoke with the following nightmare (described in the ca.third-century-CE Sanskrit text the Lalitavistara):She sees the whole earth, including oceans and mountain peaks, shaken, and treesbroken by wind. The sun, moon, and stars fall from the sky. She sees her haircut off by her left hand and her crown fallen. Then her hands and feet cut off,and she is naked, her pearl necklaces and jewels broken and strewn about. Shesees her bed broken, lying on the floor, the king’s parasol broken and fallenornaments carried away in a river. Her husband’s ornaments, clothing, and crownare scattered in disorder on their bed. She sees light coming from the city,which is plunged in darkness. The beautiful nets made of precious materials arebroken, and the pearl garlands have fallen. The great ocean is in turmoil, andMount Meru is shaken to its foundations.4 [notes.html#ch03fn4]By any traditional Hindu reckoning, this was not an auspicious dream. More thananything else, it sounded like one of the pre-battle nightmares that plagued thevillains in the mythological warfare of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. Thedestruction of Gopa’s body and personal identity is accompanied by social decay,global upheaval, and cosmic chaos. If Mount Meru, the very center of theuniverse, is shaken to its foundations, clearly something horrendous is about tohappen. The details of Gopa’s dream strongly suggested that it would be thedeath of her husband, since Hindu widows were compelled to cut off their hairand stop wearing jewelry. But when Gopa described the dream to Siddhartha, hegave a paradoxical interpretation:Be joyful, these dreams are not evil. Beings who have previously practiced goodworks have such dreams. Miserable people have no such dreams. Seeing the earthshaken and the mountain peaks fallen to earth means that the gods, nagas,raksasas, and bhutas will render you the greatest homage. Seeing trees uprooted,and your hair cut off with your left hand means that soon you will cut the netsof passion and remove the veil of false views that obscures the conditions ofthe world. Seeing the sun, moon, stars, and planets fall means that soon, havingconquered the passions, you will be praised and honored. … Be joyful, not sad;be content and satisfied. Soon you will be delighted and content. Be patient,Gopa; the omens are auspicious.Siddhartha’s interpretation was paradoxical because it claimed that the truemeaning of the dream was the exact opposite of its apparent meaning. He deniedthe customary, common-sense belief in a direct continuity of dream content andwaking reality, and he offered instead a reevaluation of the dream according toa spiritually transcendent perspective. Siddhartha’s situation is similar insome ways to that of the Chinese minister who interprets Duke Wen’s pre-battledream, the one about his opponent pinning him to the ground and sucking out hisbrains. Like the Chinese minister, Siddhartha’s interpretation turned a baddream into a good one, a cause of alarm into an occasion for joy. And like theminister, Siddhartha had a personal stake in successfully persuading the dreamernot to dwell on coming dangers but to trust in the ultimate goodness of a higherreligious vision. The minister needed to keep his military leader focused andself-confident, and Siddhartha needed to keep his wife ignorant of his impendingflight. The difference between the two cases is that the minister’sinterpretation came true (Duke Wen defeated his enemies and won the next day’sbattle), whereas Siddhartha’s did not (Gopa lost her husband the next day andeffectively became a widow). Or, rather, Siddhartha’s interpretation both didand did not come true: Gopa’s dream accurately foretold her imminentestrangement from her husband, and it prophetically revealed a new spiritualwisdom that sought true reality beyond the expectations, values, and attachmentsof this world. Gopa’s dream predicted the death of her husband at the same timethat it anticipated the birth of the new religious path of Buddhism. Progressalong that path depended on the abandonment of earthly desires, meaning that adream of the world falling apart would now be interpreted as an auspicious signof spiritual development. As Siddhartha himself said, such nightmarish dreamsonly come to those who have attained a certain level of religious merit. Thecontinuity of dreaming and waking was thus broken at one level, only to bereestablished at a loftier spiritual level.Siddhartha went on to tell Gopa about the dreams that holy men experience justbefore they leave their homes and families.5 [notes.html#ch03fn5] Presumably hewas including himself in that company, and so the following represented theBuddha’s own dream experiences of spiritual awakening:He saw his hands and feet stir the water of the four great oceans, and the wholeearth became a well-adorned bed with Mount Meru as a pillow.He saw a light spread throughout the world, dispelling darkness, and a parasolcame out of the earth, spreading light in the three worlds and extinguishingsuffering.Four black and white animals licked his feet.Birds of four colors became a single color.He climbed a mountain of repulsive dung, and was not soiled by it.To be sure, these were marvelous and symbolically rich dreams. Interpreted intraditional continuity terms (i.e., not paradoxically), they augured a future ofharmony, power, and salvation. The whole cosmos would become a personal bed forSiddhartha to sleep upon, and when he awakened from that slumber he would healand enlighten all who live in the three worlds. He would be shown reverence byall creatures, he would magically unite all that appears different, and histeachings would remain pure despite his struggles with the disgusting morass ofhuman society. Once awakened, he would bring spiritual illumination to a darkand ignorant world. And this, we are told in the biographies, was exactly whathappened. Siddhartha slipped out of the palace at night while everyone else wasasleep (some texts emphasize his feeling of revulsion at the sight of thesprawled, drooling, half-naked bodies of the palace’s sleeping servants anddancing girls), and he set out wandering in quest of a new truth. Setting asideboth Brahmanic worldliness and Jainist asceticism, Siddhartha sought a middleway, pursuing a spiritual purification of the mind through meditation. Theprecise moment of his Enlightenment came in what sounds very much like a dreamincubation ritual. Siddhartha sat under a sacred bodhi tree at nightfall on theanniversary of his birth, with a full moon in the sky, and vowed not to moveuntil he discovered the ultimate truth of reality. The demon Mara appeared andtried to stop Siddhartha by attacking him all night long with vicious armies,sensual temptations, elemental storms, and cruel taunts. But the purity ofSiddhartha’s intention was strong enough to defeat everything Mara threw at him,and as dawn broke he arose enlightened, the Awakened One at last.It is interesting to note that some of the biographies describe a long,harrowing nightmare suffered by the evil Mara just before Siddhartha’sEnlightenment. Once again, the Buddhist approach to dreaming takes a well-knowngenre (i.e., the pre-battle nightmare) and transforms it into a spiritualallegory, elevating it from a worldly to an otherworldly context. The dreamcontent may be the same but our perspective on it has changed, and that in turnhelps to change our perspective in all states of awareness.The prominence of dreams in the life story of the Buddha signaled an extremelyhigh veneration for dreaming as an agent of spiritual insight. Through hisdreams Siddhartha became the Awakened One—his dreaming prepared his awakening.And once awakened, he evidently never dreamed again. The Buddha’s Enlightenmentseemed to have created in him a state of mind beyond dreaming (implying that aperson who still dreamed was definitely not enlightened). As a result, Buddhismtaught a fundamental depreciation of dreaming, a belief that it is no betterthan the waking state in its ultimate inferiority to enlightened consciousness.Still, dreams were valued by Buddhists as meaningful guides in spiritualdevelopment, and Siddhartha himself said that dreams accurately reflect thereligious character of the dreamer, with the potential to reveal importantdevelopments in one’s future. Hence, the dual view that has characterizedBuddhist dream theory from the beginning: dreams are ultimately illusory, theproduct of a pre-Enlightenment mind, but they can also beneficially influence aperson’s progress along the path toward final awakening.QUESTIONS OF KING MILINDAThe spread of the Buddha’s teachings was energetically promoted by a loyalcommunity of monks (the sangha) who, like Siddhartha, renounced their familiesand became devoted seekers of Enlightenment. Over the coming centuries theytraveled throughout Asia, converting people everywhere they went. A few of theconverts became monks, but most became lay Buddhists, ordinary people who gavealms to support the sangha and followed the basic moral teachings of the Buddha(while maintaining a multitude of pre-Buddhist religious beliefs andtraditions). Large populations of people were at least nominally converted toBuddhism by virtue of royal decree, as some of the early Buddhist monks wereespecially successful at converting the political rulers of large and importantAsian kingdoms. From a missionary perspective it was an excellentstrategy—convert the king, and the rest of the country will follow.A long and fascinating text describing one such missionary encounter is theMilinda-panha (Questions of King Milinda), from the second century BCE. KingMilinda (probably synonymous with King Menander, the Indo-Greek ruler ofnorthern India at that time) engaged in a long conversation with a monk namedNagasena, who endeavored to teach the king the basic principles of Buddhism.6[notes.html#ch03fn6] After lengthy discursions into various complex existentialquestions, the discussion turned to dreaming, and Milinda asked Nagasena toexplain some of the natural, easily observable features of human dreamexperience.Venerable Nagasena, men and women in this world see dreams pleasant and evil,things they have seen before and things they have not, things they have donebefore and things they have not, dreams peaceful and terrible, dreams of mattersnear to them and distant from them, full of many shapes and innumerable colors.What is this that men call a dream, and who is it who dreams it?In just a few short sentences the king does a wonderful job of evoking themultidimensional range and diversity of dreaming. In so doing he placed a heavyexplanatory burden on the Buddhist monk, asking him to account for the infinitepluralism of dreaming experience. And if that wasn’t enough of a challenge, theking also asked Nagasena to explain the nature of self-identity in dreaming.These questions came after several days of conversation, and by this pointNagasena and Milinda had developed their own kind of interpersonal philosophicaldiscourse: the king described the world as it appeared to traditional humanunderstanding, the monk reinterpreted that world by explaining its processes inlight of Buddhism, and then the king asked a new question and the monk gave anew answer, and so on. The universal human experience of dreaming was one moretest case in this back-and-forth discussion, and Nagasena had a ready answer forMilinda. A dream, the monk stated, is a nimittam, a portent or suggestion, that“comes across the path of the mind.” He then identified “six kinds of people whosee dreams—the man who is of a windy humor or of a bilious one or of aphlegmatic one, the man who dreams by the influence of a god, the man who doesso by the influence of his own habits, and the man who does so in the way ofprognostication.” Only the last kind has true dreams, and the other five arefalse.This answer did not satisfy the king, and we can readily imagine why. Simplydefining a dream as a “portent” was not much of an explanation, and the dream’srelationship to the mind still remained unclear. Nagasena’s six-person typologywas an odd mixture of traditional Hindu medical theory, common religious belief,and folk psychology. The surprising designation of nearly all dreams as false,even those influenced by a god, was peculiar and begged for further comment. Allin all, the monk’s response failed to answer the king’s question, though it didhint at some interesting ideas. The king’s next question focused on the issue oftrue, that is, predictive, dreams, and he asked by what means the mind couldacquire accurate knowledge of the future. Here Nagasena went into more detailabout the nature of sleep and dreaming:His own mind does not itself seek the omen, neither does anyone else come andtell him of it. It is like the case of a looking-glass, which does not goanywhere to seek for the reflection; neither does anyone else come and put thereflection on the looking-glass. But the object reflected comes from somewhereor other across the sphere over which the reflecting power of the looking-glassextends.The simile of a mirror allowed Nagasena to present a psychological portrait ofthe Buddhist mind in dreaming. That mind is neither grasping outward norinwardly influenced by others; it merely reflects whatever crosses within rangeof its “reflecting power.” Nagasena deliberately declined to say where the omenscame from or how they could be true, and he left their interpretation toprofessional fortune-tellers, whose skill in such matters he seemed to accept.Nagasena’s primary interest was in teaching the king about the nature andpotential of the mind, and this also was exactly what Milinda wanted to discuss:“Venerable Nagasena, when a man dreams a dream, is he awake or asleep?” Thisseems to have been the right question at the right time, because the monkresponded with his fullest, most psychologically detailed answer yet:Neither the one, O king, nor yet the other. But when his sleep has become light(okkante middhe, “like a monkey’s sleep”) and he is not yet fully conscious, inthat interval it is that dreams are dreamed. When a man is in deep sleep, Oking, his mind has returned home (has entered again into the Bhavanga), and amind thus shut in does not act, and a mind hindered in its action knows not theevil and the good, and he who knows not has no dreams. It is when the mind isactive that dreams are dreamed. Just, O king, as in the darkness and gloom,where no light is, no shadow will fall even on the most burnished mirror, sowhen a man is in deep sleep his mind has returned to itself, and a mind shut indoes not act, and a mind inactive knows not the evil and the good, and he whoknows not does not dream.The categories of “monkey’s sleep” and “deep sleep” would be fairly compatiblewith traditional Upanishadic notions about the different stages of sleep anddreaming, and they would also be consistent with people’s common experience ofvariations in sleep depth—sometimes sleep feels light, restless, and scattered,and at other times it is entirely absorbing and unconscious. Nagasena’scategories would be easily understood by the king and his subjects, and the monkused them to advocate a distinctly Buddhist view of the dreaming process. Dreamsoccur in monkey’s sleep, an active state of mind not so far removed from waking.This would account for the bizarre diversity of dream content mentioned in theking’s original question, as monkey sleep could take any crazy form imaginable.By contrast, Nagasena said that deep sleep was beyond dreaming. It was thecessation of mental activity, the suspension of moral evaluation, the totalwithdrawal from all engagement with the world. Described in these terms, deepsleep became a proxy for Enlightenment, another metaphor helping Nagasena conveyto Milinda an understanding of the deeper truths of Buddhism.The king asked for more information regarding the sleep cycle—“VenerableNagasena, is there a beginning, a middle, and an end in sleep?”—and the monkreplied:The feeling of oppression and inability in the body, O king, of weakness,slackness, inertness—that is the beginning of sleep. The light monkey’s sleep inwhich a man still guards his scattered thoughts—that is the middle of sleep. Andit is in the middle stage, O king, in the monkey’s sleep that dreams aredreamed. Just, O king, as when a man self-restrained with collected thoughts,steadfast in the faith, unshaken in wisdom, plunges deep into the woods far fromthe sound of strife, and thinks over some subtle matter, he there, tranquil andat peace, will master the meaning of it—just so a man still watchful, not falleninto sleep, but dozing in a monkey’s sleep, will dream a dream.This answer elicited an enthusiastic response from the king—“Very good,Nagasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.” The conversation on dreamsended here, and talk turned to other topics.What made this response so conclusively persuasive for Milinda? I would say itwas the monk’s clever portrayal of the dual paradox of Buddhist dream theory.After explaining the illusory, spiritually inferior characteristics of dreams,Nagasena acknowledged that a virtuous man could remain “watchful” and “dozing”in monkey’s sleep in such a way as to enhance his mind’s powers of reflectionand understanding. Thus Nagasena helped the king realize that dreams are both tobe valued and transcended, both useful and dispensable. It probably did not hurtNagasena’s cause that, according to his theory, Buddhist monks would be the mostcapable practitioners of this kind of “watchful” dreaming, when the mysteriousomens of the future mentioned in the first question would be most easilyperceived as they passed through one’s sphere of awareness. Kings have alwaysmade use of advisers with advanced dreaming skills, and Buddhist monks likeNagasena presented themselves as the latest and best generation ofdream-interpreting spiritual/political counselors. Whereas ordinary dreaming inmonkey sleep involved a rudimentary level of cognitive activity, the dreams ofspiritually advanced Buddhist monks included the tremendous powers ofmetacognition cultivated by long practice of mental discipline.Crucial to an understanding of Buddhist dream theory is to recognize that nogods or supernatural beings were being invoked here. Nagasena’s explanation ofsleep and dreaming remained entirely on the natural plane, referring to nothingmore than the innate potentials of the human mind. His one mention of the gods,in the fifth category of his six-person typology of dreamers, was incidental anddismissive. In Nagasena’s view, the only dreams worth any attention were thoseof virtuous people who could maintain a high degree of “watchful” metacognitionduring monkey sleep—and even those dreams were insignificant in the largerBuddhist vision of release from suffering.BUDDHISM BECOMES CHINESEAs Buddhism spread through Asia over the next several centuries, two branchesdeveloped that offered differing perspectives on the path to Enlightenment. TheTherevada (“The Way of the Elders”) claimed to follow the original teachings ofthe Buddha, with an emphasis on monastic discipline as the necessary means ofbecoming an arhat, that is, one who has reached nirvana, eliminated all desireand suffering, and become liberated at last from the cycle of rebirth. Bycontrast, the Mahayana (“The Great Vehicle”) drew inspiration from the emergenceof new texts (sutras) allegedly written by Buddha to hide his deepest wisdomuntil the time was right to reveal it. These sutras criticized the exclusiveTherevada focus on monks becoming arhats, and they taught instead that anyone,whether a monk or layperson, could become a bodhisattva, a “being striving forEnlightenment” whose overflowing compassion led to a total devotion to helpingrelease other people from their suffering while abandoning any personal interestin achieving nirvana for oneself.The Therevada and Mahayana traditions also shared many fundamental beliefs, andthe doctrinal disagreements between them never reached the level of bloodyrancor found, for example, between Christian Catholics and Protestants or MuslimSunnis and Shi’ites. Over time, the Therevada came to its greatest power andprominence in Sri Lanka and southeast Asia (present-day Thailand, Cambodia, andLaos), and the Mahayana thrived in China, Tibet, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Itis one of the great ironies of religious history that Buddhism, despite itssuccessful spread to so many other countries, was virtually extinguished inIndia, the land of its origin, first by traditionalist Hindu kings whoreinstated Brahmanic teachings in the fourth century CE and then by Muslimarmies who pillaged and destroyed every Buddhist temple and monastery they couldfind in the twelfth century CE.Buddhism came to China from India in the first century CE, and, according tolegend, the original encounter was prompted by a dream of the Chinese emperorMing (58–75 CE) in which he saw a huge golden Buddha. When Ming woke up he senta mission to India to learn more about this image, and in response the firstBuddhist monks entered China bearing scrolls of sutras. By now this patternshould be familiar enough—new beginnings in Buddhist history are heralded byremarkable dreams. Within a few hundred years Buddhism became a major force inChinese religious life, competing with Confucians and Daoists for spiritualprimacy and political authority. Mahayana Buddhism in China gradually branchedout in many different directions, with the “Pure Land” school becoming anespecially popular and influential approach. The “Pure Land” referred toSukhavati, a utopian realm in the far, far West representing the best possiblerebirth in which perfect virtue is enjoyed by all under the benevolent rule of aBuddha named Amithaba (“Boundless Light”). Pure Land Buddhism is especiallyinteresting from a dream perspective because of its emphasis on devotion toimagery (in both external artistic representations and inner visualizationpractices) as the most powerful means of progress toward Sukhavati. As EmperorMing’s dream demonstrated, the Buddha’s image had a tremendous power to inspire,awaken, and guide people in their spiritual development. Pure Land teachingsmade concentrated use of the human mind’s capacity for visual imagination as away of opening people to Buddhist truth and insight. A good example of thispractice as related to dreaming comes in a text from Yuan times (1264–1368 CE),the Lang-huan-ji (An Account of Lang-uan) by Yi ShiZhen:Recently my friend Wang Chiu-lien, a lay believer, was engaged in cultivatingthe Pure Land, on which he meditated single-mindedly. At night he dreamed thathe saw the Buddha, but always as a sculpted image, notas the living Buddha. He could do nothing about it.One day he met Master Chi the monk and told him the matter.“This is easy to deal with,” said the monk. “When you think of your late father,can you hold [in your mind] his usual comportment?”“Yes.”“Can you see him in your dreams in such a way that he is no different from whenhe was living?”“There is no difference.”“The Buddha in himself has no appearance,” said the monk; “the appearance ismanifested only in conformity with the way of things. From now on, you shouldthink of your late father as Amitabha. Little by little, imagine that there arewhite streaks of light in between his brows, that his face is as of real gold,and that he sits on a lotus flower. You can even imagine that his body growslarger and larger. Then your late father is himself the living Buddha.”Mr. Wang applied the method as prescribed. From then on, whenever he dreamed ofhis father, he mentally said to himself, “This is the Buddha.” Then, sometimelater, his father led him to sit on the lotus, and explained to him the essenceof the teaching. He learned something, and became even more devout in hisspecial exercise.7 [notes.html#ch03fn7]To the list of dream types that Buddhism has recognized and transformed, we maynow add ancestor visitation dreams. Dreams of this kind are, as we have seen,among the most intense and memorable in human experience. This Pure Land textshowed how such dreams could be utilized in the service of a different kind ofspiritual understanding. In this approach, the content of the dream was lesssignificant than the process of cultivating certain mental abilities within thedream state, particularly the power of visual imagination. A vivid dream ofone’s deceased father, which in a traditional context would be interpreted as apositive reconnection with the soul or spirit of a loved one, was reframed as anopportunity to overcome all such emotional attachments. The goal was literallyto look beyond one’s human father to see, and be seen by, the eternal livingBuddha.This connection between vision and dreaming also emerged in a tradition ofChinese Buddhist art known as arhat paintings. A painter known as Kwan Hiu(832–912 CE) reportedly developed a method of combining meditation,visualization, and dreaming to create the images of his art.8[notes.html#ch03fn8] He used pre-sleep prayers to petition the Buddhist saintsfor a vision of an arhat, and when such a vision was granted him he fixed thedream picture in his mind and painted it as accurately as he could. Thisspiritual-artistic process of dream incubation enabled him to create images thatwere strange by conventional painting standards yet marvelous and inspiringnevertheless. “I paint what I see in my dreams,” he said to those who asked himwhere the images came from.As much as they valued amazing dream creations like these, Chinese MahayanaBuddhists also taught (consistent with the earliest traditions) that dreams wereultimately nothing but the illusory fabrications of an unenlightened mind.Indeed, simply recognizing the true emptiness of dreams could itself be arealization of considerable spiritual progress. Such was the moral of this storyfrom the early Mahayana text Mahaprajnaparamita sastra (“The Sutra of the GreatTranscendent Wisdom”), attributed to Nagarjuna (ca. 150–250 CE) and translatedinto Chinese in the fifth century CE:When the Buddha was still in the world, there were three brothers. They heardthat in the region of Vaisali there was a lovely woman by the name of Amrapali,that in the city of Sravasti there was another woman named Sumana, and that inthe city of Rajagrha there was yet another woman called Utpala-vendana. Thesethree men had each heard people extol the matchless integrity of the threewomen. They thought of them with such absorption and intensity that liaisonshappened in their dreams. Upon awakening, they pondered, “The ladies didn’t cometo us, neither did we go to them, and yet this illicit affair took place!”Thence it occurred to them that all dharma [worldly phenomena] might well bejust like that. To resolve this problem, they went to see the BodhisattvaBhadrapala, who said, “Such is indeed the case with all dharma. It all arises,in all its variety, from our thoughts.” Then he took the opportunity to explain,with tact, the vacuity of all dharma. And so the men achieved Avivartin [thestate of no retrogression].9 [notes.html#ch03fn9]This is the first mention we have heard in Buddhism of sexual desire indreaming, something we know from present-day research to be neurally hard-wiredinto the human dreaming process. Consistent with his renunciation of allcraving, the Buddha advocated a life of total celibacy, a practice adopted bynearly all monks and nuns of the sangha. Many Buddhist texts grapple with thequestion of how humans should think about (i.e., metacognitively reflect upon)the natural sexual impulses all of us feel. Sexually stimulating dreams posed aspecial challenge because they seemed to be caused by factors outside ordinaryhuman control. Hence the surprise and shame the three brothers felt uponawakening—the “liaison” could not possibly have happened in the real world, yetit clearly felt as real as a waking experience, and perhaps it even left someevidence of its physical reality in the form of a seminal emission. These thingshappen in dreams, and the Buddhist response was to use perplexing experienceslike this as a lesson about the emptiness of all realities, in waking anddreaming. If we form strong personal attachments in the waking world, they willcarry into our dreaming world (an early recognition of dreaming-wakingcontinuity), and this may be truest about our sexual attachments. But in no casedo the attachments amount to anything more than vain illusion. If an unusuallyvivid dream can trigger this realization, that is as legitimate a means ofreligious insight as any other.JAPANESE DREAM DIARIESBuddhism reached Japan around the sixth century CE and merged with the island’sindigenous religious traditions (now known as Shinto), spreading the Buddha’steachings in new geographic and philosophical directions. Dreams were a fertilesource of religious innovation, as the Japanese had a long history of dreambelief, practice, and experience that colored their interactions with theBuddhist monks.10 [notes.html#ch03fn10] Much like early Chinese traditions,dreams were widely recognized in pre-Buddhist Japan as an authentic means ofcommunicating with the gods and as a source of prospective knowledge aboutpersonally or collectively significant events in the future. Rituals of dreamincubation were used in official state contexts (e.g., royal successions, legaldisputes) and in personal situations of illness and suffering. Dream incubationamong the general public was most frequently practiced at the temples offertility goddesses and female deities of caves and rocks, all of whom werecredited with healing powers in dreams. The Japanese word for dream, yume,referred to “the eyes in sleep,” and could be used both for dreams and forvisions experienced while awake (another instance showing the importance ofvisual perception in dreaming).Buddhism did not supplant these deeply rooted Japanese dream traditions butrather added a new layer of psychological meaning to what people had longbelieved about their dreaming experiences, stimulating their metacognitivepotentials in ways that enhanced their spiritual development. To mention oneexample, a lay Buddhist woman from the eleventh century CE, now referred to asLady Sarashina (her real name is not known), recorded a number of dreams in apersonal diary that has been preserved to this day.11 [notes.html#ch03fn11]Toward the end of her life, after her husband had died and her hopes of workingin the romantic world of the Imperial palace had been dashed, she saw anespecially powerful and reassuring yume:Yet we continue to live despite all our suffering. I was greatly worried that myexpectations for the future world would also be disappointed, and my only hopewas the dream I remembered from the thirteenth night of the Tenth Month of thethird year of Tenki. Then I had dreamed that Amida Buddha was standing in thefar end of our garden. I could not see him clearly, for a layer of mist seemedto separate us, but when I peered through the mist I saw that he was about sixfoot tall and that the lotus pedestal on which he stood was about four feet offthe ground. He glowed with a golden light, and one of his hands was stretchedout, while the other formed a magical sign. He was invisible to everyone but me.I had been greatly impressed but at the same time frightened and did not daremove near my blinds to get a clearer view of him. He had said, “I shall leavenow, but later I shall return to fetch you.” And it was only I who could hearhis voice. Thereafter it was on this dream alone that I set my hopes forsalvation.The sacred imagery of Sarashina’s dream was entirely consistent with theportrayals in Mahayana Buddhism of a brilliant, magically empowered Buddha whowas eternally devoted to each individual’s care, healing, and enlightenment. Herdream replicated this traditional image, bringing it into a personal connectionwith her own troubled situation. More powerful than just looking at a paintingof the Buddha or intentionally forming a mental image of him in a waking state,Sarashina’s dream gave her a vibrant, deeply felt experience of the Buddha’sreal and abiding presence in her life. The mixed emotions that arose inher—amazement mingled with fear—propelled her into a mystical state of knowingthat transcended ordinary human categories and perceptions, as further indicatedby the fact that only she could see and hear the Buddha. Her dream revealed aspecial truth that extended beyond the sphere of usual human cognition, beyondthe sorry, dead-end circumstances of her life. Whatever other people could orcould not see and hear, she now knew, because of her dream, that Amida Buddhawas as devoted to her as she was to him.An even more detailed dream diary was kept by Myoe Shonin (1173–1232 CE), awidely venerated monk and leader of the Kegon sect of Japanese Buddhism, whichcentered its approach on the Buddha’s teachings in his first sermon at Benares.Myoe was an active meditator and accomplished visionary, and he took hisdreaming as seriously as any other realm of spiritual practice. For about fortyyears, from the ages of nineteen to fifty-eight, Myoe wrote out his dreams in anongoing autobiography of religious experience he titled Yume no ki (“Records ofDreams”).12 [notes.html#ch03fn12] This extraordinary document deserves much moreattention than is possible in this limited space, but several features can bementioned. To begin, many of the dreams appear entirely un spiritual and arerecorded without any further comment or interpretation. Myoe evidently acceptedthat not all dreams are explicitly religious in their significance, though hestill found it worthwhile to write them down. Several of his dreams were, ofcourse, spiritually meaningful to him, and to these he applied a symbolicinterpretation according to traditional Buddhist iconography. He looked to hisdreams for practical guidance and encouraging insight, commenting after one, “Ishould know this.” The full range of human emotion was represented in Myoe’sdreams, from joy and wonder to anger, fear, and sadness. Notwithstanding hisfidelity to a celibate lifestyle, he reported a few dreams of intimate relationswith women, though without mentioning any particular anxiety about them. Myoesaw his dreams as real experiences in another dimension of human reality, nodifferent from waking reality in holding out both endless temptations ofemotional attachment and excellent opportunities for cultivating greaterspiritual knowledge and metacognitive power. As an example of the latter, Myoerecorded this dream when he was forty-seven years old:On the night of the 20th day of the 9th month of [1220 CE], I had a dream abouta large object which resembled a sheep in the sky. It went through unendingtransformations. Sometimes it was like a light, sometimes it resembled a humanfigure. When it was like an aristocrat wearing a cap, it suddenly changed into acommoner who descended to the ground. The priest Girin was there. He looked atit, was disgusted, and detested it. It turned to me and seemed to want to saysomething. I thought to myself that this was a constellation that hadtransformed and manifested itself. I thought highly of it. I wanted to resolvemy uncertainty. Then it turned to me and said, “Many [priests] should not acceptthe faith and offerings of other people.” Then I understood it. I asked it,“Where will I be reborn next?” It replied, “In the Trayastrimsas Heaven.” Iasked, “When I am reborn there, will I already be unattached to the five desiresand be practicing the Buddha’s way?” It replied, “Yes.” The heavenly being said,“Shouldn’t you keep from burning your head?” I replied, “Yes.” I thought, Mynext life will be good. Why do I try to anticipate it? I think it was telling methat I need only do what I must before people in this world. Again I said, “Willyou always protect me like this?” It said, “Yes.” Then I awoke.Myoe added nothing more about the dream, which essentially interpreted itself.He found himself witnessing the paradoxical movement of an endlesslytransforming object or constellation of energy, shifting from pure light tohuman form, then from a person of high status to a person of low social rank.The priest’s reaction of disgust to the object’s manifestation as a commoner wassymptomatic of a broader misunderstanding of the key Buddhist insight that allsuch appearances are illusory and should not elicit any emotional reaction,positive or negative. It should be noted that sudden transformations of form andcharacter are a rare but widely reported dream phenomenon in all populations,reflecting the natural dissolution in dreaming of ordinary cognitive boundaries.Whereas the priest turned away from the socially insignificant figure, Myoeapproached the being with a sense of curiosity, purpose, and respect. Hismetacognitive reflections did not turn to analyzing the dream state itself; hewas looking for insight beyond the simple recognition “I am dreaming.” Myoewanted to learn as much as he could from this extraordinary spiritual entity.His first questions regarded the fate of his next rebirth (a natural source ofpreoccupation for a monk) and the favorable answer from the heavenly beingpleased him. But then the cryptic advice to “keep from burning your head”prompted an even higher level of self-reflection in Myoe, as he questioned hisown anxious anticipation of a good rebirth. At this point he was able tounderstand (whether in waking or dreaming is unclear) that, in practical terms,the being’s advice could be crystallized as one of Buddhism’s basic truths:forego attachments to all worlds and follow the middle path of doing what onemust do, neither more nor less. Like Lady Sarashina, Myoe asked for and receiveda final reassurance that this compassionate heavenly being would continue caringfor him in waking life as much as in dreaming.The Yume no ki was widely admired in Japan as the chronicle of a wise andspiritually conscious life, a life worth every effort to emulate in one’s ownpersonal circumstances. Myoe’s dreaming autobiography very likely provoked newdreams in other people who, after reading about his experiences, openedthemselves to similar potentials in their own visionary imaginations.TANTRIC BUDDHISM IN TIBETFor tens of thousands of years the Tibetan plateau was the home of resilientgroups of humans who survived as nomadic herders and hunters in the cold, aridenvironment, surrounded by the tallest mountains in the world. These peopledeveloped a tradition of shamanic-style religious practices (Bon) involvingnature spirits, elemental forces, and specialized healing techniques. In theseventh century CE the first Buddhist monks arrived from India, bringing withthem texts to be translated into the Tibetan people’s own language. Theseteachings promoted a new offshoot of the Mahayana school, known as Tantrayana(also referred to as Vajrayana). Indeed, the approach of Tantrayana was sodistinctive that some people regarded it as a third vehicle of the Buddha’struth. It focused on the personal, secret transmission of wisdom from a master(siddhi, “perfected one”) to a disciple. These esoteric teachings includedvarious pre-Buddhist rituals and yogic practices such as chanting mantras,visualizing deities, and controlling multiple aspects of one’s physicalfunctioning. Some Tantric practices involved ritualized iconoclasm andtransgressions of monastic morality (e.g., eating meat, drinking wine, havingsex). The unifying theme in all this was the notion that the human body is aspiritual microcosm that can be deliberately used and cultivated as a conduitfor divine energy.The teachings of Tantrayana found their way into both Buddhist and Hindutraditions throughout South Asia, but nowhere did they take deeper root or growto greater cultural power than in Tibet. The numerous analogies with traditionalBon spirituality must have helped, and so did a visit in 774 CE by the famousIndian Tantric monk Padmasambhava which led to the founding of several schoolsthat are still primary forces in Tibetan Buddhism today. One of these lineages,the Kagya, put special emphasis on the teachings of the eleventh-century Indiansage Naropa, and here is where dreaming emerged as a special theme in theTantrayana of Tibet. Naropa wrote a lengthy text (Na Ro Chos Drug, “The SixYogas of Naropa”) in which he gathered and systematized a wide range of ancientTantric rituals. The six yogas were Inner Heat (Tummo), Illusory Body (Gyulus),Dream (Milam), Light (Odsal), Transference of Consciousness (Phowa), and theIntermediate State (between death and rebirth) (Bardo). These were secretteachings designed to help disciples develop greater control of body andconsciousness across all states of being, from waking to dreaming, from livingto dying.The third yoga of dreams was predicated on the disciple already having masteredthe first two yogas under the supervision of an experienced instructor, and itspractice was specifically motivated by the same desire for BuddhistEnlightenment that animated all Tantric teachings.13 [notes.html#ch03fn13] Thus,it is difficult to discuss the yoga of dreams in isolation from that broaderreligious framework. A full account would require more attention to linguisticand philosophical details than is possible here. Still, we have been gatheringenough comparative information from other religious traditions (with much moreto come) to justify a few comments about significant features in Naropa’s textthat directly relate to religiously meaningful dream phenomena that we haveidentified in other places and times.The third yoga of Naropa presents what we can recognize as a detailed program ofdream incubation. Disciples were carefully instructed on various means ofcontrolling their sleep and dream patterns, including the use of visualizations,prayers, chanting, breathing exercises, and bodily postures. These are classicmethods used in many religious traditions for the purpose of eliciting aspiritually meaningful dream. The distinctive feature of Naropa’s yoga was thatthe disciple’s only goal should be achieving consciousness within the dream—inother words, cultivating powers of dreaming metacognition. Naropa saw sleep anddreaming as further opportunities to develop the same self-reflective insightsthat came from waking meditation. To realize that one’s dreams are self-createdillusions is to move one step closer to the final realization that all realitiesare self-created illusions. In this regard, Naropa’s yogic teachings have muchin common with dream themes from the Upanishads, Daoism, early Buddhism, andlatter-day Hinduism. Taking little interest in the content of dreams, all thesetraditions seek to transcend the experience of dreaming in quest of a higherstate of dreamless sleep, leading ultimately to the pure consciousness ofEnlightenment.Naropa’s teachings were given vividly colorful expression in the mysticalautobiography of Milarepa, the twelfth-century-CE sage who was something of aspiritual grandson to Naropa. The Six Yogas were brought to Tibet by Naropa’sdisciple Marpa, who in turn passed them on to Milarepa. The story of Milarepa’spath toward spiritual perfection was widely known and venerated among theTibetan people, and most remarkable from our perspective is how cruciallyimportant dreams were at every step of his development.14 [notes.html#ch03fn14]To begin (of course), the night before Milarepa first met Marpa the latter had adream of Naropa in which the Great Master blessed Marpa and guided him through aritual practice within the dream itself:Naropa gave Marpa a slightly tarnished, five-pronged vajra [scepter] made oflapis lazuli. At the same time he gave him a golden vase filled with nectar andtold him, “With the water in this vase wash the dirt from the vajra, then mountit on top of the banner-of-victory. This will please the Buddhas of the past andmake all sentient beings happy, thus fulfilling both your aim and that ofothers.” Then Naropa vanished. Following the instructions of his Master, Marpawashed the vajra with water from the vase, and mounted it on top of thebanner-of-victory. Then the brilliance of this vajra lit up the whole universe.Immediately the six classes of being, struck with wonder by its light, werefreed from sorrow and filled with happiness. They prostrated themselves and paidreverence to the Venerable Marpa and his banner-of-victory, which had beenconsecrated by the Buddhas of the past.At this moment, “somewhat surprised by this dream,” Marpa awoke. His initialreaction was “joy and love,” but just then he was approached by his wife, whosaid she had just awakened from a dream, too. In her dream,Two women who said they came from Ugyen in the north were carrying a crystalstupa [Buddhist monument/reliquary]. This stupa had some impurities on itssurface. And the woman said, “Naropa commands the lama to consecrate this stupaand to place it on the summit of a mountain.” And you yourself cried out,“Although the consecration of this stupa has already been accomplished by MasterNaropa, I must obey his command.” And you washed the stupa with the lustralwater in the vase and performed the consecration. Afterward you placed it on themountaintop, where it radiated a multitude of lights as dazzling as the sun andmoon and where it projected numerous replicas of itself upon the mountaintops.And the two women watched over these stupas.These shared dreams provided a strange, dual-focused perspective on the imminentarrival of Milarepa. Both dreams involved Marpa receiving ritual instructionsfrom Naropa and then performing the ritual while still in the dream, and in bothhe enjoyed brilliant success for his efforts. In Marpa’s own dream theinstructions came directly from Naropa, and the ritual culminated in a rathergrandiose scene of the whole universe bowing down and worshiping Marpa. In hiswife’s dream the instructions came indirectly, via the two mysterious women, andMarpa did not understand the ritual’s purpose, though of course he faithfullyperformed it. The result was a dazzling but more earthly spectacle of lightreflected against the familiar mountaintops encircling the Tibetan plateau. Thedifferences between the two dreams may be attributed in part to the genderdynamics between Marpa and his wife, with his dream accurately reflecting hismasculine authority and religious centrality and her dream accurately reflectingher feminine subservience and religious marginality.Either way, the two dreams augured well. Naropa was calling on Marpa to performa spiritual service that would be to his and the whole world’s benefit. And thatservice would be to initiate Milarepa into the Six Yogas. As in so many otherBuddhist stories, a moment of spiritual “birth” is marked by anticipatorydreaming. The phenomenon of shared dreams at the beginning of Milarepa’s storyindicated that this would be an especially momentous birth. It also suggestedthat Milarepa’s story would be unusually rich in dream experience. There was noquestion, however, of forgetting the fundamental Buddhist tenet that dreaminghas no ultimate meaning or value, as the text made clear in a scene ofunapologetic marital deception. Marpa’s wife finished her narrative and said toher husband, “Such was my dream. What is its meaning?” Marpa instantlyrecognized her dream’s favorable import and its connection to his own dream, andhe felt secretly happy. But he told none of this to his wife. Rather, he usedthe Buddhist depreciation of dreams to shut her up: “To his own wife he onlysaid, ‘I do not know the meaning since dreams have no source. Now I am going toplow the field near the road. Prepare what I need.’ ” No explanation was givenfor Marpa’s behavior, and perhaps none was needed given the enormous differencesof status between men and women in Buddhism. Still, the incident is noteworthyin that it shows the potential of the “dreams are illusory” idea to be used as ameans of stifling other people’s dreaming imaginations. Nothing more was heardfrom Marpa’s wife. She acceded to his odd decision (plowing fields was usuallythe work of much younger men) and packed him provisions for the day. Thusprepared by his silent wife, Marpa set out for the fields where later that dayhe would first meet Milarepa.Dreaming became a surprisingly precise force of guidance in Milarepa’s spiritualgrowth. In one instance, Milarepa dreamed of a dakini, one of the powerful andunpredictable feminine deities of Hindu-Buddhist mythology. She appeared as agloriously beautiful figure of blue light and told him he must ask to be taughtthe fifth yoga of Naropa, on the Transference of Consciousness to Dead Bodies.Milarepa awoke and immediately felt unsure of the dream’s legitimacy as areligious teaching. He thought to himself, the woman was only dressed in thecostume of a dakini—so maybe she wasn’t a real messenger from heaven at all,maybe the whole thing was just a demon’s trick. Troubled and confused, Milarepawent to ask for Marpa’s interpretive help. The irascible teacher beratedMilarepa for breaking his meditative practice, and then declared that the dreamwas a warning from the dakinis requiring Marpa to make an arduous journey toNaropa’s hermitage in India to ask the Master for this very teaching. When Marpafinally reached Naropa and told him of Milarepa’s dream, the Master praised thedisciple as a marvel: “In the dark land of Tibet, this disciple is like the sunrising over the snows.”Later, the unexpected death of Marpa’s son prompted a succession crisis in thelineage, with his disciples anxiously questioning the future leadership of theKagyu doctrine. Marpa responded by declaring that he, Naropa, and all of theMaster’s spiritual descendents had the power to prophesize through dreams. Marpathus instructed his disciples to focus their attention on their own dreams, andto be on the lookout for guidance from Naropa. The next morning the disciplesgathered to discuss their dreams. All the dreams were happy and positive, butnone provided the sought-for prophetic guidance. Then Milarepa told of hisdream:I dreamed that in the vast North of the worldA majestic snow-clad mountain arose,Its white peak touching the sky.Around it turned the sun and moon,Its light filled the whole of space,And its base covered the entire Earth.Rivers descended in the four cardinal directions,Quenching the thirst of all sentient beings,And all these waters rushed into the sea.A myriad of flowers sparkled.Such in general was the dream I had.Milarepa went on to describe in poetic detail the further visions of his dream,including the four pillars of the world in the East, West, South, and North. Thelatter he associated with himself, as the pillar of the North corresponding tothe mountain of the North. Milarepa finished by interpreting his own experience:“The dream of the North is not ill-fated. It is favorable, O monks and disciplesassembled in this place.” Taken as a whole, Milarepa’s dream prophesized afuture of strength and prosperity for the Kagyu lineage and its “perfectteaching.” Marpa and the others responded joyfully to Milarepa’s dream, andMarpa (who may have noticed similarities with his own lofty dreams) instructedhim to remain there in meditative seclusion for the next several years until hisinitiation was completed. Milarepa obediently withdrew to a cave. However, ashort time later Marpa’s plan for him was disrupted when Milarepa experienced avivid and deeply disturbing dream:While in seclusion I did not normally fall asleep but early one morning I dozedoff and had this dream: I had come to my village of Kya Ngatsa. My house, FourColumns and Eight Beams, was cracked like the ears of an old donkey. The rainhad leaked throughout the house and had damaged the sacred books, Castle ofJewels. My field, Fertile Triangle, was overrun with weeds. My mother and myrelatives were dead. My sister had left to wander and beg. Because our relativeshad risen up as enemies against my mother and son, I had, from my youth, beenseparated from my mother and had not seen her again. This thought caused meimmense pain. I called to my mother and sister by name and wept. I awoke and mypillow was wet with tears.This dream had an immediate and decisive impact on Milarepa’s waking life. Hismind was filled with memories of his mother. He continued to cry in sadness, andwith no further thought he “resolved to do everything necessary to see heragain.” The contrast between this dream and his “mountain/pillar of the North”dream could not be sharper. The former was pure heavenly order and serenecontemplation, and the latter overflowed with raw emotion, human frailty, andearthly decay. Milarepa had already benefited from the guidance of dreams, andin this case he wasted no time in rising from his cave and informing Marpa ofhis decision to return home to see his family. Marpa warned Milarepa of what hemight find, and added that if Milarepa left he would never see Marpa alive again(because Milarepa had awakened Marpa from sleeping to tell him this news).Milarepa was not to be deterred, and after a lengthy farewell he took his leave.When he finally arrived in his native land he found to his sorrow thateverything was exactly as his dream had foretold. His fields were overgrown withweeds, his house was an abandoned wreck, his sacred books were covered in mud,and there, in the middle of the ruins, was a pile of bleached, crumbledbones—all that was left of his mother. Choking with emotion, Milarepa nearlypassed out, but suddenly the teachings of Marpa sprang into his mind, and achange came over him. He sat down amid the bones and began meditating with anabsolute purity of concentration that lasted for the next seven days, afterwhich he chanted a song about the futility of samsara and the illusoryattachments of the human family. In this way Milarepa went beyond a mereintellectual acceptance of Marpa’s Tantric Buddhist teachings to a deeply felt,life-transforming experience of them. His dream catalyzed the process,propelling him out of the incubatory space of the cave into the passionate,ultimately vain entanglements of family relations and finally to a new realm ofinsight and understanding. The dream was accurate in its clairvoyant portrayalof the situation at his home (adding to the notion of Tantric Masters as magicaldreamers), and its alarmingly extreme emotions, so contrary to the Buddhistideal of freedom from emotionality, actually served as a means to the end of amajor advance in Milarepa’s initiation. What seemed at first to be an impulsivedeviation from Marpa’s teachings turned out to be exactly what Milarepa neededfor his further spiritual development.A similar process unfolded a while later, while Milarepa was visiting withformer relatives and neighbors. He had a dream “foretelling a happy event if Iwere to remain for a few days.” Immediately afterward he re-encountered a womannamed Zessay, a villager with whom he had once shared a flirtatiousrelationship. Milarepa and Zessay reminisced about his mother, and they bothshed tears over her death. Then Zessay asked why Milarepa had never married. Hetried to explain his choosing a life of celibacy, and Zessay countered withquestions about why an authentically religious life could not also includesexual intimacy. He offered to give her his family fields as a kind ofconsolation for not marrying her, and she angrily refused. The conversationended awkwardly. Then Milarepa’s aunt, who saw profitability for herself in hernephew’s celibate ways, persuaded him to give her title to the house and fields.Milarepa said that these upsetting events made it difficult to meditateafterward:I was completely unable even to attain the blissful experience of inner warmthand, while I was wondering what to do, I had this dream: I was plowing a stripof my field. The earth was hard and I asked myself if I should give it up. Thenthe venerable Marpa appeared in the sky and said to me, “My son, strengthen yourwill, have courage, and work; you will furrow the hard and dry earth.” Speakingin this way, Marpa guided me and I plowed my field. Immediately a thick andabundant harvest sprang up.Milarepa said that he awoke filled with happiness at what was clearly animportant message of reassurance and encouragement from his Master. From hisfirst meeting with Marpa, the image of the field was a key emblem of Milarepa’sspiritual life, and here it gave him a vision of himself finally letting go ofhis attachments to earthly life in favor of higher spiritual work. But Milarepaalso chided himself for his gullibility in taking any dream seriously, and inthis he displayed the characteristic ambivalence of Buddhism toward dreaming:“Since dreams are nothing more than projections of hidden thoughts, not evenfools believe they are real, I am more foolish than they are. Even so, I tookthis dream to mean that if I persevered in my efforts at meditation I wouldattain a new quality of inner experience.” Dreams themselves may be illusions,but the dreams of a Tantric adept may convey valuable teachings nevertheless.The popular belief in prophetic dreams was elevated from an earthly to aspiritual plane, as Milarepa interpreted his dream as a symbolic expression ofBuddhist practice—“I cultivate the field of fundamentally non-discriminatorymind with the manure and water of faith, and sow the seed of a pureheart”—rather than as a literal reference to the actual field of his family, theone he just gave away to his aunt, the one he could have plowed in worldlycontentment with Zessay. Milarepa’s interpretation harkened back to a differentfield, the one Marpa was tilling when Milarepa first met him, and in thiscontext the dream served as a revitalization of Milarepa’s commitment to Marpa’sguidance. It also marked a decisive repudiation of his involvement in the wholeprocess of biological reproduction, from terrestrial agriculture to his familyof origins to his future progeny. Now he pledged to follow the guidance of hisspiritual father, Marpa, and to focus all his field-plowing energies on themaster’s teachings.Milarepa’s advances in this psychospiritual training took the tangible form ofremarkable powers across all states of consciousness. He later reported that hedeveloped the ability in dreaming to fly at will, to explore the universe “fromone end to the other,” to change shapes in a multitude of different ways, and tolearn profound esoteric religious teachings. “My body could be both in flamesand spouting water,” he said. Magical powers such as these might seem highlydesirable from a worldly point of view, but for a Tantric adept they were simplythe by-products of true spiritual devotion, valuable only insofar as theycontributed to one’s progress along the Buddhist path.This same perspective is still being taught by the leader of Tibetan Buddhismtoday, Tenzin Gyatso, the fourteenth Dalai Lama (“Ocean Teacher”). The positionof Dalai Lama as political and religious leader of Tibet was instituted by theruling Mongols in the seventeenth century, and to this day the Tibetan peoplebelieve that each successive Dalai Lama is the reincarnation of Avalokitesvara,the bodhisattva of compassion. The present Dalai Lama (b. 1935) has shown greatenthusiasm for the research of Western psychologists, and in 1992 he convened agroup of researchers for a discussion about sleep, dreaming, and death.15[notes.html#ch03fn15] He listened to their description of the stages of sleep,the psychoanalytic theory of the unconscious, and the characteristics of luciddreams. When asked to describe the Tibetan view, the Dalai Lama replied:There is said to be a relationship between dreaming, on the one hand, and thegross and subtle levels of the body, on the other. But it is also said thatthere is such a thing as a “special dream state.” In that state, the “specialdream body” is created from the mind and from vital energy (known in Sanskrit asprana) within the body. This special dream body is able to dissociate entirelyfrom the gross physical body and travel elsewhere. One way of developing thisspecial dream body is, first of all, to recognize the dream as a dream when itoccurs. Then, you find that the dream is malleable, and you make efforts to gaincontrol over it. Gradually, you become very skilled in this, increasing yourability to control the contents of the dream so that it accords to your owndesires. Eventually it is possible to dissociate your dream body from your grossphysical body. In contrast, in the normal dream state, dreaming occurs withinthe body. But as a result of specific training, the dream body can go elsewhere.The Dalai Lama was effectively restating the traditional Tantric Buddhistteachings of Naropa, Marpa, and Milarepa, bringing their ideas into dialoguewith contemporary brain-mind science. His account of a “special dream body”created by the subtle manipulation of prana went well beyond the conventionalboundaries of Western psychology, though it did make sense of the magical dreampowers attributed to Milarepa and other Tibetan Buddhist saints. The Dalai Lamamade clear his disinclination to value dreams too highly—“if you ask why wedream, what the benefit is, there is no answer in Buddhism”—at the same time ashe acknowledged that some dreams (particularly vivid, recurrent ones) could beindicators of one’s spiritual status. He advocated the continuation ofmeditation practice in sleep, “otherwise at least a few hours each night will bejust a waste.” In this regard, he continued the Buddhist (and Hindu) traditionof intentionally and systematically cultivating metacognition in dreaming. Inother settings, the Dalai Lama has found it useful to instruct initiates indream incubation practices involving special prayers, sleep postures, and kushagrass (to be put under one’s mattress and pillows as agents of purification).16[notes.html#ch03fn16] Upon awakening, the initiates are told to focus on thosedreams occurring around dawn: a good dream portended a positive ritual outcome,and a bad dream was a negative omen and must be countered by reciting a mantraand scattering water around oneself. Little attention is given in this approachto the emotional or imagistic content of the dreams. The Dalai Lama, like mostBuddhists, regarded dreaming as a psychological means to a religious end.SUMMARYIn each of the three major strands of Buddhism—Therevada, Mahayana, andTantrayana—dreaming has been dismissed as a meaningless illusion and, at thesame time, venerated as a harbinger of new spiritual beginnings. Ambivalence andparadox are the hallmarks of Buddhist dream theory. Little attention is paid inBuddhism to the origins of dreaming, beyond the obvious recognition that humanmental processes are active in the formation of particular dreams. In terms offunction, Buddhism regards ordinary dreaming as a distracting nuisance, althoughmost Buddhists will grudgingly acknowledge a prophetic power in certain dreams.The highest functions of dreaming are those the Buddhists cultivate forthemselves through conscious meditation and incubation rituals. These functionsinclude reflecting on one’s current spiritual condition, receiving new sacredteachings, and practicing one’s skills at metacognition. In Buddhism, thequestion of how to interpret dreams is answered not by a waking analysis of thedream’s contents but by an enlightened awareness within the dream of itsillusory nature."},{"pageContent":"4RELIGIONS OF THE FERTILE CRESCENTSooner or later any discussion of dreams leads to a controversial question. Candreams really foretell the future? For the large majority of humankind, theanswer has always been yes. In the first three chapters we have already seenseveral instances of belief in the predictive power of dreaming: the AtharvaVeda’s catalog of medically diagnostic dream symbols, the pre-battle dreams ofChinese warriors, and the conception dreams of Queens Devananda and Maya, toname a few. In all these, we found dreaming presented as a means of expandingthe range of one’s temporal perception, allowing people to see (with varyingdegrees of clarity) important events and developments coming in the future. Aswe are about to discover, the dream reports that have survived from the ancientreligions of the Fertile Crescent are deeply concerned with predicting thefuture, even more so than in other traditions we have considered to this point.There are many reasons (political, literary, archeological) why the propheticaspect of dreaming is so strongly emphasized in this region, and much of thischapter is devoted to sorting through the multiple influences on these enigmaticdreams. But first let us dwell for a moment on the issue of precognitivedreaming and the perennial human belief in its occurrence.The idea that dreams can foretell the future seems totally alien to the modernscientific worldview. From a strictly skeptical perspective, allegedly propheticdreams are best explained as post-hoc associations of two anomalous events. Whena weird dream occurs just before an unexpected event, many people mistakenlyinterpret the dream as having predicted the event. But nothing magical is reallyat work in such cases, just a faulty application of reason. Even if the dreamappears to be a direct “hit”—for example, a dream of fire right before an actualfire—countless people are probably dreaming of fire on any given night, andchances are that once in a while someone’s fire dream will be followed by anactual fire in waking life. That is the law of averages, not prophecy orprecognition. And if this were not enough cause for doubt, we can never rule outthe possibility that the individual is simply making up the whole story.Consciously or unconsciously, people are always tempted to embellish orfabricate impressive dreams in order to enhance their social status,self-esteem, and political/religious authority. Many of the reports to beconsidered in this chapter are likely fabrications of just that kind.Still, we should be wary of allowing rationalist skepticism to dominate thestudy of dreams. Such a view has the unfortunate consequence of making the restof humanity look stupid and naïve, while inflating the intellectual superiorityof our own age. The truth is, humans have been skeptically questioning theirdreams all through history. We have already seen a high degree of criticalawareness in the Upanishads, in the Chinese philosopher Wang Chong, and in theteachings of the Buddha and several of his disciples, all of them offeringnaturalistic explanations of the origins and significance of dreams. Later inthis chapter, we hear several additional voices of caution and doubt fromancient peoples. For now, the main point is this: modern scientists are not thefirst humans ever to apply a skeptical eye toward dreaming. On the contrary, wefind in the earliest teachings of several religious traditions an emphasis onexamining the legitimacy of dreams very carefully, testing their truthfulnessand demanding clear, reasonable explanations for their effects in waking life.The Western academic dichotomy between modern rationality and premodernirrationality does not fit the data from cross-cultural and historical dreamresearch. A different orientation is required, one that does justice to therationalist thread in the dream teachings of the past while also recognizingthat throughout history most humans, including many contemporary Westerners,have believed in the prophetic potential of dreaming.A better way to approach this aspect of dream phenomenology is to view it in thecontext of the human mind’s tremendous (and entirely natural) ability to thinkahead and plan for the future. This ability is rooted in the unusually large andcomplex development of our brains. We Homo sapiens have a cerebral cortex farbigger and more densely interconnected than any other species, and one of thegreat advantages of this expanded brain network is that it enables humans tothink not only about what is immediately in front of us but also about whatmight be coming in the future, guided by present observations and past memories.The promethean, forward-gazing orientation of human consciousness is a hallmarkof our species and the basis for much of our evolutionary success.1[notes.html#ch04fn1]In light of this, the dream research question we are considering should berephrased in a more precise and empirically testable fashion. Are theanticipatory, forward-looking powers of the human mind operative only during thewaking state, or do they continue to be active during sleep and dreaming? Theprophetic dreams discussed in this chapter provide some fresh ideas about how toanswer that question.THE RISE OF CIVILIZATION IN MESOPOTAMIAAround ten thousand years ago, the valley lands of the Tigris and Euphratesrivers (Mesopotamia = “between rivers” in Greek) provided an idyllic environmentfor human settlement and growth. With temperate weather, rich soil, highlynutritious wild grasses like wheat and barley, and an abundance of large mammalscapable of domestication (e.g., goats, sheep, pigs, and cows), the region hadeverything necessary for the large-scale development of methods of foodproduction. At about the same time (ca. 8500 BCE) as humans in China wereshifting from small hunter-gatherer bands to larger agriculture-basedcommunities, the people of Mesopotamia were likewise developing impressiveskills at mass agriculture that enabled a rapid increase in population anddramatically more complex forms of social organization.As in the earliest years of China’s agricultural era, when bloody warfarebetween rival states never seemed to end, the first Mesopotamian city-stateswere also prone to constant fighting with one another. More food from crops anddomesticated animals meant that larger armies could be raised and deployed.Larger armies meant more power to control greater expanses of land, which meantmore food production, spurring the recruitment of even larger armies, and so on.Beginning around 3000 BCE in the southern portion of Mesopotamia (present-dayKuwait and Saudi Arabia), a group of people known as the Sumerians establishedseveral large city-states—Ur, Eridu, Lagash, and Uruk among them—coveringhundreds of miles of farmland. The unprecedented size and power of thesecity-states created a need for better record-keeping and quicker ways tocommunicate information from one part of the government to another. To meet thisneed, the Sumerians devised a logographic script (generally regarded as theearliest system of writing ever invented) that used simple pictures to conveybasic ideas and pieces of data. The oldest Sumerian texts that have survived areprimarily concerned with mundane bureaucratic affairs, but some of them recordthe royal declarations of various kings. Among these is a stone relief calledthe “Stele of Vultures” that includes what appears to be the first writtenreference to dreaming.2 [notes.html#ch04fn2] The stele was created by KingEanatum I (2454–2425 BCE) of the city-state of Lagash in order to memorializehis most recent military conquests. Although badly damaged, the text tells howthe god Ningirsu personally came to Eanatum and predicted his success in futurebattles. The setting in which this divine revelation occurred—“for him [Eanatum]who lies there he [Ningirsu] took his stand at his head”—implicitly identifiesit as a dream, a plausible reading given that in later Mesopotamian, Egyptian,and Greek texts dreams are regularly described as experiences in which a deityappears at the head of a sleeping person to deliver a prophetic message.Eanatum’s dream, though fragmentary and hard to decipher, has clear similaritiesto the pre-battle visions of Hindu and Chinese warriors insofar as it involved arevelation of coming events on the battlefield and a divine blessing for thosewarriors who would be victorious.Another ruler of Lagash, Gudea (ca. 2100 BCE), described his dream-inspireddevotion to the god Ningirsu in a remarkably poetic document, written on threeclay cylinders that have survived mostly intact.3 [notes.html#ch04fn3] Theprimary subject of the text was Gudea’s efforts, prompted by a striking dream,to construct an elaborately decorated sanctuary in honor of the god.In the dream, the first man—like the heaven was his surpassing size, like theearth was his surpassing size, according to his horn-crowned head he was a god,according to his wings he was the bird of the Weather-god, according to hislower parts he was the Storm-flood, lions were lying to his right andleft—commanded me to build his house; but I do not know what he had in mind.Daylight rose for me on the horizon. The first woman—whoever she may have beencoming out ahead did … a … stylus she held in her hand, a tablet of heavenlystars she put on her knees, consulting it. The second man was a warrior, he …, atablet of lapis lazuli he held in his hand, set down the plan of the temple.Before me stood a pure carrying pad, a pure brick-mold was lined up, a brick,determined as to its nature, was placed in the mold for me, in a conduitstanding before me was a slosher, a bird-man, keeping clear water flowing, amale donkey at the right of my lord kept pawing the ground for me.It is hard to know if the whole story is being presented as a dream, or if Gudeawoke up at the point when daylight appears and then had a waking vision of whatfollowed. Either way, two features are immediately notable —the dream’s complex,vivid imagery, and the king’s uncertainty about its meaning. The dream thrustGudea into a fantastic world filled with a strange mix of common objects, potentbeings, and mysterious symbols. The overwhelming nature of the experienceconfused him at first. Even though a divine figure gave him an explicit command(“build my house”), the king was unable to process the full import of what hewas seeing and hearing. He went to the goddess Nanshe (or one of herpriestesses) for help, and she readily provided an interpretation. The first manwas her brother, the god Ningirsu; the woman and the second man were the deitiesNisaba and Nindub; the brick represented the building of a temple to Ningirsu;the flowing water meant “sweet sleep will not enter your eyes because you arebusy building the house”; and the donkey indicated that “you are pawing theground impatiently like a choice foal eager to build the temple.”The text went on to describe the construction process in florid detail, and atthe end we cannot help but wonder if Gudea’s dream is genuine or a piousfiction. Either way, it is noteworthy that Nanshe’s interpretive approach wasbased on the recognition of symbols, metaphors, and metonymies in dreaming(e.g., the extraordinary size of the first man as a metaphor for the god’stranscendent power, the brick as a metonymy for the temple). This indicates thatin the earliest periods of recorded history people were already familiar withthe idea that dreaming could be meaningfully related to waking life, eitherdirectly in clear messages or indirectly through symbolic imagery and creativeword play.Not only could the Sumerian gods interpret dreams, they were also capable ofexperiencing strange prophetic dreams themselves. A poem known as “Dumuzi’sDream” told the story of Dumuzi, the god of vegetation and fertility, whosuffered a perplexing nightmare:The shepherd [Dumuzi] lay down in the southwind, to dream he lay down. Hearose—it was a dream, he arose—he rubbed his eyes, full of daze; “Bring mysister, bring! Bring my Gestinanna, bring my sister! Bring my scribe whounderstands tablets, bring my sister! Bring my songstress who knows songs, bringmy sister! Bring my little-one who knows the heart of matters, bring my sister!I will report [bur] my dream to her; in my dream, oh my sister who knows dreamswell, rushes were rising for me, rushes grew for me, one reed alone shook itshead for me, of two several reeds one was removed.”4 [notes.html#ch04fn4]The dream included several other disturbing images of decline and loss. Thestrong carryover feelings of surprise, confusion, and alarm prompted Dumuzi toseek immediate assistance in unraveling its meaning. His sister, however, couldonly give him unfortunate news: “My brother your dream is not favorable, it maynot be removed [bur].” The same Sumerian word bur has the dual connotations of(a) reporting or telling a dream; and (b) taking away or dissolving the dream’sevil contents. In this case, the latter was not possible. Gestinanna went on:“Rushes rose for you, this means bandits will rise up against you; a single reedwas shaking its head for you, this means your mother who bore you will shake herhead for you; two several reeds—one removed for you, this means I and you, oneof us will be removed.” The dream, in short, was a symbolic prophecy of Dumuzi’simpending death. The rest of the poem chronicled the shepherd god’s vainattempts to escape his fate.Another Sumerian mythological text offers a brief but lyrical meditation on thenature of dreaming generally. “Lugulbanda in the Mountain Cave” described thespiritual adventures of the warrior-king Lugulbanda, an early ruler of Uruk (andfather of Gilgamesh) who became lost and ill during a battle.5[notes.html#ch04fn5] He took refuge in a cave, where he desperately prayed tothe gods and went to sleep in hopes of a divine dream. The god Anzaqar appearedand gave Lugulbanda a series of ritual instructions which ultimately led to thehero’s salvation and transformation into a kind of deity. The preface toLugulbanda’s experience offered a fascinating insight into Sumerian ideas aboutdreaming as a phenomenon in human life:Dream—a door cannot hold it back, nor can a doorpost; to the liar it speakslies; to the truthful the truth. It can make one happy or make one lament; it isa closed archive basket of the gods. It is the beautiful bedchamber of Ninlil,it is the counselor of Inana. The multiplier of mankind, the voice of one notalive—Zangara, the god of dreams, himself like a bull, bellowed at Lugulbanda.This passage is reminiscent of King Milinda’s eloquent portrayal of thepluralism of dreams in chapter 3 [ch03.html#ch03]. The Sumerian myth spoke ofdreams as a subtle, irresistible force, a mysterious oracle whose value andtrustworthiness was directly proportional to the individual’s moral integrity inwaking life. Dreams could have many positive feelings and delightful effects,though the comment about “the closed archive basket of the gods” suggested therewere limits to what humans could understand within the dream state. Still, as“the multiplier of mankind” dreaming was recognized as an endlessly fertilesource of insight and revelation, especially in relation to the realm of thedead.GILGAMESH THE KINGThroughout Mesopotamia a king’s power was believed to emanate from the divineorder of the cosmos, and this gave heavenly legitimacy to his earthly rule.Kings were uniquely favored by the gods, and at times they were considered to begods themselves. In the king’s multiple roles as army chief, legal judge, socialservices administrator, and supreme religious official, we find one singleindividual holding the awesome responsibility of insuring the city-state’sfavorable treatment by the capricious, unpredictable, yet all-powerful gods.That so many Fertile Crescent dream reports come from kings is surely areflection of their near-total control of the social processes involved inwriting, building monuments, preserving archives, and so on. But it alsosuggests the possibility that some kings were having especially powerful dreams,dreams that reflected their intense waking-life experiences, unprecedented inhuman history, of standing at the pinnacle of massively complex societies andmediating between them and the forces of the cosmos.Such was the case, I believe, with Gilgamesh, the hero of a Sumerian poem firstrecorded in writing around 2000 BCE and later translated into several otherMesopotamian languages.6 [notes.html#ch04fn6] Verses of Gilgamesh’s adventureswere orally recited and sung for hundreds of years before that, making it one ofthe oldest known stories of all time. The epic opened with the people of thecity of Uruk crying out in distress to the gods, asking them to stop Gilgameshfrom abusing his power: “Gilgamesh does not allow the son to go with his father;day and night he oppresses the weak. … Gilgamesh does not let the young woman goto her mother, the girl to the warrior, the bride to the young groom.” Here wasthe shadow side of a king’s power—the mightier his rule, the greater hispotential for tyranny. Upon hearing of Gilgamesh’s crimes, the gods created “asecond image of Gilgamesh,” a half-human, half-animal being called Enkidu whosejob was to counteract the excesses of the king and restore peace to Uruk.Following this, Gilgamesh had a dream—not a clear revelation from a kindly deitybut rather a nightmarish scenario of helplessness, misfortune, and impotence,very much like sleep paralysis or a night terror as described by modern sleepmedicine. When the king awakened he went straight to his mother Ninsun (anotherSumerian female with expertise in dream interpretation) for help: “Gilgameshrises, speaks to Ninsun his mother to untie his dream. ‘Last night, Mother, Isaw a dream. There was a star in the heavens. Like a shooting star of Anu itfell on me. I tried to lift it; too much for me. I tried to move it; I could notmove it.’ ” Then he told her of a second dream in which a mighty ax fell fromthe sky, and he goes to it and “hugs him like a wife.” Ninsun “untied” thedreams by explaining them as both prophecies and directives for action: “Thestar of heaven is your companion. … Like a shooting star of Anu his strength isawesome. … The axe you saw is a man. You loved him and hugged him like a wife. …Go, find him, I say; this is a strong companion able to save a friend.” Herresponse to his dream followed the same basic principles used by Nanshe,Gestinanna, and other women dream interpreters of Mesopotamia in focusing onsymbols, metaphors, and metonymies that reveal prophetic information aboutfuture dangers and opportunities.Soon thereafter Enkidu arrived at the walls of Uruk and challenged Gilgamesh tosingle combat. They fought, and after a fearsome battle they suddenly reversedemotional course and became the closest of friends, just as Ninsun hadpredicted. Flush with feelings of power and confidence, Gilgamesh and Enkidu setout on a quest to Cedar Mountain to fight the legendary monster Humbaba. On theway there, Enkidu prayed to the mountain to bring the king a dream ofencouragement before the battle. Gilgamesh did not, however, receive what aMesopotamian king usually was given in response to an incubation ritual:Friend, I saw a dream—bad luck troublesome. … I took hold of a wild bull of thewilderness. He bellowed and kicked up earth; dust made the sky dark. I ran fromhim. With terrible strength he seized my flank. He tore out. … Besides my firstdream I saw a second dream. In my dream, friend, a mountain toppled. It laid melow and took hold of my feet. The glare was overpowering. A man appeared, thehandsomest in the land, his grace. … From under the mountain he pulled me out,gave me water to drink. … Friend, I saw a third dream, and the dream I saw wasin every way frightening. The heavens cried out; earth roared. Daylight vanishedand darkness issued forth. Lightning flashed, fire broke out, clouds swelled; itrained death. The glow disappeared, the fire went out, and all that had fallenturned to ashes.Before the dreams, Gilgamesh bragged that he had no fear of death; but after thedreams he was filled with dread and uncertainty. Although the text becomesfragmentary at this point, what remains is Enkidu’s attempt to bur the dream bymeans of a paradoxical interpretation: “Friend, your dream is good luck, thedream is valuable. … Friend, the mountain you saw … we’ll seize Humbaba andthrow down his shape, and his height will lie prone on the plain.” At first, itseemed that Enkidu’s reading was correct. They went forth the next day to battleHumbaba, and they succeeded in defeating him. But their victory aroused theanger of the gods, who announced their punishment in two new dreams sent toEnkidu:Hear the dream I had last night: Anu, Enlil, Ea, and heavenly Shamash were incouncil, and Anu said to Enlil: “Because … Humbaba they have slain, for thatreason the one of them who stripped the mountain of its cedar must die.” ButEnlil said: “Enkidu must die. Gilgamesh shall not die.” … Friend, I saw a dreamin the night. The heavens groaned; earth resounded. Between them alone I stood.There was a man, his face was dark. … he seized me and led me down to the houseof darkness … the house where one who goes in and never comes out again.Ironically, Enkidu’s nightmares came on the same night that Gilgamesh (whosuffered “a restless heart that will not sleep”) was able, for the first time inthe story, to lie down and sleep peacefully. The dramatic contrast in theirsleep experiences signaled a crucial shift in the epic. Now that Enkidu’s fatewas sealed, Gilgamesh’s quest changed from the standard heroic desire forglorious victory to a deeper existential yearning to understand death. The kingimmediately recognized what the dreams meant, and there was only so far he couldgo in untying it: “the dream is sound. For the living man it brings sorrow: thedream causes the living to mourn.” When Enkidu finally died, Gilgamesh sat byhis body and cried out, “What is this sleep that has taken hold of you?” Deathwas like an eternal nightmare, and the king had no hope of untying or dissolvingits effects.Still, Gilgamesh tried. He set out to find the immortal man Utnapishtim to learnhow to escape death. As he began his journey Gilgamesh asked once more fordivine guidance by means of an incubated dream: “I lift my head to pray to themoon god Sin: For … a dream I go to the gods in prayer. … preserve me!” As hedid at Cedar Mountain, Gilgamesh invoked the prerogative of Fertile Crescentkings to request heavenly dreams that would provide divine legitimacy for theiractions. Here, however, Gilgamesh was not even warned by terrifying nightmares;this time he received no dream at all. “Though he lay down to sleep, the dreamdid not come.” The silence from the gods was extremely upsetting to Gilgamesh,as shown by his violent reaction upon awakening: “Gilgamesh takes up the axe inhis hand; he drew the weapon from his belt and like an arrow. … he fell amongthem. He struck … smashing them” (the fragmented nature of this part of the textmeans we do not know the identity of “them”). This failed dream incubationsignaled another turning point in the story, as Gilgamesh was now completely cutoff from the civilization he used to rule. He was leaving his city, leaving hiskingdom, leaving the whole known world in search of the mysterious Utnapishtimand the meaning of death. The refusal of the gods to heed his dream incubationindicated the frightening extent to which Gilgamesh had lost his identity as aking. His journey was taking him beyond all bounds of religiously and sociallyordered life.Ultimately Gilgamesh’s journey failed, as we knew it must. But his frighteningdreams and mournful experiences transformed him. At the end of the story,Gilgamesh was less powerful but more human. He reentered Uruk not with atriumphant flourish but with a quiet wisdom won at the cost of much suffering.No longer a brash, out-of-control tyrant, he was still the king, and he didfinally return to his city, his people, and civilized life. “Go up, onto thewalls of Uruk,” he said in the epic’s closing verses, his words now carrying amuch deeper resonance than when he uttered these same lines at the beginning ofthe poem: “Inspect the base, view the brickwork. Is not the very core made ofoven-fired brick? Did not the seven sages lay down its foundation?” Pride in theworks of human hands—that was all Gilgamesh had left, and it was good enough.ROYAL DIVINATIONThe story of Gilgamesh spoke of a golden age lost in history, before the fall ofSumeria to the Akkadians. The dominance of the Akkadians yielded in time to theBabylonians, then to the Hittites, and then to the Assyrians. As thesesuccessive empires grew in size, complexity, and power, the status of theirkings was elevated to the point where each one became a god himself who deservedconstant worship and total obedience from his people. This royal-religiousfusion helped the kings hold their societies together by establishing a cosmiccommunal bond between people that transcended their ties of kinship to smallerfamily groups. Declaring oneself a god was, in political terms, an effectivemeans of seizing absolute authority over a population, and dreams continued toserve as a convenient source of divine approval for Mesopotamian kings needingto legitimize their powers. At the same time, we find evidence that interest indreaming gradually spread throughout Mesopotamian society to include the dreamexperiences not just of kings but of ordinary people as well. This, too, had areligious foundation. If the king became a god, then the people within hisdominion became special members of a divinized whole; they were participants ina cosmic drama that gave meaning to every aspect of their lives. In such a grandreligious context, each individual’s dreaming could become a personal means ofdiscerning divine activities.The best indication of this development comes from the Sumerian-era city-stateof Mari, which flourished in the third and early second millennium BCE along theEuphrates River (in modern-day Syria). The kings of Mari established a networkof government officials who kept track of all potentially meaningful signs,including dreams.7 [notes.html#ch04fn7] If anything was observed that seemedpolitically relevant, it was recorded and forwarded to the royal court. Severalletters from these officials to the king have been found and translated, andthey reveal a world in which dreams were widely shared, discussed, andinterpreted. Conceived as external phenomena separate from the individual’smind, the dreams of Mari’s people were systematically examined for indicationsof the kingdom’s future. Dreaming provided something like a free market ofdivine revelation, giving everyone (at least in theory) a means of contributingto the common good. Adduduri, a Mari noblewoman with official connections to thecourt, wrote letters to the king regarding dreams she had gathered from peoplein her area, and in one letter she described two particularly haunting dreams ofher own:Tell my lord: Addu-duri, your maidservant, says: since the destruction/restoration of your father’s house, I have never had a dream such as this.Previous portents of mine were as this pair. In my dream, I entered [thegoddess] Belet-ekallim’s chapel; but Belet-ekallim was not in residence.Moreover, the statues before her were not there. Upon seeing this, I broke intouncontrollable weeping. This dream of mine occurred during the night’s firstphase [during the evening watch]. I resumed dreaming, and Dada, priest ofIstar-pisra, was standing at the door of Belet-ekallim’s chapel, but a hostilevoice kept on uttering tura dagan, tura dagan (“O Dagan, return here/comeback/reconsider”?).The last part of this translation is especially uncertain, and we cannot knowfor sure what exactly Addu-duri found so ominous about the dreams. We do knowshe emphasized their unique impact on her, with the strong emotional carryoverof crying. The disappearance of the goddess and her statues from her templewould naturally be very upsetting to a religiously pious person like Addu-duri,and such an image would indicate (following a continuity approach) grave dangerand misfortune ahead. There is some evidence that the priest Dada was alreadydead at the time of the dreams, and hence his appearance might be a sign ofheavenly favor to counterbalance the ill tidings of the absent goddess. Whetheror not that is the case, an unmistakably negative tone pervaded the dreams, andAddu-duri clearly felt a sense of urgency in reporting them to the king,Zimri-Lim.We do not know what Zimri-Lim thought of her dreams, nor of the many otheromens, signs, and warnings he was hearing from his advisers. All we know is thata few years later the Babylonian ruler Hammurabi defeated Zimri-Lim in battle,and the kingdom of Mari was lost forever.Later Mesopotamian texts included a number of royal dreams in which kingsreceived clear or symbolic messages from the gods, providing them with divineinspiration, political legitimacy, and pre-battle encouragement. Very much likethe early rulers of China, the kings of Mesopotamia recited their dreams (eitheractual or fabricated) as a means of justifying and strengthening their immensepower over society. Another similarity with China is that soon after theinvention of writing, a new Mesopotamian literature arose devoted specificallyto the divination of dreams. One of the best and earliest examples of the dreambook genre came from the Babylonian Empire in the seventh century BCE.8[notes.html#ch04fn8] The book (actually a series of clay tablets) opened with aprayer of invocation to the God of Dreams, Zaqiqu (also referred to as MA.MU).Zaqiqu was capable of blessing people with good dreams and protecting them fromthe harmful effects of bad dreams. The main portion of the book listed varioustypes of dreams and their corresponding meanings. Although only a fifth of theoriginal text has survived, it still covers a wide range of dream themes,including felling trees and plants, seeing astronomical bodies, being givenobjects, seeing animals, performing a particular occupation, making objects,eating and drinking certain items, turning into various animals, standing orsitting in a specific place, carrying objects, descending to the underworld,ascending to the heavens, seeing the dead and the divine, visiting certaintemples and towns, flying, having sex, and urinating. Each dream theme or imagewas followed by an interpretation referring to the prediction of some futureevent. Some of the interpretations make no sense to modern readers, but othersfollow recognizable patterns such as punning (e.g., a dream of a raven [arbu]meant getting income [irbu]) and paradox (e.g., “If the god utters a curseagainst the man; his prayers will be accepted”).This dream book, along with many other Mesopotamian texts, referred to thefrequent occurrence of evil dreams and nightmares, which were conceived asexternal entities that attacked people in sleep. Such dreams could not beinterpreted; they could only be fought and deflected. Ritual texts known asnamburbu described various techniques for defending against nightmares and insome cases turning bad dreams into good ones.9 [notes.html#ch04fn9] The textsadvised performing the namburbu rituals immediately upon awakening, “in theearly morning, on the day after the dream was seen. … before the dream’s eviltook ahold of its victim.” One of the rituals involved telling the dream to alump of clay and then dissolving it. Other namburbu rites focused on purifyingthe space around the individual’s bed, banishing evil influences, and creating amore hospitable sleep environment.Unlike the philosopher-mystics of the Upanishads, the people of Mesopotamia leftno evidence indicating that they felt any great concern over the ontologicalquestion of dreaming. They seemed comfortable in their belief that theexperiences of sleep are real events, real in the sense of being externallygenerated, strongly felt, and consequential for the future. Sensitive to a widerange of dreaming phenomena, the Mesopotamians used their formidable skills ofobservation, analysis, and forethought to explore dreaming as a primary (thoughnot always clear or decisive) source of anticipatory knowledge.THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANSTo the south and west of Mesopotamia another mighty river civilization grew, onewhose founding was prompted by the major climate changes that transformed thepreviously lush forest lands of North Africa into a parched, windswept desertwithin a few thousand years. The humans who had roamed those forests for untoldmillennia were forced to seek a more hospitable ecosystem, and some of themmigrated north and settled along the fertile banks of the Nile River, the mostabundant and consistent source of water in the increasingly arid region. Withless and less to gain from nomadic hunting, these people began experimentingwith agriculture, and by around 6000 BCE the first evidence of systematic foodproduction appeared. As in Mesopotamia, India, and China, the development ofagriculture had an explosive effect on the early Egyptians. Their small villagesgrew rapidly in size and complexity until 3100 BCE, when the whole Nile regionwas unified into one all-powerful, densely populated, and widely interconnectedempire. The practice of writing appeared at this time (whether by independentinvention or Mesopotamian influence is not clear) to serve its primalbureaucratic purposes of record-keeping, communication, and propaganda. Flushwith power, the Pharaohs of the Old Kingdom period (2650–2134 BCE) initiatedseveral large-scale public works programs to facilitate crop irrigation, fooddistribution, and trade practices. The Pharaohs also devoted much of thedynasty’s wealth and human labor resources to the construction of immensemonuments to themselves and the gods, including the “step pyramid” of thePharaoh Djozer and the Great Sphinx of Giza.In all the surviving texts, tablets, and monuments from these early centuries ofEgyptian civilization there is not a single mention of dreams. We do not knowwhether this means that (a) the ancient Egyptians had no interest in dreams; or(b) no writings mentioning dreaming have yet been found. A comparative book likethis one inevitably favors the latter possibility. So many other early societiesvenerated their dreams that it must be true here as well, right? Maybe, maybenot. Intellectual honesty, not to mention respect for the individuality ofothers, requires constant attention to the former possibility, namely, that theArchaic and Old Kingdom Egyptians (at least those with access to writing) mightnot have regarded dreaming as a noteworthy topic. They wrote about manythings—gods and crops and battles and journeys—but nothing, it seems, aboutdreams. Why not? We may never know for certain. I suspect the divine status ofthe early Pharaohs was so secure, so integrally established in the society, andso thoroughly accepted by the people that they felt little need for any extravalidation from god-sent dreams.Eventually dreams do appear in the surviving records. During the FirstIntermediate Period (2150–2055 BCE), when drought and poor crop yields led tosevere political upheaval and internecine warfare, some of the people whobelonged to Egypt’s large class of literate officials practiced religiousrituals in which they tried to communicate with deceased relatives or friends.The texts used in these rituals are known as “Letters to the Dead,” personalmissives addressed by the living to the dead in quest of guidance andprotection.10 [notes.html#ch04fn10] The letters were probably combined withprayers, offerings, and other ritual practices to enhance their desired effect.The Egyptians had been burying their dead with great care and religious devotionfor many thousands of years, and these letters, written with touching emotionalintimacy, give us a glimpse of their personal experience of death and thedivine. Here is a letter from a man to his deceased wife:A saying by Merirtifi to Nebetotef: “How are you? Has she, the [goddess of] theWest, been taking care of you according to your desire? See, I am your belovedupon earth; fight on my behalf and guard my name! I did not muddle a spellbefore you, while I was perpetuating your name upon earth. Expel the pain of mybody! Please be beneficial to me in my presence, while I see you fighting on mybehalf in a dream. I will lay down gifts before you … when the sun rises I willset up offerings for you.”Another text alludes to a troubling dream visitation by a dead man with whom theletter-writer had conflicts in waking life. The dreamer addresses the letter tohis deceased father, begging him to intervene and prevent any moreguilt-provoking dreams from coming—“that which happened against him [the deadman], did not happen by the hand of me. … it is not I who first caused woundsagainst him. … Please, may his lord [the dreamer’s father] be protective, and donot allow him to do harm.” Brief as they are, these passages reflect a commonawareness of dreaming in both its positive and negative aspects, especially itsclose relationship with death. At least as far back as the late third millenniumBCE, ancient Egyptians were treating their dreams as a personal and potentiallybeneficial means of communicating with those who dwell in the realm of the dead.The Egyptian word resut was used in these early texts to refer to dreaming, aterm literally meaning “awakening,” with the sign of an open eye that was alsoused for other vision-related words like “see” and “be vigilant.” Thislinguistic usage reflected what other cultures have also noticed about theprominence of visual perception in dreaming. A second Egyptian word, qed, wasused to refer to “sleep” (accompanied by the sign of a bed) but could also mean“dream” when accompanied by the open eye sign. For the Egyptians, a dream wassomething one saw in sleep—something objective and external to the individual,appearing as an autonomous force that temporarily suspended the ordinaryboundaries of waking life.The first mention of dreams among the Pharaohs appeared several centuries later,during the New Kingdom era (1570–1069 BCE) that followed a devastating period offoreign invasion and occupation by the armies of Mesopotamia. Once theforeigners were ejected, the new Pharaohs set out to reestablish traditionaldynastic authority over Egypt. They were undoubtedly influenced by the religiousand political ideas of their former masters, and thus it comes as no surprise tofind at this time the first reports of dreams providing divine sanction for thePharaoh’s prowess in warfare. A stela from ca. 1500 BCE Memphis tells of PharaohAmenhotep II receiving a dream during battle from the god Amun “in order to givevalour to his son [the Pharaoh], his father Amun being the protection of hisbody, guarding the ruler.”11 [notes.html#ch04fn11] A later New Kingdom Pharaoh,Merneptah, recorded a dream (in a fragmented text) that came in the midst ofwarfare with the Libyans: “His Majesty saw in a dream, as if it were an image of[the god] Ptah standing before the Pharaoh. He was as tall as. … He said to him‘Grab hold here!’ while he was giving to him the Khepesh sword, ‘And drive awaythe heart-sickness within you.’ ”12 [notes.html#ch04fn12] These dreams broughtdivine reassurance at times when the power of the Pharaoh was being put to amilitary test. Both as political propaganda and as honest portrayals ofunderstandable anxiety (“heart-sickness”) before battle, dreaming was nowregarded as an acceptable source of guidance and legitimation for Egypt’srulers.In addition to reinvigorating Egypt’s military forces, the New Kingdom Pharaohsalso sought to restore the grand civic spirit of the earlier dynasties. One ofthe best-preserved Egyptian dream texts involved Thutmose IV (ca. 1400 BCE),whose reign was distinguished by a major restoration of the Great Sphinx atGiza.13 [notes.html#ch04fn13] Thutmose commissioned a stela to commemorate hissuccess in this holy task, including an account of the experience thatoriginally inspired him:One of these days the King’s Son Thutmose was strolling at the time of themidday and he rested in the shadow of this Great God [the Sphinx]. Slumber andsleep overcame him at the moment when the sun was at the zenith, and he foundthe majesty of this august god speaking with his own mouth as a father speaks tohis son, as follows: “Behold me, look upon me, my son Thutmose. I am your fatherHarmakhis-Khepri-Re-Atum. I will give to you my kingly office on earth asforemost of the living, and you shall wear the crown of Upper Egypt and thecrown of Lower Egypt. … To you shall belong the earth in its length and itsbreadth and all that which the eye of the All-Lord illuminates. You shallpossess provisions from within the Two Lands as well as the great products ofevery foreign country. For the extent of a long period of years my face has beenturned to you and my heart devoted to you. You belong to me. Behold, my state islike that of one who is in suffering, and all my members are out of joint, forthe sand of the desert, this place on which I am, presses upon me. I have waitedto have you do what is in my heart, for I know that you are my son and mychampion. Approach! Behold, I am with you. I am your guide.” He completed thisspeech. And this King’s Son awoke when he heard this. … He recognized the wordsof this god and he placed silence in his heart.The dream theophany of Thutmose involved a clear message of divine support andfuture good fortune. There was no Gilgamesh-like disconnect between the earthlyruler and the gods, no ambiguous symbolism needing to be untied. The Pharaohunderstood the significance of the dream at once. The Sphinx had given him abenevolent prophecy and then demanded greater respect in the form of a physicalrestoration of his statue, protecting it against the encroaching desert sands.The setting of the dream was unique in the region’s dream literature—a middaynap, precisely at the sun’s zenith, in the very shadow of the Sphinx. Thedramatic contrast between lightness and darkness created a spontaneous openingthrough which the Pharaoh shifted from a sleeping unconsciousness beside thestatue of the Sphinx to a dreaming awareness before the living presence of thegod himself. Thutmose described the experience as a kind of unintentionalincubation, with the god’s appearance serving as the creative spark for hismonumental labor to renovate the statue. The public narration of his dream wasthe strongest indication yet that dreaming was entering into the generalawareness of Egyptian society.During the New Kingdom, more and more dreams begin to appear in non-royal textssuch as hymns, poems, spells, and medical guides. Some of the hymns involvemystical kinds of experiences related to other practices of religious worship,as in these verses from the Biography of Ipuy: “It was on the day that I saw herbeauty—my heart was spending the day in celebration thereof—that I saw the Ladyof the Two Lands [Hathor] in a dream and she placed joy in my heart.”14[notes.html#ch04fn14] The medical texts, meanwhile, focused on remedies for baddreams. No interest was taken in the content or potential meaningfulness of suchdreams; they were treated as maladies to be cured, nothing more. Only oneinstance of what we have been calling a “dream book” has survived from ancientEgypt, a papyrus text found in Der el-Medineh from the reign of Ramses II duringthe thirteenth century BCE (making it the oldest surviving member of thisgenre).15 [notes.html#ch04fn15] Known as the Ramesside Dream Book, it includedthe future-oriented interpretations of 227 dream images (all addressed to maledreamers), along with spells to fight off bad dreams and a brief, badlyfragmented section describing the dreams of men who were “followers of Seth.”The book’s interpretations were consistent with the social realities of theliterate villagers known to have lived in this region, and it displayed many ofthe linguistic features we have found in other dream books—word play, punning,metaphor, cultural references, and religious symbolism. A dream of sailingdownstream was interpreted as bad because the wind usually blew upstream alongthe Nile, and thus to sail downstream was heading in the wrong direction. Adream of a large cat (possibly the god Ra) was good and signaled a largeharvest; a dream of being on top of a roof was good and meant “something will befound.” The paradoxical approach was also represented: “If a man sees himself ina dream seeing himself dead; good, it means a long life is before him.” And afew dreams included polymorphous sexual imagery: “If a man sees himself in adream after his penis has enlarged; good, it means an increase of hispossessions”; “If a man sees himself in a dream copulating with his mother whois issuing fluid; good, it means that he will be joined by his clansmen”; “If aman sees himself in a dream copulating with a pig; bad, it means that hispossessions will be emptied” (the words for “pig” and “empty” sounded similar inEgyptian).The interpretations focused on a few basic existential concerns such as health,social status, wealth, mortality, and one’s relationship to the gods. Dreamswere presented as accurate omens relating to these concerns, capable of beingunderstood in fairly reasonable terms. Once understood, the dreams served asmotivations for waking-life actions that were intended to enhance the predictedbenefits or avoid the predicted harm. The Ramesside book’s spells to protectagainst bad dreams operated on the same principles used in other Egyptianmagical texts to help people in their dealings with demons and hostile deadspirits. Different combinations of prayers, herbs, potions, amulets, andspecially designed bedposts were employed in what was apparently a widespreaddesire for protection in sleep from the dark forces of the netherworld. Fire wasan especially useful element in anti-nightmare spells, and the Ramesside bookincluded the following reassurance, cast as a dialogue between the goddess Isis(the healing mother/interpreter) and her son Horus (the nightmare sufferer): “Donot divulge that which you saw, in order that your numbness may be completed,your dreams retire, and fire go forth against that which terrifies you.”16[notes.html#ch04fn16]All in all, the Ramesside text provided a brief but impressively wide-rangingsummary of ancient Egyptian dream knowledge and interpretive practice. We haveno way of knowing if there were any other dream books circulating in Egyptiansociety, or if anyone ever actually used the interpretations contained in thisone. It may have been the solitary work of a lone genius, or it may have beenone of numerous manuals written by a larger community of interpretivespecialists. Either way, the Ramesside Dream Book stands as a monument to humancuriosity about the patterns, functions, and meanings of dreams.JEWISH INTERPRETERSDuring the third and second millennia BCE, small bands of people restlesslytraveled in and out of the Fertile Crescent lands controlled by the largerempires of Mesopotamia and Egypt, seeking a safe place to settle and developtheir own agricultural societies. According to the Tanakh (i.e., the HebrewBible, the primary collection of sacred texts of the Jewish religion), one suchgroup coalesced around a man named Abram, who in ca. 1800 BCE led his kinfolkinto Canaan, the fertile lands of the Jordan River valley. Abram (later giventhe name Abraham) told his followers about the visions and auditory revelationshe had received from the god YHWH in which a future of landed prosperity waspromised for them.17 [notes.html#ch04fn17] One of Abram’s earliest theophaniesoccurred in reply to his audacious questioning of YHWH regarding thetrustworthiness of the god’s promise—“O Lord God, how am I to know that I shallpossess it [Canaan]?” Apparently the direct voice of God in the waking state wasnot sufficiently convincing proof for Abram. In response, YHWH instructed him tosacrifice several animals, cut them in two, and lay the pieces in two opposingrows. Then, “as the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, adread and great darkness fell upon him. … [B]ehold, a smoking fire pot and aflaming torch passed between these pieces. On that day the Lord made a covenantwith Abram, saying, ‘To your descendents I give this land, from the river ofEgypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.” The eerie ritual seemed togenerate a kind of dream incubation effect for Abram, with the brilliant elementof fire bringing illumination to the frightening darkness. This vivid,otherworldly sleep theophany from YHWH gave Abram the convincing reassurance hewas seeking, with a clear message of future territorial independence.Considering Abram’s experience in the context of widely shared Fertile Crescentideas about kings, gods, and dreams, we can easily understand why it would betransformative for him and politically legitimating in the eyes of his people.The story of Abraham and his immediate descendents contained numerous referencesto highly significant dreams. Dreaming was, in this sense, a primal source ofinspiration and divine guidance during the founding era of the Jewish religion.The dreams narrated in the Hebrew Bible often included unusual twists on theclassic Fertile Crescent patterns, and these twists highlighted distinctivefeatures of the emerging Jewish tradition. For example, in Genesis 20, YHWH senta frightening dream to a king, Abimelech of Girar, warning him to stay away fromAbraham’s wife. The story demonstrated the omnipotence of the Lord by using thefamiliar Mesopotamian idea of a warning dream to benefit not just the currentking but, more important, the chosen people of YHWH. Abraham and his followersmight have appeared weak and powerless, but in dreams God was revealing thetruth of their gloriously fertile future.The dramatic theophany of Abraham’s grandson Jacob at Bethel also included dreamelements both familiar and unique:[Jacob] came to a certain place, and stayed there that night, because the sunhad set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and laydown in that place to sleep. And he dreamed that there was a ramp set upon theearth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God wereascending and descending on it! And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, “Iam the Lord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land onwhich you lie I will give to you and your descendents; and your descendentsshall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west andto the east and to the north and to the south; and by you shall all the familiesof the earth bless themselves. Behold, I am with you and will keep you whereveryou go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until Ihave done that of which I have spoken to you.” Then Jacob awoke from his sleepand said, “Surely the Lord is in this place; and I did not know it.” And he wasafraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the houseof God, and this is the gate of heaven.”18 [notes.html#ch04fn18]This story reflected a widespread Mesopotamian belief in dreams as a source ofdivine comfort in periods of difficulty and distress (Jacob was being pursued atthe time by his murderously-minded brother Esau), with a clear auditory messageof future prosperity, both geographic and genetic. Yet unlike most otherMesopotamian royal dreams, Jacob’s experience also included intensified visualand emotional elements—the dramatic image of the heavenly ramp or stairway (likethe Mesopotamian sacred towers called ziggurats) and the carryover feelings ofshock, fear, and wonder he described upon awakening. In gratitude for the dream,Jacob built a ceremonial stone pillar and pledged his lifelong faith to YHWH.What is unusual in the Mesopotamian context is not the dream revelation itself,nor the waking ritual to honor the dream. Rather, it is that such a dreamexperience could come to someone other than a king. Jacob was, as he rested hishead on the stone pillow, as remote from royal authority as a person could be.Yet God spoke to him in a dream, gave him a glimpse of divine reality, andpromised to guide and protect him in the future. Alone and powerless in thewaking world, Jacob was treated like a king by YHWH in dreaming.A large portion of Genesis is devoted to the story of Jacob’s son, Joseph, whodisplayed a personal receptivity to predictive dream visions and an uncannyskill at interpreting the dreams of others.19 [notes.html#ch04fn19] Thenext-to-youngest of twelve boys, Joseph’s dreams marked him for greatness in thefuture. In one dream he held a tall sheaf of grain that stood upright; “andbehold, your [his brothers’] sheaves gathered round it, and bowed down to mysheaf.” In a second dream, “the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing downto me.” Not surprisingly, Joseph’s older brothers were angry at the shamelessgrandiosity of his dreams, and they cast him into a pit and abandoned him to theelements. Their fratricidal actions were aimed at destroying all predictivepotential in Joseph’s night visions—“we shall say that a wild beast has devouredhim, and we shall see what will become of his dreams.”But Joseph survived, rescued by passing traders who promptly sold him intoslavery in Egypt. Falsely accused by his master’s wife, Joseph was thensentenced to the Pharaoh’s prison. In this bleak situation, Joseph had theopportunity to hear the dreams of two other inmates, the Pharaoh’s chief butlerand chief baker.20 [notes.html#ch04fn20] Both of them awoke one morning with“faces downcast,” troubled by dreams they could not interpret. When Joseph heardthis, he said, “Do interpretations not belong to God? Tell them to me, I prayyou.” This was quite a radical claim on Joseph’s part, as he explicitly linkedthe power to interpret dreams with one’s faithfulness to YHWH. For the butler’sdream of three grape vines pressed into the Pharaoh’s cup, Joseph said it meantthat in three days the butler would be restored to his former position. For thebaker’s dream of birds eating three cake baskets on top of his head, Joseph saidit meant that in three days he would be hanged by the Pharaoh, “and the birdswill eat your flesh.” The interpretations hinged on a fairly simple metaphoricalconnection (number of objects = duration of time), and they foretolddramatically different fates for the two dreamers. As the story unfolded,Joseph’s interpretations were proven correct: three days later, the butlerreturned to the Pharaoh’s court, and the baker was executed.This set the stage for Joseph’s greatest feat of dream interpretation, involvingthe Pharaoh himself and his two disturbing dreams (“in the morning his spiritwas troubled”). In the first dream the Pharaoh saw seven thin cows coming out ofthe Nile and eating seven fat cows, and in the second he saw seven thin andblighted ears of grain swallowing seven plump and full ears of grain. None ofEgypt’s magicians and wise men could interpret these two dreams until Joseph(recommended by the butler) appeared and said, “It is not in me; God will givePharaoh a favorable answer. … The dream of Pharaoh is one. … [T]he doubling ofPharaoh’s dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bringit to pass.” Joseph identified the same object-time metaphor in the Pharaoh’sdreams as in the dreams of the butler and baker. Thus the seven cows and sevenears of grain corresponded to seven years of time. The fat vs. thin contrast inboth dreams served as a metonymy for agricultural plenty vs. famine, and theswallowing of one animal or crop by the other was a vivid, disturbing image ofviolent transition. Putting these elements together, Joseph concluded that thedreams portended seven years of bountiful crops in Egypt followed by seven yearsof terrible famine. Now that Pharaoh knew this, Joseph urged him to set asideextra grain in the next seven years in order to prepare for the seven lean yearsto come. Pharaoh did as Joseph recommended, and future events proved this to bea wise course of action. When the famine years came, Joseph’s older brothersjourneyed to Egypt in desperate search for grain, and without recognizing him(Joseph had been appointed Pharaoh’s chief aide) the brothers bowed down to him,just as his dreams had predicted they would.One of the morals of Joseph’s story was that faith in YHWH brings a person thepower not just to experience dream revelations oneself but also to know how tointerpret the meaning of other people’s dreams. Dream interpretation as areligious art, as a political tool, as a community sentinel, as a means ofsurvival—all this emerged in the story of the dreamer Joseph, whose heroicadventures echoed throughout the later Abrahamic traditions.After several hundred years of increasingly harsh slavery in Egypt, the Jewishpeople escaped Pharaoh’s control and fled back to Canaan ca. 1600 BCE, led bythe charismatic visionary Moses, who was believed to have the most intimaterelationship with God of all: “If there is a prophet among you, I the Lord makemyself know to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream. Not so with myservant Moses; he is entrusted with all my house. With him I speak mouth tomouth, clearly, and not in dark speech; and he beholds the form of the Lord.”21[notes.html#ch04fn21] Dreams and visions remained valuable in this perspective,though sometimes “dark” and hard to understand. Greater emphasis was placed on ahigher and purer mode of human-divine relationship, one that was apparentlyexclusive to Moses alone. In later teachings, Moses took an even more skepticalview of dreams:If a prophet arises among you, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or awonder, and the sign or wonder which he tells you comes to pass, and if he says,“Let us go after other gods,” which you have not known, “and let us serve them,”you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or to that dreamer of dreams;for the Lord your God is testing you, to know whether you love the Lord your Godwith all your heart and with all your soul. … [T]hat prophet or that dreamer ofdreams shall be put to death, because he has taught rebellion against the Lordyour God.This was a markedly more hostile attitude toward dreams than was found in theGenesis stories. Indeed, it sounded like what Joseph’s brothers might have saidto justify themselves as they tossed their “dreamer” sibling into the pit. Thepassage reflected the broader struggle of Moses against idolatry and polytheism,and in a stroke he completely subsumed dreaming to the authority of God and hischosen leaders. Thus a fundamental polarity was established in the Pentateuch,the first five books of the Hebrew Bible and the holiest of Jewish scriptures, apolarity between dreaming as divine revelation and dreaming as tempting,misleading delusion. This tension played out in the rest of the Tanakh, withrevelatory dreams described in Judges 7 (Gideon overhearing an ominouspre-battle dream from his opponents, the Midianites), 1 Samuel 3 (the youngSamuel experiencing unintentional incubation dreams in the Temple), 1 Kings 3(the great king Solomon intentionally incubating a dream at a “high place” atGibeon), and Daniel 2 and 4 (the Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar’s twohorrifyingly true nightmares).The latter story is especially notable because Daniel, very much like Joseph,demonstrated a distinctive skill at dream interpretation, a skill that directlyaided in the Jewish people’s survival.22 [notes.html#ch04fn22] Nebuchadnezzarcalled all the kingdom’s magicians and enchanters to help him with his baddream; “his spirit was troubled, and his sleep left him.” Incredibly, the kinginsisted they describe his dream before he told them anything about it. Themagicians and enchanters replied that he asked the impossible; no one couldsatisfy such a demand. Nebuchadnezzar angrily ordered the execution of allBabylon’s wise men. This would mean the death of Daniel and the other Jewishleaders, so Daniel led his kinsmen in prayer to God for help. “Then the mysterywas revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night”; he went to Nebuchadnezzar andtold him the dream:You saw, O king, and behold, a great image. This image, mighty and of exceedingbrightness, stood before you, and its appearance was frightening. The head ofthe image was of fine gold, its breast and arms of silver, its belly and thighsof bronze, its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. As youlooked, a stone was cut out by no human hand, and it smote the image on its feetof iron and clay, and broke them in pieces; then the iron, the clay, the bronze,the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces, and became likethe chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, sothat not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the imagebecame a great mountain and filled the whole earth.Daniel interpreted the dream as a future prediction sent to Nebuchadnezzar byGod showing that his reign (symbolized by the golden head) was destined to falland disappear, to be replaced by the eternal kingdom of God. Ironically,Nebuchadnezzar responded to this interpretation not with greater humility andpiety but rather by ordering the construction of a huge “image of gold” in frontof which he forced all his people to bow down and worship. Then a secondnightmare came to him—“I had a dream which made me afraid; as I lay in bed thefancies and the visions of my head alarmed me.” This dream centered on amassive, beautiful tree which was cut down by “a watcher, a holy one” who camedown from heaven to punish Nebuchadnezzar with madness (“let a beast’s mind begiven to him”) for his faithlessness. Daniel came again to interpret the dream,telling the king it was a warning to change his ways, but unlike the Pharaoh,Nebuchadnezzar could not escape his fate. He lost his mind and his kingdom andturned into a virtual animal (he “ate grass like an ox … his nails were likebirds’ claws”) before finally recognizing God as supreme ruler of heaven andearth.Several biblical stories testified to the revelatory power of dreaming, and moreof this power was hoped for in the future, as when God promised in the Book ofJoel, “It shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on allflesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dreamdreams, and your young men shall see visions. Even upon the menservants andmaidservants in those days, I will pour out my spirit.”23 [notes.html#ch04fn23]This was a remarkably democratic appeal to the spiritual potential of allhumans. But a contrary theme ran through the Tanakh as well, one that cannot beignored if the Jewish dream tradition is to be understood in its fullcomplexity. The skepticism of Moses was repeated in several places, fromEcclesiastes 5 (“For a dream comes with much business, and a fool’s voice withmany words”) and Zecheriah 10 (“The dreamers tell false dreams, and give emptyconsolation”) to Psalms 73 (“They [wicked wealthy people] are like a dream whenone awakes, on awaking you despise their phantoms”) and 90 (“Thou dost sweep menaway; they are like a dream, like grass which is renewed in the morning”). Theprophet Jeremiah gave the most full-throated articulation of this dismissiveattitude, speaking on behalf of God:I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying,“I have dreamed, I have dreamed!” How long shall there be lies in the heart ofthe prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart,who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams which they tell oneanother, even as their fathers forgot my name for Ba’al? Let the prophet who hasa dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully.What has the straw in common with the wheat?24 [notes.html#ch04fn15]Jeremiah was speaking at a time when the Jewish people were suffering as anexiled community held captive in Babylon. Just like Moses, Jeremiah warned themnot to follow misleading and deceptive dreams but to obey the true faith, whichwas far more valuable than any dream, just as nutritious wheat was better thanempty straw. One senses that Jeremiah attacked dreaming so harshly preciselybecause a significant number of his Jewish contemporaries were in fact talkingpassionately about one another’s dreams as alternative visions of creativeaction in desperate times.25 [notes.html#ch04fn25]Over the next several centuries Jewish rabbis engaged in lengthy discussions ofthe stories in the Tanakh, trying to understand their meanings more clearly andapplying their teachings more effectively to present circumstances. From 200 to500 BCE these discussions were written down, edited, and compiled in the Talmud,a kaleidoscopic compendium of ancient perspectives on the Jewish tradition.Dreams were the focus of a particular section of the Talmud known as Berachot,chapters 55–57.26 [notes.html#ch04fn26] There is an incredible wealth ofmaterial here, but we must content ourselves with a few general observations.Revelation and nonsense. The rabbis directly debated the fundamentalmeaningfulness of dreaming, with some of them reporting heaven-sent dreams andothers questioning the epistemological reliability of dreams (“the truth is,that just as wheat cannot be without straw, so there cannot be a dream withoutsome nonsense”). In this way, the polarity from the Pentateuch was carriedforward into the rabbinic discourse of later Judaism, with one significantaddition—true dreams were now attributed to angels, and false dreams to demons.Prototypical dreams. Berachot included reports not only of precognitive dreamsbut dreams of visitations from the dead, nightmares, healing dreams, and intensesexual experiences. The Talmud is not a perfect historical record, but thesepassages suggest that at least some Jewish people were actually experiencinghighly impactful dreams (whether independently or under Mesopotamian influence,it is impossible to say) and openly wondering about their meanings. Regardingsexual dreams (particularly the troublingly erotic dreams of the demonessLilith), Rabbi Huna stated, “Even if the [seminal] emission is connected withfeelings of gratification, the dreamer is not responsible, because it was notreal sexual intercourse.”Incubation. Several rabbis warned people against the practice of dreamincubation in sacred temples (such as those of the Greek healing god Asclepius,discussed in the next chapter), and other rabbis described rituals to use inpraying for good dreams and dispelling the negative effects of bad ones. Onceagain, the Talmud presented different perspectives on a religious practice,cautioning against its misuse while encouraging responsible attempts to benefitfrom it.Interpretation. The most famous line from Berachot, “A dream which is notinterpreted is like a letter which is not read,” suggested a religiousobligation to heed the divine messages conveyed by dreams. Interpretation servedas an effective remedy for unpleasant dreams, and the recommended methods ofdeciphering a dream included the familiar ones of metaphor, puns, word play, andscriptural references. The Talmud also acknowledged the multiple possibilitiesin dreaming, as in the story of Rabbi Bana’ah, who told a dream to twenty-fourinterpreters in Jerusalem and received twenty-four interpretations in return,and each of them came true. “All dreams follow the mouth” was the rabbi’senigmatic conclusion.Many other Jewish teachers participated in this dream conversation beyond thoserepresented in the Tanakh and Talmud, and much more could be said about dreamsin Flavius Josephus’s writings about the Jewish-Roman wars (first century CE),in the allegorical commentaries on Genesis of Philo (first century CE), in therationalistic philosophical texts of Maimonides (twelfth century CE), in themystical and ethical texts of the Zohar and Sefer Hasidim (thirteenth centuryCE), in the popular interpretation manual of Solomon Almoli (sixteenth centuryCE), and in the folk and fairy-tales told among ordinary Jews up to this day.27[notes.html#ch04fn27] Throughout these many centuries, and despite frequent andviolent persecutions, a common thread of belief and practice continued to shapethe Jewish community’s attitudes toward dreaming. Like their Mesopotamian andEgyptian neighbors, the Jews believed that at least some dreams were divinemessages about the future—the people of the Fertile Crescent were essentially inagreement on that. Where the Jews differed was in their early and repeatedquestioning of the authenticity of particular kinds of dream knowledge. Theyfully understood the numinous power of dreaming, and for that very reason wereextremely wary of its potential for abuse. The skeptical voices of early Judaismwere not questioning dreams in order to question all reality, as in theUpanishads or in Buddhism. Rather, they were anxiously trying to control apotentially valuable but dangerous and unpredictable force that could threatentheir already tenuous survival as a people.SUMMARY“The Fertile Crescent” refers to a kindred group of ancient civilizations whosecreative interactions and constant warfare helped establish many of the basicreligious principles that still govern the Western world. The Sumerians,Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Egyptians, and Jews shared a deep faith indreaming as a means of communicating with the divine. Although we must beespecially cautious here since the surviving texts are so fragmentary, theavailable evidence indicates that most of these cultures taught that dreamsoriginate outside the individual, sent either by the gods or evil spirits. Veryfew people in the Fertile Crescent seem to have thought about the ontologicalquestion of waking vs. dreaming realities, and for the most part they acceptedthe idea that dreams are external entities which humans passively receive duringsleep. For these traditions, prophecy was by far the most important function ofdreaming. Dreams served as a key source of information about the will of thegods, foretelling the fates of both individuals and whole kingdoms. Many of thedreams reported from these cultures involved messages so clear and unambiguousthat no interpretation was necessary. But many other dreams included strangeimages and odd feelings, and a professional class of interpreters arose to helppeople (especially the rulers) decipher the prophetic meanings of their nightvisions. Similar to what we found among the Chinese, the dream diviners of theFertile Crescent used numerous methods to interpret people’s dreams, including asearch for puns, word play, metaphors, metonymies, cultural symbols, andreligious associations. In this broad historical context, the Jews were unusualin at least two ways: first, their patriarchs Abraham, Jacob, and Josephbenefited from the divine power of dreaming even though they were not kings;and, second, their prophets Moses, Jeremiah, and others gave voice to skepticalwarnings against dreams as deceptive fancies that can lead people away from God."},{"pageContent":"5RELIGIONS OF ANCIENT GREECE AND ROMESeveral times now we have heard stories of people performing rituals of dreamincubation, and readers may be wondering if these practices actually work. Canthe right combination of prayer, sacrifice, and sleep posture really produce arevelatory dream? Is there some kind of naturalistic explanation for theeffectiveness of dream incubation, or is it just a superstitious fantasy with nobasis in fact?If we assume that incubation is an automatic process by which humansmechanically force a divine dream to appear, then we would have to say no, thereis very little evidence to support that (if nothing else, recall Gilgamesh’smiserably failed incubation in the previous chapter). But if incubation isregarded as a conscious attempt to influence the likelihood of experiencing apowerful dream, then yes, we can find good reasons for taking it seriously. Asdiscussed in the prologue, modern research has shown that dream recall isresponsive to waking attention. If you simply formulate the conscious intentionto remember more dreams, you will be surprised at how easily your recall rateincreases. It is no great leap from that to a more focused kind of intentionrelating to a specific, emotionally salient topic. This, too, is well groundedin research showing that dream content accurately reflects the most importantemotional concerns in a person’s life. For example, if you are in the midst of apainful and messy divorce, you will be highly primed each night to dream aboutthat waking life situation. In that setting, any extra effort you make toremember dreams relating to the divorce will very likely succeed.So far, it sounds like dream incubation is an extended exercise inself-suggestion. But the rituals we are discussing push the boundaries of the“self ” well beyond its ordinary usage, to the point where psychologicallanguage seems inadequate to the descriptive task. The power of these ritualsderives not simply from their conscious intentionality but, more important, fromthe ways in which they create a space during sleep for heightened receptivity toextraordinary energies emanating from outside the usual sphere of wakingawareness. This is why dream incubation requires more than just an emotionalconcern; it also requires a change in a person’s physical sleeping conditions, areorientation of body and soul within the broader meaning-structures of thecosmos. Whether practiced in a cave, a temple, a mountain, a desert, or agraveyard, the underlying logic of dream incubation always involves a dramaticshift away from one’s normal sleep patterns and toward an unusual place wherethe powers of whatever the individual holds sacred are gathered in especiallyconcentrated form. To see an extraordinary dream, you should sleep in anextraordinary place. When combined with additional activities like fasting,sacrifice, purification, chanting, and so on, the mind-altering,dream-stimulating effects of these rituals become all the stronger, and we canbegin to appreciate why people have practiced them in so many different culturesand historical eras. Dream incubation is a species-wide spiritual practice, anaturally appealing and easily accomplished extension of the insights thatemerge in spontaneous dream experience.1 [notes.html#ch05fn1]One of history’s most striking traditions of dream incubation was the cult ofthe Greek healing god Asclepius. For many centuries, thousands upon thousands ofGreek and Roman people made sacred pilgrimages to the temples of Asclepius andslept there in hopes of a divine dream. These time-honored practices broughttogether dreaming, healing, prophecy, and wisdom and wove them into a seamless,spiritually rejuvenating whole. The widespread popularity of the Asclepian culttestifies to the high public regard of dreams in Graeco-Roman civilization, eventhough many philosophers and poets of this era expressed a deep skepticismtoward dreaming and contrasted it with the superior power of reason as a guideto truth and knowledge. By now we are familiar with this tension betweenrevelation and doubt in dreaming, having seen it in every culture considered sofar. In the case of the Greeks and Romans, we find it articulated with a vividintelligence and stirring clarity that has rarely been surpassed.MYTH AND HISTORYOne hundred thousand years ago, bands of Homo sapiens from Africa were migratingalong the Mediterranean coast and into Europe, and by 40,000 BCE they wereleaving unmistakable evidence of symbolic expression and death-related ritualsperformed in caves (e.g., in Lascaux, France).2 [notes.html#ch05fn2] We do notknow if dream incubation occurred in the caves, or if any of the spectacularwall paintings of animals, hands, geometric patterns, half-human creatures, andso forth, were directly inspired by dreams. Archeology is, and will probablyforever be, mute on those questions. But everything we know from dream research,both historical and contemporary, strongly suggests that yes, the experience ofseeing the paintings or sleeping in the caves very likely stimulated actualdreams of extraordinary power and memorability, and these dreams may well haveserved in turn as a visionary resource for new cave paintings. Some scholarshave called what happened in these caves a “creative explosion,” a revolutionaryleap in human cognitive and cultural development. From our perspective, it lookslike the natural outgrowth of a species that has learned how to intensify itspsychospiritual capacity to dream big dreams.The caves of mainland Greece were occupied by humans as far back as thirtythousand years ago. Over time these people built larger settlements, learned howto use metal, developed seafaring skills, and interacted both commercially andmilitarily with the great civilizations of the Fertile Crescent. The origins oftheir language are uncertain, but we know that by the second millennium BCE thepeople of Greece had built a powerful and sophisticated network of fortifiedcities (the first was discovered at Mycenae, hence the whole era is known as theMycenaean period). The surviving evidence of their culture indicates that itrevolved around hunting, war, and seafaring. At its height, the Mycenaeannetwork spread across the islands of the Aegean and as far east as the Turkishcoast. When this civilization collapsed around 1100 BCE (for reasons stillunknown) several centuries of social fragmentation ensued, and the written formof the Greek language was effectively abandoned. During these “dark ages,”stories began to circulate about the mighty exploits of heroic warriors whobraved fantastic dangers and fought glorious battles. Two particular cycles ofthese stories (originally sung at public festivals and much later recorded inwriting) became associated with a poet named Homer, traditionally believed to bea blind man who lived early in the first millennium BCE. The Iliad and theOdyssey recounted the adventures of an army from Greece who attacked the distantcity of Troy (the Iliad) and then embarked upon a perilous journey home (theOdyssey). Whether or not the Trojan War actually occurred, the stories sung bybards like Homer were immensely popular, testifying to a growing sense ofhistorical and cosmic self-awareness among the Greeks of this era. A closereading of the dreams in these two epics provides us with the best foundationfor understanding later Greek and Roman dream discussions.3 [notes.html#ch05fn3]The Iliad opened with a bitter argument between Agamemnon (the leader of theGreek armies fighting against Troy) and Achilles (the greatest warrior in theGreek ranks) because Agamemnon had just seized from Achilles a girl whomAchilles had won as a prize in an earlier battle.4 [notes.html#ch05fn4] Furiousat this disrespectful treatment, Achilles withdrew from the Greek army andprayed to the gods for justice. In response Zeus, the mightiest of the Olympiandeities, decided to help Achilles by sending down an “evil dream” to deceive andmislead Agamemnon. The dream took the shape of Agamemnon’s most trustworthycounselor, the aged Nestor, who stood at Agamemnon’s head to deliver a rousingmessage of heavenly encouragement for the next day’s battle. In the morning,“Agamemnon awoke from sleep, the divine voice drifting around him,” andimmediately launched his troops in a new assault on the Trojans—a battle thatZeus had already decided the Greeks would lose, to prove how badly they neededAchilles back on their side.The deception worked so well because of the expectation (familiar to anyoneinfluenced by Fertile Crescent cultures) that kings and military leaders wereregularly blessed with pre-battle dreams of divine reassurance. Agamemnon was aneasy mark for this kind of deceptive dream, though it is hard to imagine thatanyone could resist such a compellingly presented message. These early verses ofthe Iliad boldly expressed the Greek perception of a deeply troublingexistential vulnerability in dreams. What if the gods really do come to us inour dreams, but to harm us rather than help us? What if both the doubters andthe believers are wrong?That might seem like more significance than should be drawn from a dreamfabricated by a god and sent to a fictional character in a myth. We cannotforget that the Iliad was a literary creation meant to entertain an audience,and not necessarily a historical record providing objective information aboutactual people. Yet, we must also grant that Homer frequently described scenesusing remarkably accurate details about the activities in question (e.g., combattechniques, sailing skills, religious rituals, and domestic customs). Hisfictional narrative was firmly grounded in the experiential life-world of theancient Greeks, and this was true of dreaming as well. In Book 22, Achillesreturned at last to the battlefield (after the death of his best friendPatroklos) and chased the Trojan champion Hektor around the city’s mighty walls.In describing the scene Homer said, “As in a dream a man is not able to followone who runs from him, nor can the runner escape, nor the other pursue him, sohe [Achilles] could not run him [Hektor] down in his speed, nor the other getclear.” This was a direct and, in the context, quite appropriate simile based onthe pervasive human experience of chasing nightmares. Similarly, in Book 23,Homer presented a type of dream (a visitation from the dead) that we know iswidely reported by people in virtually all places and times. “The ghost ofunhappy Patroklos,” looking exactly as he did in waking, came to Achilles in adream to chide him for failing to attend to his burial rites:The ghost came and stood over his head and spoke a word to him: ‘You sleep,Achilles, you have forgotten me; but you were not careless of me when I lived,but only in death. Bury me as quickly as may be, let me pass through the gatesof Hades.In the dream Achilles promised he would do so, and he asked Patroklos to stay:“But stand closer to me, and let us, if only for a little, embrace, and takefull satisfaction from the dirge of sorrow.” So he [Achilles] spoke, and withhis own arms reached for him [Patroklos], but could not take him, but the spiritwent underground, like vapour, with a thin cry, and Achilles started awake,staring, and drove his hands together, and spoke, and his words were sorrowful:“Oh, wonder! Even in the house of Hades there is left something, a soul and animage, but there is no real heart of life in it.”This is a classic visitation dream in terms of its perceptual intensity,emotional arousal, and carryover impact on waking consciousness. The pattern wehave identified in other cultural and historical contexts is displayed here infull flower, indicating that at least by the time of Homer (and probably muchearlier than that) the ancient Greeks were familiar with the experience of dreamvisitations from the dead. The message Achilles received was more reliable thanAgamemnon’s, although it revealed a much bleaker vision of reality that onlyintensified his sadness and despair. Yet, it was not an evil dream. On thecontrary, it became a turning point in Achilles’ mourning process, honestlyexpressing the awful depth of his feelings of loss, feelings that afame-seeking, honor-conscious warrior might not otherwise want to acknowledge.The dreams presented in the Odyssey were also notable for some interestingfeatures of psychological verisimilitude that enhanced their effectiveness asliterary devices.5 [notes.html#ch05fn5] Early in the story Telemachus,Odysseus’s son, secretly left home to seek news of his father. Penelope, hismother and Odysseus’s wife, was terrified when she discovered that Telemachushad left. But in her sleep that night her divine patron, the goddess Athena,sent a dream in the trustworthy form (eidolon) of Penelope’s sister, who stoodat her head and told her that Telemachus was protected by the gods and wouldreturn home safely. “‘Courage!’ the shadowy phantom reassured her. ‘Don’t beoverwhelmed by all your direst fears.’ ” In its hopeful and uplifting propheticmessage Penelope’s dream could fairly, and without embarrassment, be called awish-fulfillment—“Icarios’s daughter [Penelope] started up from sleep, herspirit warmed now that a dream so clear had come to her in darkest night.” Morethan any other character in either epic, Penelope drew deeply from the well ofdreaming, where she found the emotional strength and intellectualresourcefulness to face the challenges of her exceedingly dire waking-lifesituation. Odysseus had been gone for twenty years, she was the captive of ahorde of men (the “suitors”) who were demanding she choose one of them as hernew husband, and she had discovered they were secretly plotting to murder herson. When Odysseus returned in the disguise of a beggar, Penelope requested aprivate audience with the old wanderer to see if he had any news of her husband.The ensuing dialogue between the long-suffering queen and the beggar-in-disguisewas in many ways the most dramatic scene of the whole story, and at its heartwas a dream. Before parting for the evening, Penelope said,My friend, I have only one more question for you …[P]lease, read this dream for me, won’t you? Listen closely …I kept twenty geese in the house, from the water troughThey come and peck their wheat—I love to watch them all.But down from a mountain swooped this great hook-beaked eagle,Yes, and he snapped their necks and killed them one and allAnd they lay in heaps throughout the hall while he,Back to the clear blue sky he soared at once.But I wept and wailed—only a dream, of course—And our well-groomed ladies came and clustered round me,Sobbing, stricken: the eagle killed my geese. But downHe swooped again and settling onto a jutting rafterCalled out in a human voice that dried my tears,“Courage, daughter of famous King Icarius!This is no dream but a happy waking vision,Real as day, that will come true for you.The geese were your suitors—I was once the eagleBut now I am your husband, back again at last,About to launch a terrible fate against them all!”So he vowed, and the soothing sleep released me.[Odysseus replied] “Dear woman, … twist it however you like,Your dream can mean only one thing. OdysseusTold you himself—he’ll make it come to pass,Destruction is clear for each and every suitor;Not a soul escapes his death and doom …”[Penelope responded] “Ah my friend, …Dreams are hard to unravel, wayward, drifting things—Not all we glimpse in them will come to pass …Two gates there are for our evanescent dreams,One is made of ivory, the other made of horn.Those that pass through the ivory cleanly carvedAre will-o’-the-wisps, their message bears no fruit.The dreams that pass through the gates of polished hornAre fraught with truth, for the dreamer who can see them.But I can’t believe my strange dream has come that way,Much as my son and I would love to have it so.Here as elsewhere in the story, Odysseus displayed a remarkable ability tocreate his own destiny, bending fate to his purposes. His confidentinterpretation of the positive prophetic symbolism of Penelope’s dream (themountain eagle killing the geese meaning that Odysseus will kill the suitors)came true because he made it come true. A short time later he did indeed destroythe suitors, thereby reclaiming his throne, his honor, and his wife. Modernscholars have traditionally regarded this scene as another example of Odysseus’scunning intelligence, in contrast to the queen’s hapless confusion. I prefer adifferent reading, however, one that credits Penelope with an equally cunningawareness of the beggar’s true identity. In my view, Penelope knew perfectlywell that it was Odysseus standing before her, refusing to reveal himself toher. She fabricated the dream of the twenty geese in order to test her husband’sunderstanding of what she had endured on his behalf, and he failed the test(there were not 20 suitors, but 108; the number 20 more likely referred to thenumber of years of their marital separation). Odysseus may have gone on todefeat the suitors, but only by placing his desire for vengeance higher than hislove and regard for Penelope.Either way, Penelope’s speech about the “two gates” of dreams stands as abrilliant sentinel in the history of Greek dream speculation. Although we stilldo not fully understand the significance of horn and ivory as contrasting dreamsubstances (perhaps ivory is more opaque than horn, so horn is easier to seethrough), the mysterious image of the two gates illuminated a fundamentalduality of oneiric experience: some dreams are nonsense and have no consequencein our lives, whereas others have the potential to reveal meaningful truths, butonly “for the dreamer who can see them.” As a theory of dreaming, this reflecteda cautious, well-considered balance between skepticism and hope, vain fantasyand genuine insight. The haunting spirit of Penelope’s words echoed throughoutclassical Greek philosophy and literature, where the revelation vs. deceptiondichotomy branched out in several creative directions.The final chapter of the Odyssey made a brief reference to a different vision ofthe geography of dreaming, when the ghosts of the suitors slaughtered byOdysseus were led by the god Hermes on their final journey:And Hermes the Healer led them on, and down the dankmoldering paths and past the Ocean’s streams they wentand past the White Rock and the Sun’s Western Gates and pastthe Land of Dreams (demos oneiron), and they soon reached the fields of asphodelwhere the dead, the burnt-out wraiths of mortals, make their home.Also translated as “Village of Dreams” or even “People of Dreams,” this was thelast stop on the way to the final residence of the dead. Physically speaking,dreams were located far, far beyond this world. They came from a place asdistant from ordinary life as one could go without actually dying.From Homer we learn where dreams dwell. From Hesiod we are told when they wereborn. In the Theogony, Hesiod, an eighth-century-BCE poet and possiblecontemporary of Homer, gave dreams a parentage and mythological family oforigin.6 [notes.html#ch05fn6] Hesiod’s poem was the earliest Greek creationstory, telling “how the gods and earth arose at first,” and dreams appearedfairly early in the process. Chaos was alone at the beginning, and then thereappeared Gaia the Earth, Tartarus the misty underworld, and beautiful Love.“From Chaos came black Night [Nyx],” followed by a whole host of incestuous,violent, and quarrelsome gods and goddesses. After the “most terrible of sons,”Kronos, castrated Ouranos (his father and the god of heaven) while making loveto Gaia, we learn that “Nyx bore frightful Doom and the black Ker [an evilfemale spirit], and Death, and Sleep, and the whole tribe of Dreams [Oneiroi].”Somewhat like the Homer’s demos oneiron, Hesiod’s Oneiroi suggested a vaguepersonification of dreaming, a tendency to take humanly recognizable form,perhaps even to the extent of generating a sense of community among the dreamsthemselves. But Hesiod, even more than Homer, emphasized the primal darkness ofdreaming, the frightening kinship with the most destructive and hostile forcesof the cosmos. Long before humans were created, prior even to the appearance ofZeus and the Olympian gods, dreams were spontaneously conceived in a primordialera of seething aggression, polymorphous sexuality, and reality-bendingelemental conflicts.CLASSICAL PHILOSOPHYAfter Hesiod and Homer’s time, the city-states of the Greek mainland andsurrounding islands grew rapidly in power and prosperity, spreading theirinfluence once again as far east as the shores of Asia Minor. Over the nextseveral centuries, the writings of these people became increasinglysophisticated, self-reflective, and philosophically minded. Everything in natureand human experience became subject to a probing rational analysis that soughtknowledge of the fundamental laws of the cosmos. Dreams were brought into thisprocess both as an object of analysis and, more controversially, as a guide inthe reasoning process itself. An early version of physiological dream theoryappeared in a fragment from the works of Heraclitus of Ephesus (sixth centuryBCE) in which he said that, “for those who are awake there is a single, commonuniverse, whereas in sleep each person turns away into his own, privateuniverse.”7 [notes.html#ch05fn7] By sharply distinguishing the reality of wakingand the reality of dreaming, Heraclitus removed the latter from the realm ofmythological power and relocated it within a naturalistic, purely subjectiveframework. A different approach was taken by Parmenides of Elea (fifth centuryBCE) who wrote treatises on logic that were directly inspired by his experiencesas an Iatromantis, a healer and prophet who slept on animal skins inside ofcaves.8 [notes.html#ch05fn8] In Parmenides we find a philosophical elevation ofdreaming as a kind of oracle of inspiration, in contrast to Heraclitus’sphilosophical domestication of it as a private sphere detached from socialreality.A similar dynamic can be seen in the philosophical lineage of Socrates (470–399BCE), Plato (427–347 BCE), and Aristotle (384–322 BCE). They were all denizensof Athens, a city-state that for several centuries enjoyed a spectacularflowering of intellectual, literary, and artistic creativity. Socrates was themost renowned philosopher of his day, a skilled public debater and tricksterishcritic of conventional thinking. He left no writings of his own, and our bestknowledge of his teachings comes through the dialogues written by his student,Plato. We know of at least two dreams Socrates reportedly experienced, both ofwhich were told in the final days of his life as he awaited execution by theAthenian authorities, convicted of the crimes of corrupting the city’s youth anddisrespecting the gods. The dialogue known as the Crito opened with Socratessleeping in his prison cell, while the Athenian authorities awaited the arrivalof a religiously ceremonial boat that would signal the time for his execution.9[notes.html#ch05fn9] His friend, Crito, was sitting there when Socrates awokejust before dawn, and Socrates immediately declared that the boat in questionwould not arrive that day:Crito: What makes you think that?Socrates: I will try to explain. I think I am right in saying that I have to dieon the day after the boat arrives?Crito: That’s what the authorities say, at any rate.Socrates: Then I don’t think it will arrive on this day that is just beginning,but on the day after. I am going by a dream that I had in the night, only alittle while ago. It looks as though you were right not to wake me up.Crito: What was the dream about?Socrates: I thought I saw a gloriously beautiful woman dressed in white robes,who came up to me and addressed me in these words: “Socrates, ‘To the pleasantland of Phthia on the third day thou shalt come.’ ”Crito: Your dream makes no sense, Socrates.Socrates: To my mind, Crito, it is perfectly clear.At one level this was the most common (and dubious) of dream types, the symbolicomen of death. Crito’s confusion may be owing to his surprise that so eminent aphilosopher as Socrates would give credence to a common folk belief, butSocrates was content with his own comprehension of the dream and felt no need toexplain it further. Strangely, the words spoken by the beautiful woman (no otherinformation is known about her) were quoted from the Iliad (9.363), from apassionate speech given by Achilles when he was planning to abandon the TrojanWar and return to his home in Phthia. As it turned out in the Iliad, Achillesnever made it back home. He returned to the battle, fought heroically, and died.Socrates was about to die for a very different cause, that of truth andspiritual freedom. His dream seemed to suggest that death would bring him to anultimate spiritual paradise, a kind of transcendental homecoming. Thephilosopher would achieve what the warrior could not.Throughout his life Socrates used the powers of rational analysis and criticalquestioning to guide people to the very edge of their intellectual andpsychospiritual development. Crito’s confusion was a common experience among hisstudents, and in another dialogue Socrates referred to such epistemologicaluncertainty as the birthplace of philosophical inquiry itself.10[notes.html#ch05fn10] A bright young man named Theaetetus, for whom thisdialogue was named, was brought to Socrates for inspection. The master askedTheaetetus one perplexing question after another, and the young man quicklyfound himself thoroughly befuddled and amazed at how little he really knew.Socrates said that was a good thing: “This sense of wonder is the mark of thephilosopher. Philosophy indeed has no other origin.” Socrates then went on toask Theaetetus a version of what we are calling the ontological question ofdreaming:Socrates: Have you not taken note of another doubt that is raised in thesecases, especially about sleeping and waking?Theaetetus: What is that?Socrates: The question I imagine you have often heard asked—what evidence couldbe appealed to, supposing we were asked at this very moment whether we areasleep or awake, dreaming all that passes through our minds or talking to oneanother in the waking state?The wonder-struck youth admitted that he could not find a way to sharplydistinguish the two. You might think you are awake, but it is always possiblethat you are in fact experiencing a highly realistic dream. Socrates left thisvertiginous question without further comment, as he was interested less inanswers than in opening people’s minds to free inquiry. Socrates’ playful,mischevious practice of questioning people regarding the underlying principlesof their beliefs (his students enjoyed the process, most of the Athenian elitedid not) had a profoundly wonder-working effect, decentering his conversationpartners from their customary perspectives and recentering them within a broaderperspective of conceptual possibility. Socrates spoke of himself as a “midwife”whose concern was “not with the body but with the soul that is in travail ofbirth.” He helped people open themselves to the pursuit of wisdom, though he didnot claim to provide them with wisdom itself.Eventually the ship arrived, and the day of Socrates’ execution was set. In thedialogue Phaedo, he received one last prison visit from his distraught friends,who were startled to discover that their teacher has been spending his finalhours of life writing poems based on Aesop’s fables for children.11[notes.html#ch05fn11] Why, his friends asked, was he engaged in such a frivolousactivity? He answered as follows:I did it in the attempt to discover the meaning of certain dreams, and to clearmy conscience, in case this was the art which I had been told to practice. It islike this, you see. In the course of my life I have often had the same dream,appearing in different forms at different times, but always saying the samething, “Socrates, practice and cultivate the arts.” In the past, I used to thinkthat it was impelling me and exhorting me to do what I was actually doing; Imean that the dream, like a spectator encouraging a runner in a race, was urgingme on to do what I was doing already, that is, practicing the arts, becausephilosophy is the greatest of the arts, and I was practicing it. But ever sincemy trial, while the festival of the god has been delaying my execution, I havefelt that perhaps it might be this popular form of art that the dream intendedme to practice, in which case I ought to practice it and not disobey. I thoughtit would be safer not to take my departure before I had cleared my conscience bywriting poetry and so obeying the dream.As in the Crito, Socrates’ friends were so baffled by this dream-talk that theycould not even comment, and the conversation moved to other topics. But, fromour perspective, perhaps we can better appreciate what Socrates was trying tosay. As he prepared to die (the Phaedo ended with his suicide) he wanted toleave his friends with one last moment of philosophical wonder, one final sparkof encouragement to remain open to the new, the unexpected, the surprising. Herevealed to them his experience of a lifelong recurrent dream which he hadalways interpreted, quite agreeably, as an affirmation of his vocation as aphilosopher. But now, facing the imminence of death, Socrates felt the need toquestion that interpretation, raising the possibility that his whole life hadbeen a mistake. Socrates took this on as his final challenge, and he approachedit with characteristic playfulness and good cheer. By reinterpreting hisrecurrent dream and responding to it with this simple, childlike practice,Socrates illustrated a kind of transcendent philosophical spirit that couldfreely question its own self-understanding without anxiety or despair. His finalwords, after draining a cup of poison hemlock, were these: “Crito, we ought tooffer a cock to Asclepius. See to it, and don’t forget.” The most eminent ofphilosophers ended his life by humbly offering thanks to the god who heals withdreams.Plato was twenty-eight years old when Socrates was condemned to death by thecitizens of Athens, and the young man’s philosophical development was profoundlyshaped by what he angrily perceived to be the moral, political, and religiousfailings of the Athenian state. Uncertainties remain over how many of Socrates’words in the Dialogues came directly from him and how many from Plato. I sensethat the passages about dreams we have just discussed are more reflective ofSocrates’ ideas, and the dream references in Dialogues like the Republic, theTimaeus, and the Laws are more likely the ideas of Plato. That, at any rate, isthe basis of the following analysis.12 [notes.html#ch05fn12]The Republic, arguably the central work of Plato’s mature thought, presented asweeping vision of social perfection in which “philosopher-kings” were carefullytrained from birth to develop the intelligence, skill, and fortitude they wouldneed as adults to rule the state wisely and justly. In Plato’s utopia the primevirtue was rationality, and he stressed the importance of using reason to driveout deluded thinking and superstitious beliefs. He criticized Homer on thisscore, particularly the Iliad passage in which Agamemnon was deceived by theevil dream sent by Zeus: “Though there are many other things that we praise inHomer, this we will not applaud, the sending of the dream by Zeus toAgamemnon.”13 [notes.html#ch05fn13] According to Plato, reason teaches that Godmust be simple and true, not an irascible liar. Thus any stories suggestingotherwise were banned from the Republic.One section of the dialogue examined the advantages and disadvantages ofdifferent forms of government, and most interesting from our perspective was theway Plato developed a psychological analysis in tandem with his politicalanalysis. Each type of political state had its matching type of personality, ananalogous form of psychological self-government. When Plato turned his analysisto the worst type of state and man, that is, the tyrannical, he mentioned sleepand dreaming in order to illustrate the lawless instincts and desires thatdominated in this condition. These awful appetites dwell within all humans, asproven by the natural, species-wide phenomenon of dreaming:[These desires] are awakened in sleep, when the rest of the soul, the rational,gentle, and dominant part, slumbers, but the beastly and savage part, repletewith food and wine, gambols and, repelling sleep, endeavors to sally forth andsatisfy its own instincts. You are aware that in such case there is nothing itwill not venture to undertake as being released from all sense of shame and allreason. It does not shrink from attempting to lie with a mother in fancy or withanyone else, man, god, or brute. It is ready for any foul deed of blood; itabstains from no food, and, in a word, falls short of no extreme of folly andshamelessness. … There exists in every one of us, even in some reputed mostrespectable, a terrible, fierce, and lawless brood of desires, which it seemsare revealed in sleep.14 [notes.html#ch05fn14]From the vantage of Plato’s philosophy, dreaming appeared as a dangerouspsychological rebellion, a temporary defeat for the legitimate authorities ofreason and a brief but savage reign of terror by the animal instincts. Incontrast to Socrates’ delight in dreaming, Plato was plainly scared of it. Thepluralistic nature of dreams took on a much darker hue in his vision, and hebrooded on their socially disruptive and taboo-violating potential, theirhideous revelation of our primitive roots, and their total opposition to reason.The worst thing one could do, either politically or psychologically, was toallow these desires any influence over waking life: “The most evil type of manis … the man who, in his waking hours, has the qualities we found in his dreamstate.”15 [notes.html#ch05fn15]Plato did, however, grant the possibility that someone with extraordinaryphilosophical training could make use of insights gained during the condition ofsleep:But when, I suppose, a man’s condition is healthy and sober, and he goes tosleep after arousing his rational part and entertaining it with fair words andthoughts, and attaining to clear self-consciousness, while he has never starvednor indulged to repletion his appetitive part, so that it may be lulled to sleepand not disturb the better part by its pleasure or pain, but may suffer that inisolated purity to examine and reach out toward and apprehend some of the thingsunknown to it, past, present, or future, and when he has in like manner tamedhis passionate part, and does not after a quarrel fall asleep with anger stillawake within him, but if he has thus quieted the two elements in his soul andquickened the third, in which reason resides, and so goes to his rest, you areaware that in such case he is most likely to apprehend truth, and the visions ofhis dreams are least likely to be lawless.16 [notes.html#ch05fn16]This passage indicated that it was not dreaming per se that troubled Plato butrather the beastly passions they unleashed. In words that sound remarkably likea philosopher’s ritual of dream incubation (with an almost Buddhist, middle-pathapproach to the preparation of mind and body), Plato outlined the possibility ofdreaming guided by pure reason, the divine soul liberated from the sleeping bodyand capable of gaining true insight and trans-temporal knowledge. Hisdescription of a sleep state of “clear self-consciousness” recalls both Hinduand Buddhist teachings that likewise equated a person’s psychospiritual puritywith heightened clarity and control of dreaming. The difference is that Platonever followed up on his own suggestion. He left it open as a logicalpossibility within his philosophy, but apparently never tried to apply it inpractice. Ultimately, Plato could not find a place in his vision of the worldfor oneiric experience.17 [notes.html#ch05fn17]Nor, really, could his student, Aristotle. Like Plato, Aristotle acknowledgedcertain potentials in dreaming that, if taken seriously, would seem to warrantmuch more investigation; and, like Plato, he left no evidence that he everengaged in such investigations. Aristotle wrote two short treatises on thesubject, De Insomniis (On Dreams) and De Divinatione per Somnum (On Prophesyingby Dreams), in which he analyzed the basic features of sleep and dreaming, andexplained them in terms of the natural laws of physics.18 [notes.html#ch05fn18]In De Insomniis, he observed that when humans are sleeping the faculties ofsense perception and rational thought cease their normal operation. Therefore,dreams cannot arise from sense perceptions or the intellect, which inAristotle’s philosophy were the only faculties by which humans acquired trueknowledge. He argued that dreams were, in fact, merely echoes of senseperceptions from daily life. What appeared to be external objects were reallyinternal representations of past experiences, particularly those of unusualemotional intensity:We are easily deceived respecting the operations of sense-perception when we areexcited by emotions, and different persons according to their differentemotions; for example, the coward when excited by fear, the amorous person byamorous desire; so that, with but little resemblance to go upon, the formerthinks he sees the object of his desire; and the more deeply one is under theinfluence of emotion, the less similarity is required to give rise to theseillusory impressions.In Aristotle’s rendering of human psychology, the state of sleep allows apassion-driven hyper-connectivity to generate internal images that reflect thedistinctive emotional concerns of each individual’s waking life. His formulationof this basic idea has itself echoed through the following centuries of Westerncivilization, eventually shedding its ties to his outdated notions of humananatomy but still preserving the core insight that dreaming is a natural productof the mind’s activities during sleep with meaningful connections to theindividual’s waking life.In De Divinatione per Somnum, Aristotle evaluated claims regarding divine dreamsforetelling the future. He was skeptical of such claims because they violatedhis elitist sense of the Athenian social and intellectual hierarchy: “It isabsurd to combine the idea that the sender of such dreams should be God with thefact that those to whom he sends them are not the best and wisest, but merelycommonplace persons.” Nevertheless, he went on to analyze prophetic dreams interms of three categories: causes, tokens, and coincidences. Dreams maysometimes be the cause of future actions, when “the movements set up first insleep … prove to be starting-points of actions to be performed in the daytime.”Aristotle said that dreams could also be tokens of the future, and here he gavethe example of dreams revealing the onset of an illness before the individualhas become aware of it. Sounding much like Plato, he explained these dreams byreference to the liberation of reason during sleep. In the sensory withdrawaland quietude of sleep, the mind is capable of perceiving subtle movements,stirrings, and beginnings that are ordinarily lost in the bustle of daily life:“It is manifest that these beginnings must be more evident in sleeping than inwaking moments.”Aristotle concluded his analysis by dismissing most so-called prophetic dreamsas mere coincidences in which people mistakenly perceive a connection between adream and an external event. In so doing he returned dreaming to the realm offolk belief, a safely remote location from which it had no further influence onhis philosophy. Unfortunately, Aristotle never explored the intriguingpossibilities raised by his first two categories. If the internal movements ofsleep and dreaming can be the “starting points” and causes of waking actions,what does that imply about the intentionality and autonomous creativity of thenonrational forces within us? If the liberation of reason in sleep enables it togain such potentially valuable knowledge, what is the full extent of thisoneiric ability? These are questions deserving deeper and more sustainedattention than Aristotle was able or willing to give them. To his credit,however, he did leave open the possibility that people could find worthwhileinsights in their dreams if they learned how to filter out the distortinginfluences of their emotions in order to perceive the underlying psychologicalmovements and forms. To become a “skillful interpreter,” Aristotle said, oneshould develop the “faculty of observing resemblances,” that is, the ability to“rapidly discern, and at a glance comprehend, the scattered and distortedfragments of such forms.” In this way one could, with the blessings ofAristotle’s rationalist philosophy, practice a naturalistic approach to dreaminterpretation.DREAMING IN THE POLISThe philosophical teachings of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle were part of aculture-wide conversation about the nature and meaning of dreams. Everywhere welook in classic Greek culture—in drama, poetry, history, and medicine—we finddreaming represented both as a valuable source of heavenly knowledge and as afrightening portal into the nether regions of the psyche and the cosmos.Oedipus Rex by Sophocles (fifth century BCE) displayed on stage the tragic fateof a man doomed by the horrors of irrational passion.19 [notes.html#ch05fn19]The play tells the mythological story of Oedipus, the righteous and upstandingking who discovers the shocking truth that he murdered his father and marriedhis mother. At one point in the play, Oedipus’s wife/mother Jocasta mentions thefrequency of son-mother incest dreams, and she says not to worry about them: “Asto your mother’s marriage bed—don’t fear it. Before this, in dreams too, as wellas oracles, many a man has lain with his own mother. But he to whom such thingsare nothing bears his life most easily.” The audience for Sophocles’ play knewthat Oedipus was, without consciously knowing it, living out this commonincestuous dream in waking reality. Jocasta’s dismissive attitude thus becomesan ironic reminder that such dreams could be truthful revelations of the awfuldepths of human desire.In Hecuba, by Sophocles’ contemporary Euripides, the play’s heroine experiencedan intensely frightening nightmare portending the death of her children, movingher to exclaim,What apparition rose, what shape of terror stalking the darkness? O goddessEarth [potnia Chthon] womb of dreams [meter oneiron] whose dusky wings trouble,like bats, the flickering air! Beat back that dream I dreamed, that horror thatarose in the night.20 [notes.html#ch05fn20]This unsettling passage presented a geneology of dreams different from Hesiod’sbut equally as dark and forbidding. Dreams were born of the primordial femalepower of the earth, the goddess Chthon, whose oracle at Delphi was stolen fromher by Apollo. In retaliation, she created dreams: “And so in anger [thegoddess] bred a band of dreams which in the night should be oracular to men,foretelling truth. And this impaired the dignity of Phoebus [Apollo] and of hisprophecies.”21 [notes.html#ch05fn21] The revelatory, truth-telling power ofdreams was, in this story, the product of Chthon’s vengeful effort to spread thepower of prophecy beyond the exclusive control of Apollo. Euripides offered amythic vision of dreaming as a divinely inspired but conflict-ridden gift shared(at least potentially) by all humankind.Aeschylus, the third great tragedian of classical Greece, included a deeplydisturbing nightmare at a pivotal moment in the Oresteia, the trilogy of playstelling the story of the bloody downfall of the mythic hero Agamemnon and hisfamily’s “House of Atreus.” Agamemnon’s victory in the Trojan War was purchasedat a terrible price: he had to kill his daughter, Iphigenia, as a sacrifice togain the gods’ favor. When Agamemnon returned home after the war his wifeClytemnestra slew him for that crime, and then several years later their sonOrestes (with the help of his sister Electra) murdered Clytemnestra for killinghis father. In the middle play (The Libation Bearers), before Orestes has takenhis vengeance, the Chorus reveals to him a bizarre recurrent dream experiencedby his mother: Clytemnestra gives birth to a snake, wraps it in blankets like ababy, and puts it to her breast to nurse; but the snake bites her nipple anddraws blood.22 [notes.html#ch05fn22] Upon hearing this Orestes cries,This is not meaningless! … [M]y prayer, by this land, by my father’s grave, [isthis]: may this dream find fulfillment for me! I judge it will, too; all of itfits. For if the snake came from the same place I did, and wore my swaddlingclothes, and sucked the breast that gave me sustenance, mixed the dear milk withclots of blood, and she was terrified at what had happened—then, it must be sothat, as she raised this fearful monster, she must die violently! For I thatbecame that very snake will kill her, even as the dream has said.The Greek audience of Aeschylus’ play would know from their familiarity withHomer that dreams are not always trustworthy oracles and that strong emotionscan be confusing factors in their interpretation. But Orestes shows no suchmisgivings. He instantly accepts the dream as a favorable prophecy that fitswith his gathering plan to kill his mother. The perverse sexual imagery of thedream reflects the unholy horror of what Orestes is contemplating. That is whyhe doesn’t pause over the alarming detail of his own identity being symbolizedby a monstrous serpent—he knows this is what he must become to fulfill hissacred duty to his father.The poet Pindar (522–443 BCE) told a story in The Olympian about a brave andadventuresome young man named Bellerophon, son of the god Poseidon and his humanwife Eurynome, whose most famous feat depended on a magical dream incubation.23[notes.html#ch05fn23] Bellerophon’s greatest desire was to possess the wingedhorse Pegasus, a marvelous creature born from the blood of the monster Gorgonafter being slain by Perseus. An old wise man told Bellerophon that if he wantedto capture Pegasus he should go to the temple of Athena and sleep there in hopeof a revelatory dream. The young man did as advised, and while he slept next tothe temple’s altar the goddess appeared before him holding a golden object.“Asleep?” Athena asked him. “Nay, wake, here is what will charm the steed youcovet.” Bellerophon awoke in amazement to find a horse’s bridle made entirely ofgold on the floor beside him. He immediately set out in search of Pegasus. Whenhe finally found him, the horse willingly allowed the young man to strap on thebridle and ride him. From thenceforth Pegasus and Bellerophon became a unitedheroic team. This was a very popular story among the ancient Greeks, and thetransformation of the golden bridle from dreaming to waking object reflected alively sense of potential interpenetration between the two states of being. As adivine gift that bridged the dreaming and waking worlds, the bridle had thespecial power to bond Pegasus and Bellerophon in peaceful mutuality, withoutviolence or coercion.Turning to a mode of discourse more akin to the social sciences of today,numerous dream reports were included in the Histories of Herodotus (484–425BCE).24 [notes.html#ch05fn24] Known both as the “Father of History” and the“Father of Lies,” Herodotus wrote detailed descriptions and analyses of hisextensive travels across the Mediterranean and into Mesopotamia, and he providedadditional evidence of different cultural beliefs about dreaming. For example,Herodotus mentioned an incestuous dream of the Athenian traitor Hippias thatmotivated his decision to help the Persians attack his home city: “In the pastnight he had seen a vision in his sleep, in which he thought that he lay withhis own mother. He interpreted this dream to signify that he should return toAthens to recover his power, and so die as an old man in his own mothercountry.” Hippias’s dream of violating a sexual taboo foreshadowed his wakingviolation of a political taboo. Like Jocasta, he missed the deeper truth in thisdream and suffered accordingly—the Athenians routed the Persians in the Battleof Marathon (490 BCE). Elsewhere in the Histories Herodotus spoke of thepolitical-military leaders Xerxes of Persia and Astyages of Media seeingtroubling, ominous dreams with elusive messages that defied the kings’ wishfulinterpretations. These reports are consistent with the kinds of royal dreams wehave encountered frequently in Greek and Mesopotamian cultures, strengtheningour overall sense of the popular matrix of dream belief, practice, andexperience that predominated in this era.ASCLEPIUS, GOD OF HEALINGAmong the ancient Greek medical specialists, Hippocrates (460–377 BCE) was themost revered. His naturalistic investigations into the workings of the bodymarked a huge advance in the understanding of the biological systems andphysiological processes upon which human life depends. Many centuries later, theRoman physician Galen (129–200 CE) applied Hippocrates’ insights in surgicalpractice and experimental dissections, in the course of which he established thebasic anatomical principles that have guided Western medicine right up to thepresent day.That much of medical history is fairly well known. Less familiar is thatHippocrates, Galen, and many other Greek and Roman physicians were originallytrained as priest-healers at the temples of Asclepius, where they developed astrong and lasting interest in dreams as tools of healing. Hippocrates served atthe god’s sanctuary in his hometown of Cos, where he later founded his ownschool of medical education. The Hippocratic text On Regimen offered a kind ofdoctor’s manual of dream interpretation, explaining the bodily symbolism ofcommon dream images and seeking diagnostic signs of future illnesses.25[notes.html#ch05fn25] For his part, Galen was trained as a therapeutes at theAsclepian temple of Pergamum (modern-day Turkey). His voluminous medicalwritings frequently mentioned “our ancestral god Asclepius” and the medicallypredictive value of dreams.26 [notes.html#ch05fn26] Thus the two most esteemedphysicians of antiquity were fully trained initiates of Asclepius, the samedeity to whom Socrates dedicated a sacrificial cock with his final breath.Who was this god who inspired the greatest healers of classical Greece andRome?27 [notes.html#ch05fn27] Asclepius was born of Apollo, the mighty oraculargod of Delphi, and a mortal woman named Coronis. When the pregnant Coronis fellin love with a human man, Apollo in his wrath ordered her immediate death. AsCoronis’s lifeless body lay on the funeral pyre, Apollo rescued their baby fromthe flames by performing what amounted to the first caesarean delivery. Thechild was raised by the centaur Chiron, who taught him the arts of medicine.Soon Asclepius became famous as an amazingly gifted physician whose skill was sogreat he could bring the dead back to life. Unfortunately Zeus viewed this as arebellion against the divinely mandated balance between life and death, and hepunished Asclepius by striking him dead with a bolt of lightning. Still, evenZeus had to acknowledge that humans had loved Asclepius, and so he placed thehealing god in the sky as the constellation Ophiocus (which depicts a manholding a snake, the god’s sacred animal), where people could see Asclepiusevery night if they looked up to the heavens.In practical terms, those who worshiped Asclepius sought his specific guidancein treating the whole spectrum of injuries, illnesses, and psychosomaticmaladies that humans suffer in the natural course of life. The central means ofeliciting this guidance was, as mentioned, the practice of temple-based dreamincubation. Our knowledge of the Asclepian temples comes from several sourcescovering many centuries, and a number of temples remain intact today, so we havea good idea of the kinds of ritual activities that occurred during the god’slong reign in the Greek and Roman imagination. Most of the temples were set inaesthetically beautiful and somewhat remote locations, with a large statue ofthe god prominently placed to greet the pilgrims who had journeyed there insearch of relief from their pains. Nonpoisonous snakes roamed the groundsfreely, and people spent their days bathing, praying, and generally cleansingthemselves of their ordinary cares and concerns. The temple walls were inscribedwith stories of the miraculous cures performed by the god, something thatcertainly heightened a sense of expectation among new visitors. At night thetemple priests guided the supplicants into the abaton, the inner sanctum of thetemple, to lie down upon a kline (“clinic,” a ritual bed). While serpentsslithered on the floor around them, the people went to sleep in hopes of acurative dream visitation from Asclepius. When people awoke in the morning theyreported their dreams to the temple priests, who promptly explained theirdiagnostic significance for the illness at hand. The incubation process wouldcontinue for as many nights as it took for the person’s suffering to disappear.Most of the therapeutic techniques used at the Asclepian temples were consistentwith Hippocrates’ basic regimen of healthy diet, walking, cleanliness, and freshair. We can never be sure whether these techniques were actually as effective orlasting as their advocates proclaimed. Considering the Asclepian temples interms of contemporary medical science, they can be seen as centers forgenerating a dream-mediated placebo effect.28 [notes.html#ch05fn28] The fertilecombination of intense personal desire, ritually consecrated space, and repeatedexternal encouragement created a perfect environment for an unusually vivid andmemorable dream that would plausibly have the effect of stimulating whateverautonomous healing systems are at work in the human body. The temple priests maynot have fully understood the physiology of those self-healing systems (nor, tobe honest, do doctors today), but they were experts in practical methods ofactivating them and putting them to therapeutic use. The cultivation ofrevelatory dreams was firmly believed to be an integral part of this process.DREAMING AND EMPIREWhile Athens was busy persecuting its brightest mind, a city-state to the westwas beginning its transformation from a regional center of trade and commerce toa vast empire ruling millions of people. Rome was a fortified settlement as farback as the eighth century BCE, in a region of the Italian peninsula highlyfavorable for agriculture but subject to constant warfare among competingcity-states. Defeated and sacked by the Gauls in 387, Rome quickly rebuiltitself and counterattacked its enemies, winning one victory after another untilit found itself ruling all of Italy and the overseas kingdom of Carthage. Fromthere the familiar cycle of social-structural development took over. The moreslaves and arable land Rome controlled, the more food it could reap fromsystematic agriculture, and those larger crop yields produced the necessaryresources for ever larger professional armies, which enabled the furtheracquisition of land and slaves, and so on. One consequence of Rome’s explosivegrowth was a dramatic increase in opportunities for travel and communicationbetween different regions of the empire. People were allowed (or violentlycompelled, depending on one’s point of view) to develop novel syntheses ofbeliefs and practices drawn from more than one cultural tradition. This wascertainly true in the realm of dreaming, with creative new integrations ofMediterranean and Mesopotamian dream teachings appearing in literature (Virgil,Ovid, Apuleius, Lucian, Plutarch), ritual (Asclepian Temples, magical dreamspells), medicine (Galen and his followers), history (Pausanias), and philosophy(Cicero, Lucretius, Macrobius).29 [notes.html#ch05fn29]The speed of Rome’s military and political ascent far outpaced its nativecultural development, and its founding myth had to be commissioned by theemperor Octavian late in the first century BCE. The task was given to his loyalfollower, the renowned poet Virgil (70–19 BCE). Over the final ten years of hislife Virgil wrote The Aeneid, an epic poem that both glorified the empire andconfessed its crimes and inhumanities. The story followed the relentlesslydutiful hero Aeneas as he journeyed from the flaming walls of Troy to thedistant shores of Italy, where he established Rome as his new home. Borrowingfreely from The Iliad and The Odyssey, Virgil included numerous dream episodesin The Aeneid, more than in both of Homer’s epics combined (which, I imagine,was exactly the point). Most frequently reported were ancestral visitationdreams. Aeneas and several other characters experienced vivid warning dreams inwhich deceased family members alerted them to dangers in waking life. The dreamfigures were described as ghostly wisps, pale in form but wise and trustworthyin spirit. Aeneas also received several dreams of divine reassurance from hisfather and other deities that roused his courage during a crisis or before abattle, motivating him with magnificent visions of Rome’s future destiny. Virgilfurthermore described Latinus, the father of Aeneas’s eventual wife, aspracticing a time-honored form of Greek dream incubation by sleeping on ananimal skin and seeking an answer during sleep from the local deity Faunus.Latinus received a divine dream ordering him to save his daughter for marriageto the stranger who would soon arrive on the shores of Italy.In contrast to these generally positive and helpful divine revelations, Virgilalso spoke of the terrible nightmares suffered by Queen Dido of Carthage, whohad fallen in love with Aeneas and whose dreams accurately foresaw that he wouldultimately abandon her. Dido’s dreams had nothing divine about them; they werebrutal, painfully honest self-portraits, and when they came true she killedherself. The association between dreaming, death, and women also arose in afalse divine dream reported by the mischievous goddess Iris, who disguisedherself as a human in order to stir panic among the Trojan women. She told themshe saw a dream in which the prophetess Cassandra appeared with burning piecesof wood, and screamed, “Look here for Troy. Here is your home!” This was anobviously fabricated dream, a ruse intended to deceive and mislead thelisteners, much like the evil dream sent by Zeus to Agamemnon in The Iliad. Theirony, of course, is that in this case the false dream came true—its apocalypticimagery eventually proved prophetic.Virgil also included passages that envisioned a cosmic genealogy for dreams,with intriguing references to Hesiod and Homer.30 [notes.html#ch05fn30] DuringAeneas’s visit to the underworld he reached the kingdom of the spectral lordDis, at whose gates he found a horrible phantasmagoria of evils: Disease, OldAge, Fear, Hunger, Poverty, Death, and “Death’s brother, Sleep,” and “all theevil Pleasures of the Mind,” and the Furies, and War, and Strife. And in themidst of this darkest and most forlorn of places, Aeneas came upon the Tree ofDreams:Among them stands a giant shaded elm, a tree with spreading boughs and agedarms; they say that is the home of empty Dreams that cling, below, to everyleaf. And more, so many monstrous shapes of savage beasts are stabled there:Centaurs and double-bodied Scyllas; the hundred-handed Briareus; the brute ofLerna, hissing horribly; Chimaera armed with flames; Gorgons and Harpies; andGeryon, the shade that wears three bodies. And here Aeneas, shaken suddenly byterror, grips his sword; he offers naked steel and opposes those who come. Hadnot his wise companion [his father] warned him they were only thin lives thatglide without a body in the hollow semblance of a form, he would in vain havetorn the shadows with his blade.Like his Greek forebearers, Virgil recognized the primal darkness of dreaming,its natural affinity with evil spirits and monsters, its deceptively realisticand emotionally overwhelming qualities, and its external reality as a mysteriousforce beyond the control of humans. Even the heroic Aeneas with his “nakedsteel” was powerless before it.Virgil appropriated Penelope’s “two gates” speech from The Odyssey, though witha puzzling twist.31 [notes.html#ch05fn31] The verses came at the end of a longdream vision in which Anchises revealed to Aeneas the glorious future destiny ofhis son in Rome, concluding with this:There are two gates of Sleep: the one is said to be of horn, through it an easyexit is given to true Shades; the other is made of polished ivory, perfect,glittering, but through that way the Spirits send false dreams into the worldabove. And here Anchises, when he is done with words, accompanies the Sibyl andhis son together, and he sends them through the gate of ivory.This kind of direct Homeric reference was Virgil’s way of anchoring the story ofRome in the wisest, most authoritative traditions of the Greeks. The Aeneidendorsed the basic duality of dreaming expressed by Penelope in The Odyssey,acknowledging the possibility of both divine revelation and deceptive nonsensein dreams. What is strange is the departure of Anchises through the gate ofivory—the portal for false dreams. Was this a subversive critique of Rome’sinflated perception of its own grandeur, or was it simply a typographical errorthat Virgil did not live long enough to correct? We do not know, and theuncertainty adds an extra dimension of epistemological instability to anyattempt to distinguish sharply between true and false dreams in The Aeneid.ONEIROCRITICABy far the best source of information about dreams in ancient Rome is theOneirocritica (Interpretation of Dreams) by Artemidorus of Daldis, aprofessional diviner from a Roman province in present-day Turkey.32[notes.html#ch05fn32] As we shall see in coming chapters, his text, originallywritten in part as a private training manual for his son, has been copied andtranslated so often that it could be the single most influential dream book inthe world. Artemidorus lived in the second century CE, during a relativelypeaceful and prosperous era of Roman history. Few details of his life are known,beyond that he read a great deal and traveled widely throughout theMediterranean world. He referred to many other dream manuals he had studied,indicating a lively tradition of these kinds of books in Roman culture. He madea point of emphasizing the rationality of his approach and the empirical basisof his interpretations, even when his studies led him into folk practicesscorned by the cultural elite. He said he had “consorted for many years with themuch-despised diviners of the marketplace” in order to deepen his oneiricknowledge:People who assume a holier-than-thou countenance and who arch their eyebrows ina superior way dismiss them as beggars, charlatans, and buffoons, but I haveignored their disparagement. Rather, in the different cities of Greece and atgreat religious gatherings in that country, in Asia, in Italy, and in thelargest and most populous of the islands, I have patiently listened to olddreams and their consequences. For there was no other possible way in which toget practice in these matters.Artemidorus was familiar with the skepticism toward dreams expressed byauthoritative voices of Roman culture (e.g., Cicero, Lucretius). He wrote theOneirocritica as a response to that skepticism, aiming to prove the legitimacyand practical value of dream interpretation in ordinary people’s lives. To thatend he developed a rational classification of typical dreams and their commonmeanings. To begin, he divided dreams into two categories, enhypnion andoneiros: “Oneiros differs from enhypnion in that the first indicates a futurestate of affairs, while the other indicates a present state of affairs.” Asexamples of enhypnion Artemidorus described hungry people dreaming of eating,thirsty people dreaming of drinking, and fearful people dreaming of what theyfear, all of which were accurate reflections of the present concerns of thedreamer. Oneiros, by contrast, went beyond the present to “call to the dreamer’sattention a prediction of future events.” Artemidorus then made a seconddistinction, between theorematic and allegorical dreams. Theorematic dreams weresaid to be direct in their imagery and meaning (a dream of a shipwreckforetelling an actual shipwreck), whereas allegorical dreams involved indirectimagery, symbols, and metaphors; in such cases, “the soul is conveying somethingobscurely by physical means.” Here and elsewhere Artemidorus expressed a broadlyspiritual appreciation for the prophetic powers of the human soul and the divineprovenance of certain dreams, though he made it clear that his focus was oninterpretive practice, not philosophical theory:I do not, like Aristotle, inquire as to whether the cause of our dreaming isoutside of us and comes from the gods or whether it is motivated by somethingwithin, which disposes the soul in a certain way and causes a natural event tohappen to it. Rather, I use the word in the same way that we customarily callall unforeseen things god-sent.The main body of the Oneirocritica consisted of an extensive catalog of dreamimages and their interpretations. Hundreds of examples were discussed, includingdreams of going blind, losing teeth, being beheaded, and many other forms ofbodily misfortune; dreams of rivers, mountains, clouds, trees, kings, priests,gods, mythological beasts, family members, and all manner of sexual partners. Alengthy section considered the traditional Greek and Roman theme of a sondreaming of sex with his mother: “The case of one’s mother is both complex andmanifold and admits of many different interpretations—a thing not all dreaminterpreters have realized. The fact is that the mere act of intercourse byitself is not enough to show what is portended. Rather, the manner of theembraces and the various positions of the bodies indicate different outcomes.”The interpretations Artemidorus offered were related primarily to the dreamer’spersonal life (e.g., health, occupation, finances, family), though he grantedthat political leaders could have dreams with significance for the broadercommunity as well. He emphasized that dream interpretation was not simply amatter of looking up meanings in a dream dictionary, and that a detailedknowledge of the dreamer’s life was required to insure the accuracy of anyinterpretation: “It is profitable—indeed, not only profitable but necessary—forthe dreamer as well as for the person who is interpreting that the dreaminterpreter know the dreamer’s identity, occupation, birth, financial status,state of health, and age.” Artemidorus described several cases of multivalentinterpretation in which the same dream experienced by different people yieldeddifferent meanings, and also paradoxical cases in which good contents portendedbad results (e.g., a man dreamed of receiving two loaves of bread from Heliosthe sun-god, and died two days later) and bad contents foretold good results(e.g., a poor man dreaming of being hit by a thunderbolt meant the gaining ofwealth). Paradoxical interpretations were always possible, but in practiceArtemidorus usually focused on direct similarities between dream content andwaking life, guided by what I would call a principle of psychosocialharmony—whatever appeared in accordance with social customs was good, whateverdeviated from those customs was bad.Although the Oneirocritica was intended to benefit his readers, Artemidorusinsisted that books were not enough: “I maintain that it is necessary for theinterpreter of dreams to have prepared himself from his own resources and to usehis native intelligence rather than simply to rely upon manuals.” Throughout thebook he emphasized that personal experience was the only reliable guide.I have always called upon experience as the witness and guiding principle of mystatements. Everything has been the result of personal experience, since I havenot done anything else, and have always devoted myself, day and night, to thestudy of dream interpretation.Soon after Artemidorus’s time, the Roman Empire collapsed. The city was finallyoverrun by Visigoth and Vandal armies in the fifth century CE, and fromthenceforth Graeco-Roman civilization no longer reigned supreme over the Westernworld. The Mediterranean culture of dreaming continued, however, and we canstill see living traces of it today, intermixed with local versions ofChristianity.33 [notes.html#ch05fn33] The mountain villagers of the Greek islandof Naxos, for example, continue to practice dream incubation in hopes of divinehealing and guidance. Greek Orthodox Christians in Thebes and members of thereligious community known as Anastenaria in Bulgaria pay close attention totheir dreams, sleeping in churches and the shrines of saints to elicit heavenlyrevelations and favorable prophecies. Long before Christianity came on thescene, an ancient and complex network of Greek, Roman, and Mesopotamian dreamtraditions had profoundly shaped the sleeping and waking imaginations of thepeople of this part of the world. The Christian dream teachings to be discussedin the next chapter are, in historical terms, a response to (and continuationof) those deeply rooted traditions.SUMMARYJudging by their myths and epic poems, the ancient Greeks and Romans believeddreams were externally caused encounters with the gods. But a closer look atthese mythic tales reveals a more sophisticated psychological understanding ofthe dreaming imagination. Once we take into account the writings of thephilosophers, poets, and historians of Greece and Rome, we have to acknowledge astrong kinship between their dream theories and the theories of modern Westernscientists. For the Greeks and Romans, a few dreams were accepted as genuineconduits of divine energy and religious experience, but most dream experienceshad their origins in the natural processes of the sleeping mind. Many of thegreatest philosophers dismissed dreaming as inferior to waking rationality, andthey took little interest in exploring any of its possible functions orpurposes. Nevertheless, dreams remained very popular over the centuries as auniversally accessible source of divine guidance and prophetic knowledge. Moreimportant than prophecy, however, was the power of healing in dreams. The dreamincubation rituals of Asclepius and the medical practices of Hippocrates andGalen all cultivated the healing resources of dreaming to an unprecedenteddegree of effectiveness. The interpretation of dreams in Greek and Romancultures was believed to be a perilous affair, with dangerous consequences forthose who misread the will of the gods. Hence the prominence of dream books andprofessional interpreters who were skilled in the process of translating dreamimages into waking meanings. Building on the wisdom of the Egyptians, Assyrians,and other Fertile Crescent cultures, the dream interpreters of Greece and Rome(best exemplified by Artemidorus) developed a systematic approach that relied onthe interpreter’s “native intelligence,” common sense, and personal experienceof the world. Such a simple and straightforward approach enabled anyone topractice dream interpretation, not just professional experts—planting ademocratic seed in a realm of experience that would increasingly becomeconstrained by religious authority."},{"pageContent":"6CHRISTIANITYHere, midway in the book, we should consider the strong cross-currentsdeveloping in our knowledge of the dreaming-religion connection. Along withabundant evidence of the positive value of dreaming in religious history we havealso found many voices of caution, mistrust, and doubt regarding the divinemeaningfulness of dreams. If nothing else, recognition of these differentperspectives should put to rest any attempt to characterize the minds of ancientpeoples as somehow irrational, deficient, or primitive in comparison with thescientific mind of today. Debates about the truth vs. nonsense of dreaming arenothing new. They extend as far back in time as recorded history allows us tosee. From the Upanishads and the Chinese philosopher Wang Chong to Jeremiah,Penelope, and Aristotle, a degree of rational skepticism has been a recurrentfeature of human interaction with dreaming, generating several explanations thatdisregard heavenly causes and focus instead on the physical, emotional, andenvironmental conditions of the dreamer. Ancient peoples did not possess theresearch technologies to study these factors the way modern scientists do, butthey were just as aware of the naturalistic influences on dream formation andfunction.The story becomes even more complicated when we take into account otherhistorical teachings (e.g., from Buddha and Plato) that treat the bodily basisof dreaming as the beginning, not the end, of critical analysis. From theseperspectives, physically arousing dreams were seen as evidence of mental orspiritual weakness, a failure to control the emotions, desires, and impulsesthat impeded the highest forms of human development. This was especially trueregarding sexual dreams, the occurrence of which has been reported in everyculture considered so far. The universal prevalence of sexually stimulatingdreams has been solidly confirmed by modern sleep laboratory research, with thediscovery that each phase of REM sleep is automatically accompanied by anincrease in blood flow to the genitals, producing erections in men and clitoralswelling in women, occasionally leading all the way to physical climax.1[notes.html#ch06fn1] It is obviously difficult to study such phenomena with muchprecision, but apparently these nocturnal climaxes initially occur before peoplehave had any waking-life sexual activity, and they recur later in liferegardless of the individual’s waking sexual behavior. All this poses a seriousproblem for religious and spiritual traditions that emphasize celibacy,asceticism, and strict control of sexual desires. If your tradition begins witha strong emphasis on the dangers of sexuality and bodily instincts generally,then dreaming automatically becomes a threat to religious purity, and sleepbecomes a lifelong battleground between good and evil. This has been anespecially difficult challenge for Christianity, as its historical appreciationfor the divine power of revelatory visions has competed with a fearful hostilitytoward the sensual temptations of oneiric experience.NOVUM TESTAMENTUMChristianity originated in the ministry of a Jewish prophet and healer namedJesus, who was born sometime in the last years of the first century BCE in theeastern Mediterranean town of Bethlehem, in an area (present-day Israel) underthe control of the Roman Empire. His birth was a miraculous event in many ways,and dreams were said to have played a significant role. The Gospel of Matthewopened with Joseph (named after the greatest dreamer of the Torah) receiving aseries of four heaven-sent dreams that guided him in the care and protection ofJesus, his newborn foster-son.2 [notes.html#ch06fn2] When Joseph first learnedof Mary’s pregnancy, which occurred “before they came together,” he decided heshould quietly divorce her:But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in adream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary your wife, forthat which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit; she will bear a son, andyou shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” …When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; hetook his wife, but knew her not until she had borne a son; and he called hisname Jesus.Here, at the very beginning of Jesus’s life, a dream was credited with having aremarkably powerful and beneficial impact—protecting his family, establishinghis divine identity, prophesizing his future mission, and revealing the name heshould be called. This marks another striking instance of religious dreaming ata time of birth, a moment of newly emergent power. The heavenly provenance ofJoseph’s dream was never questioned; he awakened and immediately obeyed.Likewise, he immediately obeyed the warning he received in another dreamregarding the murderous intentions of the Roman governor Herod. Following thebirth of Jesus and the departure of the “wise men from the East” (who werethemselves warned in a dream to avoid Herod), “an angel of the Lord appeared toJoseph in a dream and said, ‘Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee toEgypt, and remain there till I tell you; for Herod is about to search for thechild, to destroy him.’ And he rose and took the child and his mother by night.”In this dream the heavenly message was so urgent and the predicted threat sodire that Joseph could not wait until morning to act. He rose in the night andfled with his family to Egypt, waiting there for further heavenly guidance,which came some years later: “An angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Josephin Egypt, saying, ‘Rise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land ofIsrael, for those who sought the child’s life are dead.’ ” Once back in Israel,Joseph realized he still had to reason to fear persecution from Herod’s son,“and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee,”specifically the town of Nazareth. Thus, by means of a series of clear, direct,and unquestionably trustworthy dreams, Jesus was brought to the safety of hisnew home, where he would live for the next thirty years in apparent anonymity asan Aramaic-speaking Jewish carpenter.The rise of Jesus’s career as a teacher, healer, exorcist, and prophet wasstimulated by several powerful religious experiences, some visual and othersauditory, in which he was said to have felt an overwhelming presence of God’sspirit. Not all these experiences were pleasant; at one point, “the spiritimmediately drove him out into the wilderness. And he was in the wilderness forforty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts.”3[notes.html#ch06fn3] Nor were his visions exclusively private, as when he tooksome of his followers away to a high mountain, where “he was transfigured beforethem, and his garments became glistening, intensely white, as no fuller on earthcould bleach them. And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses; and they weretalking with Jesus.”4 [notes.html#ch06fn4] It is significant that none of thesemystically charged experiences were described as dreams. The religious status ofJesus was so lofty that his spiritual capacities had evidently developed beyondthe need for dreaming. Like his visionary companion, Moses, Jesus spoke to Godface to face, directly and without the interfering medium of dark speech. Theabsence of dream reports in Jesus’s life may also have been because of theeditorial interests of the Gospel writers, who were actively trying tostrengthen and defend their small countercultural movement. As we have seen inthe last two chapters, the pagan civilization surrounding the early Christianswas permeated with fantastic stories of gods and goddesses helping humans intheir dreams, and thus it would be an effective way of highlighting the divinesuperiority of Jesus to portray him as beyond dreaming.5 [notes.html#ch06fn5]Why would God need to send a dream to Himself?One other dream was mentioned during Jesus’s life in the Gospel of Matthew, andit came to an unexpected figure at a critical moment in the narrative.6[notes.html#ch06fn6] Jesus had been captured and brought before Pilate, theRoman governor of Jerusalem, who was contemplating the fate of theself-proclaimed Messiah. Just then, Pilate received a message from his wife:“Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much over himtoday in a dream.” Pilate already suspected that the charges brought by thePharisaic Jews against Jesus were false, and he was considering whether topardon the prisoner. But his wife’s dream turned him away from making any activedecision. In her message she acknowledged the spiritual worthiness of Jesus, butthe distressing quality of her dream drove her to plead for Pilate’s totalwithdrawal from the situation. Not knowing the content of her nightmare (if itactually happened), we cannot say whether her interpretation or Pilate’s finaldecision—washing his hands before the crowd and delivering Jesus to becrucified—were justified responses to the dream. The ambiguous meaning of thisdream, along with its obscure source (nothing else is said of Pilate’s wife) andtragic contribution to Jesus’s death, suggest a doubtful Christian attitudetoward dreaming generally, effectively saying that the new religion did not relyon the misleading divination practices of the pagans. An alternative possibilityis that the story reflected a deeper Christian recognition of emotionallyintense, highly memorable dreams as capable of shaping the behavior of pagansand Christians alike (many early converts were Roman women), all according tothe ultimate salvation plan of God.In the rest of the Novum Testamentum (the canonical text of Christianity,written in the first and second centuries CE and canonized in the fourth centuryCE) four other dreams were mentioned, all experienced by Paul, the Roman convertand pioneering missionary.7 [notes.html#ch06fn7] Paul reported many types ofreligious experiences and communications with God, and it was clear that he (orthe biblical editors) felt some degree of familiarity and comfort with dreamingas an authentic source of Christian revelation. However much his teachingspushed for a radical break between Christian and pagan worldviews, Paul acceptedthe general belief, so widely shared among Mesopotamian, Greek, and Romanpeople, that dreaming bore a divine potentiality. The four dreams described inthe Book of Acts were all related to Paul’s missionary activities, and they weredescribed in terms that would be easily understood by the people of his time:“The following night the Lord stood by him and said, ‘Take courage, for as youhave testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must bear witness also at Rome.’ ”A deity appears during the night and stands before a sleeping person to delivera message of reassurance in the face of dire waking challenges—this was theprototypical form of a mystical dream, and in Paul’s case it provided alegitimate source of inspiration, encouragement, and guidance for his missionaryactivities: “And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia wasstanding beseeching him and saying, ‘Come over to Macedonia and help us.’ Andwhen he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia,concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.” Nothing wassaid yet about the question of true vs. deceptive dreams; Paul’s spiritualintegrity was apparently sufficient to guarantee that whatever messages hereceived were genuinely sent by God and absolutely trustworthy as guides tofuture action.Other than a quotation from the Book of Joel regarding the marvelous powers ofspirit that will be given to all people in the Messianic age (“your sons andyour daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and yourold men shall dream dreams”), these are the only dream references in the NovumTestamentum.8 [notes.html#ch06fn8] The final text of Christian scripture, theRevelation to John, could perhaps be considered an epic-length visionarynightmare, comparable in its awful allegorical symbolism to the horrifyingdreams of Nebuchadnezzar or the world-destroying nightmares of Buddha’s wifeGopa and the Kuru warrior Karna. If nothing else, the spectacular visual imageryof Revelation and its evocation of primal existential fears of annihilation anddeath combined to create a metaphorical template for later expressions ofChristian apocalypticism in dreams and other modes of visionary expression.CONVERTS AND MARTYRSMoving from canonical texts to the actual lives of the early Christians,dreaming appears to have been a lively arena for the interplay of Christian andpagan religious practices. The subject of dreams provided a kind of commonspiritual language among all Mediterranean peoples, and Christian missionariesfound that speaking to people in that dream language could be a fruitful meansof converting them to the new faith. Good evidence of dreaming as an impetustoward Christian conversion comes in a work of the late first century CE knownas The Shepherd, by the former Roman slave Hermas.9 [notes.html#ch06fn9] TheShepherd presented a personal testimony of spiritual struggle and Christiantriumph in the form of five elaborate dream visions (horaseis, a term related tovision and seeing). In these dreams Hermas spoke at length with an angel whoguided him in a painful but cleansing analysis of his moral weaknesses,transforming his personality and attaining the spiritual purity that only theChristian faith could provide. As always, we do not know if anyone named Hermasactually dreamed these dreams. But as a literary document aimed at persuading anaudience, The Shepherd clearly assumed that first-century Romans wouldunderstand, and could be swayed by, references to powerful dream experiences.Hermas’s cause may have been further strengthened by his honest acknowledgmentof the taboo-violating, morally transgressive tendencies of dreaming, tendenciesthat Christianity promised to overcome. At one point in his story Hermasreported experiencing a kind of vision-within-the-vision:During my prayer I saw the heavens open and that woman of whom I was enamoredsaluting me with the words: “Greetings, Hermas!” With my eyes fixed on her, Isaid, “Lady, what are you doing here?” Her answer was: “I have been taken up toconvict you of your sins before the Lord.” To this I said: “Are you my accuserat this moment?” “No,” she said, “but you must listen to what I am about to tellyou. God who dwells in heaven, the creator of beings out of nothing, he, whoincreases and multiplies them for the sake of his holy church, is angry with youfor your offenses against me.” For answer I said: “Offenses against you! How so?Have I ever made a coarse remark to you? Have I not always regarded you as agoddess? Did I not always show you the respect due to a sister? Lady, why do youmake these false charges of wickedness and uncleanness against me?” With a laughshe said: “In your heart there has arisen the desire of evil.”The figure in the dream vision was a Christian woman named Rhode, whom Hermashad once served during his years as a slave. In describing the dream, Hermasrecalled an incident from the past in which Rhode asked for his help while shewas bathing, an experience that naturally elicited sexual desires in Hermas.Although he never acted on those desires in waking life, they remained adisturbing presence in his inner world, and the dream-Rhode had come to forceHermas to face the reality of those hidden personal desires. The Christian faithrequired not just a change of behavior but a change of heart, and in the comingcenturies many Christians would turn to their dreams for self-analyticalinsights into that deeper process of psychospiritual transformation.The most dramatic narratives of early Christianity involved the deaths ofmartyrs who were persecuted and gruesomely killed because of their faith. One ofthe earliest and most influential of these martyr texts consisted of the diaryof a young woman named Vibia Perpetua, who was mauled to death by wild lions ina Carthage amphitheater in 203 CE.10 [notes.html#ch06fn10] Perpetua was aneducated member of a well-to-do family, but her conversion to Christianity puther into conflict with the Roman imperial government and its requirement thateveryone participate in rituals of fidelity to the emperor and the gods.Perpetua refused, and so she was imprisoned and sentenced to public execution.During the weeks leading up to her death, Perpetua recorded a diary in which shedescribed arguing with her distraught father, worrying about her infant child(she was secretly breast-feeding him in prison), and dreaming. Her first dreamcame in response to an incubation prompted by her brother, who said to her, “Mylady, my sister, you are now greatly blessed; so much so that you can ask for avision, and you will be shown if it is to be suffering unto death or a passingthing.” Perpetua did as he suggested, and was shown a remarkable dream thatblended Christian imagery with surrealistic details from her own personalcondition:I saw a bronze ladder, marvelously long, reaching as far as heaven, and narrowtoo: people could climb it only one at a time. And on the sides of the ladderevery kind of iron implement was fixed: there were swords, lances, hooks,cutlasses, javelins, so that if anyone went up carelessly or not lookingupwards, she would be torn and her flesh caught on the sharp iron. And beneaththe ladder lurked a serpent of wondrous size, who laid ambushes for thosemounting, making them terrified of the ascent.With the encouragement of a fellow Christian, Perpetua stepped on the head ofthe serpent and rose up the ladder, praying for safety “in Christ’s name.” Onceshe reached the top of the ladder, she found herself in a spiritual utopia ofpastoral bliss:I saw an immense space of garden, and in the middle of it a white-haired mansitting in shepherd’s garb, vast milking sheep, with many thousands of peopledressed in shining white standing all around. And he raised his head, looked atme, and said, “You are welcome, child.” And he called me, and gave me, itseemed, a mouthful of the caseo he was milking; and I accepted it in both myhands together, and ate it, and all those standing around said: “Amen.” And atthe sound of that word I awoke, still chewing something indefinable and sweet.And at once I told my brother, and we understood that it would be mortalsuffering; and we began to have no more hope in the world.In response to her incubation prayers, Perpetua received a prophetic vision thatconfirmed her grim bodily fate while reassuring her about the fate of hereternal soul. The dream directly incorporated a great deal of imagery fromclassic Christian belief and iconography—the malevolent serpent, the ladder toheaven, the benevolent shepherd, the shining white garments. But the climacticmoment of the dream came in the experience of eating the caseo, variouslytranslated as cheese, milk, or sweet curds. This was the moment when Perpetuaawoke, with that vividly pleasant taste sensation carrying over into wakingawareness. The personal impact of this experience must have been tremendous,given that Perpetua was a nursing mother who was abandoning her child inobedience to a higher religious cause. In waking life she was worried aboutfailing to provide her child with biological nourishment, but in her dream shewas blessed to receive the ultimate in spiritual nourishment. A few days later aminor miracle occurred: “And somehow, through God’s will, it [the child] nolonger needed the breast, nor did my breasts become inflamed—so I was nottormented with worry for the child, or with soreness.” Perpetua’s Christiantransformation was complete.Her next two dreams reflected her shift of existential interest and orientationfrom this world to the next. While praying one day in prison, the name of along-deceased brother, “Dinocrates,” suddenly popped out of her mouth. AskingGod for another vision, Perpetua received “that very night” a dream ofDinocrates, with cancer marring his face as it did right before he died,pathetically trying to reach his thirsty lips to a pool of water. When Perpetuaawoke she resolved to pray for her brother’s soul, feeling confident she had theability to aid his struggles. A few days later she dreamed of Dinocrates healthyand clean, happily drinking from a golden bowl of water that never ran dry.Thus, as her own death approached, Perpetua concentrated her energies not on herown plight but on helping a deceased loved one in his spiritual journey beyondthis life. Her final dream came the day before her execution, and it portrayedan epic battle between herself (transformed into a male wrestler) and “anEgyptian, foul of aspect.” The wrestler-Perpetua fought ferociously with her/hisfists and feet, rising off the ground at one point to land several flying kicksagainst the Egyptian’s head. Finally, she/he was declared the winner, “andtriumphantly I began to walk towards the Gate of the Living. And I awoke. And Iknew I should have to fight not against wild beasts but against the Fiend; but Iknew the victory would be mine.”Her diary ended there. The next day she walked out into the amphitheater and wasmauled to death by lions in front of a cheering crowd. A worse fate could hardlybe imagined, at least in worldly terms. But in her dream visions Perpetuadiscovered a deeper reality within herself, the reality of her Christian soul.No longer identifying herself as a daughter or mother, no longer attached to hergender or her physical body, willfully violating the biological instinct forself-preservation, Perpetua gloried in the spiritual power and freedom that camefrom surrendering herself entirely to God.Not all Christians were persecuted so viciously, but Perpetua was hardly alonein suffering the wrath of Roman officials who saw the new religion’s loftymonotheism as a challenge to their authority and a threat to the empire’s socialorder. Despite (and partly because of) this governmental hostility, Christianitygrew rapidly, aided by stories about converts like Hermas and martyrs likePerpetua, and also by the energetic caregiving practices of local churchmembers. Inspired by Jesus’s healing miracles, the early Christians concentratedtheir missionary work on providing aid, comfort, and medical attention to anyonewho was sick and suffering. When the people regained their health, theyfrequently became devoted members of the Christian faithful who could offerpersonal testimonies of healing power. In just the one hundred or so yearsbetween Perpetua’s death and the rise of Constantine the Great, Christianity wastransformed from an oppressed minority sect to the dominant faith of the empire.According to legend, a dream marked a particularly decisive moment in theprocess of Constantine’s conversion.11 [notes.html#ch06fn11] Before his crowningvictory against Maxentius at the Milvian Bridge in 312 CE, Constantine saw adaytime vision followed by a nocturnal dream in which he beheld a brilliantimage of the labarum, the sign of the Cross and emblem of the Christian God. Thenext day he ordered his troops to inscribe this image on their shields, and whenthey won the battle (despite being outnumbered five to one) Constantine gavecredit to the God of the Christians. His battlefield conversion decisivelyshifted Roman sentiment in favor of the new faith, with momentous consequencesfor its future development. Although persecutions continued in various places,Constantine’s “Edict of Milan” in 313 gave Christianity official status as alegal religion, and his personal testimony persuaded many people in the rulingclasses to forego their pagan allegiances and submit to the Christian God. ThusChristianity took the fateful step of assuming the powers, and burdens, ofruling an empire.FATHERS OF THE CHURCHDuring the long period of Roman hostility to their faith, many of the earlyChristians took up residence in the unpopulated wilds and hinterlands of theempire, seeking a life of spiritual simplicity and purity away from the worldlytemptations of pagan cities. Even after Constantine’s conversion and thesubsequent elimination of official repression, many Christians still felt drawnto seek God’s presence in the desert, inspired in large part by Jesus’stransformational sojourn through the wilderness. And, like Jesus, the so-calleddesert fathers were besieged in their solitary contemplations by demons.Dreaming took on a decidedly negative character in this context, and strenuousefforts were made to disregard the seductive images and alluring sensations thatcame during sleep. Evagrius Ponticus (346–399 CE), one of the most literate ofthe desert fathers, developed an elaborate categorization of the manytemptations facing the solitary Christian, and he said that each type oftemptation had its corresponding type of nightmare.12 [notes.html#ch06fn12] Hissystem left no place for spiritually positive dreams, and he advocated instead adetachment from all dreaming experience:Natural processes which occur in sleep without accompanying images of astimulating nature are, to a certain measure, indications of a healthy soul. Butimages that are distinctly formed are a clear indication of sickness. You may becertain that the faces one sees in dreams are, when they occur as ill-definedimages, symbols of former affective experiences. Those which are seen clearly,on the other hand, indicate wounds that are still fresh. … The proof of apatheia[peacefulness of soul] is had when the spirit begins to see its own light, whenit remains in a state of tranquility in the presence of the images it has duringsleep and when it maintains its calm as it beholds the affairs of life.Using naturalistic terms virtually identical to what we have heard fromUpanishadic Hindus, Buddhists, Platonists, and others, Evagrius took a firmstance against the dreaming imagination. Nothing good could come from dreams, heasserted, and the only recourse for a true Christian was to strive continuouslyto break free from such emotionally entangling fantasies in favor of a purity offaith that remained steadfast and divinely illuminated whether awake or asleep.This was the ethos that shaped many of the original Christian monasteries, andanti-dream admonitions became part of the introductory training of novitiates.Antiochus Monachus, a seventh-century-CE official at a monastery near Jerusalem,gave a homily in which he condemned virtually all dream experiences, saying they“are nothing other than things of the imagination and hallucinations of a mindled astray. They are the illusions of evil demons to deceive us and result fromtheir enticements with the attendant purpose of carrying off a man topleasure.”13 [notes.html#ch06fn13] To illustrate his argument, Antiochus toldthe story of a kind of Jewish counter-conversion mediated by dreaming:There was a certain monk, a model solitary, on Mount Sinai who exhibitedextraordinary ascetic discipline and for many years remained shut up in hiscell. Later he was deceived by diabolical visions and dreams, and he succumbedto Judaism and the circumcision of the flesh. Moreover, the Devil showed himtruthful dreams many times, and through them he [the Devil] won over hisconfused state of mind. Later he showed him the host of martyrs, and theapostles, and all the Christians in the dark and filled completely with shame.As against this, he illuminated with a bright light Moses, the prophets, and thehateful-to-God Jewish people, and [showed them] living joyously and full ofcheer. Perceiving these things, the wretched man straightaway rose up and leftthe Holy Mountain.Such a bitter tale was clearly intended to foster a skeptical attitude towardall dreams, even those that were vivid, recurrent, and truthful. From hisperspective as a monastic authority and defender of the faith, Antiochus sawdreaming as a threat to the Christian’s purity of mind and a dangeroustemptation to stray from the one true God. The unfortunate irony was that thevery monastic practices he was teaching (e.g., praying and sleeping alone on asacred mountain) were creating the classic conditions for dream incubation,almost guaranteeing the occurrence of powerful night visions. We can only wonderhow many of his monks experienced such spiritually charged dreams, and neversaid anything about them.Two of the most influential early Christian theologians, Jerome (347–419 CE) andAugustine (354–430 CE), gave an even stronger stamp to this emerging churchdoctrine about the dangers of dreaming, although both of them paradoxicallyacknowledged the importance of dreams in their own spiritual autobiographies.Jerome was born in a Christian family but educated in Roman and Greek culture,and as a young man he struggled to reconcile his Christian faith with his loveof classical philosophy.14 [notes.html#ch06fn14] One night, while he wasextremely sick, Jerome had a dream in which he was suddenly “caught up in thespirit” and taken before “the judgment seat of the Judge.” The light was sobrilliant that he immediately threw himself to the ground. The Judge askedJerome who he was, and he answered, “I am a Christian.” But the Judge replied,‘You lie, you are a follower of Cicero and not of Christ.” Jerome was thenlashed and scourged until he finally swore never again to read the books ofpagan authors. With this oath, he was dismissed by the heavenly tribunal. Then,I returned to the upper world, and, to the surprise of all, I opened upon themeyes so drenched with tears that my distress served to convince even thecredulous. And that this was no sleep nor idle dream, such as those by which weare often mocked, I call to witness the tribunal before which I lay, and theterrible judgment which I feared. … I profess that my shoulders were black andblue, that I felt the bruises long after I awoke from my sleep, and thatthenceforth I read the books of God with a zeal greater than I had previouslygiven to the books of men.As in the literary dream visions of Hermas, Jerome was subjected to an arduoustest of conscience and spiritual integrity. Previously he considered himself aChristian, but this experience revealed the superficiality of his faith. Thestrong carryover effects (tears, distress, fear) contributed to the dream’sreinvigorating impact on his religious practices, purifying his life ofnon-Christian influences and intensifying his spiritual ardor. The physicalmarks on his body sound like post-hoc embellishments, though Jerome anticipatedsuch doubts and insisted on the honesty of his account. In any case, the simplefact that Jerome discussed his dream at all indicated he took dreaming seriouslyas an authentic source of Christian revelation, indeed as a very useful sourceat that particular historical moment. Jerome’s personal conflict between paganand Christian cultures was emblematic of a wider clash in the broaderMediterranean world, a clash that accelerated with the crumbling of Romanauthority in the late fourth and early fifth centuries CE. His extraordinarydream enabled him to overcome that conflict by breaking his ties with theclassical past and surrendering himself entirely to the Christian future.Whatever its impact on his personal spirituality, the dream did not persuadeJerome to advocate greater popular involvement with dreaming, as he directlywarned Christians against the dream incubation practices of pagans who “sit inthe graves and the temples of idols where they are accustomed to stretch out onthe skins of sacrificial animals in order to know the future by dreams,abominations which are still practiced today in the temples of Asclepius.”Furthermore, Jerome’s monumental Vulgate translation of the Bible from Hebrewand Greek into Latin included two apparently deliberate mistranslations ofLeviticus 19:26 and Deuteronomy 18:10, which he rendered thus: “You shall notpractice augury nor observe dreams.” In this small but decisive way (the Hebrewtexts do not specifically mention dreams as a prohibited category), Jeromelumped dream interpretation together with all other forbidden types of pagandivination. For the next thousand years, the Christian Church would find it easyto use this text as an authoritative biblical teaching against the religiousvalue of dreaming.Jerome’s more famous contemporary, Augustine, also struggled with a profoundsplit between his Roman education and his desire to become a true Christian, anddreams were an ambivalent factor in his conflict.15 [notes.html#ch06fn15] Theappeal of Christianity was personified for Augustine by his mother, Monica, aparagon of spiritual purity who finally persuaded him to convert at the age ofthirty-two, after many years of immoral behavior, psychosomatic illness, andpagan philosophizing. Reflecting on his conversion in the Confessions, Augustinesaid his mother knew he would eventually join her in the Christian faith becauseof a God-sent dream in which a smiling young man showed her that her son wasstanding on the same wooden rule as she was: “By this dream the joy of thisdevout woman, to be fulfilled much later, was predicted many years in advance togive consolation at this time in her anxiety.” Monica had an uncanny ability todiscern true from false dreams: “She used to say that, by a certain smellindescribable in words, she could tell the difference between your [God’s]revelation and her own soul dreaming.” Augustine’s reverence for his mothercompelled him to acknowledge her skills as a divine dreamer. But at the sametime he emphasized the spiritual dangers of sleep and dreaming, particularly foraspiring Christian ascetics who were trying to renounce their sinful pasts andlive a life of pure chastity. Speaking of his own nightmares, he said:In my memory … there still live images of acts which were fixed there by mysexual habit. These images attack me. While I am awake they have no force, butin sleep they not only arouse pleasure but even elicit consent, and are verylike the actual act. The illusory image within the soul has such force upon myflesh that false dreams have an effect on me when asleep, which the realitycould not have when I am awake. During this time of sleep surely it is not mytrue self, Lord my God? Yet how great a difference between myself at the timewhen I am asleep and myself when I return to the waking state.Even though he had not been sexually active for years, Augustine stillexperienced sexually stimulating dreams, and this raised a tough theologicalquestion. In what way does the dreaming self relate to the Christian soul?Augustine’s answer was to distinguish sharply between the two. He absolvedhimself of any responsibility for his dreams (“we did not actively do what, toour regret, has somehow been done in us”), and he begged God to help him“extinguish the lascivious impulses of my sleep.”Later in his career, when people from his Christian community in North Africaasked him questions about dreams, Augustine cautiously acknowledged theoccurrence and possible spiritual value of visitation dreams, and he once wrotein a letter about a remarkable dream that God sent to a doctor friend namedGennadius.16 [notes.html#ch06fn16] In the dream a young man confronted Gennadiusand asked how he was seeing. Confused, Gennadius did not know what to say, andthe young man went on:As while you are asleep and lying on your bed these eyes of your body are nowunemployed and doing nothing, and yet you have eyes with which you behold me,and enjoy this vision, so, after your death, while your bodily eyes shall bewholly inactive, there shall be in you a life by which you shall still live, anda faculty of perception by which you shall still perceive. Beware, therefore,after this of harboring doubts as to whether the life of man shall continueafter death.A self-transcending lucid dream like this was, according to Augustine, alegitimate piece of evidence supporting Christian teachings, and we can readilyunderstand why. The intensity of visual perception and the high-ordermetacognitive functioning dramatically distinguished Gennadius’s experience fromordinary dreaming, enhancing its impact on his waking consciousness. The idea ofan autonomous soul that could survive without the body would naturally arise asa result, providing experiential confirmation of the religious doctrine.Ultimately, however, the main thrust of Augustine’s teachings deemphasizeddreams. They were difficult to interpret properly and arose from a type ofimaginative vision that was limited by the finitude of human mentalrepresentations. Augustine placed dreaming below the highest form of religiousexperience, namely, the intellectual vision of pure mystical ecstasy.In the later development of Christian history it would be the doubtful voices ofAugustine, Jerome, and the desert fathers who most influenced the Church’sattitude toward dreaming. Other voices advocating a more appreciative andexpansive approach never received as much consideration, perhaps because theyechoed too closely the pagan beliefs and practices that Christian authoritieswere busily trying to stamp out. The theologian Tertullian (155–230 CE?) ofCarthage wrote at length about dreams, dividing them into the three categoriesof a deo, a daemonio, ab anima (from God, from the devil, from the soul) andhighlighting the universality of dream revelations—“Now, who is such a strangerto human experience as not sometimes to have perceived some truth in dreams?”17[notes.html#ch06fn17] But Tertullian later broke with the church over hisMontanist belief that divine prophecy was a living power which did not end withthe apostles but continued into the present day. For this Tertullian was brandeda heretic, and his views rejected as contrary to Christian doctrine. The dreamreflections of Origen (182–251?), a prominent theologian from Alexandria, madeno more of an impact on the Church than did Tertullian’s.18[notes.html#ch06fn18] Origen considered a respect for dreams to be a naturalaccompaniment to a belief in God: “All who accept the doctrine of providence areobviously agreed in believing that in dreams many people form images in theirminds, some of divine things, others being announcements of future events inlife, whether clear or mysterious.” In fact, Origin saw such dreams as anopportunity to strengthen people’s Christian faith and convert skeptical pagans.He said the common experience of divine dreams proved that “there is nothingextraordinary in such things having happened to the prophets when, as the Biblesays, they saw certain marvelous visions, or heard utterances of the Lord, orsaw the heavens opened.” This very strategy was, many centuries later, used withgreat effectiveness by Christian missionaries in Africa, Oceania, and theAmericas, as coming chapters will show. But in the formative years of Christiantheology, it was a decidedly minority view.Surely the most eloquent Christian theologian to affirm the spiritual potentialof dreaming was Synesius (373–423 CE), the bishop of Ptolemais in present-dayLibya.19 [notes.html#ch06fn19] Like Augustine, Synesius developed his Christianteachings by combining Neoplatonic philosophy with biblical teachings, but hisreflections led to a very different view of dreaming. Synesius said, in his Deinsomniis (Concerning Dreams):We, therefore, have set ourselves to speak of divination through dreams, thatmen should not despise it, but rather cultivate it, seeing that it fulfills aservice to life. … [T]he dream is visible to the man who is worth five hundredmedimni, and equally to the possessor of three hundred, to the teamster no lessthan to the peasant who tills the boundary land for a livelihood, to the galleyslave and the common laborer alike, to the exempted and to the payer of taxes.It makes no difference to the god. … And this accessibility to all makesdivination very humane; for its simple and artless character is worthy of aphilosopher, and its freedom from violence gives it sanctity. … Of divination bydreams, each one of us is perforce his own instrument, so much so that it is notpossible to desert our oracle there even if we so desired.The pagan overtones of Synesius’s ideas would inevitably conflict with theefforts of the Church to codify a strict monotheism in Christian belief andpractice. But setting aside doctrinal politics and looking just at the contentof Synesius’s text, it is hard to argue with the phenomenological truth of whathe was describing. Dreams do indeed come to all people, the highest and lowestamong us. They come in “service to life,” contributing to mental, physical, andspiritual well-being. Further, the inner processes that generate dreaming arefirmly and inextricably rooted in human nature. Synesius was not alone among theChristian faithful in holding these views. A deep veneration for dreaming shouldbe recognized as an authentic element in the piety and religious experience ofearly Christianity, even if a contrary attitude came to dominate latertheological discourse.THEOLOGY CONTRA DREAMINGThe consolidation of church authority in the fourth and fifth centuries CEcoincided with the collapse of Rome, as imperial authority finally caved underthe pressure of corruption from within and barbarian invasions from without. Thelong period of social disintegration that followed the empire’s demise providedfertile territory for Christianity’s rapid expansion. Church leaders becameincreasingly adept at providing basic social and economic services in theempire’s former territories, enabling the conversion of huge numbers of newpeople to the faith. The development of Christian dream teachings during these“Middle Ages” was far more eventful than can be summarized here, but a briefconsideration of two especially prominent theologians—Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)and Martin Luther (1483–1546)—provide a sense of how much the leadingauthorities of medieval Christianity were influenced by the earlier skepticismand hostility of Augustine, Jerome, and the desert fathers.Aquinas was a leading figure in the Scholastic movement, an effort by medievaltheologians to integrate Christian doctrine with the newly translated texts ofclassical Greece, particularly the philosophy of Aristotle. The Summa Theologicawas the ultimate compendium of Aquinas’s thought, and after his death it becamethe most authoritative source (other than the Bible) for the core teachings ofthe Roman Catholic Church. The topics of sleep and dreaming appeared in a fewscattered sections of the Summa, and Aquinas treated them with the samefaith-inspired rationality he applied to every other topic.20[notes.html#ch06fn20] Closely following Aristotle’s psychological theory,Aquinas maintained that the only legitimate source of knowledge for humans wasthrough the concrete impressions of their senses. Because sleep is characterizedby a total suspension of the senses, Aquinas concluded that a sleeping mindcould not gain true knowledge nor form good judgments. He granted themetacognitive possibility that occasionally “the common sense is partly freed;so that sometimes, while asleep, a man may judge that what he sees is a dream,discerning, as it were, between things and their images.” But Aquinas insistedon a fundamental deficiency of reason during sleep that could never beovercome—“if a man syllogizes while asleep, when he wakes up he invariablyrecognizes a flaw in some respect.”Aquinas also argued for a theologically reasonable understanding of biblicalpassages describing dream revelations, which he considered a lower but stillvalid means of divine communication. For example, he cited the dreams of Jesus’sfather, Joseph, in the first two chapters of Matthew and explained how an angel(or a demon) could act upon the imagination of a sleeping person to compel himto see true (or deceptive) things. Aquinas devoted a whole article of the Summato the question of dream divination, and argued that “there is no unlawfuldivination in making use of dreams for the foreknowledge of the future, so longas those dreams are due to divine revelation, or to some natural cause inward oroutward, and so far as the efficacy of that cause extends.” Very much likeAristotle, he allowed for the possibility of dreams providing valuable medicalinsights about the “internal dispositions” of the body. But going beyondAristotle, Aquinas affirmed the divine potentiality of dreams according to thecausal power of “God, Who reveals certain things to men in their dreams by theministry of the angels.” And in another departure from the elite-mindedAristotle, Aquinas actually considered the popular experience of propheticdreaming to be a piece of evidence in favor of its authenticity: “It isunreasonable to deny the common experiences of all men. Now it is the experienceof all that dreams are significative of the future.”Another article of the Summa focused on the question we raised at the beginningof the chapter: How should we regard the sexual images and feelings that ariseso often in dreams? It may seem reasonable to suppose that if a person couldgain divine favor for his actions in a dream, he could also earn divine disfavorfor what he does while dreaming, and thus “nocturnal pollution,” or wet dreams,would be evidence of mortal sin. But Aquinas rejected this view. CombiningAristotle with Augustine, he explained that people (celibate monks, for example)were not morally responsible for what happened during their dreams. The loss ofnormal mental functioning during sleep reduced people to a sub-rational statusthat absolved them of religious culpability: “What a man does while he sleepsand is deprived of reason’s judgment is not imputed to him as a sin, as neitherare the actions of a maniac or an imbecile.” The simplest cases of nocturnalpollution were caused, according to Aquinas, by an “excess of seminal humor inthe body” which naturally released itself during sleep to the accompaniment of“phantasms relating to the discharge of those superfluities.” Other wet dreamscould be attributed to the natural effects of sinful thoughts or past sexualexperiences (Augustine being the prime example). The waking thoughts and/oractions might be sinful, but the consequent dreams were not. Still otherdisturbing sexual dreams were caused “without any fault on man’s part, andthrough the wickedness of the devil alone.” Aquinas accepted all thesepossibilities within the compass of his faith-based, logically structuredexplanation. Not as hostile as a desert father nor as enthusiastic as a newconvert, Aquinas developed a rationally balanced theology of dreams thataccepted their occasional physical and spiritual value while clearly definingthem as the products of an inferior state of mind that was perenniallyvulnerable to the temptations of wily demons.Two hundred years later Martin Luther, an Augustinian monk from Germany,rejected the abstruse theological tomes of Aquinas and the Scholastics.21[notes.html#ch06fn21] Putting his faith entirely in the Bible, Luther argued forthe supreme authority of God’s Word over anything taught by the Pope, theChurch, or theologians. Luther’s absolute commitment to the truth andsufficiency of the Bible colored his attitude toward dreaming, and in thefollowing passage (from his commentary on the story of Joseph and the Pharaoh inGenesis 40) he revealed a brief but fascinating window into his own dreamexperience and its relationship to his mission as a Christian reformer:I have often stated that at the beginning of my cause I always asked the Lordnot to send me dreams, visions, or angels. For many fanatical spirits attackedme, one of whom boasted of dreams, another of visions, and another ofrevelations with which they were striving to instruct me. But I replied that Iwas not seeking such revelations and that if any were offered, I would put notrust in them. And I prayed ardently to God that He might give me the suremeaning and understanding of Holy Scripture. For if I have the Word, I know thatI am proceeding on the right way and cannot easily be deceived or go wrong. …With their dreams the fanatics were trying to drive me, some in one way, othersin another. Had I listened to any of them, it would certainly have beennecessary to change the character of my doctrine thirty or forty times. But whenI rejected them all, they kept crying out that I was stubborn and headstrong,and they let me alone. Therefore I care nothing about visions and dreams.Although they seem to have a meaning, yet I despise them and am content with thesure meaning and trustworthiness of Holy Scripture.Luther evidently felt comfortable telling people the story of his demonicnightmares, taking it as a badge of spiritual integrity that he had suffered andovercome such temptations. Consistent with his desire to revive the originalteachings of Christianity, Luther sounded the tones of a desert father inseeking a pure communion with God, far beyond what any dream or vision couldattain. His dream struggles mirrored his waking life struggles with Roman churchofficials who attacked his beliefs and accused him of selfish obstinacy. Just asLuther refused to yield to the “fanatics” tormenting him in his sleep, herefused to yield in matters of faith to papal authority, and thus his dreamstory served as a neat parable of the Protestant movement as a whole (with theadded bonus of associating his opponents with demons). He went on to grant thatdivine revelation in sleep was possible, “but the marks of true dreams must beobserved,” and those marks boiled down to conformity with Holy Scripture—a dreamcould be accepted as true only if it agreed in all essentials with the Bible.But since Christians already had the Bible, this meant that dreams were in factsuperfluous, adding nothing of religious value that was not already availablefrom scripture. Luther denounced the revelation-seeking incubation practices ofcertain Christian contemplatives (“these monks and nuns were very frequentlydeceived by delusions of the devil”), and he advocated the exact oppositepractice of praying against any dreams at all. Never was the line separatingChristian faith from the dreaming imagination more sharply drawn.POPULAR PIETYAnd yet Christians continued to dream. A strong undercurrent of reverence fordreaming survived from the earliest days of the faith all the way through theMiddle Ages. This was most easily seen in the transformation of Asclepiantemples to Christian churches, where the healing and dream incubation ritualscontinued more or less intact from one tradition to the next. The cult ofAsclepius was one of the last pagan religious practices to succumb toChristianity’s ascent, and especially in Greece the Christian Church had tocompete vigorously with the Asclepian temples for people’s spiritual allegiance.The eventual domination of Christianity depended on a pragmatic willingness toaccept popular practices from pre-Christian traditions so long as the ultimateauthority of the Church remained unquestioned.Elsewhere the popular faith found expression in widely circulated stories offantastic dreams and nocturnal visions. The early Anglo-Saxon Christianliterature was filled with such narratives, including dreams of conception andbirth, otherworldly journeys, prophecies of death, visitations from saints,nightmarish temptations, and poetic creations.22 [notes.html#ch06fn22] Dreammanuals proliferated in which the symbolic equations of Artemidorus were mergedwith Christian images, themes, and interpretations. Texts known as SomnialiaDanielis (the “dream keys” of Daniel) circulated widely among Latin Christians,providing interpretations of auspicious or inauspicious dreams relating tohealth, longevity, finances, emotional well-being, and other ordinary concernsof the general population.23 [notes.html#ch06fn23] At the other end of theliterary spectrum, many of the greatest writers of Medieval and RenaissanceChristianity included dramatic dream visions and revelations in their stories.The Divina Commedia of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) recounted three dreams heexperienced during his three nights in Purgatory, each providing valuableguidance in his journey from Hell to Paradise.24 [notes.html#ch06fn24] As apreface to one of the dreams, Dante offered an explanation that echoed Greekphilosophical teachings: in sleep, “the mind, escaped from its submission toflesh and to the chains of waking thought, becomes almost prophetic in itsvision.”Geoffrey Chaucer (1343–1400) told a darkly comic dream fable in the “Nun’sPriest’s Tale.”25 [notes.html#ch06fn25] One day a proud rooster namedChauntecleer awoke from a frightening dream of being killed by a fox. But whenhe described the dream to his wife, Pertelote, he received no comfort; instead,she belittled him for his cowardice. Quoting pagan medical authorities,Pertelote explained that his dream was simply a by-product of bodily distemper.Chauntecleer responded by refering to Macrobius and his category of true dreamvisions. This amusing intellectual conversation between rooster and hen endedwhen Pertelote finally persuaded Chauntecleer to ignore the threat-simulatingdream, forget his unmanly fears, and go forth with his day. Thus, when the foxarrived at the barnyard later that morning, Chauntecleer was easy prey.The plays of William Shakespeare (1564–1616) overflow with dreams and dreaming,from the love-drunk fantasies of A Midsummer Night’s Dream and the politicallyominous nightmares of Richard III to the wonder-working dream magic of TheTempest and the existential soliloquizing of Hamlet.26 [notes.html#ch06fn26] Aprominent theme in the dark tragedy of Macbeth is the intertwining of sleep,dreams, and moral conscience. The famous scene of Lady Macbeth walking andtalking in her sleep (V.i) gives the audience a glimpse into hernightmare-plagued inner world, where she suffers horrible visions of guilt overher bloody deeds in helping her husband seize the throne. For Macbeth’s part,his violent ambition has caused him to suffer “the affliction of these terribledreams that shake us nightly” (III. ii. 20–21). Macbeth admits that just beforehe thrust a dagger into the body of the sleeping king, “methought I heard avoice cry ‘Sleep no more! Macbeth does murder sleep!’ ” (II.ii.49-50). Banquo,who was with Macbeth when they first heard the witches’ prophecy about becomingking, recognizes the ethical dangers of such unholy wishes, which becomeespecially intense in sleep: “Merciful powers, restrain in me the cursedthoughts that nature gives way to in repose” (II.i. 9–11). Although theChristian God is very distant from the bleak Scottish moors where the play isset, Banquo’s prayer reflects an essentially Christian belief about dreaming asa moral battleground between good and evil, social order and individual desire.In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare approaches the subject of dreaming in a muchlighter spirit, though in so doing he moves into deeper philosophical waters.Consider this exchange (I.iv. 49–106), when Romeo is expressing reluctance abouthis friend Mercutio’s plan to sneak into the masquerade ball hosted by theirrivals, the Capulets:Romeo: And we mean well in going to this mask; But ’tis no wit to go.Mercutio: Why, may one ask?Romeo: I dream’d a dream to-night.Mercutio: And so did I.Romeo: Well, what was yours?Mercutio: That dreamers often lie.Romeo: In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.Mercutio: Oh, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comesIn shape no bigger than an agate-stoneOn the fore-finger of an alderman,Drawn with a team of little atomiesAthwart men’s noses as they lie asleep;Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders’ legs,The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,The traces of the smallest spider’s web,The collars of the moonshine’s watery beams,Her whip of cricket’s bone, the lash of film,Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,Not so big as a round little wormPrick’d from the lazy finger of a maid;Her chariot is an empty hazel-nutMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.And in this state she gallops night by nightThrough lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on court’sies straight,O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees,O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tailTickling a parson’s nose as a’ lies asleep,Then dreams, he of another benefice:Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anonDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,And being thus frighted swears a prayer or twoAnd sleeps again. This is that very MabThat plats the manes of horses in the night,And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,That presses them and learns them first to bear,Making them women of good carriage:This is she—Romeo: Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!Thou talk’st of nothing.Mercutio: True, I talk of dreams,Which are the children of an idle brain,Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,Which is as thin of substance as the airAnd more inconstant than the wind.The impetuous Mercutio ricochets from one negative assessment of dreams toanother—first saying dreams are lies, then attributing them to the mischievousinfluences of faeries, then becoming consumed with his own dark evocation ofsexually violent nightmares, and finally dismissing all dreams as products of“an idle brain.” Compared to these wild and self-contradictory rantings, Romeo’ssimple faith in prophetic dreaming seems the more reasonable approach. The exactnature of Shakespeare’s own faith remains uncertain, but in passages like thishe acknowledged traditional folk beliefs about dreams that many of his audiencemembers would have shared, “pagan” teachings that very likely predated thearrival of Christianity in England.Such beliefs could lead to serious trouble, however, and Christian people wereundoubtedly cautious about how, when, and with whom they shared their dreams.The Malleus Maleficarum (The Witches’ Hammer) (1487), the manual used by churchinquisitors in their hunt for witches and heretics, listed dreams as one of theprimary means by which demons attack and seduce people.27 [notes.html#ch06fn27]Anyone who had a reputation as an unusual dreamer could, for that reason alone,fall under suspicion as a witch. Thus a profound split came to characterize theChristian culture of Europe and the Mediterranean. While church officials weredoing their best to dampen oneiric enthusiasm and regulate visionary experience,laypeople maintained a strong but cautiously hidden fascination with dreams andtheir meanings.Christianity branched out in dramatic fashion from this point, with missionaryactivities expanding the faith’s presence into Africa, Oceania, and theAmericas. In the coming chapters we examine the interactions betweenChristianity and the indigenous religious traditions of these regions, each ofwhich had its own precolonial teachings about dreams. In many cases we will findthat dreaming became a contested arena of spiritual authority betweenmissionaries and natives. The Christian split between official hostility andpopular appeal was thereby translated into new settings and dialects, leading toa variety of forced compromises and pragmatic syntheses.Before that, however, we consider the rise of the third great Abrahamicreligion, Islam.SUMMARYIn Christianity’s earliest texts, in the experiences of its martyrs andconverts, and in scattered places throughout the tradition’s later history, wefind clear expressions of the belief that dreams are a legitimate means ofcommunion between humans and God. We also find, especially in later theologicalwritings, warnings against the demon-caused, sexually arousing temptations ofdreaming. Most Christian authorities seem to have accepted the supernaturalorigins of dreams, but as the power of the Church grew these authorities focusedmore on the dangers of demonic nightmares than on the blessings of heaven-sentvisions. In their actual lives and religious practices, ordinary Christianlaypeople have looked to their dreams for various purposes, including prophecy,healing, inspiration, guidance, and reassurance in times of fear. Christianityhas never developed an official method of dream interpretation, but in practicepeople have relied heavily on pre-Christian approaches translated from Greek andRoman sources. The popular interest in dreaming has usually been tolerated byChristian leaders, in pragmatic recognition of the fact that other people’sdreams cannot be easily controlled or extinguished. But the authorities havealmost always insisted on one requirement for Christians trying to interprettheir dreams: any message discerned in a dream must conform to the revealedtruths of the Bible and the teachings of the Church."},{"pageContent":"7ISLAMOne way to think about the different types of dreams reported so far is toconsider them as variations on the theme of reactions to an existential crisis.Visitation and pre-death dreams are the most obvious examples, with their vividevocations of the specter of mortality haunting all human endeavors. Thecross-cultural prevalence of threat-simulating nightmares and death-relateddream visions is no accident, no mere epiphenomenal product of random neuralfirings in the brain. The dark forebodings that characterize the mostintensified forms of dreams consistently have the effect of stimulating greaterexistential self-awareness. This should be recognized as a fundamental fact inour knowledge of human dreaming.Conception dreams arise at the other end of the life cycle, reflecting thewonderful yet frightful moment of a child’s entrance into the world. (Anyone whodoesn’t think of childbirth as an existential crisis has probably never beeninside a hospital’s labor-and-delivery room.) Other crisis-related examplesabound in the world’s religious traditions. During times of suffering andillness, before a make-or-break examination, on the eve of a decisive battle—inall these cases, extraordinarily vivid and memorable dreams reflect a naturalemergency-response system at work in the dreaming imagination, an innatepsychospiritual propensity that every religion considered so far has sought tounderstand, influence, and cultivate. It would be easy to interpret such dreamsas nothing more than wish-fulfillments (e.g., wishing a deceased loved one werestill alive, and thus making up a visitation dream about that person). To besure, humans are wishing and wishful creatures, endlessly seeking satisfactionof their instinctual desires. But we should not underestimate the paradoxicalpower of the dreaming wish to create new waking realities. As both ancientphilosophers and contemporary neuroscientists have taught, the human species isdistinguished by tremendous powers of memory, imagination, and forethought. Insleep and dreams these powers have the potential to expand their functionalrange in ways that enhance the individual’s abilities to meet the challenges ofwhatever waking-life crisis is at hand. The dreams that come in such situationsmay be wish fulfillments, but they are wish fulfillments in the service ofgreater confidence, courage, and vitality.The religious heritage of Islam has drawn deeply from these powers of thedreaming imagination.1 [notes.html#ch07fn1] Like Buddhism and Christianity,Islam has grown to become a global faith with more than a billion practicingmembers, and this chapter highlights only a portion of its rich andsophisticated teachings about the nature and meaning of dreams. As a relativelyyoung religion (founded in the seventh century CE), Islam has preserved numeroussources from its founding era that provide excellent insights into thetradition’s reliance upon the crisis-response potentials of oneiric experience.THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD AND THE QUR’ANThe angel Gabriel first came to Muhammad in a cave on Mount Hira (present-daySaudi Arabia) during the holy month of Ramadan in 610 CE.2 [notes.html#ch07fn2]Muhammad was forty years old at the time, married to a loving wife namedKhadija, and father to several children, stepchildren, and foster children. Inaddition to participating in the polytheistic religious rituals of his city,Muhammad practiced various forms of personal devotion, most often in the cool,dark caves that dotted the Arabian wilderness. Here he would pray, think, sleep,and imagine. He began to have dreams, marvelous visions of hope and promise sofilled with brilliance that they struck him “like the dawn of the morning.” Thenone night, during a month-long retreat in the caves of Mount Hira, he had anexperience that changed him forever. Muhammad was suddenly awakened by thepowerful presence of Gabriel, who appeared beside him and gave him a simpleorder: “Iqra!” (“Recite!” or “Read!”) Terrified, Muhammad initially resisted thecall, but Gabriel’s numinous intensity overwhelmed him and compelled his totalassent. He woke up with the angel’s words still sharp and vivid in his memory,“as if they had written a message in my heart.” Muhammad walked outside, and asecond time he was struck by the divine: Gabriel appeared before him as a hugeform spanning the whole horizon; wherever Muhammad looked, there was the angel,telling him “You are the apostle of God.”Over the next twenty-two years Muhammad continued with his devotional practices,and he was rewarded with a number of additional revelations, all of which hereported to his followers. Some of the revelations were visual, involving lightsas bright as the breaking dawn. Others were entirely auditory, with distinctlyspoken messages and teachings. Still others were bodily perceptions of titanicwaves of power, “like the reverberations of a bell, and that is the hardest onme.” These experiences strained his physical being to its limit: “Never once didI receive a revelation without thinking that my soul had been torn away fromme.” Muhammad came to understand himself as a “Warner” sent by Allah to teachpeople the proper worship of the one God. His writings in the Qur’an (“TheRecitation”) wove together Jewish and Christian scriptures with originaltheological reflections on the human condition and practical teachings directlyresponsive to the conditions and crises faced by the Prophet and his followersin their Arabian context. One theme that Muhammad appropriated from the otherAbrahamic traditions was a reverence for dreaming. In the Qur’an, as in theJewish Torah and the Christian Novum Testamentum, dreams served as a medium bywhich God communicated with His most favored humans. Although Islam,Christianity, and Judaism differ drastically on many other issues, theiroriginal scriptures expressed substantial agreement on the core idea thatdreaming is a valuable source of religious wisdom and inspiration.The text of the Qur’an contains 114 chapters (suras) of varying length andcontent. Unlike Jewish and Christian scriptures, which were produced by multipleauthors from different historical times and cultural backgrounds, the Qur’an wasthe work of a single man, in a single lifetime. The text thus bears a strongstamp of that man’s personality—to learn about Islam is inevitably to learnabout the Prophet Muhammad. Several passages of the Qur’an contain discussionsof dreams and dreaming, and because of the absolute centrality of the Qur’an toMuslim faith these passages have become fundamental to all later Islamic dreamtraditions. What follows are brief synopses of five suras in which dreams play asignificant role.3 [notes.html#ch07fn3]12: Joseph. In this chapter Muhammad gave a condensed version of the story ofJoseph (following the essential outline found in the Torah’s Genesis 37–50).Although much of the material from the Genesis version was removed, the threemajor dream episodes in Joseph’s life all remained, and they combined to make aclear point: dreams, and the ability to interpret them, were an important signof God’s favor. Muhammad started sura 12 with the young Joseph telling hisfather that he had a dream in which “eleven stars and the sun and the moon wereprostrating themselves before me.” Joseph’s father warned the boy not to tellthe dream to his jealous older brothers, who harbored murderous intentionstoward him. Joseph’s father prophesized that his youngest son would “be chosenby your Lord. He will teach you to interpret visions.” The prophecy was borneout later in the sura when Joseph, unjustly imprisoned in Egypt, was asked tointerpret the dreams of two fellow prisoners:One of them said: “I dreamed that I was pressing grapes.” And the other said: “Idreamed that I was carrying a loaf upon my head, and that the birds came and ateof it. Tell us the meaning of these dreams, for we can see you are a man oflearning.” Joseph replied: “I can interpret them long before they are fulfilled.This knowledge my lord has given me, for I have left the faith of those thatdisbelieve in Allah and deny the life to come. I follow the faith of myforefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”Joseph told the first man that his dream meant he would be released and servethe king wine, while the second man’s dream meant he would be crucified, and thebirds would peck at his head. When these predictions came true, Joseph’s skillas a dream interpreter reached the attention of Egypt’s king, who had beentroubled by two dreams of his own, one in which seven fatted cows devoured sevenlean ones, and the other in which seven green ears of corn devoured seven dryones. The king asked his royal advisers to tell him the meaning of these dreams,but they could not do so, saying “It is but an idle dream; nor can we interpretdreams.” Joseph, however, was able to interpret the dreams accurately asanticipations of the future welfare of the land and its people, when seven yearsof plenty would be followed by seven years of famine. The king was pleased withthis interpretation, and as a reward made Joseph his personal servant.Very much like the Genesis version, the Qur’an portrayed Joseph as an exemplaryman of faith and piety, and one clear sign of his close relationship with Godwas his ability to see and interpret revelatory dreams.37. The Ranks. Like sura 12, this one also retells a story found in Genesis.Here the main subject is Abraham, whose life is recounted in Genesis 12–25. TheQur’anic version focused specifically on God’s command to Abraham to sacrificehis only son, Isaac (cf. Genesis 22):[Abraham said] “Grant me a son, Lord, and let him be a righteous man.” We[Allah] gave him news of a gentle son. And when he reached the age when he couldwork with him his father said to him: “My son, I dreamed that I was sacrificingyou. Tell me what you think.” He replied: “Father, do as you are bidden. Allahwilling, you shall find me faithful.” And when they had both surrenderedthemselves to Allah’s will, and Abraham had laid down his son prostrate upon hisface, We called out to him, saying: “Abraham, you have fulfilled your vision.”Thus did We reward the righteous. That was indeed a bitter test.Several points are worth noting here. First is the explicit reference to a dreamas the means by which Abraham received this command; the Genesis version did notemphasize the dream provenance as clearly. Second is the unquestioned assumptionby both Abraham and his son that the dream was a command from Allah. The dreamas Abraham described it had no special markers of divine origin, yet he and hisson immediately agreed that what Abraham has envisioned was ordained by God andmust be done. This leads to the third and theologically most important point.The dream and their interpretation of it led Abraham and his son to “surrenderthemselves to Allah’s will.” This humble obedience is the very heart of theMuslim faith—the absolute trust in God, even to the point of sacrificing one’smost cherished human attachments (“That was indeed a bitter test”). Muhammad’sretelling of the story of Abraham and Isaac in many ways encapsulates the wholeof the Qur’an. Finally, we should note the interesting twist at the end of thestory, which differs quite dramatically from the Genesis version. In sura 37,Abraham was interrupted in the sacrifice of his son by God’s sudden words,“Abraham, you have fulfilled your vision.” Abraham was true to his dream not byliterally enacting it in the physical sacrifice of his son; rather, he fulfillshis vision by a symbolic demonstration of his absolute obedience to God. Thisemphasis on the reality of the symbolic opened the way for later Muslimphilosophical reflection on the different dimensions of truth that may bediscerned via the dreaming imagination.8: The Spoils. This sura described two of Muhammad’s own dream experiences. Hementioned them in the context of telling how in the early years of his missionhe struggled to lead his followers in battle against their opponents—“some ofthe faithful were reluctant. They argued with you [Muhammad] about the truththat had been revealed, as though they were being led to certain death.” Theimminent prospect of dying on a battlefield is an existential crisis of thefirst order, and Muhammad said he prayed to God for help in reviving theconfidence of his followers. God responded as follows:You [Muhammad] were overcome by sleep, a token of His [Allah’s] protection. Hesent down water from the sky to cleanse you and to purify you of Satan’s filth,to strengthen your hearts and to steady your footsteps. Allah revealed His willto the angels, saying: “I shall be with you. Give courage to the believers. Ishall cast terror into the hearts of the infidels. Strike off their heads, maimthem in every limb!”Further on, Muhammad described his experience the night before another armedclash, when he and his people were encamped across a valley from a gathering ofhostile warriors:Allah made them appear to you in a dream as a small band. Had He showed them toyou as a great army, your courage would have failed you and discord would havetriumphed in your ranks. But this Allah spared you. He knows your inmostthoughts.The two dreams reflected the warlike environment in which Muhammad and hisfollowers first established the Muslim faith. Although Muhammad spent much timealone in desert caves praying and meditating, he was also a charismatic warriorwho led his troops through several harrowing battles. The dream experiencesreported in this sura expressed Muhammad’s faith in God’s rousing presenceduring times of violent struggle. In this way, the two dreams echoed passages inthe Torah and the Novum Testamentum where God appeared to His faithful in timesof danger, violence, and despair to offer reassurance and heavenly guidance. Anunusual feature in this sura is the frank acknowledgment that God may use dreamsto deceive the faithful for their own good. Muhammad was grateful that Allahknew his “inmost thoughts,” his secret fear that his army would be defeated, andsent a dream that reassured him. The value of the dream was clearly not in theaccuracy of its representation of physical reality but rather in its inspiringemotional effect on Muhammad—the dream emboldened him to ignore any “realistic”appraisal of his chances and to continue fighting in total confidence ofultimate victory.17: The Night Journey. This sura began with the following line: “Glory be to Himwho made His servants go by night from the Sacred Temple [of Mecca] to thefarther temple [the Throne of Allah] whose surroundings we have blessed, that wemight show him some of Our signs.” The remainder of the chapter described thevisions he saw and the teachings he learned, including many of the key ethical,legal, and ritual principles of the Muslim faith. The text did not specificallysay whether Muhammad’s journey occurred in a waking or dreaming state. Thevisionary quality of the experience and its allusion to an airborne journey tootherworldly realms, combined with the fact that it happened at night, supportsthe belief that it was a dream. But later Muslim commentators have argued thatit was an actual physical transportation to heaven, not just a product ofMuhammad’s sleeping mind. Clearly it was no ordinary dream, and to consider sura17 in connection with dreaming is not to deny the transcendent character ofMuhammad’s night journey but rather to highlight its affinity with otherexperiences of spectacular night vision and brilliant spiritual insight.Sura 53: The Star. From the beginning of his prophecy Muhammad faced thehostility of many Meccan people who wanted to know how exactly his teachingsabout the one God Allah would affect their worship of the other godstraditionally recognized in the city. Many of these deities had been objects ofdeep veneration for countless centuries, and people were understandablyreluctant to accept Muhammad’s claim that Allah was ordering them to abruptlyabandon these ancient practices. According to one of his earliest biographers,at this tense political moment Muhammad experienced a new revelation in whichGod said to him, “Have you considered al-Lat and al-Uzza and Manat, the third,the other? These are the exalted birds whose intercession is approved.” Thethree goddesses, known together as “the daughters of Allah” (banat al-lah), hadlong been worshiped at special temples in Mecca and other cities around Arabia.When Muhammad recited these verses, they were enthusiastically welcomed by theMeccans as a sign that he was acknowledging a harmonious continuity between hisnew religious teachings and traditional Arabian worship practices. Allah wasindeed the supreme creator, to be revered as such, and the goddesses al-Lat,al-Uzza, and Manat were acknowledged to be divine intermediaries between God andthe human realm and thus deserving of devotion in their own right.But then Muhammad had another nocturnal revelation, perhaps his most startlingone yet. Gabriel spoke to him by night and severely chastised him for recitingwords that came not from God but from Satan (shaitan). The earlier verses aboutthe three goddesses must be removed from the Qur’an, Gabriel commanded, and newverses inserted in their place. These new verses (sura 53:23) categoricallyrejected the goddesses as legitimate deities worthy of any attention, dismissingthem as mere projections of human fantasy: “They are naught but names yourselveshave named, and your fathers; God has sent down no authority touching them. Theyfollow only surmise and what their whims desire.” According to this version ofthe composition of sura 53, Muhammad’s fateful decision to reject any worship ofthe three goddesses was prompted by an angelic night vision that corrected hisfoolish compromise and reemphasized the incompatibility of Islam’s monotheisticpurity with the traditional polytheism of Mecca.4 [notes.html#ch07fn4]THE HADITHSBoth during and after Muhammad’s death a number of accounts were written of hiswords and deeds, and these accounts are gathered in the hadiths (such as the onejust mentioned regarding the “satanic verses” behind sura 53). Among the varioussayings of the hadiths are several detailed discussions of dreams and dreaming.5[notes.html#ch07fn5] Although secondary in theological importance to thepassages from the Qur’an, the references to dreaming in the hadiths areextremely significant historically, and they have added important conceptual andtechnical elements to the dream traditions of Islam. In particular, the hadithscontain abundant references to the practice of dream interpretation, and many ofthe interpretive principles enunciated in these passages continue to guide thedream practices of present-day Muslims in countries around the world.The legitimacy of dream interpretation as a religious activity received strongendorsement from the hadiths, most directly in the verses that state: “When thecompanions of the Messenger of God [Muhammad] saw dreams while he was stillalive they would tell him of their dreams and he, for his part, would interpretthem as God willed.” From this point forward, Muslim dream interpretation couldalways justify its legitimacy by reference to early authoritative teachings.Many other hadiths described Muhammad’s interpretations of particular images andsymbols in the dreams of his followers, and other verses told of Muhammad’s owndreams and his interpretations of them. For example, the hadiths reportedseveral dreams in which Muhammad saw his friend ‘Umar, who later became one ofhis successors. The dreams expressed Muhammad’s respect and admiration for thepower of ‘Umar’s faith, and this provided ‘Umar with a kind of divine sanctionfor the day when he assumed religious authority following the death of Muhammad.Another hadith explained that the origin of the athan or “call to prayer” camein a strange state between sleep and wakefulness to two of Muhammad’s followers,who then reported their dreams to Muhammad. The Prophet told them to teach thecall to the strong-voiced Bilal. Ever since then, the same basic song ofgathering has been used in Islam to remind people of the daily times for prayer,focusing the attention of Muhammad’s followers on a total devotion to Allah.According to these texts, Muhammad was sensitive to the practical difficultiesencountered by many of his followers who were trying to interpret their owndreams. The first suggestion Muhammad made was to tell the dream to someoneelse: “A dream rests on the feathers of a bird and will not take effect unlessit is related to someone.” However, people should be careful not to reveal toomuch in public: “Tell your dreams only to knowledgeable persons and loved ones,”he said, and beware of those who will use your dreams against you (like Joseph’sbrothers did against him). Muhammad gave a vivid warning to those who weretempted to abuse the practice of dream interpretation: “Whoever claims to havehad a dream in which he says he saw something he did not shall be ordered [inHell] to tie a knot between two barley grains and will not be able to do so.” Tohelp people increase their chances of having a good dream, Muhammad offeredsuggestions about how to approach sleep in a state of religious purity, with thespecific instruction to try sleeping on the right side. He affirmed that baddreams come from Satan, and he instructed people to refrain from talking aboutsuch nightmares and to offer a prayer instead and “seek refuge with Allah from[the dream’s] evil.”The hadith that reads, “Whoever sees me [the Prophet] in dreams will see me inwakefulness [the Hereafter] for Satan cannot take my shape” has long beenunderstood to mean that a dream in which Muhammad appears as a character isunquestionably a true dream. Every other kind of dream could be a malevolentdeception sent by Satan, but a dream of Muhammad should be accepted withcomplete confidence as an authentic revelation because Satan does not have thepower to assume the shape of God’s Prophet. Perhaps the most oft-quoted hadithon dreams reads, “The good dream is 1/46th of prophecy.” Commentators have longdebated the significance of this exact number (perhaps a doubling of the numberof years [23] between the beginning of Muhammed’s revelation and his death?),but the general sense of the passage seems clear. Dreams are a small butlegitimate source of divine knowledge. This basic attitude in the hadiths—dreamswere not the only source of religious revelation but nevertheless a real andimportant one available to a wide spectrum of people—was consistent with thepositive evaluation of dreams in the Qur’anic verses discussed above and gave amore definitive shaping to the beliefs and practices of later Muslims.The hadiths included two particular dreams of Muhammad’s that are worthmentioning. In the first, the Prophet explained how he interpreted one of hisown dreams:I saw in a dream that I waved a sword and it broke in the middle, and behold,that symbolized the casualties the believers suffered on the Day [of the battle]of Uhud. Then I waved the sword again, and it became better than it had everbeen before, and behold, that symbolized the Conquest [of Mecca] which Allahbrought about and the gathering of the leaders.The broken sword was a striking emblem of military defeat and socialhumiliation, a vivid imagistic reference that would be likely to resonatestrongly with his battle-tested followers. In that context, the suddenlyrestored and improved sword symbolized the transcendent power of Muslim faith.What looked impossible could actually be achieved, what appeared lost could beregained, what seemed fractured could be made whole again—all this was possible,if people were willing to give complete trust in the Almighty. Here again, abrief dream memorably expressed one of the preeminent themes of Islamic beliefand practice.The second dream to note in the hadiths was recounted by A’isha, the womanMuhammad married after the death of his first wife Khadija:Allah’s Apostle said to me [A’aisha], “You were shown to me twice [in my dream]before I married you. I saw an angel carrying you in a silken piece of cloth,and I said to him, “Uncover [her],” and behold, it was you. I said [to myself],“If this is from Allah, then it must happen.” Then you were shown to me, theangel carrying you in a silken piece of cloth, and I said [to him], “Uncoverher,” and behold, it was you. I said [to myself], “If this is from Allah, thenit must happen.”These twin dreams provided Muhammad with divine guidance at a time of major lifetransition (choosing a new wife), sanctioning his choice of A’aisha in a mannervery much like his dreams legitimating the status of his successor ‘Umar,mentioned above. The repetitive nature of the two dreams emphasized the clarityof their message, which was that A’aisha has been presented to Muhammad as agift from God. Not just in war but in love as well, dreams revealed the will ofAllah.CLASSICAL TYPOLOGIES AND INTERPRETATION MANUALSInspired by these teachings from the Qur’an and hadiths, Muslim philosophers andtheologians in subsequent years continued the process of developing newtechniques and conceptual frameworks for the practice of dream interpretation.The most famous of the early dream interpreters was Ibn Sirin, whose name wasreverently attached to dream interpretation manuals for many centuries after hisdeath in 728 CE.6 [notes.html#ch07fn6] One of Ibn Sirin’s key teachings was topay close attention to the personal characteristics of the dreamer. Thefollowing anecdote about his interpretive method appeared in several texts:Two dreamers came to Ibn Sirin within an hour of each other and each had dreamedof being the caller to prayer [muathin]. The first person was told that hisdream foretold that he would perform the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. The secondman, who seemed to be of a baser character, was told that he would be accused ofa theft. [His] pupils then questioned how Ibn Sirin could come up with suchradically different interpretations for the same dream. His response was thatthe character of each dreamer was evident from his appearance and demeanor.Therefore, the first one’s dream evoked the Qur’anic verse “Proclaim to thepeople a solemn pilgrimage” (20:28) since he was clearly pious. The second man’sdream evoked the verse “Then a crier called after them, O company of travelers[Joseph’s brothers], you are surely thieves” (12:70).Ibn Sirin’s reference to specific scriptural passages reflected the fact thatMuslims were, and continue to be, thoroughly steeped from an early age in thewords of the Qur’an. In light of the continuity factor between waking life anddream content, it is quite sensible to ground one’s interpretations in athorough knowledge of the most important religious scriptures in the dreamer’sculture. Memorization of Qur’anic verses has long been a central feature ofMuslim education, and Ibn Sirin’s interpretive strategy relied heavily onpeople’s intimate familiarity with the language, characters, and themes of theQur’an. He further emphasized that a dream’s meaning could not be determinedwithout reference to the personality characteristics of the dreamer. He rejecteda “one size fits all” interpretation for dream symbols and taught that theirmeanings always depended on the personality and life circumstances of thedreamer. This approach corresponded closely to that of Artemidorus in theOneirocritica, which was translated into Arabic in 877 CE and wasenthusiastically incorporated into the continuing development of Muslim dreamtheory and practice.Here is the point where Muslim traditions begin to expand beyond their Christianand Jewish counterparts. As we discussed in the previous chapter, during itsmedieval period Christianity effectively repudiated dreaming as a legitimatesource of divine revelation by increasingly emphasizing the potential fordemonic temptation in dreams. Although spiritually oriented dream traditionscontinued and in some cases even flourished at the level of popular Christianpractice, the attitude of theologians and church officials from Augustine andJerome to Aquinas and Luther was generally dismissive of dreams and theirinterpretation. Judaism did not suffer this kind of decline in the religiousauthority of dreams, and in fact philosophers like Moses Maimonides and theQabbalistic mystics continued to develop creative new ways of conceptualizingthe revelatory power of dreams. But Judaism never achieved anything like thegeographic spread of Islam (from the Atlantic to the border of China in just itsfirst hundred years), nor did Judaism ever produce the kind of spectacularefflorescence of scientific and philosophical discovery that occurred in theClassical Era of Islamic history from the ninth to thirteenth centuries CE. TheMuslim science of dream interpretation known as tabir (literally, “carryingacross to the other side of a river”) emerged in this period as a dynamic bodyof knowledge integrating Islamic faith with the classical heritage of the Greeksand Romans.7 [notes.html#ch07fn7] Nothing emerged in Judaism or Christianity torival the breadth and sophistication of this tradition.The Muslim teachings of this era revolved around the notion of Alam al-mithal, arealm of images between the material and spiritual worlds in which the humansoul could journey either in waking visions or nocturnal dreams.8[notes.html#ch07fn8] Within Alam al-mithal the soul could interact with thesouls of the deceased, gain prophetic knowledge of the future, and receivedivine guidance. The philosopher Ibn Arabi (1164–1240), who devised a grandmetaphysical system merging Islamic theology with Greek philosophy, taught thatthe imaginative powers experienced in Alam al-mithal could be activelycultivated and were ultimately capable of creating reality itself (taking thewish-fulfilling process to its ontological extreme).9 [notes.html#ch07fn9]Synthesizing many different oneiric sources, Ibn Arabi constructed a three-parttypology of dreaming that established the basic framework used throughout laterMuslim history. The first was an “ordinary” dream, produced by the imaginationwhen it took experiences from daily life and magnified them as in a mirror,reflecting in a distorted symbolic fashion people’s thoughts and feelings. Thesecond and much more significant type of dream drew its material not from dailylife but from the “Universal Soul,” a source of knowledge closely associatedwith the faculty of abstract reasoning. “Universal Soul” dreams revealedfundamental truths about reality, although like the first type of dream theywere distorted by the imperfect mirror of the human imagination. Interpretationwas therefore required to discover what the symbolic images meant. The third andfinal type of dream involved a direct revelation of reality, with no distortionor symbolic mediation—a clear vision of divine truth, most likely granted to aperson of pure character and steadfast faith.A further elaboration of this three-part typology appeared in the monumentalMuqaddimah (An Introduction to History) written by the philosopher Ibn Khaldun(1332–1402).10 [notes.html#ch07fn10] He explained the different types of dreams:Real dream vision is an awareness on the part of the rational soul in itsspiritual essence, of glimpses of the forms of events. … This happens to thesoul [by means of] glimpses through the agency of sleep, whereby it gains theknowledge of future events that it desires and regains the perceptions thatbelong to it. When this process is weak and indistinct, the soul applies to itallegory and imaginary pictures, in order to gain [the desired knowledge]. Suchallegory, then, necessitates interpretation. When, on the other hand, thisprocess is strong, it can dispense with allegory. Then, no interpretation isnecessary, because the process is free from imaginary pictures. … One of thegreatest hindrances [to this process] is the external senses. God, therefore,created man in such a way that the veil of the senses could be lifted throughsleep, which is a natural function of man. When that veil is lifted, the soul isready to learn the things it desires to know in the world of Truth. At times, itcatches a glimpse of what it seeks. … Clear dream visions are from God.Allegorical dream visions, which call for interpretation, are from the angels.And “confused dreams” are from Satan, because they are altogether futile, asSatan is the source of futility. This is what “dream vision” really is, and howit is caused and encouraged by sleep. It is a particular quality of the humansoul common to all mankind. Nobody is free from it. Every human being has, morethan once, seen something in his sleep that turned out to be true when heawakened. He knows for certain that the soul must necessarily have supernaturalperception in sleep. If this is possible in the realm of sleep, it is notimpossible in other conditions, because the perceiving essence is one and itsqualities are always present. God guides toward the truth.Ibn Khaldun refined the philosophical and theological foundations of Ibn Arabi’stypology, introducing a physiological notion into the religious discourse. Inhis view, the state of sleep detached people from their external senses,liberating their rational souls from their bodies and enabling them to gainglimpses of transcendent truth. This same theme ran through Platonic andNeoplatonic thinking about dreams, and it seems likely that Ibn Khaldun wasfamiliar with Graeco-Roman philosophical theories and used them to enrich hisown understanding. The distinctive feature in Ibn Khaldun’s theory was that Godintentionally created sleep as an opportunity for humans to “lift the veil ofthe senses” and gain access to divine realities and higher forms of knowing.Dreaming appeared in this light as one of God’s gifts to humankind, an innatesource of spiritual insight potentially available to all people.The foregoing is only the briefest of surveys of the vast wealth of Islamicdream teachings from the classical era. Although we do not know how many peoplebelieved in these mystical ideas or used Ibn Sirin’s manuals to interpret actualdreams, the numerous references in both elite and popular literatures certainlysuggests a broad Muslim acceptance of dreaming as an integral element in theirfaith.ISTIKHARAAt the level of popular practice, pious Muslims had every reason to feelconfident in looking to their dreams for divine guidance. Of course, peoplealways had to be cautious regarding the seductive deceptions of demons and jinn,but the Islamic tradition provided several trustworthy means of focusing thedreaming imagination and heightening its receptivity to heavenly influence. Oneof these means is known as istikhara, which is essentially the Muslim form ofdream incubation.11 [notes.html#ch07fn11] Recall the hadiths in which Muhammadcounseled his followers on pre-sleep rituals and prayers to elicit revelatorydreams; the practice of istikhara carried those teachings forward, developingthem over the centuries into a widely used method of human-divine communication.The term istikhara comes from the root word khayr, which means “beneficence.” Itrefers to an effort to consult God and ask for the blessing of His knowledge andguidance. In pre-Islamic Arabia, people regularly practiced divination by suchmeans as shooting arrows at targets and observing the flight of birds. Thesemethods were forbidden in the Qur’an, and istikhara became the religiouslyacceptable substitute.12 [notes.html#ch07fn12] It could be used either inwaking, in which case the divine response came in an intuitive “inclination ofthe heart,” or before sleeping, in which case a positive or negative answer camein a dream.The practices of istikhara became increasingly elaborate and variable over time,but the core principles of the ritual have survived throughout Muslim historyand into the present day. Istikhara may be practiced anywhere, though manyauthorities favored spiritually charged locations like mosques, graves, thetombs of saints, and of course caves. Cleansings, ablutions, and prayers for theforgiveness of sins were performed beforehand. If these purifying preparationswere insufficient, the ritual would not work; a person whose mind was disturbedand preoccupied by worldly matters would, according to tradition, be incapableof perceiving any divine presence in his or her dreams. After thesepreliminaries, the individual was instructed to recite the following prayer:My God, I entreat You to show me through knowledge that which is blessed for me.I entreat You to give me strength; Your strength is enough for everything. Ientreat You for the grace and favor of showing me which way is the blessed way;You are all omnipotent, I am powerless; You are omniscient, I am ignorant. Youknow all the secrets of the unknown. My God, if the result of this task (thetask is here stated) is of those that are beneficial for my religion, my life,and my after life, then make it easy for me and destine it. My God, if theresult of this task is harmful for my religion, life, and after life, then makeme turn away from it, distance me from it, and do not destine it. Wherever itmay be, predestine for me that which is beneficial. Then make me satisfied withthis benefit.The individual then lay down on his or her right side, repeating the name ofAllah until falling asleep. The dreams that occurred in response to theseincubation techniques were interpreted in fairly straightforward ways. Forexample, a dream of seeing a religious leader or a scene of tranquility or thecolors white or green was interpreted as boding well for the issue at hand,whereas a dream of seeing unpleasant people or scenes of ugliness and strife orthe colors black, blue, yellow, or red was taken as a bad omen. Istikhara wasrecommended only for spiritually important concerns that were uncertain andanxiety-provoking, such as a marriage choice, an impending journey, a legaldecision, or a military conflict. No less an authority than Ibn Khaldun devisedan istikhara practice that involved reciting what he called “special dreamwords” while falling asleep to help maintain a degree of conscious awareness ofhis desire to receive divine wisdom.13 [notes.html#ch07fn13] He said, “With thehelp of these words, I have myself had remarkable dream visions, through which Ilearned things about myself I wanted to know.”SUFI VISIONSBoth Ibn Arabi and Ibn Khaldun were deeply influenced by Sufism, a mysticalmovement within Islam that promoted an extraordinarily intense personalrelationship with the divine.14 [notes.html#ch07fn14] In their asceticlifestyles and contemplative devotions, the Sufis turned their backs on thecosmopolitan distractions of the Muslim Empire, seeking instead to annihilatetheir ordinary human selves, purify their souls, and become worthy of arevelation of God’s living presence. Sufis were not entirely opposed to theinterest in science, rationality, and knowledge seeking that characterized manyphilosophers and theologians in the Muslim Middle Ages, but they did assert thehigher Islamic value of personal religious experience. Sufism branched into manydifferent schools that spread throughout the Muslim world, each drawing itsprimary inspiration from some aspect of Muhammad’s mystical experiences andteachings as recorded in the Qur’an. For instance, the ninth-century-CE Sufivisionary al-Tirmidhi interpreted the verses in sura 10 about God blessing hisfaithful with good tidings (bushra) as an affirmation of the importance ofprophetic dreaming: “The dream of the faithful is God’s word spoken to him inhis sleep.”15 [notes.html#ch07fn15] In his spiritual autobiography, al-Tirmidhidescribed a number of dreams, visions, and mystical experiences that brought himever closer to a full communion with the divine. By virtue of his exceptionalconcentration and ascetic tranquility he was granted clear visions that requiredno interpretation, such as the following:While praying one night, I was overtaken by deep weariness, and as I put my headon the prayer rug, I saw a huge and empty space, a wilderness unfamiliar to me.I saw a huge assembly with an embellished seat and a pitched canopy the clothingand covering of which I cannot describe. And as if it were conveyed to me: “Youare taken to your lord.” I entered through the veils and saw neither a personnor a form. But as I entered through the veils, awe descended upon my heart. Andin my dream I knew with certitude that I was standing in front of Him. After awhile I found myself outside the veil. I stood by the opening of the veil,exclaiming: “He has forgiven me!” And I saw that my breath relaxed of the fear.What seemed at first to be a failure of effort (falling asleep during prayer)turned into a full-blown mystical encounter with God. Unlike the Christianreformer Martin Luther, who could not tell which dreams were from God and whichfrom the devil, al-Tirmidhi was confident in the heavenly origin of this dreambecause of the traditional Muslim principle that Satan cannot assume the form ofthe Prophet nor of Allah. Al-Tirmidhi’s dreams could thus be explored as anopening to greater spiritual insight, a path complementary with other forms ofdevotional practice used by Sufis in the waking state. The sense of relief hefelt at the end of the dream (during which he had perhaps been holding hisbreath or physically paralyzed) completed the fulfillment of his wish, theachievement of his ardent spiritual desire—to stand, pure of soul, before God.Muhammad’s “Night Journey” from sura 17 naturally attracted great attention inSuficircles, where it served as a kind of symbolic template for new mysticaladventures. Shamsoddin Lahiji, a Persian poet from the fifteenth century CE,wrote of a visionary dream that taught him a surprisingly modern-soundingcosmological truth:One night, after prayers were finished and the liturgical recitation prescribedfor the nocturnal hours, I continued to meditate. Absorbed in ecstasy, I had avision. There was a khanqah [Sufilodge], extremely lofty. It was open, and I wasinside the khanqah. Suddenly I saw that I was outside. I saw the entireuniverse, in the structure it presents, consists of light. Everything had becomeone color, and all the atoms of all the beings proclaimed “I am God” each in themanner proper to its being and with the force particular to each. I was unableto interpret properly what manner of being had made them proclaim this. Havingseen these things in my vision, an intoxication and an exaltation, a desire andan extraordinary delectation were born within me. I wanted to fly in the air,but I saw that there was something resembling a piece of wood at my feet whichprevented me from taking flight. With violent emotion, I kicked the ground inevery possible manner until this piece of wood let go. Like an arrow shootingforth from the bow, but a hundred times stronger, I rose and moved into thedistance. When I arrived at the first Heaven, I saw that the moon had split, andI passed through the moon. Then returning from this state and absence, I foundmyself again present.16 [notes.html#ch07fn16]The sensation of brilliant light is a familiar one in religiously meaningfuldreaming, and in Lahiji’s case it generated an insight into the fundamentalnature of the universe—all is light. God’s creation is, in all its multicoloreddiversity, the ultimate expression of a single pure brilliance. Sufis likeLahiji believed that the human faculty of visual perception was active in bothwaking and dreaming, and in its highest state could provide visions of pureluminescence, indicating the living presence of God in one’s immediateexperience.Many Sufis have used dreams to guide them in the choice of a pir who will servethem as spiritual guide and healer. Sufi teachings are traditionally conveyed inthe context of a close master-disciple relationship. The Sufi path often beginswith a powerful dream in which the disciple sees a venerable but unknownpir—after awakening, the disciple must find that same teacher in waking life andpledge total devotion to him. The pir then becomes a private counselor whomonitors the disciple’s spiritual progress, using dreams as a valuable source ofinformation. In some cases, the discipleship may transpire entirely withindreaming, as happens with Muslim women who, having little opportunity fortraveling in public, develop instead a relationship with a pir in their dreams,following his teachings as seriously as if they came in waking.DREAMS IN CONTEMPORARY ISLAMThe basic ideas about dreaming found in the Qur’an and the hadith are still aliving influence in the contemporary Muslim world.17 [notes.html#ch07fn17] Inpresentday Iran, for example, popular magazines publish columns in which readerssend in reports of strange dreams along with details about important eventsaround the time of the dream, and Muslim psychiatrists then provide briefinterpretations and practical advice. In Jordan, a recent survey of collegestudents found that one in five had personally experienced a dream of the jinnor Shaytan. Cases of jinn possession via bad dreams and nightmares are wellknown in that country, and ritual specialists are available to exorcise thedisturbing spirits. Sufis in contemporary Egypt speak of soul travel viadreaming in terms virtually identical with those used by Ibn Khaldun more thansix hundred years before. In Pakistan, Sufis continue to find dreaming amysterious source of guidance in their quest for a pir, no matter that the questnow takes place in a modern technological context—in one case a man had anextremely vivid and realistic dream in which he found himself leafing through atelephone book, looking for the number to ring up his pir.Islam has not been immune to political appropriation of the dreamingimagination. Mollah Omar, leader of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan,reportedly dreamed in 1994 that Muhammad appeared to him in a dream andinstructed him “to take action and save Afghanistan from corruption and foreignpowers.”18 [notes.html#ch07fn18] Such a case highlights the potential dangers ofan absolute belief in the truthfulness and authority of dreams of the Prophet.Islamic dream beliefs also appear to have played a significant role among theAl-Qaeda group in Afghanistan who planned and executed the 9/11 attacks on theU.S. in 2001. In a video released in December of that year, the Al-Qaeda membersare shown discussing and interpreting one another’s dreams in relation to theirlong-planned attack, seeking favorable omens and encouraging prophecies,although limits were placed on how far their discussion was allowed to go.19[notes.html#ch07fn19] When a young man described his dream of a tall building inAmerica, the group’s leader, Osama bin Laden, said, “At that point I was worriedthat maybe the secret would be revealed if everyone starts seeing it in theirdreams. So I closed the subject.”Perhaps it would be best if we all closed the subject. A strong argument can bemade that religious fanatics of all varieties—Hindu, Christian, Jewish,Muslim—are the principal cause of the contemporary world’s woeful condition. Ifdreaming fuels the mad passions and demagogical persuasiveness of such people,then maybe it, too, should be condemned. History has seen far too much violenceand bloodshed perpetrated in the name of heavenly visions and prophetic dreams,and humankind may not be able to survive many more of them. Perhaps we shouldleave the ruminations of our sleeping minds to themselves, and focus ourformidable powers of reason exclusively on the real-life concerns of the wakingworld.As sensible as that sounds, I cannot agree. The problem with a purelyrationalist approach is that it is just not psychologically possible. Humans area dreaming species—history and science join together in confirming this simplefact. If the goal is to develop realistic solutions to urgent global problems,it makes no sense to pretend that so radical a change—a people withoutdreams!—could ever be achieved, short of a totalitarian regime of mind control.The idea that we could somehow do without the dreaming imagination strikes me asa fundamentally anti-human fantasy, as if the way to save the world was tochange people into soulless logic machines. No one who respects the wonderfullychaotic powers of human creativity could make such an implausible proposal. Weare better advised to follow those teachers in Islam and other traditions whoshow us how to integrate rational analysis and skeptical self-criticism with afaithful openness to the consciousness-enhancing impulses of dreaming. Despitethe perennial risk of political abuse—and no tradition is innocent ofthat—dreaming remains an essential faculty of the human psyche, as much now asit ever has been.SUMMARYThroughout its history, from its prophetic origins in desert visions to itsmodern status as the world’s second-largest faith, Islam has strongly affirmedthe religious power of dreaming. The Prophet Muhammad expressed great interestin the revelatory potential of dreaming, and Muslims ever since have followedhis advice to pay close attention to their dreams. Building on the traditions ofJudaism and Christianity, and incorporating several elements from Greek andRoman teachings, Islamic dream theory grew into a full-fledged science in theclassical era of Muslim scholarship. According to Ibn Khaldun’s version of thistheory, dreams are formed in one of three ways: by God, by the angels, or by theDevil. The first is a clear dream vision, and it functions to provide trueknowledge, guidance, and inspiration. The second is an allegorical dream, and ituses images and symbols from the human mind to express its divine messages. Thethird is a confused dream that has no meaning and is merely sent to tempt andmislead the dreamer. Only the second type of dream requires interpretation, andthrough the centuries Muslims have written numerous books to help people analyzethe meanings of their allegorical dreams. Most of these books emphasize theimportance of contextualizing the dream within the specific life circumstancesof the dreamer; associating the dream’s images to verses from the Qur’an; andsharing the dream only with competent, respectful people whom the dreamertrusts."},{"pageContent":"8RELIGIONS OF AFRICAOf all the dream beliefs and practices considered so far, the one that appearsstrangest to many people is paradoxical interpretation. From a modernperspective, it seems the height of superstitious absurdity to claim that adream of one thing means that the opposite will happen in waking life. Such anidea flagrantly violates the scientific principle of falsification—nothing canever disprove it. If a dream can mean one thing or its opposite, then there isno check on arbitrary interpretations, no protection against consciously orunconsciously deceitful claims. Ultimately the process becomes nothing but a congame: heads I win, tails you lose. The fact that most religious and culturaltraditions make some use of paradoxical dream interpretations is, in this view,an indication that professional interpreters everywhere have been motivated bythe same hucksterish desire to protect their authority as the final arbiters ofa dream’s meaning, even to the extent of creating hermeneutic escape hatches forthemselves in case they run into trouble.All this is true, and yet not entirely so. The evidence in this book indicatesthat the sharing and interpreting of dreams can be highly charged with micro-and macro-political conflict, but it would be a mistake to think of paradoxicalinterpretation in those terms alone. Paradoxical interpretations tap into agenuine truth about the dreaming mind, namely, the binary quality of certainimages and themes. Few cognitive scientists would dispute that an oppositionallogic governs many of the basic metaphorical categories used in waking thoughtand language. If we follow the continuity principle, it makes sense that much ofdream content revolves around the interaction of exactly these kinds ofcategories. Given that the meaning of any such term depends on the contrast withits opposite (“up” makes no sense except in opposition to “down,” “light” ismeaningless except in relation to “dark,” “death” is the converse of “life”),the potential for each to evoke its conceptual shadow in a dream is real andworth taking into interpretive consideration.KING SHABAKA’S PARADOXICAL INTERPRETATIONNor should we concede the point that paradoxical dream interpretations arealways weapons of political abuse. Consider one of the oldest surviving storiesof dreaming in African history, that of King Shabaka, the Ethiopian monarchwhose vast empire stretched as far north as Egypt in the eighth century BCE.1[notes.html#ch08fn1] As recorded in the Histories of Herodotus, Shabaka decidedto voluntarily withdraw his forces from Egypt and return to his Ethiopian homebecause of an oracle-confirming dream:The final deliverance from the Ethiopian came about (they said) as follows: hefled away because he had seen in his sleep a vision, in which it seemed to himthat a man came and stood by him and counseled him to gather together all thepriests in Egypt and cut them asunder in the midst. Having seen this dream, hesaid that it seemed to him that the gods were foreshowing him this to furnish anoccasion against him, in order that he might do an impious deed with respect toreligion, and so receive some evil either from the gods or from men: he wouldnot however do so, but in truth (he said) the time had expired, during which ithad been prophesied to him that he should rule Egypt before he departed thence.For when he was in Ethiopia the Oracles which the Ethiopians consult had toldhim that it was fated for him to rule Egypt fifty years: since then this timewas now expiring, and the vision of the dream also disturbed him, Sabacos[Shabaka] departed out of Egypt of his own free will.Shabaka interpreted the violent images in his dream as a test of faith. Thedream itself did not convey a divine message; rather, the religious value of theexperience depended on his proper interpretation of it. Shabaka held the dreamto a higher standard of morality, and from that perspective he realized thedream’s true meaning could only be the opposite of its literal appearance.Instead of executing the local priests (which would have been fairly standardpractice for most Mesopotamian kings), Shabaka did the opposite: he gave controlof their country back to them and departed for his home, free in spirit andclean of conscience. Paradoxically interpreted, Shabaka’s dream gave him awarning not to offend the gods and not to extend the time of his empire beyondits proper limit. Thus we have at least one report in the history of worldreligions of a dream turning a ruler away from war and the aggressive dominationof others. In ancient Ethiopia, perhaps the oldest of all continuous humannations, King Shabaka looked beyond the literal, conventional meaning of hisdream to discern an alternative dimension of significance more closely attunedto his religious faith, even if it seemed “paradoxical” from a worldlyperspective.THE DARK CONTINENTThis chapter marks a major shift in the book’s approach to the comparative studyof dreaming and religion. Instead of examining literate, large-scale societieswith extensive records of their history, we now survey a scattering of oral,smaller-scale communities that have been colonized and subjugated by morepowerful others (primarily Christians and Muslims). Very little can be knownwith certainty about the earliest religious traditions of these peoples. Thelack of written documents and the active suppression of indigenous cultures bythe colonizing powers have left us few reliable resources for understandingtheir pre-contact beliefs about dreaming. A further complication is that some ofthe best records of those pre-contact beliefs come from the earliestmissionaries and colonial government officials who witnessed the local culturein relatively intact form but who were also actively working to persuade orforce the indigenous people to give up their old beliefs and adopt new ones. Acomparative project such as this must proceed very carefully here, alwayskeeping in mind the biases of the authors and the hostile context in which theygathered their information.Fortunately, we have developed a few resources of our own that can help navigatethrough these dangerous methodological shoals. The preceding chapters onChristianity and Islam provide an essential preparation for analyzing thecomplex and often violent interplay of indigenous and colonial dream traditionsthroughout the world. Whatever we may or may not be able to say aboutpre-contact indigenous cultures, we are still in a good position to identify theways in which Christianity and Islam have themselves been forced to adapt theirdream views in the process of trying to convert other people. Furthermore, everychapter in this book has identified pre-and post-dream practices that do notdepend on writing or literary culture, giving us several working hypotheses touse in approaching the religious dream practices of Africa, Oceania, and theAmericas. Many excellent, highly self-reflective anthropological studies areavailable that provide trustworthy knowledge on indigenous cultures past andpresent, and the evidence of contemporary neuroscience can strengthen ourconfidence in any finding that relates to basic patterns of brain-mindfunctioning in sleep. All this will help in overcoming the methodologicalchallenges posed by the remaining chapters of the book. It should also be saidthat challenges like these are opportunities for gaining new knowledge, and Ibelieve the study of dreams can provide a unique perspective on the recenthistory of indigenous religions. During times of traumatic cultural dislocation,the people of these traditions have repeatedly turned to their dreams forguidance, hope, and consolation. It is in such “contact situations” that we seethe crisis-response quality of dreaming developed into a vital source ofcollective survival and community adaptation.According to the story of origins told by modern Western evolutionary science,Homo sapiens first appeared in Africa approximately two hundred thousand yearsago, branching off from a line of primates (Homo neanderthalensis, Homo erectus,Homo habilis) whose African roots reached back at least two million years. Somereligious believers, including a majority of Christians in the contemporaryUnited States, do not accept the evolutionary story of human origins, and that,of course, is their right. But rejecting evolution means rejecting so manybasic, commonsense facts about the natural world that it quickly leads to anintellectual dead end. For the study of dreams, evolution is a necessary contextin which to analyze and evaluate our findings, even if we also recognize thatevolutionary theory is not a perfect or all-embracing conceptual resource andshould be supplemented by other perspectives.2 [notes.html#ch08fn2]To continue the evolutionary story, the line of Homo sapiens who represent ourancestors began migrating out of Africa starting around 50,000 BCE. As theyspread, they very likely encountered populations of other Homo species who hadleft Africa in earlier times and settled in Europe and Asia. The new waves ofHomo sapiens may have sexually mingled with their hominid cousins, so thatsomething of their genetic identity continues in us. Whether or not that istrue, the older species were soon driven to extinction. By 10,000 BCE, Homosapiens had spread to, and become the top predator within, every habitableregion on the planet. It is important to note that groups of humans were alsocontinuously moving back into Africa during this time of rapid geographicexpansion. This means that we will never be able to identify a “pure” Africantradition of dreams, religion, or anything else. But that is not the goal here.Rather, the aim is to explore African religious traditions as a further sourceof insight into the fundamental patterns and potentialities of human dreaming.Evolutionary theory gives us good reason to consider Africa to be the earliestancestral environment of humankind, and it would certainly strengthen ourcomparative analysis to find dream phenomena in Africa akin to what we havefound in other parts of the world.DIVINERS AND ANCESTORSAfrican traditions have long recognized the centrality of vision in the dreamingprocess, with some groups like the Zulu of South Africa using the same word(iphupho) to refer to both sleeping dreams and waking visions. For the Temne ofWest Africa, dreaming enables the development of extraordinary powers of visionwhich professional diviners are capable of using for healing and prophecy.3[notes.html#ch08fn3] According to one Temne diviner, the mystical gift of “foureyes” (e-for y-anle) comes from God in dreams:Anyone who dreams is a person God [K-uru] gives eyes to see. So they’re thesame. Diviners dream more than most people—they have prophecies that come true.In diviners’ dreams, they’re in perfect control. But there are ordinary peoplewho sweat after dreaming. There are people who dream and see spirits. If theywake up they have to be helped or they’ll die. When someone dreams, what happensto him is just like noru [the waking world]. If he comes across “bad people”[witches] and they put medicine in his eyes, he’ll get four eyes. It’s somethinglike when we’re near death. I don’t have four eyes now, but I do when I sleep.There are other four eyes that people are born with. These people, if God saysthey’ll have a long life, nobody can challenge them. Before people die theydream a lot, and some even dream their death.The diviner said all this in reply to an anthropologist’s question about whatkinds of people experience especially powerful dreams. “Four eyes” was his termfor an intensification of dreaming vision, something that could be verydangerous if a person was not properly treated and ritually protected in wakinglife. To gain four eyes involved making a pact with malevolent spirits andmoving perilously close to the land of death. If you survived, the dreams gaveyou the power to communicate with other spirits, heal the sick, and forecast thefuture.For the Yansi of Central Africa the word for dreams is ndoey, a collective nounthat also refers to a beard (the rarely used singular word londoey refers to asingle hair in a beard).4 [notes.html#ch08fn4] This gives the sense of eachindividual dream as a part of a larger whole of living dream experience. TheYansi make a basic distinction between dreams that are relatively trivial andinsignificant, mere ndoey mutwe, “dreams of the head,” and those that revealprophetic visions of the future (ndoey ndeag). The latter may be positive ornegative in their precognitive anticipations. In the case of nightmares, theYansi use various rituals to avert the possibly harmful consequences. When theywake up each morning they tell their dreams to their spouses and family members,checking for warning signs about possible threats they might be facing in thecoming day and thinking about how to organize their prayers and ritualsaccordingly.Swahili-speaking Bantu people of Eastern and Central Africa also distinguishbetween ordinary and extraordinary types of dreams. According to a leader of theJamaa movement, a contemporary synthesis of Christian and African religiousteachings from the Congo River region, the difference lies in the presence ofmawazo, “spiritual powers”:Those mawazo in dreams: They are, so to speak, the mawazo of God as they arepresent in the soul of man. … So, there are dreams that come from man alone, anddreams that come from God to teach man, to make him understand how God loves. …Therefore the dream we receive from the mawazo of God, the dream that comes fromGod, we may take as mawazo, yes. Because God has thought out and given thedream. … But the dream that comes only from us: this is the second case. We havea dream that comes from us, the dream we have at night. One dream we receive asa holy dream, the one we regard as mawazo coming from God; that’s how we callit, yes, that sort of dream is mawazo. Another dream is just a dream, senselessthings that come from man alone, yes.5 [notes.html#ch08fn5]Later in this interview the Jamaa leader explained that mawazo were seeds ofthought and potentialities of future reality, ultimately rooted in the infinitecreativity of God. Before humans were created, they were mawazo in the mind ofGod. Thanks to the emergence of mawazo in certain extraordinary dreamexperiences, humans gained the ability of divine communication and enhancedspiritual power. These dreams were considered very different from those “human”dreams with little or no mawazo that generated no meaningful action orsignificant consequences in the waking world.The African continent is home to thousands of different communities of peoplewho live in complex webs of relationship with one another’s languages, culturaltraditions, and genetic stock. Dreaming has woven its way into those webs sothoroughly that African religions cannot be understood without an awareness oftheir dream beliefs and practices. This is especially true regarding ancestralvisitation dreams, which for the vast majority of Africans are the most tangiblemeans of interacting with spiritual beings and realities. To dream of a deceasedfamily member is to be reminded of the dead person’s ongoing presence in wakinglife. The dead may be gone in body, but they remain alive in spirit. Dreamingboth proves their continued existence and provides a natural conduit for them tocommunicate with those still living in the physical world. Visitation dreams area central feature of religious life for most African peoples, a fact that shedsan interesting light on the nature of history in Africa. It would be wrong tosay that African peoples do not care about history just because they haverelatively few written documents from the past. By all accounts, Africans arekeenly aware of how the past influences the present—their historical awarenessemerges in, and is sustained by, their dreaming. Their dreams of deceased lovedones strongly encourage them to remain conscious of past traditions, ancestralteachings, and spiritual origins, all with an eye toward enhancing futureprosperity. Dreams are agents of historically motivated action that inspirepeople to conduct themselves in their present lives as the bearers oftime-honored communal wisdom.In most African communities, a few particular people develop special skills inspirit communication, healing, and prophecy. “Diviner” is the shorthand term wewill use, though “shaman” would also be accurate (but anachronistic). If wedescribed them using contemporary terminology, we would say they combine theabilities of doctor, psychotherapist, minister, legal arbitrator, politicalpundit, master of ceremonies, and clan historian, with occasional bursts oftricksterish mischief. Their training usually begins with vivid dreams inchildhood, sometimes accompanied by physical suffering and emotional distress.Parents may despair at the idea of their child abandoning normal life for theshadowy, dangerous profession of diviner, but the calling cannot be denied.Training is generally provided by an older diviner who instructs the initiate inthe potentials of dream knowledge. In rare cases, dreaming itself can besufficient to launch a diviner’s career, as in the following case of a Temne manwho practiced river-pebble divination (an-bere): “I had no training: I got theknowledge from God. While I slept, I dreamed that a spirit tied me up and saidwe should do this work together. When I woke up the next morning, I could do it,and gave an egg to the spirit.”6 [notes.html#ch08fn6]Among the Zulu, the calling to divination comes in a dream or a vision, moreoften to women than men.7 [notes.html#ch08fn7] Their practices center on helpinglocal people diagnose the cause of strange events and misfortunes, ranging fromunusual pregnancies and crop failures to marital problems and spirit possession.The Zulu, like many African cultural traditions, also incorporate dreaming intoother ritual practices besides those associated with divination. A significantdream marks the beginning of the rite of passage for Zulu males known as thethomba ceremony.8 [notes.html#ch08fn8] Each boy is taught to be ready for thenight when he first experiences a sexually climactic dream, one producing anocturnal emission. When such a physically exciting carryover experience fromdreaming to waking does occur, the boy is instructed to get up before dawn, openthe village cattle pens, and lead the animals to a hiding place, after which heshould ritually bathe at a stream and wait for morning. Meanwhile, the villagerswill awaken, notice the missing cattle, and realize what has happened. They willimmediately begin making preparations for the thomba ceremony, which involvesstrict seclusion from women, secret teachings, dancing and feasting, and a greatdeal of ritual fighting with sticks. At the end of these ceremonies a fullyinitiated man emerges, sexually potent and ready to seek (or steal) a bride.In some African traditions, dreaming serves as a guide for ritual practice ingeneral. For example, the elders of Yansi clans seek ancestor dreams beforemaking any important decision relating to the community’s welfare (e.g., whetherto leave on a journey or a hunting expedition, how to resolve a propertydispute, when to schedule a religious ceremony, etc.).9 [notes.html#ch08fn9] Theelders will gather and sleep at night in the open air, awakening in the morningto share and interpret one another’s dreams, seeking information and insightregarding the decision at hand. Nor is the dreaming-ritual connection only foundamong political leaders and the social elite. Many ordinary African peopleconsult diviners for help with recurrent nightmares and frightening sleepexperiences.While virtually everyone recognizes the spiritual potential of dreaming, noAfrican tradition is ignorant of the darker, more malevolent forces also atwork, and diviners are the community experts in protecting people from thosenightmare powers. Here is an account from a prominent diviner among theIngessana of East-Central Africa, giving an example of what happens when peopleare attacked in their dreams by the loathsomely frightening creatures known asnengk (singular nenget):At night a nenget will come to you and show you a cow, and before it goes awayit will throw sorghum seed around the homestead. Unless you sacrifice a cow, thenenget, by the seed it has planted in the homestead, will take the lives of yourlivestock or even your wife and children and yourself. So you will send for adoctor-diviner and tell him of the dream. That it is a nenget will be confirmedby the diviner casting three pieces of tobacco and interpreting how they fall.So the diviner will go around the homestead digging out with his special staffthe seed which he is able to see. Sometimes he will also have to pull seeds outof the body of some afflicted person in the homestead. A cow is sacrificed, andthen the elders deliver orations addressed to the nengk asking them to departnow that they have been given what they demanded.10 [notes.html#ch08fn10]For the Ingessana, as for many African communities, life involves a constantprocess of negotiation with spiritual powers that manifest themselves in manytypes of experience, most reliably in dreaming. The dangers of failing toappease the spirits are believed to be very real, and the diviner takesnightmares like these with the utmost seriousness. The ritual process justdescribed has the effect of bringing the dream into the waking world as fully aspossible, first by giving it voice and sharing it with others, then hunting forthe seeds, sacrificing the cow, and praying respectfully to the nengk, alldemonstrating the individual’s faith and humility before the spirits. Thediviner places him- or herself between the spirits and the suffering individual,mediating their interests and cultivating a pragmatic accommodation of each tothe other. With a foot in each reality the diviner bridges the ancestral pastand the living present, seeking a new path to a healthier and more prosperousfuture.CONVERSIONThe two largest and most powerful religions in the world, Christianity andIslam, have long and troubled histories of missionary activity in Africa.Christian evangelism spread to Egypt within the first few decades after Jesus’scrucifixion, and Muhammad’s followers advanced the Muslim faith all the wayacross North Africa to Morocco in less than a hundred years after his death. Ineach case it is impossible to separate the religious conversions from themilitary conquests—Christianity and Islam alike have established themselves inAfrica at the point of a sword. Today, the continent’s population is aboutevenly split between the two traditions (approximately 400 million each), asIslam remains the predominant religion in North Africa while Christianity reignsin sub-Saharan Africa. (It must be added that many Africans cannot beexclusively categorized as either Christian or Muslim.) Evaluating the fullhistorical impact of these two monotheistic traditions on the indigenousspiritualities of Africa is a task far beyond the scope of this chapter. We canconsider, however, the role of dreaming as a common religious language betweenAfricans and the Christian and Muslim missionaries. Dreams provided themissionaries a means of explaining the tenets of their faith and giving peoplean experiential source of divine revelation leading to conversion. Dreams alsoprovided indigenous Africans with a vital resource for resisting externalmissionary coercion and affirming their own independent visionary powers.Having already discussed the increasingly distrustful view of dreaming in thehistory of Christian theology, we can appreciate the difficulty somemissionaries found in talking to African people about the subject.11[notes.html#ch08fn11] This theme also recurs in the next two chapters:dream-doubting Christians meet dream-obsessed natives. Firsthand reports frommissionaries often include a mention of the primitive people’s extravagant dreambeliefs and inexplicable acceptance of the reality of sleeping experience. Somemissionaries tried to dismiss dreams entirely as a source of spiritual guidance.In the words of a twentieth-century Christian from England working in CentralAfrica, a good response to a dream-obsessed native “is to pooh-pooh his fearsand tell him that his dreams are the result of an overwrought imagination, or alittle undigested gravy.” But this kind of attitude became increasinglydifficult once the African people began reading the Bible for themselves andlearning about the stories of divine dream revelations in the books of Genesis,Daniel, Matthew, and Acts. For this reason, other missionaries took a moreaccommodating tone and employed the deeply rooted African interest in dreamingas a means of explaining the superiority of Christian religious understanding.Dream interpretation thus became an active arena of religious persuasion,resistance, and conversion. A nineteenth-century English Christian missionary inNorth Africa recorded the following dreams:Today I went back, forgetting what had happened, to a house where the woman hadturned me out last week, almost before I had set foot in it, saying she wouldhear nothing about Jesus. Strangely, I had forgotten it, as we say, when I wentin. Her first words were: ‘I sent you away last week, I was very wrong. Jesuscame to me that night and frightened me. I dared not open my eyes to look atHim. He said: “Why did you not listen? You must listen.” His hand was on me. Itwould have suffocated me if I had not feared and said: “I have had enough, Iwill listen now.” And listen she did.[An African woman told the same missionary:] “I have had a dream, it was thenight after you were here. I saw two kanouns [fire pots]. In one was a verylittle fire, nearly going out; in the other was a bright fire that wasincreasing. Someone was standing by and he said: “Do you know what these twofires mean?” I said: “No.” He went on: “The little fire that is nearly out isthe religion of the Arabs, [and] the bright fire is what your friend has toldyou about Jesus. There is certainty about that. You have to leave the old fireand come to the new.” “I believed before,” she said, “I believed but now I know.I am one of you now and the sister of the others in the world.”12[notes.html#ch08fn12]As the latter report suggests, the competition between Christians and Muslimsfor African converts could be fierce, and dreaming could serve either missionarycause by providing a direct experiential validation of the “true” faith. In somecases, the missionaries found they had an almost magical power to elicit dreamconversions by nothing more than their presence. Such is the story of an earlytwentieth-century Christian evangelist working among the Bantu of South Africa:Up among the mountains, behind one of my remoter stations, is a steep valley;and up this valley, at the end of everything, is a village. I had never beenthere, and am still not aware that anyone from there had ever been to see me.Late one afternoon, then, a man came from this village to call me to a “sick”woman of whom, as we went, he related these facts. A month previously thewoman’s heathen husband had died. A week later she awoke one night screaming,and had said that as she lay asleep she had felt a hand on her shoulder.Awakening—such was her language, but of course she spoke of her dream—she sawher dead husband, in his ordinary clothes and so “real” that she forgot for themoment that he was dead. She gave a cry of joy, and demanded where he had beento return to the hut so late. On that he had said: “Send at once for the priestat—and be washed from your sins.” “But why do you come now to tell me that?” sheasked. “Lest you die as I have done, unwashed,” he replied awfully. And at thatshe remembered his death, was convulsed with terror, and found herself awake.Her folk had temporized with her, and had not sent for me, none of them beingChristian there; but ten days or so later she had dreamed again. This time herhusband was angry, had said nothing, had not indeed needed to say anything, forshe had known instinctively his anger and the reason for it. From that time shehad eaten next to nothing, and had been in a kind of fit all day long,reiterating that I must be sent for. But the night before she had dreamed that awhite priest came in, in a white vestment, and, laying hands upon her, hadhealed her.13 [notes.html#ch08fn13]When the priest arrived he did as the woman had dreamed, putting his hands uponher and praying for her well-being. She recovered from her illness and went onto become a baptized Christian who converted many other people from her village.So the priest had to do practically nothing—all his work was done by the woman’sdreams. Quite a useful missionary tool! Her first dream, a classic visitationcomplete with hyper-realism and vivid sensation of touch, involved a frighteningadmonition from her dead husband to convert to Christianity. As someone who hadjust passed from this world to the next, he would be a credible witness to theconditions of the afterlife, making his message all the more compelling andtrustworthy. The woman’s kinfolk, trying to maintain village traditions againstChristian encroachment, were reluctant to accept her dream at face value. Butthe wordless urgency of the second dream gave her such inner certainty that sheessentially withdrew in body, mind, and soul from the village in order to waitfor the priest’s arrival.From a Christian missionary viewpoint, this seems like a perfect illustration ofthe Holy Spirit as a guiding and liberating force in people’s dreams. It may beso. A more socio-psychologically oriented perspective would also want toacknowledge the strategic value of such conversion dreams in relation to theindividual’s adaptation to a sudden life crisis. A widow in any society faces agrim future, and in such circumstances the fresh promise of a new faith becomesall the more appealing. Considered purely as a matter of survival, it was areasonable decision for the Bantu woman to follow her dreams and become aChristian. Her chances for physical protection and support were very likelyimproved as a result (many of the earliest Roman converts to Christianity werewidows, the poor, and the sick). Note, too, the priest’s mention of all the newconverts she then persuaded to join her. This undoubtedly enhanced the woman’sprospects even more, as she now rose in social status to an important newposition, that of intermediary between her village and the spiritual powersrepresented by the priest. A new kind of African diviner had been born, one whoaccepted Christianity in order to use it, benefit from it, and then transformit. Where the missionaries saw multitudes of new converts, many Africansthemselves saw a new regime of religious and political authority that could, bymeans of the ancient practices of dreaming, be adapted to their own needs andcreative desires.What has happened to Christianity in Africa has also happened to Islam.14[notes.html#ch08fn14] At the level of theological doctrine, orthodox Muslimteachings directly contradicted the strong and widespread African belief in theimportance of interacting in dreams with a multitude of deceased ancestors whokept the people rooted in traditional religious wisdom. The purest and strictestMuslim faith insists that the only true God is Allah, and no other deities orsupernatural beings should be worshiped. In Islam, as in Christianity, themonotheistic imperative could be taken as sufficient cause to doubt any value indreaming, and thus to forbid indigenous peoples from pursuing and exploringtheir dreams. The practical realities of African-Muslim relations, however,generated several compromise strategies that allowed people to continue dreamingin the old communal ways, but under the watchful rule of the new Islamicauthorities. One of these strategies involved accepting dream visitations fromthe dead so long as the message of the deceased ancestor compelled theindividual to convert to Islam. Much like the Bantu woman just mentioned whosedead husband commanded that she convert to Christianity, many African peopleadopted Islam because they were inspired by a visitation dream in which atrusted ancestor sanctioned the change in religious worldview. The drawback tothis accommodation (from a monotheistic point of view) was that it kept alivethe pre-Muslim polytheistic belief in the spiritual potency of dreaming, abelief that fueled the ongoing practice of traditional healing, divination, andother forms of “witchcraft ” in African communities long after they hadsupposedly converted to Islam.15 [notes.html#ch08fn15]By far the most effective strategy for harmonizing Muslim teachings withtraditional African approaches concerned the practice of istikhara.16[notes.html#ch08fn16] Many African cultures had a long history of performingtheir own dream incubation rituals, making it much easier for the Islamicversion of istikhara to be understood and adapted to the African context. Thisshared practice could then become a useful missionary tool for spreading furtherinformation about Islam. Muslim clerics, especially members of the mysticallyinclined Sufi orders, took on the professional role of public dream guides andinterpreters, effectively displacing traditional diviners (and providingthemselves with a lucrative source of income). Istikhara in Africa could beperformed for any of the usual reasons, for example, to diagnose a mysteriousillness, seek divine guidance in choosing a marriage partner, gain insight on aparticular point of spiritual wisdom, and so on. If the ritual was performedaccording to basic Muslim requirements (purifying one’s body, reciting Qur’anicverses, sleeping on the right side with the right hand under one’s ear), and ifthe resultant dream was immediately interpreted by a Muslim cleric, Istikharaprovided an acceptable arena in which Africans could continue their time-honoredcommunion with dreaming.At times, the dreaming imagination seemed to be the only power remaining for asubjugated African people, as illustrated by a case from mid-twentieth-centuryEgypt.17 [notes.html#ch08fn17] The Nubian civilization thrived for thousands ofyears at the upper reaches of the Nile River, periodically contending for powerwith the Pharaohs of Egypt down river to the north. In modern times, the Nubianshave been largely absorbed into urban Muslim cultures in Egypt and Sudan, and inthe 1960s the construction of the High Dam at Aswan resulted in the completesubmersion and loss of all their remaining ancestral lands. The Nubian peoplewere relocated to other towns and cities, where they adopted Sufi Islam with apeculiar dream twist. To dream of a Sufi saint was, according to the Islamicauthorities, a legitimate religious experience. But the Nubians began reportingsaint dreams with messages that led to a very specific goal—the creation of newspiritual homes for their exiled religious community. The ancestral visitationdreams of these displaced Nubians often included a specific request from thesaint to build a shrine at a particular location where the people could properlyworship God. In just a few years, hundreds of shrines were created in this way.These dream sanctuaries provided a safe and comfortable setting where thedevotional ritual of dhikr (chanting, singing, and praying to God with totalconcentration and purity of intent) could be practiced by the Nubian Muslimconverts. The dreams of the Nubians gave them the personal motivation andtheological justification to build their own places of worship, infused withtheir own felt meanings and their own sense of religious presence. Completelycut off from their primal homelands and cast adrift in the modern world, theNubians faced the imminent prospect of their extinction as a community. In thatsituation of ultimate collective peril they used their dreams as a resource tohelp reestablish their collective cultural roots both physically andspiritually.Once again, such cases raise the intriguing question of who exactly isconverting whom. Have the Nubians become Muslim, or has Islam (in this specificlived context) become Nubian? Influences are clearly moving in both directions,with dreams providing a crucial bridging experience. According to the evidencewe have been discussing, the term “conversion” does not mean a simple act ofswitching from one religion to another. Rather, the term should denote amutually transformative process of spiritual identity change in which bothreligious traditions develop in new directions. In the present case, thequestion is more historically complex because, as we saw in chapter 7[ch07.html#ch07], Islam emerged within the broader context of ancient FertileCrescent religious traditions, many of which (like the Nubians) venerated thespiritual power of dreaming. The Muslim practice of istikhara can therefore beseen as a product of Islam’s initial accommodations to earlier religious dreampractices that the region’s people felt were fundamentally important and worthpreserving in the new tradition. This means that the Nubians, by converting tothe Muslim faith, were in a sense drawing Islam back to its own spiritual roots.AFRICAN INDEPENDENT CHURCHESThe dire personal and communal circumstances that typically spark religiousconversions tell us something important about human nature. When faced withsituations of terror, suffering, and death, the human brain-mind system becomescapable of extraordinary creative efforts to make sense of and act effectivelyin response to those life-threatening conditions. This also tells us somethingimportant about dreaming, namely, that we can confidently, if sadly, predictthat dreams will become an increasingly important source of personal inspirationand cultural meaning-making in direct proportion to the severity of a crisissituation. In most parts of Africa during the twentieth century the people havestruggled through hellish miseries of war, drought, famine, plague, andpolitical oppression. Knowing what we know about dreams, we would expect thatthe cultural and religious responses of indigenous Africans to these horrorswould include a strong reliance on dreaming, and that turns out to be thecase.18 [notes.html#ch08fn18] Many of the new religious movements known by thegeneral term “African Independent Churches” proclaimed their spiritual autonomyfrom both Christianity and ancient African traditions. They offered radicallynew messages for radically different times, and dreaming was a primary mediumfor their creative religious responses to the dangers pressing in on allsides.19 [notes.html#ch08fn19]Dreaming played at least two important roles for the African IndependentChurches. First, it provided the initial inspiration for individuals who becamecharismatic leaders of these new spiritual groups. As usual, we can never besure if the particular dreams now available for study were accurately reported,and there is always the likelihood that some reports were embellished or made upto enhance a leader’s authority. But we can also be sure, based on strongevidence from scientific dream research, that the African people living throughthese terrifying situations were indeed dreaming about their plight and seekingcreative visions to help them survive. A few of these people had dreams in whichthey envisioned a better future not just for themselves but for their wholecommunity. Thus an individual dream could inspire new hope and vitality foreveryone who was suffering through a collective crisis. Examples include therise of the Kimbangu Church of Congo, born in the militant dreams of SimonKimbangu (1889–1951), who ended up dying in a colonial prison; the Church ofNazareth Baptists among the Zulu in southern Africa, whose founder Isaiah Shembe(1867–1935) was guided by his early-life dreams to become a healer; and theAladura movement among the Yoruba in western Africa, in which the faith-healingministry of founder Joseph Sadare directly relied upon the divine messages ofhis dreams and visions.20 [notes.html#ch08fn20]Sadare’s movement began during the global influenza pandemic in 1918–19, whenmillions upon millions of Africans died, and he used dreams to guide his effortsat prayer-based healing (Aladura means “the ones who pray”). Rejecting bothWestern medicine and traditional African remedies as obviously ineffective instopping the plague, Sadare and his followers had to look elsewhere for healingpower. He and his followers engaged in extensive group discussions about theirdreams and visions, which brings us to the second important role of dreaming inthe African Independent Churches. The public sharing of dreams became a standardfeature of group worship services, and in some churches dream sharing was thecentral ritual activity. For example, members of the Zulu Zionist churches ofsouthern Africa frequently shared dreams of ancestral visitations, propheticrevelations from the Holy Spirit, and occasionally a demonic temptation in anightmare.21 [notes.html#ch08fn21] Sharing dreams like this served as a vitalsource of collective spiritual bonding in these groups, enabling each individualto weave his or her creative visions into a newly emerging whole.In all African Independent Churches the telling of dreams inevitably becameentangled with struggles over social power and religious authority, so theprocess was hardly a model of utopian harmony. Indeed, one of the mostdream-centered groups, the True Church of God among the Igbo people of Nigeria,was exceptionally restrictive and demanding with its members, comparable in manyways to a Christian fundamentalist church in the contemporary United States.22[notes.html#ch08fn22] Financial donations and frequent attendance at worshipwere absolutely required; God was repeatedly portrayed by the church leaders asa stern, all-powerful father figure; the Bible was interpreted literally as theonly authoritative guide to religious life. From a skeptical perspective, theTrue Church of God looks like a perfect example of an authoritarian,closed-minded sect. But if we consider the African missionary context in whichit emerged, this new religious movement is better understood as an expression ofcreative spiritual adaptation. The Igbo who joined the church were intentionallyseparating themselves from both their ancestral heritage and the authority ofthe white European missionaries. They were religious pioneers who pledgedthemselves to a new and, they hoped, better path, taking the missionaries’ mostprized source of power—the Bible—and using it to serve their own local needs andpurposes. And far from being rigid-thinking automatons, the members of the TrueChurch made open-ended dream sharing a regular feature of their worshipservices, a practice allowing everyone in the group (children included) to voicetheir hopes and anxieties, to wonder about the mysterious workings of thedivine, and to develop practical strategies for dealing with waking-worldproblems. Dreams were said to be communications from the Holy Spirit, a beliefthat added extra incentive for people to remember their sleep experiences andtalk about them with others. Many of the Igbo initially joined the churchbecause of dreams that were interpreted as calls to conversion. These dreamsthen became badges of spiritual status in the group, establishing theauthenticity of a person’s relationship with God. Church leaders listened to asmany dreams as possible to glean information of relevance to the congregation asa whole (and, we may surmise, to monitor nascent heresies and possibledeviations from church authority).The central importance of dreaming for the True Church of God does not mean weshould regard the movement as either a “good” or a “bad” religion. Suchevaluations are not the concern of this book, and, in any case, are of dubiousvalue. The focus here is on the dynamic interaction of dreaming and religiouslife, particularly in times of conflict and change. The people of the TrueChurch relied so heavily on their dreams because they were living in a place andtime in which they felt an especially urgent need for consolation, hope, andvision. That doesn’t make them good or bad, noble or savage, enlightened orignorant. It just makes them human.SUMMARYThe history of religions in Africa covers so much territory, so many differentpeoples, and such a vast stretch of time that any general claims about theirdream beliefs and practices must be made with special caution. Based on theevidence in this chapter, it seems fair to say that most African religioustraditions have distinguished between dreams originating from human causes(e.g., dreams of a waking preoccupation or physical illness) and divine sources(e.g., an ancestral visitation or a vision from God). At least some Africanreligions have made dreaming a central feature of their worship, indicating astrong desire to enhance the impact of divine dreams in people’s waking lives.Along with the now familiar functions of prophecy, healing, and creativeinspiration, African religions have shown a special desire to seek the powers ofdreaming during times of personal and collective crisis. In some cases, thedream-guided outcome is a conversion to a new faith (Christianity or Islam); inother cases, the dreams prompt a revitalization of traditional religiousteachings; and in still other cases, the outgrowth of dreaming is a newsynthesis of the old and the new. Regarding interpretation, we know very littleabout African teachings before the arrival of Christian and Muslim missionaries.The most avid dreamers in Africa today appear to be the members of theIndependent African Churches, whose dream interpretation practices involve anelaborate process of public sharing, group discussion, and biblical association."},{"pageContent":"9RELIGIONS OF OCEANIAMuch of the discussion so far has focused on what people see in dreams. Visionis the strongest mode of sense perception in a large majority of the religiouslysignificant dreams that we have considered. Many of the world’s cultures haveenshrined this perceptual primacy in their definitions of dreaming as a kind ofinner seeing. Dreams with strong auditory sensations are less often reported;the most impactful types are those in which a god, spirit, or ancestor deliversa clearly spoken message. Taste and smell are rarely mentioned in dream reports,either historically or in contemporary research. Whatever functions dreams mayserve, they apparently do not require the activation of these two sensorymodalities. This is a suggestive finding, because taste and smell differ fromvision and hearing in the spatial range of their effectiveness. Taste depends ona stimulus directly to the tongue, and smell operates best in an atmosphericzone close to the body, whereas both sight and sound provide detailedinformation about stimuli located far away from the individual. By means ofvision and hearing, humans have developed a dramatically expanded sphere ofself-awareness and a greater consciousness of their location in the physicalworld. Vision and hearing are the best senses for long-distance threat detectionand beyond-the-horizon journeying and exploration. These are the senses we bringwith us when we dream.What of the fifth mode of sense perception, touch? If by touch we mean bodysensations generally, then it ranks much closer to sight and sound than tasteand smell in its importance to dreaming. Besides intensely realistic experiencesof direct physical contact with other people (aggressively in a fight, sexuallyin a romantic tryst), many dreams involve vivid somatic actions such as walking,driving, swimming, running, dancing, playing a sport, and even flying, alongwith more negative experiences like crying, falling, being paralyzed, losingteeth, being hit, stabbed, or shot. A basic sense of embodiment, personalpresence, and physical movement seems to be a standard part of human dreaming,though of course we also find instances of disembodied dreaming experiencereported in many traditions. Actually, all dreams are disembodied insofar as ourbodies remain in bed while we dream of moving in other places. Here is anotherparadox at the heart of dreaming: it is rooted in, and yet ranges far beyond,the physical location of the sleeping body.A couple of weeks before writing this particular section of the book, I attendedan academic conference in Washington, D.C. My hotel was just a block from theMall, and each evening after finishing with the conference I strolled around thecenter of the Capitol, admiring the wartime memorials, laying hands on theWashington Monument, and glaring at the White House. I went to bed at night withmy head full of images, feelings, and ideas from lively conversations at theconference and from my ambivalent musings on the sacred grounds of the Union.But my dreams made no explicit reference to any of that; instead, theycontinuously brought me back to my home, three thousand miles away. Theircontent revolved around emotionally laden images of being with my family,passing through neighborhood streets, shopping at the market, driving the familycar, with nothing directly relating either to the conference or the governmentalsurroundings. Though my waking self was in Washington, my dreaming self wastransported back to the familiar haunts of home. No expert interpretation wasneeded to explain this—I missed my family and worried about their well-being. Mydreams were continuous not with my physical location but with my emotionalconcerns, specifically a longing for home. This is one small illustration of howdreams can be both highly realistic and unrealistic at the same time. Readersmay want to consider how often their own dreams bring them back to places(houses, neighborhoods, schools, dorms, camps) that are distant from theircurrent physical locations but close to the deepest realities of theirpresent-day emotional lives.Indeed, the evidence gathered in this book supports the idea of a dynamicrelationship between waking and dreaming movement. How people move in the wakingworld can impact their dreams, and how they move in dreaming can influence theiractions while awake. In the religions of Oceania, these mind-body processes ofdreaming and waking movement have been developed into mutually supportivecultural systems with origins stretching far into the ancestral past. Likehumans everywhere, the people of these Pacific Island communities have dreamedof fantastic visions and clear verbal messages. But more than most, the peoplesof Oceania have journeyed in their dreams, moving in spirit as energetically asthey moved physically during the original era of human settlement in their partof the world.1 [notes.html#ch09fn1]AGE OF EXPLORATIONAround the same time that bands of Homo sapiens in southern Europe were“creatively exploding” in their beautifully decorated, ritually consecratedcaves, other groups were taking advantage of relatively low sea levels to travelacross land bridges to what we now call Australia (from Latin, “to the south”).What they found was a temperate, ecologically abundant country that had neverknown the presence of humans. Short sailing trips from Australia and variousparts of southern Asia led to the discovery of other biologically plentifulislands where humans could settle in prosperity and comfort. These voyages inquest of new islands became increasingly skillful and daring, covering hundredsand then thousands of miles of open ocean. Naturally no records remain of themany explorers who perished in the uncharted seas. But those who survived theirjourneys and succeeded in finding land were rewarded with the opportunity towield unrivaled power in bountiful new environments. In time, every habitableisland in the western Pacific was settled, generating rapid bursts of culturalcreativity as the people of each new community took control of the virgin landsand prepared themselves for new expeditions.The nineteenth-century French term “Oceania,” as imperfect as any otherexpression used in this book, is a collective noun denoting the kindred culturesof Australia, New Guinea, the Malay Archipelago, New Zealand, and the hundredsof western Pacific islands stretching as far north as Hawaii and as far east asEaster Island. What binds these widely dispersed cultures and peoples togetheris a historically unfolding web of genetics, language, social structure, andceremonial customs. Information about their earliest religious beliefs andpractices exists only in the form of scattered rock paintings, artifacts, andfragments of myth and legend. Similar to the situation in Africa, the mostdetailed records of Oceanic cultures come from the very people (Europeancolonizers) who were actively working to replace the indigenous spiritualtraditions with a new regime of Christian control over thought and deed. Onceagain, our historical vision is drastically limited by the elusiveness ofreliable evidence.Without ignoring all the specialized research on the incredible diversity ofcultural groups in this region (New Guinea alone is home to roughly one thousanddifferent languages),2 [notes.html#ch09fn2] this chapter takes a broadercomparative approach, with the aim of outlining the shared dream teachings ofOceania. Wherever these adventurous seafaring folk traveled, they brought withthem traditions of dreaming that helped them remain connected to their ancestrallands while inspiring them to embark on new journeys into the unknown.TJUKURRPA, OR DREAMTIMEThe arrival of humans in Australia was, from the perspective of the othercreatures living there, a cataclysmic event. The same climate changes thatallowed humans to reach Australia probably put additional stress on some of thenative species, but even taking that into account it is clear that humanactivities greatly contributed to the mass extinctions that swept over the landsoon after they appeared. The combination of improved weaponry and strategic useof brush-clearing fires enabled the first settlers to hunt and kill at will,essentially remaking the face of the continent. For the next forty thousandyears the descendents of these Neolithic pioneers prospered in small bands ofnomadic wanderers. Agriculture never developed in any large-scale form, andtheir social groupings remained fairly small, though, as mentioned, theirlinguistic and cultural dynamism was impressive. Their religious beliefs andpractices revolved around an ancient myth that explained the creation of theworld and the proper place of humans within it. This myth was the ultimatesource of meaning and spiritual guidance in aboriginal life, and its rootsreached as far into the past as anyone could remember. It was a myth ofprimordial, autochthonous dreaming.The local terms used for this myth, Tjukurrpa, Alchera, and Alcheringa, havebeen translated by anthropologists as “The Dreaming” or “Dream-time.”3[notes.html#ch09fn3] This is only partly accurate. “Ancestral Order” is anotherpossible translation, though even that phrase obscures the restless stirring ofcreative potency that is part of it, too. Tjukurrpa is a realm outside ordinaryphysical time and space, yet vibrantly present in every feature of theworld—land and sea, plants and animals, sun and stars. It is the beginning ofall that is, the creative labor of the ancestors striding the land andsingingits nature into being. The ancestors still live in Tjukurrpa, and humanshave the ability to connect with them through their personal dreaming. Tjukurrpais not synonymous with individual dreams experienced during sleep (calledkapukurri), but the Australian aborigines recognized a strong and vitalrelationship between the two. Personal dreaming was a means of entering intoTjukurrpa, allowing each person his or her own access to the powers of theancestors. The aborigines affirmed the democratic accessibility of dreaming asmuch as any culture in history, and they made a point of teaching their childrenabout dreaming from early in life so they would be prepared for theopportunities and dangers that arose in their sleep experiences. In fact, theaborigines believed each child was born into this world through a dreamexperienced by the mother or other close relative (whether or not theyremembered having the dream). In this dream the spirit-child began the processof moving from the Tjukurrpa into human form. Death for the aborigines was amovement in the other direction, from physical embodiment back into Tjukurrpa.4[notes.html#ch09fn4]We do not know how far back in history the aboriginal teachings about Tjukurrpacan be traced. Prior to contact with Western missionaries and colonizers, wehave no clear view of the changes and continuities in Australian aboriginalcultures. Maybe the mythic concept of Tjukurrpa is a recent development with noconnection to past cultural teachings. Maybe it is a foreign idea imported byvisitors to Australia long after the era of original settlement. But maybe it iswhat the aborigines say it is, namely, a true history of the creation of theirland. Any argument here is speculative; I believe, however, that the Tjukurrpamyth, more likely than not, represents a forty-thousand-year-old spiritualinsight about the creative powers of dreaming. The first human settlers inAustralia really did create the land their descendents inherited from them,discovering it after long and perilous travels and violently transforming itsbiosystem according to their needs and desires. This isn’t just superstitiousfancy, it is an accurate representation of what actually happened. Theunprecedented creative feats of those heroic people would naturally echo inlater aboriginal dreams, reinforced by rituals, stories, and “walk-abouts” alongthe ancestral song lines criss-crossing the continent. The Dreaming was anever-ending song of the birth of aboriginal life in a mythic realm woven ofhistory, geography, and psychophysiological experience, where living people canroam freely in the company of their extended spiritual family.SOUL JOURNEYSImplicit in this myth is a fairly straightforward explanation of what happens ina dream. When a person goes to sleep, his or her dream-spirit (partunjarri) isreleased from the physical body and is able to fly in the realm of the Dreaming.We have encountered different versions of this folk theory many times before,and more instances are still to come. The notion of dreams as the experiences ofthe liberated soul is so widespread in cross-cultural history that it should beconsidered the commonsensical human view, the cognitive default position forHomo sapiens reasoning about dreams. It is certainly the easiest way to explainthe obvious phenomenon that everyone knows from personal experience, namely, thedisjunction between an unconscious, physically motionless sleeping body and aconscious, active, and mobile dream-self. (Hence the corollary folk warning,found in Australia and elsewhere, that one should never awaken a sleeping persontoo suddenly, lest the dream-self not have enough time to return to the body.)The key religious consequence of this idea is that it validates the specialontological status of dreaming, establishing it as a type of reality proper tothe qualities of the liberated spirit or soul. Dreaming provides prima facieevidence for the authenticity of religious teachings, and anyone who doubts thatevidence can test its truthfulness in their own dream experiences.The aboriginal Australians took the reality of dreaming so seriously that theydeveloped methods of collective action in dreams, in which whole groups wouldjoin together to journey in the Dreaming. These journeys were led by divinationand healing experts known as maparn. The maparn led the participants inpre-sleep ritual preparations, after which everyone joined in a shared dream inwhich the maparn piloted them in a flying convoy aboard a sacred object orspiritually charged creature like a snake. Particularly in recent times, whenthe aborigines have been compelled by modernization to live far from their hometerritories, dream-spirit journeys have taken on special significance as a meansof remaining connected to ancestral lands. To Western ears the experience ofshared dreaming may sound silly, but in aboriginal practice it was oftenassociated with feelings of danger and vulnerability. The maparn-guided dreamconvoys provided people with a safety-in-numbers kind of protection against themalevolent forces and beings that their dream-spirits were likely to encounterin their travels. The release of the soul from the sleeping body was adouble-edged sword, making it equally possible to meet helpful ancestors or fallprey to hostile spirits. As a result, the aboriginal Australians did notundertake dream journeys for light entertainment or whimsical diversion. Thesewere deadly serious religious practices aimed at rejuvenating the fundamentallife energy of the community. Despite repeated criticism from disapprovingChristian missionaries, many aborigines have continued to practice thedream-journeying tradition, seeking in personal dreaming a true connection totheir ancestral lands in Tjukurrpa.Many other cultural groups in Oceania also shared this notion of dreaming as asoul journey, and at this point we can widen our discussion to include thehundreds of different human communities living in New Guinea. The world’ssecond-largest island lying just to the north of Australia, New Guinea was untilfive thousand years ago connected to the Australian continent by a land bridge.People had been living, fighting, and developing the land there for tens ofthousands of years before that, hence the close relationship between theindigenous cultures of New Guinea and Australia (though more recent migrationsof human populations from Asia have also had a strong cultural impact). Mostinteresting, from our perspective, is the strong continuity of dream traditionsacross these different cultures. Through all the long ages of changing climatesand fluctuating sea levels, while the people spread far and settled in separateregions where they developed distinctive linguistic identities, virtually everyculture continued to rely on dreaming as a valuable source of spiritual insightand community guidance.Among the Mekeo people, who live in small villages carved out of the bush in ahumid river valley in central New Guinea, a dream (nipi) takes place when aperson’s body sleeps and his or her dream-self (lalauga) leaves to see and dovarious things.5 [notes.html#ch09fn5] The lalauga is real but has no materialsubstance, and people may perceive it in waking life as an apparition or ghost.The separation of lalauga and the body creates an existentially threateningcondition in which a person can easily fall sick, become injured, even die.Nevertheless, dreaming experiences are highly prized as means of gainingspiritual power, and so the risks are considered worth taking. The Mekeorecognize that some dreams are relatively trivial reflections of daily life,with little or no significance, whereas other dreams offer opportunities forsoul travel to otherworldly realms, including the land of the dead, magicalEuropean cities, and the deep aquatic abodes of faifai water spirits. The Mekeoregard most of their dreams as palopole, metaphorical riddles whose meaningsmust be searched for and discovered by the waking mind. Interpretation dependson both the personal situation of the dreamer and the social context in which heor she experienced the dream. Many Mekeo dreams are interpreted as omens ofwaking-life danger, particularly the possible death of a relative or friend.This is not an unreasonable concern for people living in a region with constantthreats from disease, storms, earthquakes, volcanoes, and attacks from warringneighbors. Dreams of sexual encounters are widely experienced but carefullyguarded and kept secret. The Mekeo belief in the reality of the lalauga’stravels during sleep implies that an erotic dream with another person should betaken as an urgent warning, especially for women who may realize from thesedreams that they are the targets of the love rituals of unknown men. Dreaming ofsex with a water spirit or a dead person is never good and foreshadows illnessand destruction. Whether the content of their dreams is good or bad, the Mekeocherish the capacity of the lalauga to discover hidden knowledge and perceivehidden truths. Religious rituals may enhance and focus this capacity, but itsbasic functioning is innate in all people.For the Mekeo and other New Guinea peoples, the metaphorical dimensions ofdreaming require looking past the literal imagery to recognize and appreciate adream’s most important meaning. A good example of this principle comes from theMae Enga, a rough community of warriors and farmers in New Guinea.6[notes.html#ch09fn6] One of the Mae Enga elders, a man named Anggauwane who waswell known for his moral integrity, mentioned to an anthropologist a dream inwhich he was walking along an unknown path through the tall cane grass when hesuddenly found himself face to face with an attractive woman from a rivalvillage. Anggauwane immediately proceeded to seduce the woman, and they began tomake love right there on the path. One of the woman’s male relatives appearedand threatened Anggauwane with an axe, but the clan leader merely glared at theman, who fled in fear. After reaching a satisfying conclusion, the dream ended.To the anthropologist’s surprise, when Anggauwane reported the dream he evincednone of the shame or embarrassment that would normally accompany a story thatviolated so many basic sexual taboos. Instead, he interpreted the dream in anonsexual way, as a metaphor for his current land dispute with the people of thewoman’s village. Anggauwane said it predicted that his clan would triumph aseasily as he had ravished the dream woman, and subsequent events in the wakingworld confirmed his prophecy. We might suspect that at another level the dreamrelates to unconscious sexual desires that Anggauwane did not want to recognizein himself, but we can hardly argue with his view that the dream metaphoricallyportrayed a favorable solution to an important problem in his current wakinglife.For the Melpa of the New Guinea western highlands it is the min or life-spiritthat travels beyond the body in dreaming.7 [notes.html#ch09fn7] The Melpadifferentiate between ur kumb, a positive “sleep dream” and mi kumb, a negative“taboo dream.” When they speak of dreaming they say ur kumb etepa koni, meaningto “make a sleep-likeness and see something.” Likewise, the Ngaing people of themountainous regions to the north use the visually oriented phrase amangenatemang, meaning “I have seen a dream,” and they regard dreams, illness,death, and divination practice as kindred experiences in which a person’sasabeiyang or spirit-being detaches from the body, allowing access to secretknowledge but inevitably rendering a person vulnerable to spirit attack.8[notes.html#ch09fn8] Many Oceanic cultures include dreaming in their initiationrituals, such as the Sambia of New Guinea’s central highlands whose shamanicspecialists (kwooluku) are originally called to their profession by vivid dreamsand nightmares in childhood.9 [notes.html#ch09fn9] These dreams indicate thatghosts and spirits are interested in the child, and further dreams lead to thediscovery of the special numilyu or ancestral familiar who will teach the shamanpowerful songs and guide him or her in future rituals, healing practices, andprophetic visions. Because of their special skills in the realm of dreaming, theSambian kwooluku serve as spiritual sentinels for the whole community, watchingcarefully for the first inklings of a surprise attack such as an epidemic or araid by hostile neighbors. The same is true for the manang shamans of the Ibanpeople from Borneo, east of New Guinea, whose dream-spirits (semengat) aretrained to find other people’s dream-spirits if they become lost in dreaming.10[notes.html#ch09fn10] The manang also have the responsibility of protecting Ibaninfants from the malevolent demons who threaten to steal these newly born,highly vulnerable dream-spirits.CHRISTIANIZATIONThe arrival of European Christian missionaries in Oceania prompted massivenumbers of people to adopt the new faith, though not always with the ideologicalpurity that might be expected of a complete religious conversion. Like theircounterparts in Africa, the missionaries in Oceania made effective use of theindigenous people’s interest in dreaming, reinterpreting their night visions inChristian terms while denying the validity of traditional spiritual beliefs.This process of dream-mediated religious change can be observed among theAsabano, a small group of semi-nomadic pig herders in central New Guinea whowere first contacted by colonial authorities in 1963 and who were converted to acharismatic form of Christianity in 1977 by a Baptist pastor named Diyos.11[notes.html#ch09fn11] Diyos organized a series of emotionally arousing revivalmeetings in which dreams (aluma), visions, and experiences of the Holy Spiritwere shared, interpreted, and religiously validated. The movement spread rapidlythroughout the Asabano community, and as part of their new faith the peopledestroyed their sacred houses and ancestral relics, pledging themselves to thesuperior spiritual power of Christianity. Dreams were frequently the catalystfor conversion, as in the case of an older Asabano woman named Wosono:God’s talk is true. I am a woman who likes to chew betelnut and smoke, but whenDiyos preached I started spirit work and I left all these old ways. Diyos andWani [his wife] talked, and my spirit also talked. The Holy Spirit told me,“Whatever custom your father taught you, it was a lie. You must follow God’sword.” He showed me in a dream—it was his thoughts, not mine. I was asleep and Isaw fire, and heard it said, “If you are stubborn you will go to the fire.” Isaw the ocean, and he said, “On the last day the ocean will come and covereveryone. If you believe you will turn into birds and fly to heaven.” I wasafraid and so I left my old customs. I saw this after the revival. Then a secondtime I dreamed the earth was changing, and I wanted to run away, but I turnedinto a butterfly and flew up. Then I was happy and clapped my hands. I thoughtit was real, but then I woke up. After this I just wanted to think about the newthings and the Bible all the time.Wosono’s remarkable reveries combine the frightening divine judgment of St.Jerome’s conversion nightmare with the spiritual metamorphosis and existentialfreedom of Lao Tzu’s butterfly dream. In a culture where people stronglybelieved in the reality of dreaming, Wosono’s experiences could not help butappear as convincing empirical proof of the truth of Christianity. At the sametime, dreams like this testified to the difficulty of giving up ancestraltraditions, generating a psychospiritual conflict between longing for the oldways and feeling attracted to the new. A young Asabano man who was attending amissionary school in the nearby town of Telefomin had the following dream:In the dream I was holding a magic piece of ginger to attract girls—you put itin your pocket. I was standing with a man in the Telefomin hospital. Then I sawa fairly old light-skinned woman [Semodu, a mythic Old Woman who created theAsabano’s land] come in. She came to fight with us two men. She asked us, “Doyou belong to me or to Jesus?” We answered that we belonged to Jesus, and shewas mad and took a swipe at me. I avoided her blow. We kept fighting, andeventually I told her, “I don’t belong to you, I belong to Jesus” repeatedly. Iwas holding up my thumb [a symbol of defiance]. Then I woke up.Immediately after awakening the young man went to his schoolteacher to relatethe dream, and the teacher interpreted it as a heavenly sign that the young manshould throw away the magic piece of ginger and pray more fervently to theChristian God. The young man accepted this interpretation and acted accordingly.From a Christian perspective, this was a missionary success story. From a modernskeptic’s perspective, it might look like a not very subtle form ofbrainwashing, a forced reattribution of religious meaning and social authority.But both readings fail to credit the young man with any agency or personal powerin his spiritual conflict. They both treat him as a passive recipient ofexternal influence, either beneficially in the Christian view or oppressively inthe skeptical view. An alternative approach, more in keeping with thedreamer-centered perspective of this book, views dreams like that of the youngAsabano man as expressions of a free creative energy latent within the dreamingimagination, an energy that enables the dreamer to innovate and adapteffectively to changing circumstances in the waking world. The young man, theolder Asabano woman, and the Asabano people as a whole were struggling toreorient themselves amid seismic shifts in everything from their familystructures and food production technologies to religious beliefs about creationand the afterlife. They had suffered a profound sense of cultural dislocation,but they had not yet lost all connection to their ancestral wisdom. They werestill dreaming. The content of their dreams may have changed, in keeping withthe sociopolitically accurate observation that the Christian deity was morepowerful than the Asabano spirits and ghosts. Now they dreamed more of Jesus andangels than the magical wobuno nature spirits of before. But what continued wastheir traditional reliance on dreaming for religious insight and guidance. Liketheir forebearers, the Asabano were still looking to their dreams for spiritualinsight in times of difficulty, uncertainty, and collective danger.The creative process develops in unique ways for each individual, and much moreresearch needs to be done on the interpersonal dynamics of meaning-making viadreams in “Christianized” cultures like that of the Asabano. But currentresearch is sufficient to establish the fact that the communities of Oceaniahave maintained a remarkable consistency in their traditional dreaming beliefsand practices. Even though their world has been turned upside down in the spaceof just a few years, the spiritual potency of dreaming remains a central featureof their lives. Another young Asabano man named Obai related the following to ananthropologist:I have strange dreams. At night I dream women come and take me away; or evilspirits come to kill me and I can fly, I don’t turn into a bird; I just fly. Ithink in dreams the spirit goes and the body stays. So the things we dreamreally happen. When I’m totally asleep, and I want to go to the bush, and stoneand tree spirits want to kill me, I just fly. In dreams it’s safe; I move aboutwell.12 [notes.html#ch09fn12]CARGO CULTSThe most decisive moment in Oceania’s encounter with modernity came during WorldWar II (1941–1945) when American and Japanese armies fought each other allacross the Pacific. The sudden appearance of mechanized warfare made a profoundimpact on the indigenous people’s imaginations. Staring in wonder at the noisilydroning airplanes flying high overhead, witnessing spectacular battles betweenunknown enemies using fantastically destructive weapons, meeting people withwhite skin who possessed an incredible abundance of food and material goods—theclosest analogy for the readers of this book would probably be an alien invasionfrom outer space. The abrupt confrontation with powers far beyond their ownprompted a collective crisis throughout Oceania, raising several urgentquestions. Where did these white people come from? Where did they get all theirwealth? How did their machines work? What were their intentions? The need tofind answers to these questions became all the more pressing once governmentofficials and Christian missionaries began seizing control of various aspects ofthe indigenous people’s lives, including land, natural resources, legal decisionmaking, and religious practice.What anthropologists called “cargo cults” represented an initial type ofresponse to the profoundly disorienting encounter with white civilization.13[notes.html#ch09fn13] Cargo cults focused people’s minds on a practicalquestion: How could they gain access to the sources of power controlled by thewhites? Drawing on the traditional belief that power is rooted in secret places,they searched the spirit world in dreams, visions, and emotionally arousingrituals, asking the ancestors for help and guidance. In multiple communities inand around New Guinea there arose certain individuals who prophesized theimminent arrival of magical vehicles that would bring a bounty of material goods(cargo) for all the people. The popular excitement and air of expectationgenerated by these visions was tremendous, despite the scorn of white officialswho regarded them as further proof of the natives’ pathetic ignorance. But thatkind of self-serving interpretation failed to recognize the deeper processes ofmeaning-making at work in the cargo cults. The wildfire appeal of these groupslay in their inspiring examples of daring, defiant creativity from thecharismatic leaders who sought access for everyone to the mysterious powers thatproduced cargo. At a fundamental level, the cults were generating a kind ofcollective dream force, trying to bend a frighteningly turbulent waking world tothe indigenous people’s spiritual will. Individual dreams were important, butmore important was the community’s united dreaming intentionality. Together theywould prepare themselves for a new and better reality, still rooted in ancestralwisdom yet creatively embracing the possibilities of the future.Ultimately, the cargo never arrived. The power disparity was too great, thesecret sources of white power too well hidden. So the dreams and visions lednowhere? Perhaps. Better, I think, to say they led where so many of the earliestseafaring explorers of Oceania went. Out of this world entirely.THE CHANGING PACIFICCargo cults were not the only type of spiritual reaction to the arrival of whitecivilization in Oceania. Over time, the indigenous peoples developed variousmeans of accommodating, adapting to, and in some cases appropriating the powersof the Christian authorities. While the cargo cults followed a millennialistimpulse that led them beyond the manifest limits of colonial reality, other newreligious movements worked to transform that reality from within. Much like theAfrican communities whose apparent conversions to Christianity and Islam maskeda deeper process of struggle and negotiation between traditional spiritualitiesand missionary imperatives, many in Oceania became Christian only insofar asthey could usefully incorporate the new teachings into their time-honoredreligious beliefs and practices. God, Jesus, angels, Satan, demons, all wereabsorbed into people’s imaginations but then creatively reworked andreinterpreted according to local traditions and needs. Some of the missionariesconsidered this a threat to their authority, whereas others saw it as a positivesign of missionary success. This tension is well illustrated in a report from aBaptist missionary who worked with the Enga people in the mid-twentiethcentury.14 [notes.html#ch09fn14] He described a “graveyard cult” initiated by aman named Pyanjuwa, a prominent member of the Enga community who was a leader inthe missionary church. One morning Pyanjuwa had a vision of Christ appearing tohim in brilliant white clothing and commanding him to clear the brush from theold village graveyard. Pyanjuwa immediately obeyed, and subsequent dreams andvisions inspired him to convene dawn services at the freshly landscapedgraveyard which were attended by crowds of increasingly enthusiastic people. Atthis point the missionary authorities became involved:Graveyards for many miles around were cleaned up and shrubs planted, and itseemed likely that the movement would spread. A meeting of the Church DistrictExecutive was convened to discuss the new movement. Many of the pastors saw itas an exciting new possibility for renewal in the churches, but others saw thedangers of incorporating beliefs from the old religion, especially in regard toancestor spirits. It was decided not to encourage the spread of the cult untilthe church leaders had time to observe its fruits. The pastors agreed that totry and ban the cult would send it underground, whereas for the present it wasoperating in the open and could easily be observed.Dramas like this unfolded everywhere the missionaries went. No furtherinformation is available about the subsequent development of Pyanjuwa’smovement, nor the church’s official evaluation of its “fruits,” but the natureof the dilemma itself is worth highlighting. The pastors were understandablytorn in their feelings toward Pyanjuwa. An inspiring dream of Jesus would seemto promote the Christian cause, but the graveyard ceremonies could only help torevive the ancestor worship that the missionaries were trying to stamp out.Their “wait-and-see” attitude signaled a pragmatic willingness to allow at leastsome space for traditional dreaming experience, combined with a realisticappraisal of the likely results if the pastors tried to impose a heavy-handedprohibition. Nevertheless their anxious uncertainty remained, and thedetermination to maintain constant surveillance over Pyanjuwa and his followerssuggested that the missionaries would show little patience with dreams orvisions that strayed too far from Christian orthodoxy.Still the dreaming continued, and continues to this day. In fact, the cargothemes and ancestral teachings have woven themselves so deeply into the modernChristian symbolic universe that it would be nearly impossible at this point toidentify most people in Oceania as completely Christian or completely notChristian. Consider these two dreams, from native Samoans who spoke with ananthropologist in the 1980s:[Fia, a young woman:] I had an unforgettable dream last night. … A handsomeprince from out of space came to my village and was on earth for the first time.His name was unknown and even the language he speaks was not understandable bymost people. … He dressed all [in] white and … [no] one knew where he came from,except that he travels around in his UFO. … He was kind. … He never showed anyhard face but he greets everyone with a big, friendly smile. He visits everyfamily of my village and writes things down on his small writing pad. When hewas done, he waved good-bye and was gone on this unidentified flying object. Twodays later … the people of my village were no longer sad but just happy. Theywere no longer poor, but rich. Everyone had their free will to do anything theywished.[Malaga, a young man:] “I was running up these stairs. I was running faster andfaster. I got to the top. A man dressed in white was waiting for me. He askedme, “Are you Malaga?” I said yes. “Well, sit down. Buckle up your safety belt.”Now we were in this spaceship … going to heaven. When we got to heaven, there hewas my great-grandfather Manga, the Paramount Chief. Then I seen him sign apiece of paper with this navy white guy. The paper was the treaty between Samoaand the United States. My grandfather told me to go to Samoa and get ready for abig hurricane that was about to come.”15 [notes.html#ch09fn15]Both these dreams made direct allusions to Christian imagery (the magical,benevolent men dressed in white) and modern technology (the amazing flyingmachines), but neither followed an orthodox Christian path nor succumbed to thedictates of modernization. Fia’s dream concluded with a classic cargo cultvision of abundance for all, and Malaga’s dream reunited him with a powerfulancestor who provided a valuable prophetic message. Despite the devastatingchanges imposed on them in the waking world, these Samoan people continued todream according to their traditional beliefs and expectations. Their dreamsaccurately reflected the hurricane-like impact of white civilization on theirculture, yet the dreaming itself testified to the continuing survival of atleast some aspects of their ancestral spirituality. More detailed informationthan this would be difficult to gather, but the available evidence indicatesthat dreaming has remained a vital resource for the peoples of Oceania in theirongoing efforts to reorient themselves and their communities in the midst of allthe cultural chaos and forced changes brought on by white colonization.The most common solution to the challenge was to adopt Christianity as a publicfaith but to continue practicing the traditional customs in private. This kindof secretive compromise was not easy to maintain, and the psychospiritualtension frequently played itself out in people’s dreaming. A senior ritual eldernamed Pa Rarovi from Tikopia, a small island southeast of New Guinea, reported aseries of dreams (miti) to an anthropologist that illustrated his dividedcondition.16 [notes.html#ch09fn16] Before he became a Christian Pa Rarovi wasbesieged by dreams in which evil female spirits tried to bewitch and seduce him.He used to pray to his Tikopian ancestors to protect him, but once he joined thechurch he started praying to the Christian God, and then he slept much better.One of his dreams seemed to confirm the wisdom of his choice. It started as anightmare, with a crowd of men threatening to shoot arrows at him; he ran away,and when he got to the beach he looked back at the hills and saw that they haddivided in two, creating a middle path. Down the path came two whites, one witha staff, who beckoned him to join them. Pa Rarovi did so, and he felt safe andprotected. Such a dream could serve as an allegory of the frightening process ofconversion itself, a vividly rendered experience of struggle, danger, andultimate salvation. Still, even after joining the church Pa Rarovi felt guiltyabout neglecting the spirits who had guarded him his whole life. He had alwaysbelieved that maintaining friendly and respectful relations with the ancestorswas absolutely essential to the well-being of his community, and he worried thatbecoming a Christian was disrupting those important relationships. One nightafter his conversion Pa Rarovi had another frightening dream:The spirit came to scold me! He said, “You rejected my rites; for what reasondid you go away?” Thereupon I woke up and was all limp. I spoke to him in arespectful manner. “Oh, I have gone to Church but I have not rejected you. WhenI bring in coconuts from the heart of the woods and pierce them [to drink] I donot raise them first to my lips; first I pour a libation to you.”This was exactly the kind of nightmare that Tikopian tradition taught was causedby a failure to show due respect and veneration for the ancestors. The feelingof limpness in his body upon awakening added a frightening physiologicalcarryover dimension, reminding Pa Rarovi of his existential vulnerability everytime he entered the realm of dreaming. Such a warning could not be ignored, andyet he could not risk the opposite danger of rejecting the missionaryauthorities. So Pa Rarovi tried to negotiate, seeking a pragmatic accommodationbetween the two sides of his divided spiritual identity, trying to satisfy thebasic needs of both without overly angering either, creatively maneuvering hisway through the challenges of each day, and each night. The tension betweenChristianity and traditional spirituality could only be held together byconstant improvisation, vigilance, and careful preservation of thepublic/private boundaries.In some communities the tension was too great to be borne. When the people ofFulaga, a tiny island near Fiji, converted to Methodism they totally rejectedany further worship of their ancestors, who were now considered to be devilstrying to drag people back into their sinful past.17 [notes.html#ch09fn17]Unfortunately, the Fulagans still accepted the reality of their dream-spiritexperiences during sleep, and thus every time they saw a dream (tadra) ofencountering an ancestor, a dead person, or any other being of pre-Christianspiritual power (animals, plants, natural forces) they believed they were trulyunder demonic attack. Such a large percentage of their dreams fell into thisproscribed category that the Fulagans began praying to the Christian God to givethem nothing but dreamless sleep. According to private reports gathered by ananthropologist, virtually everyone on the island still remembered his or herdreams every night, but no one talked about them openly, and the proper,socially expected response to the normal morning greeting “Did you have a dreamlast night?” became “No, I did not.”SUMMARYThe religious communities of Oceania (Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, andthe other island cultures of the south Pacific) have traditionally focused theirattention on the psychospiritual process of dreaming rather than on the analysisof individual dreams. The emphasis in these traditions is very much on thedreamer actively moving into the dreaming world rather than passively receivingan image or visitation. The origin of ordinary dreams is believed to be thehuman mind, but some dreams enable the soul to leave the body and journey to therealm of the ancestors. The power of connecting with the ancestors underlies allthe dream functions reported in Oceania, functions virtually identical to thosediscussed in the preceding chapters: prophetic knowledge, healing energy,guidance in times of crisis, and creative inspiration. The most unique featureof Oceania’s dream teaching is the relative lack of specialized systems fordream interpretation. For these peoples, dreams are treated as real experiencesthat in most cases do not require special analysis or decoding. They try as muchas possible to live the meanings of their dreams in action, ritual, andmovement. The more constricted their waking lives become in a white-dominatedworld, the more dreaming becomes a valued means of remaining in communion withthe revitalizing power of the ancestors."},{"pageContent":"10RELIGIONS OF THE AMERICASThe comparative study of dreaming makes its claims most persuasively when itfocuses on identifying patterns that are clear, simple, and widely distributed.A good example of this is dreaming about animals. Counting animal characters indream reports is a relatively easy analytic task, and multiple studies usingboth quantitative and qualitative methods have provided a great deal of dataregarding the frequency with which animals appear in dreams.1[notes.html#ch10fn1] Two findings stand out. First, adults in modern,large-scale industrial societies (the United States, Western Europe, Japan)rarely dream about animals, whereas children in those societies and adults fromsmaller, preindustrial societies (Australia, the Americas) dream about animalsmuch more frequently. Second, the most common form of interaction in theseanimal dreams is a nightmare scenario in which the animals are threatening orattacking the dreamer. By this point in the book, readers are apt to recognizethe most likely explanation for these two findings: the frequency of animals indreaming is continuous with the waking-life circumstances, experiences, andconcerns of the dreamer.Children in modern societies tend to have more frequent, intense, and complexrelationships with animals than adults do. This includes daily interactions withfamily and neighborhood pets; awareness of bugs, birds, and other creatures inthe local environment; strong attachments to stuffed animals; repeated storiesabout animals in books, movies, and television shows; and studies of wildlife inschool and field trips to farms and zoos. Many children grow up with family dogsthat are physically bigger than they are; few adults have the experience ofliving with a nonhuman creature larger than themselves. It does no disservice tochildren’s mental abilities to conclude that, compared to adults, they are moreaware of and interested in the animal world. Considering this waking-lifepreoccupation in light of the continuity principle, it follows that childrenwill report a higher frequency of animals in their dreams.For adults in small-scale societies who often dream of animals, the continuityprinciple also applies. The waking lives of tribal peoples depend on constantinteractions with animals both domesticated and wild, far more so than forpeople in modern industrial societies. In many small-scale societies people areconstantly vulnerable to life-threatening attack by aggressive animals. Tosurvive, the group’s members must devote considerable attention to defendingagainst such dangers. In such circumstances it is almost inevitable thatwaking-life concerns will find their way into the people’s dreams. Morespeculatively, that children in modern societies still dream so frequently ofanimal attacks may reflect an inherent imaginal predisposition to remainvigilant against the waking-world threats that pervaded the earliest ancestralenvironments of human evolution. A standard strategy of mammalian predators theworld over is to attack the youngest and weakest members of a group, and we mayassume that human children have always recognized their vulnerability in thisregard and done whatever possible to protect themselves. Even intwenty-first-century urban settings, children’s dreams and nightmares still echowith the primal growls and gnashing teeth of stalking beasts.All this is prelude to a consideration of dreaming in the multiple cultures andreligious traditions of the Americas. When the first bands of Homo sapienscrossed the land bridges from eastern Siberia into presentday Alaska sometimeduring the Upper Paleolithic period (40,000–10,000 BCE), they encountered aunique environmental opportunity: two vast, ecologically rich land masses filledwith an abundance of life forms that had flourished for millions of yearswithout any human contact or interaction.2 [notes.html#ch10fn2] Even more thanthe people who first discovered the tropical islands of Oceania, theadventuresome humans who survived the epic trek across the Bering Straits wererewarded with a glorious bounty of virgin land, and they soon establishedprosperous settlements throughout the length and breadth of the two continents.In the course of this rapid territorial expansion, the human immigrants wereforced by survival needs to develop fast, accurate knowledge regarding thevarious indigenous creatures whom they were encountering for the very firsttime—learning to recognize their forms and behaviors, accurately identifyingthem as potential dangers or potential nourishment, and comprehending theircomplex relations with other creatures and with the land. No wonder, then, thatwe find people’s dreaming experiences to be consistent with these wakingconcerns, serving them as valuable resources in their efforts at betterunderstanding the local flora and fauna. As this chapter will show, the manydifferent religious traditions of the Americas have long shared a fundamentalawareness of dreaming as a means of enhancing knowledge of, and control over,the creatures that had dwelt in this part of the world for countless millenniabefore the arrival of Homo sapiens.MISSIONARY ENCOUNTERSThere never has been a single, unitary religion to which all Native Americanshave pledged their faith. On the contrary, the diverse peoples who journeyed tothe Americas spread out both geographically and religiously, developing a widevariety of different languages, philosophical concepts, artistic expressions,and spiritual practices. Hundreds of distinct cultural groups have survived intothe present, and archeological evidence suggests that hundreds and perhapsthousands of other cultures rose and fell during the long era of humanoccupation prior to modern European contact. The challenges involved in studyingthe religious beliefs and practices of the earliest Americans are just asformidable as those we found in the study of Africa and Oceania. In addition totheir seemingly endless cultural diversity these traditions did not (with a fewexceptions) develop literacy as a means of recording their experiences. Theylived as semi-nomadic hunters who moved in small, lightly equipped groups,rarely engaging in the kinds of giant monument making or socially stratifiedcity building found among other ancient peoples. As a result, very littlephysical or textual evidence remains about their past activities. Complicatingmatters even further, the best sources of information available to contemporaryscholars are, once again, precisely those gathered by the original agents ofcolonial conquest—the missionaries, government officials, and ethnographers whorecorded their observations in the course of aiding the forced resettlementprocess imposed on the local communities. For all these reasons, anyinvestigation into the dream traditions of the earliest Americans is severelyconstrained in terms of the depth of its access to primary data and the range ofits explanatory insights.However, if there is a single theme that recurs throughout these religioustraditions, a single spiritual principle shared by virtually every culturalgroup in the Americas, it would have to be a profound respect for the powers ofdreaming. This, at any rate, was one of the strongest impressions reported bycolonizing Europeans when they found themselves face to face with the peoples ofthe New World. Consider the following passage, from a letter sent by a Jesuitmissionary in 1688 to his superiors regarding the progress of his evangelicalactivities among the Iroquois of the Great Lakes region in North America:The Iroquois have, properly speaking, only a single Divinity—the Dream. To itthey render their submission, and follow all its orders with the utmostexactness. Tsonnontouens [Seneca] are more attached to this superstition thanany of the others; their Religion in this respect becomes even a matter ofscruple; whatever it be, whatever it is that they think they have done in theirdreams, they believe themselves absolutely obliged to execute at the earliestmoment. The other nations content themselves with observing those of theirdreams which are the most important; but this people, which has the reputationof living more religiously than its neighbors, would think itself guilty of agreat crime if it failed in its observance of a single dream. The people thinkonly of that, they talk about nothing else, and all their cabins are filled withtheir dreams. They spare no pains, no industry, to show their attachmentthereto, and their folly in this particular goes to such an excess as would behard to imagine. He who has dreamed during the night that he was bathing runsimmediately, as soon as he rises, all naked, to several cabins, in each of whichhe has a kettleful of water thrown over his body, however cold the weather maybe. Another who has dreamed that he was taken prisoner and burned alive, hasfound himself bound and burned like a captive on the next day, being persuadedthat by thus satisfying his dream, this fidelity will avert from him the painand infamy of captivity and death. … Some have been known to go as far asQuebec, traveling a hundred and fifty leagues, for the sake of getting a dogthat they had dreamed of buying there.3 [notes.html#ch10fn3]The Jesuit father’s letter revealed at least as much about his own religioustradition as about the local people he was trying to describe. Given what welearned in chapter 6 [ch06.html#ch06] about developments in medieval Christiantheology that increasingly associated dreaming with devil worship andwitchcraft, the missionary encounter with a dream-saturated culture like that ofthe Iroquois was bound to be shocking, alienating, and frightening. The battlelines were immediately drawn: the God of the Christians versus the DreamingDivinity of the Iroquois. What most baffled the Jesuit father was the intensityof the native people’s efforts to properly respond in waking life to somethingseen in a dream. The father attributed this partly to the excessive religiouszeal of the Iroquois (this from a Jesuit missionary!) and partly to thewidespread veneration for dreaming among all the indigenous peoples he hadcontacted. We cannot know if his examples were representative of broaderpractices among the Iroquois, but it seems fairly clear that he was correct inidentifying a basic religious difference. In stark contrast to EuropeanChristianity, the sacred traditions of the Americas were openly andenthusiastically influenced by their dreaming. In both personal behavior andcollective decision making, dreams shaped the daily lives of these peoples inways that were impossible for the first European colonists to perceive asanything other than demonic heresies that must be eliminated.4[notes.html#ch10fn4]The religious battle for control of dreaming could also be found thousands ofmiles to the south, among the Quechua people of the Andes in present-day Peru.The Quechua were colonized in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by SpanishCatholics who worked energetically to destroy the local cultures and replacethem with Christian teachings.5 [notes.html#ch10fn5] Idolatry was strictlyforbidden, meaning that any kind of religious practice, belief, or experiencerelating to traditional spirituality was prohibited. Dream practices werenatural targets for this kind of attack. The missionaries directly challengedthe Quechua people’s beliefs about dreaming and rejected the authority of thetraditional leaders of dream divination, as expressed in this missionary’s bluntinstruction to turn away from past practices: “Don’t be keeping dreams: ‘Idreamed this or that, why did I dream it?’ Don’t ask: dreams are just worthlessand not to be kept.”The strategy here was not exclusively Christian, though Christian missionariesmade frequent use of it. In any struggle for political control, an effectivemeans of weakening the cognitive resistance of one’s opponents and disruptingtheir cultural integrity is to shut off the free flow of imaginal energy betweendreaming and waking. Break that dynamic spiritual connection, and no culture canlong survive the determined onslaught of another.Some of the missionaries felt an extra degree of urgency to finish the battle assoon as possible. The Jesuit father who visited the Iroquois realized that thelocal people’s extreme fidelity to their dreams had sinister potential for hisown well-being: “What peril we are in every day among people who will murder usin cold blood if they have dreamed of doing so; and how slight needs to be anoffense that a Barbarian has received from someone, to enable his heatedimagination to represent to him in a dream that he takes revenge on theoffender.” Most amazing, perhaps, is how few missionaries were in fact murderedin this way, despite giving the indigenous peoples ample cause to feel homicidalanger.CULTURES OF DREAMINGPerhaps there simply wasn’t enough time for their dreams to generate a moreaggressive defense of their traditions. The impact of colonization was swift anddevastating, with European infectious diseases wiping out whole communities andconquering armies finishing off the survivors. The genocidal effect of Europeansettlement in the Americas darkens anything we try to learn about the indigenouspeoples’ precolonization dream beliefs and practices. Simply put, the nativepeople had every reason to mistrust the European colonists, to lie about theirdream traditions, and to keep secret their most vital teachings. Every source ofinformation about early American dreaming is haunted by the bloody historicalclash between the Old World and the New.That said, a large body of evidence is still available regarding at least someof the most widespread and important roles of dreaming in traditional,pre-colonial lives. This evidence is broadly consistent with the shamanisticdream practices of Neolithic cultures in Europe and Asia, reflecting what isapparently a long-term process of cultural diffusion that shaped and influencedvirtually every human community that took root in the Americas. Wherever thesepeople went—plains, mountains, lakes, jungles, or coasts—they brought with thema tradition of dreaming, a time-honored respect for night visions as sources ofspiritual knowledge and communal guidance.As noted, these were primarily groups of hunters who lived in constantinteraction with other animals, both as predators and prey. Dreaming served themmost directly and practically as a means of enhancing their power in relation tothe animals. For example, among the Cree people of modern-day Quebec each adultmale formed a special relationship with the powatakan, the animal spirits whoappeared in dreams to guide hunters toward success in waking life.6[notes.html#ch10fn6] The Cree hunters reciprocated for the assistance of thepowatakan by performing rituals, sacrifices, and prayers of gratitude. Everyoneknew of the powatakan and discussed them in general terms, but each hunter wascareful to keep the exact nature of his own dreams a secret from everyone else,lest the spirit-given power be misused or lost. In the 1930s an elderly Cree manwas willing to tell ethnographers about his powatakan dreams because he nolonger needed them:I can’t hunt anymore because though I dream I can’t remember them when I get upin the morning. … Every animal I killed I dreamed about. I first dreamed aboutMemekwesiw [Bear, his personal animal spirit] before I was married when I wasyet living with my father. In my dream I thought I went to Memekwesiw’s placeand I thought the door was of stone. He had a hairy face and hair hanging downall over. He came and got hold of my hand. There were lots of trees standing ina bunch and he said to me, “That is where my little pup is.” … I didn’t tell mydream but the next day I put on my new mittens and went out hunting. At theplace I had been shown I found a bear and killed it. I took a branch that thebear had broken off and went back to camp. I didn’t say a word, just as though Ihadn’t killed anything. I gave the branch to my father who knew right away itwas Memekwesiw’s little dog that had broken the branch. He went for the bear andbrought it back to the tent. He laid him on his back and placed tobacco on hischest. Then we made a currant cake in the oven and put the cake on his chestbecause he likes blueberries. The women skinned the bear and then I cut it upmyself. Then at one side in the tent I spread a cloth and all the men sat on oneside of it and the women on the other side of it. The children sat together inanother place. That first time I killed a bear I put some meat in the fire andsaid, “Be pleased, Memekwesiw, so you will let go your pup soon again.”Memekwesiw, the great Spirit of the Bears, willingly gave this Cree hunter theinformation he needed to find and kill a bear, and the Cree hunter willinglygave thanks in return to Memekwesiw by means of an elaborate communal ceremony.Dreaming, hunting, celebrating, praying—these practices formed a self-sustainingcircuit of spiritual knowledge that embraced all forms of experience within aframework of sacred meaning. The reciprocal relationship between humans,animals, and dream-spirits was central to the worldview of the Cree and manyother early American cultures. The people needed to hunt for their survival, butthey knew that taking an animal’s life tore a piece out of the denselyinterwoven spiritual fabric of the land. Dreaming offered a mediating experienceby which humans bowed to the superior power of Nature’s elemental life forces,in exchange for which they were granted the hunting success they needed to liveand prosper.To some extent, this could be considered a religious version of the contemporaryscientific idea that dreaming sometimes enables the mind to find creativesolutions to problems in waking life that are difficult, pressing, and notentirely in human control (like trying to find enough wild game to support anomadic community). What the Cree called Powatakan could in this view beunderstood as the personification of unconscious thought processes thatcontinued working on such problems while the conscious mind slept. This suggestsa degree of directionality to the dreaming-waking relationship: that which ismost vividly represented in dreaming tends to revolve around, and seek creativeresolution of, highly salient waking-life problems and challenges. The processshould not be regarded as permanent or automatic, however. Just as prayers andrituals could enhance it, deteriorating cultural circumstances could diminishit. The Cree man’s experience of no longer remembering his dreams and thus notbeing able to hunt reflected the sudden disruption of his community’s traditionsand the people’s near-total reliance now on white civilization.Farther to the south and west, the Mohave people of the present-day ColoradoRiver basin referred to their special power-inducing night visions as “dreamslucky” (sumach ahot), which they distinguished from “ordinary dreams” (sumach).7[notes.html#ch10fn7] In their sumach ahot the Mohave gained hunting guidance,methods of healing, bravery for a coming battle, new songs and prayers, andother forms of practical wisdom. They talked each day among their families andfriends about their dreams from the previous night, particularly any bad dreamswhose ill effects could be prevented by the right kinds of ritual practice. Anespecially good dream like a sumach ahot, however, was often kept secret topreserve its power. Still farther southward, the Quiche people of the CentralGuatemalan highlands used the transitive verb wachic’aj (“to dream of”), withthe connotation that dreaming was an active process of the dreamer relating tosomething or someone else.8 [notes.html#ch10fn8] This sense of personal agencyin dreaming inspired the Quiche to travel in free-soul form (uwach uk’ij ornawal) through their dreams to seek out the free souls of animals and otherpeople. They regularly shared their dreams in public settings, and they taughttheir children to try to remember their dreams every single night. The mostpowerful dreams were those in which the dreamer received a visitation from anancestor or god; in such dreams the Quiche believed the individual’s lightningsoul (coyopa) should wrestle with the spirit being until it granted the dreamera divine message. Sometimes, however, the Quiche were afflicted with c’ulwachic,horrible dreams that Western psychology would diagnose as night terrors: “Whenone is in bed, not yet really sleeping but in the white sleep (sak waram,analogous to hypnogogia?), then comes the apparition; it is represented. Aperson comes right up to touch one, one feels they are coming to touch onedirectly, but one can neither move nor cry out.”9 [notes.html#ch10fn9]This underscores the wariness most early Americans felt toward personal dreamexperiences. Going to sleep meant surrendering to a realm of harrowingexistential vulnerability, leaving the individual defenseless against externalattack and exposed to internal threats from mysterious spirit enemies. A goodexample of this cultural circumspection toward dreaming comes from theMakiritare people of the mountainous river valleys of present-day Venezuela, whoconceived of dreams as voyages of the adekato, the spirit double that lieswithin each person.10 [notes.html#ch10fn10] The Makiritare believed thesenocturnal travels were always dangerous because the lone adekato could at anymoment be assaulted, abducted, or afflicted with a fatal illness. Dreams broughta person precariously close to death, and, as a result, the Makiritareapproached dreaming with profound caution. In the Watunna, the oral compositionof Makiritare myth and sacred history, these dangers were illustrated by a storyabout a woman whose brother tricked her into being bitten by a snake:Now she began dreaming. Her adekato went traveling outside her body. It wentdreaming to Nomo’s house, to the mistress of that poison. Now dreaming the womansaid, “I’m thirsty. Give me something to drink.” Now Nomo came out with a gourdin her hand: “Here, drink this iukuta. It’ll make you better.” The woman tookthe gourd. It wasn’t iukuta. It was a trick. When she drank it, she forgot herempty body there on earth. She stayed there dreaming, dreaming forever as aspirit in Nomo’s house. She’s still a prisoner there because of the drink Nomogave her, when she told her: “Here, take this iukuta.” She never returned to herbody. That’s how she died. Now she’s like a spirit in the Snake House. Becauseof that poison. Because of the wickedness of her brother.Another passage of the Watunna carried this theme of dreaming danger all the wayback to the creation of the world by the culture-hero Wanadi, child of the Sun,who first brought humans into existence. One time during his process ofcreation, Wanadi came into direct conflict with Odo’sha, the master of the darkforces of the earth:Wanadi sat down, silent, calm, not eating, not doing anything. He put his elbowson his knees, his head in his hands. He was just thinking, dreaming. Dreaming.That’s the way Wanadi did everything. “This is what I dream,” he would say. “I’mdreaming there’s lots of food.” No food came. Odo’sha was right in front of him.Odo’sha didn’t want that. He started dreaming evil. He answered Wanadi withevil. “I dreamed: we have cassava,” said Wanadi, dreaming. “This is my dream,”answered Odo’sha. “Lots of hunger.” He was answering with evil. [Wanadi said,]“I’m dreaming there are conucos. There’s yucca everywhere. I’m cutting down theyucca. There’s a great harvest.” “Here’s how I dreamed it first,” answeredOdo’sha. “Many sick people.”The primordial forces of creation and destruction eternally battled each otherin the Makiritare notion of dreaming. The final outcome of this mythic conflictwas unknown, leaving humans to face a dangerous and uncertain future. In suchconditions the best the Makiritare could do was remain vigilant for all possiblethreats and deceptions, guarding their most important cultural traditions anddeveloping whatever new powers they could to promote their personal and communalsurvival. Keeping close watch on their dreams was a vital part of this effort.Every morning the men of the Makiritare villages gathered to discuss the comingday’s activities, and dreams from the previous night were included as relevantinformation in making group decisions.For the Makiritare and other small communities in the Amazon River basin, thegeographic remoteness of their living areas shielded them from contact withEuropean colonists and their descendents until much more recently, with lessdamaging cultural effects. In many cases, the native peoples have beengovernmentally protected to enable them to continue with their traditionalpractices, and their material lives today remain largely the same as before. Butof course their knowledge of white civilization has profoundly impacted theirview of reality, a process that can be clearly tracked within their dreaming.The Mehinaku people of central Brazil provide a good illustration of this. Likemost other indigenous traditions throughout the Americas, the Mehinaku dreamedof aggressive interactions with animals far more often than occurs with peopleliving in modern urban societies.11 [notes.html#ch10fn11] The rain forestenvironment of the Mehinaku was, in fact, filled with dangerous wild animalslike jaguars, wild pigs, snakes, and poisonous insects, providing fertilegrounds for nightmarish anticipations of actual waking-world threats. Alsoconsistent with what we have found in other traditions, the Mehinaku made abasic distinction between dreams of greater and lesser significance. Jepuni hete were “mere dreams” reflecting ordinary events of daily life, and jupuni yajawere “true dreams” providing valuable information about the future. Occasionallya person’s jupani yaja were strong enough to mark the dreamer as a possibleinitiate for training by local shamans. The Mehinaku believed that the processof dreaming involved the nightly wanderings of a shadow soul (iyeweku) residingin each person’s eyes. What was seen in a dream was accepted as a realexperience of the eye soul, with potentially (though not automatically)meaningful significance for waking life. During the night and each morning theMehinaku shared their dreams with one another, sifting through the images forsymbolic omens of the future. Of those dream portents they agreed to describe toethnographers, many revolved around themes of sexuality and reproduction,including dreams of explicit sexual behavior and dreams the Mehinaku interpretedas sexually meaningful even though there was no direct sexual imagery in thedream itself. Animal aggression dreams were very frequent, as noted above, aswere dreams relating to disease, death, and loss of personal integrity.Not surprisingly, the most dangerous characters in Mehinaku dreams were whitepeople. The Brazilian government established a small air force base near theirvillage, and although the official policy was to leave the Mehinaku to their ownaffairs, the intimidating presence of the whites was enough to prompt acontinuous stream of nightmarish warnings. Some examples:At the post a plane landed. Many, many passengers got off. It seemed as if therewas a village in the plane. I was very frightened of them and the things theycarried. I was afraid they would bring a disease to the village, the white man’s“witchcraft.”We were at the air force base, and a soldier wanted to have sex with my sister.He took her arm and tried to pull her away. We shouted at the soldier and at mysister. My aunt and I tried to pull her back. But the soldier was too strong forus. He was very strong. He said, “If you don’t let me have sex with Mehinakuwomen I will shoot you.” I got a gun and shot at him, many times. But he washidden and I couldn’t see him.A guard pointed a gun at me. He told me to go through a door. I did. The roomwas filled with a beautiful light. The guard gave me a watch and told me I couldcome out at a certain time. He locked the door. I looked at the watch, and Irealized I did not know how to tell time. There was a wind and a strange smell.In waking life the interactions between the Mehinaku and the whites wereinfrequent and fairly benign. But in the Mehinaku people’s dreams the Braziliancharacters were almost always figures of extreme hostility, unpredictability,and lethality. The dreams were expressing not what was happening at the moment,but what might happen in the immediate future. Although discontinuous withactual waking-life events, the dreams were continuous with the well-justifiedMehinaku anxiety that any contact with the Brazilian officials was potentiallydangerous. A powerful new predator had entered the Mehinaku cosmos, and thepeople’s dreams were telling them to beware.12 [notes.html#ch10fn12]The anthropological data we have considered so far represents only a tinyfraction of the countless number of different cultural groups that have peopledthe Americas over the past ten thousand to twenty thousand years. But even thisbrief survey of a few traditions—the Cree, Mohave, Quiche, Makiritare, andMehinaku—suggests a deeply ingrained culture of dreaming shared widely among theearliest Americans, spreading across both continents and taking root in manydifferent kinds of environments. The dream traditions seem to have beenespecially influential in smaller-scale communities, and there is some evidencethat interest in dreaming diminished in larger societies that adopted anagricultural system of food production.13 [notes.html#ch10fn13] For example, inone text from the Aztec civilization (fourteenth to sixteenth centuries CE)dreaming is mentioned in passing as an inferior form of knowing and being:“Therefore, the ancients said that when they died, men did not perish, but beganto live again almost as if awakened from a dream and that they became spirits orgods.”14 [notes.html#ch10fn14] Insufficient information remains from theMesoamerican civilizations of the Olmecs, Mayans, and Aztecs to determine if alessening of dream interest with the shift from small-scale hunting tolarge-scale agricultural societies is genuine and not just an artifact oflimited research data. If true, it would provide an intriguing counterpoint tothe dream traditions of early agricultural civilizations in India, China, andMesopotamia.VISION QUESTThe two dozen or so cultural groups who lived in the expansive prairies,valleys, and forests of central North America, practiced what appears to be themost sophisticated ritual technique of dream incubation found in the Americas.Variously known as the vision quest, the dream fast, or crying for a vision, itinvolved a series of ritual preparations aimed at eliciting power-bestowingvisionary experiences, either in waking or dreaming.15 [notes.html#ch10fn15] Foradolescents, the vision quest served as an all-important rite of passage,transforming them into spiritually powerful individuals capable of assumingadult responsibilities in their families and bands. This association with thelife cycle transition of adolescence meant that the dream-seeking rituals werebeing practiced at a time when the young people were in the midst of a rapid andtumultuous phase of psychophysiological growth with fundamental shifts inbrain-mind functioning. If one’s goal is to generate a dream vision of maximumpower and long-lasting impact, adolescence would be an exceptionally fertiletime to make the attempt.The vision quest process was usually initiated by a parent or grandparent whotold the child it was time—based on what precise signs or indicators, we do notknow. A period of fasting would begin, with sharp restrictions on the intake offood and water. The child (usually a boy, but girls were occasionally allowed toparticipate) was brought to a sacred place far removed from ordinary villagelife. In high places like hills and buttes, in the dark foliage of primevalforests, in caves and rock formations decorated with ancient paintings andpictograms, the child was left alone to pray for a vision from the animalspirits. Having grown up hearing stories about other people’s vision quests, theyouth would probably have formed some expectations of what was to come and wouldfeel a degree of safety knowing that other people had survived the ordeal.Nevertheless, the ritual was deliberately designed to place the child in acondition of extreme physical pain and emotional distress—socially isolated,deprived of food and water, exposed to the elements, and vulnerable to attack bywild animals. Judged by contemporary American legal standards, these practiceswould probably be considered child abuse. But in the religious context of theGreat Plains traditions, the vision quest was a highly effective means ofstimulating, training, and focusing the personal powers most valued in theirculture. If the quest was successful (and not all were), it emblazoned alifelong religious stamp on the individual’s personality. By pushing a child’sbodily endurance to its very limits, the ritual sparked the emergence of anextraordinary vision that became the living touchstone for his or her futureadult identity. For those seekers who were able to overcome their natural fearsand maintain a respectful intentionality, the visions provided an opportunityfor unique spiritual insights and discoveries.Consider the following from an Ojibwa man named Agabegijik who described hisdream fast to an ethnographer in the early nineteenth century.16[notes.html#ch10fn16] When he was a “half-grown lad” Agabegijik’s grandfathertook him to the forest to seek a dream, but the boy broke the fast by drinkingwater from a nearby stream. As a result, his grandfather had to take him backhome in failure. The next spring Agabegijik resolved to do better, and he wentby himself to a small island in the middle of an ice-covered lake. There hebuilt an elevated bed in the branches of a red pine tree and lay down to waitfor a dream.In the first nights nothing appeared to me; all was quiet. But on the eighthnight I heard a rustling and waving in the branches. It was like a heavy bear orelk breaking through the shrubs and forest. I was greatly afraid. I thoughtthere were too many of them, and I made preparations for flight. But the man whoapproached me, whoever he may be, read my thoughts and saw my fear at adistance; so he came towards me more and more gently, and rested, quitenoiselessly, on the branches over my head. Then he began to speak to me, andasked me, “Are you afraid, my son?”“No,” I replied; “I no longer fear.”“Why are you here in this tree?”“To fast.”“Why do you fast?”“To gain strength, and know my life.”“That is good.”From there Agabegijik described flying into the sky with the spirit-being,meeting a group of four men sitting around a large white stone, ascending aladder to receive precious medicines and animal lore, then returning to his bedin the red pines with a final admonition from the four men—“Forget nothing ofall that has been said to you. And all who sit round here will remember you, andpray for you as your guardian spirits.” When he awoke, Agabegijik did as he wastold, and for the rest of his life he regarded this dream as the foundationalexperience for his career as a healer.After making the transition from childhood to adulthood, people of the GreatPlains continued to practice the vision quest whenever they felt the need foradditional guidance, knowledge, and power. Whether motivated by a desire forhunting information, healing methods, courage in battle, or insights into thefuture, the basic ritual of the dream fast remained a culturally approved meansof maintaining a living connection with the spirit realm. As already noted, theearliest Americans were very cautious in telling other people about their highlysignificant dream-visions. Such experiences were considered precious gifts ofpower, not to be carelessly squandered in idle talk. Only in special ceremoniesamong a trusted audience would a person share the specific results of his or herquest. But spoken words about dreams were not nearly as important to the GreatPlains people as actions inspired by dreams. The proper response to a powerfuldream was to actualize it, to carry its energy, imagery, and intentionality intothe waking world. In practical terms, this could take the form of creating a newdesign for a weapon or piece of clothing, retelling a traditional myth with newimages from the dream, testing the medicinal uses of a particular herb, ororganizing a group ceremony of spiritual renewal. The people of the Great Plainswere avid explorers of dreaming consciousness who freely experimented with thepotentials of their visionary capacities. Few human societies have ever been asfluid and flexible in allowing individual dreams to shape the behavioralcontours of daily life.Of course, being human, even they were prone to false steps andmisinterpretations. Such is the case with the dream vision of a Blackfoot man:The male hawk came and put me to sleep right where I was. This hawk immediatelyturned into a man, wearing a buffalo robe who addressed me, “My son, leave thechildren alone. I will give you my body that you may live long. Look at me. I amnever sick. So you will never have any sickness. I will give you power to fly.You see that ridge (about a mile away), well, I will give you power to flythere.” On awakening … I took off my clothes, and with a buffalo robe went backsome distance from the edge of the river. Then I took a run and springing fromthe edge of the cliff, spread out my arms with the blanket for wings. I seemedto be going all right for a moment, but soon lost control and fell. I wasstunned by the fall and was drawn under a rock by the [river] current where Iwent round and round, striking my head. … This is one time in which I was fooledin my dreams.17 [notes.html#ch10fn17]DREAMER RELIGIONSWe do not know how far back in time the peoples of the Great Plains practicedvision quest rituals. But once the European settlers began arriving and pushingtheir sphere of control farther and farther westward, the indigenous peoplesincreasingly turned to dreams and visions for help in defending their lands andcultural traditions. Like the Independent Churches of Africa and the cargo cultsof Oceania, numerous movements of spiritual renewal sprang up in the Americas(North America especially) aiming at the creation of new syntheses of pastreligious traditions with the white-dominated reality of the present. Theleaders of these movements (e.g., Handsome Lake of the Iroquois, Smohalla of theWanapum) were inspired by vibrant dream visions to teach their people a betterpath to the future, calling for greater devotion to core religious practices anddeeper reliance on traditional spiritual powers. Scornfully referred to as“Dreamer Religions” by U.S. government officials in the nineteenth century, themovements had strong appeal for the disoriented and dispirited survivors ofwhite expansionism.18 [notes.html#ch10fn18] Considering these Dreamer Religionsfrom a comparative historical perspective, what looked to the U.S. officialslike the stubborn superstitions of a primitive race is better understood as areasonable (if desperate) attempt by an oppressed group to preserve its culturalintegrity and powers of imagination. When all else is lost, dreaming offers akind of spiritual life-preserver that keeps people afloat in times of crisis,rejuvenating their hopes and illuminating possible remedies for their sufferingsin waking life.Two final examples underscore the continuing influence of dreaming on culturaladaptation in post-white contact times. The first comes from theAlgonquian-speaking Menomini people of present-day Wisconsin, where a small,mystically inclined society of dreamers (nemowuk, “dancing men”) practicedritual drumming, tobacco smoking, and ceremonial dream singing.19[notes.html#ch10fn19] The founding myth of this group (as recounted to an earlytwentieth-century ethnographer) originated in an unintentional vision quest by arefugee girl:Many years ago, during a war between the Indians and the whites, the nativeswere driven out of their country. A young girl became separated from the rest ofher party and secreted herself in the bushes until dark, when she made her wayto a river and hid under an overhanging bank. There she remained for eight days.All that time she had nothing to eat and saw no one. As she fasted with adowncast heart, a spirit came to her in her hiding place, and called to her inher own language: “Poor little girl. Come out and eat. It is time for you tobreak your fast. Do not be afraid, I am going to give you happiness because yourpeople have been expelled from their country, and because of your suffering youhave won my pity. Now your troubles are at an end. Go and join the enemy, butsay nothing. Go to their table, help yourself, and no one shall see that you arenot one of them. Then come away and you shall find your friends. You shalltravel through the thick forests and over open plains, even among the whitepeople, but fear nothing. Look straight ahead and not backwards or downwards.Even though the white people pass so closely in front of you as almost to touchyou, do not fear, for they shall not see you.”After teaching her this magical power of moving invisibly through whitecivilization, the spirit went on to instruct the girl in the proper constructionof a drum called “grandfather,” which could be used any time she and her peopleneeded help. When the girl finally reunited with her people they were amazed andinspired by her vision, and an elite group of “dancing men” decided to committhemselves to carrying out the spirit’s teachings. In addition to makingexquisitely crafted drums and percussion instruments, the members of the dreamersociety devoted considerable time to decorating staffs, fans, pipes, andheaddresses. The rituals themselves were held in open dancing grounds or insidelog cabins, and could last as long as four days. The secrecy surrounding theMenomini ceremonies meant that outsiders would never know the full nature of thedreams they shared or the knowledge they developed. What was fairly clear,however, was that by dreaming, drumming, and dancing together the participantsrenewed their feelings of cultural coherence and reoriented themselves towardthe future. As leading members of Menomini society whose decisions directlyimpacted the survival prospects of the group as a whole, the “dancing men”sought the strongest possible guidance from the spirits of dream and vision.The final tradition to consider, the Onondaga people of present-day New York,continued practicing well into the twentieth century a midwinter ceremony thatrevolved around a collective game of dream-guessing.20 [notes.html#ch10fn20]Conducted over three days and three long, dark nights near the time of thewinter solstice, the game was played by a whole village divided into twomoieties (clan groups) that gathered in different public meeting houses.Individuals from one house walked to the other people’s house and told them adream in riddle form. The people in that house tried to guess what the dream wasfrom the clues given, and once they discovered the correct answer they gave tothe individual from the other house the object about which he or she haddreamed. For example, “it whistles in the wind” might refer to a dream of a cornhusk spirit, and “it has holes, yet it catches” could indicate a dream of alacrosse stick. The two clan groups competed in their skillfulness asinterpreters and their generosity as fulfillers of dream wishes. A sense oflight-hearted playfulness characterized the whole process, and when a difficultdream riddle was finally guessed the people burst out with laughter andapplause. The ceremony ended at the close of the third night when the number ofaccurately guessed dreams was added up and publicly announced along with thenames of the dreamers.Such a ritual could not help but enhance and strengthen people’s feelings ofcreative bonding with the group. By establishing a relaxed and good-naturedatmosphere in which to share their dreams, the Onondaga encouraged each personto contribute a bit of his or her personal dream energy to the collectiveritual. The people teased and joked with each other at that tense interpersonalborder between secrecy and disclosure, revealing their deepest desires only tothose who truly knew and respected them. The material objects given to thedreamers were markers in the physical world for the spiritual powers disclosedin their dreams, and thus the group validated each member’s potential to be anauthentic voice of religious truth. All in all, the dream-guessing rite servedas a vital cultural resource for this small, embattled group of people who wereconfined to a reservation designated for them by the U.S. government.As testimony to the long-term power of this ritual, Jesuit missionariesdescribed a virtually identical midwinter ceremony among the Onondaga more thanthree hundred years previously, in the late 1600s:There are two divisions of that tribe [the Onondaga], one that is called theWolf Tribe and the other the Bear Tribe and they have two council houses; theyseparate, one gathering at the small council house and holding services there,and the other at the large council house at the same time; every little while amessage will be sent from one council house to the other. … A woman came in witha mat, which she spread out and arranged as if she wished to catch some fish.She thus indicated that some must be given to her to satisfy her dream. … Itwould be cruelty, nay murder, not to give a man the subject of his dream; forsuch a refusal might cause his death.The continuity of this ritual over so many centuries, despite the radicalchanges forced upon the Onondaga by white civilization, reflects a remarkabledurability in the core spiritual traditions of their culture.MANIFEST DREAMINGThe Europeans who moved into the Americas in the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies were driven by a kind of shared dream of the “New World,” which theyenvisioned as a place of boundless possibility, a God-given paradise for theirpersonal enjoyment. For conquistadores and other military explorers, it was aplace where their weapons were invincible and they could defeat huge armies withmagical ease. For Catholic missionaries, it offered a vast new population ofpotential converts to the faith. For Protestants, the North American coloniesrepresented a religious sanctuary where they could worship in isolated purity.For the rising commercial classes of the early industrial age, the Americaspresented an incredible bounty of natural resources just waiting to be seized,exploited, and sold on the growing global marketplace. For political radicalsfrustrated with European monarchies, the New World gave them opportunities toexperiment with representative democracy and utopian social arrangements. Forthe captive Africans shipped across the Atlantic as slaves, the Americas were anightmare of cruelty and humiliation; in response they created their own“Dreamer Religions,” adaptively developing new visions and spiritual teachingsthat combined the lost traditions of their African homelands with the Christianworld of their enslaved present.21 [notes.html#ch10fn21]In this way the human presence in North America was radically transformed by theinflux of millions of new people from a multitude of different cultures, all ofwhom brought with them the dreaming (or anti-dreaming) traditions of theirancestors. In economic practice, the European immigrants were typical of mostruling powers in human history in that they generated their wealth by seizingthe lands of weaker groups and exploiting the labor of slaves. Yet, in politicaltheory, many of the Euro-Americas were inspired to try and create a new kind ofsocial organization that gave ultimate power to the citizens (originallyrestricted to white men), a system that protected religious freedom and put itstrust in the common sense, good judgment, and moral imagination of ordinarypeople. The Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the ratification of the U.S.Constitution in 1788 and Bill of Rights in 1791 made manifest a narrow butpowerful vision of innate human dignity in which the purpose of government wasto create, sustain, and defend a sphere within which its citizens were free todream.But that is another historical tale.SUMMARYThroughout the religious traditions of the Americas, dreams have played acentral role in giving meaning and purpose to people’s lives. Dream experienceshave enabled them to interact with animal spirits and other mythic beings whohave directly influenced their waking-life activities. Most of these cultureshave been aware of physical and psychological factors in dreaming, but theirprimary interest has been trying to strengthen people’s ability to form mutuallybeneficial alliances with powerful forces in the spirit world. An individual’sdreams are a portal to that world, and their highest function is to enable afree flow of experience and energy between the waking and dreaming realms.Because of their emphasis on respect for the spirits, the people of the Americashave been very cautious about revealing their methods of dream interpretation.In many of their cultures a kind of communal dream-sharing has prevailed inwhich families, friends, and village elders talk each morning about theirprevious night’s dreams and what they might mean. When practiced over a longperiod of time, we can imagine that these dream conversations would have thepotential to generate an unusually deep and well-integrated sense of collectiveself-awareness and spiritual creativity. In such cases, the epithet “DreamerReligions” might be taken as a badge of pride."},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONThe stories that I have told, analyzed, and compared in the ten chapters of thisbook provide a basic historical context for understanding the major patterns andthemes of human dreaming. They provide a necessary resource for the comparativestudy of religion and for scientific investigations into the evolving dynamicsof the brain-mind system. Any general theory in dream research, religiousstudies, or the science of consciousness that fails to take this historicalmaterial into account should, in my view, be considered inadequate. Dreams anddreaming have been a widely recognized and highly valued part of humanlife—particularly in relation to people’s religious beliefs and practices—invirtually every cultural community known to have populated the planet. Althoughwe should always acknowledge the methodological limitations in how much we canunderstand of dream reports from people in different places and time, theextensive multidisciplinary research presented in this book makes the case for anew appreciation of dreaming as an integral element of healthy human functioningand development. The best way, in my view, to summarize all this information andilluminate its ultimate significance is to see dreaming as a primal wellspringof religious experience. This means that dreams, by virtue of their naturalemergence out of the immensely complex, internally generated activities of themammalian brain during sleep, offer all human beings a potential source ofvisionary insight, creative inspiration, and expanded self-awareness. Theabundant evidence of cross-cultural history proves that we are indeed a dreamingspecies. Through dreams humans have discovered the deepest realms of theirpsyches and grown in awareness of the powerful relational bonds that connectthem to their families, communities, natural environments, religious traditions,and ultimately the cosmos itself. What comes through the historical record withunmistakable clarity is the powerful impact of dreaming as an experiential agentof psychological growth and spiritual enlightenment.COMPARING RELIGIOUS AND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON DREAMINGIn the introduction we considered several key findings of contemporaryscientific research on sleep and dreaming. Now, at the conclusion, let usrevisit the scientific findings described at the outset and evaluate them inlight of the cumulative findings of research on the world’s religioustraditions.Sleep. An alternating cycle of waking and sleeping has been reported in allhuman populations in all periods of history. Consistent with current scientificresearch, sleep has been generally recognized in the world’s cultures andreligions as an absolute necessity for biological health. More than that, sleepis usually considered a pleasurable blessing that brings rest, recuperation, andrelief from the toils and cares of waking life. At the same time, people in manydifferent cultures have also expressed considerable fear about the dangers thatcome with sleep. They have understood that while sleeping we relax our physicalguard and withdraw perceptual attention from the waking world, leaving ourbodies vulnerable to attack from wild animals or antagonistic humans. Manyreligious traditions have further taught that during sleep people are alsovulnerable to attack from malevolent spiritual beings like ghosts, witches, anddemons. Although belief in such beings might seem impossible to reconcile withcontemporary cognitive science, I have argued that significant scholarlyprogress can be made without getting bogged down in debates over natural vs.supernatural causation. The focus in this book has been on a different kind ofquestion, namely, how best to understand the felt qualities and experientialpatterns of the most intensified types of dreaming as reported in multipleplaces and times. A pragmatic approach like mine sets aside metaphysicalcontroversies and concentrates instead on providing an empirically basedphenomenology of the recurrent forms, functions, and personal meanings of humandream experience.Following this approach, we can see that the sleeping incidents of spirit attackso frequently described in the literature of religious history correspond veryclosely to contemporary psychological research on nightmares and night terrors.1[notes.html#concfn1] The extreme fear, the dreadful feelings of paralysis andconstriction, the shockingly realistic imagery, the haunting specter of death—inall these details the nocturnal spirit attacks reported in many differentreligious traditions closely match the primary features of nightmares and nightterrors as observed by modern science. The first lesson to draw from thiscorrespondence is a methodological one: dream reports from different religiousand cultural traditions should be accepted as accurate sources of informationabout actual human dream experiences. Whatever doubts one may have about theauthenticity of particular dream episodes, the deeper drumbeat of prototypicaldreaming experiences cannot be ignored. Religious history may fare poorly as asource of episodic memory about specific dreams, but it serves as an excellentrepository of information on the human species’ semantic memory regarding thefull range and potentiality of dreaming.The second lesson goes to a more substantive point about the impact ofnightmares and night terrors on the individuals who suffer them. In culturesworldwide and throughout history, these kinds of dreams have provoked urgentconscious reflections on dark existential questions of evil, suffering, death,and finitude. People’s interpretations have naturally gravitated towardreligious and spiritual ideas, since the dreams themselves are so clearly feltto be encounters with, or possessions by, overwhelmingly powerful nonhumanentities. Following a pragmatic approach, I set aside the metaphysical conceptsused in different religions and focus instead on the pan-human process by whichnightmarish experiences in sleep provoke greater existential self-awareness inwaking life. Contemporary scientists should acknowledge that nightmares andnight terrors regularly have this kind of psychospiritual impact on people.Particularly at a time when mental health professionals are seeking improvedmethods of treating people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),the value of recognizing and actively working with the dimensions of existentialfear and religious transformation in dreaming can be tremendous if thetherapeutic goal is to heal the whole person (as opposed to simply eliminatinghis or her behavioral symptoms).All in all, the world’s religious traditions and modern science strongly agreethat sleep is an overall benefit and necessity for healthy human existence, eventhough people are perennially vulnerable to vivid, emotionally upsetting sleepexperiences at various times in their lives.Prototypical dreams. In the folk psychology of many religious traditions thesleeping condition of the body is believed to enable the liberation of aspiritual essence within the individual, freeing it to journey in otherworldlyrealms and encounter nonhuman forces and intelligences. This inner spirit orsoul varies in strength and mobility, and religions have devised various methodsfor cultivating its power so that people can fight off bad dreams and enhancegood ones. Considered purely in descriptive terms, the dreams most oftenreported by people in these religious traditions are identical to the types ofdreams found by contemporary researchers to recur with special intensity andmemorability in present-day populations. We do not have enough data to sayanything definitive about individual rates of dream recall in past times, norcan we be sure about the exact frequency of particular dream characteristics.But we have more than enough evidence to recognize the recurrence of a broadrange of prototypical dreams across all human groups.image [../images/f0272-01.jpg]Fig. 1. Protoypical DreamingI find it most useful, and most empirically grounded, to think of four differentdirections of intensified dreaming, oriented along two axes as illustrated inFigure 1. These four directions represent prototypes of dreaming, meaning thedeepest innate oneiric capacities of our species, the primal templates of thishard-wired modality of human brain-mind functioning. In the terms of chaostheory, the prototypes are basins of attraction for the self-organizingemergence of spontaneous psychological order. In spiritual terms, they aremanifestations of the divine and the demonic in human life.The concentric circles indicate the extent of a dream’s intensity, memorability,and impact on the individual. At the center are dreams that possess insufficientstrength to cross the memory threshold, that is, dreams never rising to thelevel of waking awareness. Most of what passes through the mind during eachnight’s sleep is forgotten in this sense. Close to the center are “littledreams” relating to the ordinary, mundane concerns of daily life. Such dreams dolittle more than reflect the current physical and emotional conditions of theindividual. Preoccupied with ordinary daily concerns, they have no deepersignificance and are usually forgotten soon after waking.The wider the circle in the diagram, the greater the dream’s intensity and themore likely it will be remembered upon awakening. Farther from the center of thediagram are dreams that, though less frequent, are extremely memorable andimpactful when they do occur. With physically arousing surges of raw emotion(both positive and negative), amazing visual imagery, feelings of intenserealism, or striking interactions with powerful beings, these “big dreams” havethe tangible effect of expanding the individual’s range of imaginativeunderstanding and religious sensitivity.2 [notes.html#concfn2] The widest circleof the diagram stands for the boundaries of sleep itself, which some dreamsoverleap in the form of psychophysiological carryover effects into wakingawareness.The horizontal line represents the relational axis, expressing the quality andfeeling tone of the dreamer’s relationship with other characters. On the leftend of the relational axis are aggressive dreams, including dreams of beingchased, attacked, or threatened by another character (e.g., another person, ananimal, a spiritual being). Sometimes the dreamer is acting aggressively towardother characters, but the most intense manifestations of this prototype aregenerally nightmares of being on the receiving end of aggression, with painfulfeelings of helplessness in the face of extreme danger from malevolentantagonists. I believe such dreams reflect the deep biological imperative in allspecies to stay alive, to protect oneself against attack and avoid becoming someother creature’s prey.At the other end of the relational axis, sexual dreams reflect an equally urgentbiological imperative, to reproduce and spread our progeny as far and wide aspossible. The dreams that develop in this direction include not only experiencesof vivid and physically arousing sexual encounters but also powerful dreamsrelating to pregnancy, birth, and the care of children. The widespreadprevalence of these kinds of dreams suggests that they, too, are hard-wired intous as a way of priming the human reproductive system, stimulating our positiverelational desires, and guiding us in the process of creating new life.The vertical line represents the elemental axis, showing the extent to which adream is characterized by increasing complexity and structure (low entropy) orfragmentation and decay (high entropy). At the bottom of the axis, gravitationaldreams encompass a host of extremely memorable and almost always unpleasantexperiences such as falling, being paralyzed, being unable to speak, losingone’s teeth or other body parts, watching things fall apart, crashing, becominglost in a void, being swept away by a wave, and so on. Religious versionsinclude images of apocalypse and cosmic cataclysm. The common theme in thesedifferent manifestations of the prototype is the weakness and impotence of thedreamer against gravity and other elemental powers. The individual is threatenednot by another aggressive character but by the inescapable forces of physics. Ibelieve this accurately reflects a fundamental reality of all animate life onearth, namely, that our bodies have developed in response to the planet’sgravitational field. Life on earth is a kind of existential defiance againstgravity, an emergence of self-directed matter rising up to take form and actwith intention. When we die we surrender to gravity as our bodies decay, theirelements dispersing and scattering to the winds. Dreaming is naturallypredisposed to express our cellular awareness of these entropic truths.At the upper end of the elemental axis are mystical dreams. Mystical dreamsexpress the human capacity to envision a transcendental freedom from theoppressive limitations of gravity, entropy, and death. These include flyingdreams, which give the dreamer a vivid physiological experience of beingliberated from the shackles of earthly existence; visitation dreams, in whichthe dreamer encounters deceased loved ones whose living presence defies thefinality of physical death; and healing dreams, which bring tangible relief frommental or physical suffering. Also included here are ecstatic dreams ofbrilliant light and divine union, along with aesthetically creative dreams ofastonishing beauty and cosmic harmony.To recognize and accept the recurrent phenomenon of mystical dreams does notmean abandoning science or pledging faith to some religious creed or dogma.Rather, it means acknowledging the reality of an autonomous visionary capacitywithin the human brain-mind system, a capacity driven by an unconsciousintelligence deeply rooted in our biological nature yet continuously strivingfor transcendent understanding and insight.My hope is that the benefits of this provisional mapping outweigh the inevitabledrawbacks of any system of dream categorization. Many dreams combine two or moreprototypes (e.g., sexual dreams leading to mystical ecstasy or nightmaresincluding aggressive attacks and gravitational misfortunes), and this means thatwe always have to pay attention to such conceptual blendings and theirdistinctive dynamics of significance. I have emphasized the visionary aspects ofdreaming, but some dreams are clearly characterized by intensified sensations ofsound, touch, or movement, and a few include powerful smells and tastes. Themanifestations of each prototype vary greatly in terms of their realism orbizarreness. Some dreams are quite realistic and literal in terms of portrayingfamiliar places, people, and situations, and others are filled with strangeimages and otherworldly realms that deviate radically from the ordinaryconditions of waking life. Metacognitive awareness can emerge in any of theprototypes, though it is too soon to tell whether this represents a separatedevelopmental axis of dreaming. My impression at this point is that manydifferent kinds of metacognitive awareness have the potential to emerge indreams. A more pluralistic approach is required in the exploration of theirdevelopmental possibilities.A major reason why I believe that this fourfold mapping of prototypical dreamsmakes good sense is that each of the prototypes is clearly associated with adistinct kind of carryover effect of dreaming experience into the waking state.With sexual dreams the carry-over is a physical orgasm, of both the male andfemale varieties. With aggressive dreams it is the hyperactivation of thefight/flight response—extreme fear, racing heart, rapid breathing, and full-bodysweat. With gravitational dreams it is the horribly realistic sensation offalling and waking up with a sudden gasping start. With mystical dreams it isthe blissful, ultra-realistic sensation of flying or the profound joy of beingreunited with a deceased loved one. These kinds of direct emotional and bodilycontinuations of the dreaming experience into the person’s waking life areperhaps the strongest and most easily observed instances of the deeply rootedinterplay of dreaming and waking consciousness.Waking impact. The strong carryover effects associated with prototypical dreamsare clues to the specific processes by which dreaming contributes to healthybrain-mind functioning. Aggressive dreams reflect an adaptive concern withidentifying and responding to threats in the waking world. Although emotionallydisturbing, such nightmares have the beneficial effect (in survival terms) ofstimulating greater vigilance toward similar threats in the waking world. Theevolutionary logic is simple: the more often and more intensely one dreams ofvarious kinds of threatening situations, the better prepared one is to reacteffectively to those situations if and when they occur in waking life. Likewisewith gravitational dreams, which accurately reflect and simulate the existentialdangers of entropic destruction. The intense fear and horror generated by thesedreams activates the fundamental instincts of self-preservation that must alwaysbe ready to respond immediately should a comparable danger arise in waking life,whether it is falling from a great height, being involved in a car crash, orlosing physical mobility. Sexual dreams prompt the reproductive system andenvision possible ways of satisfying its desires. Their stimulating andtaboo-defying effect on the erotic imagination is, I suspect, self-evident tomost readers. The impact of mystical dreams is less directly tied toevolutionary biology, and more to the emerging spirit of human creativity.Dreams of the mystical prototype have the effect of enlarging people’s sense oflife’s possibilities, expanding their awareness from a narrow fixation on whatis to a broader consideration of what might be. Such dreams stretch the mind bypushing it to become more conscious of its own powers and the realities thatextend beyond what is immediately present in normal perceptions of the wakingworld.Another kind of significant waking-world impact can be discerned in an unlikelyplace: rationalist skepticism. Voices of critical questioning and naturalisticanalysis have arisen wherever and whenever humans have explored their dreams. Itmight be a surprise to those who assume that modern scientists were the first toexplain dreaming as the mental byproducts of sleep, but many ancient traditionsrecognized exactly the same psychophysiological dynamics at work in people’sdreams. The skeptical perspective did not come after the religious perspective,nor even before it. Historically the two approaches are not mutually exclusive.They have coexisted from the start. The prototypical experiences of dreaminghave provoked not only religious and spiritual experience but also a deeplyhuman capacity for rational thought and critical reflection. Dreams havestimulated the power of reason to become increasingly aware of deceptiveappearances, hidden connections, subtle perceptions, and cognitively impactfulemotions. The biography of Rene Descartes, the seventeenth-century French sagewhose writings sparked the rationalizing explosion of the EuropeanEnlightenment, offers a good example of this dream-inspired process ofphilosophical discovery.3 [notes.html#concfn3]The healing impact of dreaming has been noted in many different religioustraditions, closely associated with spiritual experience but also occurringindependently in the context of local medical practices. In this regard themodern West is unusual in the way it excludes dreams from its mainstream healingsystems. Present-day medical doctors have virtually no interest in dreaming as apotential source of diagnostic insight or curative power, and a surprisinglysmall number of contemporary psychiatrists make the effort to look into theirclients’ dreams for help or guidance. This is especially disappointing fromprofessionals whose symbol is the caduceus, a serpent-entwined staff honored byits association with Asclepius. It is my hope that future researchers willrevive the long-neglected process of exploring, and learning from, the complexinteraction of illness, dreaming, and healing. The simplest way to start thisresearch is by looking at the diagnostic potentials of dreaming as an internallydirected form of anticipatory threat simulation. Further clues to a deeperunderstanding of the healing impact of dreams include the curative power ofintensified personal bonding, the natural activation of the immune system duringsleep, and the healing forces of belief that are too quickly dismissed as“placebo effects.” None of this requires a religious or spiritual worldview toappreciate. Indeed, rationalist skeptics themselves emphasize this very point,that dreams are the psychological manifestations of underlying physiologicalconditions in the body of the sleeping individual. If that is indeed true, thenWestern scientists have only just begun the process of exploring their medicalsignificance.Interpretations. Three different approaches to the interpretation of dreams havebeen practiced in most religious traditions: literal, metaphorical, andparadoxical. The literal approach takes a dream as a direct portrayal ofsomething that is actually happening, or will happen, in the dreamer’s wakinglife. The meaning of the dream is self-evident to the individual and requires noadditional interpretation. The metaphorical approach is more expansive, and moreelusive. It considers a dream as an indirect expression of valuable meaningsthat can be interpreted and understood through the intuitive analysis of signs,symbols, analogies, and allegories. The same metaphor-making powers of cognitionthat produce language, culture, and artistic creativity in waking life are alsoactive in sleep and dreaming, and the challenge for the interpreter (whether thedreamer or someone else) is to discover the strongest and most usefulmetaphorical connections between the dream and the individual’s waking life.Traditions using the metaphorical approach have generally recognized thatinterpretation always depends on the personal circumstances of the dreamer. Thesame dream can mean different things for different people, and every symbol hasmultiple dimensions of significance. A metaphorical interpretation is tested andjudged by its coherence, plausibility, gut-level intuitive response (the “aha”experience), and pragmatic fruits in waking life.Paradoxical interpretations involve a direct reversal of the dream’s imagery, sothat a dream of one event means that the opposite will occur in waking life.This is the most suspicious type of interpretation from a skeptic’s perspective,and the preceding chapters have illustrated the all-too-human temptation tomanipulate the interpretation of other people’s dreams in order to control thosepeople more effectively and promote one’s own personal power. That said, I donot rule out the possibility of a genuinely paradoxical dimension of dreaming,given that binary processes are central to many brain-mind functions, and binarysymbols and themes are pervasive throughout the world’s religious andmythological systems.Dream incubation is the general term for all the various kinds of pre-sleeprituals and prayers whose aim is to create a heightened context for thereception of clear, vivid, meaningful dreams. Each religious tradition’s versionof dream incubation is oriented toward its own most powerful spiritual figures,and the different practices (e.g., special places to sleep, clothes to wear,furs to lie on, foods to eat or not eat, bodily postures to use, words to praywhile drifting off, etc.) have the cumulative effect of separating people fromthe ordinary realities of their waking lives and bringing them closer towhatever it is they consider sacred or divine. The purposes of dream incubationhave ranged widely, from healing and prophecy to romance and hunting. A fewtraditions have taught that people can achieve so much self-awareness andcontrol within sleep that they transcend dreaming entirely and dwell within apure state of empty consciousness. In actual practice, most religions havelooked to dream incubation for assistance with urgent problems in daily life.The pre-sleep rituals and prayers are motivated by a need for new energy andcreative insight to help people transform their waking realities.Along with efforts to incubate positive dreams, most traditions have alsoemployed various methods of fending off negative dreams such as nightmares andnight terrors. These practices reflect the vulnerability humans have always feltwhen sleeping and their desire for as much protection as possible from spiritualdanger and demonic attack. In a few cases, religious and political authoritieshave declared that all dreams are dangerous and have ordered people to ignorethem. This has been an effective means of one group establishing dominance overanother, since it directly breaks the weaker people’s experiential connection totheir spiritual traditions, rendering them more pliant subjects for theideological control of the stronger group.The rise of modern industrial civilization, with its mechanized timekeepingdevices, darkness-banishing electric lights, and increasingly dense urbanpopulations, has produced dramatic changes in the waking and sleeping patternsof the human race. For the past century, people in modern industrial societieshave been sleeping less than in the past, with greater variations in their hoursof wakefulness and more abrupt arousals out of sleep (i.e., by the ring of analarm clock). The impact of mass media such as films, television, music, andvideo games on the modern experience of sleeping and dreaming has also beenconsiderable. Environmental problems such as climate change, toxic pollution,deforestation, and species extinction may also shape certain trends in people’sdreaming today insofar as such factors reflect troubling changes in the naturalworld that pose potentially catastrophic dangers to human survival.The question of what is distinctive and new in the dreaming experiences ofhumans living today, in the early years of the twenty-first century, is a storythat begins where this book ends.DREAM BOOKSAn impulse to write about dreams has arisen in the earliest eras of mostliterate civilizations. We have encountered numerous examples of the dream bookgenre in a variety of religious traditions, from the Hindu Atharva Veda toArtemidorus’s Oneirocritica, from the Egyptian Ramesside Dream Book to ZhangFengyi’s Meng-chan lei-k’so. Although appearing in quite different culturalcontexts, these books share several basic insights about the prototypical formsof human dream experience. The authors are frequently motivated to write bytheir own dreams, and their works aim to provide a systematic overview of theircivilization’s current knowledge of dreams. Of course, many of the interpretivesubtleties of these books are lost in the translation to modern English. Themeanings are so closely related to the particular details of the individual’swaking life that we today will never be able to fully grasp the metaphoricalconnections identified in the ancient books. But certain aspects of the dreamingexperience survive the passage through history and across language, aspects thatwe recognize in the findings of contemporary scientific research and in our owndreams. Many of the books make their final appeal to the reader’s personal sleepand dream experiences as the only reliable way to evaluate the author’s claims.And that, too, is how this dream book will close."},{"pageContent":"NOTESNOTES TO THE INTRODUCTION1.
