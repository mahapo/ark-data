Mysticism and monasticism enveloped; the arts remained ill princi-ple within the limits of iconodasm but escaped rational umjdification in every w\\jy. Owing to the nJatively small part played by internal violence, Islam was even the most stable of the differeni economies of salvation, the one that best ensured the stability of a societv.
