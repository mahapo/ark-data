[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE GOLDEN BOUGHBY SIR JAMES GEORGE FRAZER1922PREFACETHE primary aim of this book is to explain the remarkable rule which regulated the succes-sion to the priesthood of Diana at Aricia. When I first set myself to solve the problem morehthan thirty years ago, I thought that the solution could be propounded very briefly, but I soonfound that to render it probable or even intelligible it was necessary to discuss certain moregeneral questions, some of which had hardly been broached before. In successive editionsthe discussion of these and kindred topics has occupied more and more space, the enquiryhas branched out in more and more directions, until the two volumes of the original workhave expanded into twelve. Meantime a wish has often been expressed that the book shouldbe issued in a more compendious form. This abridgment is an attempt to meet the wish andthereby to bring the work within the range of a wider circle of readers. While the bulk of thebook has been greatly reduced, I have endeavoured to retain its leading principles, togetherwith an amount of evidence sufficient to illustrate them clearly. The language of the originalhas also for the most part been preserved, though here and there the exposition has beensomewhat condesed. In order to keep as much of the text as possible I have sacrificed all thenotes, and with them all exact reference to my authorities. Readers who desire to ascertainthe source of any particular statement must therefore consult the larger work, which is fullydocumented and provided with a complete bibliography.In the abridgment I have neither added new matter nor altered the views expressed in the lastedition; for the evidence which has come to my knowledge in the meantime has on the wholeserved either to confirm my former conclusions or to furnish fresh illustrations of old princi-ples. Thus, for example, on the crucial question of the practice of putting kings to death eitherat the end of a fixed period or whenever their health and strength began to fail, the body ofevidence which points to the wide prevalence of such a custom has been considerably aug-mented in the interval. A striking instance of a limited monarchy of this sort is furnished by thepowerful mediaeval kingdom of the Khazars in Southern Russia, where the kings were liableto be put to death either on the expiry of a set of terms or whenever some public calamity,such as drought, dearth, or defeat in war, seemed to indicate a failure of their natural powers.The evidence for the systematic killing of Khazar kings, drawn from the accounts of old Arabtravellers, has been collected by me elsewhere. Africa, again, has supplied several freshexamples of a similar practice of regicide. Among them the most notable perhaps is the cus-tom formerly observed in Bunyoro of choosing every year from a particular clan a mock king,who was supposed to incarnate the late king, cohabited with his widows at his temple-tomb,and after reigning for a week was strangled. The custom presents a close parallel to theancient Babylonian festival of the Sacaea, at which a mock king was dressed in the royalrobes, allowed to enjoy the real king’s concubines, and after reigning for five days wasstripped, scourged, and put to death. The festival in its turn has lately received fresh lightfrom certain Assyrian inscriptions, which seem to confirm the interpretation which I formerlygave of the festival as a New Year celebration and the parent of the Jewish festival of Purim.Other recently discovered parallels to the priestly kings of Aricia are African priests and kingswho used to be put to death at the end of seven or of two years, after being liable in the inter-Page 1"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"val to be attacked and killed by a strong man, who thereupon succeeded to the priesthood orthe kingdom.With these and other instances of like customs before us it is no longer possible to regard therule of succession to the priesthood of Diana at Aricia as exceptional; it clearly exemplifies awidespread institution, of which the most numerous and the most similar cases have thus farbeen found in Africa. How far the facts point to an early influence of Africa on Italy, or even tothe existence of an African population in Southern Europe, I do not presume to say. The pre-historic relations between the two continents are still obscure and still under investigation.Whether the explanation which I have offered of the institution is correct or not must be left tothe future to determine. I shall always be ready to abandon it if a better can be suggested.Meantime in committing the book in its new form to the judgment of the public I desire toguard against a misapprehension of its scope which appears to be still rife, though I havesought to correct it before now. If in the present work I have dwelt at some length on the wor-ship of trees, it is not, I trust, because I exaggerate its importance in the history of religion,still less because I would deduce from it a whole system of mythology; it is simply because Icould not ignore the subject in attempting to explain the significance of a priest who bore thetitle of King of the Wood, and one of whose titles to office was the plucking of a bough—theGolden Bough—from a tree in the sacred grove. But I am so far from regarding the reverencefor trees as of supreme importance for the evolution of religion that I consider it to have beenaltogether subordinate to other factors, and in particular to the fear of the human dead, which,on the whole, I believe to have been probably the most powerful force in the making of primi-tive religion. I hope that after this explicit disclaimer I shall no longer be taxed with embracinga system of mythology which I look upon not merely as false but as preposterous and absurd.But I am too familiar with the hydra of error that by lopping off one of the monster’s heads Ican prevent another, or even the same, from sprouting again. I can only trust to the candourand intelligence of my readers to rectify this serious misconception of my views by a compari-son with my own express declaration.J.G.

DIANA AND VIRBIUSWHO does not know Turner’s picture of the Golden Bough? The scene, suffused with thegolden glow of imagination in which the divine mind of Turner steeped and transfigured eventhe fairest natural landscape, is a dream-like vision of the little woodland lake of Nemi—”Diana’s Mirror,” as it was called by the ancients. No one who has seen that calm water,lapped in a green hollow of the Alban hills, can ever forget it. The two characteristic Italian vil-lages which slumber on its banks, and the equally Italian palace whose terraced gardensdescend steeply to the lake, hardly break the stillness and even the solitariness of the scene.Diana herself might still linger by this lonely shore, still haunt these woodlands wild. In antiquity this sylvan landscape was the scene of a strange and recurring tragedy. On thenorthern shore of the lake, right under the precipitous cliffs on which the modern village ofNemi is perched, stood the sacred grove and sanctuary of Diana Nemorensis, or Diana of theWood. The lake and the grove were sometimes known as the lake and grove of Aricia. Butthe town of Aricia (the modern La Riccia) was situated about three miles off, at the foot of theAlban Mount, and separated by a steep descent from the lake, which lies in a small crater-likehollow on the mountain side. In this sacred grove there grew a certain tree round which atany time of the day, and probably far into the night, a grim figure might be seen to prowl. Inhis hand he carried a drawn sword, and he kept peering warily about him as if at everyinstant he expected to be set upon by an enemy. He was a priest and a murderer; and theman for whom he looked was sooner or later to murder him and hold the priesthood in hisstead. Such was the rule of the sanctuary. A candidate for the priesthood could only succeedto office by slaying the priest, and having slain him, he retained office till he was himself slainby a stronger or a craftier. The post which he held by this precarious tenure carried with it the title of king; but surely nocrowned head ever lay uneasier, or was visited by more evil dreams, than his. For year in,year out, in summer and winter, in fair weather and in foul, he had to keep his lonely watch,and whenever he snatched a troubled slumber it was at the peril of his life. The least relax-ation of his vigilance, the smallest abatement of his strength of limb or skill of fence, put himin jeopardy; grey hairs might seal his death-warrant. To gentle and pious pilgrims at the shrinethe sight of him might well seem to darken the fair landscape, as when a cloud suddenly blotsthe sun on a bright day. The dreamy blue of Italian skies, the dappled shade of summerwoods, and the sparkle of waves in the sun, can have accorded but ill with that stern and sin-ister figure. Rather we picture to ourselves the scene as it may have been witnessed by abelated wayfarer on one of those wild autumn nights when the dead leaves are falling thick,and the winds seem to sing the dirge of the dying year. It is a sombre picture, set to melan-choly music—the background of forest showing black and jagged against a lowering andstormy sky, the sighing of the wind in the branches, the rustle of the withered leaves underfoot, the lapping of the cold water on the shore, and in the foreground, pacing to and fro, nowin twilight and now in gloom, a dark figure with a glitter of steel at the shoulder whenever thepale moon, riding clear of the cloud-rack, peers down at him through the matted boughs. The strange rule of this priesthood has no parallel in classical antiquity, and cannot beexplained from it. To find an explanation we must go farther afield. No one will probably denythat such a custom savours of a barbarous age, and, surviving into imperial times, stands outPage 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"in striking isolation from the polished Italian society of the day, like a primaeval rock risingfrom a smooth-shaven lawn. It is the very rudeness and barbarity of the custom which allowus a hope of explaining it. For recent researches into the early history of man have revealedthe essential similarity with which, under many superficial differences, the human mind haselaborated its first crude philosophy of life. Accordingly, if we can show that a barbarous cus-tom, like that of the priesthood of Nemi, has existed elsewhere; if we can detect the motiveswhich led to its institution; if we can prove that these motives have operated widely, perhapsuniversally, in human society, producing in varied circumstances a variety of institutionsspecifically different but generically alike; if we can show, lastly, that these very motives, withsome of their derivative institutions, were actually at work in classical antiquity; then we mayfairly infer that at a remoter age the same motives gave birth to the priesthood of Nemi. Suchan inference, in default of direct evidence as to how the priesthood did actually arise, cannever amount to demonstration. But it will be more or less probable according to the degreeof completeness with which it fulfils the conditions I have indicated. The object of this book is,by meeting these conditions, to offer a fairly probable explanation of the priesthood of Nemi.I begin by setting forth the few facts and legends which have come down to us on the sub-ject. According to one story the worship of Diana at Nemi was instituted by Orestes, who,after killing Thoas, King of the Tauric Chersonese (the Crimea), fled with his sister to Italy,bringing with him the image of the Tauric Diana hidden in a faggot of sticks. After his deathhis bones were transported from Aricia to Rome and buried in front of the temple of Saturn,on the Capitoline slope, beside the temple of Concord. The bloody ritual which legendascribed to the Tauric Diana is familiar to classical readers; it is said that every stranger wholanded on the shore was sacrificed on her altar. But transported to Italy, the rite assumed amilder form. Within the sanctuary at Nemi grew a certain tree of which no branch might bebroken. Only a runaway slave was allowed to break off, if he could, one of its boughs.Success in the attempt entitled him to fight the priest in single combat, and if he slew him hereigned in his stead with the title of King of the Wood (Rex Nemorensis). According to thepublic opinion of the ancients the fateful branch was that Golden Bough which, at the Sibyl’sbidding, Aeneas plucked before he essayed the perilous journey to the world of the dead. Theflight of the slave represented, it was said, the flight of Orestes; his combat with the priestwas a reminiscence of the human sacrifices once offered to the Tauric Diana. This rule ofsuccession by the sword was observed down to imperial times; for amongst his other freaksCaligula, thinking that the priest of Nemi had held office too long, hired a more stalwart ruffianto slay him; and a Greek traveller, who visited Italy in the age of the Antonines, remarks thatdown to his time the priesthood was still the prize of victory in a single combat. Of the worship of Diana at Nemi some leading features can still be made out. From the votiveofferings which have been found on the site, it appears that she was conceived of especiallyas a huntress, and further as blessing men and women with offspring, and granting expectantmothers an easy delivery. Again, fire seems to have played a foremost part in her ritual. Forduring her annual festival, held on the thirteenth of August, at the hottest time of the year, hergrove shone with a multitude of torches, whose ruddy glare was reflected by the lake; andthroughout the length and breadth of Italy the day was kept with holy rites at every domestichearth. Bronze statuettes found in her precinct represent the goddess herself holding a torchin her raised right hand; and women whose prayers had been heard by her came crownedwith wreaths and bearing lighted torches to the sanctuary in fulfilment of their vows. Someone unknown dedicated a perpetually burning lamp in a little shrine at Nemi for the safety ofthe Emperor Claudius and his family. The terra-cotta lamps which have been discovered inthe grove may perhaps have served a like purpose for humbler persons. If so, the analogy ofPage 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the custom to the Catholic practice of dedicating holy candles in churches would be obvious.Further, the title of Vesta borne by Diana at Nemi points clearly to the maintenance of a per-petual holy fire in her sanctuary. A large circular basement at the north-east corner of the tem-ple, raised on three steps and bearing traces of a mosaic pavement, probably supported around temple of Diana in her character of Vesta, like the round temple of Vesta in the RomanForum. Here the sacred fire would seem to have been tended by Vestal Virgins, for the headof a Vestal in terra-cotta was found on the spot, and the worship of a perpetual fire, cared forby holy maidens, appears to have been common in Latium from the earliest to the latesttimes. Further, at the annual festival of the goddess, hunting dogs were crowned and wildbeasts were not molested; young people went through a purificatory ceremony in her honour;wine was brought forth, and the feast consisted of a kid, cakes served piping hot on plates ofleaves, and apples still hanging in clusters on the boughs.But Diana did not reign alone in her grove at Nemi. Two lesser divinities shared her forestsanctuary. One was Egeria, the nymph of the clear water which, bubbling from the basalticrocks, used to fall in graceful cascades into the lake at the place called Le Mole, becausehere were established the mills of the modern village of Nemi. The purling of the stream as itran over the pebbles is mentioned by Ovid, who tells us that he had often drunk of its water.Women with child used to sacrifice to Egeria, because she was believed, like Diana, to beable to grant them an easy delivery. Tradition ran that the nymph had been the wife or mis-tress of the wise king Numa, that he had consorted with her in the secrecy of the sacredgrove, and that the laws which he gave the Romans had been inspired by communion withher divinity. Plutarch compares the legend with other tales of the loves of goddesses for mor-tal men, such as the love of Cybele and the Moon for the fair youths Attis and Endymion.According to some, the trysting-place of the lovers was not in the woods of Nemi but in agrove outside the dripping Porta Capena at Rome, where another sacred spring of Egeriagushed from a dark cavern. Every day the Roman Vestals fetched water from this spring towash the temple of Vesta, carrying it in earthenware pitchers on their heads. In Juvenal’s timethe natural rock had been encased in marble, and the hallowed spot was profaned by gangsof poor Jews, who were suffered to squat, like gypsies, in the grove. We may suppose thatthe spring which fell into the lake of Nemi was the true original Egeria, and that when the firstsettlers moved down from the Alban hills to the banks of the Tiber they brought the nymphwith them and found a new home for her in a grove outside the gates. The remains of bathswhich have been discovered within the sacred precinct, together with many terra-cotta mod-els of various parts of the human body, suggest that the waters of Egeria were used to healthe sick, who may have signified their hopes or testified their gratitude by dedicating likeness-es of the diseased members to the goddess, in accordance with a custom which is stillobserved in many parts of Europe. To this day it would seem that the spring retains medicinalvirtues.The other of the minor deities at Nemi was Virbius. Legend had it that Virbius was the youngGreek hero Hippolytus, chaste and fair, who learned the art of venery from the centaurChiron, and spent all his days in the greenwood chasing wild beasts with the virgin huntressArtemis (the Greek counterpart of Diana) for his only comrade. Proud of her divine society, hespurned the love of women, and this proved his bane. For Aphrodite, stung by his scorn,inspired his stepmother Phaedra with love of him; and when he disdained her wickedadvances she falsely accused him to his father Theseus. The slander was believed, andTheseus prayed to his sire Poseidon to avenge the imagined wrong. So while Hippolytusdrove in a chariot by the shore of the Saronic Gulf, the sea-god sent a fierce bull forth fromthe waves. The terrified horses bolted, threw Hippolytus from the chariot, and dragged him atPage 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"their hoofs to death. But Diana, for the love she bore Hippolytus, persuaded the leechAesculapius to bring her fair young hunter back to life by his simples. Jupiter, indignant that amortal man should return from the gates of death, thrust down the meddling leech himself toHades. But Diana hid her favourite from the angry god in a thick cloud, disguised his featuresby adding years to his life, and then bore him far away to the dells of Nemi, where sheentrusted him to the nymph Egeria, to live there, unknown and solitary, under the name ofVirbius, in the depth of the Italian forest. There he reigned a king, and there he dedicated aprecinct to Diana. He had a comely son, Virbius, who, undaunted by his father’s fate, drove ateam of fiery steeds to join the Latins in the war against Aeneas and the Trojans. Virbius wasworshipped as a god not only at Nemi but elsewhere; for in Campania we hear of a specialpriest devoted to his service. Horses were excluded from the Arician grove and sanctuarybecause horses had killed Hippolytus. It was unlawful to touch his image. Some thought thathe was the sun. “But the truth is,” says Servius, “that he is a deity associated with Diana, asAttis is associated with the Mother of the Gods, and Erichthonius with Minerva, and Adoniswith Venus.” What the nature of that association was we shall enquire presently. Here it isworth observing that in his long and chequered career this mythical personage has displayeda remarkable tenacity of life. For we can hardly doubt that the Saint Hippolytus of the Romancalendar, who was dragged by horses to death on the thirteenth of August, Diana’s own day,is no other than the Greek hero of the same name, who, after dying twice over as a heathensinner, has been happily resuscitated as a Christian saint.It needs no elaborate demonstration to convince us that the stories told to account for Diana’sworship at Nemi are unhistorical. Clearly they belong to that large class of myths which aremade up to explain the origin of a religious ritual and have no other foundation than theresemblance, real or imaginary, which may be traced between it and some foreign ritual. Theincongruity of these Nemi myths is indeed transparent, since the foundation of the worship istraced now to Orestes and now to Hippolytus, according as this or that feature of the ritualhas to be accounted for. The real value of such tales is that they serve to illustrate the natureof the worship by providing a standard with which to compare it; and further, that they bearwitness indirectly to its venerable age by showing that the true origin was lost in the mists ofa fabulous antiquity. In the latter respect these Nemi legends are probably more to be trustedthan the apparently historical tradition, vouched for by Cato the Elder, that the sacred grovewas dedicated to Diana by a certain Egerius Baebius or Laevius of Tusculum, a Latin dictator,on behalf of the peoples of Tusculum, Aricia, Lanuvium, Laurentum, Cora, Tibur, Pometia, andArdea. This tradition indeed speaks for the great age of the sanctuary, since it seems to dateits foundation sometime before 495 B.C., the year in which Pometia was sacked by theRomans and disappears from history. But we cannot suppose that so barbarous a rule as thatof the Arician priesthood was deliberately instituted by a league of civilised communities, suchas the Latin cities undoubtedly were. It must have been handed down from a time beyond thememory of man, when Italy was still in a far ruder state than any known to us in the historicalperiod. The credit of the tradition is rather shaken than confirmed by another story whichascribes the foundation of the sanctuary to a certain Manius Egerius, who gave rise to thesaying, “There are many Manii at Aricia.” This proverb some explained by alleging thatManius Egerius was the ancestor of a long and distinguished line, whereas others thought itmeant that there were many ugly and deformed people at Aricia, and they derived the nameManius from Mania, a bogey or bugbear to frighten children. A Roman satirist uses the nameManius as typical of the beggars who lay in wait for pilgrims on the Arician slopes. These dif-ferences of opinion, together with the discrepancy between Manius Egerius of Aricia andEgerius Laevius of Tusculum, as well as the resemblance of both names to the mythicalEgeria, excite our suspicion. Yet the tradition recorded by Cato seems too circumstantial, andPage 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"its sponsor too respectable, to allow us to dismiss it as an idle fiction. Rather we may sup-pose that it refers to some ancient restoration or reconstruction of the sanctuary, which wasactually carried out by the confederate states. At any rate it testifies to a belief that the grovehad been from early times a common place of worship for many of the oldest cities of thecountry, if not for the whole Latin confederacy.2. ARTEMIS AND HIPPOLYTUSI have said that the Arician legends of Orestes and Hippolytus, though worthless as history,have a certain value in so far as they may help us to understand the worship at Nemi betterby comparing it with the ritual and myths of other sanctuaries. We must ask ourselves, Whydid the author of these legends pitch upon Orestes and Hippolytus in order to explain Virbiusand the King of the Wood? In regard to Orestes, the answer is obvious. He and the image ofthe Tauric Diana, which could only be appeased with human blood, were dragged in to renderintelligible the murderous rule of succession to the Arician priesthood. In regard to Hippolytusthe case is not so plain. The manner of his death suggests readily enough a reason for theexclusion of horses from the grove; but this by itself seems hardly enough to account for theidentification. We must try to probe deeper by examining the worship as well as the legend ormyth of Hippolytus. He had a famous sanctuary at his ancestral home of Troezen, situated on that beautiful,almost landlocked bay, where groves of oranges and lemons, with tall cypresses soaring likedark spires above the garden of Hesperides, now clothe the strip of fertile shore at the foot ofthe rugged mountains. Across the blue water of the tranquil bay, which it shelters from theopen sea, rises Poseidon’s sacred island, its peaks veiled in the sombre green of the pines.On this fair coast Hippolytus was worshipped. Within his sanctuary stood a temple with anancient image. His service was performed by a priest who held office for life; every year asacrificial festival was held in his honour; and his untimely fate was yearly mourned, withweeping and doleful chants, by unwedded maids. Youths and maidens dedicated locks oftheir hair in his temple before marriage. His grave existed at Troezen, though the peoplewould not show it. It has been suggested, with great plausibility, that in the handsomeHippolytus, beloved of Artemis, cut off in his youthful prime, and yearly mourned by damsels,we have one of those mortal lovers of a goddess who appear so often in ancient religion, andof whom Adonis is the most familiar type. The rivalry of Artemis and Phaedra for the affectionof Hippolytus reproduces, it is said, under different names, the rivalry of Aphrodite andProserpine for the love of Adonis, for Phaedra is merely a double of Aphrodite. The theoryprobably does no injustice either to Hippolytus or to Artemis. For Artemis was originally agreat goddess of fertility, and, on the principles of early religion, she who fertilises naturemust herself be fertile, and to be that she must necessarily have a male consort. On this view,Hippolytus was the consort of Artemis at Troezen, and the shorn tresses offered to him by theTroezenian youths and maidens before marriage were designed to strengthen his union withthe goddess, and so to promote the fruitfulness of the earth, of cattle, and of mankind. It issome confirmation of this view that within the precinct of Hippolytus at Troezen there wereworshipped two female powers named Damia and Auxesia, whose connexion with the fertilityof the ground is unquestionable. When Epidaurus suffered from a dearth, the people, in obe-dience to an oracle, carved images of Damia and Auxesia out of sacred olive wood, and nosooner had they done so and set them up than the earth bore fruit again. Moreover, atTroezen itself, and apparently within the precinct of Hippolytus, a curious festival of stone-throwing was held in honour of these maidens, as the Troezenians called them; and it is easyto show that similar customs have been practised in many lands for the express purpose ofPage 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ensuring good crops. In the story of the tragic death of the youthful Hippolytus we may dis-cern an analogy with similar tales of other fair but mortal youths who paid with their lives forthe brief rapture of the love of an immortal goddess. These hapless lovers were probably notalways mere myths, and the legends which traced their spilt blood in the purple bloom of theviolet, the scarlet stain of the anemone, or the crimson flush of the rose were no idle poeticemblems of youth and beauty fleeting as the summer flowers. Such fables contain a deeperphilosophy of the relation of the life of man to the life of nature—a sad philosophy which gavebirth to a tragic practice. What that philosophy and that practice were, we shall learn later on.3. RECAPITULATIONWe can now perhaps understand why the ancients identified Hippolytus, the consort ofArtemis, with Virbius, who, according to Servius, stood to Diana as Adonis to Venus, or Attisto the Mother of the Gods. For Diana, like Artemis, was a goddess of fertility in general, andof childbirth in particular. As such she, like her Greek counterpart, needed a male partner.That partner, if Servius is right, was Virbius. In his character of the founder of the sacredgrove and first king of Nemi, Virbius is clearly the mythical predecessor or archetype of theline of priests who served Diana under the title of Kings of the Wood, and who came, like him,one after the other, to a violent end. It is natural, therefore, to conjecture that they stood tothe goddess of the grove in the same relation in which Virbius stood to her; in short, that themortal King of the Wood had for his queen the woodland Diana herself. If the sacred treewhich he guarded with his life was supposed, as seems probable, to be her special embodi-ment, her priest may not only have worshipped it as his goddess but embraced it as his wife.There is at least nothing absurd in the supposition, since even in the time of Pliny a nobleRoman used thus to treat a beautiful beech-tree in another sacred grove of Diana on theAlban hills. He embraced it, he kissed it, he lay under its shadow, he poured wine on its trunk.Apparently he took the tree for the goddess. The custom of physically marrying men andwomen to trees is still practised in India and other parts of the East. Why should it not haveobtained in ancient Latium? Reviewing the evidence as a whole, we may conclude that the worship of Diana in her sacredgrove at Nemi was of great importance and immemorial antiquity; that she was revered as thegoddess of woodlands and of wild creatures, probably also of domestic cattle and of the fruitsof the earth; that she was believed to bless men and women with offspring and to aid mothersin childbed; that her holy fire, tended by chaste virgins, burned perpetually in a round templewithin the precinct; that associated with her was a water-nymph Egeria who discharged oneof Diana’s own functions by succouring women in travail, and who was popularly supposed tohave mated with an old Roman king in the sacred grove; further, that Diana of the Wood her-self had a male companion Virbius by name, who was to her what Adonis was to Venus, orAttis to Cybele; and, lastly, that this mythical Virbius was represented in historical times by aline of priests known as Kings of the Wood, who regularly perished by the swords of theirsuccessors, and whose lives were in a manner bound up with a certain tree in the grove,because so long as that tree was uninjured they were safe from attack.Clearly these conclusions do not of themselves suffice to explain the peculiar rule of succes-sion to the priesthood. But perhaps the survey of a wider field may lead us to think that theycontain in germ the solution of the problem. To that wider survey we must now address our-selves. It will be long and laborious, but may possess something of the interest and charm ofa voyage of discovery, in which we shall visit many strange foreign lands, with strange foreignPage 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"peoples, and still stranger customs. The wind is in the shrouds: we shake out our sails to it,and leave the coast of Italy behind us for a time.Chapter IIPriestly KingsTHE questions which we have set ourselves to answer are mainly two: first, why had Diana’spriest at Nemi, the King of the Wood, to slay his predecessor? second, why before doing sohad he to pluck the branch of a certain tree which the public opinion of the ancients identifiedwith Virgil’s Golden Bough?The first point on which we fasten is the priest’s title. Why was he called the King of theWood? Why was his office spoken of as a kingdom?The union of a royal title with priestly duties was common in ancient Italy and Greece. AtRome and in other cities of Latium there was a priest called the Sacrificial King or King of theSacred Rites, and his wife bore the title of Queen of the Sacred Rites. In republican Athensthe second annual magistrate of the state was called the King, and his wife the Queen; thefunctions of both were religious. Many other Greek democracies had titular kings, whoseduties, so far as they are known, seem to have been priestly, and to have centered round theCommon Hearth of the state. Some Greek states had several of these titular kings, who heldoffice simultaneously. At Rome the tradition was that the Sacrificial King had been appointedafter the abolition of the monarchy in order to offer the sacrifices which before had beenoffered by the kings. A similar view as to the origin of the priestly kings appears to have pre-vailed in Greece. In itself the opinion is not improbable, and it is borne out by the example ofSparta, almost the only purely Greek state which retained the kingly form of government inhistorical times. For in Sparta all state sacrifices were offered by the kings as descendants ofthe god. One of the two Spartan kings held the priesthood of Zeus Lacedaemon, the otherthe priesthood of Heavenly Zeus.This combination of priestly functions with royal authority is familiar to every one. Asia Minor,for example, was the seat of various great religious capitals peopled by thousands of sacredslaves, and ruled by pontiffs who wielded at once temporal and spiritual authority, like thepopes of mediaeval Rome. Such priest-ridden cities were Zela and Pessinus. Teutonic kings,again, in the old heathen days seem to have stood in the position, and to have exercised thepowers, of high priests. The Emperors of China offered public sacrifices, the details of whichwere regulated by the ritual books. The King of Madagascar was high-priest of the realm. Atthe great festival of the new year, when a bullock was sacrificed for the good of the kingdom,the king stood over the sacrifice to offer prayer and thanksgiving, while his attendants slaugh-tered the animal. In the monarchical states which still maintain their independence among theGallas of Eastern Africa, the king sacrifices on the mountain tops and regulates the immola-tion of human victims; and the dim light of tradition reveals a similar union of temporal andspiritual power, of royal and priestly duties, in the kings of that delightful region of CentralAmerica whose ancient capital, now buried under the rank growth of the tropical forest, ismarked by the stately and mysterious ruins of Palenque.When we have said that the ancient kings were commonly priests also, we are far from hav-ing exhausted the religious aspect of their office. In those days the divinity that hedges a kingwas no empty form of speech, but the expression of a sober belief. Kings were revered, inPage 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"many cases not merely as priests, that is, as intercessors between man and god, but asthemselves gods, able to bestow upon their subjects and worshippers those blessings whichare commonly supposed to be beyond the reach of mortals, and are sought, if at all, only byprayer and sacrifice offered to superhuman and invisible beings. Thus kings are often expect-ed to give rain and sunshine in due season, to make the crops grow, and so on. Strange asthis expectation appears to us, it is quite of a piece with early modes of thought. A savagehardly conceives the distinction commonly drawn by more advanced peoples between thenatural and the supernatural. To him the world is to a great extent worked by supernaturalagents, that is, by personal beings acting on impulses and motives like his own, liable likehim to be moved by appeals to their pity, their hopes, and their fears. In a world so conceivedhe sees no limit to his power of influencing the course of nature to his own advantage.Prayers, promises, or threats may secure him fine weather and an abundant crop from thegods; and if a god should happen, as he sometimes believes, to become incarnate in his ownperson, then he need appeal to no higher being; he, the savage, possesses in himself all thepowers necessary to further his own well-being and that of his fellow-men. This is one way in which the idea of a man-god is reached. But there is another. Along withthe view of the world as pervaded by spiritual forces, savage man has a different, and proba-bly still older, conception in which we may detect a germ of the modern notion of natural lawor the view of nature as a series of events occurring in an invariable order without the inter-vention of personal agency. The germ of which I speak is involved in that sympathetic magic,as it may be called, which plays a large part in most systems of superstition. In early societythe king is frequently a magician as well as a priest; indeed he appears to have often attainedto power by virtue of his supposed proficiency in the black or white art. Hence in order tounderstand the evolution of the kingship and the sacred character with which the office hascommonly been invested in the eyes of savage or barbarous peoples, it is essential to havesome acquaintance with the principles of magic and to form some conception of the extraordi-nary hold which that ancient system of superstition has had on the human mind in all agesand all countries. Accordingly I propose to consider the subject in some detail.Chapter IIISympathetic Magic1. THE PRINCIPLES OF MAGICIF we analyse the principles of thought on which magic is based, they will probably be foundto resolve themselves into two: first, that like produces like, or that an effect resembles itscause; and, second, that things which have once been in contact with each other continue toact on each other at a distance after the physical contact has been severed. The former prin-ciple may be called the Law of Similarity, the latter the Law of Contact or Contagion. From thefirst of these principles, namely the Law of Similarity, the magician infers that he can produceany effect he desires merely by imitating it: from the second he infers that whatever he doesto a material object will affect equally the person with whom the object was once in contact,whether it formed part of his body or not. Charms based on the Law of Similarity may becalled Homoeopathic or Imitative Magic. Charms based on the Law of Contact or Contagionmay be called Contagious Magic. To denote the first of these branches of magic the termHomoeopathic is perhaps preferable, for the alternative term Imitative or Mimetic suggests, ifit does not imply, a conscious agent who imitates, thereby limiting the scope of magic too nar-rowly. For the same principles which the magician applies in the practice of his art are implic-itly believed by him to regulate the operations of inanimate nature; in other words, he tacitlyPage 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"assumes that the Laws of Similarity and Contact are of universal application and are not limit-ed to human actions. In short, magic is a spurious system of natural law as well as a falla-cious guide of conduct; it is a false science as well as an abortive art. Regarded as a systemof natural law, that is, as a statement of the rules which determine the sequence of eventsthroughout the world, it may be called Theoretical Magic: regarded as a set of precepts whichhuman beings observe in order to compass their ends, it may be called Practical Magic. Atthe same time it is to be borne in mind that the primitive magician knows magic only on itspractical side; he never analyses the mental processes on which his practice is based, neverreflects on the abstract principles involved in his actions. With him, as with the vast majorityof men, logic is implicit, not explicit: he reasons just as he digests his food in complete igno-rance of the intellectual and physiological processes which are essential to the one operationand to the other. In short, to him magic is always an art, never a science; the very idea of sci-ence is lacking in his undeveloped mind. It is for the philosophic student to trace the train ofthought which underlies the magician’s practice; to draw out the few simple threads of whichthe tangled skein is composed; to disengage the abstract principles from their concrete appli-cations; in short, to discern the spurious science behind the bastard art.If my analysis of the magician’s logic is correct, its two great principles turn out to be merelytwo different misapplications of the association of ideas. Homoeopathic magic is founded onthe association of ideas by similarity: contagious magic is founded on the association of ideasby contiguity. Homoeopathic magic commits the mistake of assuming that things whichresemble each other are the same: contagious magic commits the mistake of assuming thatthings which have once been in contact with each other are always in contact. But in practicethe two branches are often combined; or, to be more exact, while homoeopathic or imitativemagic may be practised by itself, contagious magic will generally be found to involve an appli-cation of the homoeopathic or imitative principle. Thus generally stated the two things may bea little difficult to grasp, but they will readily become intelligible when they are illustrated byparticular examples. Both trains of thought are in fact extremely simple and elementary. Itcould hardly be otherwise, since they are familiar in the concrete, though certainly not in theabstract, to the crude intelligence not only of the savage, but of ignorant and dull-witted peo-ple everywhere. Both branches of magic, the homoeopathic and the contagious, may conve-niently be comprehended under the general name of Sympathetic Magic, since both assumethat things act on each other at a distance through a secret sympathy, the impulse beingtransmitted from one to the other by means of what we may conceive as a kind of invisibleether, not unlike that which is postulated by modern science for a precisely similar purpose,namely, to explain how things can physically affect each other through a space which appearsto be empty.It may be convenient to tabulate as follows the branches of magic according to the laws ofthought which underlie them:Sympathetic Magic(Law of Sympathy)|_____________________________________||||Homoeopathic MagicContagious Magic(Law of Similarity)(Law of Contact)Page 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"I will now illustrate these two great branches of sympathetic magic by examples, beginningwith homoeopathic magic. 2. HOMOEOPATHIC OR IMITATIVE MAGICPerhaps the most familiar application of the principle that like produces like is the attemptwhich has been made by many peoples in many ages to injure or destroy an enemy by injur-ing or destroying an image of him, in the belief that, just as the image suffers, so does theman, and that when it perishes he must die. A few instances out of many may be given toprove at once the wide diffusion of the practice over the world and its remarkable persistencethrough the ages. For thousands of years ago it was known to the sorcerers of ancient India,Babylon, and Egypt, as well as of Greece and Rome, and at this day it is still resorted to bycunning and malignant savages in Australia, Africa, and Scotland. Thus the North AmericanIndians, we are told, believe that by drawing the figure of a person in sand, ashes, or clay, orby considering any object as his body, and then pricking it with a sharp stick or doing it anyother injury, they inflict a corresponding injury on the person represented. For example, whenan Ojebway Indian desires to work evil on any one, he makes a little wooden image of hisenemy and runs a needle into its head or heart, or he shoots an arrow into it, believing thatwherever the needle pierces or the arrow strikes the image, his foe will the same instant beseized with a sharp pain in the corresponding part of his body; but if he intends to kill the per-son outright, he burns or buries the puppet, uttering certain magic words as he does so. ThePeruvian Indians moulded images of fat mixed with grain to imitate the persons whom theydisliked or feared, and then burned the effigy on the road where the intended victim was topass. This they called burning his soul. AMalay charm of the same sort is as follows. Take parings of nails, hair, eyebrows, spittle,and so forth of your intended victim, enough to represent every part of his person, and thenmake them up into his likeness with wax from a deserted bees’ comb. Scorch the figure slow-ly by holding it over a lamp every night for seven nights, and say: “It is not wax that I am scorching, It is the liver, heart, and spleen of So-and-so that I scorch.” After the seventh time burn the figure, and your victim will die. This charm obviously com-bines the principles of homoeopathic and contagious magic; since the image which is madein the likeness of an enemy contains things which once were in contact with him, namely, hisnails, hair, and spittle. Another form of the Malay charm, which resembles the Ojebway prac-tice still more closely, is to make a corpse of wax from an empty bees’ comb and of the lengthof a footstep; then pierce the eye of the image, and your enemy is blind; pierce the stomach,and he is sick; pierce the head, and his head aches; pierce the breast, and his breast will suf-fer. If you would kill him outright, transfix the image from the head downwards; enshroud it asyou would a corpse; pray over it as if you were praying over the dead; then bury it in the mid-dle of a path where your victim will be sure to step over it. In order that his blood may not beon your head, you should say: “It is not I who am burying him, It is Gabriel who is burying him.” Thus the guilt of the murder will be laid on the shoulders of the archangel Gabriel, who is aPage 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"great deal better able to bear it than you are.If homoeopathic or imitative magic, working by means of images, has commonly been prac-tised for the spiteful purpose of putting obnoxious people out of the world, it has also, thoughfar more rarely, been employed with the benevolent intention of helping others into it. In otherwords, it has been used to facilitate childbirth and to procure offspring for barren women.Thus among the Bataks of Sumatra a barren woman, who would become a mother, will makea wooden image of a child and hold it in her lap, believing that this will lead to the fulfilment ofher wish. In the Babar Archipelago, when a woman desires to have a child, she invites a manwho is himself the father of a large family to pray on her behalf to Upulero, the spirit of thesun. A doll is made of red cotton, which the woman clasps in her arms, as if she would suckleit. Then the father of many children takes a fowl and holds it by the legs to the woman’s head,saying, “O Upulero, make use of the fowl; let fall, let descend a child, I beseech you, I entreatyou, let a child fall and descend into my hands and on my lap.” Then he asks the woman,“Has the child come?” and she answers, “Yes, it is sucking already.” After that the man holdsthe fowl on the husband’s head, and mumbles some form of words. Lastly, the bird is killedand laid, together with some betel, on the domestic place of sacrifice. When the ceremony isover, word goes about in the village that the woman has been brought to bed, and her friendscome and congratulate her. Here the pretence that a child has been born is a purely magicalrite designed to secure, by means of imitation or mimicry, that a child really shall be born; butan attempt is made to add to the efficacy of the rite by means of prayer and sacrifice. To put itotherwise, magic is here blent with and reinforced by religion.Among some of the Dyaks of Borneo, when a woman is in hard labour, a wizard is called in,who essays to facilitate the delivery in a rational manner by manipulating the body of the suf-ferer. Meantime another wizard outside the room exerts himself to attain the same end bymeans which we should regard as wholly irrational. He, in fact, pretends to be the expectantmother; a large stone attached to his stomach by a cloth wrapt round his body represents thechild in the womb, and, following the directions shouted to him by his colleague on the realscene of operations, he moves this make-believe baby about on his body in exact imitation ofthe movements of the real baby till the infant is born.The same principle of make-believe, so dear to children, has led other peoples to employ asimulation of birth as a form of adoption, and even as a mode of restoring a supposed deadperson to life. If you pretend to give birth to a boy, or even to a great bearded man who hasnot a drop of your blood in his veins, then, in the eyes of primitive law and philosophy, thatboy or man is really your son to all intents and purposes. Thus Diodorus tells us that whenZeus persuaded his jealous wife Hera to adopt Hercules, the goddess got into bed, andclasping the burly hero to her bosom, pushed him through her robes and let him fall to theground in imitation of a real birth; and the historian adds that in his own day the same modeof adopting children was practised by the barbarians. At the present time it is said to be still inuse in Bulgaria and among the Bosnian Turks. A woman will take a boy whom she intends toadopt and push or pull him through her clothes; ever afterwards he is regarded as her veryson, and inherits the whole property of his adoptive parents. Among the Berawans ofSarawak, when a woman desires to adopt a grownup man or woman, a great many peopleassemble and have a feast. The adopting mother, seated in public on a raised and coveredseat, allows the adopted person to crawl from behind between her legs. As soon as heappears in front he is stroked with the sweet-scented blossoms of the areca palm and tied toa woman. Then the adopting mother and the adopted son or daughter, thus bound together,waddle to the end of the house and back again in front of all the spectators. The tie estab-Page 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"lished between the two by this graphic imitation of childbirth is very strict; an offence commit-ted against an adopted child is reckoned more heinous than one committed against a realchild. In ancient Greece any man who had been supposed erroneously to be dead, and forwhom in his absence funeral rites had been performed, was treated as dead to society till hehad gone through the form of being born again. He was passed through a woman’s lap, thenwashed, dressed in swaddling-clothes, and put out to nurse. Not until this ceremony hadbeen punctually performed might he mix freely with living folk. In ancient India, under similarcircumstances, the supposed dead man had to pass the first night after his return in a tubfilled with a mixture of fat and water; there he sat with doubled-up fists and without uttering asyllable, like a child in the womb, while over him were performed all the sacraments that werewont to be celebrated over a pregnant woman. Next morning he got out of the tub and wentthrough once more all the other sacraments he had formerly partaken of from his youth up; inparticular, he married a wife or espoused his old one over again with due solemnity.Another beneficent use of homoeopathic magic is to heal or prevent sickness. The ancientHindoos performed an elaborate ceremony, based on homoeopathic magic, for the cure ofjaundice. Its main drift was to banish the yellow colour to yellow creatures and yellow things,such as the sun, to which it properly belongs, and to procure for the patient a healthy redcolour from a living, vigorous source, namely, a red bull. With this intention, a priest recitedthe following spell: “Up to the sun shall go thy heart-ache and thy jaundice: in the colour ofthe red bull do we envelop thee! We envelop thee in red tints, unto long life. May this persongo unscathed and be free of yellow colour! The cows whose divinity is Rohini, they who,moreover, are themselves red (rohinih)—in their every form and every strength we do envelopthee. Into the parrots, into the thrush, do we put thy jaundice, and, furthermore, into the yel-low wagtail do we put thy jaundice.” While he uttered these words, the priest, in order toinfuse the rosy hue of health into the sallow patient, gave him water to sip which was mixedwith the hair of a red bull; he poured water over the animal’s back and made the sick mandrink it; he seated him on the skin of a red bull and tied a piece of the skin to him. Then inorder to improve his colour by thoroughly eradicating the yellow taint, he proceeded thus. Hefirst daubed him from head to foot with a yellow porridge made of tumeric or curcuma (a yel-low plant), set him on a bed, tied three yellow birds, to wit, a parrot, a thrush, and a yellowwagtail, by means of a yellow string to the foot of the bed; then pouring water over thepatient, he washed off the yellow porridge, and with it no doubt the jaundice, from him to thebirds. After that, by way of giving a final bloom to his complexion, he took some hairs of a redbull, wrapt them in gold leaf, and glued them to the patient’s skin. The ancients held that if aperson suffering from jaundice looked sharply at a stone-curlew, and the bird looked steadilyat him, he was cured of the disease. “Such is the nature,” says Plutarch, “and such the tem-perament of the creature that it draws out and receives the malady which issues, like astream, through the eyesight.” So well recognised among birdfanciers was this valuable prop-erty of the stone-curlew that when they had one of these birds for sale they kept it carefullycovered, lest a jaundiced person should look at it and be cured for nothing. The virtue of thebird lay not in its colour but in its large golden eye, which naturally drew out the yellow jaun-dice. Pliny tells of another, or perhaps the same, bird, to which the Greeks gave their namefor jaundice, because if a jaundiced man saw it, the disease left him and slew the bird. Hementions also a stone which was supposed to cure jaundice because its hue resembled thatof a jaundiced skin.One of the great merits of homoeopathic magic is that it enables the cure to be performed onthe person of the doctor instead of on that of his victim, who is thus relieved of all trouble andinconvenience, while he sees his medical man writhe in anguish before him. For example, thePage 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"peasants of Perche, in France, labour under the impression that a prolonged fit of vomiting isbrought about by the patient’s stomach becoming unhooked, as they call it, and so fallingdown. Accordingly, a practitioner is called in to restore the organ to its proper place. Afterhearing the symptoms he at once throws himself into the most horrible contortions, for thepurpose of unhooking his own stomach. Having succeeded in the effort, he next hooks it upagain in another series of contortions and grimaces, while the patient experiences a corre-sponding relief. Fee five francs. In like manner a Dyak medicine-man, who has been fetchedin a case of illness, will lie down and pretend to be dead. He is accordingly treated like acorpse, is bound up in mats, taken out of the house, and deposited on the ground. After aboutan hour the other medicine-men loose the pretended dead man and bring him to life; and ashe recovers, the sick person is supposed to recover too. A cure for a tumour, based on theprinciple of homoeopathic magic, is prescribed by Marcellus of Bordeaux, court physician toTheodosius the First, in his curious work on medicine. It is as follows. Take a root of vervain,cut it across, and hang one end of it round the patient’s neck, and the other in the smoke ofthe fire. As the vervain dries up in the smoke, so the tumour will also dry up and disappear. Ifthe patient should afterwards prove ungrateful to the good physician, the man of skill canavenge himself very easily by throwing the vervain into water; for as the root absorbs themoisture once more, the tumour will return. The same sapient writer recommends you, if youare troubled with pimples, to watch for a falling star, and then instantly, while the star is stillshooting from the sky, to wipe the pimples with a cloth or anything that comes to hand. Justas the star falls from the sky, so the pimples will fall from your body; only you must be verycareful not to wipe them with your bare hand, or the pimples will be transferred to it.Further, homoeopathic and in general sympathetic magic plays a great part in the measurestaken by the rude hunter or fisherman to secure an abundant supply of food. On the principlethat like produces like, many things are done by him and his friends in deliberate imitation ofthe result which he seeks to attain; and, on the other hand, many things are scrupulouslyavoided because they bear some more or less fanciful resemblance to others which wouldreally be disastrous.Nowhere is the theory of sympathetic magic more systematically carried into practice for themaintenance of the food supply than in the barren regions of Central Australia. Here the tribesare divided into a number of totem clans, each of which is charged with the duty of multiplyingtheir totem for the good of the community by means of magical ceremonies. Most of thetotems are edible animals and plants, and the general result supposed to be accomplished bythese ceremonies is that of supplying the tribe with food and other necessaries. Often therites consist of an imitation of the effect which the people desire to produce; in other words,their magic is homoeopathic or imitative. Thus among the Warramunga the headman of thewhite cockatoo totem seeks to multiply white cockatoos by holding an effigy of the bird andmimicking its harsh cry. Among the Arunta the men of the witchetty grub totem perform cere-monies for multiplying the grub which the other members of the tribe use as food. One of theceremonies is a pantomime representing the fully-developed insect in the act of emergingfrom the chrysalis. A long narrow structure of branches is set up to imitate the chrysalis caseof the grub. In this structure a number of men, who have the grub for their totem, sit and singof the creature in its various stages. Then they shuffle out of it in a squatting posture, and asthey do so they sing of the insect emerging from the chrysalis. This is supposed to multiplythe numbers of the grubs. Again, in order to multiply emus, which are an important article offood, the men of the emu totem paint on the ground the sacred design of their totem, espe-cially the parts of the emu which they like best to eat, namely, the fat and the eggs. Roundthis painting the men sit and sing. Afterwards performers, wearing head-dresses to representPage 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"the long neck and small head of the emu, mimic the appearance of the bird as it stands aim-lessly peering about in all directions.The Indians of British Columbia live largely upon the fish which abound in their seas andrivers. If the fish do not come in due season, and the Indians are hungry, a Nootka wizard willmake an image of a swimming fish and put it into the water in the direction from which thefish generally appear. This ceremony, accompanied by a prayer to the fish to come, will causethem to arrive at once. The islanders of Torres Straits use models of dugong and turtles tocharm dugong and turtle to their destruction. The Toradjas of Central Celebes believe thatthings of the same sort attract each other by means of their indwelling spirits or vital ether.Hence they hang up the jawbones of deer and wild pigs in their houses, in order that the spir-its which animate these bones may draw the living creatures of the same kind into the path ofthe hunter. In the island of Nias, when a wild pig has fallen into the pit prepared for it, the ani-mal is taken out and its back is rubbed with nine fallen leaves, in the belief that this will makenine more wild pigs fall into the pit, just as the nine leaves fell from the tree. In the EastIndian islands of Saparoea, Haroekoe, and Noessa Laut, when a fisherman is about to set atrap for fish in the sea, he looks out for a tree, of which the fruit has been much pecked at bybirds. From such a tree he cuts a stout branch and makes of it the principal post in his fish-trap; for he believes that, just as the tree lured many birds to its fruit, so the branch cut fromthat tree will lure many fish to the trap.The western tribes of British New Guinea employ a charm to aid the hunter in spearingdugong or turtle. A small beetle, which haunts coco-nut trees, is placed in the hole of thespear-haft into which the spear-head fits. This is supposed to make the spear-head stick fastin the dugong or turtle, just as the beetle sticks fast to a man’s skin when it bites him. When aCambodian hunter has set his nets and taken nothing, he strips himself naked, goes someway off, then strolls up to the net as if he did not see it, lets himself be caught in it, and cries,“Hillo! what’s this? I’m afraid I’m caught.” After that the net is sure to catch game. A pan-tomime of the same sort has been acted within the living memory in our Scottish Highlands.The Rev. James Macdonald, now of Reay in Caithness, tells us that in his boyhood when hewas fishing with companions about Loch Aline and they had had no bites for a long time, theyused to make a pretence of throwing one of their fellows overboard and hauling him out of thewater, as if he were a fish; after that the trout or silloch would begin to nibble, according asthe boat was on fresh or salt water. Before a Carrier Indian goes out to snare martens, hesleeps by himself for about ten nights beside the fire with a little stick pressed down on hisneck. This naturally causes the fall-stick of his trap to drop down on the neck of the marten.Among the Galelareese, who inhabit a district in the northern part of Halmahera, a largeisland to the west of New Guinea, it is a maxim that when you are loading your gun to go outshooting, you should always put the bullet in your mouth before you insert it in the gun; for byso doing you practically eat the game that is to be hit by the bullet, which therefore cannotpossibly miss the mark. A Malay who has baited a trap for crocodiles, and is awaiting results,is careful in eating his curry always to begin by swallowing three lumps of rice successively;for this helps the bait to slide more easily down the crocodile’s throat. He is equally scrupu-lous not to take any bones out of his curry; for, if he did, it seems clear that the sharp-pointedstick on which the bait is skewered would similarly work itself loose, and the crocodile wouldget off with the bait. Hence in these circumstances it is prudent for the hunter, before hebegins his meal, to get somebody else to take the bones out of his curry, otherwise he may atany moment have to choose between swallowing a bone and losing the crocodile.This last rule is an instance of the things which the hunter abstains from doing lest, on thePage 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"principle that like produces like, they should spoil his luck. For it is to be observed that thesystem of sympathetic magic is not merely composed of positive precepts; it comprises avery large number of negative precepts, that is, prohibitions. It tells you not merely what todo, but also what to leave undone. The positive precepts are charms: the negative preceptsare taboos. In fact the whole doctrine of taboo, or at all events a large part of it, would seemto be only a special application of sympathetic magic, with its two great laws of similarity andcontact. Though these laws are certainly not formulated in so many words nor even con-ceived in the abstract by the savage, they are nevertheless implicitly believed by him to regu-late the course of nature quite independently of human will. He thinks that if he acts in a cer-tain way, certain consequences will inevitably follow in virtue of one or other of these laws;and if the consequences of a particular act appear to him likely to prove disagreeable or dan-gerous, he is naturally careful not to act in that way lest he should incur them. In other words,he abstains from doing that which, in accordance with his mistaken notions of cause andeffect, he falsely believes would injure him; in short, he subjects himself to a taboo. Thustaboo is so far a negative application of practical magic. Positive magic or sorcery says, “Dothis in order that so and so may happen.” Negative magic or taboo says, “Do not do this, lestso and so should happen.” The aim of positive magic or sorcery is to produce a desiredevent; the aim of negative magic or taboo is to avoid an undesirable one. But both conse-quences, the desirable and the undesirable, are supposed to be brought about in accordancewith the laws of similarity and contact. And just as the desired consequence is not reallyeffected by the observance of a magical ceremony, so the dreaded consequence does notreally result from the violation of a taboo. If the supposed evil necessarily followed a breachof taboo, the taboo would not be a taboo but a precept of morality or common sense. It is nota taboo to say, “Do not put your hand in the fire”; it is a rule of common sense, because theforbidden action entails a real, not an imaginary evil. In short, those negative precepts whichwe call taboo are just as vain and futile as those positive precepts which we call sorcery. Thetwo things are merely opposite sides or poles of one great disastrous fallacy, a mistaken con-ception of the association of ideas. Of that fallacy, sorcery is the positive, and taboo the nega-tive pole. If we give the general name of magic to the whole erroneous system, both theoreti-cal and practical, then taboo may be defined as the negative side of practical magic. To putthis in tabular form:Magic|_________________________________________________||||TheoreticalPractical(Magic as a pseudo-science)(Magic as a pseudo-art)||_____________________||Page 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"PositiveNegativeMagic orMagic orSorceryTabooI have made these remarks on taboo and its relations to magic because I am about to givesome instances of taboos observed by hunters, fishermen, and others, and I wished to showthat they fall under the head of Sympathetic Magic, being only particular applications of thatgeneral theory. Thus, among the Esquimaux boys are forbidden to play cat’s cradle, becauseif they did so their fingers might in later life become entangled in the harpoon-line. Here thetaboo is obviously an application of the law of similarity, which is the basis of homoeopathicmagic: as the child’s fingers are entangled by the string in playing cat’s cradle, so they will beentangled by the harpoon-line when he is a man and hunts whales. Again, among the Huzulsof the Carpathian Mountains the wife of a hunter may not spin while her husband is eating, orthe game will turn and wind like the spindle, and the hunter will be unable to hit it. Here againthe taboo is clearly derived from the law of similarity. So, too, in most parts of ancient Italywomen were forbidden by law to spin on the highroads as they walked, or even to carry theirspindles openly, because any such action was believed to injure the crops. Probably thenotion was that the twirling of the spindle would twirl the corn-stalks and prevent them fromgrowing straight. So, too, among the Ainos of Saghalien a pregnant woman may not spin nortwist ropes for two months before her delivery, because they think that if she did so the child’sguts might be entangled like the thread. For a like reason in Bilaspore, a district of India,when the chief men of a village meet in council, no one present should twirl a spindle; forthey think that if such a thing were to happen, the discussion, like the spindle, would move ina circle and never be wound up. In some of the East Indian islands any one who comes tothe house of a hunter must walk straight in; he may not loiter at the door, for were he to doso, the game would in like manner stop in front of the hunter’s snares and then turn back,instead of being caught in the trap. For a similar reason it is a rule with the Toradjas ofCentral Celebes that no one may stand or loiter on the ladder of a house where there is apregnant woman, for such delay would retard the birth of the child; and in various parts ofSumatra the woman herself in these circumstances is forbidden to stand at the door or on thetop rung of the house-ladder under pain of suffering hard labour for her imprudence inneglecting so elementary a precaution. Malays engaged in the search for camphor eat theirfood dry and take care not to pound their salt fine. The reason is that the camphor occurs inthe form of small grains deposited in the cracks of the trunk of the camphor tree. Accordinglyit seems plain to the Malay that if, while seeking for camphor, he were to eat his salt finelyground, the camphor would be found also in fine grains; whereas by eating his salt coarse heensures that the grains of the camphor will also be large. Camphor hunters in Borneo use theleathery sheath of the leaf-stalk of the Penang palm as a plate for food, and during the wholeof the expedition they will never wash the plate, for fear that the camphor might dissolve anddisappear from the crevices of the tree. Apparently they think that to wash their plates wouldbe to wash out the camphor crystals from the trees in which they are imbedded. The chiefproduct of some parts of Laos, a province of Siam, is lac. This is a resinous gum exuded by ared insect on the young branches of trees, to which the little creatures have to be attached byhand. All who engage in the business of gathering the gum abstain from washing themselvesand especially from cleansing their heads, lest by removing the parasites from their hair theyshould detach the other insects from the boughs. Again, a Blackfoot Indian who has set a trapfor eagles, and is watching it, would not eat rosebuds on any account; for he argues that if hePage 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"did so, and an eagle alighted near the trap, the rosebuds in his own stomach would make thebird itch, with the result that instead of swallowing the bait the eagle would merely sit andscratch himself. Following this train of thought the eagle hunter also refrains from using anawl when he is looking after his snares; for surely if he were to scratch with an awl, theeagles would scratch him. The same disastrous consequence would follow if his wives andchildren at home used an awl while he is out after eagles, and accordingly they are forbiddento handle the tool in his absence for fear of putting him in bodily danger.Among the taboos observed by savages none perhaps are more numerous or important thanthe prohibitions to eat certain foods, and of such prohibitions many are demonstrably derivedfrom the law of similarity and are accordingly examples of negative magic. Just as the savageeats many animals or plants in order to acquire certain desirable qualities with which hebelieves them to be endowed, so he avoids eating many other animals and plants lest heshould acquire certain undesirable qualities with which he believes them to be infected. Ineating the former he practises positive magic; in abstaining from the latter he practises nega-tive magic. Many examples of such positive magic will meet us later on; here I will give a fewinstances of such negative magic or taboo. For example, in Madagascar soldiers are forbid-den to eat a number of foods lest on the principle of homoeopathic magic they should betainted by certain dangerous or undesirable properties which are supposed to inhere in theseparticular viands. Thus they may not taste hedgehog, “as it is feared that this animal, from itspropensity of coiling up into a ball when alarmed, will impart a timid shrinking disposition tothose who partake of it.” Again, no soldier should eat an ox’s knee, lest like an ox he shouldbecome weak in the knees and unable to march. Further, the warrior should be careful toavoid partaking of a cock that has died fighting or anything that has been speared to death;and no male animal may on any account be killed in his house while he is away at the wars.For it seems obvious that if he were to eat a cock that had died fighting, he would himself beslain on the field of battle; if he were to partake of an animal that had been speared, he wouldbe speared himself; if a male animal were killed in his house during his absence, he wouldhimself be killed in like manner and perhaps at the same instant. Further, the Malagasy sol-dier must eschew kidneys, because in the Malagasy language the word for kidney is thesame as that for “shot”; so shot he would certainly be if he ate a kidney.The reader may have observed that in some of the foregoing examples of taboos the magicalinfluence is supposed to operate at considerable distances; thus among the Blackfeet Indiansthe wives and children of an eagle hunter are forbidden to use an awl during his absence, lestthe eagles should scratch the distant husband and father; and again no male animal may bekilled in the house of a Malagasy soldier while he is away at the wars, lest the killing of theanimal should entail the killing of the man. This belief in the sympathetic influence exerted oneach other by persons or things at a distance is of the essence of magic. Whatever doubtsscience may entertain as to the possibility of action at a distance, magic has none; faith intelepathy is one of its first principles. A modern advocate of the influence of mind upon mindat a distance would have no difficulty in convincing a savage; the savage believed in it longago, and what is more, he acted on his belief with a logical consistency such as his civilisedbrother in the faith has not yet, so far as I am aware, exhibited in his conduct. For the savageis convinced not only that magical ceremonies affect persons and things afar off, but that thesimplest acts of daily life may do so too. Hence on important occasions the behaviour offriends and relations at a distance is often regulated by a more or less elaborate code ofrules, the neglect of which by the one set of persons would, it is supposed, entail misfortuneor even death on the absent ones. In particular when a party of men are out hunting or fight-ing, their kinsfolk at home are often expected to do certain things or to abstain from doingPage 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"certain others, for the sake of ensuring the safety and success of the distant hunters or war-riors. I will now give some instances of this magical telepathy both in its positive and in itsnegative aspect.In Laos when an elephant hunter is starting for the chase, he warns his wife not to cut herhair or oil her body in his absence; for if she cut her hair the elephant would burst the toils, ifshe oiled herself it would slip through them. When a Dyak village has turned out to hunt wildpigs in the jungle, the people who stay at home may not touch oil or water with their handsduring the absence of their friends; for if they did so, the hunters would all be “butter-fingered”and the prey would slip through their hands.Elephant-hunters in East Africa believe that, if their wives prove unfaithful in their absence,this gives the elephant power over his pursuer, who will accordingly be killed or severelywounded. Hence if a hunter hears of his wife’s misconduct, he abandons the chase andreturns home. If a Wagogo hunter is unsuccessful, or is attacked by a lion, he attributes it tohis wife’s misbehaviour at home, and returns to her in great wrath. While he is away hunting,she may not let any one pass behind her or stand in front of her as she sits; and she must lieon her face in bed. The Moxos Indians of Bolivia thought that if a hunter’s wife was unfaithfulto him in his absence he would be bitten by a serpent or a jaguar. Accordingly, if such anaccident happened to him, it was sure to entail the punishment, and often the death, of thewoman, whether she was innocent or guilty. An Aleutian hunter of sea-otters thinks that hecannot kill a single animal if during his absence from home his wife should be unfaithful or hissister unchaste.The Huichol Indians of Mexico treat as a demi-god a species of cactus which throws the eaterinto a state of ecstasy. The plant does not grow in their country, and has to be fetched everyyear by men who make a journey of forty-three days for the purpose. Meanwhile the wives athome contribute to the safety of their absent husbands by never walking fast, much less run-ning, while the men are on the road. They also do their best to ensure the benefits which, inthe shape of rain, good crops, and so forth, are expected to flow from the sacred mission.With this intention they subject themselves to severe restrictions like those imposed upontheir husbands. During the whole of the time which elapses till the festival of the cactus isheld, neither party washes except on certain occasions, and then only with water broughtfrom the distant country where the holy plant grows. They also fast much, eat no salt, and arebound to strict continence. Any one who breaks this law is punished with illness, and, more-over, jeopardises the result which all are striving for. Health, luck, and life are to be gained bygathering the cactus, the gourd of the God of Fire; but inasmuch as the pure fire cannot ben-efit the impure, men and women must not only remain chaste for the time being, but mustalso purge themselves from the taint of past sin. Hence four days after the men have startedthe women gather and confess to Grandfather Fire with what men they have been in lovefrom childhood till now. They may not omit a single one, for if they did so the men would notfind a single cactus. So to refresh their memories each one prepares a string with as manyknots as she has had lovers. This she brings to the temple, and, standing before the fire, shementions aloud all the men she has scored on her string, name after name. Having endedher confession, she throws the string into the fire, and when the god has consumed it in hispure flame, her sins are forgiven her and she departs in peace. From now on the women areaverse even to letting men pass near them. The cactus-seekers themselves make in likemanner a clean breast of all their frailties. For every peccadillo they tie a knot on a string, andafter they have “talked to all the five winds” they deliver the rosary of their sins to the leader,who burns it in the fire. Page 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Many of the indigenous tribes of Sarawak are firmly persuaded that were the wives to commitadultery while their husbands are searching for camphor in the jungle, the camphor obtainedby the men would evaporate. Husbands can discover, by certain knots in the tree, when thewives are unfaithful; and it is said that in former days many women were killed by jealoushusbands on no better evidence than that of these knots. Further, the wives dare not touch acomb while their husbands are away collecting the camphor; for if they did so, the intersticesbetween the fibres of the tree, instead of being filled with the precious crystals, would beempty like the spaces between the teeth of a comb. In the Kei Islands, to the southwest ofNew Guinea, as soon as a vessel that is about to sail for a distant port has been launched,the part of the beach on which it lay is covered as speedily as possible with palm branches,and becomes sacred. No one may thenceforth cross that spot till the ship comes home. Tocross it sooner would cause the vessel to perish. Moreover, all the time that the voyage laststhree or four young girls, specially chosen for the duty, are supposed to remain in sympatheticconnexion with the mariners and to contribute by their behaviour to the safety and success ofthe voyage. On no account, except for the most necessary purpose, may they quit the roomthat has been assigned to them. More than that, so long as the vessel is believed to be atsea they must remain absolutely motionless, crouched on their mats with their hands claspedbetween their knees. They may not turn their heads to the left or to the right or make anyother movement whatsoever. If they did, it would cause the boat to pitch and toss; and theymay not eat any sticky stuff, such as rice boiled in coco-nut milk, for the stickiness of the foodwould clog the passage of the boat through the water. When the sailors are supposed to havereached their destination, the strictness of these rules is somewhat relaxed; but during thewhole time that the voyage lasts the girls are forbidden to eat fish which have sharp bones orstings, such as the sting-ray, lest their friends at sea should be involved in sharp, stingingtrouble.Where beliefs like these prevail as to the sympathetic connexion between friends at a dis-tance, we need not wonder that above everything else war, with its stern yet stirring appeal tosome of the deepest and tenderest of human emotions, should quicken in the anxious rela-tions left behind a desire to turn the sympathetic bond to the utmost account for the benefit ofthe dear ones who may at any moment be fighting and dying far away. Hence, to secure anend so natural and laudable, friends at home are apt to resort to devices which will strike usas pathetic or ludicrous, according as we consider their object or the means adopted to effectit. Thus in some districts of Borneo, when a Dyak is out head-hunting, his wife or, if he isunmarried, his sister must wear a sword day and night in order that he may always be think-ing of his weapons; and she may not sleep during the day nor go to bed before two in themorning, lest her husband or brother should thereby be surprised in his sleep by an enemy.Among the Sea Dyaks of Banting in Sarawak the women strictly observe an elaborate codeof rules while the men are away fighting. Some of the rules are negative and some are posi-tive, but all alike are based on the principles of magical homoeopathy and telepathy. Amongstthem are the following. The women must wake very early in the morning and open the win-dows as soon as it is light; otherwise their absent husbands will oversleep themselves. Thewomen may not oil their hair, or the men will slip. The women may neither sleep nor doze byday, or the men will be drowsy on the march. The women must cook and scatter popcorn onthe verandah every morning; so will the men be agile in their movements. The rooms must bekept very tidy, all boxes being placed near the walls; for if any one were to stumble overthem, the absent husbands would fall and be at the mercy of the foe. At every meal a littlerice must be left in the pot and put aside; so will the men far away always have something toeat and need never go hungry. On no account may the women sit at the loom till their legsPage 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"grow cramped, otherwise their husbands will likewise be stiff in their joints and unable to riseup quickly or to run away from the foe. So in order to keep their husbands’ joints supple thewomen often vary their labours at the loom by walking up and down the verandah. Further,they may not cover up their faces, or the men would not to be able to find their way throughthe tall grass or jungle. Again, the women may not sew with a needle, or the men will tread onthe sharp spikes set by the enemy in the path. Should a wife prove unfaithful while her hus-band is away, he will lose his life in the enemy’s country. Some years ago all these rules andmore were observed by the women of Banting, while their husbands were fighting for theEnglish against rebels. But alas! these tender precautions availed them little; for many a man,whose faithful wife was keeping watch and ward for him at home, found a soldier’s grave.In the island of Timor, while war is being waged, the high-priest never quits the temple; hisfood is brought to him or cooked inside; day and night he must keep the fire burning, for if hewere to let it die out, disaster would befall the warriors and would continue so long as thehearth was cold. Moreover, he must drink only hot water during the time the army is absent;for every draught of cold water would damp the spirits of the people, so that they could notvanquish the enemy. In the Kei Islands, when the warriors have departed, the women returnindoors and bring out certain baskets containing fruits and stones. These fruits and stonesthey anoint and place on a board, murmuring as they do so, “O lord sun, moon, let the bulletsrebound from our husbands, brothers, betrothed, and other relations, just as raindropsrebound from these objects which are smeared with oil.” As soon as the first shot is heard,the baskets are put aside, and the women, seizing their fans, rush out of the houses. Then,waving their fans in the direction of the enemy, they run through the village, while they sing,“O golden fans! let our bullets hit, and those of the enemy miss.” In this custom the ceremonyof anointing stones, in order that the bullets may recoil from the men like raindrops from thestones, is a piece of pure homoeopathic or imitative magic; but the prayer to the sun, that hewill be pleased to give effect to the charm, is a religious and perhaps later addition. The wav-ing of the fans seems to be a charm to direct the bullets towards or away from their mark,according as they are discharged from the guns of friends or foes.An old historian of Madagascar informs us that “while the men are at the wars, and until theirreturn, the women and girls cease not day and night to dance, and neither lie down nor takefood in their own houses. And although they are very voluptuously inclined, they would not foranything in the world have an intrigue with another man while their husband is at the war,believing firmly that if that happened, their husband would be either killed or wounded. Theybelieve that by dancing they impart strength, courage, and good fortune to their husbands;accordingly during such times they give themselves no rest, and this custom they observevery religiously.”Among the Tshi-speaking peoples of the Gold Coast the wives of men who are away with thearmy paint themselves white, and adorn their persons with beads and charms. On the daywhen a battle is expected to take place, they run about armed with guns, or sticks carved tolook like guns, and taking green paw-paws (fruits shaped somewhat like a melon), they hackthem with knives, as if they were chopping off the heads of the foe. The pantomime is nodoubt merely an imitative charm, to enable the men to do to the enemy as the women do tothe paw-paws. In the West African town of Framin, while the Ashantee war was raging someyears ago, Mr. Fitzgerald Marriott saw a dance performed by women whose husbands hadgone as carriers to the war. They were painted white and wore nothing but a short petticoat.At their head was a shrivelled old sorceress in a very short white petticoat, her black hairarranged in a sort of long projecting horn, and her black face, breasts, arms, and legs pro-Page 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"fusely adorned with white circles and crescents. All carried long white brushes made of buffa-lo or horse tails, and as they danced they sang, “Our husbands have gone to Ashanteeland;may they sweep their enemies off the face of the earth!” Among the Thompson Indians of British Columbia, when the men were on the war-path, thewomen performed dances at frequent intervals. These dances were believed to ensure thesuccess of the expedition. The dancers flourished their knives, threw long sharp-pointedsticks forward, or drew sticks with hooked ends repeatedly backward and forward. Throwingthe sticks forward was symbolic of piercing or warding off the enemy, and drawing them backwas symbolic of drawing their own men from danger. The hook at the end of the stick wasparticularly well adapted to serve the purpose of a life-saving apparatus. The women alwayspointed their weapons towards the enemy’s country. They painted their faces red and sang asthey danced, and they prayed to the weapons to preserve their husbands and help them tokill many foes. Some had eagle-down stuck on the points of their sticks. When the dance wasover, these weapons were hidden. If a woman whose husband was at the war thought shesaw hair or a piece of a scalp on the weapon when she took it out, she knew that her hus-band had killed an enemy. But if she saw a stain of blood on it, she knew he was wounded ordead. When the men of the Yuki tribe in California were away fighting, the women at homedid not sleep; they danced continually in a circle, chanting and waving leafy wands. For theysaid that if they danced all the time, their husbands would not grow tired. Among the HaidaIndians of the Queen Charlotte Islands, when the men had gone to war, the women at homewould get up very early in the morning and pretend to make war by falling upon their childrenand feigning to take them for slaves. This was supposed to help their husbands to go and dolikewise. If a wife were unfaithful to her husband while he was away on the war-path, hewould probably be killed. For ten nights all the women at home lay with their heads towardsthe point of the compass to which the war-canoes had paddled away. Then they changedabout, for the warriors were supposed to be coming home across the sea. At Masset theHaida women danced and sang war-songs all the time their husbands were away at the wars,and they had to keep everything about them in a certain order. It was thought that a wifemight kill her husband by not observing these customs. When a band of Carib Indians of theOrinoco had gone on the war-path, their friends left in the village used to calculate as nearlyas they could the exact moment when the absent warriors would be advancing to attack theenemy. Then they took two lads, laid them down on a bench, and inflicted a most severescourging on their bare backs. This the youths submitted to without a murmur, supported intheir sufferings by the firm conviction, in which they had been bred from childhood, that on theconstancy and fortitude with which they bore the cruel ordeal depended the valour and suc-cess of their comrades in the battle.Among the many beneficent uses to which a mistaken ingenuity has applied the principle ofhomoeopathic or imitative magic, is that of causing trees and plants to bear fruit in due sea-son. In Thüringen the man who sows flax carries the seed in a long bag which reaches fromhis shoulders to his knees, and he walks with long strides, so that the bag sways to and froon his back. It is believed that this will cause the flax to wave in the wind. In the interior ofSumatra rice is sown by women who, in sowing, let their hair hang loose down their back, inorder that the rice may grow luxuriantly and have long stalks. Similarly, in ancient Mexico afestival was held in honour of the goddess of maize, or “the long-haired mother,” as she wascalled. It began at the time “when the plant had attained its full growth, and fibres shootingforth from the top of the green ear indicated that the grain was fully formed. During this festi-val the women wore their long hair unbound, shaking and tossing it in the dances which werethe chief feature in the ceremonial, in order that the tassel of the maize might grow in like pro-Page 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"fusion, that the grain might be correspondingly large and flat, and that the people might haveabundance.” In many parts of Europe dancing or leaping high in the air are approvedhomoeopathic modes of making the crops grow high. Thus in Franche-Comté they say thatyou should dance at the Carnival in order to make the hemp grow tall.The notion that a person can influence a plant homoeopathically by his act or conditioncomes out clearly in a remark made by a Malay woman. Being asked why she stripped theupper part of her body naked in reaping the rice, she explained that she did it to make therice-husks thinner, as she was tired of pounding thick-husked rice. Clearly, she thought thatthe less clothing she wore the less husk there would be on the rice. The magic virtue of apregnant woman to communicate fertility is known to Bavarian and Austrian peasants, whothink that if you give the first fruit of a tree to a woman with child to eat, the tree will bringforth abundantly next year. On the other hand, the Baganda believe that a barren wife infectsher husband’s garden with her own sterility and prevents the trees from bearing fruit; hence achildless woman is generally divorced. The Greeks and Romans sacrificed pregnant victimsto the goddesses of the corn and of the earth, doubtless in order that the earth might teemand the corn swell in the ear. When a Catholic priest remonstrated with the Indians of theOrinoco on allowing their women to sow the fields in the blazing sun, with infants at theirbreasts, the men answered, “Father, you don’t understand these things, and that is why theyvex you. You know that women are accustomed to bear children, and that we men are not.When the women sow, the stalk of the maize bears two or three ears, the root of the yuccayields two or three basketfuls, and everything multiplies in proportion. Now why is that?Simply because the women know how to bring forth, and know how to make the seed whichthey sow bring forth also. Let them sow, then; we men don’t know as much about it as theydo.”Thus on the theory of homoeopathic magic a person can influence vegetation either for goodor for evil according to the good or the bad character of his acts or states: for example, a fruit-ful woman makes plants fruitful, a barren woman makes them barren. Hence this belief in thenoxious and infectious nature of certain personal qualities or accidents has given rise to anumber of prohibitions or rules of avoidance: people abstain from doing certain things lestthey should homoeopathically infect the fruits of the earth with their own undesirable state orcondition. All such customs of abstention or rules of avoidance are examples of negativemagic or taboo. Thus, for example, arguing from what may be called the infectiousness ofpersonal acts or states, the Galelareese say that you ought not to shoot with a bow andarrows under a fruit-tree, or the tree will cast its fruit even as the arrows fall to the ground;and that when you are eating watermelon you ought not to mix the pips which you spit out ofyour mouth with the pips which you have put aside to serve as seed; for if you do, though thepips you spat out may certainly spring up and blossom, yet the blossoms will keep falling offjust as the pips fell from your mouth, and thus these pips will never bear fruit. Precisely thesame train of thought leads the Bavarian peasant to believe that if he allows the graft of afruit-tree to fall on the ground, the tree that springs from that graft will let its fruit fall untimely.When the Chams of Cochinchina are sowing their dry rice fields and desire that no showershould fall, they eat their rice dry in order to prevent rain from spoiling the crop.In the foregoing cases a person is supposed to influence vegetation homoeopathically. Heinfects trees or plants with qualities or accidents, good or bad, resembling and derived fromhis own. But on the principle of homoeopathic magic the influence is mutual: the plant caninfect the man just as much as the man can infect the plant. In magic, as I believe in physics,action and reaction are equal and opposite. The Cherokee Indians are adepts in practicalPage 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"botany of the homoeopathic sort. Thus wiry roots of the catgut plant are so tough that theycan almost stop a plowshare in the furrow. Hence Cherokee women wash their heads with adecoction of the roots to make the hair strong, and Cherokee ball-players wash themselveswith it to toughen their muscles. It is a Galelareese belief that if you eat a fruit which has fall-en to the ground, you will yourself contract a disposition to stumble and fall; and that if youpartake of something which has been forgotten (such as a sweet potato left in the pot or abanana in the fire), you will become forgetful. The Galelareese are also of opinion that if awoman were to consume two bananas growing from a single head she would give birth totwins. The Guarani Indians of South America thought that a woman would become a motherof twins if she ate a double grain of millet. In Vedic times a curious application of this principlesupplied a charm by which a banished prince might be restored to his kingdom. He had to eatfood cooked on a fire which was fed with wood which had grown out of the stump of a treewhich had been cut down. The recuperative power manifested by such a tree would in duecourse be communicated through the fire to the food, and so to the prince, who ate the foodwhich was cooked on the fire which was fed with the wood which grew out of the tree. TheSudanese think that if a house is built of the wood of thorny trees, the life of the people whodwell in that house will likewise be thorny and full of trouble.There is a fruitful branch of homoeopathic magic which works by means of the dead; for justas the dead can neither see nor hear nor speak, so you may on homoeopathic principles ren-der people blind, deaf and dumb by the use of dead men’s bones or anything else that istainted by the infection of death. Thus among the Galelareese, when a young man goes a-wooing at night, he takes a little earth from a grave and strews it on the roof of his sweet-heart’s house just above the place where her parents sleep. This, he fancies, will preventthem from waking while he converses with his beloved, since the earth from the grave willmake them sleep as sound as the dead. Burglars in all ages and many lands have beenpatrons of this species of magic, which is very useful to them in the exercise of their profes-sion. Thus a South Slavonian housebreaker sometimes begins operations by throwing a deadman’s bone over the house, saying, with pungent sarcasm, “As this bone may waken, so maythese people waken”; after that not a soul in the house can keep his or her eyes open.Similarly, in Java the burglar takes earth from a grave and sprinkles it round the house whichhe intends to rob; this throws the inmates into a deep sleep. With the same intention aHindoo will strew ashes from a pyre at the door of the house; Indians of Peru scatter the dustof dead men’s bones; and Ruthenian burglars remove the marrow from a human shin-bone,pour tallow into it, and having kindled the tallow, march thrice round the house with this can-dle burning, which causes the inmates to sleep a death-like sleep. Or the Ruthenian will makea flute out of a human leg-bone and play upon it; whereupon all persons within hearing areovercome with drowsiness. The Indians of Mexico employed for this maleficent purpose theleft fore-arm of a woman who had died in giving birth to her first child; but the arm had to bestolen. With it they beat the ground before they entered the house which they designed toplunder; this caused every one in the house to lose all power of speech and motion; theywere as dead, hearing and seeing everything, but perfectly powerless; some of them, howev-er, really slept and even snored. In Europe similar properties were ascribed to the Hand ofGlory, which was the dried and pickled hand of a man who had been hanged. If a candlemade of the fat of a malefactor who had also died on the gallows was lighted and placed inthe Hand of Glory as in a candlestick, it rendered motionless all persons to whom it was pre-sented; they could not stir a finger any more than if they were dead. Sometimes the deadman’s hand is itself the candle, or rather bunch of candles, all its withered fingers being seton fire; but should any member of the household be awake, one of the fingers will not kindle.Such nefarious lights can only be extinguished with milk. Often it is prescribed that the thief’sPage 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"candle should be made of the finger of a new-born or, still better, unborn child; sometimes it isthought needful that the thief should have one such candle for every person in the house, forif he has one candle too little somebody in the house will wake and catch him. Once thesetapers begin to burn, there is nothing but milk that will put them out. In the seventeenth centu-ry robbers used to murder pregnant women in order thus to extract candles from their wombs.An ancient Greek robber or burglar thought he could silence and put to flight the fiercestwatchdogs by carrying with him a brand plucked from a funeral pyre. Again, Servian andBulgarian women who chafe at the restraints of domestic life will take the copper coins fromthe eyes of a corpse, wash them in wine or water, and give the liquid to their husbands todrink. After swallowing it, the husband will be as blind to his wife’s peccadilloes as the deadman was on whose eyes the coins were laid.Further, animals are often conceived to possess qualities of properties which might be usefulto man, and homoeopathic or imitative magic seeks to communicate these properties tohuman beings in various ways. Thus some Bechuanas wear a ferret as a charm, because,being very tenacious of life, it will make them difficult to kill. Others wear a certain insect,mutilated, but living, for a similar purpose. Yet other Bechuana warriors wear the hair of ahornless ox among their own hair, and the skin of a frog on their mantle, because a frog isslippery, and the ox, having no horns, is hard to catch; so the man who is provided with thesecharms believes that he will be as hard to hold as the ox and the frog. Again, it seems plainthat a South African warrior who twists tufts of rat’s hair among his own curly black locks willhave just as many chances of avoiding the enemy’s spear as the nimble rat has of avoidingthings thrown at it; hence in these regions rats’ hair is in great demand when war is expected.One of the ancient books of India prescribes that when a sacrifice is offered for victory, theearth out of which the altar is to be made should be taken from a place where a boar hasbeen wallowing, since the strength of the boar will be in that earth. When you are playing theone-stringed lute, and your fingers are stiff, the thing to do is to catch some long-legged fieldspiders and roast them, and then rub your fingers with the ashes; that will make your fingersas lithe and nimble as the spiders’ legs—at least so think the Galelareese. To bring back arunaway slave an Arab will trace a magic circle on the ground, stick a nail in the middle of it,and attach a beetle by a thread to the nail, taking care that the sex of the beetle is that of thefugitive. As the beetle crawls round and round, it will coil the thread about the nail, thus short-ening its tether and drawing nearer to the centre at every circuit. So by virtue of homoeopath-ic magic the runaway slave will be drawn back to his master.Among the western tribes of British New Guinea, a man who has killed a snake will burn itand smear his legs with the ashes when he goes into the forest; for no snake will bite him forsome days afterwards. If a South Slavonian has a mind to pilfer and steal at market, he hasnothing to do but to burn a blind cat, and then throw a pinch of its ashes over the person withwhom he is higgling; after that he can take what he likes from the booth, and the owner willnot be a bit the wiser, having become as blind as the deceased cat with whose ashes he hasbeen sprinkled. The thief may even ask boldly, “Did I pay for it?” and the deluded huckster willreply, “Why, certainly.” Equally simple and effectual is the expedient adopted by natives ofCentral Australia who desire to cultivate their beards. They prick the chin all over with a point-ed bone, and then stroke it carefully with a magic stick or stone, which represents a kind ofrat that has very long whiskers. The virtue of these whiskers naturally passes into the repre-sentative stick or stone, and thence by an easy transition to the chin, which, consequently, issoon adorned with a rich growth of beard. The ancient Greeks thought that to eat the flesh ofthe wakeful nightingale would prevent a man from sleeping; that to smear the eyes of a blear-sighted person with the gall of an eagle would give him the eagle’s vision; and that a raven’sPage 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"eggs would restore the blackness of the raven to silvery hair. Only the person who adoptedthis last mode of concealing the ravages of time had to be most careful to keep his mouth fullof oil all the time he applied the eggs to his venerable locks, else his teeth as well as his hairwould be dyed raven black, and no amount of scrubbing and scouring would avail to whitenthem again. The hair-restorer was in fact a shade too powerful, and in applying it you mightget more than you bargained for.The Huichol Indians admire the beautiful markings on the backs of serpents. Hence when aHuichol woman is about to weave or embroider, her husband catches a large serpent andholds it in a cleft stick, while the woman strokes the reptile with one hand down the wholelength of its back; then she passes the same hand over her forehead and eyes, that she maybe able to work as beautiful patterns in the web as the markings on the back of the serpent.On the principle of homoeopathic magic, inanimate things, as well as plants and animals,may diffuse blessing or bane around them, according to their own intrinsic nature and the skillof the wizard to tap or dam, as the case may be, the stream of weal or woe. In Samaracandwomen give a baby sugar candy to suck and put glue in the palm of its hand, in order that,when the child grows up, his words may be sweet and precious things may stick to his handsas if they were glued. The Greeks thought that a garment made from the fleece of a sheepthat had been torn by a wolf would hurt the wearer, setting up an itch or irritation in his skin.They were also of opinion that if a stone which had been bitten by a dog were dropped inwine, it would make all who drank of that wine to fall out among themselves. Among theArabs of Moab a childless woman often borrows the robe of a woman who has had manychildren, hoping with the robe to acquire the fruitfulness of its owner. The Caffres of Sofala, inEast Africa, had a great dread of being struck with anything hollow, such as a reed or a straw,and greatly preferred being thrashed with a good thick cudgel or an iron bar, even though ithurt very much. For they thought that if a man were beaten with anything hollow, his insidewould waste away till he died. In eastern seas there is a large shell which the Buginese ofCelebes call the “old man” (kadjâwo). On Fridays they turn these “old men” upside down andplace them on the thresholds of their houses, believing that whoever then steps over thethreshold of the house will live to be old. At initiation a Brahman boy is made to tread with hisright foot on a stone, while the words are repeated, “Tread on this stone; like a stone be firm”;and the same ceremony is performed, with the same words, by a Brahman bride at her mar-riage. In Madagascar a mode of counteracting the levity of fortune is to bury a stone at thefoot of the heavy house-post. The common custom of swearing upon a stone may be basedpartly on a belief that the strength and stability of the stone lend confirmation to an oath. Thusthe old Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus tells us that “the ancients, when they were tochoose a king, were wont to stand on stones planted in the ground, and to proclaim theirvotes, in order to foreshadow from the steadfastness of the stones that the deed would belasting.”But while a general magical efficacy may be supposed to reside in all stones by reason oftheir common properties of weight and solidity, special magical virtues are attributed to partic-ular stones, or kinds of stone, in accordance with their individual or specific qualities of shapeand colour. For example, the Indians of Peru employed certain stones for the increase ofmaize, others for the increase of potatoes, and others again for the increase of cattle. Thestones used to make maize grow were fashioned in the likeness of cobs of maize, and thestones destined to multiply cattle had the shape of sheep.In some parts of Melanesia a like belief prevails that certain sacred stones are endowed withPage 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"miraculous powers which correspond in their nature to the shape of the stone. Thus a pieceof water-worn coral on the beach often bears a surprising likeness to a bread-fruit. Hence inthe Banks Islands a man who finds such a coral will lay it at the root of one of his bread-fruittrees in the expectation that it will make the tree bear well. If the result answers his expecta-tion, he will then, for a proper remuneration, take stones of less-marked character from othermen and let them lie near his, in order to imbue them with the magic virtue which resides in it.Similarly, a stone with little discs upon it is good to bring in money; and if a man found a largestone with a number of small ones under it, like a sow among her litter, he was sure that tooffer money upon it would bring him pigs. In these and similar cases the Melanesians ascribethe marvellous power, not to the stone itself, but to its indwelling spirit; and sometimes, as wehave just seen, a man endeavours to propitiate the spirit by laying down offerings on thestone. But the conception of spirits that must be propitiated lies outside the sphere of magic,and within that of religion. Where such a conception is found, as here, in conjunction withpurely magical ideas and practices, the latter may generally be assumed to be the originalstock on which the religious conception has been at some later time engrafted. For there arestrong grounds for thinking that, in the evolution of thought, magic has preceded religion. Butto this point we shall return presently.The ancients set great store on the magical qualities of precious stones; indeed it has beenmaintained, with great show of reason, that such stoneswere used as amulets long before they were worn as mere ornaments. Thus the Greeks gavethe name of tree-agate to a stone which exhibits tree-like markings, and they thought that iftwo of these gems were tied to the horns or necks of oxen at the plough, the crop would besure to be plentiful. Again, they recognised a milk-stone which produced an abundant supplyof milk in women if only they drank it dissolved in honey-mead. Milk-stones are used for thesame purpose by Greek women in Crete and Melos at the present day; in Albania nursingmothers wear the stones in order to ensure an abundant flow of milk. Again, the Greeksbelieved in a stone which cured snake-bites, and hence was named the snake-stone; to testits efficacy you had only to grind the stone to powder and sprinkle the powder on the wound.The wine-coloured amethyst received its name, which means “not drunken,” because it wassupposed to keep the wearer of it sober; and two brothers who desired to live at unity wereadvised to carry magnets about with them, which, by drawing the twain together, would clear-ly prevent them from falling out.The ancient books of the Hindoos lay down a rule that after sunset on his marriage night aman should sit silent with his wife till the stars begin to twinkle in the sky. When the pole-starappears, he should point it out to her, and, addressing the star, say, “Firm art thou; I see thee,the firm one. Firm be thou with me, O thriving one!” Then, turning to his wife, he should say,“To me Brihaspati has given thee; obtaining offspring through me, thy husband, live with me ahundred autumns.” The intention of the ceremony is plainly to guard against the fickleness offortune and the instability of earthly bliss by the steadfast influence of the constant star. It isthe wish expressed in Keats’s last sonnet: Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art—Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night.Dwellers by the sea cannot fail to be impressed by the sight of its ceaseless ebb and flow,and are apt, on the principles of that rude philosophy of sympathy and resemblance whichhere engages our attention, to trace a subtle relation, a secret harmony, between its tides andthe life of man, of animals, and of plants. In the flowing tide they see not merely a symbol, butPage 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"a cause of exuberance, of prosperity, and of life, while in the ebbing tide they discern a realagent as well as a melancholy emblem of failure, of weakness, and of death. The Bretonpeasant fancies that clover sown when the tide is coming in will grow well, but that if the plantbe sown at low water or when the tide is going out, it will never reach maturity, and that thecows which feed on it will burst. His wife believes that the best butter is made when the tidehas just turned and is beginning to flow, that milk which foams in the churn will go on foamingtill the hour of high water is past, and that water drawn from the well or milk extracted fromthe cow while the tide is rising will boil up in the pot or saucepan and overflow into the fire.According to some of the ancients, the skins of seals, even after they had been parted fromtheir bodies, remained in secret sympathy with the sea, and were observed to ruffle when thetide was on the ebb. Another ancient belief, attributed to Aristotle, was that no creature candie except at ebb tide. The belief, if we can trust Pliny, was confirmed by experience, so faras regards human beings, on the coast of France. Philostratus also assures us that at Cadizdying people never yielded up the ghost while the water was high. A like fancy still lingers insome parts of Europe. On the Cantabrian coast they think that persons who die of chronic oracute disease expire at the moment when the tide begins to recede. In Portugal, all along thecoast of Wales, and on some parts of the coast of Brittany, a belief is said to prevail that peo-ple are born when the tide comes in, and die when it goes out. Dickens attests the existenceof the same superstition in England. “People can’t die, along the coast,” said Mr. Pegotty,“except when the tide’s pretty nigh out. They can’t be born, unless it’s pretty nigh in—notproperly born till flood.” The belief that most deaths happen at ebb tide is said to be heldalong the east coast of England from Northumberland to Kent. Shakespeare must have beenfamiliar with it, for he makes Falstaff die “even just between twelve and one, e’en at the turn-ing o’ the tide.” We meet the belief again on the Pacific coast of North America among theHaidas. Whenever a good Haida is about to die he sees a canoe manned by some of hisdead friends, who come with the tide to bid him welcome to the spirit land. “Come with usnow,” they say, “for the tide is about to ebb and we must depart.” At Port Stephens, in NewSouth Wales, the natives always buried their dead at flood tide, never at ebb, lest the retiringwater should bear the soul of the departed to some distant country.To ensure a long life the Chinese have recourse to certain complicated charms, which con-centrate in themselves the magical essence emanating, on homoeopathic principles, fromtimes and seasons, from persons and from things. The vehicles employed to transmit thesehappy influences are no other than grave-clothes. These are provided by many Chinese intheir lifetime, and most people have them cut out and sewn by an unmarried girl or a veryyoung woman, wisely calculating that, since such a person is likely to live a great many yearsto come, a part of her capacity to live long must surely pass into the clothes, and thus staveoff for many years the time when they shall be put to their proper use. Further, the garmentsare made by preference in a year which has an intercalary month; for to the Chinese mind itseems plain that grave-clothes made in a year which is unusually long will possess thecapacity of prolonging life in an unusually high degree. Amongst the clothes there is one robein particular on which special pains have been lavished to imbue it with this priceless quality.It is a long silken gown of the deepest blue colour, with the word “longevity” embroidered allover it in thread of gold. To present an aged parent with one of these costly and splendidmantles, known as “longevity garments,” is esteemed by the Chinese an act of filial piety anda delicate mark of attention. As the garment purports to prolong the life of its owner, he oftenwears it, especially on festive occasions, in order to allow the influence of longevity, createdby the many golden letters with which it is bespangled, to work their full effect upon his per-son. On his birthday, above all, he hardly ever fails to don it, for in China common sense bidsa man lay in a large stock of vital energy on his birthday, to be expended in the form of healthPage 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"and vigour during the rest of the year. Attired in the gorgeous pall, and absorbing its blessedinfluence at every pore, the happy owner receives complacently the congratulations of friendsand relations, who warmly express their admiration of these magnificent cerements, and ofthe filial piety which prompted the children to bestow so beautiful and useful a present on theauthor of their being.Another application of the maxim that like produces like is seen in the Chinese belief that thefortunes of a town are deeply affected by its shape, and that they must vary according to thecharacter of the thing which that shape most nearly resembles. Thus it is related that longago the town of Tsuen-cheu-fu, the outlines of which are like those of a carp, frequently fell aprey to the depredations of the neighbouring city of Yung-chun, which is shaped like a fishing-net, until the inhabitants of the former town conceived the plan of erecting two tall pagodas intheir midst. These pagodas, which still tower above the city of Tsuen-cheu-fu, have ever sinceexercised the happiest influence over its destiny by intercepting the imaginary net before itcould descend and entangle in its meshes the imaginary carp. Some forty years ago the wisemen of Shanghai were much exercised to discover the cause of a local rebellion. On carefulenquiry they ascertained that the rebellion was due to the shape of a large new temple whichhad most unfortunately been built in the shape of a tortoise, an animal of the very worst char-acter. The difficulty was serious, the danger was pressing; for to pull down the temple wouldhave been impious, and to let it stand as it was would be to court a succession of similar orworse disasters. However, the genius of the local professors of geomancy, rising to the occa-sion, triumphantly surmounted the difficulty and obviated the danger. By filling up two wells,which represented the eyes of the tortoise, they at once blinded that disreputable animal andrendered him incapable of doing further mischief.Sometimes homoeopathic or imitative magic is called in to annul an evil omen by accomplish-ing it in mimicry. The effect is to circumvent destiny by substituting a mock calamity for a realone. In Madagascar this mode of cheating the fates is reduced to a regular system. Hereevery man’s fortune is determined by the day or hour of his birth, and if that happens to be anunlucky one his fate is sealed, unless the mischief can be extracted, as the phrase goes, bymeans of a substitute. The ways of extracting the mischief are various. For example, if a manis born on the first day of the second month (February), his house will be burnt down when hecomes of age. To take time by the forelock and avoid this catastrophe, the friends of theinfant will set up a shed in a field or in the cattle-fold and burn it. If the ceremony is to be real-ly effective, the child and his mother should be placed in the shed and only plucked, likebrands, from the burning hut before it is too late. Again, dripping November is the month oftears, and he who is born in it is born to sorrow. But in order to disperse the clouds that thusgather over his future, he has nothing to do but to take the lid off a boiling pot and wave itabout. The drops that fall from it will accomplish his destiny and so prevent the tears fromtrickling from his eyes. Again, if fate has decreed that a young girl, still unwed, should see herchildren, still unborn, descend before her with sorrow to the grave, she can avert the calamityas follows. She kills a grasshopper, wraps it in a rag to represent a shroud, and mourns overit like Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted. Moreover, she takes adozen or more other grasshoppers, and having removed some of their superfluous legs andwings she lays them about their dead and shrouded fellow. The buzz of the tortured insectsand the agitated motions of their mutilated limbs represent the shrieks and contortions of themourners at a funeral. After burying the deceased grasshopper she leaves the rest to contin-ue their mourning till death releases them from their pain; and having bound up her dishev-elled hair she retires from the grave with the step and carriage of a person plunged in grief.Thenceforth she looks cheerfully forward to seeing her children survive her; for it cannot bePage 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"that she should mourn and bury them twice over. Once more, if fortune has frowned on aman at his birth and penury has marked him for her own, he can easily erase the mark inquestion by purchasing a couple of cheap pearls, price three halfpence, and burying them.For who but the rich of this world can thus afford to fling pearls away?3. CONTAGIOUS MAGICThus far we have been considering chiefly that branch of sympathetic magic which may becalled homoeopathic or imitative. Its leading principle, as we have seen, is that like produceslike, or, in other words, that an effect resembles its cause. The other great branch of sympa-thetic magic, which I have called Contagious Magic, proceeds upon the notion that thingswhich have once been conjoined must remain ever afterwards, even when quite disseveredfrom each other, in such a sympathetic relation that whatever is done to the one must similar-ly affect the other. Thus the logical basis of Contagious Magic, like that of HomoeopathicMagic, is a mistaken association of ideas; its physical basis, if we may speak of such a thing,like the physical basis of Homoeopathic Magic, is a material medium of some sort which, likethe ether of modern physics, is assumed to unite distant objects and to convey impressionsfrom one to the other. The most familiar example of Contagious Magic is the magical sympa-thy which is supposed to exist between a man and any severed portion of his person, as hishair or nails; so that whoever gets possession of human hair or nails may work his will, at anydistance, upon the person from whom they were cut. This superstition is world-wide;instances of it in regard to hair and nails will be noticed later on in this work.Among the Australian tribes it was a common practice to knock out one or more of a boy’sfront teeth at those ceremonies of initiation to which every male member had to submit beforehe could enjoy the rights and privileges of a full-grown man. The reason of the practice isobscure; all that concerns us here is the belief that a sympathetic relation continued to existbetween the lad and his teeth after the latter had been extracted from his gums. Thus amongsome of the tribes about the river Darling, in New South Wales, the extracted tooth wasplaced under the bark of a tree near a river or water-hole; if the bark grew over the tooth, or ifthe tooth fell into the water, all was well; but if it were exposed and the ants ran over it, thenatives believed that the boy would suffer from a disease of the mouth. Among the Murringand other tribes of New South Wales the extracted tooth was at first taken care of by an oldman, and then passed from one headman to another, until it had gone all round the communi-ty, when it came back to the lad’s father, and finally to the lad himself. But however it wasthus conveyed from hand to hand, it might on no account be placed in a bag containing magi-cal substances, for to do so would, they believed, put the owner of the tooth in great danger.The late Dr. Howitt once acted as custodian of the teeth which had been extracted from somenovices at a ceremony of initiation, and the old men earnestly besought him not to carry themin a bag in which they knew that he had some quartz crystals. They declared that if he did sothe magic of the crystals would pass into the teeth, and so injure the boys. Nearly a year afterDr. Howitt’s return from the ceremony he was visited by one of the principal men of theMurring tribe, who had travelled some two hundred and fifty miles from his home to fetchback the teeth. This man explained that he had been sent for them because one of the boyshad fallen into ill health, and it was believed that the teeth had received some injury whichhad affected him. He was assured that the teeth had been kept in a box apart from any sub-stances, like quartz crystals, which could influence them; and he returned home bearing theteeth with him carefully wrapt up and concealed.The Basutos are careful to conceal their extracted teeth, lest these should fall into the handsPage 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"of certain mythical beings who haunt graves, and who could harm the owner of the tooth byworking magic on it. In Sussex some fifty years ago a maid-servant remonstrated stronglyagainst the throwing away of children’s cast teeth, affirming that should they be found andgnawed by any animal, the child’s new tooth would be, for all the world, like the teeth of theanimal that had bitten the old one. In proof of this she named old Master Simmons, who hada very large pig’s tooth in his upper jaw, a personal defect that he always averred was causedby his mother, who threw away one of his cast teeth by accident into the hog’s trough. A simi-lar belief has led to practices intended, on the principles of homoeopathic magic, to replaceold teeth by new and better ones. Thus in many parts of the world it is customary to putextracted teeth in some place where they will be found by a mouse or a rat, in the hope that,through the sympathy which continues to subsist between them and their former owner, hisother teeth may acquire the same firmness and excellence as the teeth of these rodents. Forexample, in Germany it is said to be an almost universal maxim among the people that whenyou have had a tooth taken out you should insert it in a mouse’s hole. To do so with a child’smilk-tooth which has fallen out will prevent the child from having toothache. Or you should gobehind the stove and throw your tooth backwards over your head, saying “Mouse, give meyour iron tooth; I will give you my bone tooth.” After that your other teeth will remain good. Faraway from Europe, at Raratonga, in the Pacific, when a child’s tooth was extracted, the fol-lowing prayer used to be recited: “Big rat! little rat! Here is my old tooth. Pray give me a new one.” Then the tooth was thrown on the thatch of the house, because rats make their nests in thedecayed thatch. The reason assigned for invoking the rats on these occasions was that rats’teeth were the strongest known to the natives.Other parts which are commonly believed to remain in a sympathetic union with the body,after the physical connexion has been severed, are the navel-string and the afterbirth, includ-ing the placenta. So intimate, indeed, is the union conceived to be, that the fortunes of theindividual for good or evil throughout life are often supposed to be bound up with one or otherof these portions of his person, so that if his navel-string or afterbirth is preserved and proper-ly treated, he will be prosperous; whereas if it be injured or lost, he will suffer accordingly.Thus certain tribes of Western Australia believe that a man swims well or ill, according as hismother at his birth threw the navel-string into water or not. Among the natives on thePennefather River in Queensland it is believed that a part of the child’s spirit (cho-i) stays inthe afterbirth. Hence the grandmother takes the afterbirth away and buries it in the sand. Shemarks the spot by a number of twigs which she sticks in the ground in a circle, tying their topstogether so that the structure resembles a cone. When Anjea, the being who causes concep-tion in women by putting mud babies into their wombs, comes along and sees the place, hetakes out the spirit and carries it away to one of his haunts, such as a tree, a hole in a rock,or a lagoon where it may remain for years. But sometime or other he will put the spirit againinto a baby, and it will be born once more into the world. In Ponape, one of the CarolineIslands, the navel-string is placed in a shell and then disposed of in such a way as shall bestadapt the child for the career which the parents have chosen for him; for example, if theywish to make him a good climber, they will hang the navel-string on a tree. The Kei islandersregard the navel-string as the brother or sister of the child, according to the sex of the infant.They put it in a pot with ashes, and set it in the branches of a tree, that it may keep a watch-ful eye on the fortunes of its comrade. Among the Bataks of Sumatra, as among many otherPage 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"peoples of the Indian Archipelago, the placenta passes for the child’s younger brother or sis-ter, the sex being determined by the sex of the child, and it is buried under the house.According to the Bataks it is bound up with the child’s welfare, and seems, in fact, to be theseat of the transferable soul, of which we shall hear something later on. The Karo Batakseven affirm that of a man’s two souls it is the true soul that lives with the placenta under thehouse; that is the soul, they say, which begets children.The Baganda believe that every person is born with a double, and this double they identifywith the afterbirth, which they regard as a second child. The mother buries the afterbirth atthe root of a plantain tree, which then becomes sacred until the fruit has ripened, when it isplucked to furnish a sacred feast for the family. Among the Cherokees the navel-string of agirl is buried under a corn-mortar, in order that the girl may grow up to be a good baker; butthe navel-string of a boy is hung up on a tree in the woods, in order that he may be a hunter.The Incas of Peru preserved the navel-string with the greatest care, and gave it to the child tosuck whenever it fell ill. In ancient Mexico they used to give a boy’s navel-string to soldiers, tobe buried by them on a field of battle, in order that the boy might thus acquire a passion forwar. But the navel-string of a girl was buried beside the domestic hearth, because this wasbelieved to inspire her with a love of home and taste for cooking and baking.Even in Europe many people still believe that a person’s destiny is more or less bound upwith that of his navel-string or afterbirth. Thus in Rhenish Bavaria the navel-string is kept for awhile wrapt up in a piece of old linen, and then cut or pricked to pieces according as the childis a boy or a girl, in order that he or she may grow up to be a skilful workman or a goodsempstress. In Berlin the midwife commonly delivers the dried navel-string to the father with astrict injunction to preserve it carefully, for so long as it is kept the child will live and thrive andbe free from sickness. In Beauce and Perche the people are careful to throw the navel-stringneither into water nor into fire, believing that if that were done the child would be drowned orburned.Thus in many parts of the world the navel-string, or more commonly the afterbirth, is regardedas a living being, the brother or sister of the infant, or as the material object in which theguardian spirit of the child or part of its soul resides. Further, the sympathetic connexion sup-posed to exist between a person and his afterbirth or navel-string comes out very clearly inthe widespread custom of treating the afterbirth or navel-string in ways which are supposed toinfluence for life the character and career of the person, making him, if it is a man, a nimbleclimber, a strong swimmer, a skilful hunter, or a brave soldier, and making her, if it is awoman, a cunning sempstress, a good baker, and so forth. Thus the beliefs and usages con-cerned with the afterbirth or placenta, and to a less extent with the navel-string, present aremarkable parallel to the widespread doctrine of the transferable or external soul and thecustoms founded on it. Hence it is hardly rash to conjecture that the resemblance is no merechance coincidence, but that in the afterbirth or placenta we have a physical basis (not nec-essarily the only one) for the theory and practice of the external soul. The consideration ofthat subject is reserved for a later part of this work.Acurious application of the doctrine of contagious magic is the relation commonly believed toexist between a wounded man and the agent of the wound, so that whatever is subsequentlydone by or to the agent must correspondingly affect the patient either for good or evil. ThusPliny tells us that if you have wounded a man and are sorry for it, you have only to spit on thehand that gave the wound, and the pain of the sufferer will be instantly alleviated. InMelanesia, if a man’s friends get possession of the arrow which wounded him, they keep it inPage 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"a damp place or in cool leaves, for then the inflammation will be trifling and will soon subside.Meantime the enemy who shot the arrow is hard at work to aggravate the wound by all themeans in his power. For this purpose he and his friends drink hot and burning juices andchew irritating leaves, for this will clearly inflame and irritate the wound. Further, they keep thebow near the fire to make the wound which it has inflicted hot; and for the same reason theyput the arrow-head, if it has been recovered, into the fire. Moreover, they are careful to keepthe bow-string taut and to twang it occasionally, for this will cause the wounded man to sufferfrom tension of the nerves and spasms of tetanus. “It is constantly received and avouched,”says Bacon, “that the anointing of the weapon that maketh the wound will heal the wounditself. In this experiment, upon the relation of men of credit (though myself, as yet, am notfully inclined to believe it), you shall note the points following: first, the ointment wherewiththis is done is made of divers ingredients, whereof the strangest and hardest to come by arethe moss upon the skull of a dead man unburied, and the fats of a boar and a bear killed inthe act of generation.” The precious ointment compounded out of these and other ingredientswas applied, as the philosopher explains, not to the wound but to the weapon, and that eventhough the injured man was at a great distance and knew nothing about it. The experiment,he tells us, had been tried of wiping the ointment off the weapon without the knowledge of theperson hurt, with the result that he was presently in a great rage of pain until the weapon wasanointed again. Moreover, “it is affirmed that if you cannot get the weapon, yet if you put aninstrument of iron or wood resembling the weapon into the wound, whereby it bleedeth, theanointing of that instrument will serve and work the effect.” Remedies of the sort which Bacondeemed worthy of his attention are still in vogue in the eastern counties of England. Thus inSuffolk if a man cuts himself with a bill-hook or a scythe he always takes care to keep theweapon bright, and oils it to prevent the wound from festering. If he runs a thorn or, as hecalls it, a bush into his hand, he oils or greases the extracted thorn. A man came to a doctorwith an inflamed hand, having run a thorn into it while he was hedging. On being told that thehand was festering, he remarked, “That didn’t ought to, for I greased the bush well after Ipulled it out.” If a horse wounds its foot by treading on a nail, a Suffolk groom will invariablypreserve the nail, clean it, and grease it every day, to prevent the foot from festering. SimilarlyCambridgeshire labourers think that if a horse has run a nail into its foot, it is necessary togrease the nail with lard or oil and put it away in some safe place, or the horse will not recov-er. A few years ago a veterinary surgeon was sent for to attend a horse which had ripped itsside open on the hinge of a farm gatepost. On arriving at the farm he found that nothing hadbeen done for the wounded horse, but that a man was busy trying to pry the hinge out of thegatepost in order that it might be greased and put away, which, in the opinion of theCambridge wiseacres, would conduce to the recovery of the animal. Similarly Essex rusticsopine that, if a man has been stabbed with a knife, it is essential to his recovery that the knifeshould be greased and laid across the bed on which the sufferer is lying. So in Bavaria youare directed to anoint a linen rag with grease and tie it on the edge of the axe that cut you,taking care to keep the sharp edge upwards. As the grease on the axe dries, your woundheals. Similarly in the Harz Mountains they say that if you cut yourself, you ought to smearthe knife or the scissors with fat and put the instrument away in a dry place in the name ofthe Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. As the knife dries, the wound heals. Other peo-ple, however, in Germany say that you should stick the knife in some damp place in theground, and that your hurt will heal as the knife rusts. Others again, in Bavaria, recommendyou to smear the axe or whatever it is with blood and put it under the eaves.The train of reasoning which thus commends itself to English and German rustics, in commonwith the savages of Melanesia and America, is carried a step further by the aborigines ofCentral Australia, who conceive that under certain circumstances the near relations of aPage 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"wounded man must grease themselves, restrict their diet, and regulate their behaviour inother ways in order to ensure his recovery. Thus when a lad has been circumcised and thewound is not yet healed, his mother may not eat opossum, or a certain kind of lizard, or car-pet snake, or any kind of fat, for otherwise she would retard the healing of the boy’s wound.Every day she greases her digging-sticks and never lets them out of her sight; at night shesleeps with them close to her head. No one is allowed to touch them. Every day also sherubs her body all over with grease, as in some way this is believed to help her son’s recovery.Another refinement of the same principle is due to the ingenuity of the German peasant. It issaid that when one of his pigs or sheep breaks its leg, a farmer of Rhenish Bavaria or Hessewill bind up the leg of a chair with bandages and splints in due form. For some days there-after no one may sit on that chair, move it, or knock up against it; for to do so would pain theinjured pig or sheep and hinder the cure. In this last case it is clear that we have passedwholly out of the region of contagious magic and into the region of homoeopathic or imitativemagic; the chair-leg, which is treated instead of the beast’s leg, in no sense belongs to theanimal, and the application of bandages to it is a mere simulation of the treatment which amore rational surgery would bestow on the real patient.The sympathetic connexion supposed to exist between a man and the weapon which haswounded him is probably founded on the notion that the blood on the weapon continues tofeel with the blood in his body. For a like reason the Papuans of Tumleo, an island off NewGuinea, are careful to throw into the sea the bloody bandages with which their wounds havebeen dressed, for they fear that if these rags fell into the hands of an enemy he might injurethem magically thereby. Once when a man with a wound in his mouth, which bled constantly,came to the missionaries to be treated, his faithful wife took great pains to collect all the bloodand cast it into the sea. Strained and unnatural as this idea may seem to us, it is perhapsless so than the belief that magic sympathy is maintained between a person and his clothes,so that whatever is done to the clothes will be felt by the man himself, even though he maybe far away at the time. In the Wotjobaluk tribe of Victoria a wizard would sometimes get holdof a man’s opossum rug and roast it slowly in the fire, and as he did so the owner of the rugwould fall sick. If the wizard consented to undo the charm, he would give the rug back to thesick man’s friends, bidding them put it in water, “so as to wash the fire out.” When that hap-pened, the sufferer would feel a refreshing coolness and probably recover. In Tanna, one ofthe New Hebrides, a man who had a grudge at another and desired his death would try to getpossession of a cloth which had touched the sweat of his enemy’s body. If he succeeded, herubbed the cloth carefully over with the leaves and twigs of a certain tree, rolled and boundcloth, twigs, and leaves into a long sausage-shaped bundle, and burned it slowly in the fire.As the bundle was consumed, the victim fell ill, and when it was reduced to ashes, he died. Inthis last form of enchantment, however, the magical sympathy may be supposed to exist notso much between the man and the cloth as between the man and the sweat which issuedfrom his body. But in other cases of the same sort it seems that the garment by itself isenough to give the sorcerer a hold upon his victim. The witch in Theocritus, while she meltedan image or lump of wax in order that her faithless lover might melt with love of her, did notforget to throw into the fire a shred of his cloak which he had dropped in her house. InPrussia they say that if you cannot catch a thief, the next best thing you can do is to get holdof a garment which he may have shed in his flight; for if you beat it soundly, the thief will fallsick. This belief is firmly rooted in the popular mind. Some eighty or ninety years ago, in theneighbourhood of Berend, a man was detected trying to steal honey, and fled, leaving hiscoat behind him. When he heard that the enraged owner of the honey was mauling his lostcoat, he was so alarmed that he took to his bed and died.Page 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Again, magic may be wrought on a man sympathetically, not only through his clothes andsevered parts of himself, but also through the impressions left by his body in sand or earth. Inparticular, it is a world-wide superstition that by injuring footprints you injure the feet thatmade them. Thus the natives of South-eastern Australia think that they can lame a man byplacing sharp pieces of quartz, glass, bone, or charcoal in his footprints. Rheumatic pains areoften attributed by them to this cause. Seeing a Tatungolung man very lame, Mr. Howitt askedhim what was the matter. He said, “some fellow has put bottle in my foot.” He was sufferingfrom rheumatism, but believed that an enemy had found his foot-track and had buried it in apiece of broken bottle, the magical influence of which had entered his foot.Similar practices prevail in various parts of Europe. Thus in Mecklenburg it is thought that ifyou drive a nail into a man’s footprint he will fall lame; sometimes it is required that the nailshould be taken from a coffin. A like mode of injuring an enemy is resorted to in some parts ofFrance. It is said that there was an old woman who used to frequent Stow in Suffolk, and shewas a witch. If, while she walked, any one went after her and stuck a nail or a knife into herfootprint in the dust, the dame could not stir a step till it was withdrawn. Among the SouthSlavs a girl will dig up the earth from the footprints of the man she loves and put it in a flower-pot. Then she plants in the pot a marigold, a flower that is thought to be fadeless. And as itsgolden blossom grows and blooms and never fades, so shall her sweetheart’s love grow andbloom, and never, never fade. Thus the love-spell acts on the man through the earth he trodon. An old Danish mode of concluding a treaty was based on the same idea of the sympa-thetic connexion between a man and his footprints: the covenanting parties sprinkled eachother’s footprints with their own blood, thus giving a pledge of fidelity. In ancient Greecesuperstitions of the same sort seem to have been current, for it was thought that if a horsestepped on the track of a wolf he was seized with numbness; and a maxim ascribed toPythagoras forbade people to pierce a man’s footprints with a nail or a knife.The same superstition is turned to account by hunters in many parts of the world for the pur-pose of running down the game. Thus a German huntsman will stick a nail taken from a coffininto the fresh spoor of the quarry, believing that this will hinder the animal from escaping. Theaborigines of Victoria put hot embers in the tracks of the animals they were pursuing.Hottentot hunters throw into the air a handful of sand taken from the footprints of the game,believing that this will bring the animal down. Thompson Indians used to lay charms on thetracks of wounded deer; after that they deemed it superfluous to pursue the animal any fur-ther that day, for being thus charmed it could not travel far and would soon die. Similarly,Ojebway Indians placed “medicine” on the track of the first deer or bear they met with, sup-posing that this would soon bring the animal into sight, even if it were two or three days’ jour-ney off; for this charm had power to compress a journey of several days into a few hours.Ewe hunters of West Africa stab the footprints of game with a sharp-pointed stick in order tomaim the quarry and allow them to come up with it.But though the footprint is the most obvious it is not the only impression made by the bodythrough which magic may be wrought on a man. The aborigines of South-eastern Australiabelieve that a man may be injured by burying sharp fragments of quartz, glass, and so forth inthe mark made by his reclining body; the magical virtue of these sharp things enters his bodyand causes those acute pains which the ignorant European puts down to rheumatism. Wecan now understand why it was a maxim with the Pythagoreans that in rising from bed youshould smooth away the impression left by your body on the bed-clothes. The rule was simplyan old precaution against magic, forming part of a whole code of superstitious maxims whichantiquity fathered on Pythagoras, though doubtless they were familiar to the barbarous forefa-Page 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"thers of the Greeks long before the time of that philosopher.4. THE MAGICIAN’S PROGRESSWe have now concluded our examination of the general principles of sympathetic magic. Theexamples by which I have illustrated them have been drawn for the most part from what maybe called private magic, that is from magical rites and incantations practised for the benefit orthe injury of individuals. But in savage society there is commonly to be found in addition whatwe may call public magic, that is, sorcery practised for the benefit of the whole community.Wherever ceremonies of this sort are observed for the common good, it is obvious that themagician ceases to be merely a private practitioner and becomes to some extent a publicfunctionary. The development of such a class of functionaries is of great importance for thepolitical as well as the religious evolution of society. For when the welfare of the tribe is sup-posed to depend on the performance of these magical rites, the magician rises into a positionof much influence and repute, and may readily acquire the rank and authority of a chief orking. The profession accordingly draws into its ranks some of the ablest and most ambitiousmen of the tribe, because it holds out to them a prospect of honour, wealth, and power suchas hardly any other career could offer. The acuter minds perceive how easy it is to dupe theirweaker brother and to play on his superstition for their own advantage. Not that the sorcereris always a knave and impostor; he is often sincerely convinced that he really possessesthose wonderful powers which the credulity of his fellows ascribes to him. But the more saga-cious he is, the more likely he is to see through the fallacies which impose on duller wits.Thus the ablest members of the profession must tend to be more or less consciousdeceivers; and it is just these men who in virtue of their superior ability will generally come tothe top and win for themselves positions of the highest dignity and the most commandingauthority. The pitfalls which beset the path of the professional sorcerer are many, and as arule only the man of coolest head and sharpest wit will be able to steer his way through themsafely. For it must always be remembered that every single profession and claim put forwardby the magician as such is false; not one of them can be maintained without deception, con-scious or unconscious. Accordingly the sorcerer who sincerely believes in his own extrava-gant pretensions is in far greater peril and is much more likely to be cut short in his careerthan the deliberate impostor. The honest wizard always expects that his charms and incanta-tions will produce their supposed effect; and when they fail, not only really, as they always do,but conspicuously and disastrously, as they often do, he is taken aback: he is not, like hisknavish colleague, ready with a plausible excuse to account for the failure, and before he canfind one he may be knocked on the head by his disappointed and angry employers.The general result is that at this stage of social evolution the supreme power tends to fall intothe hands of men of the keenest intelligence and the most unscrupulous character. If wecould balance the harm they do by their knavery against the benefits they confer by theirsuperior sagacity, it might well be found that the good greatly outweighed the evil. For moremischief has probably been wrought in the world by honest fools in high places than by intelli-gent rascals. Once your shrewd rogue has attained the height of his ambition, and has nolonger any selfish end to further, he may, and often does, turn his talents, his experience, hisresources, to the service of the public. Many men who have been least scrupulous in theacquisition of power have been most beneficent in the use of it, whether the power theyaimed at and won was that of wealth, political authority, or what not. In the field of politics thewily intriguer, the ruthless victor, may end by being a wise and magnanimous ruler, blessed inhis lifetime, lamented at his death, admired and applauded by posterity. Such men, to taketwo of the most conspicuous instances, were Julius Caesar and Augustus. But once a foolPage 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"always a fool, and the greater the power in his hands the more disastrous is likely to be theuse he makes of it. The heaviest calamity in English history, the breach with America, mightnever have occurred if George the Third had not been an honest dullard.Thus, so far as the public profession of magic affected the constitution of savage society, ittended to place the control of affairs in the hands of the ablest man: it shifted the balance ofpower from the many to the one: it substituted a monarchy for a democracy, or rather for anoligarchy of old men; for in general the savage community is ruled, not by the whole body ofadult males, but by a council of elders. The change, by whatever causes produced, and what-ever the character of the early rulers, was on the whole very beneficial. For the rise of monar-chy appears to be an essential condition of the emergence of mankind from savagery. Nohuman being is so hide-bound by custom and tradition as your democratic savage; in no stateof society consequently is progress so slow and difficult. The old notion that the savage is thefreest of mankind is the reverse of the truth. He is a slave, not indeed to a visible master, butto the past, to the spirits of his dead forefathers, who haunt his steps from birth to death, andrule him with a rod of iron. What they did is the pattern of right, the unwritten law to which heyields a blind unquestioning obedience. The least possible scope is thus afforded to superiortalent to change old customs for the better. The ablest man is dragged down by the weakestand dullest, who necessarily sets the standard, since he cannot rise, while the other can fall.The surface of such a society presents a uniform dead level, so far as it is humanly possibleto reduce the natural inequalities, the immeasurable real differences of inborn capacity andtemper, to a false superficial appearance of equality. From this low and stagnant condition ofaffairs, which demagogues and dreamers in later times have lauded as the ideal state, theGolden Age, of humanity, everything that helps to raise society by opening a career to talentand proportioning the degrees of authority to men’s natural abilities, deserves to be welcomedby all who have the real good of their fellows at heart. Once these elevating influences havebegun to operate—and they cannot be for ever suppressed—the progress of civilisationbecomes comparatively rapid. The rise of one man to supreme power enables him to carrythrough changes in a single lifetime which previously many generations might not have suf-ficed to effect; and if, as will often happen, he is a man of intellect and energy above the com-mon, he will readily avail himself of the opportunity. Even the whims and caprices of a tyrantmay be of service in breaking the chain of custom which lies so heavy on the savage. And assoon as the tribe ceases to be swayed by the timid and divided counsels of the elders, andyields to the direction of a single strong and resolute mind, it becomes formidable to its neigh-bours and enters on a career of aggrandisement, which at an early stage of history is oftenhighly favourable to social, industrial, and intellectual progress. For extending its sway, partlyby force of arms, partly by the voluntary submission of weaker tribes, the community soonacquires wealth and slaves, both of which, by relieving some classes from the perpetualstruggle for a bare subsistence, afford them an opportunity of devoting themselves to that dis-interested pursuit of knowledge which is the noblest and most powerful instrument to amelio-rate the lot of man.Intellectual progress, which reveals itself in the growth of art and science and the spread ofmore liberal views, cannot be dissociated from industrial or economic progress, and that in itsturn receives an immense impulse from conquest and empire. It is no mere accident that themost vehement outbursts of activity of the human mind have followed close on the heels ofvictory, and that the great conquering races of the world have commonly done most toadvance and spread civilisation, thus healing in peace the wounds they inflicted in war. TheBabylonians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Arabs are our witnesses in the past: we may yetlive to see a similar outburst in Japan. Nor, to remount the stream of history to its sources, isPage 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"it an accident that all the first great strides towards civilisation have been made under despot-ic and theocratic governments, like those of Egypt, Babylon, and Peru, where the supremeruler claimed and received the servile allegiance of his subjects in the double character of aking and a god. It is hardly too much to say that at this early epoch despotism is the bestfriend of humanity and, paradoxical as it may sound, of liberty. For after all there is more liber-ty in the best sense—liberty to think our own thoughts and to fashion our own destinies—under the most absolute despotism, the most grinding tyranny, than under the apparent free-dom of savage life, where the individual’s lot is cast from the cradle to the grave in the ironmould of hereditary custom.So far, therefore, as the public profession of magic has been one of the roads by which theablest men have passed to supreme power, it has contributed to emancipate mankind fromthe thraldom of tradition and to elevate them into a larger, freer life, with a broader outlook onthe world. This is no small service rendered to humanity. And when we remember further thatin another direction magic has paved the way for science, we are forced to admit that if theblack art has done much evil, it has also been the source of much good; that if it is the childof error, it has yet been the mother of freedom and truth.Chapter IVMagic and ReligionTHE examples collected in the last chapter may suffice to illustrate the general principles ofsympathetic magic in its two branches, to which we have given the names of Homoeopathicand Contagious respectively. In some cases of magic which have come before us we haveseen that the operation of spirits is assumed, and that an attempt is made to win their favourby prayer and sacrifice. But these cases are on the whole exceptional; they exhibit magictinged and alloyed with religion. Wherever sympathetic magic occurs in its pure unadulteratedform, it assumes that in nature one event follows another necessarily and invariably withoutthe intervention of any spiritual or personal agency. Thus its fundamental conception is identi-cal with that of modern science; underlying the whole system is a faith, implicit but real andfirm, in the order and uniformity of nature. The magician does not doubt that the same causeswill always produce the same effects, that the performance of the proper ceremony, accompa-nied by the appropriate spell, will inevitably be attended by the desired result, unless, indeed,his incantations should chance to be thwarted and foiled by the more potent charms of anoth-er sorcerer. He supplicates no higher power: he sues the favour of no fickle and waywardbeing: he abases himself before no awful deity. Yet his power, great as he believes it to be, isby no means arbitrary and unlimited. He can wield it only so long as he strictly conforms tothe rules of his art, or to what may be called the laws of nature as conceived by him. To neg-lect these rules, to break these laws in the smallest particular, is to incur failure, and mayeven expose the unskilful practitioner himself to the utmost peril. If he claims a sovereigntyover nature, it is a constitutional sovereignty rigorously limited in its scope and exercised inexact conformity with ancient usage. Thus the analogy between the magical and the scientificconceptions of the world is close. In both of them the succession of events is assumed to beperfectly regular and certain, being determined by immutable laws, the operation of which canbe foreseen and calculated precisely; the elements of caprice, of chance, and of accident arebanished from the course of nature. Both of them open up a seemingly boundless vista ofpossibilities to him who knows the causes of things and can touch the secret springs that setin motion the vast and intricate mechanism of the world. Hence the strong attraction whichmagic and science alike have exercised on the human mind; hence the powerful stimulus thatboth have given to the pursuit of knowledge. They lure the weary enquirer, the footsore seek-Page 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"er, on through the wilderness of disappointment in the present by their endless promises ofthe future: they take him up to the top of an exceeding high mountain and show him, beyondthe dark clouds and rolling mists at his feet, a vision of the celestial city, far off, it may be, butradiant with unearthly splendour, bathed in the light of dreams.The fatal flaw of magic lies not in its general assumption of a sequence of events determinedby law, but in its total misconception of the nature of the particular laws which govern thatsequence. If we analyse the various cases of sympathetic magic which have been passed inreview in the preceding pages, and which may be taken as fair samples of the bulk, we shallfind, as I have already indicated, that they are all mistaken applications of one or other of twogreat fundamental laws of thought, namely, the association of ideas by similarity and theassociation of ideas by contiguity in space or time. A mistaken association of similar ideasproduces homoeopathic or imitative magic: a mistaken association of contiguous ideas pro-duces contagious magic. The principles of association are excellent in themselves, andindeed absolutely essential to the working of the human mind. Legitimately applied they yieldscience; illegitimately applied they yield magic, the bastard sister of science. It is therefore atruism, almost a tautology, to say that all magic is necessarily false and barren; for were itever to become true and fruitful, it would no longer be magic but science. From the earliesttimes man has been engaged in a search for general rules whereby to turn the order of natu-ral phenomena to his own advantage, and in the long search he has scraped together a greathoard of such maxims, some of them golden and some of them mere dross. The true or gold-en rules constitute the body of applied science which we call the arts; the false are magic.If magic is thus next of kin to science, we have still to enquire how it stands related to reli-gion. But the view we take of that relation will necessarily be coloured by the idea which wehave formed of the nature of religion itself; hence a writer may reasonably be expected todefine his conception of religion before he proceeds to investigate its relation to magic. Thereis probably no subject in the world about which opinions differ so much as the nature of reli-gion, and to frame a definition of it which would satisfy every one must obviously be impossi-ble. All that a writer can do is, first, to say clearly what he means by religion, and afterwardsto employ the word consistently in that sense throughout his work. By religion, then, I under-stand a propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man which are believed to direct andcontrol the course of nature and of human life. Thus defined, religion consists of two ele-ments, a theoretical and a practical, namely, a belief in powers higher than man and anattempt to propitiate or please them. Of the two, belief clearly comes first, since we mustbelieve in the existence of a divine being before we can attempt to please him. But unless thebelief leads to a corresponding practice, it is not a religion but merely a theology; in the lan-guage of St. James, “faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.” In other words, no manis religious who does not govern his conduct in some measure by the fear or love of God. Onthe other hand, mere practice, divested of all religious belief, is also not religion. Two menmay behave in exactly the same way, and yet one of them may be religious and the other not.If the one acts from the love or fear of God, he is religious; if the other acts from the love orfear of man, he is moral or immoral according as his behaviour comports or conflicts with thegeneral good. Hence belief and practice or, in theological language, faith and works areequally essential to religion, which cannot exist without both of them. But it is not necessarythat religious practice should always take the form of a ritual; that is, it need not consist in theoffering of sacrifice, the recitation of prayers, and other outward ceremonies. Its aim is toplease the deity, and if the deity is one who delights in charity and mercy and purity morethan in oblations of blood, the chanting of hymns, and the fumes of incense, his worshipperswill best please him, not by prostrating themselves before him, by intoning his praises, and byPage 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"filling his temples with costly gifts, but by being pure and merciful and charitable towardsmen, for in so doing they will imitate, so far as human infirmity allows, the perfections of thedivine nature. It was this ethical side of religion which the Hebrew prophets, inspired with anoble ideal of God’s goodness and holiness, were never weary of inculcating. Thus Micahsays: “He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee,but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?” And at a later timemuch of the force by which Christianity conquered the world was drawn from the same highconception of God’s moral nature and the duty laid on men of conforming themselves to it.“Pure religion and undefiled,” says St. James, “before God and the Father is this, To visit thefatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.”But if religion involves, first, a belief in superhuman beings who rule the world, and, second,an attempt to win their favour, it clearly assumes that the course of nature is to some extentelastic or variable, and that we can persuade or induce the mighty beings who control it todeflect, for our benefit, the current of events from the channel in which they would otherwiseflow. Now this implied elasticity or variability of nature is directly opposed to the principles ofmagic as well as of science, both of which assume that the processes of nature are rigid andinvariable in their operation, and that they can as little be turned from their course by persua-sion and entreaty as by threats and intimidation. The distinction between the two conflictingviews of the universe turns on their answer to the crucial question, Are the forces which gov-ern the world conscious and personal, or unconscious and impersonal? Religion, as a concili-ation of the superhuman powers, assumes the former member of the alternative. For all con-ciliation implies that the being conciliated is a conscious or personal agent, that his conduct isin some measure uncertain, and that he can be prevailed upon to vary it in the desired direc-tion by a judicious appeal to his interests, his appetites, or his emotions. Conciliation is neveremployed towards things which are regarded as inanimate, nor towards persons whosebehaviour in the particular circumstances is known to be determined with absolute certainty.Thus in so far as religion assumes the world to be directed by conscious agents who may beturned from their purpose by persuasion, it stands in fundamental antagonism to magic aswell as to science, both of which take for granted that the course of nature is determined, notby the passions or caprice of personal beings, but by the operation of immutable laws actingmechanically. In magic, indeed, the assumption is only implicit, but in science it is explicit. It istrue that magic often deals with spirits, which are personal agents of the kind assumed byreligion; but whenever it does so in its proper form, it treats them exactly in the same fashionas it treats inanimate agents, that is, it constrains or coerces instead of conciliating or propiti-ating them as religion would do. Thus it assumes that all personal beings, whether human ordivine, are in the last resort subject to those impersonal forces which control all things, butwhich nevertheless can be turned to account by any one who knows how to manipulate themby the appropriate ceremonies and spells. In ancient Egypt, for example, the magiciansclaimed the power of compelling even the highest gods to do their bidding, and actuallythreatened them with destruction in case of disobedience. Sometimes, without going quite sofar as that, the wizard declared that he would scatter the bones of Osiris or reveal his sacredlegend, if the god proved contumacious. Similarly in India at the present day the great Hindootrinity itself of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva is subject to the sorcerers, who, by means of theirspells, exercise such an ascendency over the mightiest deities, that these are bound submis-sively to execute on earth below, or in heaven above, whatever commands their masters themagicians may please to issue. There is a saying everywhere current in India: “The wholeuniverse is subject to the gods; the gods are subject to the spells (mantras); the spells to theBrahmans; therefore the Brahmans are our gods.”Page 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"This radical conflict of principle between magic and religion sufficiently explains the relentlesshostility with which in history the priest has often pursued the magician. The haughty self-suf-ficiency of the magician, his arrogant demeanour towards the higher powers, and hisunabashed claim to exercise a sway like theirs could not but revolt the priest, to whom, withhis awful sense of the divine majesty, and his humble prostration in presence of it, suchclaims and such a demeanour must have appeared an impious and blasphemous usurpationof prerogatives that belong to God alone. And sometimes, we may suspect, lower motivesconcurred to whet the edge of the priest’s hostility. He professed to be the proper medium,the true intercessor between God and man, and no doubt his interests as well as his feelingswere often injured by a rival practitioner, who preached a surer and smoother road to fortunethan the rugged and slippery path of divine favour.Yet this antagonism, familiar as it is to us, seems to have made its appearance comparativelylate in the history of religion. At an earlier stage the functions of priest and sorcerer wereoften combined or, to speak perhaps more correctly, were not yet differentiated from eachother. To serve his purpose man wooed the good-will of gods or spirits by prayer and sacri-fice, while at the same time he had recourse to ceremonies and forms of words which hehoped would of themselves bring about the desired result without the help of god or devil. Inshort, he performed religious and magical rites simultaneously; he uttered prayers and incan-tations almost in the same breath, knowing or recking little of the theoretical inconsistency ofhis behaviour, so long as by hook or crook he contrived to get what he wanted. Instances ofthis fusion or confusion of magic with religion have already met us in the practices ofMelanesians and of other peoples.The same confusion of magic and religion has survived among peoples that have risen tohigher levels of culture. It was rife in ancient India and ancient Egypt; it is by no meansextinct among European peasantry at the present day. With regard to ancient India we aretold by an eminent Sanscrit scholar that “the sacrificial ritual at the earliest period of which wehave detailed information is pervaded with practices that breathe the spirit of the most primi-tive magic.” Speaking of the importance of magic in the East, and especially in Egypt,Professor Maspero remarks that “we ought not to attach to the word magic the degradingidea which it almost inevitably calls up in the mind of a modern. Ancient magic was the veryfoundation of religion. The faithful who desired to obtain some favour from a god had nochance of succeeding except by laying hands on the deity, and this arrest could only beeffected by means of a certain number of rites, sacrifices, prayers, and chants, which the godhimself had revealed, and which obliged him to do what was demanded of him.”Among the ignorant classes of modern Europe the same confusion of ideas, the same mix-ture of religion and magic, crops up in various forms. Thus we are told that in France “themajority of the peasants still believe that the priest possesses a secret and irresistible powerover the elements. By reciting certain prayers which he alone knows and has the right toutter, yet for the utterance of which he must afterwards demand absolution, he can, on anoccasion of pressing danger, arrest or reverse for a moment the action of the eternal laws ofthe physical world. The winds, the storms, the hail, and the rain are at his command and obeyhis will. The fire also is subject to him, and the flames of a conflagration are extinguished athis word.” For example, French peasants used to be, perhaps are still, persuaded that thepriests could celebrate, with certain special rites, a Mass of the Holy Spirit, of which the effi-cacy was so miraculous that it never met with any opposition from the divine will; God wasforced to grant whatever was asked of Him in this form, however rash and importunate mightbe the petition. No idea of impiety or irreverence attached to the rite in the minds of thosePage 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"who, in some of the great extremities of life, sought by this singular means to take the king-dom of heaven by storm. The secular priests generally refused to say the Mass of the HolySpirit; but the monks, especially the Capuchin friars, had the reputation of yielding with lessscruple to the entreaties of the anxious and distressed. In the constraint thus supposed byCatholic peasantry to be laid by the priest upon the deity we seem to have an exact counter-part of the power which the ancient Egyptians ascribed to their magicians. Again, to takeanother example, in many villages of Provence the priest is still reputed to possess the facultyof averting storms. It is not every priest who enjoys this reputation; and in some villages,when a change of pastors takes place, the parishioners are eager to learn whether the newincumbent has the power (pouder), as they call it. At the first sign of a heavy storm they puthim to the proof by inviting him to exorcise the threatening clouds; and if the result answers totheir hopes, the new shepherd is assured of the sympathy and respect of his flock. In someparishes, where the reputation of the curate in this respect stood higher than that of his rec-tor, the relations between the two have been so strained in consequence that the bishop hashad to translate the rector to another benefice. Again, Gascon peasants believe that torevenge themselves on their enemies bad men will sometimes induce a priest to say a masscalled the Mass of Saint Sécaire. Very few priests know this mass, and three-fourths of thosewho do know it would not say it for love or money. None but wicked priests dare to performthe gruesome ceremony, and you may be quite sure that they will have a very heavy accountto render for it at the last day. No curate or bishop, not even the archbishop of Auch, can par-don them; that right belongs to the pope of Rome alone. The Mass of Saint Sécaire may besaid only in a ruined or deserted church, where owls mope and hoot, where bats flit in thegloaming, where gypsies lodge of nights, and where toads squat under the desecrated altar.Thither the bad priest comes by night with his light o’ love, and at the first stroke of eleven hebegins to mumble the mass backwards, and ends just as the clocks are knelling the midnighthour. His leman acts as clerk. The host he blesses is black and has three points; he conse-crates no wine, but instead he drinks the water of a well into which the body of an unbaptizedinfant has been flung. He makes the sign of the cross, but it is on the ground and with his leftfoot. And many other things he does which no good Christian could look upon without beingstruck blind and deaf and dumb for the rest of his life. But the man for whom the mass is saidwithers away little by little, and nobody can say what is the matter with him; even the doctorscan make nothing of it. They do not know that he is slowly dying of the Mass of Saint Sécaire.Yet though magic is thus found to fuse and amalgamate with religion in many ages and inmany lands, there are some grounds for thinking that this fusion is not primitive, and thatthere was a time when man trusted to magic alone for the satisfaction of such wants as tran-scended his immediate animal cravings. In the first place a consideration of the fundamentalnotions of magic and religion may incline us to surmise that magic is older than religion in thehistory of humanity. We have seen that on the one hand magic is nothing but a mistakenapplication of the very simplest and most elementary processes of the mind, namely theassociation of ideas by virtue of resemblance or contiguity; and that on the other hand religionassumes the operation of conscious or personal agents, superior to man, behind the visiblescreen of nature. Obviously the conception of personal agents is more complex than a simplerecognition of the similarity or contiguity of ideas; and a theory which assumes that the courseof nature is determined by conscious agents is more abstruse and recondite, and requires forits apprehension a far higher degree of intelligence and reflection, than the view that thingssucceed each other simply by reason of their contiguity or resemblance. The very beastsassociate the ideas of things that are like each other or that have been found together in theirexperience; and they could hardly survive for a day if they ceased to do so. But who attrib-utes to the animals a belief that the phenomena of nature are worked by a multitude of invisi-Page 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"ble animals or by one enormous and prodigiously strong animal behind the scenes? It isprobably no injustice to the brutes to assume that the honour of devising a theory of this lattersort must be reserved for human reason. Thus, if magic be deduced immediately from ele-mentary processes of reasoning, and be, in fact, an error into which the mind falls almostspontaneously, while religion rests on conceptions which the merely animal intelligence canhardly be supposed to have yet attained to, it becomes probable that magic arose before reli-gion in the evolution of our race, and that man essayed to bend nature to his wishes by thesheer force of spells and enchantments before he strove to coax and mollify a coy, capri-cious, or irascible deity by the soft insinuation of prayer and sacrifice.The conclusion which we have thus reached deductively from a consideration of the funda-mental ideas of magic and religion is confirmed inductively by the observation that among theaborigines of Australia, the rudest savages as to whom we possess accurate information,magic is universally practised, whereas religion in the sense of a propitiation or conciliation ofthe higher powers seems to be nearly unknown. Roughly speaking, all men in Australia aremagicians, but not one is a priest; everybody fancies he can influence his fellows or thecourse of nature by sympathetic magic, but nobody dreams of propitiating gods by prayer andsacrifice.But if in the most backward state of human society now known to us we find magic thus con-spicuously present and religion conspicuously absent, may we not reasonably conjecture thatthe civilised races of the world have also at some period of their history passed through asimilar intellectual phase, that they attempted to force the great powers of nature to do theirpleasure before they thought of courting their favour by offerings and prayer—in short that,just as on the material side of human culture there has everywhere been an Age of Stone, soon the intellectual side there has everywhere been an Age of Magic? There are reasons foranswering this question in the affirmative. When we survey the existing races of mankindfrom Greenland to Tierra del Fuego, or from Scotland to Singapore, we observe that they aredistinguished one from the other by a great variety of religions, and that these distinctions arenot, so to speak, merely coterminous with the broad distinctions of race, but descend into theminuter subdivisions of states and commonwealths, nay, that they honeycomb the town, thevillage, and even the family, so that the surface of society all over the world is cracked andseamed, sapped and mined with rents and fissures and yawning crevasses opened up by thedisintegrating influence of religious dissension. Yet when we have penetrated through thesedifferences, which affect mainly the intelligent and thoughtful part of the community, we shallfind underlying them all a solid stratum of intellectual agreement among the dull, the weak,the ignorant, and the superstitious, who constitute, unfortunately, the vast majority ofmankind. One of the great achievements of the nineteenth century was to run shafts downinto this low mental stratum in many parts of the world, and thus to discover its substantialidentity everywhere. It is beneath our feet—and not very far beneath them—here in Europe atthe present day, and it crops up on the surface in the heart of the Australian wilderness andwherever the advent of a higher civilisation has not crushed it under ground. This universalfaith, this truly Catholic creed, is a belief in the efficacy of magic. While religious systems dif-fer not only in different countries, but in the same country in different ages, the system ofsympathetic magic remains everywhere and at all times substantially alike in its principles andpractice. Among the ignorant and superstitious classes of modern Europe it is very muchwhat it was thousands of years ago in Egypt and India, and what it now is among the lowestsavages surviving in the remotest corners of the world. If the test of truth lay in a show ofhands or a counting of heads, the system of magic might appeal, with far more reason thanthe Catholic Church, to the proud motto, “Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus,” asPage 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"the sure and certain credential of its own infallibility.It is not our business here to consider what bearing the permanent existence of such a solidlayer of savagery beneath the surface of society, and unaffected by the superficial changes ofreligion and culture, has upon the future of humanity. The dispassionate observer, whosestudies have led him to plumb its depths, can hardly regard it otherwise than as a standingmenace to civilisation. We seem to move on a thin crust which may at any moment be rent bythe subterranean forces slumbering below. From time to time a hollow murmur undergroundor a sudden spirt of flame into the air tells of what is going on beneath our feet. Now and thenthe polite world is startled by a paragraph in a newspaper which tells how in Scotland animage has been found stuck full of pins for the purpose of killing an obnoxious laird or minis-ter, how a woman has been slowly roasted to death as a witch in Ireland, or how a girl hasbeen murdered and chopped up in Russia to make those candles of human tallow by whoselight thieves hope to pursue their midnight trade unseen. But whether the influences thatmake for further progress, or those that threaten to undo what has already been accom-plished, will ultimately prevail; whether the impulsive energy of the minority or the deadweight of the majority of mankind will prove the stronger force to carry us up to higher heightsor to sink us into lower depths, are questions rather for the sage, the moralist, and the states-man, whose eagle vision scans the future, than for the humble student of the present and thepast. Here we are only concerned to ask how far the uniformity, the universality, and the per-manence of a belief in magic, compared with the endless variety and the shifting character ofreligious creeds, raises a presumption that the former represents a ruder and earlier phase ofthe human mind, through which all the races of mankind have passed or are passing on theirway to religion and science.If an Age of Religion has thus everywhere, as I venture to surmise, been preceded by an Ageof Magic, it is natural that we should enquire what causes have led mankind, or rather a por-tion of them, to abandon magic as a principle of faith and practice and to betake themselvesto religion instead. When we reflect upon the multitude, the variety, and the complexity of thefacts to be explained, and the scantiness of our information regarding them, we shall beready to acknowledge that a full and satisfactory solution of so profound a problem is hardlyto be hoped for, and that the most we can do in the present state of our knowledge is to haz-ard a more or less plausible conjecture. With all due diffidence, then, I would suggest that atardy recognition of the inherent falsehood and barrenness of magic set the more thoughtfulpart of mankind to cast about for a truer theory of nature and a more fruitful method of turningher resources to account. The shrewder intelligences must in time have come to perceive thatmagical ceremonies and incantations did not really effect the results which they weredesigned to produce, and which the majority of their simpler fellows still believed that they didactually produce. This great discovery of the inefficacy of magic must have wrought a radicalthough probably slow revolution in the minds of those who had the sagacity to make it. Thediscovery amounted to this, that men for the first time recognised their inability to manipulateat pleasure certain natural forces which hitherto they had believed to be completely withintheir control. It was a confession of human ignorance and weakness. Man saw that he hadtaken for causes what were no causes, and that all his efforts to work by means of theseimaginary causes had been vain. His painful toil had been wasted, his curious ingenuity hadbeen squandered to no purpose. He had been pulling at strings to which nothing wasattached; he had been marching, as he thought, straight to the goal, while in reality he hadonly been treading in a narrow circle. Not that the effects which he had striven so hard to pro-duce did not continue to manifest themselves. They were still produced, but not by him. Therain still fell on the thirsty ground: the sun still pursued his daily, and the moon her nightlyPage 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"journey across the sky: the silent procession of the seasons still moved in light and shadow,in cloud and sunshine across the earth: men were still born to labour and sorrow, and still,after a brief sojourn here, were gathered to their fathers in the long home hereafter. All thingsindeed went on as before, yet all seemed different to him from whose eyes the old scales hadfallen. For he could no longer cherish the pleasing illusion that it was he who guided the earthand the heaven in their courses, and that they would cease to perform their great revolutionswere he to take his feeble hand from the wheel. In the death of his enemies and his friendshe no longer saw a proof of the resistless potency of his own or of hostile enchantments; henow knew that friends and foes alike had succumbed to a force stronger than any that hecould wield, and in obedience to a destiny which he was powerless to control.Thus cut adrift from his ancient moorings and left to toss on a troubled sea of doubt anduncertainty, his old happy confidence in himself and his powers rudely shaken, our primitivephilosopher must have been sadly perplexed and agitated till he came to rest, as in a quiethaven after a tempestuous voyage, in a new system of faith and practice, which seemed tooffer a solution of his harassing doubts and a substitute, however precarious, for that sover-eignty over nature which he had reluctantly abdicated. If the great world went on its way with-out the help of him or his fellows, it must surely be because there were other beings, like him-self, but far stronger, who, unseen themselves, directed its course and brought about all thevaried series of events which he had hitherto believed to be dependent on his own magic. Itwas they, as he now believed, and not he himself, who made the stormy wind to blow, thelightning to flash, and the thunder to roll; who had laid the foundations of the solid earth andset bounds to the restless sea that it might not pass; who caused all the glorious lights ofheaven to shine; who gave the fowls of the air their meat and the wild beasts of the deserttheir prey; who bade the fruitful land to bring forth in abundance, the high hills to be clothedwith forests, the bubbling springs to rise under the rocks in the valleys, and green pastures togrow by still waters; who breathed into man’s nostrils and made him live, or turned him todestruction by famine and pestilence and war. To these mighty beings, whose handiwork hetraced in all the gorgeous and varied pageantry of nature, man now addressed himself,humbly confessing his dependence on their invisible power, and beseeching them of theirmercy to furnish him with all good things, to defend him from the perils and dangers by whichour mortal life is compassed about on every hand, and finally to bring his immortal spirit,freed from the burden of the body, to some happier world, beyond the reach of pain and sor-row, where he might rest with them and with the spirits of good men in joy and felicity forever.In this, or some such way as this, the deeper minds may be conceived to have made thegreat transition from magic to religion. But even in them the change can hardly ever havebeen sudden; probably it proceeded very slowly, and required long ages for its more or lessperfect accomplishment. For the recognition of man’s powerlessness to influence the courseof nature on a grand scale must have been gradual; he cannot have been shorn of the wholeof his fancied dominion at a blow. Step by step he must have been driven back from hisproud position; foot by foot he must have yielded, with a sigh, the ground which he had onceviewed as his own. Now it would be the wind, now the rain, now the sunshine, now the thun-der, that he confessed himself unable to wield at will; and as province after province of naturethus fell from his grasp, till what had once seemed a kingdom threatened to shrink into aprison, man must have been more and more profoundly impressed with a sense of his ownhelplessness and the might of the invisible beings by whom he believed himself to be sur-rounded. Thus religion, beginning as a slight and partial acknowledgment of powers superiorto man, tends with the growth of knowledge to deepen into a confession of man’s entire andPage 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"absolute dependence on the divine; his old free bearing is exchanged for an attitude of lowli-est prostration before the mysterious powers of the unseen, and his highest virtue is to submithis will to theirs: In la sua volontade è nostra pace. But this deepening sense of religion, thismore perfect submission to the divine will in all things, affects only those higher intelligenceswho have breadth of view enough to comprehend the vastness of the universe and the little-ness of man. Small minds cannot grasp great ideas; to their narrow comprehension, their pur-blind vision, nothing seems really great and important but themselves. Such minds hardly riseinto religion at all. They are, indeed, drilled by their betters into an outward conformity with itsprecepts and a verbal profession of its tenets; but at heart they cling to their old magicalsuperstitions, which may be discountenanced and forbidden, but cannot be eradicated by reli-gion, so long as they have their roots deep down in the mental framework and constitution ofthe great majority of mankind.The reader may well be tempted to ask, How was it that intelligent men did not sooner detectthe fallacy of magic? How could they continue to cherish expectations that were invariablydoomed to disappointment? With what heart persist in playing venerable antics that led tonothing, and mumbling solemn balderdash that remained without effect? Why cling to beliefswhich were so flatly contradicted by experience? How dare to repeat experiments that hadfailed so often? The answer seems to be that the fallacy was far from easy to detect, the fail-ure by no means obvious, since in many, perhaps in most cases, the desired event did actu-ally follow, at a longer or shorter interval, the performance of the rite which was designed tobring it about; and a mind of more than common acuteness was needed to perceive that,even in these cases, the rite was not necessarily the cause of the event. A ceremony intend-ed to make the wind blow or the rain fall, or to work the death of an enemy, will always be fol-lowed, sooner or later, by the occurrence it is meant to bring to pass; and primitive man maybe excused for regarding the occurrence as a direct result of the ceremony, and the best pos-sible proof of its efficacy. Similarly, rites observed in the morning to help the sun to rise, andin spring to wake the dreaming earth from her winter sleep, will invariably appear to becrowned with success, at least within the temperate zones; for in these regions the sun lightshis golden lamp in the east every morning, and year by year the vernal earth decks herselfafresh with a rich mantle of green. Hence the practical savage, with his conservative instincts,might well turn a deaf ear to the subtleties of the theoretical doubter, the philosophic radical,who presumed to hint that sunrise and spring might not, after all, be direct consequences ofthe punctual performance of certain daily or yearly ceremonies, and that the sun might per-haps continue to rise and trees to blossom though the ceremonies were occasionally intermit-ted, or even discontinued altogether. These sceptical doubts would naturally be repelled bythe other with scorn and indignation as airy reveries subversive of the faith and manifestlycontradicted by experience. “Can anything be plainer,” he might say, “than that I light my two-penny candle on earth and that the sun then kindles his great fire in heaven? I should be gladto know whether, when I have put on my green robe in spring, the trees do not afterwards dothe same? These are facts patent to everybody, and on them I take my stand. I am a plainpractical man, not one of your theorists and splitters of hairs and choppers of logic. Theoriesand speculation and all that may be very well in their way, and I have not the least objectionto your indulging in them, provided, of course, you do not put them in practice. But give meleave to stick to facts; then I know where I am.” The fallacy of this reasoning is obvious to us,because it happens to deal with facts about which we have long made up our minds. But letan argument of precisely the same calibre be applied to matters which are still under debate,and it may be questioned whether a British audience would not applaud it as sound, andesteem the speaker who used it a safe man—not brilliant or showy, perhaps, but thoroughlysensible and hard-headed. If such reasonings could pass muster among ourselves, need wePage 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"wonder that they long escaped detection by the savage?Chapter VThe Magical Control of the Weather1. THE PUBLIC MAGICIANTHE reader may remember that we were led to plunge into the labyrinth of magic by a con-sideration of two different types of man-god. This is the clue which has guided our devioussteps through the maze, and brought us out at last on higher ground, whence, resting a littleby the way, we can look back over the path we have already traversed and forward to thelonger and steeper road we have still to climb. As a result of the foregoing discussion, the two types of human gods may conveniently bedistinguished as the religious and the magical man-god respectively. In the former, a being ofan order different from and superior to man is supposed to become incarnate, for a longer ora shorter time, in a human body, manifesting his super-human power and knowledge by mira-cles wrought and prophecies uttered through the medium of the fleshly tabernacle in which hehas deigned to take up his abode. This may also appropriately be called the inspired or incar-nate type of man-god. In it the human body is merely a frail earthly vessel filled with a divineand immortal spirit. On the other hand, a man-god of the magical sort is nothing but a manwho possesses in an unusually high degree powers which most of his fellows arrogate tothemselves on a smaller scale; for in rude society there is hardly a person who does not dab-ble in magic. Thus, whereas a man-god of the former or inspired type derives his divinity froma deity who has stooped to hide his heavenly radiance behind a dull mask of earthly mould, aman-god of the latter type draws his extraordinary power from a certain physical sympathywith nature. He is not merely the receptacle of a divine spirit. His whole being, body and soul,is so delicately attuned to the harmony of the world that a touch of his hand or a turn of hishead may send a thrill vibrating through the universal framework of things; and conversely hisdivine organism is acutely sensitive to such slight changes of environment as would leaveordinary mortals wholly unaffected. But the line between these two types of man-god, howev-er sharply we may draw it in theory, is seldom to be traced with precision in practice, and inwhat follows I shall not insist on it.We have seen that in practice the magic art may be employed for the benefit either of individ-uals or of the whole community, and that according as it is directed to one or other of thesetwo objects it may be called private or public magic. Further, I pointed out that the publicmagician occupies a position of great influence, from which, if he is a prudent and able man,he may advance step by step to the rank of a chief or king. Thus an examination of publicmagic conduces to an understanding of the early kingship, since in savage and barbaroussociety many chiefs and kings appear to owe their authority in great measure to their reputa-tion as magicians.Among the objects of public utility which magic may be employed to secure, the most essen-tial is an adequate supply of food. The examples cited in preceding pages prove that the pur-veyors of food—the hunter, the fisher, the farmer—all resort to magical practices in the pursuitof their various callings; but they do so as private individuals for the benefit of themselves andtheir families, rather than as public functionaries acting in the interest of the whole people. Itis otherwise when the rites are performed, not by the hunters, the fishers, the farmers them-selves, but by professional magicians on their behalf. In primitive society, where uniformity ofPage 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"occupation is the rule, and the distribution of the community into various classes of workershas hardly begun, every man is more or less his own magician; he practises charms andincantations for his own good and the injury of his enemies. But a great step in advance hasbeen taken when a special class of magicians has been instituted; when, in other words, anumber of men have been set apart for the express purpose of benefiting the whole commu-nity by their skill, whether that skill be directed to the healing of diseases, the forecasting ofthe future, the regulation of the weather, or any other object of general utility. The impotenceof the means adopted by most of these practitioners to accomplish their ends ought not toblind us to the immense importance of the institution itself. Here is a body of men relieved, atleast in the higher stages of savagery, from the need of earning their livelihood by hard manu-al toil, and allowed, nay, expected and encouraged, to prosecute researches into the secretways of nature. It was at once their duty and their interest to know more than their fellows, toacquaint themselves with everything that could aid man in his arduous struggle with nature,everything that could mitigate his sufferings and prolong his life. The properties of drugs andminerals, the causes of rain and drought, of thunder and lightning, the changes of the sea-sons, the phases of the moon, the daily and yearly journeys of the sun, the motions of thestars, the mystery of life, and the mystery of death, all these things must have excited thewonder of these early philosophers, and stimulated them to find solutions of problems thatwere doubtless often thrust on their attention in the most practical form by the importunatedemands of their clients, who expected them not merely to understand but to regulate thegreat processes of nature for the good of man. That their first shots fell very far wide of themark could hardly be helped. The slow, the never-ending approach to truth consists in perpet-ually forming and testing hypotheses, accepting those which at the time seem to fit the factsand rejecting the others. The views of natural causation embraced by the savage magician nodoubt appear to us manifestly false and absurd; yet in their day they were legitimate hypothe-ses, though they have not stood the test of experience. Ridicule and blame are the just meed,not of those who devised these crude theories, but of those who obstinately adhered to themafter better had been propounded. Certainly no men ever had stronger incentives in the pur-suit of truth than these savage sorcerers. To maintain at least a show of knowledge wasabsolutely necessary; a single mistake detected might cost them their life. This no doubt ledthem to practise imposture for the purpose of concealing their ignorance; but it also suppliedthem with the most powerful motive for substituting a real for a sham knowledge, since, if youwould appear to know anything, by far the best way is actually to know it. Thus, however just-ly we may reject the extravagant pretensions of magicians and condemn the deceptionswhich they have practised on mankind, the original institution of this class of men has, take itall in all, been productive of incalculable good to humanity. They were the direct predeces-sors, not merely of our physicians and surgeons, but of our investigators and discoverers inevery branch of natural science. They began the work which has since been carried to suchglorious and beneficent issues by their successors in after ages; and if the beginning waspoor and feeble, this is to be imputed to the inevitable difficulties which beset the path ofknowledge rather than to the natural incapacity or wilful fraud of the men themselves.2. THE MAGICAL CONTROL OF RAINOf the things which the public magician sets himself to do for the good of the tribe, one of thechief is to control the weather and especially to ensure an adequate fall of rain. Water is anessential of life, and in most countries the supply of it depends upon showers. Without rainvegetation withers, animals and men languish and die. Hence in savage communities therain-maker is a very important personage; and often a special class of magicians exists forthe purpose of regulating the heavenly water-supply. The methods by which they attempt toPage 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"discharge the duties of their office are commonly, though not always, based on the principleof homoeopathic or imitative magic. If they wish to make rain they simulate it by sprinklingwater or mimicking clouds: if their object is to stop rain and cause drought, they avoid waterand resort to warmth and fire for the sake of drying up the too abundant moisture. Suchattempts are by no means confined, as the cultivated reader might imagine, to the nakedinhabitants of those sultry lands like Central Australia and some parts of Eastern andSouthern Africa, where often for months together the pitiless sun beats down out of a blueand cloudless sky on the parched and gaping earth. They are, or used to be, commonenough among outwardly civilised folk in the moister climate of Europe. I will now illustratethem by instances drawn from the practice both of public and private magic.Thus, for example, in a village near Dorpat, in Russia, when rain was much wanted, threemen used to climb up the fir-trees of an old sacred grove. One of them drummed with a ham-mer on a kettle or small cask to imitate thunder; the second knocked two fire-brands togetherand made the sparks fly, to imitate lightning; and the third, who was called “the rain-maker,”had a bunch of twigs with which he sprinkled water from a vessel on all sides. To put an endto drought and bring down rain, women and girls of the village of Ploska are wont to go nakedby night to the boundaries of the village and there pour water on the ground. In Halmahera, orGilolo, a large island to the west of New Guinea, a wizard makes rain by dipping a branch ofa particular kind of tree in water and then scattering the moisture from the dripping boughover the ground. In New Britain the rain-maker wraps some leaves of a red and green stripedcreeper in a banana-leaf, moistens the bundle with water, and buries it in the ground; then heimitates with his mouth the plashing of rain. Amongst the Omaha Indians of North America,when the corn is withering for want of rain, the members of the sacred Buffalo Society fill alarge vessel with water and dance four times round it. One of them drinks some of the waterand spirts it into the air, making a fine spray in imitation of a mist or drizzling rain. Then heupsets the vessel, spilling the water on the ground; whereupon the dancers fall down anddrink up the water, getting mud all over their faces. Lastly, they squirt the water into the air,making a fine mist. This saves the corn. In spring-time the Natchez of North America used toclub together to purchase favourable weather for their crops from the wizards. If rain wasneeded, the wizards fasted and danced with pipes full of water in their mouths. The pipeswere perforated like the nozzle of a watering-can, and through the holes the rain-maker blewthe water towards that part of the sky where the clouds hung heaviest. But if fine weather waswanted, he mounted the roof of his hut, and with extended arms, blowing with all his might,he beckoned to the clouds to pass by. When the rains do not come in due season the peopleof Central Angoniland repair to what is called the rain-temple. Here they clear away the grass,and the leader pours beer into a pot which is buried in the ground, while he says, “MasterChauta, you have hardened your heart towards us, what would you have us do? We mustperish indeed. Give your children the rains, there is the beer we have given you.” Then theyall partake of the beer that is left over, even the children being made to sip it. Next they takebranches of trees and dance and sing for rain. When they return to the village they find a ves-sel of water set at the doorway by an old woman; so they dip their branches in it and wavethem aloft, so as to scatter the drops. After that the rain is sure to come driving up in heavyclouds. In these practices we see a combination of religion with magic; for while the scatteringof the water-drops by means of branches is a purely magical ceremony, the prayer for rainand the offering of beer are purely religious rites. In the Mara tribe of Northern Australia therain-maker goes to a pool and sings over it his magic song. Then he takes some of the waterin his hands, drinks it, and spits it out in various directions. After that he throws water all overhimself, scatters it about, and returns quietly to the camp. Rain is supposed to follow. TheArab historian Makrizi describes a method of stopping rain which is said to have been resort-Page 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"ed to by a tribe of nomads called Alqamar in Hadramaut. They cut a branch from a certaintree in the desert, set it on fire, and then sprinkled the burning brand with water. After that thevehemence of the rain abated, just as the water vanished when it fell on the glowing brand.Some of the Eastern Angamis of Manipur are said to perform a some-what similar ceremonyfor the opposite purpose, in order, namely, to produce rain. The head of the village puts aburning brand on the grave of a man who has died of burns, and quenches the brand withwater, while he prays that rain may fall. Here the putting out the fire with water, which is animitation of rain, is reinforced by the influence of the dead man, who, having been burnt todeath, will naturally be anxious for the descent of rain to cool his scorched body and assuagehis pangs.Other people besides the Arabs have used fire as a means of stopping rain. Thus the Sulkaof New Britain heat stones red hot in the fire and then put them out in the rain, or they throwhot ashes in the air. They think that the rain will soon cease to fall, for it does not like to beburned by the hot stones or ashes. The Telugus send a little girl out naked into the rain with aburning piece of wood in her hand, which she has to show to the rain. That is supposed tostop the downpour. At Port Stevens in New South Wales the medicine-men used to driveaway rain by throwing fire-sticks into the air, while at the same time they puffed and shouted.Any man of the Anula tribe in Northern Australia can stop rain by simply warming a greenstick in the fire, and then striking it against the wind. In time of severe drought the Dieri of Central Australia, loudly lamenting the impoverishedstate of the country and their own half-starved condition, call upon the spirits of their remotepredecessors, whom they call Mura-muras, to grant them power to make a heavy rain-fall.For they believe that the clouds are bodies in which rain is generated by their own cere-monies or those of neighbouring tribes, through the influence of the Mura-muras. The way inwhich they set about drawing rain from the clouds is this. A hole is dug about twelve feet longand eight or ten broad, and over this hole a conical hut of logs and branches is made. Twowizards, supposed to have received a special inspiration from the Mura-muras, are bled byan old and influential man with a sharp flint; and the blood, drawn from their arms below theelbow, is made to flow on the other men of the tribe, who sit huddled together in the hut. Atthe same time the two bleeding men throw handfuls of down about, some of which adheres tothe blood-stained bodies of their comrades, while the rest floats in the air. The blood isthought to represent the rain, and the down the clouds. During the ceremony two large stonesare placed in the middle of the hut; they stand for gathering clouds and presage rain. Thenthe wizards who were bled carry away the two stones for about ten or fifteen miles, and placethem as high as they can in the tallest tree. Meanwhile the other men gather gypsum, poundit fine, and throw it into a water-hole. This the Mura-muras see, and at once they causeclouds to appear in the sky. Lastly, the men, young and old, surround the hut, and, stoopingdown, butt at it with their heads, like so many rams. Thus they force their way through it andreappear on the other side, repeating the process till the hut is wrecked. In doing this they areforbidden to use their hands or arms; but when the heavy logs alone remain, they are allowedto pull them out with their hands. “The piercing of the hut with their heads symbolises thepiercing of the clouds; the fall of the hut, the fall of the rain.” Obviously, too, the act of placinghigh up in trees the two stones, which stand for clouds, is a way of making the real clouds tomount up in the sky. The Dieri also imagine that the foreskins taken from lads at circumcisionhave a great power of producing rain. Hence the Great Council of the tribe always keeps asmall stock of foreskins ready for use. They are carefully concealed, being wrapt up in feath-ers with the fat of the wild dog and of the carpet snake. A woman may not see such a parcelopened on any account. When the ceremony is over, the foreskin is buried, its virtue beingPage 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"exhausted. After the rains have fallen, some of the tribe always undergo a surgical operation,which consists in cutting the skin of their chest and arms with a sharp flint. The wound is thentapped with a flat stick to increase the flow of blood, and red ochre is rubbed into it. Raisedscars are thus produced. The reason alleged by the natives for this practice is that they arepleased with the rain, and that there is a connexion between the rain and the scars.Apparently the operation is not very painful, for the patient laughs and jokes while it is goingon. Indeed, little children have been seen to crowd round the operator and patiently take theirturn; then after being operated on, they ran away, expanding their little chests and singing forthe rain to beat upon them. However, they were not so well pleased next day, when they felttheir wounds stiff and sore. In Java, when rain is wanted, two men will sometimes thrasheach other with supple rods till the blood flows down their backs; the streaming blood repre-sents the rain, and no doubt is supposed to make it fall on the ground. The people ofEgghiou, a district of Abyssinia, used to engage in sanguinary conflicts with each other, vil-lage against village, for a week together every January for the purpose of procuring rain.Some years ago the emperor Menelik forbade the custom. However, the following year therain was deficient, and the popular outcry so great that the emperor yielded to it, and allowedthe murderous fights to be resumed, but for two days a year only. The writer who mentionsthe custom regards the blood shed on these occasions as a propitiatory sacrifice offered tospirits who control the showers; but perhaps, as in the Australian and Javanese ceremonies,it is an imitation of rain. The prophets of Baal, who sought to procure rain by cutting them-selves with knives till the blood gushed out, may have acted on the same principle.There is a widespread belief that twin children possess magical powers over nature, especial-ly over rain and the weather. This curious superstition prevails among some of the Indiantribes of British Columbia, and has led them often to impose certain singular restrictions ortaboos on the parents of twins, though the exact meaning of these restrictions is generallyobscure. Thus the Tsimshian Indians of British Columbia believe that twins control the weath-er; therefore they pray to wind and rain, “Calm down, breath of the twins.” Further, they thinkthat the wishes of twins are always fulfilled; hence twins are feared, because they can harmthe man they hate. They can also call the salmon and the olachen or candle-fish, and so theyare known by a name which means “making plentiful.” In the opinion of the Kwakiutl Indiansof British Columbia twins are transformed salmon; hence they may not go near water, lestthey should be changed back again into the fish. In their childhood they can summon anywind by motions of their hands, and they can make fair or foul weather, and also cure dis-eases by swinging a large wooden rattle. The Nootka Indians of British Columbia also believethat twins are somehow related to salmon. Hence among them twins may not catch salmon,and they may not eat or even handle the fresh fish. They can make fair or foul weather, andcan cause rain to fall by painting their faces black and then washing them, which may repre-sent the rain dripping from the dark clouds. The Shuswap Indians, like the Thompson Indians,associate twins with the grizzly bear, for they call them “young grizzly bears.” According tothem, twins remain throughout life endowed with supernatural powers. In particular they canmake good or bad weather. They produce rain by spilling water from a basket in the air; theymake fine weather by shaking a small flat piece of wood attached to a stick by a string; theyraise storms by strewing down on the ends of spruce branches.The same power of influencing the weather is attributed to twins by the Baronga, a tribe ofBantu negroes who, inhabit the shores of Delagoa Bay in South-eastern Africa. They bestowthe name of Tilo—that is, the sky—on a woman who has given birth to twins, and the infantsthemselves are called the children of the sky. Now when the storms which generally burst inthe months of September and October have been looked for in vain, when a drought with itsPage 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"prospect of famine is threatening, and all nature, scorched and burnt up by a sun that hasshone for six months from a cloudless sky, is panting for the beneficent showers of the SouthAfrican spring, the women perform ceremonies to bring down the longed-for rain on theparched earth. Stripping themselves of all their garments, they assume in their stead girdlesand head-dresses of grass, or short petticoats made of the leaves of a particular sort ofcreeper. Thus attired, uttering peculiar cries and singing ribald songs, they go about from wellto well, cleansing them of the mud and impurities which have accumulated in them. Thewells, it may be said, are merely holes in the sand where a little turbid unwholesome waterstagnates. Further, the women must repair to the house of one of their gossips who has givenbirth to twins, and must drench her with water, which they carry in little pitchers. Having doneso they go on their way, shrieking out their loose songs and dancing immodest dances. Noman may see these leaf-clad women going their rounds. If they meet a man, they maul himand thrust him aside. When they have cleansed the wells, they must go and pour water onthe graves of their ancestors in the sacred grove. It often happens, too, that at the bidding ofthe wizard they go and pour water on the graves of twins. For they think that the grave of atwin ought always to be moist, for which reason twins are regularly buried near a lake. If alltheir efforts to procure rain prove abortive, they will remember that such and such a twin wasburied in a dry place on the side of a hill. “No wonder,” says the wizard in such a case, “thatthe sky is fiery. Take up his body and dig him a grave on the shore of the lake.” His orders areat once obeyed, for this is supposed to be the only means of bringing down the rain.Some of the foregoing facts strongly support an interpretation which Professor Oldenberg hasgiven of the rules to be observed by a Brahman who would learn a particular hymn of theancient Indian collection known as the Samaveda. The hymn, which bears the name of theSakvari song, was believed to embody the might of Indra’s weapon, the thunderbolt; andhence, on account of the dreadful and dangerous potency with which it was thus charged, thebold student who essayed to master it had to be isolated from his fellow-men, and to retirefrom the village into the forest. Here for a space of time, which might vary, according to differ-ent doctors of the law, from one to twelve years, he had to observe certain rules of life,among which were the following. Thrice a day he had to touch water; he must wear black gar-ments and eat black food; when it rained, he might not seek the shelter of a roof, but had tosit in the rain and say, “Water is the Sakvari song”; when the lightning flashed, he said, “Thatis like the Sakvari song”; when the thunder pealed, he said, “The Great One is making a greatnoise.” He might never cross a running stream without touching water; he might never setfoot on a ship unless his life were in danger, and even then he must be sure to touch waterwhen he went on board; “for in water,” so ran the saying, “lies the virtue of the Sakvari song.”When at last he was allowed to learn the song itself, he had to dip his hands in a vessel ofwater in which plants of all sorts had been placed. If a man walked in the way of all theseprecepts, the rain-god Parjanya, it was said, would send rain at the wish of that man. It isclear, as Professor Oldenberg well points out, that “all these rules are intended to bring theBrahman into union with water, to make him, as it were, an ally of the water powers, and toguard him against their hostility. The black garments and the black food have the same signif-icance; no one will doubt that they refer to the rain-clouds when he remembers that a blackvictim is sacrificed to procure rain; ‘it is black, for such is the nature of rain.’ In respect ofanother rain-charm it is said plainly, ‘He puts on a black garment edged with black, for such isthe nature of rain.’ We may therefore assume that here in the circle of ideas and ordinancesof the Vedic schools there have been preserved magical practices of the most remote antiqui-ty, which were intended to prepare the rain-maker for his office and dedicate him to it.” It is interesting to observe that where an opposite result is desired, primitive logic enjoins thePage 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"weather-doctor to observe precisely opposite rules of conduct. In the tropical island of Java,where the rich vegetation attests the abundance of the rainfall, ceremonies for the making ofrain are rare, but ceremonies for the prevention of it are not uncommon. When a man isabout to give a great feast in the rainy season and has invited many people, he goes to aweather-doctor and asks him to “prop up the clouds that may be lowering.” If the doctor con-sents to exert his professional powers, he begins to regulate his behaviour by certain rules assoon as his customer has departed. He must observe a fast, and may neither drink nor bathe;what little he eats must be eaten dry, and in no case may he touch water. The host, on hisside, and his servants, both male and female, must neither wash clothes nor bathe so long asthe feast lasts, and they have all during its continuance to observe strict chastity. The doctorseats himself on a new mat in his bedroom, and before a small oil-lamp he murmurs, shortlybefore the feast takes place, the following prayer or incantation: “Grandfather andGrandmother Sroekoel” (the name seems to be taken at random; others are sometimesused), “return to your country. Akkemat is your country. Put down your water-cask, close itproperly, that not a drop may fall out.” While he utters this prayer the sorcerer looks upwards,burning incense the while. So among the Toradjas the rain-doctor, whose special business itis to drive away rain, takes care not to touch water before, during, or after the discharge ofhis professional duties. He does not bathe, he eats with unwashed hands, he drinks nothingbut palm wine, and if he has to cross a stream he is careful not to step in the water. Havingthus prepared himself for his task he has a small hut built for himself outside of the village ina rice-field, and in this hut he keeps up a little fire, which on no account may be suffered to goout. In the fire he burns various kinds of wood, which are supposed to possess the propertyof driving off rain; and he puffs in the direction from which the rain threatens to come, holdingin his hand a packet of leaves and bark which derive a similar cloud-compelling virtue, notfrom their chemical composition, but from their names, which happen to signify something dryor volatile. If clouds should appear in the sky while he is at work, he takes lime in the hollowof his hand and blows it towards them. The lime, being so very dry, is obviously well adaptedto disperse the damp clouds. Should rain afterwards be wanted, he has only to pour water onhis fire, and immediately the rain will descend in sheets.The reader will observe how exactly the Javanese and Toradja observances, which areintended to prevent rain, form the antithesis of the Indian observances, which aim at produc-ing it. The Indian sage is commanded to touch water thrice a day regularly as well as on vari-ous special occasions; the Javanese and Toradja wizards may not touch it at all. The Indianlives out in the forest, and even when it rains he may not take shelter; the Javanese and theToradja sit in a house or a hut. The one signifies his sympathy with water by receiving the rainon his person and speaking of it respectfully; the others light a lamp or a fire and do their bestto drive the rain away. Yet the principle on which all three act is the same; each of them, by asort of childish make-believe, identifies himself with the phenomenon which he desires to pro-duce. It is the old fallacy that the effect resembles its cause: if you would make wet weather,you must be wet; if you would make dry weather, you must be dry.In South-eastern Europe at the present day ceremonies are observed for the purpose of mak-ing rain which not only rest on the same general train of thought as the preceding, but even intheir details resemble the ceremonies practised with the same intention by the Baronga ofDelagoa Bay. Among the Greeks of Thessaly and Macedonia, when a drought has lasted along time, it is customary to send a procession of children round to all the wells and springsof the neighbourhood. At the head of the procession walks a girl adorned with flowers, whomher companions drench with water at every halting-place, while they sing an invocation, ofwhich the following is part: Page 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"“Perperia all fresh bedewed, Freshen all the neighbourhood; By the woods, on the highway, As thou goest, to God now pray: O my God, upon the plain, Send thou us a still, small rain; That the fields may fruitful be, And vines in blossom we may see; That the grain be full and sound, And wealthy grow the folks around.”In time of drought the Serbians strip a girl to her skin and clothe her from head to foot ingrass, herbs, and flowers, even her face being hidden behind a veil of living green. Thus dis-guised she is called the Dodola, and goes through the village with a troop of girls. They stopbefore every house; the Dodola keeps turning herself round and dancing, while the other girlsform a ring about her singing one of the Dodola songs, and the housewife pours a pail ofwater over her. One of the songs they sing runs thus: “We go through the village; The clouds go in the sky; We go faster, Faster go the clouds; They have overtaken us, And wetted the corn and the vine.”At Poona in India, when rain is needed, the boys dress up one of their number in nothing butleaves and call him King of Rain. Then they go round to every house in the village, where thehouse-holder or his wife sprinkles the Rain King with water, and gives the party food of vari-ous kinds. When they have thus visited all the houses, they strip the Rain King of his leafyrobes and feast upon what they have gathered.Bathing is practised as a rain-charm in some parts of Southern and Western Russia.Sometimes after service in church the priest in his robes has been thrown down on theground and drenched with water by his parishioners. Sometimes it is the women who, withoutstripping off their clothes, bathe in crowds on the day of St. John the Baptist, while they dip inthe water a figure made of branches, grass, and herbs, which is supposed to represent thesaint. In Kursk, a province of Southern Russia, when rain is much wanted, the women seize apassing stranger and throw him into the river, or souse him from head to foot. Later on weshall see that a passing stranger is often taken for a deity or the personification of some natu-ral power. It is recorded in official documents that during a drought in 1790 the peasants ofScheroutz and Werboutz collected all the women and compelled them to bathe, in order thatrain might fall. An Armenian rain-charm is to throw the wife of a priest into the water anddrench her. The Arabs of North Africa fling a holy man, willy-nilly, into a spring as a remedyfor drought. In Minahassa, a province of North Celebes, the priest bathes as a rain-charm. InCentral Celebes when there has been no rain for a long time and the rice-stalks begin toshrivel up, many of the villagers, especially the young folk, go to a neighbouring brook andsplash each other with water, shouting noisily, or squirt water on one another through bambootubes. Sometimes they imitate the plump of rain by smacking the surface of the water withtheir hands, or by placing an inverted gourd on it and drumming on the gourd with their fin-Page 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"gers.Women are sometimes supposed to be able to make rain by ploughing, or pretending toplough. Thus the Pshaws and Chewsurs of the Caucasus have a ceremony called “ploughingthe rain,” which they observe in time of drought. Girls yoke themselves to a plough and drag itinto a river, wading in the water up to their girdles. In the same circumstances Armenian girlsand women do the same. The oldest woman, or the priest’s wife, wears the priest’s dress,while the others, dressed as men, drag the plough through the water against the stream. Inthe Caucasian province of Georgia, when a drought has lasted long, marriageable girls areyoked in couples with an ox-yoke on their shoulders, a priest holds the reins, and thus har-nessed they wade through rivers, puddles, and marshes, praying, screaming, weeping, andlaughing. In a district of Transylvania when the ground is parched with drought, some girlsstrip themselves naked, and, led by an older woman, who is also naked, they steal a harrowand carry it across the fields to a brook, where they set it afloat. Next they sit on the harrowand keep a tiny flame burning on each corner of it for an hour. Then they leave the harrow inthe water and go home. A similar rain-charm is resorted to in some parts of India; nakedwomen drag a plough across a field by night, while the men keep carefully out of the way, fortheir presence would break the spell.Sometimes the rain-charm operates through the dead. Thus in New Caledonia the rain-mak-ers blackened themselves all over, dug up a dead body, took the bones to a cave, jointedthem, and hung the skeleton over some taro leaves. Water was poured over the skeleton torun down on the leaves. They believed that the soul of the deceased took up the water, con-verted it into rain, and showered it down again. In Russia, if common report may be believed,it is not long since the peasants of any district that chanced to be afflicted with drought usedto dig up the corpse of some one who had drunk himself to death and sink it in the nearestswamp or lake, fully persuaded that this would ensure the fall of the needed rain. In 1868 theprospect of a bad harvest, caused by a prolonged drought, induced the inhabitants of a vil-lage in the Tarashchansk district to dig up the body of a Raskolnik, or Dissenter, who haddied in the preceding December. Some of the party beat the corpse, or what was left of it,about the head, exclaiming, “Give us rain!” while others poured water on it through a sieve.Here the pouring of water through a sieve seems plainly an imitation of a shower, andreminds us of the manner in which Strepsiades in Aristophanes imagined that rain was madeby Zeus. Sometimes, in order to procure rain, the Toradjas make an appeal to the pity of thedead. Thus, in the village of Kalingooa, there is the grave of a famous chief, the grandfatherof the present ruler. When the land suffers from unseasonable drought, the people go to thisgrave, pour water on it, and say, “O grandfather, have pity on us; if it is your will that this yearwe should eat, then give rain.” After that they hang a bamboo full of water over the grave;there is a small hole in the lower end of the bamboo, so that the water drips from it continual-ly. The bamboo is always refilled with water until rain drenches the ground. Here, as in NewCaledonia, we find religion blent with magic, for the prayer to the dead chief, which is purelyreligious, is eked out with a magical imitation of rain at his grave. We have seen that theBaronga of Delagoa Bay drench the tombs of their ancestors, especially the tombs of twins,as a raincharm. Among some of the Indian tribes in the region of the Orinoco it was custom-ary for the relations of a deceased person to disinter his bones a year after burial, burn them,and scatter the ashes to the winds, because they believed that the ashes were changed intorain, which the dead man sent in return for his obsequies. The Chinese are convinced thatwhen human bodies remain unburied, the souls of their late owners feel the discomfort ofrain, just as living men would do if they were exposed without shelter to the inclemency of theweather. These wretched souls, therefore, do all in their power to prevent the rain from falling,Page 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"and often their efforts are only too successful. Then drought ensues, the most dreaded of allcalamities in China, because bad harvests, dearth, and famine follow in its train. Hence it hasbeen a common practice of the Chinese authorities in time of drought to inter the dry bones ofthe unburied dead for the purpose of putting an end to the scourge and conjuring down therain.Animals, again, often play an important part in these weather-charms. The Anula tribe ofNorthern Australia associate the dollar-bird with rain, and call it the rain-bird. A man who hasthe bird for his totem can make rain at a certain pool. He catches a snake, puts it alive intothe pool, and after holding it under water for a time takes it out, kills it, and lays it down by theside of the creek. Then he makes an arched bundle of grass stalks in imitation of a rainbow,and sets it up over the snake. After that all he does is to sing over the snake and the mimicrainbow; sooner or later the rain will fall. They explain this procedure by saying that long agothe dollar-bird had as a mate at this spot a snake, who lived in the pool and used to makerain by spitting up into the sky till a rainbow and clouds appeared and rain fell. A commonway of making rain in many parts of Java is to bathe a cat or two cats, a male and a female;sometimes the animals are carried in procession with music. Even in Batavia you may fromtime to time see children going about with a cat for this purpose; when they have ducked it ina pool, they let it go.Among the Wambugwe of East Africa, when the sorcerer desires to make rain, he takes ablack sheep and a black calf in bright sunshine, and has them placed on the roof of the com-mon hut in which the people live together. Then he slits the stomachs of the animals andscatters their contents in all directions. After that he pours water and medicine into a vessel; ifthe charm has succeeded, the water boils up and rain follows. On the other hand, if the sor-cerer wishes to prevent rain from falling, he withdraws into the interior of the hut, and thereheats a rock-crystal in a calabash. In order to procure rain the Wagogo sacrifice black fowls,black sheep, and black cattle at the graves of dead ancestors, and the rain-maker wearsblack clothes during the rainy season. Among the Matabele the rain-charm employed by sor-cerers was made from the blood and gall of a black ox. In a district of Sumatra, in order toprocure rain, all the women of the village, scantily clad, go to the river, wade into it, andsplash each other with the water. A black cat is thrown into the stream and made to swimabout for a while, then allowed to escape to the bank, pursued by the splashing of thewomen. The Garos of Assam offer a black goat on the top of a very high mountain in time ofdrought. In all these cases the colour of the animal is part of the charm; being black, it willdarken the sky with rain-clouds. So the Bechuanas burn the stomach of an ox at evening,because they say, “The black smoke will gather the clouds and cause the rain to come.” TheTimorese sacrifice a black pig to the Earth-goddess for rain, a white or red one to the Sun-god for sunshine. The Angoni sacrifice a black ox for rain and a white one for fine weather.Among the high mountains of Japan there is a district in which, if rain has not fallen for a longtime, a party of villagers goes in procession to the bed of a mountain torrent, headed by apriest, who leads a black dog. At the chosen spot they tether the beast to a stone, and makeit a target for their bullets and arrows. When its life-blood bespatters the rocks, the peasantsthrow down their weapons and lift up their voices in supplication to the dragon divinity of thestream, exhorting him to send down forthwith a shower to cleanse the spot from its defile-ment. Custom has prescribed that on these occasions the colour of the victim shall be black,as an emblem of the wished-for rain-clouds. But if fine weather is wanted, the victim must bewhite, without a spot.The intimate association of frogs and toads with water has earned for these creatures a wide-Page 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"spread reputation as custodians of rain; and hence they often play a part in charms designedto draw needed showers from the sky. Some of the Indians of the Orinoco held the toad to bethe god or lord of the waters, and for that reason feared to kill the creature. They have beenknown to keep frogs under a pot and to beat them with rods when there was a drought. It issaid that the Aymara Indians often make little images of frogs and other aquatic animals andplace them on the tops of the hills as a means of bringing down rain. The Thompson Indiansof British Columbia and some people in Europe think that to kill a frog will cause rain to fall. Inorder to procure rain people of low caste in the Central Provinces of India will tie a frog to arod covered with green leaves and branches of the nîm tree (Azadirachta Indica) and carry itfrom door to door singing: “Send soon, O frog, the jewel of water! And ripen the wheat and millet in the field.” The Kapus or Reddis are a large caste of cultivators and landowners in the MadrasPresidency. When rain fails, women of the caste will catch a frog and tie it alive to a new win-nowing fan made of bamboo. On this fan they spread a few margosa leaves and go fromdoor to door singing, “Lady frog must have her bath. Oh! rain-god, give a little water for her atleast.” While the Kapu women sing this song, the woman of the house pours water over thefrog and gives an alms, convinced that by so doing she will soon bring rain down in torrents.Sometimes, when a drought has lasted a long time, people drop the usual hocus-pocus ofimitative magic altogether, and being far too angry to waste their breath in prayer they seekby threats and curses or even downright physical force to extort the waters of heaven fromthe supernatural being who has, so to say, cut them off at the main. In a Japanese village,when the guardian divinity had long been deaf to the peasants’ prayers for rain, they at lastthrew down his image and, with curses loud and long, hurled it head foremost into a stinkingrice-field. “There,” they said, “you may stay yourself for a while, to see how you will feel aftera few days’ scorching in this broiling sun that is burning the life from our cracking fields.” Inthe like circumstances the Feloupes of Senegambia cast down their fetishes and drag themabout the fields, cursing them till rain falls.The Chinese are adepts in the art of taking the kingdom of heaven by storm. Thus, when rainis wanted they make a huge dragon of paper or wood to represent the rain-god, and carry itabout in procession; but if no rain follows, the mock-dragon is execrated and torn to pieces.At other times they threaten and beat the god if he does not give rain; sometimes they pub-licly depose him from the rank of deity. On the other hand, if the wished-for rain falls, the godis promoted to a higher rank by an imperial decree. In April 1888 the mandarins of Cantonprayed to the god Lung-wong to stop the incessant downpour of rain; and when he turned adeaf ear to their petitions they put him in a lock-up for five days. This had a salutary effect.The rain ceased and the god was restored to liberty. Some years before, in time of drought,the same deity had been chained and exposed to the sun for days in the courtyard of histemple in order that he might feel for himself the urgent need of rain. So when the Siameseneed rain, they set out their idols in the blazing sun; but if they want dry weather, they unroofthe temples and let the rain pour down on the idols. They think that the inconvenience towhich the gods are thus subjected will induce them to grant the wishes of their worshippers.The reader may smile at the meteorology of the Far East; but precisely similar modes ofprocuring rain have been resorted to in Christian Europe within our own lifetime. By the endof April 1893 there was great distress in Sicily for lack of water. The drought had lasted sixPage 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"months. Every day the sun rose and set in a sky of cloudless blue. The gardens of the Concad’Oro, which surround Palermo with a magnificent belt of verdure, were withering. Food wasbecoming scarce. The people were in great alarm. All the most approved methods of procur-ing rain had been tried without effect. Processions had traversed the streets and the fields.Men, women, and children, telling their beads, had lain whole nights before the holy images.Consecrated candles had burned day and night in the churches. Palm branches, blessed onPalm Sunday, had been hung on the trees. At Solaparuta, in accordance with a very old cus-tom, the dust swept from the churches on Palm Sunday had been spread on the fields. Inordinary years these holy sweepings preserve the crops; but that year, if you will believe me,they had no effect whatever. At Nicosia the inhabitants, bare-headed and bare-foot, carriedthe crucifixes through all the wards of the town and scourged each other with iron whips. Itwas all in vain. Even the great St. Francis of Paolo himself, who annually performs the mira-cle of rain and is carried every spring through the market-gardens, either could not or wouldnot help. Masses, vespers, concerts, illuminations, fire-works—nothing could move him. Atlast the peasants began to lose patience. Most of the saints were banished. At Palermo theydumped St. Joseph in a garden to see the state of things for himself, and they swore to leavehim there in the sun till rain fell. Other saints were turned, like naughty children, with theirfaces to the wall. Others again, stripped of their beautiful robes, were exiled far from theirparishes, threatened, grossly insulted, ducked in horse-ponds. At Caltanisetta the goldenwings of St. Michael the Archangel were torn from his shoulders and replaced with wings ofpasteboard; his purple mantle was taken away and a clout wrapt about him instead. At Licatathe patron saint, St. Angelo, fared even worse, for he was left without any garments at all; hewas reviled, he was put in irons, he was threatened with drowning or hanging. “Rain or therope!” roared the angry people at him, as they shook their fists in his face.Sometimes an appeal is made to the pity of the gods. When their corn is being burnt up bythe sun, the Zulus look out for a “heaven bird,” kill it, and throw it into a pool. Then the heav-en melts with tenderness for the death of the bird; “it wails for it by raining, wailing a funeralwail.” In Zululand women sometimes bury their children up to the neck in the ground, andthen retiring to a distance keep up a dismal howl for a long time. The sky is supposed to meltwith pity at the sight. Then the women dig the children out and feel sure that rain will soon fol-low. They say that they call to “the lord above” and ask him to send rain. If it comes theydeclare that “Usondo rains.” In times of drought the Guanches of Teneriffe led their sheep tosacred ground, and there they separated the lambs from their dams, that their plaintive bleat-ing might touch the heart of the god. In Kumaon a way of stopping rain is to pour hot oil in theleft ear of a dog. The animal howls with pain, his howls are heard by Indra, and out of pity forthe beast’s sufferings the god stops the rain. Sometimes the Toradjas attempt to procure rainas follows. They place the stalks of certain plants in water, saying, “Go and ask for rain, andso long as no rain falls I will not plant you again, but there shall you die.” Also they stringsome fresh-water snails on a cord, and hang the cord on a tree, and say to the snails, “Goand ask for rain, and so long as no rain comes, I will not take you back to the water.” Thenthe snails go and weep, and the gods take pity and send rain. However, the foregoing cere-monies are religious rather than magical, since they involve an appeal to the compassion ofhigher powers.Stones are often supposed to possess the property of bringing on rain, provided they bedipped in water or sprinkled with it, or treated in some other appropriate manner. In aSamoan village a certain stone was carefully housed as the representative of the rain-makinggod, and in time of drought his priests carried the stone in procession and dipped it in astream. Among the Ta-ta-thi tribe of New South Wales, the rain-maker breaks off a piece ofPage 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"quartz-crystal and spits it towards the sky; the rest of the crystal he wraps in emu feathers,soaks both crystal and feathers in water, and carefully hides them. In the Keramin tribe ofNew South Wales the wizard retires to the bed of a creek, drops water on a round flat stone,then covers up and conceals it. Among some tribes of North-western Australia the rain-makerrepairs to a piece of ground which is set apart for the purpose of rain-making. There he buildsa heap of stones or sand, places on the top of it his magic stone, and walks or dances roundthe pile chanting his incantations for hours, till sheer exhaustion obliges him to desist, whenhis place is taken by his assistant. Water is sprinkled on the stone and huge fires are kindled.No layman may approach the sacred spot while the mystic ceremony is being performed.When the Sulka of New Britain wish to procure rain they blacken stones with the ashes ofcertain fruits and set them out, along with certain other plants and buds, in the sun. Then ahandful of twigs is dipped in water and weighted with stones, while a spell is chanted. Afterthat rain should follow. In Manipur, on a lofty hill to the east of the capital, there is a stonewhich the popular imagination likens to an umbrella. When rain is wanted, the rajah fetcheswater from a spring below and sprinkles it on the stone. At Sagami in Japan there is a stonewhich draws down rain whenever water is poured on it. When the Wakondyo, a tribe ofCentral Africa, desire rain, they send to the Wawamba, who dwell at the foot of snowy moun-tains, and are the happy possessors of a “rain-stone.” In consideration of a proper payment,the Wawamba wash the precious stone, anoint it with oil, and put it in a pot full of water. Afterthat the rain cannot fail to come. In the arid wastes of Arizona and New Mexico the Apachessought to make rain by carrying water from a certain spring and throwing it on a particularpoint high up on a rock; after that they imagined that the clouds would soon gather, and thatrain would begin to fall.But customs of this sort are not confined to the wilds of Africa and Asia or the torrid deserts ofAustralia and the New World. They have been practised in the cool air and under the greyskies of Europe. There is a fountain called Barenton, of romantic fame, in those “wild woodsof Broceliande,” where, if legend be true, the wizard Merlin still sleeps his magic slumber inthe hawthorn shade. Thither the Breton peasants used to resort when they needed rain. Theycaught some of the water in a tankard and threw it on a slab near the spring. On Snowdonthere is a lonely tarn called Dulyn, or the Black Lake, lying “in a dismal dingle surrounded byhigh and dangerous rocks.” A row of stepping-stones runs out into the lake, and if any onesteps on the stones and throws water so as to wet the farthest stone, which is called the RedAltar, “it is but a chance that you do not get rain before night, even when it is hot weather.” Inthese cases it appears probable that, as in Samoa, the stone is regarded as more or lessdivine. This appears from the custom sometimes observed of dipping a cross in the Fountainof Barenton to procure rain, for this is plainly a Christian substitute for the old pagan way ofthrowing water on the stone. At various places in France it is, or used till lately to be, thepractice to dip the image of a saint in water as a means of procuring rain. Thus, beside theold priory of Commagny, there is a spring of St. Gervais, whither the inhabitants go in proces-sion to obtain rain or fine weather according to the needs of the crops. In times of greatdrought they throw into the basin of the fountain an ancient stone image of the saint thatstands in a sort of niche from which the fountain flows. At Collobrières and Carpentras a simi-lar practice was observed with the images of St. Pons and St. Gens respectively. In severalvillages of Navarre prayers for rain used to be offered to St. Peter, and by way of enforcingthem the villagers carried the image of the saint in procession to the river, where they thriceinvited him to reconsider his resolution and to grant their prayers; then, if he was still obsti-nate, they plunged him in the water, despite the remonstrances of the clergy, who pleadedwith as much truth as piety that a simple caution or admonition administered to the imagewould produce an equally good effect. After this the rain was sure to fall within twenty-fourPage 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"hours. Catholic countries do not enjoy a monopoly of making rain by ducking holy images inwater. In Mingrelia, when the crops are suffering from want of rain, they take a particularlyholy image and dip it in water every day till a shower falls; and in the Far East the Shansdrench the images of Buddha with water when the rice is perishing of drought. In all suchcases the practice is probably at bottom a sympathetic charm, however it may be disguisedunder the appearance of a punishment or a threat.Like other peoples, the Greeks and Romans sought to obtain rain by magic, when prayersand processions had proved ineffectual. For example, in Arcadia, when the corn and treeswere parched with drought, the priest of Zeus dipped an oak branch into a certain spring onMount Lycaeus. Thus troubled, the water sent up a misty cloud, from which rain soon fellupon the land. A similar mode of making rain is still practised, as we have seen, in Halmaheranear New Guinea. The people of Crannon in Thessaly had a bronze chariot which they keptin a temple. When they desired a shower they shook the chariot and the shower fell. Probablythe rattling of the chariot was meant to imitate thunder; we have already seen that mock thun-der and lightning form part of a rain-charm in Russia and Japan. The legendary Salmoneus,King of Elis, made mock thunder by dragging bronze kettles behind his chariot, or by drivingover a bronze bridge, while he hurled blazing torches in imitation of lightning. It was his impi-ous wish to mimic the thundering car of Zeus as it rolled across the vault of heaven. Indeedhe declared that he was actually Zeus, and caused sacrifices to be offered to himself as such.Near a temple of Mars, outside the walls of Rome, there was kept a certain stone known asthe lapis manalis. In time of drought the stone was dragged into Rome, and this was sup-posed to bring down rain immediately.3. THE MAGICAL CONTROL OF THE SUNAs the magician thinks he can make rain, so he fancies he can cause the sun to shine, andcan hasten or stay its going down. At an eclipse the Ojebways used to imagine that the sunwas being extinguished. So they shot fire-tipped arrows in the air, hoping thus to rekindle hisexpiring light. The Sencis of Peru also shot burning arrows at the sun during an eclipse, butapparently they did this not so much to relight his lamp as to drive away a savage beast withwhich they supposed him to be struggling. Conversely during an eclipse of the moon sometribes of the Orinoco used to bury lighted brands in the ground; because, said they, if themoon were to be extinguished, all fire on earth would be extinguished with her, except suchas was hidden from her sight. During an eclipse of the sun the Kamtchatkans were wont tobring out fire from their huts and pray the great luminary to shine as before. But the prayeraddressed to the sun shows that this ceremony was religious rather than magical. Purelymagical, on the other hand, was the ceremony observed on similar occasions by the ChilcotinIndians. Men and women tucked up their robes, as they do in travelling, and then leaning onstaves, as if they were heavy laden, they continued to walk in a circle till the eclipse was over.Apparently they thought thus to support the failing steps of the sun as he trod his wearyround in the sky. Similarly in ancient Egypt the king, as the representative of the sun, walkedsolemnly round the walls of a temple in order to ensure that the sun should perform his dailyjourney round the sky without the interruption of an eclipse or other mishap. And after theautumnal equinox the ancient Egyptians held a festival called “the nativity of the sun’s walk-ing-stick,” because, as the luminary declined daily in the sky, and his light and heat dimin-ished, he was supposed to need a staff on which to lean. In New Caledonia when a wizarddesires to make sunshine, he takes some plants and corals to the burial-ground, and fashionsthem into a bundle, adding two locks of hair cut from a living child of his family, also two teethor an entire jawbone from the skeleton of an ancestor. He then climbs a mountain whose topPage 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"catches the first rays of the morning sun. Here he deposits three sorts of plants on a flatstone, places a branch of dry coral beside them, and hangs the bundle of charms over thestone. Next morning he returns to the spot and sets fire to the bundle at the moment whenthe sun rises from the sea. As the smoke curls up, he rubs the stone with the dry coral,invokes his ancestors and says: “Sun! I do this that you may be burning hot, and eat up allthe clouds in the sky.” The same ceremony is repeated at sunset. The New Caledonians alsomake a drought by means of a disc-shaped stone with a hole in it. At the moment when thesun rises, the wizard holds the stone in his hand and passes a burning brand repeatedly intothe hole, while he says: “I kindle the sun, in order that he may eat up the clouds and dry upour land, so that it may produce nothing.” The Banks Islanders make sunshine by means of amock sun. They take a very round stone, called a vat loa or sunstone, wind red braid about it,and stick it with owls’ feathers to represent rays, singing the proper spell in a low voice. Thenthey hang it on some high tree, such as a banyan or a casuarina, in a sacred place.The offering made by the Brahman in the morning is supposed to produce the sun, and weare told that “assuredly it would not rise, were he not to make that offering.” The ancientMexicans conceived the sun as the source of all vital force; hence they named himIpalnemohuani, “He by whom men live.” But if he bestowed life on the world, he needed alsoto receive life from it. And as the heart is the seat and symbol of life, bleeding hearts of menand animals were presented to the sun to maintain him in vigour and enable him to run hiscourse across the sky. Thus the Mexican sacrifices to the sun were magical rather than reli-gious, being designed, not so much to please and propitiate him, as physically to renew hisenergies of heat, light, and motion. The constant demand for human victims to feed the solarfire was met by waging war every year on the neighbouring tribes and bringing back troops ofcaptives to be sacrificed on the altar. Thus the ceaseless wars of the Mexicans and their cruelsystem of human sacrifices, the most monstrous on record, sprang in great measure from amistaken theory of the solar system. No more striking illustration could be given of the disas-trous consequences that may flow in practice from a purely speculative error. The ancientGreeks believed that the sun drove in a chariot across the sky; hence the Rhodians, whoworshipped the sun as their chief deity, annually dedicated a chariot and four horses to him,and flung them into the sea for his use. Doubtless they thought that after a year’s work his oldhorses and chariot would be worn out. From a like motive, probably, the idolatrous kings ofJudah dedicated chariots and horses to the sun, and the Spartans, Persians, andMassagetae sacrificed horses to him. The Spartans performed the sacrifice on the top ofMount Taygetus, the beautiful range behind which they saw the great luminary set everynight. It was as natural for the inhabitants of the valley of Sparta to do this as it was for theislanders of Rhodes to throw the chariot and horses into the sea, into which the sun seemedto them to sink at evening. For thus, whether on the mountain or in the sea, the fresh horsesstood ready for the weary god where they would be most welcome, at the end of his day’sjourney. As some people think they can light up the sun or speed him on his way, so others fancy theycan retard or stop him. In a pass of the Peruvian Andes stand two ruined towers on oppositehills. Iron hooks are clamped into their walls for the purpose of stretching a net from onetower to the other. The net is intended to catch the sun. Stories of men who have caught thesun in a noose are widely spread. When the sun is going southward in the autumn, and sink-ing lower and lower in the Arctic sky, the Esquimaux of Iglulik play the game of cat’s cradle inorder to catch him in the meshes of the string and so prevent his disappearance. On the con-trary, when the sun is moving northward in the spring, they play the game of cup-and-ball tohasten his return. When an Australian blackfellow wishes to stay the sun from going down tillPage 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"he gets home, he puts a sod in the fork of a tree, exactly facing the setting sun. On the otherhand, to make it go down faster, the Australians throw sand into the air and blow with theirmouths towards the sun, perhaps to waft the lingering orb westward and bury it under thesands into which it appears to sink at night.As some people imagine they can hasten the sun, so others fancy they can jog the tardymoon. The natives of New Guinea reckon months by the moon, and some of them have beenknown to throw stones and spears at the moon, in order to accelerate its progress and so tohasten the return of their friends, who were away from home for twelve months working on atobacco plantation. The Malays think that a bright glow at sunset may throw a weak personinto a fever. Hence they attempt to extinguish the glow by spitting out water and throwingashes at it. The Shuswap Indians believe that they can bring on cold weather by burning thewood of a tree that has been struck by lightning. The belief may be based on the observationthat in their country cold follows a thunder-storm. Hence in spring, when these Indians aretravelling over the snow on high ground, they burn splinters of such wood in the fire in orderthat the crust of the snow may not melt.4. THE MAGICAL CONTROL OF THE WINDOnce more, the savage thinks he can make the wind to blow or to be still. When the day ishot and a Yakut has a long way to go, he takes a stone which he has chanced to find in ananimal or fish, winds a horse-hair several times round it, and ties it to a stick. He then wavesthe stick about, uttering a spell. Soon a cool breeze begins to blow. In order to procure a coolwind for nine days the stone should first be dipped in the blood of a bird or beast and thenpresented to the sun, while the sorcerer makes three turns contrary to the course of the lumi-nary. If a Hottentot desires the wind to drop, he takes one of his fattest skins and hangs it onthe end of a pole, in the belief that by blowing the skin down the wind will lose all its force andmust itself fall. Fuegian wizards throw shells against the wind to make it drop. The natives ofthe island of Bibili, off New Guinea, are reputed to make wind by blowing with their mouths. Instormy weather the Bogadjim people say, “The Bibili folk are at it again, blowing away.”Another way of making wind which is practised in New Guinea is to strike a “wind-stone” light-ly with a stick; to strike it hard would bring on a hurricane. So in Scotland witches used toraise the wind by dipping a rag in water and beating it thrice on a stone, saying: “I knok this rag upone this stane To raise the wind in the divellis name, It sall not lye till I please againe.”In Greenland a woman in child-bed and for some time after delivery is supposed to possessthe power of laying a storm. She has only to go out of doors, fill her mouth with air, and com-ing back into the house blow it out again. In antiquity there was a family at Corinth whichenjoyed the reputation of being able to still the raging wind; but we do not know in what man-ner its members exercised a useful function, which probably earned for them a more solidrecompense than mere repute among the seafaring population of the isthmus. Even inChristian times, under the reign of Constantine, a certain Sopater suffered death atConstantinople on a charge of binding the winds by magic, because it happened that thecorn-ships of Egypt and Syria were detained afar off by calms or head-winds, to the rage anddisappointment of the hungry Byzantine rabble. Finnish wizards used to sell wind to storm-stayed mariners. The wind was enclosed in three knots; if they undid the first knot, a moder-ate wind sprang up; if the second, it blew half a gale; if the third, a hurricane. Indeed thePage 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Esthonians, whose country is divided from Finland only by an arm of the sea, still believe inthe magical powers of their northern neighbours. The bitter winds that blow in spring from thenorth and north-east, bringing ague and rheumatic inflammations in their train, are set downby the simple Esthonian peasantry to the machinations of the Finnish wizards and witches. Inparticular they regard with special dread three days in spring to which they give the name ofDays of the Cross; one of them falls on the Eve of Ascension Day. The people in the neigh-bourhood of Fellin fear to go out on these days lest the cruel winds from Lappland shouldsmite them dead. A popular Esthonian song runs: Wind of the Cross! rushing and mighty! Heavy the blow of thy wings sweeping past! Wild wailing wind of misfortune and sorrow, Wizards of Finland ride by on the blast.It is said, too, that sailors, beating up against the wind in the Gulf of Finland, sometimes seea strange sail heave in sight astern and overhaul them hand over hand. On she comes with acloud of canvas—all her studding—sails out—right in the teeth of the wind, forging her waythrough the foaming billows, dashing back the spray in sheets from her cutwater, every sailswollen to bursting, every rope strained to cracking. Then the sailors know that she hails fromFinland.The art of tying up the wind in three knots, so that the more knots are loosed the stronger willblow the wind, has been attributed to wizards in Lappland and to witches in Shetland, Lewis,and the Isle of Man. Shetland seamen still buy winds in the shape of knotted handkerchiefs orthreads from old women who claim to rule the storms. There are said to be ancient crones inLerwick now who live by selling wind. Ulysses received the winds in a leathern bag fromAeolus, King of the Winds. The Motumotu in New Guinea think that storms are sent by anOiabu sorcerer; for each wind he has a bamboo which he opens at pleasure. On the top ofMount Agu in Togo, a district of West Africa, resides a fetish called Bagba, who is supposedto control the wind and the rain. His priest is said to keep the winds shut up in great pots.Often the stormy wind is regarded as an evil being who may be intimidated, driven away, orkilled. When storms and bad weather have lasted long and food is scarce with the CentralEsquimaux, they endeavour to conjure the tempest by making a long whip of seaweed,armed with which they go down to the beach and strike out in the direction of the wind, crying“Taba (it is enough)!” Once when north-westerly winds had kept the ice long on the coast andfood was becoming scarce, the Esquimaux performed a ceremony to make a calm. A fire waskindled on the shore, and the men gathered round it and chanted. An old man then steppedup to the fire and in a coaxing voice invited the demon of the wind to come under the fire andwarm himself. When he was supposed to have arrived, a vessel of water, to which each manpresent had contributed, was thrown on the flames by an old man, and immediately a flight ofarrows sped towards the spot where the fire had been. They thought that the demon wouldnot stay where he had been so badly treated. To complete the effect, guns were dischargedin various directions, and the captain of a European vessel was invited to fire on the wind withcannon. On the twenty-first of February 1883 a similar ceremony was performed by theEsquimaux of Point Barrow, Alaska, with the intention of killing the spirit of the wind. Womendrove the demon from their houses with clubs and knives, with which they made passes inthe air; and the men, gathering round a fire, shot him with their rifles and crushed him under aheavy stone the moment that steam rose in a cloud from the smouldering embers, on which atub of water had just been thrown.Page 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Lengua Indians of the Gran Chaco ascribe the rush of a whirl-wind to the passage of aspirit and they fling sticks at it to frighten it away. When the wind blows down their huts, thePayaguas of South America snatch up firebrands and run against the wind, menacing it withthe blazing brands, while others beat the air with their fists to frighten the storm. When theGuaycurus are threatened by a severe storm, the men go out armed, and the women andchildren scream their loudest to intimidate the demon. During a tempest the inhabitants of aBatak village in Sumatra have been seen to rush from their houses armed with sword andlance. The rajah placed himself at their head, and with shouts and yells they hewed andhacked at the invisible foe. An old woman was observed to be specially active in the defenceof her house, slashing the air right and left with a long sabre. In a violent thunderstorm, thepeals sounding very near, the Kayans of Borneo have been seen to draw their swords threat-eningly half out of their scabbards, as if to frighten away the demons of the storm. In Australiathe huge columns of red sand that move rapidly across a desert tract are thought by thenatives to be spirits passing along. Once an athletic young black ran after one of these mov-ing columns to kill it with boomerangs. He was away two or three hours, and came back veryweary, saying he had killed Koochee (the demon), but that Koochee had growled at him andhe must die. Of the Bedouins of Eastern Africa it is said that “no whirl-wind ever sweepsacross the path without being pursued by a dozen savages with drawn creeses, who stab intothe centre of the dusty column in order to drive away the evil spirit that is believed to be ridingon the blast.” In the light of these examples a story told by Herodotus, which his modern critics have treat-ed as a fable, is perfectly credible. He says, without however vouching for the truth of thetale, that once in the land of the Psylli, the modern Tripoli, the wind blowing from the Saharahad dried up all the water-tanks. So the people took counsel and marched in a body to makewar on the south wind. But when they entered the desert the simoon swept down on themand buried them to a man. The story may well have been told by one who watched them dis-appearing, in battle array, with drums and cymbals beating, into the red cloud of whirlingsand.Chapter VIMagicians as KingsTHE foregoing evidence may satisfy us that in many lands and many races magic hasclaimed to control the great forces of nature for the good of man. If that has been so, thepractitioners of the art must necessarily be personages of importance and influence in anysociety which puts faith in their extravagant pretensions, and it would be no matter for sur-prise if, by virtue of the reputation which they enjoy and of the awe which they inspire, someof them should attain to the highest position of authority over their credulous fellows. In pointof fact magicians appear to have often developed into chiefs and kings.Let us begin by looking at the lowest race of men as to whom we possess comparatively fulland accurate information, the aborigines of Australia. These savages are ruled neither bychiefs nor kings. So far as their tribes can be said to have a political constitution, it is ademocracy or rather an oligarchy of old and influential men, who meet in council and decideon all measures of importance to the practical exclusion of the younger men. Their delibera-tive assembly answers to the senate of later times: if we had to coin a word for such a gov-ernment of elders we might call it a gerontocracy. The elders who in aboriginal Australia thusmeet and direct the affairs of their tribe appear to be for the most part the headmen of theirPage 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"respective totem clans. Now in Central Australia, where the desert nature of the country andthe almost complete isolation from foreign influences have retarded progress and preservedthe natives on the whole in their most primitive state, the headmen of the various totem clansare charged with the important task of performing magical ceremonies for the multiplication ofthe totems, and as the great majority of the totems are edible animals or plants, it follows thatthese men are commonly expected to provide the people with food by means of magic.Others have to make the rain to fall or to render other services to the community. In short,among the tribes of Central Australia the headmen are public magicians. Further, their mostimportant function is to take charge of the sacred storehouse, usually a cleft in the rocks or ahole in the ground, where are kept the holy stones and sticks (churinga) with which the soulsof all the people, both living and dead, are apparently supposed to be in a manner bound up.Thus while the headmen have certainly to perform what we should call civil duties, such as toinflict punishment for breaches of tribal custom, their principal functions are sacred or magi-cal.When we pass from Australia to New Guinea we find that, though the natives stand at a farhigher level of culture than the Australian aborigines, the constitution of society among themis still essentially democratic or oligarchic, and chieftainship exists only in embryo. Thus SirWilliam MacGregor tells us that in British New Guinea no one has ever arisen wise enough,bold enough, and strong enough to become the despot even of a single district. “The nearestapproach to this has been the very distant one of some person becoming a renowned wizard;but that has only resulted in levying a certain amount of blackmail.”According to a native account, the origin of the power of Melanesian chiefs lies entirely in thebelief that they have communication with mighty ghosts, and wield that supernatural powerwhereby they can bring the influence of the ghosts to bear. If a chief imposed a fine, it waspaid because the people universally dreaded his ghostly power, and firmly believed that hecould inflict calamity and sickness upon such as resisted him. As soon as any considerablenumber of his people began to disbelieve in his influence with the ghosts, his power to levyfines was shaken. Again, Dr. George Brown tells us that in New Britain “a ruling chief wasalways supposed to exercise priestly functions, that is, he professed to be in constant com-munication with the tebarans (spirits), and through their influence he was enabled to bringrain or sunshine, fair winds or foul ones, sickness or health, success or disaster in war, andgenerally to procure any blessing or curse for which the applicant was willing to pay a suffi-cient price.” Still rising in the scale of culture we come to Africa, where both the chieftainship and the king-ship are fully developed; and here the evidence for the evolution of the chief out of the magi-cian, and especially out of the rain-maker, is comparatively plentiful. Thus among theWambugwe, a Bantu people of East Africa, the original form of government was a familyrepublic, but the enormous power of the sorcerers, transmitted by inheritance, soon raisedthem to the rank of petty lords or chiefs. Of the three chiefs living in the country in 1894 twowere much dreaded as magicians, and the wealth of cattle they possessed came to themalmost wholly in the shape of presents bestowed for their services in that capacity. Their prin-cipal art was that of rain-making. The chiefs of the Wataturu, another people of East Africa,are said to be nothing but sorcerers destitute of any direct political influence. Again, amongthe Wagogo of East Africa the main power of the chiefs, we are told, is derived from their artof rain-making. If a chief cannot make rain himself, he must procure it from some one whocan.Page 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Again, among the tribes of the Upper Nile the medicine-men are generally the chiefs. Theirauthority rests above all upon their supposed power of making rain, for “rain is the one thingwhich matters to the people in those districts, as if it does not come down at the right time itmeans untold hardships for the community. It is therefore small wonder that men more cun-ning than their fellows should arrogate to themselves the power of producing it, or that havinggained such a reputation, they should trade on the credulity of their simpler neighbours.”Hence “most of the chiefs of these tribes are rain-makers, and enjoy a popularity in proportionto their powers to give rain to their people at the proper season.... Rain-making chiefs alwaysbuild their villages on the slopes of a fairly high hill, as they no doubt know that the hillsattract the clouds, and that they are, therefore, fairly safe in their weather forecasts.” Each ofthese rain-makers has a number of rain-stones, such as rock-crystal, aventurine, andamethyst, which he keeps in a pot. When he wishes to produce rain he plunges the stones inwater, and taking in his hand a peeled cane, which is split at the top, he beckons with it to theclouds to come or waves them away in the way they should go, muttering an incantation thewhile. Or he pours water and the entrails of a sheep or goat into a hollow in a stone and thensprinkles the water towards the sky. Though the chief acquires wealth by the exercise of hissupposed magical powers, he often, perhaps generally, comes to a violent end; for in time ofdrought the angry people assemble and kill him, believing that it is he who prevents the rainfrom falling. Yet the office is usually hereditary and passes from father to son. Among thetribes which cherish these beliefs and observe these customs are the Latuka, Bari, Laluba,and Lokoiya.In Central Africa, again, the Lendu tribe, to the west of Lake Albert, firmly believe that certainpeople possess the power of making rain. Among them the rain-maker either is a chief oralmost invariably becomes one. The Banyoro also have a great respect for the dispensers ofrain, whom they load with a profusion of gifts. The great dispenser, he who has absolute anduncontrollable power over the rain, is the king; but he can depute his power to other persons,so that the benefit may be distributed and the heavenly water laid on over the various parts ofthe kingdom.In Western as well as in Eastern and Central Africa we meet with the same union of chieflywith magical functions. Thus in the Fan tribe the strict distinction between chief and medicine-man does not exist. The chief is also a medicine-man and a smith to boot; for the Fansesteem the smith’s craft sacred, and none but chiefs may meddle with it.As to the relation between the offices of chief and rain-maker in South Africa a well-informedwriter observes: “In very old days the chief was the great Rain-maker of the tribe. Somechiefs allowed no one else to compete with them, lest a successful Rain-maker should bechosen as chief. There was also another reason: the Rain-maker was sure to become a richman if he gained a great reputation, and it would manifestly never do for the chief to allowany one to be too rich. The Rain-maker exerts tremendous control over the people, and so itwould be most important to keep this function connected with royalty. Tradition always placesthe power of making rain as the fundamental glory of ancient chiefs and heroes, and it seemsprobable that it may have been the origin of chieftainship. The man who made the rain wouldnaturally become the chief. In the same way Chaka [the famous Zulu despot] used to declarethat he was the only diviner in the country, for if he allowed rivals his life would be insecure.”Similarly speaking of the South African tribes in general, Dr. Moffat says that “the rain-makeris in the estimation of the people no mean personage, possessing an influence over theminds of the people superior even to that of the king, who is likewise compelled to yield to thedictates of this arch-official.” Page 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The foregoing evidence renders it probable that in Africa the king has often been developedout of the public magician, and especially out of the rain-maker. The unbounded fear whichthe magician inspires and the wealth which he amasses in the exercise of his profession mayboth be supposed to have contributed to his promotion. But if the career of a magician andespecially of a rain-maker offers great rewards to the successful practitioner of the art, it isbeset with many pitfalls into which the unskilful or unlucky artist may fall. The position of thepublic sorcerer is indeed a very precarious one; for where the people firmly believe that hehas it in his power to make the rain to fall, the sun to shine, and the fruits of the earth to grow,they naturally impute drought and dearth to his culpable negligence or wilful obstinacy, andthey punish him accordingly. Hence in Africa the chief who fails to procure rain is often exiledor killed. Thus, in some parts of West Africa, when prayers and offerings presented to theking have failed to procure rain, his subjects bind him with ropes and take him by force to thegrave of his forefathers that he may obtain from them the needed rain. The Banjars in WestAfrica ascribe to their king the power of causing rain or fine weather. So long as the weatheris fine they load him with presents of grain and cattle. But if long drought or rain threatens tospoil the crops, they insult and beat him till the weather changes. When the harvest fails orthe surf on the coast is too heavy to allow of fishing, the people of Loango accuse their kingof a “bad heart” and depose him. On the Grain Coast the high priest or fetish king, who bearsthe title of Bodio, is responsible for the health of the community, the fertility of the earth, andthe abundance of fish in the sea and rivers; and if the country suffers in any of these respectsthe Bodio is deposed from his office. In Ussukuma, a great district on the southern bank ofthe Victoria Nyanza, “the rain and locust question is part and parcel of the Sultan’s govern-ment. He, too, must know how to make rain and drive away the locusts. If he and his medi-cine-men are unable to accomplish this, his whole existence is at stake in times of distress.On a certain occasion, when the rain so greatly desired by the people did not come, theSultan was simply driven out (in Ututwa, near Nassa). The people, in fact, hold that rulersmust have power over Nature and her phenomena.” Again, we are told of the natives of theNyanaza region generally that “they are persuaded that rain only falls as a result of magic,and the important duty of causing it to descend devolves on the chief of the tribe. If rain doesnot come at the proper time, everybody complains. More than one petty king has been ban-ished his country because of drought.” Among the Latuka of the Upper Nile, when the cropsare withering, and all the efforts of the chief to draw down rain have proved fruitless, the peo-ple commonly attack him by night, rob him of all he possesses, and drive him away. But oftenthey kill him.In many other parts of the world kings have been expected to regulate the course of naturefor the good of their people and have been punished if they failed to do so. It appears that theScythians, when food was scarce, used to put their king in bonds. In ancient Egypt the sacredkings were blamed for the failure of the crops, but the sacred beasts were also held responsi-ble for the course of nature. When pestilence and other calamities had fallen on the land, inconsequence of a long and severe drought, the priests took the animals by night and threat-ened them, but if the evil did not abate they slew the beasts. On the coral island of Niue orSavage Island, in the South Pacific, there formerly reigned a line of kings. But as the kingswere also high priests, and were supposed to make the food grow, the people became angrywith them in times of scarcity and killed them; till at last, as one after another was killed, noone would be king, and the monarchy came to an end. Ancient Chinese writers inform us thatin Corea the blame was laid on the king whenever too much or too little rain fell and the cropsdid not ripen. Some said that he must be deposed, others that he must be slain.Page 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Among the American Indians the furthest advance towards civilisation was made under themonarchical and theocratic governments of Mexico and Peru; but we know too little of theearly history of these countries to say whether the predecessors of their deified kings weremedicine-men or not. Perhaps a trace of such a succession may be detected in the oathwhich the Mexican kings, when they mounted the throne, swore that they would make the sunto shine, the clouds to give rain, the rivers to flow, and the earth to bring forth fruits in abun-dance. Certainly, in aboriginal America the sorcerer or medicine-man, surrounded by a halo ofmystery and an atmosphere of awe, was a personage of great influence and importance, andhe may well have developed into a chief or king in many tribes, though positive evidence ofsuch a development appears to be lacking. Thus Catlin tells us that in North America themedicine-men “are valued as dignitaries in the tribe, and the greatest respect is paid to themby the whole community; not only for their skill in their materia medica, but more especiallyfor their tact in magic and mysteries, in which they all deal to a very great extent.... In alltribes their doctors are conjurers—are magicians—are sooth-sayers, and I had like to havesaid high-priests, inasmuch as they superintend and conduct all their religious ceremonies;they are looked upon by all as oracles of the nation. In all councils of war and peace, theyhave a seat with the chiefs, are regularly consulted before any public step is taken, and thegreatest deference and respect is paid to their opinions.” Similarly in California “the shamanwas, and still is, perhaps the most important individual among the Maidu. In the absence ofany definite system of government, the word of a shaman has great weight: as a class theyare regarded with much awe, and as a rule are obeyed much more than the chief.” In South America also the magicians or medicine-men seem to have been on the highroad tochieftainship or kingship. One of the earliest settlers on the coast of Brazil, the FrenchmanThevet, reports that the Indians “hold these pages (or medicine-men) in such honour and rev-erence that they adore, or rather idolise them. You may see the common folk go to meetthem, prostrate themselves, and pray to them, saying, ‘Grant that I be not ill, that I do not die,neither I nor my children,’ or some such request. And he answers, ‘You shall not die, you shallnot be ill,’ and such like replies. But sometimes if it happens that these pages do not tell thetruth, and things turn out otherwise than they predicted, the people make no scruple of killingthem as unworthy of the title and dignity of pages.” Among the Lengua Indians of the GranChaco every clan has its cazique or chief, but he possesses little authority. In virtue of hisoffice he has to make many presents, so he seldom grows rich and is generally more shabbi-ly clad than any of his subjects. “As a matter of fact the magician is the man who has mostpower in his hands, and he is accustomed to receive presents instead of to give them.” It isthe magician’s duty to bring down misfortune and plagues on the enemies of his tribe, and toguard his own people against hostile magic. For these services he is well paid, and by themhe acquires a position of great influence and authority.Throughout the Malay region the rajah or king is commonly regarded with superstitious vener-ation as the possessor of supernatural powers, and there are grounds for thinking that he too,like apparently so many African chiefs, has been developed out of a simple magician. At thepresent day the Malays firmly believe that the king possesses a personal influence over theworks of nature, such as the growth of the crops and the bearing of fruit-trees. The same pro-lific virtue is supposed to reside, though in a lesser degree, in his delegates, and even in thepersons of Europeans who chance to have charge of districts. Thus in Selangor, one of thenative states of the Malay Peninsula, the success or failure of the rice-crops is often attributedto a change of district officers. The Toorateyas of Southern Celebes hold that the prosperity ofthe rice depends on the behaviour of their princes, and that bad government, by which theymean a government which does not conform to ancient custom, will result in a failure of thePage 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"crops.The Dyaks of Sarawak believed that their famous English ruler, Rajah Brooke, was endowedwith a certain magical virtue which, if properly applied, could render the rice-crops abundant.Hence when he visited a tribe, they used to bring him the seed which they intended to sownext year, and he fertilised it by shaking over it the women’s necklaces, which had been pre-viously dipped in a special mixture. And when he entered a village, the women would washand bathe his feet, first with water, and then with the milk of a young coco-nut, and lastly withwater again, and all this water which had touched his person they preserved for the purposeof distributing it on their farms, believing that it ensured an abundant harvest. Tribes whichwere too far off for him to visit used to send him a small piece of white cloth and a little goldor silver, and when these things had been impregnated by his generative virtue they buriedthem in their fields, and confidently expected a heavy crop. Once when a European remarkedthat the rice-crops of the Samban tribe were thin, the chief immediately replied that they couldnot be otherwise, since Rajah Brooke had never visited them, and he begged that Mr. Brookemight be induced to visit his tribe and remove the sterility of their land.The belief that kings possess magical or supernatural powers by virtue of which they can fer-tilise the earth and confer other benefits on their subjects would seem to have been sharedby the ancestors of all the Aryan races from India to Ireland, and it has left clear traces ofitself in our own country down to modern times. Thus the ancient Hindoo law-book called TheLaws of Manu describes as follows the effects of a good king’s reign: “In that country wherethe king avoids taking the property of mortal sinners, men are born in due time and are long-lived. And the crops of the husbandmen spring up, each as it was sown, and the children dienot, and no misshaped offspring is born.” In Homeric Greece kings and chiefs were spoken ofas sacred or divine; their houses, too, were divine and their chariots sacred; and it wasthought that the reign of a good king caused the black earth to bring forth wheat and barley,the trees to be loaded with fruit, the flocks to multiply, and the sea to yield fish. In the MiddleAges, when Waldemar I., King of Denmark, travelled in Germany, mothers brought theirinfants and husbandmen their seed for him to lay his hands on, thinking that children wouldboth thrive the better for the royal touch, and for a like reason farmers asked him to throw theseed for them. It was the belief of the ancient Irish that when their kings observed the cus-toms of their ancestors, the seasons were mild, the crops plentiful, the cattle fruitful, thewaters abounded with fish, and the fruit trees had to be propped up on account of the weightof their produce. A canon attributed to St. Patrick enumerates among the blessings thatattend the reign of a just king “fine weather, calm seas, crops abundant, and trees laden withfruit.” On the other hand, dearth, dryness of cows, blight of fruit, and scarcity of corn wereregarded as infallible proofs that the reigning king was bad.Perhaps the last relic of such superstitions which lingered about our English kings was thenotion that they could heal scrofula by their touch. The disease was accordingly known as theKing’s Evil. Queen Elizabeth often exercised this miraculous gift of healing. On MidsummerDay 1633, Charles the First cured a hundred patients at one swoop in the chapel royal atHolyrood. But it was under his son Charles the Second that the practice seems to haveattained its highest vogue. It is said that in the course of his reign Charles the Secondtouched near a hundred thousand persons for scrofula. The press to get near him was some-times terrific. On one occasion six or seven of those who came to be healed were trampled todeath. The cool-headed William the Third contemptuously refused to lend himself to thehocuspocus; and when his palace was besieged by the usual unsavoury crowd, he orderedthem to be turned away with a dole. On the only occasion when he was importuned into lay-Page 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"ing his hand on a patient, he said to him, “God give you better health and more sense.”However, the practice was continued, as might have been expected, by the dull bigot Jamesthe Second and his dull daughter Queen Anne.The kings of France also claimed to possess the same gift of healing by touch, which theyare said to have derived from Clovis or from St. Louis, while our English kings inherited itfrom Edward the Confessor. Similarly the savage chiefs of Tonga were believed to heal scrof-ula and cases of indurated liver by the touch of their feet; and the cure was strictly homoeo-pathic, for the disease as well as the cure was thought to be caused by contact with the royalperson or with anything that belonged to it.On the whole, then, we seem to be justified in inferring that in many parts of the world theking is the lineal successor of the old magician or medicine-man. When once a special classof sorcerers has been segregated from the community and entrusted by it with the dischargeof duties on which the public safety and welfare are believed to depend, these men graduallyrise to wealth and power, till their leaders blossom out into sacred kings. But the great socialrevolution which thus begins with democracy and ends in despotism is attended by an intel-lectual revolution which affects both the conception and the functions of royalty. For as timegoes on, the fallacy of magic becomes more and more apparent to the acuter minds and isslowly displaced by religion; in other words, the magician gives way to the priest, who,renouncing the attempt to control directly the processes of nature for the good of man, seeksto attain the same end indirectly by appealing to the gods to do for him what he no longerfancies he can do for himself. Hence the king, starting as a magician, tends gradually toexchange the practice of magic for the priestly functions of prayer and sacrifice. And while thedistinction between the human and the divine is still imperfectly drawn, it is often imaginedthat men may themselves attain to godhead, not merely after their death, but in their lifetime,through the temporary or permanent possession of their whole nature by a great and powerfulspirit. No class of the community has benefited so much as kings by this belief in the possibleincarnation of a god in human form. The doctrine of that incarnation, and with it the theory ofthe divinity of kings in the strict sense of the word, will form the subject of the following chap-ter.Chapter VIIIncarnate Human GodsTHE instances which in the preceding chapters I have drawn from the beliefs and practices ofrude peoples all over the world, may suffice to prove that the savage fails to recognise thoselimitations to his power over nature which seem so obvious to us. In a society where everyman is supposed to be endowed more or less with powers which we should call supernatural,it is plain that the distinction between gods and men is somewhat blurred, or rather hasscarcely emerged. The conception of gods as superhuman beings endowed with powers towhich man possesses nothing comparable in degree and hardly even in kind, has been slow-ly evolved in the course of history. By primitive peoples the supernatural agents are notregarded as greatly, if at all, superior to man; for they may be frightened and coerced by himinto doing his will. At this stage of thought the world is viewed as a great democracy; allbeings in it, whether natural or supernatural, are supposed to stand on a footing of tolerableequality. But with the growth of his knowledge man learns to realise more clearly the vastnessof nature and his own littleness and feebleness in presence of it. The recognition of his help-lessness does not, however, carry with it a corresponding belief in the impotence of thosePage 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"supernatural beings with which his imagination peoples the universe. On the contrary, itenhances his conception of their power. For the idea of the world as a system of impersonalforces acting in accordance with fixed and invariable laws has not yet fully dawned or dark-ened upon him. The germ of the idea he certainly has, and he acts upon it, not only in magicart, but in much of the business of daily life. But the idea remains undeveloped, and so far ashe attempts to explain the world he lives in, he pictures it as the manifestation of consciouswill and personal agency. If then he feels himself to be so frail and slight, how vast and pow-erful must he deem the beings who control the gigantic machinery of nature! Thus as his oldsense of equality with the gods slowly vanishes, he resigns at the same time the hope ofdirecting the course of nature by his own unaided resources, that is, by magic, and looksmore and more to the gods as the sole repositories of those supernatural powers which heonce claimed to share with them. With the advance of knowledge, therefore, prayer and sacri-fice assume the leading place in religious ritual; and magic, which once ranked with them asa legitimate equal, is gradually relegated to the background and sinks to the level of a blackart. It is not regarded as an encroachment, at once vain and impious, on the domain of thegods, and as such encounters the steady opposition of the priests, whose reputation andinfluence rise or fall with those of their gods. Hence, when at a late period the distinctionbetween religion and superstition has emerged, we find that sacrifice and prayer are theresource of the pious and enlightened portion of the community, while magic is the refuge ofthe superstitious and ignorant. But when, still later, the conception of the elemental forces aspersonal agents is giving way to the recognition of natural law; then magic, based as it implic-itly is on the idea of a necessary and invariable sequence of cause and effect, independent ofpersonal will, reappears from the obscurity and discredit into which it had fallen, and by inves-tigating the causal sequences in nature, directly prepares the way for science. Alchemy leadsup to chemistry.The notion of a man-god, or of a human being endowed with divine or supernatural powers,belongs essentially to that earlier period of religious history in which gods and men are stillviewed as beings of much the same order, and before they are divided by the impassable gulfwhich, to later thought, opens out between them. Strange, therefore, as may seem to us theidea of a god incarnate in human form, it has nothing very startling for early man, who sees ina man-god or a god-man only a higher degree of the same supernatural powers which hearrogates in perfect good faith to himself. Nor does he draw any very sharp distinctionbetween a god and a powerful sorcerer. His gods are often merely invisible magicians whobehind the veil of nature work the same sort of charms and incantations which the humanmagician works in a visible and bodily form among his fellows. And as the gods are common-ly believed to exhibit themselves in the likeness of men to their worshippers, it is easy for themagician, with his supposed miraculous powers, to acquire the reputation of being an incar-nate deity. Thus beginning as little more than a simple conjurer, the medicine-man or magi-cian tends to blossom out into a full-blown god and king in one. Only in speaking of him as agod we must beware of importing into the savage conception of deity those very abstract andcomplex ideas which we attach to the term. Our ideas on this profound subject are the fruit ofa long intellectual and moral evolution, and they are so far from being shared by the savagethat he cannot even understand them when they are explained to him. Much of the controver-sy which has raged as to the religion of the lower races has sprung merely from a mutualmisunderstanding. The savage does not understand the thoughts of the civilised man, andfew civilised men understand the thoughts of the savage. When the savage uses his word forgod, he has in his mind a being of a certain sort: when the civilised man uses his word forgod, he has in his mind a being of a very different sort; and if, as commonly happens, the twomen are equally unable to place themselves at the other’s point of view, nothing but confu-Page 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"sion and mistakes can result from their discussions. If we civilised men insist on limiting thename of God to that particular conception of the divine nature which we ourselves haveformed, then we must confess that the savage has no god at all. But we shall adhere moreclosely to the facts of history if we allow most of the higher savages at least to possess arudimentary notion of certain supernatural beings who may fittingly be called gods, though notin the full sense in which we use the word. That rudimentary notion represents in all probabili-ty the germ out of which the civilised peoples have gradually evolved their own high concep-tions of deity; and if we could trace the whole course of religious development, we might findthat the chain which links our idea of the Godhead with that of the savage is one and unbro-ken.With these explanations and cautions I will now adduce some examples of gods who havebeen believed by their worshippers to be incarnate in living human beings, whether men orwomen. The persons in whom a deity is thought to reveal himself are by no means alwayskings or descendants of kings; the supposed incarnation may take place even in men of thehumblest rank. In India, for example, one human god started in life as a cotton-bleacher andanother as the son of a carpenter. I shall therefore not draw my examples exclusively fromroyal personages, as I wish to illustrate the general principle of the deification of living men, inother words, the incarnation of a deity in human form. Such incarnate gods are common inrude society. The incarnation may be temporary or permanent. In the former case, the incar-nation-commonly known as inspiration or possession-reveals itself in supernatural knowledgerather than in supernatural power. In other words, its usual manifestations are divination andprophecy rather than miracles. On the other hand, when the incarnation is not merely tempo-rary, when the divine spirit has permanently taken up its abode in a human body, the god-man is usually expected to vindicate his character by working miracles. Only we have toremember that by men at this stage of thought miracles are not considered as breaches ofnatural law. Not conceiving the existence of natural law, primitive man cannot conceive abreach of it. A miracle is to him merely an unusually striking manifestation of a commonpower.The belief in temporary incarnation or inspiration is world-wide. Certain persons are supposedto be possessed from time to time by a spirit or deity; while the possession lasts, their ownpersonality lies in abeyance, the presence of the spirit is revealed by convulsive shiveringsand shakings of the man’s whole body, by wild gestures and excited looks, all of which arereferred, not to the man himself, but to the spirit which has entered into him; and in thisabnormal state all his utterances are accepted as the voice of the god or spirit dwelling in himand speaking through him. Thus, for example, in the Sandwich Islands, the king, personatingthe god, uttered the responses of the oracle from his concealment in a frame of wicker-work.But in the southern islands of the Pacific the god “frequently entered the priest, who, inflatedas it were with the divinity, ceased to act or speak as a voluntary agent, but moved and spokeas entirely under supernatural influence. In this respect there was a striking resemblancebetween the rude oracles of the Polynesians, and those of the celebrated nations of ancientGreece. As soon as the god was supposed to have entered the priest, the latter became vio-lently agitated, and worked himself up to the highest pitch of apparent frenzy, the muscles ofthe limbs seemed convulsed, the body swelled, the countenance became terrific, the featuresdistorted, and the eyes wild and strained. In this state he often rolled on the earth, foaming atthe mouth, as if labouring under the influence of the divinity by whom he was possessed,and, in shrill cries, and violent and often indistinct sounds, revealed the will of the god. Thepriests, who were attending, and versed in the mysteries, received, and reported to the peo-ple, the declarations which had been thus received. When the priest had uttered the responsePage 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"of the oracle, the violent paroxysm gradually subsided, and comparative composure ensued.The god did not, however, always leave him as soon as the communication had been made.Sometimes the same taura, or priest, continued for two or three days possessed by the spiritor deity; a piece of a native cloth, of a peculiar kind, worn round one arm, was an indication ofinspiration, or of the indwelling of the god with the individual who wore it. The acts of the manduring this period were considered as those of the god, and hence the greatest attention waspaid to his expressions, and the whole of his deportment.... When uruhia (under the inspira-tion of the spirit), the priest was always considered as sacred as the god, and was called,during this period, atua, god, though at other times only denominated taura or priest.”But examples of such temporary inspiration are so common in every part of the world and arenow so familiar through books on ethnology that it is needless to multiply illustrations of thegeneral principle. It may be well, however, to refer to two particular modes of producing tem-porary inspiration, because they are perhaps less known than some others, and because weshall have occasion to refer to them later on. One of these modes of producing inspiration isby sucking the fresh blood of a sacrificed victim. In the temple of Apollo Diradiotes at Argos, alamb was sacrificed by night once a month; a woman, who had to observe a rule of chastity,tasted the blood of the lamb, and thus being inspired by the god she prophesied or divined. AtAegira in Achaia the priestess of Earth drank the fresh blood of a bull before she descendedinto the cave to prophesy. Similarly among the Kuruvikkarans, a class of bird-catchers andbeggars in Southern India, the goddess Kali is believed to descend upon the priest, and hegives oracular replies after sucking the blood which streams from the cut throat of a goat. At afestival of the Alfoors of Minahassa, in Northern Celebes, after a pig has been killed, thepriest rushes furiously at it, thrusts his head into the carcase, and drinks of the blood. Thenhe is dragged away from it by force and set on a chair, whereupon he begins to prophesyhow the rice-crop will turn out that year. A second time he runs at the carcase and drinks ofthe blood; a second time he is forced into the chair and continues his predictions. It is thoughtthat there is a spirit in him which possesses the power of prophecy.The other mode of producing temporary inspiration, to which I shall here refer, consists in theuse of a sacred tree or plant. Thus in the Hindoo Koosh a fire is kindled with twigs of thesacred cedar; and the Dainyal or sibyl, with a cloth over her head, inhales the thick pungentsmoke till she is seized with convulsions and falls senseless to the ground. Soon she risesand raises a shrill chant, which is caught up and loudly repeated by her audience. So Apollo’sprophetess ate the sacred laurel and was fumigated with it before she prophesied. TheBacchanals ate ivy, and their inspired fury was by some believed to be due to the excitingand intoxicating properties of the plant. In Uganda the priest, in order to be inspired by hisgod, smokes a pipe of tobacco fiercely till he works himself into a frenzy; the loud excitedtones in which he then talks are recognised as the voice of the god speaking through him. InMadura, an island off the north coast of Java, each spirit has its regular medium, who isoftener a woman than a man. To prepare herself for the reception of the spirit she inhales thefumes of incense, sitting with her head over a smoking censer. Gradually she falls into a sortof trance accompanied by shrieks, grimaces, and violent spasms. The spirit is now supposedto have entered into her, and when she grows calmer her words are regarded as oracular,being the utterances of the indwelling spirit, while her own soul is temporarily absent.The person temporarily inspired is believed to acquire, not merely divine knowledge, but also,at least occasionally, divine power. In Cambodia, when an epidemic breaks out, the inhabi-tants of several villages unite and go with a band of music at their head to look for the manwhom the local god is supposed to have chosen for his temporary incarnation. When found,Page 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"the man is conducted to the altar of the god, where the mystery of incarnation takes place.Then the man becomes an object of veneration to his fellows, who implore him to protect thevillage against the plague. A certain image of Apollo, which stood in a sacred cave at Hylaenear Magnesia, was thought to impart superhuman strength. Sacred men, inspired by it,leaped down precipices, tore up huge trees by the roots, and carried them on their backsalong the narrowest defiles. The feats performed by inspired dervishes belong to the sameclass.Thus far we have seen that the savage, failing to discern the limits of his ability to controlnature, ascribes to himself and to all men certain powers which we should now call supernat-ural. Further, we have seen that, over and above this general supernaturalism, some personsare supposed to be inspired for short periods by a divine spirit, and thus temporarily to enjoythe knowledge and power of the indwelling deity. From beliefs like these it is an easy step tothe conviction that certain men are permanently possessed by a deity, or in some other unde-fined way are endued with so high a degree of supernatural power as to be ranked as godsand to receive the homage of prayer and sacrifice. Sometimes these human gods are restrict-ed to purely supernatural or spiritual functions. Sometimes they exercise supreme politicalpower in addition. In the latter case they are kings as well as gods, and the government is atheocracy. Thus in the Marquesas or Washington Islands there was a class of men who weredeified in their lifetime. They were supposed to wield a supernatural power over the elements:they could give abundant harvests or smite the ground with barrenness; and they could inflictdisease or death. Human sacrifices were offered to them to avert their wrath. There were notmany of them, at the most one or two in each island. They lived in mystic seclusion. Theirpowers were sometimes, but not always, hereditary. A missionary has described one of thesehuman gods from personal observation. The god was a very old man who lived in a largehouse within an enclosure. In the house was a kind of altar, and on the beams of the houseand on the trees round it were hung human skeletons, head down. No one entered the enclo-sure except the persons dedicated to the service of the god; only on days when human vic-tims were sacrificed might ordinary people penetrate into the precinct. This human godreceived more sacrifices than all the other gods; often he would sit on a sort of scaffold infront of his house and call for two or three human victims at a time. They were alwaysbrought, for the terror he inspired was extreme. He was invoked all over the island, and offer-ings were sent to him from every side. Again, of the South Sea Islands in general we are toldthat each island had a man who represented or personified the divinity. Such men were calledgods, and their substance was confounded with that of the deity. The man-god was some-times the king himself; oftener he was a priest or subordinate chief.The ancient Egyptians, far from restricting their adoration to cats and dogs and such smalldeer, very liberally extended it to men. One of these human deities resided at the village ofAnabis, and burnt sacrifices were offered to him on the altars; after which, says Porphyry, hewould eat his dinner just as if he were an ordinary mortal. In classical antiquity the Sicilianphilosopher Empedocles gave himself out to be not merely a wizard but a god. Addressinghis fellow-citizens in verse he said: “O friends, in this great city that climbs the yellow slope Of Agrigentum’s citadel, who make good works your scope, Who offer to the stranger a haven quiet and fair, All hail! Among you honoured I walk with lofty air. With garlands, blooming garlands you crown my noble brow, Amortal man no longer, a deathless godhead now. Page 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Where e’er I go, the people crowd round and worship pay, And thousands follow seeking to learn the better way. Some crave prophetic visions, some smit with anguish sore Would fain hear words of comfort and suffer pain no more.” He asserted that he could teach his disciples how to make the wind to blow or be still, therain to fall and the sun to shine, how to banish sickness and old age and to raise the dead.When Demetrius Poliorcetes restored the Athenian democracy in 307 B.C., the Atheniansdecreed divine honours to him and his father Antigonus, both of them being then alive, underthe title of the Saviour Gods. Altars were set up to the Saviours, and a priest appointed toattend to their worship. The people went forth to meet their deliverer with hymns and dances,with garlands and incense and libations; they lined the streets and sang that he was the onlytrue god, for the other gods slept, or dwelt far away, or were not. In the words of a contempo-rary poet, which were chanted in public and sung in private: “Of all the gods the greatest and the dearest To the city are come. For Demeter and Demetrius Together time has brought. She comes to hold the Maiden’s awful rites, And he joyous and fair and laughing, As befits a god. Aglorious sight, with all his friends about him, He in their midst, They like to stars, and he the sun. Son of Poseidon the mighty, Aphrodite’s son, All hail! The other gods dwell far away, Or have no ears, Or are not, or pay us no heed. But thee we present see, No god of wood or stone, but godhead true. Therefore to thee we pray.”The ancient Germans believed that there was something holy in women, and accordinglyconsulted them as oracles. Their sacred women, we are told, looked on the eddying riversand listened to the murmur or the roar of the water, and from the sight and sound foretoldwhat would come to pass. But often the veneration of the men went further, and they wor-shipped women as true and living goddesses. For example, in the reign of Vespasian a cer-tain Veleda, of the tribe of the Bructeri, was commonly held to be a deity, and in that charac-ter reigned over her people, her sway being acknowledged far and wide. She lived in a toweron the river Lippe, a tributary of the Rhine. When the people of Cologne sent to make a treatywith her, the ambassadors were not admitted to her presence; the negotiations were conduct-ed through a minister, who acted as the mouthpiece of her divinity and reported her oracularutterances. The example shows how easily among our rude forefathers the ideas of divinityand royalty coalesced. It is said that among the Getae down to the beginning of our era therewas always a man who personified a god and was called God by the people. He dwelt on asacred mountain and acted as adviser to the king.According to the early Portuguese historian, Dos Santos, the Zimbas, or Muzimbas, a peoplePage 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"of South-eastern Africa, “do not adore idols or recognize any god, but instead they venerateand honour their king, whom they regard as a divinity, and they say he is the greatest andbest in the world. And the said king says of himself that he alone is god of the earth, for whichreason if it rains when he does not wish it to do so, or is too hot, he shoots arrows at the skyfor not obeying him.” The Mashona of Southern Africa informed their bishop that they hadonce had a god, but that the Matabeles had driven him away. “This last was in reference to acurious custom in some villages of keeping a man they called their god. He seemed to beconsulted by the people and had presents given to him. There was one at a village belongingto a chief Magondi, in the old days. We were asked not to fire off any guns near the village, orwe should frighten him away.” This Mashona god was formerly bound to render an annualtribute to the king of the Matabele in the shape of four black oxen and one dance. A mission-ary has seen and described the deity discharging the latter part of his duty in front of the royalhut. For three mortal hours, without a break, to the banging of a tambourine, the click of cas-tanettes, and the drone of a monotonous song, the swarthy god engaged in a frenzied dance,crouching on his hams like a tailor, sweating like a pig, and bounding about with an agilitywhich testified to the strength and elasticity of his divine legs.The Baganda of Central Africa believed in a god of Lake Nyanza, who sometimes took up hisabode in a man or woman. The incarnate god was much feared by all the people, includingthe king and the chiefs. When the mystery of incarnation had taken place, the man, or ratherthe god, removed about a mile and a half from the margin of the lake, and there awaited theappearance of the new moon before he engaged in his sacred duties. From the moment thatthe crescent moon appeared faintly in the sky, the king and all his subjects were at the com-mand of the divine man, or Lubare (god), as he was called, who reigned supreme not only inmatters of faith and ritual, but also in questions of war and state policy. He was consulted asan oracle; by his word he could inflict or heal sickness, withhold rain, and cause famine.Large presents were made him when his advice was sought. The chief of Urua, a large regionto the west of Lake Tanganyika, “arrogates to himself divine honours and power and pretendsto abstain from food for days without feeling its necessity; and, indeed, declares that as a godhe is altogether above requiring food and only eats, drinks, and smokes for the pleasure itaffords him.” Among the Gallas, when a woman grows tired of the cares of housekeeping,she begins to talk incoherently and to demean herself extravagantly. This is a sign of thedescent of the holy spirit Callo upon her. Immediately her husband prostrates himself andadores her; she ceases to bear the humble title of wife and is called “Lord”; domestic dutieshave no further claim on her, and her will is a divine law.The king of Loango is honoured by his people “as though he were a god; and he is calledSambee and Pango, which mean god. They believe that he can let them have rain when helikes; and once a year, in December, which is the time they want rain, the people come to begof him to grant it to them.” On this occasion the king, standing on his throne, shoots an arrowinto the air, which is supposed to bring on rain. Much the same is said of the king ofMombasa. Down to a few years ago, when his spiritual reign on earth was brought to anabrupt end by the carnal weapons of English marines and bluejackets, the king of Benin wasthe chief object of worship in his dominions. “He occupies a higher post here than the Popedoes in Catholic Europe; for he is not only God’s vicegerent upon earth, but a god himself,whose subjects both obey and adore him as such, although I believe their adoration to ariserather from fear than love.” The king of Iddah told the English officers of the Niger Expedition,“God made me after his own image; I am all the same as God; and he appointed me a king.”Apeculiarly bloodthirsty monarch of Burma, by name Badonsachen, whose very countenancePage 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"reflected the inbred ferocity of his nature, and under whose reign more victims perished bythe executioner than by the common enemy, conceived the notion that he was somethingmore than mortal, and that this high distinction had been granted him as a reward for hisnumerous good works. Accordingly he laid aside the title of king and aimed at making himselfa god. With this view, and in imitation of Buddha, who, before being advanced to the rank of adivinity, had quitted his royal palace and seraglio and retired from the world, Badonsachenwithdrew from his palace to an immense pagoda, the largest in the empire, which he hadbeen engaged in constructing for many years. Here he held conferences with the mostlearned monks, in which he sought to persuade them that the five thousand years assignedfor the observance of the law of Buddha were now elapsed, and that he himself was the godwho was destined to appear after that period, and to abolish the old law by substituting hisown. But to his great mortification many of the monks undertook to demonstrate the contrary;and this disappointment, combined with his love of power and his impatience under therestraints of an ascetic life, quickly disabused him of his imaginary godhead, and drove himback to his palace and his harem. The king of Siam “is venerated equally with a divinity. Hissubjects ought not to look him in the face; they prostrate themselves before him when hepasses, and appear before him on their knees, their elbows resting on the ground.” There is aspecial language devoted to his sacred person and attributes, and it must be used by all whospeak to or of him. Even the natives have difficulty in mastering this peculiar vocabulary. Thehairs of the monarch’s head, the soles of his feet, the breath of his body, indeed every singledetail of his person, both outward and inward, have particular names. When he eats or drinks,sleeps or walks, a special word indicates that these acts are being performed by the sover-eign, and such words cannot possibly be applied to the acts of any other person whatever.There is no word in the Siamese language by which any creature of higher rank or greaterdignity than a monarch can be described; and the missionaries, when they speak of God, areforced to use the native word for king.But perhaps no country in the world has been so prolific of human gods as India; nowherehas the divine grace been poured out in a more liberal measure on all classes of society fromkings down to milkmen. Thus amongst the Todas, a pastoral people of the Neilgherry Hills ofSouthern India, the dairy is a sanctuary, and the milkman who attends to it has beendescribed as a god. On being asked whether the Todas salute the sun, one of these divinemilkmen replied, “Those poor fellows do so, but I,” tapping his chest, “I, a god! why should Isalute the sun?” Every one, even his own father, prostrates himself before the milkman, andno one would dare to refuse him anything. No human being, except another milkman, maytouch him; and he gives oracles to all who consult him, speaking with the voice of a god.Further, in India “every king is regarded as little short of a present god.” The Hindoo law-bookof Manu goes farther and says that “even an infant king must not be despised from an ideathat he is a mere mortal; for he is a great deity in human form.” There is said to have been asect in Orissa some years ago who worshipped the late Queen Victoria in her lifetime as theirchief divinity. And to this day in India all living persons remarkable for great strength or valouror for supposed miraculous powers run the risk of being worshipped as gods. Thus, a sect inthe Punjaub worshipped a deity whom they called Nikkal Sen. This Nikkal Sen was no otherthan the redoubted General Nicholson, and nothing that the general could do or say dampedthe ardour of his adorers. The more he punished them, the greater grew the religious awewith which they worshipped him. At Benares not many years ago a celebrated deity wasincarnate in the person of a Hindoo gentleman who rejoiced in the euphonious name ofSwami Bhaskaranandaji Saraswati, and looked uncommonly like the late Cardinal Manning,only more ingenuous. His eyes beamed with kindly human interest, and he took what isPage 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"described as an innocent pleasure in the divine honours paid him by his confiding worship-pers.At Chinchvad, a small town about ten miles from Poona in Western India, there lives a familyof whom one in each generation is believed by a large proportion of the Mahrattas to be anincarnation of the elephant-headed god Gunputty. That celebrated deity was first made fleshabout the year 1640 in the person of a Brahman of Poona, by name Mooraba Gosseyn, whosought to work out his salvation by abstinence, mortification, and prayer. His piety had itsreward. The god himself appeared to him in a vision of the night and promised that a portionof his, that is, of Gunputty’s holy spirit should abide with him and with his seed after him evento the seventh generation. The divine promise was fulfilled. Seven successive incarnations,transmitted from father to son, manifested the light of Gunputty to a dark world. The last ofthe direct line, a heavy-looking god with very weak eyes, died in the year 1810. But the causeof truth was too sacred, and the value of the church property too considerable, to allow theBrahmans to contemplate with equanimity the unspeakable loss that would be sustained by aworld which knew not Gunputty. Accordingly they sought and found a holy vessel in whom thedivine spirit of the master had revealed itself anew, and the revelation has been happily con-tinued in an unbroken succession of vessels from that time to this. But a mysterious law ofspiritual economy, whose operation in the history of religion we may deplore though we can-not alter, has decreed that the miracles wrought by the god-man in these degenerate dayscannot compare with those which were wrought by his predecessors in days gone by; and itis even reported that the only sign vouchsafed by him to the present generation of vipers isthe miracle of feeding the multitude whom he annually entertains to dinner at Chinchvad.AHindoo sect, which has many representatives in Bombay and Central India, holds that itsspiritual chiefs or Maharajas, as they are called, are representatives or even actual incarna-tions on earth of the god Krishna. And as Krishna looks down from heaven with most favouron such as minister to the wants of his successors and vicars on earth, a peculiar rite calledSelf-devotion has been instituted, whereby his faithful worshippers make over their bodies,their souls, and, what is perhaps still more important, their worldly substance to his adorableincarnations; and women are taught to believe that the highest bliss for themselves and theirfamilies is to be attained by yielding themselves to the embraces of those beings in whom thedivine nature mysteriously coexists with the form and even the appetites of true humanity.Christianity itself has not uniformly escaped the taint of these unhappy delusions; indeed ithas often been sullied by the extravagances of vain pretenders to a divinity equal to or evensurpassing that of its great Founder. In the second century Montanus the Phrygian claimed tobe the incarnate Trinity, uniting in his single person God the Father, God the Son, and Godthe Holy Ghost. Nor is this an isolated case, the exorbitant pretension of a single ill-balancedmind. From the earliest times down to the present day many sects have believed that Christ,nay God himself, is incarnate in every fully initiated Christian, and they have carried this beliefto its logical conclusion by adoring each other. Tertullian records that this was done by his fel-low-Christians at Carthage in the second century; the disciples of St. Columba worshippedhim as an embodiment of Christ; and in the eighth century Elipandus of Toledo spoke ofChrist as “a god among gods,” meaning that all believers were gods just as truly as Jesushimself. The adoration of each other was customary among the Albigenses, and is noticedhundreds of times in the records of the Inquisition at Toulouse in the early part of the four-teenth century.In the thirteenth century there arose a sect called the Brethren and Sisters of the Free Spirit,Page 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"who held that by long and assiduous contemplation any man might be united to the deity inan ineffable manner and become one with the source and parent of all things, and that hewho had thus ascended to God and been absorbed in his beatific essence, actually formedpart of the Godhead, was the Son of God in the same sense and manner with Christ himself,and enjoyed thereby a glorious immunity from the trammels of all laws human and divine.Inwardly transported by this blissful persuasion, though outwardly presenting in their aspectand manners a shocking air of lunacy and distraction, the sectaries roamed from place toplace, attired in the most fantastic apparel and begging their bread with wild shouts and clam-our, spurning indignantly every kind of honest labour and industry as an obstacle to divinecontemplation and to the ascent of the soul towards the Father of spirits. In all their excur-sions they were followed by women with whom they lived on terms of the closest familiarity.Those of them who conceived they had made the greatest proficiency in the higher spirituallife dispensed with the use of clothes altogether in their assemblies, looking upon decencyand modesty as marks of inward corruption, characteristics of a soul that still grovelled underthe dominion of the flesh and had not yet been elevated into communion with the divine spirit,its centre and source. Sometimes their progress towards this mystic communion was acceler-ated by the Inquisition, and they expired in the flames, not merely with unclouded serenity,but with the most triumphant feelings of cheerfulness and joy.About the year 1830 there appeared, in one of the States of the American Union bordering onKentucky, an impostor who declared that he was the Son of God, the Saviour of mankind,and that he had reappeared on earth to recall the impious, the unbelieving, and sinners totheir duty. He protested that if they did not mend their ways within a certain time, he wouldgive the signal, and in a moment the world would crumble to ruins. These extravagant preten-sions were received with favour even by persons of wealth and position in society. At last aGerman humbly besought the new Messiah to announce the dreadful catastrophe to his fel-low-countrymen in the German language, as they did not understand English, and it seemeda pity that they should be damned merely on that account. The would-be Saviour in reply con-fessed with great candour that he did not know German. “What!” retorted the German, “youthe Son of God, and don’t speak all languages, and don’t even know German? Come, come,you are a knave, a hypocrite, and a madman. Bedlam is the place for you.” The spectatorslaughed, and went away ashamed of their credulity.Sometimes, at the death of the human incarnation, the divine spirit transmigrates into anotherman. The Buddhist Tartars believe in a great number of living Buddhas, who officiate asGrand Lamas at the head of the most important monasteries. When one of these GrandLamas dies his disciples do not sorrow, for they know that he will soon reappear, being bornin the form of an infant. Their only anxiety is to discover the place of his birth. If at this timethey see a rainbow they take it as a sign sent them by the departed Lama to guide them tohis cradle. Sometimes the divine infant himself reveals his identity. “I am the Grand Lama,” hesays, “the living Buddha of such and such a temple. Take me to my old monastery. I am itsimmortal head.” In whatever way the birthplace of the Buddha is revealed, whether by theBuddha’s own avowal or by the sign in the sky, tents are struck, and the joyful pilgrims, oftenheaded by the king or one of the most illustrious of the royal family, set forth to find and bringhome the infant god. Generally he is born in Tibet, the holy land, and to reach him the cara-van has often to traverse the most frightful deserts. When at last they find the child they falldown and worship him. Before, however, he is acknowledged as the Grand Lama whom theyseek he must satisfy them of his identity. He is asked the name of the monastery of which heclaims to be the head, how far off it is, and how many monks live in it; he must also describethe habits of the deceased Grand Lama and the manner of his death. Then various articles,Page 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"as prayer-books, tea-pots, and cups, are placed before him, and he has to point out thoseused by himself in his previous life. If he does so without a mistake his claims are admitted,and he is conducted in triumph to the monastery. At the head of all the Lamas is the DalaiLama of Lhasa, the Rome of Tibet. He is regarded as a living god, and at death his divineand immortal spirit is born again in a child. According to some accounts the mode of discover-ing the Dalai Lama is similar to the method, already described, of discovering an ordinaryGrand Lama. Other accounts speak of an election by drawing lots from a golden jar.Wherever he is born, the trees and plants put forth green leaves; at his bidding flowers bloomand springs of water rise; and his presence diffuses heavenly blessings.But he is by no means the only man who poses as a god in these regions. A register of all theincarnate gods in the Chinese empire is kept in the Li fan yiian or Colonial Office at Peking.The number of gods who have thus taken out a license is one hundred and sixty. Tibet isblessed with thirty of them, Northern Mongolia rejoices in nineteen, and Southern Mongoliabasks in the sunshine of no less than fifty-seven. The Chinese government, with a paternalsolicitude for the welfare of its subjects, forbids the gods on the register to be reborn any-where but in Tibet. They fear lest the birth of a god in Mongolia should have serious politicalconsequences by stirring the dormant patriotism and warlike spirit of the Mongols, who mightrally round an ambitious native deity of royal lineage and seek to win for him, at the point ofthe sword, a temporal as well as a spiritual kingdom. But besides these public or licensedgods there are a great many little private gods, or unlicensed practitioners of divinity, whowork miracles and bless their people in holes and corners; and of late years the Chinese gov-ernment has winked at the rebirth of these pettifogging deities outside of Tibet. However,once they are born, the government keeps its eye on them as well as on the regular practi-tioners, and if any of them misbehaves he is promptly degraded, banished to a distantmonastery, and strictly forbidden ever to be born again in the flesh.From our survey of the religious position occupied by the king in rude societies we may inferthat the claim to divine and supernatural powers put forward by the monarchs of great histori-cal empires like those of Egypt, Mexico, and Peru, was not the simple outcome of inflatedvanity or the empty expression of a grovelling adulation; it was merely a survival and exten-sion of the old savage apotheosis of living kings. Thus, for example, as children of the Sunthe Incas of Peru were revered like gods; they could do no wrong, and no one dreamed ofoffending against the person, honour, or property of the monarch or of any of the royal race.Hence, too, the Incas did not, like most people, look on sickness as an evil. They consideredit a messenger sent from their father the Sun to call them to come and rest with him in heav-en. Therefore the usual words in which an Inca announced his approaching end were these:“My father calls me to come and rest with him.” They would not oppose their father’s will byoffering sacrifice for recovery, but openly declared that he had called them to his rest. Issuingfrom the sultry valleys upon the lofty tableland of the Colombian Andes, the Spanish con-querors were astonished to find, in contrast to the savage hordes they had left in the swelter-ing jungles below, a people enjoying a fair degree of civilisation, practising agriculture, and liv-ing under a government which Humboldt has compared to the theocracies of Tibet andJapan. These were the Chibchas, Muyscas, or Mozcas, divided into two kingdoms, with capi-tals at Bogota and Tunja, but united apparently in spiritual allegiance to the high pontiff ofSogamozo or Iraca. By a long and ascetic novitiate, this ghostly ruler was reputed to haveacquired such sanctity that the waters and the rain obeyed him, and the weather dependedon his will. The Mexican kings at their accession, as we have seen, took an oath that theywould make the sun to shine, the clouds to give rain, the rivers to flow, and the earth to bringforth fruits in abundance. We are told that Montezuma, the last king of Mexico, was wor-Page 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"shipped by his people as a god.The early Babylonian kings, from the time of Sargon I. till the fourth dynasty of Ur or later,claimed to be gods in their lifetime. The monarchs of the fourth dynasty of Ur in particular hadtemples built in their honour; they set up their statues in various sanctuaries and commandedthe people to sacrifice to them; the eighth month was especially dedicated to the kings, andsacrifices were offered to them at the new moon and on the fifteenth of each month. Again,the Parthian monarchs of the Arsacid house styled themselves brothers of the sun and moonand were worshipped as deities. It was esteemed sacrilege to strike even a private memberof the Arsacid family in a brawl.The kings of Egypt were deified in their lifetime, sacrifices were offered to them, and theirworship was celebrated in special temples and by special priests. Indeed the worship of thekings sometimes cast that of the gods into the shade. Thus in the reign of Merenra a high offi-cial declared that he had built many holy places in order that the spirits of the king, the ever-living Merenra, might be invoked “more than all the gods.” “It has never been doubted that theking claimed actual divinity; he was the ‘great god,’ the ‘golden Horus,’ and son of Ra. Heclaimed authority not only over Egypt, but over ‘all lands and nations,’ ‘the whole world in itslength and its breadth, the east and the west,’ ‘the entire compass of the great circuit of thesun,’ ‘the sky and what is in it, the earth and all that is upon it,’ ‘every creature that walksupon two or upon four legs, all that fly or flutter, the whole world offers her productions tohim.’ Whatever in fact might be asserted of the Sun-god, was dogmatically predicable of theking of Egypt. His titles were directly derived from those of the Sun-god.” “In the course of hisexistence,” we are told, “the king of Egypt exhausted all the possible conceptions of divinitywhich the Egyptians had framed for themselves. A superhuman god by his birth and by hisroyal office, he became the deified man after his death. Thus all that was known of the divinewas summed up in him.”We have now completed our sketch, for it is no more than a sketch, of the evolution of thatsacred kingship which attained its highest form, its most absolute expression, in the monar-chies of Peru and Egypt. Historically, the institution appears to have originated in the order ofpublic magicians or medicine-men; logically it rests on a mistaken deduction from the associ-ation of ideas. Men mistook the order of their ideas for the order of nature, and hence imag-ined that the control which they have, or seem to have, over their thoughts, permitted them toexercise a corresponding control over things. The men who for one reason or another,because of the strength or the weakness of their natural parts, were supposed to possessthese magical powers in the highest degree, were gradually marked off from their fellows andbecame a separate class, who were destined to exercise a most far-reaching influence on thepolitical, religious, and intellectual evolution of mankind. Social progress, as we know, con-sists mainly in a successive differentiation of functions, or, in simpler language, a division oflabour. The work which in primitive society is done by all alike and by all equally ill, or nearlyso, is gradually distributed among different classes of workers and executed more and moreperfectly; and so far as the products, material or immaterial, of this specialised labour areshared by all, the whole community benefits by the increasing specialisation. Now magiciansor medicine-men appear to constitute the oldest artificial or professional class in the evolutionof society. For sorcerers are found in every savage tribe known to us; and among the lowestsavages, such as the Australian aborigines, they are the only professional class that exists.As time goes on, and the process of differentiation continues, the order of medicine-men isitself subdivided into such classes as the healers of disease, the makers of rain, and so forth;while the most powerful member of the order wins for himself a position as chief and gradual-Page 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"ly develops into a sacred king, his old magical functions falling more and more into the back-ground and being exchanged for priestly or even divine duties, in proportion as magic is slow-ly ousted by religion. Still later, a partition is effected between the civil and the religiousaspect of the kingship, the temporal power being committed to one man and the spiritual toanother. Meanwhile the magicians, who may be repressed but cannot be extirpated by thepredominance of religion, still addict themselves to their old occult arts in preference to thenewer ritual of sacrifice and prayer; and in time the more sagacious of their number perceivethe fallacy of magic and hit upon a more effectual mode of manipulating the forces of naturefor the good of man; in short, they abandon sorcery for science. I am far from affirming thatthe course of development has everywhere rigidly followed these lines: it has doubtless var-ied greatly in different societies. I merely mean to indicate in the broadest outline what I con-ceive to have been its general trend. Regarded from the industrial point of view the evolutionhas been from uniformity to diversity of function: regarded from the political point of view, ithas been from democracy to despotism. With the later history of monarchy, especially withthe decay of despotism and its displacement by forms of government better adapted to thehigher needs of humanity, we are not concerned in this enquiry: our theme is the growth, notthe decay, of a great and, in its time, beneficent institution.Chapter VIIIDepartmental Kings of NatureTHE preceding investigation has proved that the same union of sacred functions with a royaltitle which meets us in the King of the Wood at Nemi, the Sacrificial King at Rome, and themagistrate called the King at Athens, occurs frequently outside the limits of classical antiquityand is a common feature of societies at all stages from barbarism to civilisation. Further, itappears that the royal priest is often a king, not only in name but in fact, swaying the sceptreas well as the crosier. All this confirms the traditional view of the origin of the titular andpriestly kings in the republics of ancient Greece and Italy. At least by showing that the combi-nation of spiritual and temporal power, of which Graeco-Italian tradition preserved the memo-ry, has actually existed in many places, we have obviated any suspicion of improbability thatmight have attached to the tradition. Therefore we may now fairly ask, May not the King ofthe Wood have had an origin like that which a probable tradition assigns to the SacrificialKing of Rome and the titular King of Athens? In other words, may not his predecessors inoffice have been a line of kings whom a republican revolution stripped of their political power,leaving them only their religious functions and the shadow of a crown? There are at least tworeasons for answering this question in the negative. One reason is drawn from the abode ofthe priest of Nemi; the other from his title, the King of the Wood. If his predecessors had beenkings in the ordinary sense, he would surely have been found residing, like the fallen kings ofRome and Athens, in the city of which the sceptre had passed from him. This city must havebeen Aricia, for there was none nearer. But Aricia was three miles off from his forest sanctu-ary by the lake shore. If he reigned, it was not in the city, but in the greenwood. Again his title,King of the Wood, hardly allows us to suppose that he had ever been a king in the commonsense of the word. More likely he was a king of nature, and of a special side of nature, name-ly, the woods from which he took his title. If we could find instances of what we may calldepartmental kings of nature, that is of persons supposed to rule over particular elements oraspects of nature, they would probably present a closer analogy to the King of the Wood thanthe divine kings we have been hitherto considering, whose control of nature is general ratherthan special. Instances of such departmental kings are not wanting.On a hill at Bomma near the mouth of the Congo dwells Namvulu Vumu, King of the Rain andPage 88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Storm. Of some of the tribes on the Upper Nile we are told that they have no kings in thecommon sense; the only persons whom they acknowledge as such are the Kings of the Rain,Mata Kodou, who are credited with the power of giving rain at the proper time, that is, therainy season. Before the rains begin to fall at the end of March the country is a parched andarid desert; and the cattle, which form the people’s chief wealth, perish for lack of grass. So,when the end of March draws on, each householder betakes himself to the King of the Rainand offers him a cow that he may make the blessed waters of heaven to drip on the brownand withered pastures. If no shower falls, the people assemble and demand that the kingshall give them rain; and if the sky still continues cloudless, they rip up his belly, in which heis believed to keep the storms. Amongst the Bari tribe one of these Rain Kings made rain bysprinkling water on the ground out of a handbell.Among tribes on the outskirts of Abyssinia a similar office exists and has been thus describedby an observer: “The priesthood of the Alfai, as he is called by the Barea and Kunama, is aremarkable one; he is believed to be able to make rain. This office formerly existed amongthe Algeds and appears to be still common to the Nuba negroes. The Alfai of the Barea, whois also consulted by the northern Kunama, lives near Tembadere on a mountain alone withhis family. The people bring him tribute in the form of clothes and fruits, and cultivate for hima large field of his own. He is a kind of king, and his office passes by inheritance to his broth-er or sister’s son. He is supposed to conjure down rain and to drive away the locusts. But ifhe disappoints the people’s expectation and a great drought arises in the land, the Alfai isstoned to death, and his nearest relations are obliged to cast the first stone at him. When wepassed through the country, the office of Alfai was still held by an old man; but I heard thatrain-making had proved too dangerous for him and that he had renounced his office.”In the backwoods of Cambodia live two mysterious sovereigns known as the King of the Fireand the King of the Water. Their fame is spread all over the south of the great Indo-Chinesepeninsula; but only a faint echo of it has reached the West. Down to a few years ago noEuropean, so far as is known, had ever seen either of them; and their very existence mighthave passed for a fable, were it not that till lately communications were regularly maintainedbetween them and the King of Cambodia, who year by year exchanged presents with them.Their royal functions are of a purely mystic or spiritual order; they have no political authority;they are simple peasants, living by the sweat of their brow and the offerings of the faithful.According to one account they live in absolute solitude, never meeting each other and neverseeing a human face. They inhabit successively seven towers perched upon seven moun-tains, and every year they pass from one tower to another. People come furtively and castwithin their reach what is needful for their subsistence. The kingship lasts seven years, thetime necessary to inhabit all the towers successively; but many die before their time is out.The offices are hereditary in one or (according to others) two royal families, who enjoy highconsideration, have revenues assigned to them, and are exempt from the necessity of tillingthe ground. But naturally the dignity is not coveted, and when a vacancy occurs, all eligiblemen (they must be strong and have children) flee and hide themselves. Another account,admitting the reluctance of the hereditary candidates to accept the crown, does not counte-nance the report of their hermit-like seclusion in the seven towers. For it represents the peo-ple as prostrating themselves before the mystic kings whenever they appear in public, it beingthought that a terrible hurricane would burst over the country if this mark of homage wereomitted. Like many other sacred kings, of whom we shall read in the sequel, the Kings of Fireand Water are not allowed to die a natural death, for that would lower their reputation.Accordingly when one of them is seriously ill, the elders hold a consultation and if they thinkhe cannot recover they stab him to death. His body is burned and the ashes are piously col-Page 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"lected and publicly honoured for five years. Part of them is given to the widow, and she keepsthem in an urn, which she must carry on her back when she goes to weep on her husband’sgrave.We are told that the Fire King, the more important of the two, whose supernatural powershave never been questioned, officiates at marriages, festivals, and sacrifices in honour of theYan or spirit. On these occasions a special place is set apart for him; and the path by whichhe approaches is spread with white cotton cloths. A reason for confining the royal dignity tothe same family is that this family is in possession of certain famous talismans which wouldlose their virtue or disappear if they passed out of the family. These talismans are three: thefruit of a creeper called Cui, gathered ages ago at the time of the last deluge, but still freshand green; a rattan, also very old but bearing flowers that never fade; and lastly, a sword con-taining a Yan or spirit, who guards it constantly and works miracles with it. The spirit is said tobe that of a slave, whose blood chanced to fall upon the blade while it was being forged, andwho died a voluntary death to expiate his involuntary offence. By means of the two former tal-ismans the Water King can raise a flood that would drown the whole earth. If the Fire Kingdraws the magic sword a few inches from its sheath, the sun is hidden and men and beastsfall into a profound sleep; were he to draw it quite out of the scabbard, the world would cometo an end. To this wondrous brand sacrifices of buffaloes, pigs, fowls, and ducks are offeredfor rain. It is kept swathed in cotton and silk; and amongst the annual presents sent by theKing of Cambodia were rich stuffs to wrap the sacred sword.Contrary to the common usage of the country, which is to bury the dead, the bodies of boththese mystic monarchs are burnt, but their nails and some of their teeth and bones are reli-giously preserved as amulets. It is while the corpse is being consumed on the pyre that thekinsmen of the deceased magician flee to the forest and hide themselves, for fear of beingelevated to the invidious dignity which he has just vacated. The people go and search forthem, and the first whose lurking place they discover is made King of Fire or Water.These, then, are examples of what I have called departmental kings of nature. But it is a farcry to Italy from the forests of Cambodia and the sources of the Nile. And though Kings ofRain, Water, and Fire have been found, we have still to discover a King of the Wood to matchthe Arician priest who bore that title. Perhaps we shall find him nearer home.Chapter IXThe Worship of Trees1. TREE-SPIRITSIN the religious history of the Aryan race in Europe the worship of trees has played an impor-tant part. Nothing could be more natural. For at the dawn of history Europe was covered withimmense primaeval forests, in which the scattered clearings must have appeared like islets inan ocean of green. Down to the first century before our era the Hercynian forest stretchedeastward from the Rhine for a distance at once vast and unknown; Germans whom Caesarquestioned had travelled for two months through it without reaching the end. Four centurieslater it was visited by the Emperor Julian, and the solitude, the gloom, the silence of the forestappear to have made a deep impression on his sensitive nature. He declared that he knewnothing like it in the Roman empire. In our own country the wealds of Kent, Surrey, andSussex are remnants of the great forest of Anderida, which once clothed the whole of thesouth-eastern portion of the island. Westward it seems to have stretched till it joined anotherPage 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"forest that extended from Hampshire to Devon. In the reign of Henry II. the citizens of Londonstill hunted the wild bull and the boar in the woods of Hampstead. Even under the laterPlantagenets the royal forests were sixty-eight in number. In the forest of Arden it was saidthat down to modern times a squirrel might leap from tree to tree for nearly the whole lengthof Warwickshire. The excavation of ancient pile-villages in the valley of the Po has shown thatlong before the rise and probably the foundation of Rome the north of Italy was covered withdense woods of elms, chestnuts, and especially of oaks. Archaeology is here confirmed byhistory; for classical writers contain many references to Italian forests which have now disap-peared. As late as the fourth century before our era Rome was divided from central Etruria bythe dreaded Ciminian forest, which Livy compares to the woods of Germany. No merchant, ifwe may trust the Roman historian, had ever penetrated its pathless solitudes; and it wasdeemed a most daring feat when a Roman general, after sending two scouts to explore itsintricacies, led his army into the forest and, making his way to a ridge of the wooded moun-tains, looked down on the rich Etrurian fields spread out below. In Greece beautiful woods ofpine, oak, and other trees still linger on the slopes of the high Arcadian mountains, still adornwith their verdure the deep gorge through which the Ladon hurries to join the sacred Alpheus,and were still, down to a few years ago, mirrored in the dark blue waters of the lonely lake ofPheneus; but they are mere fragments of the forests which clothed great tracts in antiquity,and which at a more remote epoch may have spanned the Greek peninsula from sea to sea.From an examination of the Teutonic words for “temple” Grimm has made it probable thatamongst the Germans the oldest sanctuaries were natural woods. However that may be, tree-worship is well attested for all the great European families of the Aryan stock. Amongst theCelts the oak-worship of the Druids is familiar to every one, and their old word for sanctuaryseems to be identical in origin and meaning with the Latin nemus, a grove or woodland glade,which still survives in the name of Nemi. Sacred groves were common among the ancientGermans, and tree-worship is hardly extinct amongst their descendants at the present day.How serious that worship was in former times may be gathered from the ferocious penaltyappointed by the old German laws for such as dared to peel the bark of a standing tree. Theculprit’s navel was to be cut out and nailed to the part of the tree which he had peeled, andhe was to be driven round and round the tree till all his guts were wound about its trunk. Theintention of the punishment clearly was to replace the dead bark by a living substitute takenfrom the culprit; it was a life for a life, the life of a man for the life of a tree. At Upsala, the oldreligious capital of Sweden, there was a sacred grove in which every tree was regarded asdivine. The heathen Slavs worshipped trees and groves. The Lithuanians were not convertedto Christianity till towards the close of the fourteenth century, and amongst them at the date oftheir conversion the worship of trees was prominent. Some of them revered remarkable oaksand other great shady trees, from which they received oracular responses. Some maintainedholy groves about their villages or houses, where even to break a twig would have been asin. They thought that he who cut a bough in such a grove either died suddenly or was crip-pled in one of his limbs. Proofs of the prevalence of tree-worship in ancient Greece and Italyare abundant. In the sanctuary of Aesculapius at Cos, for example, it was forbidden to cutdown the cypress-trees under a penalty of a thousand drachms. But nowhere, perhaps, in theancient world was this antique form of religion better preserved than in the heart of the greatmetropolis itself. In the Forum, the busy centre of Roman life, the sacred fig-tree of Romuluswas worshipped down to the days of the empire, and the withering of its trunk was enough tospread consternation through the city. Again, on the slope of the Palatine Hill grew a cornel-tree which was esteemed one of the most sacred objects in Rome. Whenever the treeappeared to a passer-by to be drooping, he set up a hue and cry which was echoed by thepeople in the street, and soon a crowd might be seen running helter-skelter from all sidesPage 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"with buckets of water, as if (says Plutarch) they were hastening to put out a fire.Among the tribes of the Finnish-Ugrian stock in Europe the heathen worship was performedfor the most part in sacred groves, which were always enclosed with a fence. Such a groveoften consisted merely of a glade or clearing with a few trees dotted about, upon which in for-mer times the skins of the sacrificial victims were hung. The central point of the grove, atleast among the tribes of the Volga, was the sacred tree, beside which everything else sankinto insignificance. Before it the worshippers assembled and the priest offered his prayers, atits roots the victim was sacrificed, and its boughs sometimes served as a pulpit. No woodmight be hewn and no branch broken in the grove, and women were generally forbidden toenter it.But it is necessary to examine in some detail the notions on which the worship of trees andplants is based. To the savage the world in general is animate, and trees and plants are noexception to the rule. He thinks that they have souls like his own, and he treats them accord-ingly. “They say,” writes the ancient vegetarian Porphyry, “that primitive men led an unhappylife, for their superstition did not stop at animals but extended even to plants. For why shouldthe slaughter of an ox or a sheep be a greater wrong than the felling of a fir or an oak, seeingthat a soul is implanted in these trees also?” Similarly, the Hidatsa Indians of North Americabelieve that every natural object has its spirit, or to speak more properly, its shade. To theseshades some consideration or respect is due, but not equally to all. For example, the shadeof the cottonwood, the greatest tree in the valley of the Upper Missouri, is supposed to pos-sess an intelligence which, if properly approached, may help the Indians in certain undertak-ings; but the shades of shrubs and grasses are of little account. When the Missouri, swollenby a freshet in spring, carries away part of its banks and sweeps some tall tree into its cur-rent, it is said that the spirit of the tree cries, while the roots still cling to the land and until thetrunk falls with a splash into the stream. Formerly the Indians considered it wrong to fell oneof these giants, and when large logs were needed they made use only of trees which had fall-en of themselves. Till lately some of the more credulous old men declared that many of themisfortunes of their people were caused by this modern disregard for the rights of the livingcottonwood. The Iroquois believed that each species of tree, shrub, plant, and herb had itsown spirit, and to these spirits it was their custom to return thanks. The Wanika of EasternAfrica fancy that every tree, and especially every coco-nut tree, has its spirit; “the destructionof a cocoa-nut tree is regarded as equivalent to matricide, because that tree gives them lifeand nourishment, as a mother does her child.” Siamese monks, believing that there are soulseverywhere, and that to destroy anything whatever is forcibly to dispossess a soul, will notbreak a branch of a tree, “as they will not break the arm of an innocent person.” Thesemonks, of course, are Buddhists. But Buddhist animism is not a philosophical theory. It is sim-ply a common savage dogma incorporated in the system of an historical religion. To suppose,with Benfey and others, that the theories of animism and transmigration current among rudepeoples of Asia are derived from Buddhism, is to reverse the facts.Sometimes it is only particular sorts of trees that are supposed to be tenanted by spirits. AtGrbalj in Dalmatia it is said that among great beeches, oaks, and other trees there are somethat are endowed with shades or souls, and whoever fells one of them must die on the spot,or at least live an invalid for the rest of his days. If a woodman fears that a tree which he hasfelled is one of this sort, he must cut off the head of a live hen on the stump of the tree withthe very same axe with which he cut down the tree. This will protect him from all harm, evenif the tree be one of the animated kind. The silk-cotton trees, which rear their enormoustrunks to a stupendous height, far out-topping all the other trees of the forest, are regardedPage 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"with reverence throughout West Africa, from the Senegal to the Niger, and are believed to bethe abode of a god or spirit. Among the Ewespeaking peoples of the Slave Coast theindwelling god of this giant of the forest goes by the name of Huntin. Trees in which he spe-cially dwells—for it is not every silk-cotton tree that he thus honours—are surrounded by agirdle of palm-leaves; and sacrifices of fowls, and occasionally of human beings, are fastenedto the trunk or laid against the foot of the tree. A tree distinguished by a girdle of palm-leavesmay not be cut down or injured in any way; and even silk-cotton trees which are not sup-posed to be animated by Huntin may not be felled unless the woodman first offers a sacrificeof fowls and palm-oil to purge himself of the proposed sacrilege. To omit the sacrifice is anoffence which may be punished with death. Among the Kangra mountains of the Punjaub agirl used to be annually sacrificed to an old cedar-tree, the families of the village taking it inturn to supply the victim. The tree was cut down not very many years ago.If trees are animate, they are necessarily sensitive and the cutting of them down becomes adelicate surgical operation, which must be performed with as tender a regard as possible forthe feelings of the sufferers, who otherwise may turn and rend the careless or bungling oper-ator. When an oak is being felled “it gives a kind of shriekes or groanes, that may be heard amile off, as if it were the genius of the oake lamenting. E. Wyld, Esq., hath heard it severalltimes.” The Ojebways “very seldom cut down green or living trees, from the idea that it putsthem to pain, and some of their medicine-men profess to have heard the wailing of the treesunder the axe.” Trees that bleed and utter cries of pain or indignation when they are hackedor burned occur very often in Chinese books, even in Standard Histories. Old peasants insome parts of Austria still believe that forest-trees are animate, and will not allow an incisionto be made in the bark without special cause; they have heard from their fathers that the treefeels the cut not less than a wounded man his hurt. In felling a tree they beg its pardon. It issaid that in the Upper Palatinate also old woodmen still secretly ask a fine, sound tree to for-give them before they cut it down. So in Jarkino the woodman craves pardon of the tree hefells. Before the Ilocanes of Luzon cut down trees in the virgin forest or on the mountains,they recite some verses to the following effect: “Be not uneasy, my friend, though we fell whatwe have been ordered to fell.” This they do in order not to draw down on themselves thehatred of the spirits who live in the trees, and who are apt to avenge themselves by visitingwith grievous sickness such as injure them wantonly. The Basoga of Central Africa think that,when a tree is cut down, the angry spirit which inhabits it may cause the death of the chiefand his family. To prevent this disaster they consult a medicine-man before they fell a tree. Ifthe man of skill gives leave to proceed, the woodman first offers a fowl and a goat to the tree;then as soon as he has given the first blow with the axe, he applies his mouth to the cut andsucks some of the sap. In this way he forms a brotherhood with the tree, just as two menbecome blood-brothers by sucking each other’s blood. After that he can cut down his tree-brother with impunity.But the spirits of vegetation are not always treated with deference and respect. If fair wordsand kind treatment do not move them, stronger measures are sometimes resorted to. Thedurian-tree of the East Indies, whose smooth stem often shoots up to a height of eighty orninety feet without sending out a branch, bears a fruit of the most delicious flavour and themost disgusting stench. The Malays cultivate the tree for the sake of its fruit, and have beenknown to resort to a peculiar ceremony for the purpose of stimulating its fertility. Near Jugra inSelangor there is a small grove of durian-trees, and on a specially chosen day the villagersused to assemble in it. Thereupon one of the local sorcerers would take a hatchet and deliverseveral shrewd blows on the trunk of the most barren of the trees, saying, “Will you now bearfruit or not? If you do not, I shall fell you.” To this the tree replied through the mouth of anoth-Page 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"er man who had climbed a mangostin-tree hard by (the durian-tree being unclimbable), “Yes, Iwill now bear fruit; I beg of you not to fell me.” So in Japan to make trees bear fruit two mengo into an orchard. One of them climbs up a tree and the other stands at the foot with an axe.The man with the axe asks the tree whether it will yield a good crop next year and threatensto cut it down if it does not. To this the man among the branches replies on behalf of the treethat it will bear abundantly. Odd as this mode of horticulture may seem to us, it has its exactparallels in Europe. On Christmas Eve many a South Slavonian and Bulgarian peasantswings an axe threateningly against a barren fruit-tree, while another man standing by inter-cedes for the menaced tree, saying, “Do not cut it down; it will soon bear fruit.” Thrice the axeis swung, and thrice the impending blow is arrested at the entreaty of the intercessor. Afterthat the frightened tree will certainly bear fruit next year.The conception of trees and plants as animated beings naturally results in treating them asmale and female, who can be married to each other in a real, and not merely a figurative orpoetical, sense of the word. The notion is not purely fanciful, for plants like animals have theirsexes and reproduce their kind by the union of the male and female elements. But whereas inall the higher animals the organs of the two sexes are regularly separated between differentindividuals, in most plants they exist together in every individual of the species. This rule,however, is by no means universal, and in many species the male plant is distinct from thefemale. The distinction appears to have been observed by some savages, for we are told thatthe Maoris “are acquainted with the sex of trees, etc., and have distinct names for the maleand female of some trees.” The ancients knew the difference between the male and thefemale date-palm, and fertilised them artificially by shaking the pollen of the male tree overthe flowers of the female. The fertilisation took place in spring. Among the heathen of Harranthe month during which the palms were fertilised bore the name of the Date Month, and atthis time they celebrated the marriage festival of all the gods and goddesses. Different fromthis true and fruitful marriage of the palm are the false and barren marriages of plants whichplay a part in Hindoo superstition. For example, if a Hindoo has planted a grove of mangos,neither he nor his wife may taste of the fruit until he has formally married one of the trees, asa bridegroom, to a tree of a different sort, commonly a tamarind-tree, which grows near it inthe grove. If there is no tamarind to act as bride, a jasmine will serve the turn. The expensesof such a marriage are often considerable, for the more Brahmans are feasted at it, thegreater the glory of the owner of the grove. A family has been known to sell its golden and sil-ver trinkets, and to borrow all the money they could in order to marry a mango-tree to a jas-mine with due pomp and ceremony. On Christmas Eve German peasants used to tie fruit-trees together with straw ropes to make them bear fruit, saying that the trees were thus mar-ried.In the Moluccas, when the clove-trees are in blossom, they are treated like pregnant women.No noise may be made near them; no light or fire may be carried past them at night; no onemay approach them with his hat on, all must uncover in their presence. These precautionsare observed lest the tree should be alarmed and bear no fruit, or should drop its fruit toosoon, like the untimely delivery of a woman who has been frightened in her pregnancy. So inthe East the growing rice-crop is often treated with the same considerate regard as a breed-ing woman. Thus in Amboyna, when the rice is in bloom, the people say that it is pregnantand fire no guns and make no other noises near the field, for fear lest, if the rice were thusdisturbed, it would miscarry, and the crop would be all straw and no grain.Sometimes it is the souls of the dead which are believed to animate trees. The Dieri tribe ofCentral Australia regard as very sacred certain trees which are supposed to be their fathersPage 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"transformed; hence they speak with reverence of these trees, and are careful that they shallnot be cut down or burned. If the settlers require them to hew down the trees, they earnestlyprotest against it, asserting that were they to do so they would have no luck, and might bepunished for not protecting their ancestors. Some of the Philippine Islanders believe that thesouls of their ancestors are in certain trees, which they therefore spare. If they are obliged tofell one of these trees, they excuse themselves to it by saying that it was the priest who madethem do it. The spirits take up their abode, by preference, in tall and stately trees with greatspreading branches. When the wind rustles the leaves, the natives fancy it is the voice of thespirit; and they never pass near one of these trees without bowing respectfully, and askingpardon of the spirit for disturbing his repose. Among the Ignorrotes, every village has itssacred tree, in which the souls of the dead forefathers of the hamlet reside. Offerings aremade to the tree, and any injury done to it is believed to entail some misfortune on the vil-lage. Were the tree cut down, the village and all its inhabitants would inevitably perish.In Corea the souls of people who die of the plague or by the roadside, and of women whoexpire in childbirth, invariably take up their abode in trees. To such spirits offerings of cake,wine, and pork are made on heaps of stones piled under the trees. In China it has been cus-tomary from time immemorial to plant trees on graves in order thereby to strengthen the soulof the deceased and thus to save his body from corruption; and as the evergreen cypressand pine are deemed to be fuller of vitality than other trees, they have been chosen by prefer-ence for this purpose. Hence the trees that grow on graves are sometimes identified with thesouls of the departed. Among the Miao-Kia, an aboriginal race of Southern and WesternChina, a sacred tree stands at the entrance of every village, and the inhabitants believe that itis tenanted by the soul of their first ancestor and that it rules their destiny. Sometimes there isa sacred grove near a village, where the trees are suffered to rot and die on the spot. Theirfallen branches cumber the ground, and no one may remove them unless he has first askedleave of the spirit of the tree and offered him a sacrifice. Among the Maraves of SouthernAfrica the burial-ground is always regarded as a holy place where neither a tree may be fellednor a beast killed, because everything there is supposed to be tenanted by the souls of thedead.In most, if not all, of these cases the spirit is viewed as incorporate in the tree; it animates thetree and must suffer and die with it. But, according to another and probably later opinion, thetree is not the body, but merely the abode of the tree-spirit, which can quit it and return to it atpleasure. The inhabitants of Siaoo, an East Indian island, believe in certain sylvan spirits whodwell in forests or in great solitary trees. At full moon the spirit comes forth from his lurking-place and roams about. He has a big head, very long arms and legs, and a ponderous body.In order to propitiate the wood-spirits people bring offerings of food, fowls, goats, and so forthto the places which they are supposed to haunt. The people of Nias think that, when a treedies, its liberated spirit becomes a demon, which can kill a coco-nut palm by merely lightingon its branches, and can cause the death of all the children in a house by perching on one ofthe posts that support it. Further, they are of opinion that certain trees are at all times inhabit-ed by roving demons who, if the trees were damaged, would be set free to go about onerrands of mischief. Hence the people respect these trees, and are careful not to cut themdown.Not a few ceremonies observed at cutting down haunted trees are based on the belief thatthe spirits have it in their power to quit the trees at pleasure or in case of need. Thus whenthe Pelew Islanders are felling a tree, they conjure the spirit of the tree to leave it and settleon another. The wily negro of the Slave Coast, who wishes to fell an ashorin tree, but knowsPage 95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"that he cannot do it so long as the spirit remains in the tree, places a little palm-oil on theground as a bait, and then, when the unsuspecting spirit has quitted the tree to partake of thisdainty, hastens to cut down its late abode. When the Toboongkoos of Celebes are about toclear a piece of forest in order to plant rice, they build a tiny house and furnish it with tinyclothes and some food and gold. Then they call together all the spirits of the wood, offer themthe little house with its contents, and beseech them to quit the spot. After that they may safelycut down the wood without fearing to wound themselves in so doing. Before the Tomori,another tribe of Celebes, fell a tall tree they lay a quid of betel at its foot, and invite the spiritwho dwells in the tree to change his lodging; moreover, they set a little ladder against thetrunk to enable him to descend with safety and comfort. The Mandelings of Sumatra endeav-our to lay the blame of all such misdeeds at the door of the Dutch authorities. Thus when aman is cutting a road through a forest and has to fell a tall tree which blocks the way, he willnot begin to ply his axe until he has said: “Spirit who lodgest in this tree, take it not ill that Icut down thy dwelling, for it is done at no wish of mine but by order of the Controller.” Andwhen he wishes to clear a piece of forest-land for cultivation, it is necessary that he shouldcome to a satisfactory understanding with the woodland spirits who live there before he layslow their leafy dwellings. For this purpose he goes to the middle of the plot of ground, stoopsdown, and pretends to pick up a letter. Then unfolding a bit of paper he reads aloud an imagi-nary letter from the Dutch Government, in which he is strictly enjoined to set about clearingthe land without delay. Having done so, he says: “You hear that, spirits. I must begin clearingat once, or I shall be hanged.”Even when a tree has been felled, sawn into planks, and used to build a house, it is possiblethat the woodland spirit may still be lurking in the timber, and accordingly some people seekto propitiate him before or after they occupy the new house. Hence, when a new dwelling isready the Toradjas of Celebes kill a goat, a pig, or a buffalo, and smear all the woodwork withits blood. If the building is a lobo or spirit-house, a fowl or a dog is killed on the ridge of theroof, and its blood allowed to flow down on both sides. The ruder Tonapoo in such a casesacrifice a human being on the roof. This sacrifice on the roof of a lobo or temple serves thesame purpose as the smearing of blood on the woodwork of an ordinary house. The intentionis to propitiate the forest-spirits who may still be in the timber; they are thus put in goodhumour and will do the inmates of the house no harm. For a like reason people in Celebesand the Moluccas are much afraid of planting a post upside down at the building of a house;for the forest-spirit, who might still be in the timber, would very naturally resent the indignityand visit the inmates with sickness. The Kayans of Borneo are of opinion that tree-spiritsstand very stiffly on the point of honour and visit men with their displeasure for any injurydone to them. Hence after building a house, whereby they have been forced to ill-treat manytrees, these people observe a period of penance for a year during which they must abstainfrom many things, such as the killing of bears, tiger-cats, and serpents.2. BENEFICIENT POWERS OF TREE-SPIRITSWhen a tree comes to be viewed, no longer as the body of the tree-spirit, but simply as itsabode which it can quit at pleasure, an important advance has been made in religiousthought. Animism is passing into polytheism. In other words, instead of regarding each tree asa living and conscious being, man now sees in it merely a lifeless, inert mass, tenanted for alonger or shorter time by a supernatural being who, as he can pass freely from tree to tree,thereby enjoys a certain right of possession or lordship over the trees, and, ceasing to be atree-soul, becomes a forest god. As soon as the tree-spirit is thus in a measure disengagedfrom each particular tree, he begins to change his shape and assume the body of a man, inPage 96"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"virtue of a general tendency of early thought to clothe all abstract spiritual beings in concretehuman form. Hence in classical art the sylvan deities are depicted in human shape, theirwoodland character being denoted by a branch or some equally obvious symbol. But thischange of shape does not affect the essential character of the tree-spirit. The powers whichhe exercised as a tree-soul incorporate in a tree, he still continues to wield as a god of trees.This I shall now attempt to prove in detail. I shall show, first, that trees considered as animatebeings are credited with the power of making the rain to fall, the sun to shine, flocks andherds to multiply, and women to bring forth easily; and, second, that the very same powersare attributed to tree-gods conceived as anthropomorphic beings or as actually incarnate inliving men.First, then, trees or tree-spirits are believed to give rain and sunshine. When the missionaryJerome of Prague was persuading the heathen Lithuanians to fell their sacred groves, a mul-titude of women besought the Prince of Lithuania to stop him, saying that with the woods hewas destroying the house of god from which they had been wont to get rain and sunshine.The Mundaris in Assam think that if a tree in the sacred grove is felled the sylvan gods evincetheir displeasure by withholding rain. In order to procure rain the inhabitants of Monyo, a vil-lage in the Sagaing district of Upper Burma, chose the largest tamarind-tree near the villageand named it the haunt of the spirit (nat) who controls the rain. Then they offered bread,coco-nuts, plantains, and fowls to the guardian spirit of the village and to the spirit who givesrain, and they prayed, “O Lord nat have pity on us poor mortals, and stay not the rain.Inasmuch as our offering is given ungrudgingly, let the rain fall day and night.” Afterwards liba-tions were made in honour of the spirit of the tamarind-tree; and still later three elderlywomen, dressed in fine clothes and wearing necklaces and earrings, sang the Rain Song.Again, tree-spirits make the crops to grow. Amongst the Mundaris every village has its sacredgrove, and “the grove deities are held responsible for the crops, and are especially honouredat all the great agricultural festivals.” The negroes of the Gold Coast are in the habit of sacri-ficing at the foot of certain tall trees, and they think that if one of these were felled all thefruits of the earth would perish. The Gallas dance in couples round sacred trees, praying for agood harvest. Every couple consists of a man and woman, who are linked together by a stick,of which each holds one end. Under their arms they carry green corn or grass. Swedishpeasants stick a leafy branch in each furrow of their corn-fields, believing that this will ensurean abundant crop. The same idea comes out in the German and French custom of theHarvest-May. This is a large branch or a whole tree, which is decked with ears of corn,brought home on the last waggon from the harvest-field, and fastened on the roof of the farm-house or of the barn, where it remains for a year. Mannhardt has proved that this branch ortree embodies the tree-spirit conceived as the spirit of vegetation in general, whose vivifyingand fructifying influence is thus brought to bear upon the corn in particular. Hence in Swabiathe Harvest-May is fastened amongst the last stalks of corn left standing on the field; in otherplaces it is planted on the corn-field and the last sheaf cut is attached to its trunk.Again, the tree-spirit makes the herds to multiply and blesses women with offspring. InNorthern India the Emblica officinalis is a sacred tree. On the eleventh of the month Phalgun(February) libations are poured at the foot of the tree, a red or yellow string is bound aboutthe trunk, and prayers are offered to it for the fruitfulness of women, animals, and crops.Again, in Northern India the coco-nut is esteemed one of the most sacred fruits, and is calledSriphala, or the fruit of Sri, the goddess of prosperity. It is the symbol of fertility, and allthrough Upper India is kept in shrines and presented by the priests to women who desire tobecome mothers. In the town of Qua, near Old Calabar, there used to grow a palm-tree whichPage 97"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"ensured conception to any barren woman who ate a nut from its branches. In Europe theMay-tree or May-pole is apparently supposed to possess similar powers over both womenand cattle. Thus in some parts of Germany on the first of May the peasants set up May-treesor May-bushes at the doors of stables and byres, one for each horse and cow; this is thoughtto make the cows yield much milk. Of the Irish we are told that “they fancy a green bough ofa tree, fastened on May-day against the house, will produce plenty of milk that summer.”On the second of July some of the Wends used to set up an oak-tree in the middle of the vil-lage with an iron cock fastened to its top; then they danced round it, and drove the cattleround it to make them thrive. The Circassians regard the pear-tree as the protector of cattle.So they cut down a young pear-tree in the forest, branch it, and carry it home, where it isadored as a divinity. Almost every house has one such pear-tree. In autumn, on the day ofthe festival, the tree is carried into the house with great ceremony to the sound of music andamid the joyous cries of all the inmates, who compliment it on its fortunate arrival. It is cov-ered with candles, and a cheese is fastened to its top. Round about it they eat, drink, andsing. Then they bid the tree good-bye and take it back to the courtyard, where it remains forthe rest of the year, set up against the wall, without receiving any mark of respect.In the Tuhoe tribe of Maoris “the power of making women fruitful is ascribed to trees. Thesetrees are associated with the navel-strings of definite mythical ancestors, as indeed the navel-strings of all children used to be hung upon them down to quite recent times. A barren womanhad to embrace such a tree with her arms, and she received a male or a female child accord-ing as she embraced the east or the west side.” The common European custom of placing agreen bush on May Day before or on the house of a beloved maiden probably originated inthe belief of the fertilising power of the tree-spirit. In some parts of Bavaria such bushes areset up also at the houses of newly-married pairs, and the practice is only omitted if the wife isnear her confinement; for in that case they say that the husband has “set up a May-bush forhimself.” Among the South Slavonians a barren woman, who desires to have a child, places anew chemise upon a fruitful tree on the eve of St. George’s Day. Next morning before sunriseshe examines the garment, and if she finds that some living creature has crept on it, shehopes that her wish will be fulfilled within the year. Then she puts on the chemise, confidentthat she will be as fruitful as the tree on which the garment has passed the night. Among theKara-Kirghiz barren women roll themselves on the ground under a solitary apple-tree, in orderto obtain offspring. Lastly, the power of granting to women an easy delivery at child-birth isascribed to trees both in Sweden and Africa. In some districts of Sweden there was formerlya bardträd or guardian-tree (lime, ash, or elm) in the neighbourhood of every farm. No onewould pluck a single leaf of the sacred tree, any injury to which was punished by ill-luck orsickness. Pregnant women used to clasp the tree in their arms in order to ensure an easydelivery. In some negro tribes of the Congo region pregnant women make themselves gar-ments out of the bark of a certain sacred tree, because they believe that this tree deliversthem from the dangers that attend child-bearing. The story that Leto clasped a palm-tree andan olive-tree or two laurel-trees, when she was about to give birth to the divine twins Apolloand Artemis, perhaps points to a similar Greek belief in the efficacy of certain trees to facili-tate delivery.Chapter XRelics of Tree Worship in Modern EuropeFROM the foregoing review of the beneficent qualities commonly ascribed to tree-spirits, it iseasy to understand why customs like the May-tree or May-pole have prevailed so widely andPage 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"figured so prominently in the popular festivals of European peasants. In spring or early sum-mer or even on Midsummer Day, it was and still is in many parts of Europe the custom to goout to the woods, cut down a tree and bring it into the village, where it is set up amid generalrejoicings; or the people cut branches in the woods, and fasten them on every house. Theintention of these customs is to bring home to the village, and to each house, the blessingswhich the tree-spirit has in its power to bestow. Hence the custom in some places of plantinga May-tree before every house, or of carrying the village May-tree from door to door, thatevery household may receive its share of the blessing. Out of the mass of evidence on thissubject a few examples may be selected.Sir Henry Piers, in his Description of Westmeath, writing in 1682 says: “On May-eve, everyfamily sets up before their door a green bush, strewed over with yellow flowers, which themeadows yield plentifully. In countries where timber is plentiful, they erect tall slender trees,which stand high, and they continue almost the whole year; so as a stranger would go nigh toimagine that they were all signs of ale-sellers, and that all houses were ale-houses.” InNorthamptonshire a young tree ten or twelve feet high used to be planted before each houseon May Day so as to appear growing; flowers were thrown over it and strewn about the door.“Among ancient customs still retained by the Cornish, may be reckoned that of decking theirdoors and porches on the first of May with green boughs of sycamore and hawthorn, and ofplanting trees, or rather stumps of trees, before their houses.” In the north of England it wasformerly the custom for young people to rise a little after midnight on the morning of the firstof May, and go out with music and the blowing of horns into the woods, where they brokebranches and adorned them with nosegays and crowns of flowers. This done, they returnedabout sunrise and fastened the flower-decked branches over the doors and windows of theirhouses. At Abingdon in Berkshire young people formerly went about in groups on May morn-ing, singing a carol of which the following are two of the verses: “We’ve been rambling all the night, And sometime of this day; And now returning back again, We bring a garland gay. Agarland gay we bring you here; And at your door we stand; It is a sprout well budded out,The work of our Lord’s hand.”At the towns of Saffron Walden and Debden in Essex on the first of May little girls go about inparties from door to door singing a song almost identical with the above and carrying gar-lands; a doll dressed in white is usually placed in the middle of each garland. Similar customshave been and indeed are still observed in various parts of England. The garlands are gener-ally in the form of hoops intersecting each other at right angles. It appears that a hoopwreathed with rowan and marsh marigold, and bearing suspended within it two balls, is stillcarried on May Day by villagers in some parts of Ireland. The balls, which are sometimes cov-ered with gold and silver paper, are said to have originally represented the sun and moon.In some villages of the Vosges Mountains on the first Sunday of May young girls go in bandsfrom house to house, singing a song in praise of May, in which mention is made of the “breadand meal that come in May.” If money is given them, they fasten a green bough to the door; ifit is refused, they wish the family many children and no bread to feed them. In the Frenchdepartment of Mayenne, boys who bore the name of Maillotins used to go about from farm toPage 99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"farm on the first of May singing carols, for which they received money or a drink; they planteda small tree or a branch of a tree. Near Saverne in Alsace bands of people go about carryingMay-trees. Amongst them is a man dressed in a white shirt with his face blackened; in front ofhim is carried a large May-tree, but each member of the band also carries a smaller one. Oneof the company bears a huge basket, in which he collects eggs, bacon, and so forth.On the Thursday before Whitsunday the Russian villagers “go out into the woods, sing songs,weave garlands, and cut down a young birch-tree, which they dress up in woman’s clothes, oradorn with many-coloured shreds and ribbons. After that comes a feast, at the end of whichthey take the dressed-up birch-tree, carry it home to their village with joyful dance and song,and set it up in one of the houses, where it remains as an honoured guest till Whitsunday. Onthe two intervening days they pay visits to the house where their ‘guest’ is; but on the thirdday, Whitsunday, they take her to a stream and fling her into its waters,” throwing their gar-lands after her. In this Russian custom the dressing of the birch in woman’s clothes showshow clearly the tree is personified; and the throwing it into a stream is most probably a rain-charm.In some parts of Sweden on the eve of May Day lads go about carrying each a bunch offresh birch twigs wholly or partly in leaf. With the village fiddler at their head, they make theround of the houses singing May songs; the burden of their songs is a prayer for fine weather,a plentiful harvest, and worldly and spiritual blessings. One of them carries a basket in whichhe collects gifts of eggs and the like. If they are well received, they stick a leafy twig in theroof over the cottage door. But in Sweden midsummer is the season when these ceremoniesare chiefly observed. On the Eve of St. John (the twenty-third of June) the houses are thor-oughly cleansed and garnished with green boughs and flowers. Young fir-trees are raised atthe doorway and elsewhere about the homestead; and very often small umbrageous arboursare constructed in the garden. In Stockholm on this day a leaf-market is held at which thou-sands of May-poles (Maj Stanger), from six inches to twelve feet high, decorated with leaves,flowers, slips of coloured paper, gilt egg-shells strung on reeds, and so on, are exposed forsale. Bonfires are lit on the hills, and the people dance round them and jump over them. Butthe chief event of the day is setting up the May-pole. This consists of a straight and tallspruce-pine tree, stripped of its branches. “At times hoops and at others pieces of wood,placed crosswise, are attached to it at intervals; whilst at others it is provided with bows, rep-resenting, so to say, a man with his arms akimbo. From top to bottom not only the ‘Maj Stang’(May-pole) itself, but the hoops, bows, etc., are ornamented with leaves, flowers, slips of vari-ous cloth, gilt egg-shells, etc.; and on the top of it is a large vane, or it may be a flag.” Theraising of the May-pole, the decoration of which is done by the village maidens, is an affair ofmuch ceremony; the people flock to it from all quarters, and dance round it in a great ring.Midsummer customs of the same sort used to be observed in some parts of Germany. Thusin the towns of the Upper Harz Mountains tall fir-trees, with the bark peeled off their lowertrunks, were set up in open places and decked with flowers and eggs, which were paintedyellow and red. Round these trees the young folk danced by day and the old folk in theevening. In some parts of Bohemia also a May-pole or midsummer-tree is erected on St.John’s Eve. The lads fetch a tall fir or pine from the wood and set it up on a height, where thegirls deck it with nosegays, garlands, and red ribbons. It is afterwards burned.It would be needless to illustrate at length the custom, which has prevailed in various parts ofEurope, such as England, France, and Germany, of setting up a village May-tree or May-poleon May Day. A few examples will suffice. The puritanical writer Phillip Stubbes in his Anatomieof Abuses, first published at London in 1583, has described with manifest disgust how theyPage 100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"used to bring in the May-pole in the days of good Queen Bess. His description affords us avivid glimpse of merry England in the olden time. “Against May, Whitsonday, or other time, allthe yung men and maides, olde men and wives, run gadding over night to the woods, groves,hils, and mountains, where they spend all the night in plesant pastimes; and in the morningthey return, bringing with them birch and branches of trees, to deck their assemblies withall.And no mervaile, for there is a great Lord present amongst them, as superintendent and Lordover their pastimes and sportes, namely, Sathan, prince of hel. But the chiefest jewel theybring from thence is their May-pole, which they bring home with great veneration, as thus.They have twentie or fortie yoke of oxen, every oxe having a sweet nose-gay of flouersplaced on the tip of his hornes, and these oxen drawe home this May-pole (this stinkyng ydol,rather), which is covered all over with floures and hearbs, bound round about with strings,from the top to the bottome, and sometime painted with variable colours, with two or threehundred men, women and children following it with great devotion. And thus beeing rearedup, with handkercheefs and flags hovering on the top, they straw the ground rounde about,binde green boughes about it, set up sommer haules, bowers, and arbors hard by it. And thenfall they to daunce about it, like as the heathen people did at the dedication of the Idols,whereof this is a perfect pattern, or rather the thing itself. I have heard it credibly reported(and that viva voce) by men of great gravitie and reputation, that of fortie, threescore, or ahundred maides going to the wood over night, there have scaresly the third part of themreturned home againe undefiled.”In Swabia on the first of May a tall fir-tree used to be fetched into the village, where it wasdecked with ribbons and set up; then the people danced round it merrily to music. The treestood on the village green the whole year through, until a fresh tree was brought in next MayDay. In Saxony “people were not content with bringing the summer symbolically (as king orqueen) into the village; they brought the fresh green itself from the woods even into the hous-es: that is the May or Whitsuntide trees, which are mentioned in documents from the thir-teenth century onwards. The fetching in of the May-tree was also a festival. The people wentout into the woods to seek the May (majum quaerere), brought young trees, especially firsand birches, to the village and set them up before the doors of the houses or of the cattle-stalls or in the rooms. Young fellows erected such May-trees, as we have already said, beforethe chambers of their sweethearts. Besides these household Mays, a great May-tree or May-pole, which had also been brought in solemn procession to the village, was set up in the mid-dle of the village or in the market-place of the town. It had been chosen by the whole commu-nity, who watched over it most carefully. Generally the tree was stripped of its branches andleaves, nothing but the crown being left, on which were displayed, in addition to many-coloured ribbons and cloths, a variety of victuals such as sausages, cakes, and eggs. Theyoung folk exerted themselves to obtain these prizes. In the greasy poles which are still to beseen at our fairs we have a relic of these old May-poles. Not uncommonly there was a raceon foot or on horseback to the May-tree—a Whitsunday pastime which in course of time hasbeen divested of its goal and survives as a popular custom to this day in many parts ofGermany.” At Bordeaux on the first of May the boys of each street used to erect in it a May-pole, which they adorned with garlands and a great crown; and every evening during thewhole of the month the young people of both sexes danced singing about the pole. Down tothe present day May-trees decked with flowers and ribbons are set up on May Day in everyvillage and hamlet of gay Provence. Under them the young folk make merry and the old folkrest.In all these cases, apparently, the custom is or was to bring in a new May-tree each year.However, in England the village May-pole seems as a rule, at least in later times, to havePage 101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"been permanent, not renewed annually. Villages of Upper Bavaria renew their May-pole onceevery three, four, or five years. It is a fir-tree fetched from the forest, and amid all the wreaths,flags, and inscriptions with which it is bedecked, an essential part is the bunch of dark greenfoliage left at the top “as a memento that in it we have to do, not with a dead pole, but with aliving tree from the greenwood.” We can hardly doubt that originally the practice everywherewas to set up a new May-tree every year. As the object of the custom was to bring in the fruc-tifying spirit of vegetation, newly awakened in spring, the end would have been defeated if,instead of a living tree, green and sappy, an old withered one had been erected year afteryear or allowed to stand permanently. When, however, the meaning of the custom had beenforgotten, and the May-tree was regarded simply as a centre for holiday merry-making, peo-ple saw no reason for felling a fresh tree every year, and preferred to let the same tree standpermanently, only decking it with fresh flowers on May Day. But even when the May-pole hadthus become a fixture, the need of giving it the appearance of being a green tree, not a deadpole, was sometimes felt. Thus at Weverham in Cheshire “are two May-poles, which are dec-orated on this day (May Day) with all due attention to the ancient solemnity; the sides arehung with garlands, and the top terminated by a birch or other tall slender tree with its leaveson; the bark being peeled, and the stem spliced to the pole, so as to give the appearance ofone tree from the summit.” Thus the renewal of the May-tree is like the renewal of theHarvest-May; each is intended to secure a fresh portion of the fertilising spirit of vegetation,and to preserve it throughout the year. But whereas the efficacy of the Harvest-May is restrict-ed to promoting the growth of the crops, that of the May-tree or May-branch extends also, aswe have seen, to women and cattle. Lastly, it is worth noting that the old May-tree is some-times burned at the end of the year. Thus in the district of Prague young people break piecesof the public May-tree and place them behind the holy pictures in their rooms, where theyremain till next May Day, and are then burned on the hearth. In Würtemberg the busheswhich are set up on the houses on Palm Sunday are sometimes left there for a year and thenburnt.So much for the tree-spirit conceived as incorporate or immanent in the tree. We have now toshow that the tree-spirit is often conceived and represented as detached from the tree andclothed in human form, and even as embodied in living men or women. The evidence for thisanthropomorphic representation of the tree-spirit is largely to be found in the popular customsof European peasantry.There is an instructive class of cases in which the tree-spirit is represented simultaneously invegetable form and in human form, which are set side by side as if for the express purpose ofexplaining each other. In these cases the human representative of the tree-spirit is sometimesa doll or puppet, sometimes a living person, but whether a puppet or a person, it is placedbeside a tree or bough; so that together the person or puppet, and the tree or bough, form asort of bilingual inscription, the one being, so to speak, a translation of the other. Here, there-fore, there is no room left for doubt that the spirit of the tree is actually represented in humanform. Thus in Bohemia, on the fourth Sunday in Lent, young people throw a puppet calledDeath into the water; then the girls go into the wood, cut down a young tree, and fasten to it apuppet dressed in white clothes to look like a woman; with this tree and puppet they go fromhouse to house collecting gratuities and singing songs with the refrain: “We carry Death out of the village, We bring Summer into the village.” Here, as we shall see later on, the “Summer” is the spirit of vegetation returning or reviving inPage 102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"spring. In some parts of our own country children go about asking for pence with some smallimitations of May-poles, and with a finely-dressed doll which they call the Lady of the May. Inthese cases the tree and the puppet are obviously regarded as equivalent.At Thann, in Alsace, a girl called the Little May Rose, dressed in white, carries a small May-tree, which is gay with garlands and ribbons. Her companions collect gifts from door to door,singing a song: “Little May Rose turn round three times, Let us look at you round and round! Rose of the May, come to the greenwood away, We will be merry all. So we go from the May to the roses.” In the course of the song a wish is expressed that those who give nothing may lose theirfowls by the marten, that their vine may bear no clusters, their tree no nuts, their field nocorn; the produce of the year is supposed to depend on the gifts offered to these Maysingers. Here and in the cases mentioned above, where children go about with green boughsor garlands on May Day singing and collecting money, the meaning is that with the spirit ofvegetation they bring plenty and good luck to the house, and they expect to be paid for theservice. In Russian Lithuania, on the first of May, they used to set up a green tree before thevillage. Then the rustic swains chose the prettiest girl, crowned her, swathed her in birchbranches and set her beside the May-tree, where they danced, sang, and shouted “O May! OMay!” In Brie (Isle de France) a May-tree is erected in the midst of the village; its top iscrowned with flowers; lower down it is twined with leaves and twigs, still lower with hugegreen branches. The girls dance round it, and at the same time a lad wrapt in leaves andcalled Father May is led about. In the small towns of the Franken Wald mountains in NorthernBavaria, on the second of May, a Walber tree is erected before a tavern, and a man dancesround it, enveloped in straw from head to foot in such a way that the ears of corn unite abovehis head to form a crown. He is called the Walber, and used to be led in procession throughthe streets, which were adorned with sprigs of birch.Amongst the Slavs of Carinthia, on St. George’s Day (the twenty-third of April), the youngpeople deck with flowers and garlands a tree which has been felled on the eve of the festival.The tree is then carried in procession, accompanied with music and joyful acclamations, thechief figure in the procession being the Green George, a young fellow clad from head to footin green birch branches. At the close of the ceremonies the Green George, that is an effigy ofhim, is thrown into the water. It is the aim of the lad who acts Green George to step out of hisleafy envelope and substitute the effigy so adroitly that no one shall perceive the change. Inmany places, however, the lad himself who plays the part of Green George is ducked in ariver or pond, with the express intention of thus ensuring rain to make the fields and mead-ows green in summer. In some places the cattle are crowned and driven from their stalls tothe accompaniment of a song: “Green George we bring, Green George we accompany, May he feed our herds well. If not, to the water with him.” Here we see that the same powers of making rain and fostering the cattle, which are ascribedPage 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"to the tree-spirit regarded as incorporate in the tree, are also attributed to the tree-spirit repre-sented by a living man.Among the gypsies of Transylvania and Roumania the festival of Green George is the chiefcelebration of spring. Some of them keep it on Easter Monday, others on St. George’s Day(the twentythird of April). On the eve of the festival a young willow tree is cut down, adornedwith garlands and leaves, and set up in the ground. Women with child place one of their gar-ments under the tree, and leave it there over night; if next morning they find a leaf of the treelying on the garment, they know that their delivery will be easy. Sick and old people go to thetree in the evening, spit on it thrice, and say, “You will soon die, but let us live.” Next morningthe gypsies gather about the willow. The chief figure of the festival is Green George, a ladwho is concealed from top to toe in green leaves and blossoms. He throws a few handfuls ofgrass to the beasts of the tribe, in order that they may have no lack of fodder throughout theyear. Then he takes three iron nails, which have lain for three days and nights in water, andknocks them into the willow; after which he pulls them out and flings them into a runningstream to propitiate the water-spirits. Finally, a pretence is made of throwing Green Georgeinto the water, but in fact it is only a puppet made of branches and leaves which is ducked inthe stream. In this version of the custom the powers of granting an easy delivery to womenand of communicating vital energy to the sick and old are clearly ascribed to the willow; whileGreen George, the human double of the tree, bestows food on the cattle, and further ensuresthe favour of the water-spirits by putting them in indirect communication with the tree.Without citing more examples to the same effect, we may sum up the results of the precedingpages in the words of Mannhardt: “The customs quoted suffice to establish with certainty theconclusion that in these spring processions the spirit of vegetation is often represented bothby the May-tree and in addition by a man dressed in green leaves or flowers or by a girl simi-larly adorned. It is the same spirit which animates the tree and is active in the inferior plantsand which we have recognised in the May-tree and the Harvest-May. Quite consistently thespirit is also supposed to manifest his presence in the first flower of spring and reveals him-self both in a girl representing a May-rose, and also, as giver of harvest, in the person of theWalber. The procession with this representative of the divinity was supposed to produce thesame beneficial effects on the fowls, the fruit-trees, and the crops as the presence of the deityhimself. In other words the mummer was regarded not as an image but as an actual repre-sentative of the spirit of vegetation; hence the wish expressed by the attendants on the May-rose and the May-tree that those who refuse them gifts of eggs, bacon, and so forth, mayhave no share in the blessings which it is in the power of the itinerant spirit to bestow. Wemay conclude that these begging processions with May-trees or May-boughs from door todoor (‘bringing the May or the summer’) had everywhere originally a serious and, so to speak,sacramental significance; people really believed that the god of growth was present unseen inthe bough; by the procession he was brought to each house to bestow his blessing. Thenames May, Father May, May Lady, Queen of the May, by which the anthropomorphic spirit ofvegetation is often denoted, show that the idea of the spirit of vegetation is blent with a per-sonification of the season at which his powers are most strikingly manifested.”So far we have seen that the tree-spirit or the spirit of vegetation in general is representedeither in vegetable form alone, as by a tree, bough, or flower; or in vegetable and human formsimultaneously, as by a tree, bough, or flower in combination with a puppet or a living person.It remains to show that the representation of him by a tree, bough, or flower is sometimesentirely dropped, while the representation of him by a living person remains. In this case therepresentative character of the person is generally marked by dressing him or her in leaves orPage 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"flowers; sometimes, too, it is indicated by the name he or she bears.Thus in some parts of Russia on St. George’s Day (the twenty-third of April) a youth isdressed out, like our Jack-in-the-Green, with leaves and flowers. The Slovenes call him theGreen George. Holding a lighted torch in one hand and a pie in the other, he goes out to thecorn-fields, followed by girls singing appropriate songs. A circle of brushwood is next lighted,in the middle of which is set the pie. All who take part in the ceremony then sit down aroundthe fire and divide the pie among them. In this custom the Green George dressed in leavesand flowers is plainly identical with the similarly disguised Green George who is associatedwith a tree in the Carinthian, Transylvanian, and Roumanian customs observed on the sameday. Again, we saw that in Russia at Whitsuntide a birch-tree is dressed in woman’s clothesand set up in the house. Clearly equivalent to this is the custom observed on Whit-Monday byRussian girls in the district of Pinsk. They choose the prettiest of their number, envelop her ina mass of foliage taken from the birch-trees and maples, and carry her about through the vil-lage.In Ruhla as soon as the trees begin to grow green in spring, the children assemble on aSunday and go out into the woods, where they choose one of their playmates to be the LittleLeaf Man. They break branches from the trees and twine them about the child till only hisshoes peep out from the leafy mantle. Holes are made in it for him to see through, and two ofthe children lead the Little Leaf Man that he may not stumble or fall. Singing and dancing theytake him from house to house, asking for gifts of food such as eggs, cream, sausages, andcakes. Lastly, they sprinkle the Leaf Man with water and feast on the food they have collect-ed. In the Fricktal, Switzerland, at Whitsuntide boys go out into a wood and swathe one oftheir number in leafy boughs. He is called the Whitsuntide-lout, and being mounted on horse-back with a green branch in his hand he is led back into the village. At the village-well a haltis called and the leaf-clad lout is dismounted and ducked in the trough. Thereby he acquiresthe right of sprinkling water on everybody, and he exercises the right specially on girls andstreet urchins. The urchins march before him in bands begging him to give them aWhitsuntide wetting.In England the best-known example of these leaf-clad mummers is the Jack-in-the-Green, achimney-sweeper who walks encased in a pyramidal framework of wickerwork, which is cov-ered with holly and ivy, and surmounted by a crown of flowers and ribbons. Thus arrayed hedances on May Day at the head of a troop of chimney-sweeps, who collect pence. In Fricktala similar frame of basketwork is called the Whitsuntide Basket. As soon as the trees begin tobud, a spot is chosen in the wood, and here the village lads make the frame with all secrecy,lest others should forestall them. Leafy branches are twined round two hoops, one of whichrests on the shoulders of the wearer, the other encircles his claves; holes are made for hiseyes and mouth; and a large nosegay crowns the whole. In this guise he appears suddenly inthe village at the hour of vespers, preceded by three boys blowing on horns made of willowbark. The great object of his supporters is to set up the Whitsuntide Basket on the villagewell, and to keep it and him there, despite the efforts of the lads from neighbouring villages,who seek to carry off the Whitsuntide Basket and set it up on their own well.In the class of cases of which the foregoing are specimens it is obvious that the leaf-clad per-son who is led about is equivalent to the May-tree, May-bough, or May-doll, which is carriedfrom house to house by children begging. Both are representatives of the beneficent spirit ofvegetation, whose visit to the house is recompensed by a present of money or food.Page 105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Often the leaf-clad person who represents the spirit of vegetation is known as the king or thequeen; thus, for example, he or she is called the May King, Whitsuntide King, Queen of May,and so on. These titles, as Mannhardt observes, imply that the spirit incorporate in vegetationis a ruler, whose creative power extends far and wide.In a village near Salzwedel a May-tree is set up at Whitsuntide and the boys race to it; hewho reaches it first is king; a garland of flowers is put round his neck and in his hand he car-ries a May-bush, with which, as the procession moves along, he sweeps away the dew. Ateach house they sing a song, wishing the inmates good luck, referring to the “black cow inthe stall milking white milk, black hen on the nest laying white eggs,” and begging a gift ofeggs, bacon, and so on. At the village of Ellgoth in Silesia a ceremony called the King’s Raceis observed at Whitsuntide. A pole with a cloth tied to it is set up in a meadow, and the youngmen ride past it on horseback, each trying to snatch away the cloth as he gallops by. The onewho succeeds in carrying it off and dipping it in the neighbouring Oder is proclaimed King.Here the pole is clearly a substitute for a May-tree. In some villages of Brunswick atWhitsuntide a May King is completely enveloped in a May-bush. In some parts of Thüringenalso they have a May King at Whitsuntide, but he is dressed up rather differently. A frame ofwood is made in which a man can stand; it is completely covered with birch boughs and issurmounted by a crown of birch and flowers, in which a bell is fastened. This frame is placedin the wood and the May King gets into it. The rest go out and look for him, and when theyhave found him they lead him back into the village to the magistrate, the clergyman, and oth-ers, who have to guess who is in the verdurous frame. If they guess wrong, the May Kingrings his bell by shaking his head, and a forfeit of beer or the like must be paid by the unsuc-cessful guesser. At Wahrstedt the boys at Whitsuntide choose by lot a king and a high-stew-ard. The latter is completely concealed in a May-bush, wears a wooden crown wreathen withflowers, and carries a wooden sword. The king, on the other hand, is only distinguished by anosegay in his cap, and a reed, with a red ribbon tied to it, in his hand. They beg for eggsfrom house to house, threatening that, where none are given, none will be laid by the hensthroughout the year. In this custom the high-steward appears, for some reason, to haveusurped the insignia of the king. At Hildesheim five or six young fellows go about on the after-noon of Whit-Monday cracking long whips in measured time and collecting eggs from thehouses. The chief person of the band is the Leaf King, a lad swathed so completely inbirchen twigs that nothing of him can be seen but his feet. A huge head-dress of birchen twigsadds to his apparent stature. In his hand he carries a long crook, with which he tries to catchstray dogs and children. In some parts of Bohemia on Whit-Monday the young fellows dis-guise themselves in tall caps of birch bark adorned with flowers. One of them is dressed as aking and dragged on a sledge to the village green, and if on the way they pass a pool thesledge is always overturned into it. Arrived at the green they gather round the king; the crierjumps on a stone or climbs up a tree and recites lampoons about each house and itsinmates. Afterwards the disguises of bark are stripped off and they go about the village in hol-iday attire, carrying a May-tree and begging. Cakes, eggs, and corn are sometimes giventhem. At Grossvargula, near Langensalza, in the eighteenth century a Grass King used to beled about in procession at Whitsuntide. He was encased in a pyramid of poplar branches, thetop of which was adorned with a royal crown of branches and flowers. He rode on horsebackwith the leafy pyramid over him, so that its lower end touched the ground, and an openingwas left in it only for his face. Surrounded by a cavalcade of young fellows, he rode in proces-sion to the town hall, the parsonage, and so on, where they all got a drink of beer. Thenunder the seven lindens of the neighbouring Sommerberg, the Grass King was stripped of hisgreen casing; the crown was handed to the Mayor, and the branches were stuck in the flaxfields in order to make the flax grow tall. In this last trait the fertilising influence ascribed toPage 106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"the representative of the tree-spirit comes out clearly. In the neighbourhood of Pilsen(Bohemia) a conical hut of green branches, without any door, is erected at Whitsuntide in themidst of the village. To this hut rides a troop of village lads with a king at their head. He wearsa sword at his side and a sugar-loaf hat of rushes on his head. In his train are a judge, acrier, and a personage called the Frog-flayer or Hangman. This last is a sort of ragged mer-ryandrew, wearing a rusty old sword and bestriding a sorry hack. On reaching the hut thecrier dismounts and goes round it looking for a door. Finding none, he says, “Ah, this is per-haps an enchanted castle; the witches creep through the leaves and need no door.” At last hedraws his sword and hews his way into the hut, where there is a chair, on which he seatshimself and proceeds to criticise in rhyme the girls, farmers, and farm-servants of the neigh-bourhood. When this is over, the Frog-flayer steps forward and, after exhibiting a cage withfrogs in it, sets up a gallows on which he hangs the frogs in a row. In the neighbourhood ofPlas the ceremony differs in some points. The king and his soldiers are completely clad inbark, adorned with flowers and ribbons; they all carry swords and ride horses, which are gaywith green branches and flowers. While the village dames and girls are being criticised at thearbour, a frog is secretly pinched and poked by the crier till it quacks. Sentence of death ispassed on the frog by the king; the hangman beheads it and flings the bleeding body amongthe spectators. Lastly, the king is driven from the hut and pursued by the soldiers. The pinch-ing and beheading of the frog are doubtless, as Mannhardt observes, a rain-charm. We haveseen that some Indians of the Orinoco beat frogs for the express purpose of producing rain,and that killing a frog is a European rain-charm.Often the spirit of vegetation in spring is represented by a queen instead of a king. In theneighbourhood of Libchowic (Bohemia), on the fourth Sunday in Lent, girls dressed in whiteand wearing the first spring flowers, as violets and daisies, in their hair, lead about the villagea girl who is called the Queen and is crowned with flowers. During the procession, which isconducted with great solemnity, none of the girls may stand still, but must keep whirling roundcontinually and singing. In every house the Queen announces the arrival of spring and wishesthe inmates good luck and blessings, for which she receives presents. In German Hungarythe girls choose the prettiest girl to be their Whitsuntide Queen, fasten a towering wreath onher brow, and carry her singing through the streets. At every house they stop, sing old bal-lads, and receive presents. In the south-east of Ireland on May Day the prettiest girl used tobe chosen Queen of the district for twelve months. She was crowned with wild flowers; feast-ing, dancing, and rustic sports followed, and were closed by a grand procession in theevening. During her year of office she presided over rural gatherings of young people atdances and merry-makings. If she married before next May Day, her authority was at an end,but her successor was not elected till that day came round. The May Queen is common InFrance and familiar in England.Again the spirit of vegetation is sometimes represented by a king and queen, a lord and lady,or a bridegroom and bride. Here again the parallelism holds between the anthropomorphicand the vegetable representation of the tree-spirit, for we have seen above that trees aresometimes married to each other. At Halford in South Warwickshire the children go fromhouse to house on May Day, walking two and two in procession and headed by a King andQueen. Two boys carry a May-pole some six or seven feet high, which is covered with flowersand greenery. Fastened to it near the top are two cross-bars at right angles to each other.These are also decked with flowers, and from the ends of the bars hang hoops similarlyadorned. At the houses the children sing May songs and receive money, which is used to pro-vide tea for them at the schoolhouse in the afternoon. In a Bohemian village near Königgrätzon Whit-Monday the children play the king’s game, at which a king and queen march aboutPage 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"under a canopy, the queen wearing a garland, and the youngest girl carrying two wreaths ona plate behind them. They are attended by boys and girls called groomsmen and brides-maids, and they go from house to house collecting gifts. A regular feature in the popular cele-bration of Whitsuntide in Silesia used to be, and to some extent still is, the contest for thekingship. This contest took various forms, but the mark or goal was generally the May-tree orMay-pole. Sometimes the youth who succeeded in climbing the smooth pole and bringingdown the prize was proclaimed the Whitsuntide King and his sweetheart the WhitsuntideBride. Afterwards the king, carrying the May-bush, repaired with the rest of the company tothe alehouse, where a dance and a feast ended the merry-making. Often the young farmersand labourers raced on horseback to the May-pole, which was adorned with flowers, ribbons,and a crown. He who first reached the pole was the Whitsuntide King, and the rest had toobey his orders for that day. The worst rider became the clown. At the May-tree all dismount-ed and hoisted the king on their shoulders. He nimbly swarmed up the pole and broughtdown the May-bush and the crown, which had been fastened to the top. Meanwhile the clownhurried to the alehouse and proceeded to bolt thirty rolls of bread and to swig four quart bot-tles of brandy with the utmost possible despatch. He was followed by the king, who bore theMay-bush and crown at the head of the company. If on their arrival the clown had already dis-posed of the rolls and the brandy, and greeted the king with a speech and a glass of beer, hisscore was paid by the king; otherwise he had to settle it himself. After church time the statelyprocession wound through the village. At the head of it rode the king, decked with flowers andcarrying the May-bush. Next came the clown with his clothes turned inside out, a great flaxenbeard on his chain, and the Whitsuntide crown on his head. Two riders disguised as guardsfollowed. The procession drew up before every farmyard; the two guards dismounted, shutthe clown into the house, and claimed a contribution from the housewife to buy soap withwhich to wash the clown’s beard. Custom allowed them to carry off any victuals which werenot under lock and key. Last of all they came to the house in which the king’s sweetheartlived. She was greeted as Whitsuntide Queen and received suitable presents—to wit, amany-coloured sash, a cloth, and an apron. The king got as a prize, a vest, a neck-cloth, andso forth, and had the right of setting up the May-bush or Whitsuntide-tree before his master’syard, where it remained as an honourable token till the same day next year. Finally the pro-cession took its way to the tavern, where the king and queen opened the dance. Sometimesthe Whitsuntide King and Queen succeeded to office in a different way. A man of straw, aslarge as life and crowned with a red cap, was conveyed in a cart, between two men armedand disguised as guards, to a place where a mock court was waiting to try him. A great crowdfollowed the cart. After a formal trial the straw man was condemned to death and fastened toa stake on the execution ground. The young men with bandaged eyes tried to stab him with aspear. He who succeeded became king and his sweetheart queen. The straw man wasknown as the Goliath.In a parish of Denmark it used to be the custom at Whitsuntide to dress up a little girl as theWhitsun-bride and a little boy as her groom. She was decked in all the finery of a grown-upbride, and wore a crown of the freshest flowers of spring on her head. Her groom was as gayas flowers, ribbons, and knots could make him. The other children adorned themselves asbest they could with the yellow flowers of the trollius and caltha. Then they went in great statefrom farmhouse to farmhouse, two little girls walking at the head of the procession as brides-maids, and six or eight outriders galloping ahead on hobby-horses to announce their coming.Contributions of eggs, butter, loaves, cream, coffee, sugar, and tallow-candles were receivedand conveyed away in baskets. When they had made the round of the farms, some of thefarmers’ wives helped to arrange the wedding feast, and the children danced merrily in clogson the stamped clay floor till the sun rose and the birds began to sing. All this is now a thingPage 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"of the past. Only the old folks still remember the little Whitsun-bride and her mimic pomp.We have seen that in Sweden the ceremonies associated elsewhere with May Day orWhitsuntide commonly take place at Midsummer. Accordingly we find that in some parts ofthe Swedish province of Blekinge they still choose a Midsummer’s Bride, to whom the “churchcoronet” is occasionally lent. The girl selects for herself a Bridegroom, and a collection ismade for the pair, who for the time being are looked on as man and wife. The other youthsalso choose each his bride. A similar ceremony seems to be still kept up in Norway.In the neighbourhood of Briancon (Dauphiné) on May Day the lads wrap up in green leaves ayoung fellow whose sweetheart has deserted him or married another. He lies down on theground and feigns to be asleep. Then a girl who likes him, and would marry him, comes andwakes him, and raising him up offers him her arm and a flag. So they go to the alehouse,where the pair lead off the dancing. But they must marry within the year, or they are treatedas old bachelor and old maid, and are debarred the company of the young folks. The lad iscalled the Bridegroom of the month of May. In the alehouse he puts off his garment of leaves,out of which, mixed with flowers, his partner in the dance makes a nosegay, and wears it ather breast next day, when he leads her again to the alehouse. Like this is a Russian customobserved in the district of Nerechta on the Thursday before Whitsunday. The girls go out intoa birch-wood, wind a girdle or band round a stately birch, twist its lower branches into awreath, and kiss each other in pairs through the wreath. The girls who kiss through thewreath call each other gossips. Then one of the girls steps forward, and mimicking a drunkenman, flings herself on the ground, rolls on the grass, and feigns to fall fast asleep. Another girlwakens the pretended sleeper and kisses him; then the whole bevy trips singing through thewood to twine garlands, which they throw into the water. In the fate of the garlands floating onthe stream they read their own. Here the part of the sleeper was probably at one time playedby a lad. In these French and Russian customs we have a forsaken bridegroom, in the follow-ing a forsaken bride. On Shrove Tuesday the Slovenes of Oberkrain drag a straw puppet withjoyous cries up and down the village; then they throw it into the water or burn it, and from theheight of the flames they judge of the abundance of the next harvest. The noisy crew is fol-lowed by a female masker, who drags a great board by a string and gives out that she is aforsaken bride.Viewed in the light of what has gone before, the awakening of the forsaken sleeper in theseceremonies probably represents the revival of vegetation in spring. But it is not easy to assigntheir respective parts to the forsaken bridegroom and to the girl who wakes him from hisslumber. Is the sleeper the leafless forest or the bare earth of winter? Is the girl who awakenshim the fresh verdure or the genial sunshine of spring? It is hardly possible, on the evidencebefore us, to answer these questions.In the Highlands of Scotland the revival of vegetation in spring used to be graphically repre-sented on St. Bride’s Day, the first of February. Thus in the Hebrides “the mistress and ser-vants of each family take a sheaf of oats, and dress it up in women’s apparel, put it in a largebasket and lay a wooden club by it, and this they call Briid’s bed; and then the mistress andservants cry three times, ‘Briid is come, Briid is welcome.’ This they do just before going tobed, and when they rise in the morning they look among the ashes, expecting to see theimpression of Briid’s club there; which if they do, they reckon it a true presage of a good cropand prosperous year, and the contrary they take as an ill omen.” The same custom isdescribed by another witness thus: “Upon the night before Candlemas it is usual to make abed with corn and hay, over which some blankets are laid, in a part of the house, near thePage 109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"door. When it is ready, a person goes out and repeats three times,... ‘Bridget, Bridget, comein; thy bed is ready.’ One or more candles are left burning near it all night.” Similarly in theIsle of Man “on the eve of the first of February, a festival was formerly kept, called, in theManks language, Laa’l Breeshey, in honour of the Irish lady who went over to the Isle of Manto receive the veil from St. Maughold. The custom was to gather a bundle of green rushes,and standing with them in the hand on the threshold of the door, to invite the holy SaintBridget to come and lodge with them that night. In the Manks language, the invitation ranthus: ‘Brede, Brede, tar gys my thie tar dyn thie ayms noght Foshil jee yn dorrys da Brede, aslhig da Brede e heet staigh.’ In English: ‘Bridget, Bridget, come to my house, come to myhouse to-night. Open the door for Bridget, and let Bridget come in.’ After these words wererepeated, the rushes were strewn on the floor by way of a carpet or bed for St. Bridget. A cus-tom very similar to this was also observed in some of the Out-Isles of the ancient Kingdom ofMan.” In these Manx and Highland ceremonies it is obvious that St. Bride, or St. Bridget, is anold heathen goddess of fertility, disguised in a threadbare Christian cloak. Probably she is noother than Brigit, the Celtic goddess of fire and apparently of the crops.Often the marriage of the spirit of vegetation in spring, though not directly represented, isimplied by naming the human representative of the spirit, “the Bride,” and dressing her inwedding attire. Thus in some villages of Altmark at Whitsuntide, while the boys go about car-rying a May-tree or leading a boy enveloped in leaves and flowers, the girls lead about theMay Bride, a girl dressed as a bride with a great nosegay in her hair. They go from house tohouse, the May Bride singing a song in which she asks for a present and tells the inmates ofeach house that if they give her something they will themselves have something the wholeyear through; but if they give her nothing they will themselves have nothing. In some parts ofWestphalia two girls lead a flower-crowned girl called the Whitsuntide Bride from door to door,singing a song in which they ask for eggs.Chapter XIThe Influence of the Sexes on VegetationFROM the preceding examination of the spring and summer festivals of Europe we may inferthat our rude forefathers personified the powers of vegetation as male and female, andattempted, on the principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic, to quicken the growth of treesand plants by representing the marriage of the sylvan deities in the persons of a King andQueen of May, a Whitsun Bridegroom and Bride, and so forth. Such representations wereaccordingly no mere symbolic or allegorical dramas, pastoral plays designed to amuse orinstruct a rustic audience. They were charms intended to make the woods to grow green, thefresh grass to sprout, the corn to shoot, and the flowers to blow. And it was natural to sup-pose that the more closely the mock marriage of the leaf-clad or flower-decked mummersaped the real marriage of the woodland sprites, the more effective would be the charm.Accordingly we may assume with a high degree of probability that the profligacy which notori-ously attended these ceremonies was at one time not an accidental excess but an essentialpart of the rites, and that in the opinion of those who performed them the marriage of treesand plants could not be fertile without the real union of the human sexes. At the present day itmight perhaps be vain to look in civilised Europe for customs of this sort observed for theexplicit purpose of promoting the growth of vegetation. But ruder races in other parts of theworld have consciously employed the intercourse of the sexes as a means to ensure the fruit-fulness of the earth; and some rites which are still, or were till lately, kept up in Europe can bereasonably explained only as stunted relics of a similar practice. The following facts will makethis plain.Page 110"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"For four days before they committed the seed to the earth the Pipiles of Central America keptapart from their wives “in order that on the night before planting they might indulge their pas-sions to the fullest extent; certain persons are even said to have been appointed to performthe sexual act at the very moment when the first seeds were deposited in the ground.” Theuse of their wives at that time was indeed enjoined upon the people by the priests as a reli-gious duty, in default of which it was not lawful to sow the seed. The only possible explana-tion of this custom seems to be that the Indians confused the process by which humanbeings reproduce their kind with the process by which plants discharge the same function,and fancied that by resorting to the former they were simultaneously forwarding the latter. Insome parts of Java, at the season when the bloom will soon be on the rice, the husbandmanand his wife visit their fields by night and there engage in sexual intercourse for the purposeof promoting the growth of the crop. In the Leti, Sarmata, and some other groups of islandswhich lie between the western end of New Guinea and the northern part of Australia, the hea-then population regard the sun as the male principle by whom the earth or female prínciple isfertilised. They call him Upu-lera or Mr. Sun, and represent him under the form of a lampmade of coco-nut leaves, which may be seen hanging everywhere in their houses and in thesacred fig-tree. Under the tree lies a large flat stone, which serves as a sacrificial table. On itthe heads of slain foes were and are still placed in some of the islands. Once a year, at thebeginning of the rainy season, Mr. Sun comes down into the holy fig-tree to fertilise the earth,and to facilitate his descent a ladder with seven rungs is considerately placed at his disposal.It is set up under the tree and is adorned with carved figures of the birds whose shrill clarionheralds the approach of the sun in the east. On this occasion pigs and dogs are sacrificed inprofusion; men and women alike indulge in a saturnalia; and the mystic union of the sun andthe earth is dramatically represented in public, amid song and dance, by the real union of thesexes under the tree. The object of the festival, we are told, is to procure rain, plenty of foodand drink, abundance of cattle and children and riches from Grandfather Sun. They pray thathe may make every she-goat to cast two or three young, the people to multiply, the dead pigsto be replaced by living pigs, the empty rice-baskets to be filled, and so on. And to induce himto grant their requests they offer him pork and rice and liquor, and invite him to fall to. In theBabar Islands a special flag is hoisted at this festival as a symbol of the creative energy ofthe sun; it is of white cotton, about nine feet high, and consists of the figure of a man in anappropriate attitude. It would be unjust to treat these orgies as a mere outburst of unbridledpassion; no doubt they are deliberately and solemnly organised as essential to the fertility ofthe earth and the welfare of man.The same means which are thus adopted to stimulate the growth of the crops are naturallyemployed to ensure the fruitfulness of trees. In some parts of Amboyna, when the state of theclove plantation indicates that the crop is likely to be scanty, the men go naked to the planta-tions by night, and there seek to fertilise the trees precisely as they would impregnatewomen, while at the same time they call out for “More cloves!” This is supposed to make thetrees bear fruit more abundantly.The Baganda of Central Africa believe so strongly in the intimate relation between the inter-course of the sexes and the fertility of the ground that among them a barren wife is generallysent away, because she is supposed to prevent her husband’s garden from bearing fruit. Onthe contrary, a couple who have given proof of extraordinary fertility by becoming the parentsof twins are believed by the Baganda to be endowed with a corresponding power of increas-ing the fruitfulness of the plantain-trees, which furnish them with their staple food. Some littletime after the birth of the twins a ceremony is performed, the object of which clearly is toPage 111"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"transmit the reproductive virtue of the parents to the plantains. The mother lies down on herback in the thick grass near the house and places a flower of the plantain between her legs;then her husband comes and knocks the flower away with his genital member. Further, theparents go through the country performing dances in the gardens of favoured friends, appar-ently for the purpose of causing the plantain-trees to bear fruit more abundantly.In various parts of Europe customs have prevailed both at spring and harvest which are clear-ly based on the same crude notion that the relation of the human sexes to each other can beso used as to quicken the growth of plants. For example, in the Ukraine on St. George’s Day(the twenty-third of April) the priest in his robes, attended by his acolytes, goes out to thefields of the village, where the crops are beginning to show green above the ground, andblesses them. After that the young married people lie down in couples on the sown fields androll several times over on them, in the belief that this will promote the growth of the crops. Insome parts of Russia the priest himself is rolled by women over the sprouting crop, and thatwithout regard to the mud and holes which he may encounter in his beneficent progress. Ifthe shepherd resists or remonstrates, his flock murmurs, “Little Father, you do not really wishus well, you do not wish us to have corn, although you do wish to live on our corn.” In someparts of Germany at harvest the men and women, who have reaped the corn, roll together onthe field. This again is probably a mitigation of an older and ruder custom designed to impartfertility to the fields by methods like those resorted to by the Pipiles of Central America longago and by the cultivators of rice in Java at the present time.To the student who cares to track the devious course of the human mind in its gropings aftertruth, it is of some interest to observe that the same theoretical belief in the sympathetic influ-ence of the sexes on vegetation, which has led some peoples to indulge their passions as ameans of fertilising the earth, has led others to seek the same end by directly oppositemeans. From the moment that they sowed the maize till the time that they reaped it, theIndians of Nicaragua lived chastely, keeping apart from their wives and sleeping in a separateplace. They ate no salt, and drank neither cocoa nor chicha, the fermented liquor made frommaize; in short the season was for them, as the Spanish historian observes, a time of absti-nence. To this day some of the Indian tribes of Central America practise continence for thepurpose of thereby promoting the growth of the crops. Thus we are told that before sowingthe maize the Kekchi Indians sleep apart from their wives, and eat no flesh for five days,while among the Lanquineros and Cajaboneros the period of abstinence from these carnalpleasures extends to thirteen days. So amongst some of the Germans of Transylvania it is arule that no man may sleep with his wife during the whole of the time that he is engaged insowing his fields. The same rule is observed at Kalotaszeg in Hungary; the people think that ifthe custom were not observed the corn would be mildewed. Similarly a Central Australianheadman of the Kaitish tribe strictly abstains from marital relations with his wife all the timethat he is performing magical ceremonies to make the grass grow; for he believes that abreach of this rule would prevent the grass seed from sprouting properly. In some of theMelanesian islands, when the yam vines are being trained, the men sleep near the gardensand never approach their wives; should they enter the garden after breaking this rule of conti-nence the fruits of the garden would be spoilt.If we ask why it is that similar beliefs should logically lead, among different peoples, to suchopposite modes of conduct as strict chastity and more or less open debauchery, the reason,as it presents itself to the primitive mind, is perhaps not very far to seek. If rude man identifieshimself, in a manner, with nature; if he fails to distinguish the impulses and processes in him-self from the methods which nature adopts to ensure the reproduction of plants and animals,Page 112"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"he may leap to one of two conclusions. Either he may infer that by yielding to his appetites hewill thereby assist in the multiplication of plants and animals; or he may imagine that thevigour which he refuses to expend in reproducing his own kind, will form as it were a store ofenergy whereby other creatures, whether vegetable or animal, will somehow benefit in propa-gating their species. Thus from the same crude philosophy, the same primitive notions ofnature and life, the savage may derive by different channels a rule either of profligacy or ofasceticism.To readers bred in religion which is saturated with the ascetic idealism of the East, the expla-nation which I have given of the rule of continence observed under certain circumstances byrude or savage peoples may seem far-fetched and improbable. They may think that moralpurity, which is so intimately associated in their minds with the observance of such a rule, fur-nishes a sufficient explanation of it; they may hold with Milton that chastity in itself is a noblevirtue, and that the restraint which it imposes on one of the strongest impulses of our animalnature marks out those who can submit to it as men raised above the common herd, andtherefore worthy to receive the seal of the divine approbation. However natural this mode ofthought may seem to us, it is utterly foreign and indeed incomprehensible to the savage. If heresists on occasion the sexual instinct, it is from no high idealism, no ethereal aspiration aftermoral purity, but for the sake of some ulterior yet perfectly definite and concrete object, togain which he is prepared to sacrifice the immediate gratification of his senses. That this is ormay be so, the examples I have cited are amply sufficient to prove. They show that where theinstinct of self-preservation, which manifests itself chiefly in the search for food, conflicts orappears to conflict with the instinct which conduces to the propagation of the species, the for-mer instinct, as the primary and more fundamental, is capable of overmastering the latter. Inshort, the savage is willing to restrain his sexual propensity for the sake of food. Anotherobject for the sake of which he consents to exercise the same self-restraint is victory in war.Not only the warrior in the field but his friends at home will often bridle their sensual appetitesfrom a belief that by so doing they will the more easily overcome their enemies. The fallacy ofsuch a belief, like the belief that the chastity of the sower conduces to the growth of the seed,is plain enough to us; yet perhaps the self-restraint which these and the like beliefs, vain andfalse as they are, have imposed on mankind, has not been without its utility in bracing andstrengthening the breed. For strength of character in the race as in the individual consistsmainly in the power of sacrificing the present to the future, of disregarding the immediatetemptations of ephemeral pleasure for more distant and lasting sources of satisfaction. Themore the power is exercised the higher and stronger becomes the character; till the height ofheroism is reached in men who renounce the pleasures of life and even life itself for the sakeof keeping or winning for others, perhaps in distant ages, the blessings of freedom and truth.Chapter XIIThe Sacred Marriage1. DIANA AS A GODDESS OF FERTILITYWE have seen that according to a widespread belief, which is not without a foundation in fact,plants reproduce their kinds through the sexual union of male and female elements, and thaton the principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic this reproduction is supposed to be stimu-lated by the real or mock marriage of men and women, who masquerade for the time beingas spirits of vegetation. Such magical dramas have played a great part in the popular festivalsof Europe, and based as they are on a very crude conception of natural law, it is clear thatthey must have been handed down from a remote antiquity. We shall hardly, therefore, err inPage 113"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"assuming that they date from a time when the forefathers of the civilised nations of Europewere still barbarians, herding their cattle and cultivating patches of corn in the clearings of thevast forests, which then covered the greater part of the continent, from the Mediterranean tothe Arctic Ocean. But if these old spells and enchantments for the growth of leaves and blos-soms, of grass and flowers and fruit, have lingered down to our own time in the shape of pas-toral plays and popular merry-makings, is it not reasonable to suppose that they survived inless attenuated forms some two thousand years ago among the civilised peoples of antiquity?Or, to put it otherwise, is it not likely that in certain festivals of the ancients we may be able todetect the equivalents of our May Day, Whitsuntide, and Midsummer celebrations, with thisdifference, that in those days the ceremonies had not yet dwindled into mere shows and pag-eants, but were still religious or magical rites, in which the actors consciously supported thehigh parts of gods and goddesses? Now in the first chapter of this book we found reason tobelieve that the priest who bore the title of King of the Wood at Nemi had for his mate thegoddess of the grove, Diana herself. May not he and she, as King and Queen of the Wood,have been serious counterparts of the merry mummers who play the King and Queen of May,the Whitsuntide Bridegroom and Bride in modern Europe? and may not their union have beenyearly celebrated in a theogamy or divine marriage? Such dramatic weddings of gods andgoddesses, as we shall see presently, were carried out as solemn religious rites in manyparts of the ancient world; hence there is no intrinsic improbability in the supposition that thesacred grove at Nemi may have been the scene of an annual ceremony of this sort. Directevidence that it was so there is none, but analogy pleads in favour of the view, as I shall nowendeavour to show.Diana was essentially a goddess of the woodlands, as Ceres was a goddess of the corn andBacchus a god of the vine. Her sanctuaries were commonly in groves, indeed every grovewas sacred to her, and she is often associated with the forest god Silvanus in dedications.But whatever her origin may have been, Diana was not always a mere goddess of trees. Likeher Greek sister Artemis, she appears to have developed into a personification of the teeminglife of nature, both animal and vegetable. As mistress of the greenwood she would naturallybe thought to own the beasts, whether wild or tame, that ranged through it, lurking for theirprey in its gloomy depths, munching the fresh leaves and shoots among the boughs, or crop-ping the herbage in the open glades and dells. Thus she might come to be the patron god-dess both of hunters and herdsmen, just as Silvanus was the god not only of woods, but ofcattle. Similarly in Finland the wild beasts of the forest were regarded as the herds of thewoodland god Tapio and of his stately and beautiful wife. No man might slay one of these ani-mals without the gracious permission of their divine owners. Hence the hunter prayed to thesylvan deities, and vowed rich offerings to them if they would drive the game across his path.And cattle also seem to have enjoyed the protection of those spirits of the woods, both whenthey were in their stalls and while they strayed in the forest. Before the Gayos of Sumatrahunt deer, wild goats, or wild pigs with hounds in the woods, they deem it necessary to obtainthe leave of the unseen Lord of the forest. This is done according to a prescribed form by aman who has special skill in woodcraft. He lays down a quid of betel before a stake which iscut in a particular way to represent the Lord of the Wood, and having done so he prays to thespirit to signify his consent or refusal. In his treatise on hunting, Arrian tells us that the Celtsused to offer an annual sacrifice to Artemis on her birthday, purchasing the sacrificial victimwith the fines which they had paid into her treasury for every fox, hare, and roe that they hadkilled in the course of the year. The custom clearly implied that the wild beasts belonged tothe goddess, and that she must be compensated for their slaughter.But Diana was not merely a patroness of wild beasts, a mistress of woods and hills, of lonelyPage 114"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"glades and sounding rivers; conceived as the moon, and especially, it would seem, as theyellow harvest moon, she filled the farmer’s grange with goodly fruits, and heard the prayersof women in travail. In her sacred grove at Nemi, as we have seen, she was especially wor-shipped as a goddess of childbirth, who bestowed offspring on men and women. Thus Diana,like the Greek Artemis, with whom she was constantly identified, may be described as a god-dess of nature in general and of fertility in particular. We need not wonder, therefore, that inher sanctuary on the Aventine she was represented by an image copied from the many-breasted idol of the Ephesian Artemis, with all its crowded emblems of exuberant fecundity.Hence too we can understand why an ancient Roman law, attributed to King Tullus Hostilius,prescribed that, when incest had been committed, an expiatory sacrifice should be offered bythe pontiffs in the grove of Diana. For we know that the crime of incest is commonly sup-posed to cause a dearth; hence it would be meet that atonement for the offence should bemade to the goddess of fertility.Now on the principle that the goddess of fertility must herself be fertile, it behoved Diana tohave a male partner. Her mate, if the testimony of Servius may be trusted, was that Virbiuswho had his representative, or perhaps rather his embodiment, in the King of the Wood atNemi. The aim of their union would be to promote the fruitfulness of the earth, of animals, andof mankind; and it might naturally be thought that this object would be more surely attained ifthe sacred nuptials were celebrated every year, the parts of the divine bride and bridegroombeing played either by their images or by living persons. No ancient writer mentions that thiswas done in the grove at Nemi; but our knowledge of the Arician ritual is so scanty that thewant of information on this head can hardly count as a fatal objection to the theory. That theo-ry, in the absence of direct evidence, must necessarily be based on the analogy of similarcustoms practised elsewhere. Some modern examples of such customs, more or less degen-erate, were described in the last chapter. Here we shall consider their ancient counterparts.2. THE MARRIAGE OF THE GODSAt Babylon the imposing sanctuary of Bel rose like a pyramid above the city in a series ofeight towers or stories, planted one on the top of the other. On the highest tower, reached byan ascent which wound about all the rest, there stood a spacious temple, and in the temple agreat bed, magnificently draped and cushioned, with a golden table beside it. In the temple noimage was to be seen, and no human being passed the night there, save a single woman,whom, according to the Chaldean priests, the god chose from among all the women ofBabylon. They said that the deity himself came into the temple at night and slept in the greatbed; and the woman, as a consort of the god, might have no intercourse with mortal man.At Thebes in Egypt a woman slept in the temple of Ammon as the consort of the god, and,like the human wife of Bel at Babylon, she was said to have no commerce with a man. InEgyptian texts she is often mentioned as “the divine consort,” and usually she was no less apersonage than the Queen of Egypt herself. For, according to the Egyptians, their monarchswere actually begotten by the god Ammon, who assumed for the time being the form of thereigning king, and in that disguise had intercourse with the queen. The divine procreation iscarved and painted in great detail on the walls of two of the oldest temples in Egypt, those ofDeir el Bahari and Luxor; and the inscriptions attached to the paintings leave no doubt as tothe meaning of the scenes.At Athens the god of the vine, Dionysus, was annually married to the Queen, and it appearsthat the consummation of the divine union, as well as the espousals, was enacted at the cer-Page 115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"emony; but whether the part of the god was played by a man or an image we do not know.We learn from Aristotle that the ceremony took place in the old official residence of the King,known as the Cattle-stall, which stood near the Prytaneum or Town-hall on the north-easternslope of the Acropolis. The object of the marriage can hardly have been any other than that ofensuring the fertility of the vines and other fruit-trees of which Dionysus was the god. Thusboth in form and in meaning the ceremony would answer to the nuptials of the King andQueen of May.In the great mysteries solemnised at Eleusis in the month of September the union of the sky-god Zeus with the corn-goddess Demeter appears to have been represented by the union ofthe hierophant with the priestess of Demeter, who acted the parts of god and goddess. Buttheir intercourse was only dramatic or symbolical, for the hierophant had temporarily deprivedhimself of his virility by an application of hemlock. The torches having been extinguished, thepair descended into a murky place, while the throng of worshippers awaited in anxious sus-pense the result of the mystic congress, on which they believed their own salvation todepend. After a time the hierophant reappeared, and in a blaze of light silently exhibited tothe assembly a reaped ear of corn, the fruit of the divine marriage. Then in a loud voice heproclaimed, “Queen Brimo has brought forth a sacred boy Brimos,” by which he meant, “TheMighty One has brought forth the Mighty.” The corn-mother in fact had given birth to her child,the corn, and her travail-pangs were enacted in the sacred drama. This revelation of thereaped corn appears to have been the crowning act of the mysteries. Thus through the glam-our shed round these rites by the poetry and philosophy of later ages there still looms, like adistant landscape through a sunlit haze, a simple rustic festival designed to cover the wideEleusinian plain with a plenteous harvest by wedding the goddess of the corn to the sky-god,who fertilised the bare earth with genial showers. Every few years the people of Plataea, inBoeotia, held a festival called the Little Daedala, at which they felled an oak-tree in an ancientoak forest. Out of the tree they carved an image, and having dressed it as a bride, they set iton a bullock-cart with a bridesmaid beside it. The image seems then to have been drawn tothe bank of the river Asopus and back to the town, attended by a piping and dancing crowd.Every sixty years the festival of the Great Daedala was celebrated by all the people ofBoeotia; and at it all the images, fourteen in number, which had accumulated at the lesserfestivals, were dragged on wains in procession to the river Asopus and then to the top ofMount Cithaeron, where they were burnt on a great pyre. The story told to explain the festi-vals suggests that they celebrated the marriage of Zeus to Hera, represented by the oakenimage in bridal array. In Sweden every year a life-size image of Frey, the god of fertility, bothanimal and vegetable, was drawn about the country in a waggon attended by a beautiful girlwho was called the god’s wife. She acted also as his priestess in his great temple at Upsala.Wherever the waggon came with the image of the god and his blooming young bride, thepeople crowded to meet them and offered sacrifices for a fruitful year.Thus the custom of marrying gods either to images or to human beings was widespreadamong the nations of antiquity. The ideas on which such a custom is based are too crude toallow us to doubt that the civilised Babylonians, Egyptians, and Greeks inherited it from theirbarbarous or savage forefathers. This presumption is strengthened when we find rites of asimilar kind in vogue among the lower races. Thus, for example, we are told that once upon atime the Wotyaks of the Malmyz district in Russia were distressed by a series of bad har-vests. They did not know what to do, but at last concluded that their powerful but mischievi-ous god Keremet must be angry at being unmarried. So a deputation of elders visited theWotyaks of Cura and came to an understanding with them on the subject. Then they returnedhome, laid in a large stock of brandy, and having made ready a gaily decked waggon andPage 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"horses, they drove in procession with bells ringing, as they do when they are fetching home abride, to the sacred grove at Cura. There they ate and drank merrily all night, and next morn-ing they cut a square piece of turf in the grove and took it home with them. After that, thoughit fared well with the people of Malmyz, it fared ill with the people of Cura; for in Malmyz thebread was good, but in Cura it was bad. Hence the men of Cura who had consented to themarriage were blamed and roughly handled by their indignant fellow-villagers. “What theymeant by this marriage ceremony,” says the writer who reports it, “it is not easy to imagine.Perhaps, as Bechterew thinks, they meant to marry Keremet to the kindly and fruitfulMukylcin, the Earth-wife, in order that she might influence him for good.” When wells are dugin Bengal, a wooden image of a god is made and married to the goddess of water.Often the bride destined for the god is not a log or a cloud, but a living woman of flesh andblood. The Indians of a village in Peru have been known to marry a beautiful girl, about four-teen years of age, to a stone shaped like a human being, which they regarded as a god(huaca). All the villagers took part in the marriage ceremony, which lasted three days, andwas attended with much revelry. The girl thereafter remained a virgin and sacrificed to the idolfor the people. They showed her the utmost reverence and deemed her divine. Every yearabout the middle of March, when the season for fishing with the dragnet began, theAlgonquins and Hurons married their nets to two young girls, aged six or seven. At the wed-ding feast the net was placed between the two maidens, and was exhorted to take courageand catch many fish. The reason for choosing the brides so young was to make sure thatthey were virgins. The origin of the custom is said to have been this. One year, when the fish-ing season came round, the Algonquins cast their nets as usual, but took nothing. Surprisedat their want of success, they did not know what to make of it, till the soul or genius (oki) ofthe net appeared to them in the likeness of a tall well-built man, who said to them in a greatpassion, “I have lost my wife and I cannot find one who has known no other man but me; thatis why you do not succeed, and why you never will succeed till you give me satisfaction onthis head.” So the Algonquins held a council and resolved to appease the spirit of the net bymarrying him to two such very young girls that he could have no ground of complaint on thatscore for the future. They did so, and the fishing turned out all that could be wished. The thinggot wind among their neighbours the Hurons, and they adopted the custom. A share of thecatch was always given to the families of the two girls who acted as brides of the net for theyear.The Oraons of Bengal worship the Earth as a goddess, and annually celebrate her marriagewith the Sun-god Dharme at the time when the sal tree is in blossom. The ceremony is as fol-lows. All bathe, then the men repair to the sacred grove (sarna), while the women assembleat the house of the village priest. After sacrificing some fowls to the Sun-god and the demonof the grove, the men eat and drink. “The priest is then carried back to the village on theshoulders of a strong man. Near the village the women meet the men and wash their feet.With beating of drums and singing, dancing, and jumping, all proceed to the priest’s house,which has been decorated with leaves and flowers. Then the usual form of marriage is per-formed between the priest and his wife, symbolising the supposed union between Sun andEarth. After the ceremony all eat and drink and make merry; they dance and sing obscenesongs, and finally indulge in the vilest orgies. The object is to move the mother earth tobecome fruitful.” Thus the Sacred Marriage of the Sun and Earth, personated by the priestand his wife, is celebrated as a charm to ensure the fertility of the ground; and for the samepurpose, on the principle of homoeopathic magic, the people indulge in licentious orgy.It deserves to be remarked that the supernatural being to whom women are married is often aPage 117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"god or spirit of water. Thus Mukasa, the god of the Victoria Nyanza lake, who was propitiatedby the Baganda every time they undertook a long voyage, had virgins provided for him toserve as his wives. Like the Vestals they were bound to chastity, but unlike the Vestals theyseem to have been often unfaithful. The custom lasted until Mwanga was converted toChristianity. The Akikuyu of British East Africa worship the snake of a certain river, and atintervals of several years they marry the snake-god to women, but especially to young girls.For this purpose huts are built by order of the medicine-men, who there consummate thesacred marriage with the credulous female devotees. If the girls do not repair to the huts oftheir own accord in sufficient numbers, they are seized and dragged thither to the embracesof the deity. The offspring of these mystic unions appears to be fathered on God (ngai); cer-tainly there are children among the Akikuyu who pass for children of God. It is said that once,when the inhabitants of Cayeli in Buru—an East Indian island—were threatened with destruc-tion by a swarm of crocodiles, they ascribed the misfortune to a passion which the prince ofthe crocodiles had conceived for a certain girl. Accordingly, they compelled the damsel’sfather to dress her in bridal array and deliver her over to the clutches of her crocodile lover.Ausage of the same sort is reported to have prevailed in the Maldive Islands before the con-version of the inhabitants to Islam. The famous Arab traveller Ibn Batutah has described thecustom and the manner in which it came to an end. He was assured by several trustworthynatives, whose names he gives, that when the people of the islands were idolaters thereappeared to them every month an evil spirit among the jinn, who came from across the sea inthe likeness of a ship full of burning lamps. The wont of the inhabitants, as soon as they per-ceived him, was to take a young virgin, and, having adorned her, to lead her to a heathentemple that stood on the shore, with a window looking out to sea. There they left the damselfor the night, and when they came back in the morning they found her a maid no more, anddead. Every month they drew lots, and he upon whom the lot fell gave up his daughter to thejinnee of the sea. The last of the maidens thus offered to the demon was rescued by a piousBerber, who by reciting the Koran succeeded in driving the jinnee back into the sea.Ibn Batutah’s narrative of the demon lover and his mortal brides closely resembles a well-known type of folk-tale, of which versions have been found from Japan and Annam in theEast to Senegambia, Scandinavia, and Scotland in the West. The story varies in details frompeople to people, but as commonly told it runs thus. A certain country is infested by a many-headed serpent, dragon, or other monster, which would destroy the whole people if a humanvictim, generally a virgin, were not delivered up to him periodically. Many victims have per-ished, and at last it has fallen to the lot of the king’s own daughter to be sacrificed. She isexposed to the monster, but the hero of the tale, generally a young man of humble birth, inter-poses in her behalf, slays the monster, and receives the hand of the princess as his reward.In many of the tales the monster, who is sometimes described as a serpent, inhabits thewater of a sea, a lake, or a fountain. In other versions he is a serpent or dragon who takespossession of the springs of water, and only allows the water to flow or the people to makeuse of it on condition of receiving a human victim.It would probably be a mistake to dismiss all these tales as pure inventions of the story-teller.Rather we may suppose that they reflect a real custom of sacrificing girls or women to be thewives of waterspirits, who are very often conceived as great serpents or dragons.Chapter XIIIThe Kings of Rome and AlbaPage 118"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"1. NUMA AND EGERIAFROM the foregoing survey of custom and legend we may infer that the sacred marriage ofthe powers both of vegetation and of water has been celebrated by many peoples for thesake of promoting the fertility of the earth, on which the life of animals and men ultimatelydepends, and that in such rites the part of the divine bridegroom or bride is often sustained bya man or woman. The evidence may, therefore, lend some countenance to the conjecture thatin the sacred grove at Nemi, where the powers of vegetation and of water manifested them-selves in the fair forms of shady woods, tumbling cascades, and glassy lake, a marriage likethat of our King and Queen of May was annually celebrated between the mortal King of theWood and the immortal Queen of the Wood, Diana. In this connexion an important figure inthe grove was the water-nymph Egeria, who was worshipped by pregnant women becauseshe, like Diana, could grant them an easy delivery. From this it seems fairly safe to concludethat, like many other springs, the water of Egeria was credited with a power of facilitating con-ception as well as delivery. The votive offerings found on the spot, which clearly refer to thebegetting of children, may possibly have been dedicated to Egeria rather than to Diana, orperhaps we should rather say that the water-nymph Egeria is only another form of the greatnature-goddess Diana herself, the mistress of sounding rivers as well as of umbrageouswoods, who had her home by the lake and her mirror in its calm waters, and whose Greekcounterpart Artemis loved to haunt meres and springs. The identification of Egeria with Dianais confirmed by a statement of Plutarch that Egeria was one of the oak-nymphs whom theRomans believed to preside over every green oak-grove; for, while Diana was a goddess ofthe woodlands in general, she appears to have been intimately associated with oaks in partic-ular, especially at her sacred grove of Nemi. Perhaps, then, Egeria was the fairy of a springthat flowed from the roots of a sacred oak. Such a spring is said to have gushed from the footof the great oak at Dodona, and from its murmurous flow the priestess drew oracles. Amongthe Greeks a draught of water from certain sacred springs or wells was supposed to conferprophetic powers. This would explain the more than mortal wisdom with which, according totradition, Egeria inspired her royal husband or lover Numa. When we remember how veryoften in early society the king is held responsible for the fall of rain and the fruitfulness of theearth, it seems hardly rash to conjecture that in the legend of the nuptials of Numa andEgeria we have a reminiscence of a sacred marriage which the old Roman kings regularlycontracted with a goddess of vegetation and water for the purpose of enabling him to dis-charge his divine or magical functions. In such a rite the part of the goddess might be playedeither by an image or a woman, and if by a woman, probably by the Queen. If there is anytruth in this conjecture, we may suppose that the King and Queen of Rome masqueraded asgod and goddess at their marriage, exactly as the King and Queen of Egypt appear to havedone. The legend of Numa and Egeria points to a sacred grove rather than to a house as thescene of the nuptial union, which, like the marriage of the King and Queen of May, or of thevine-god and the Queen of Athens, may have been annually celebrated as a charm to ensurethe fertility not only of the earth but of man and beast. Now, according to some accounts, thescene of the marriage was no other than the sacred grove of Nemi, and on quite independentgrounds we have been led to suppose that in that same grove the King of the Wood waswedded to Diana. The convergence of the two distinct lines of enquiry suggests that the leg-endary union of the Roman king with Egeria may have been a reflection or duplicate of theunion of the King of the Wood with Egeria or her double Diana. This does not imply that theRoman kings ever served as Kings of the Wood in the Arician grove, but only that they mayoriginally have been invested with a sacred character of the same general kind, and mayhave held office on similar terms. To be more explicit, it is possible that they reigned, not byright of birth, but in virtue of their supposed divinity as representatives or embodiments of aPage 119"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"god, and that as such they mated with a goddess, and had to prove their fitness from time totime to discharge their divine functions by engaging in a severe bodily struggle, which mayoften have proved fatal to them, leaving the crown to their victorious adversary. Our knowl-edge of the Roman kingship is far too scanty to allow us to affirm any one of these proposi-tions with confidence; but at least there are some scattered hints or indications of a similarityin all these respects between the priests of Nemi and the kings of Rome, or perhaps ratherbetween their remote predecessors in the dark ages which preceded the dawn of legend.2. THE KING AS JUPITERIn the first place, then, it would seem that the Roman king personated no less a deity thanJupiter himself. For down to imperial times victorious generals celebrating a triumph, andmagistrates presiding at the games in the Circus, wore the costume of Jupiter, which was bor-rowed for the occasion from his great temple on the Capitol; and it has been held with a highdegree of probability both by ancients and moderns that in so doing they copied the tradi-tionary attire and insignia of the Roman kings. They rode a chariot drawn by four laurel-crowned horses through the city, where every one else went on foot: they wore purple robesembroidered or spangled with gold: in the right hand they bore a branch of laurel, and in theleft hand an ivory sceptre topped with an eagle: a wreath of laurel crowned their brows: theirface was reddened with vermilion; and over their head a slave held a heavy crown of massygold fashioned in the likeness of oak leaves. In this attire the assimilation of the man to thegod comes out above all in the eagle-topped sceptre, the oaken crown, and the reddenedface. For the eagle was the bird of Jove, the oak was his sacred tree, and the face of hisimage standing in his four-horse chariot on the Capitol was in like manner regularly dyed redon festivals; indeed, so important was it deemed to keep the divine features properly rougedthat one of the first duties of the censors was to contract for having this done. As the tri-umphal procession always ended in the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol, it was peculiarlyappropriate that the head of the victor should be graced by a crown of oak leaves, for notonly was every oak consecrated to Jupiter, but the Capitoline temple of the god was said tohave been built by Romulus beside a sacred oak, venerated by shepherds, to which the kingattached the spoils won by him from the enemy’s general in battle. We are expressly told thatthe oak crown was sacred to Capitoline Jupiter; a passage of Ovid proves that it was regard-ed as the god’s special emblem.According to a tradition which we have no reason to reject, Rome was founded by settlersfrom Alba Longa, a city situated on the slope of the Alban hills, overlooking the lake and theCampagna. Hence if the Roman kings claimed to be representatives or embodiments ofJupiter, the god of the sky, of the thunder, and of the oak, it is natural to suppose that thekings of Alba, from whom the founder of Rome traced his descent, may have set up the sameclaim before them. Now the Alban dynasty bore the name of Silvii or Wood, and it can hardlybe without significance that in the vision of the historic glories of Rome revealed to Aeneas inthe underworld, Virgil, an antiquary as well as a poet, should represent all the line of Silvii ascrowned with oak. A chaplet of oak leaves would thus seem to have been part of the insigniaof the old kings of Alba Longa as of their successors the kings of Rome; in both cases itmarked the monarch as the human representative of the oak-god. The Roman annals recordthat one of the kings of Alba, Romulus, Remulus, or Amulius Silvius by name, set up for beinga god in his own person, the equal or superior of Jupiter. To support his pretensions and over-awe his subjects, he constructed machines whereby he mimicked the clap of thunder and theflash of lightning. Diodorus relates that in the season of fruitage, when thunder is loud andfrequent, the king commanded his soldiers to drown the roar of heaven’s artillery by clashingPage 120"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"their swords against their shields. But he paid the penalty of his impiety, for he perished, heand his house, struck by a thunderbolt in the midst of a dreadful storm. Swollen by the rain,the Alban lake rose in flood and drowned his palace. But still, says an ancient historian, whenthe water is low and the surface unruffled by a breeze, you may see the ruins of the palace atthe bottom of the clear lake. Taken along with the similar story of Salmoneus, king of Elis, thislegend points to a real custom observed by the early kings of Greece and Italy, who, like theirfellows in Africa down to modern times, may have been expected to produce rain and thunderfor the good of the crops. The priestly king Numa passed for an adept in the art of drawingdown lightning from the sky. Mock thunder, we know, has been made by various peoples as arain-charm in modern times; why should it not have been made by kings in antiquity?Thus, if the kings of Alba and Rome imitated Jupiter as god of the oak by wearing a crown ofoak leaves, they seem also to have copied him in his character of a weather-god by pretend-ing to make thunder and lightning. And if they did so, it is probable that, like Jupiter in heavenand many kings on earth, they also acted as public rain-makers, wringing showers from thedark sky by their enchantments whenever the parched earth cried out for the refreshing mois-ture. At Rome the sluices of heaven were opened by means of a sacred stone, and the cere-mony appears to have formed part of the ritual of Jupiter Elicius, the god who elicits from theclouds the flashing lightning and the dripping rain. And who so well fitted to perform the cere-mony as the king, the living representative of the sky-god?If the kings of Rome aped Capitoline Jove, their predecessors the kings of Alba probably laidthemselves out to mimic the great Latian Jupiter, who had his seat above the city on the sum-mit of the Alban Mountain. Latinus, the legendary ancestor of the dynasty, was said to havebeen changed into Latian Jupiter after vanishing from the world in the mysterious fashioncharacteristic of the old Latin kings. The sanctuary of the god on the top of the mountain wasthe religious centre of the Latin League, as Alba was its political capital till Rome wrested thesupremacy from its ancient rival. Apparently no temple, in our sense of the word, was evererected to Jupiter on this his holy mountain; as god of the sky and thunder he appropriatelyreceived the homage of his worshippers in the open air. The massive wall, of which someremains still enclose the old garden of the Passionist monastery, seems to have been part ofthe sacred precinct which Tarquin the Proud, the last king of Rome, marked out for thesolemn annual assembly of the Latin League. The god’s oldest sanctuary on this airy moun-tain-top was a grove; and bearing in mind not merely the special consecration of the oak toJupiter, but also the traditional oak crown of the Alban kings and the analogy of the CapitolineJupiter at Rome, we may suppose that the trees in the grove were oaks. We know that inantiquity Mount Algidus, an outlying group of the Alban hills, was covered with dark forests ofoak; and among the tribes who belonged to the Latin League in the earliest days, and wereentitled to share the flesh of the white bull sacrificed on the Alban Mount, there was onewhose members styled themselves the Men of the Oak, doubtless on account of the woodsamong which they dwelt.But we should err if we pictured to ourselves the country as covered in historical times withan unbroken forest of oaks. Theophrastus has left us a description of the woods of Latium asthey were in the fourth century before Christ. He says: “The land of the Latins is all moist. Theplains produce laurels, myrtles, and wonderful beeches; for they fell trees of such a size thata single stem suffices for the keel of a Tyrrhenian ship. Pines and firs grow in the mountains.What they call the land of Circe is a lofty headland thickly wooded with oak, myrtle, and luxu-riant laurels. The natives say that Circe dwelt there, and they show the grave of Elpenor, fromwhich grow myrtles such as wreaths are made of, whereas the other myrtle-trees are tall.”Page 121"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Thus the prospect from the top of the Alban Mount in the early days of Rome must have beenvery different in some respects from what it is to-day. The purple Apennines, indeed, in theireternal calm on the one hand, and the shining Mediterranean in its eternal unrest on theother, no doubt looked then much as they look now, whether bathed in sunshine, or che-quered by the fleeting shadows of clouds; but instead of the desolate brown expanse of thefever-stricken Campagna, spanned by its long lines of ruined aqueducts, like the broken arch-es of the bridge in the vision of Mirza, the eye must have ranged over woodlands thatstretched away, mile after mile, on all sides, till their varied hues of green or autumnal scarletand gold melted insensibly into the blue of the distant mountains and sea.But Jupiter did not reign alone on the top of his holy mountain. He had his consort with him,the goddess Juno, who was worshipped here under the same title, Moneta, as on the Capitolat Rome. As the oak crown was sacred to Jupiter and Juno on the Capitol, so we may sup-pose it was on the Alban Mount, from which the Capitoline worship was derived. Thus theoak-god would have his oak-goddess in the sacred oak grove. So at Dodona the oak-godZeus was coupled with Dione, whose very name is only a dialectically different form of Juno;and so on the top of Mount Cithaeron, as we have seen, he appears to have been periodical-ly wedded to an oaken image of Hera. It is probable, though it cannot be positively proved,that the sacred marriage of Jupiter and Juno was annually celebrated by all the peoples ofthe Latin stock in the month which they named after the goddess, the midsummer month ofJune.If at any time of the year the Romans celebrated the sacred marriage of Jupiter and Juno, asthe Greeks commonly celebrated the corresponding marriage of Zeus and Hera, we may sup-pose that under the Republic the ceremony was either performed over images of the divinepair or acted by the Flamen Dialis and his wife the Flaminica. For the Flamen Dialis was thepriest of Jove; indeed, ancient and modern writers have regarded him, with much probability,as a living image of Jupiter, a human embodiment of the sky-god. In earlier times the Romanking, as representative of Jupiter, would naturally play the part of the heavenly bridegroom atthe sacred marriage, while his queen would figure as the heavenly bride, just as in Egypt theking and queen masqueraded in the character of deities, and as at Athens the queen annuallywedded the vine-god Dionysus. That the Roman king and queen should act the parts ofJupiter and Juno would seem all the more natural because these deities themselves bore thetitle of King and Queen.Whether that was so or not, the legend of Numa and Egeria appears to embody a reminis-cence of a time when the priestly king himself played the part of the divine bridegroom; andas we have seen reason to suppose that the Roman kings personated the oak-god, whileEgeria is expressly said to have been an oak-nymph, the story of their union in the sacredgrove raises a presumption that at Rome in the regal period a ceremony was periodically per-formed exactly analogous to that which was annually celebrated at Athens down to the timeof Aristotle. The marriage of the King of Rome to the oak-goddess, like the wedding of thevine-god to the Queen of Athens, must have been intended to quicken the growth of vegeta-tion by homoeopathic magic. Of the two forms of the rite we can hardly doubt that the Romanwas the older, and that long before the northern invaders met with the vine on the shores ofthe Mediterranean their forefathers had married the tree-god to the tree-goddess in the vastoak forests of Central and Northern Europe. In the England of our day the forests have most-ly disappeared, yet still on many a village green and in many a country lane a faded image ofthe sacred marriage lingers in the rustic pageantry of May Day.Page 122"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Chapter XIVThe Succession to the Kingdom in Ancient LatiumIN regard to the Roman king, whose priestly functions were inherited by his successor theking of the Sacred Rites, the foregoing discussion has led us to the following conclusions. Herepresented and indeed personated Jupiter, the great god of the sky, the thunder, and theoak, and in that character made rain, thunder, and lightning for the good of his subjects, likemany more kings of the weather in other parts of the world. Further, he not only mimicked theoak-god by wearing an oak wreath and other insignia of divinity, but he was married to anoak-nymph Egeria, who appears to have been merely a local form of Diana in her characterof a goddess of woods, of waters, and of child-birth. All these conclusions, which we havereached mainly by a consideration of the Roman evidence, may with great probability beapplied to the other Latin communities. They too probably had of old their divine or priestlykings, who transmitted their religious functions, without their civil powers, to their successorsthe Kings of the Sacred Rites.But we have still to ask, What was the rule of succession to the kingdom among the old Latintribes? According to tradition, there were in all eight kings of Rome, and with regard to thefive last of them, at all events, we can hardly doubt that they actually sat on the throne, andthat the traditional history of their reigns is, in its main outlines, correct. Now it is very remark-able that though the first king of Rome, Romulus, is said to have been descended from theroyal house of Alba, in which the kingship is represented as hereditary in the male line, notone of the Roman kings was immediately succeeded by his son on the throne. Yet several leftsons or grandsons behind them. On the other hand, one of them was descended from a for-mer king through his mother, not through his father, and three of the kings, namely Tatius, theelder Tarquin, and Servius Tullius, were succeeded by their sons-in-law, who were all eitherforeigners or of foreign descent. This suggests that the right to the kingship was transmittedin the female line, and was actually exercised by foreigners who married the royal princesses.To put it in technical language, the succession to the kingship at Rome and probably inLatium generally would seem to have been determined by certain rules which have mouldedearly society in many parts of the world, namely exogamy, beena marriage, and female kin-ship or mother-kin. Exogamy is the rule which obliges a man to marry a woman of a differentclan from his own: beena marriage is the rule that he must leave the home of his birth andlive with his wife’s people; and female kinship or mother-kin is the system of tracing relation-ship and transmitting the family name through women instead of through men. If these princi-ples regulated descent of the kingship among the ancient Latins, the state of things in thisrespect would be somewhat as follows. The political and religious centre of each communitywould be the perpetual fire on the king’s hearth tended by Vestal Virgins of the royal clan. Theking would be a man of another clan, perhaps of another town or even of another race, whohad married a daughter of his predecessor and received the kingdom with her. The childrenwhom he had by her would inherit their mother’s name, not his; the daughters would remainat home; the sons, when they grew up, would go away into the world, marry, and settle intheir wives’ country, whether as kings or commoners. Of the daughters who stayed at home,some or all would be dedicated as Vestal Virgins for a longer or shorter time to the service ofthe fire on the hearth, and one of them would in time become the consort of her father’s suc-cessor.This hypothesis has the advantage of explaining in a simple and natural way some obscurefeatures in the traditional history of the Latin kingship. Thus the legends which tell how Latinkings were born of virgin mothers and divine fathers become at least more intelligible. For,Page 123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"stripped of their fabulous element, tales of this sort mean no more than that a woman hasbeen gotten with child by a man unknown; and this uncertainty as to fatherhood is more easi-ly compatible with a system of kinship which ignores paternity than with one which makes itall-important. If at the birth of the Latin kings their fathers were really unknown, the fact pointseither to a general looseness of life in the royal family or to a special relaxation of moral ruleson certain occasions, when men and women reverted for a season to the licence of an earlierage. Such Saturnalias are not uncommon at some stages of social evolution. In our owncountry traces of them long survived in the practices of May Day and Whitsuntide, if not ofChristmas. Children born of more or less promiscuous intercourse which characterises festi-vals of this kind would naturally be fathered on the god to whom the particular festival wasdedicated.In this connexion it may be significant that a festival of jollity and drunkenness was celebratedby the plebeians and slaves at Rome on Midsummer Day, and that the festival was speciallyassociated with the fireborn King Servius Tullius, being held in honour of Fortuna, the god-dess who loved Servius as Egeria loved Numa. The popular merrymakings at this seasonincluded foot-races and boat-races; the Tiber was gay with flower-wreathed boats, in whichyoung folk sat quaffing wine. The festival appears to have been a sort of MidsummerSaturnalia answering to the real Saturnalia which fell at Midwinter. In modern Europe, as weshall learn later on, the great Midsummer festival has been above all a festival of lovers andof fire; one of its principal features is the pairing of sweethearts, who leap over the bonfireshand in hand or throw flowers across the flames to each other. And many omens of love andmarriage are drawn from the flowers which bloom at this mystic season. It is the time of theroses and of love. Yet the innocence and beauty of such festivals in modern times ought notto blind us to the likelihood that in earlier days they were marked by coarser features, whichwere probably of the essence of the rites. Indeed, among the rude Esthonian peasantry thesefeatures seem to have lingered down to our own generation, if not to the present day. Oneother feature in the Roman celebration of Midsummer deserves to be specially noticed. Thecustom of rowing in flower-decked boats on the river on this day proves that it was to someextent a water festival; and water has always, down to modern times, played a conspicuouspart in the rites of Midsummer Day, which explains why the Church, in throwing its cloak overthe old heathen festival, chose to dedicate it to St. John the Baptist.The hypothesis that the Latin kings may have been begotten at an annual festival of love isnecessarily a mere conjecture, though the traditional birth of Numa at the festival of theParilia, when shepherds leaped across the spring bonfires, as lovers leap across theMidsummer fires, may perhaps be thought to lend it a faint colour of probability. But it is quitepossible that the uncertainty as to their fathers may not have arisen till long after the death ofthe kings, when their figures began to melt away into the cloudland of fable, assuming fantas-tic shapes and gorgeous colouring as they passed from earth to heaven. If they were alienimmigrants, strangers and pilgrims in the land they ruled over, it would be natural enough thatthe people should forget their lineage, and forgetting it should provide them with another,which made up in lustre what it lacked in truth. The final apotheosis, which represented thekings not merely as sprung from gods but as themselves deities incarnate, would be muchfacilitated if in their lifetime, as we have seen reason to think, they had actually laid claim todivinity.If among the Latins the women of royal blood always stayed at home and received as theirconsorts men of another stock, and often of another country, who reigned as kings in virtue oftheir marriage with a native princess, we can understand not only why foreigners wore thePage 124"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"crown at Rome, but also why foreign names occur in the list of the Alban kings. In a state ofsociety where nobility is reckoned only through women—in other words, where descentthrough the mother is everything, and descent through the father is nothing—no objection willbe felt to uniting girls of the highest rank to men of humble birth, even to aliens or slaves, pro-vided that in themselves the men appear to be suitable mates. What really matters is that theroyal stock, on which the prosperity and even the existence of the people is supposed todepend, should be perpetuated in a vigorous and efficient form, and for this purpose it is nec-essary that the women of the royal family should bear children to men who are physically andmentally fit, according to the standard of early society, to discharge the important duty of pro-creation. Thus the personal qualities of the kings at this stage of social evolution are deemedof vital importance. If they, like their consorts, are of royal and divine descent, so much thebetter; but it is not essential that they should be so.At Athens, as at Rome, we find traces of succession to the throne by marriage with a royalprincess; for two of the most ancient kings of Athens, namely Cecrops and Amphictyon, aresaid to have married the daughters of their predecessors. This tradition is to a certain extentconfirmed by evidence, pointing to the conclusion that at Athens male kinship was precededby female kinship.Further, if I am right in supposing that in ancient Latium the royal families kept their daughtersat home and sent forth their sons to marry princesses and reign among their wives’ people, itwill follow that the male descendants would reign in successive generations over differentkingdoms. Now this seems to have happened both in ancient Greece and in ancient Sweden;from which we may legitimately infer that it was a custom practised by more than one branchof the Aryan stock in Europe. Many Greek traditions relate how a prince left his native land,and going to a far country married the king’s daughter and succeeded to the kingdom.Various reasons are assigned by ancient Greek writers for these migrations of the princes. Acommon one is that the king’s son had been banished for murder. This would explain verywell why he fled his own land, but it is no reason at all why he should become king of anoth-er. We may suspect that such reasons are afterthoughts devised by writers, who, accustomedto the rule that a son should succeed to his father’s property and kingdom, were hard put to itto account for so many traditions of kings’ sons who quitted the land of their birth to reignover a foreign kingdom. In Scandinavian tradition we meet with traces of similar customs. Forwe read of daughters’ husbands who received a share of the kingdoms of their royal fathers-in-law, even when these fathers-in-law had sons of their own; in particular, during the fivegenerations which preceded Harold the Fair-haired, male members of the Ynglingar family,which is said to have come from Sweden, are reported in the Heimskringla or Sagas of theNorwegian Kings to have obtained at least six provinces in Norway by marriage with thedaughters of the local kings.Thus it would seem that among some Aryan peoples, at a certain stage of their social evolu-tion, it has been customary to regard women and not men as the channels in which royalblood flows, and to bestow the kingdom in each successive generation on a man of anotherfamily, and often of another country, who marries one of the princesses and reigns over hiswife’s people. A common type of popular tale, which relates how an adventurer, coming to astrange land, wins the hand of the king’s daughter and with her the half or the whole of thekingdom, may well be a reminiscence of a real custom.Where usages and ideas of this sort prevail, it is obvious that the kingship is merely anappanage of marriage with a woman of the blood royal. The old Danish historian SaxoPage 125"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Grammaticus puts this view of the kingship very clearly in the mouth of Hermutrude, a leg-endary queen of Scotland. “Indeed she was a queen,” says Hermutrude, “and but that her sexgainsaid it, might be deemed a king; nay (and this is yet truer), whomsoever she thought wor-thy of her bed was at once a king, and she yielded her kingdom with herself. Thus her scep-tre and her hand went together.” The statement is all the more significant because it appearsto reflect the actual practice of the Pictish kings. We know from the testimony of Bede that,whenever a doubt arose as to the succession, the Picts chose their kings from the femalerather than the male line.The personal qualities which recommended a man for a royal alliance and succession to thethrone would naturally vary according to the popular ideas of the time and the character ofthe king or his substitute, but it is reasonable to suppose that among them in early societyphysical strength and beauty would hold a prominent place.Sometimes apparently the right to the hand of the princess and to the throne has been deter-mined by a race. The Alitemnian Libyans awarded the kingdom to the fleetest runner.Amongst the old Prussians, candidates for nobility raced on horseback to the king, and theone who reached him first was ennobled. According to tradition the earliest games at Olympiawere held by Endymion, who set his sons to run a race for the kingdom. His tomb was said tobe at the point of the racecourse from which the runners started. The famous story of Pelopsand Hippodamia is perhaps only another version of the legend that the first races at Olympiawere run for no less a prize than a kingdom.These traditions may very well reflect a real custom of racing for a bride, for such a customappears to have prevailed among various peoples, though in practice it has degenerated intoa mere form or pretence. Thus “there is one race, called the ‘Love Chase,’ which may be con-sidered a part of the form of marriage among the Kirghiz. In this the bride, armed with a for-midable whip, mounts a fleet horse, and is pursued by all the young men who make any pre-tensions to her hand. She will be given as a prize to the one who catches her, but she hasthe right, besides urging on her horse to the utmost, to use her whip, often with no meanforce, to keep off those lovers who are unwelcome to her, and she will probably favour theone whom she has already chosen in her heart.” The race for the bride is found also amongthe Koryaks of North-eastern Asia. It takes place in a large tent, round which many separatecompartments called pologs are arranged in a continuous circle. The girl gets a start and isclear of the marriage if she can run through all the compartments without being caught by thebridegroom. The women of the encampment place every obstacle in the man’s way, trippinghim up, belabouring him with switches, and so forth, so that he has little chance of succeed-ing unless the girl wishes it and waits for him. Similar customs appear to have been practisedby all the Teutonic peoples; for the German, Anglo-Saxon, and Norse languages possess incommon a word for marriage which means simply bride-race. Moreover, traces of the customsurvived into modern times.Thus it appears that the right to marry a girl, and especially a princess, has often been con-ferred as a prize in an athletic contest. There would be no reason, therefore, for surprise if theRoman kings, before bestowing their daughters in marriage, should have resorted to thisancient mode of testing the personal qualities of their future sons-in-law and successors. Ifmy theory is correct, the Roman king and queen personated Jupiter and his divine consort,and in the character of these divinities went through the annual ceremony of a sacred mar-riage for the purpose of causing the crops to grow and men and cattle to be fruitful and multi-ply. Thus they did what in more northern lands we may suppose the King and Queen of MayPage 126"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"were believed to do in days of old. Now we have seen that the right to play the part of theKing of May and to wed the Queen of May has sometimes been determined by an athleticcontest, particularly by a race. This may have been a relic of an old marriage custom of thesort we have examined, a custom designed to test the fitness of a candidate for matrimony.Such a test might reasonably be applied with peculiar rigour to the king in order to ensurethat no personal defect should incapacitate him for the performance of those sacred rites andceremonies on which, even more than on the despatch of his civil and military duties, thesafety and prosperity of the community were believed to depend. And it would be natural torequire of him that from time to time he should submit himself afresh to the same ordeal forthe sake of publicly demonstrating that he was still equal to the discharge of his high calling.Arelic of that test perhaps survived in the ceremony known as the Flight of the King(regifugium), which continued to be annually observed at Rome down to imperial times. Onthe twenty-fourth day of February a sacrifice used to be offered in the Comitium, and when itwas over the King of the Sacred Rites fled from the Forum. We may conjecture that the Flightof the King was originally a race for an annual kingship, which may have been awarded as aprize to the fleetest runner. At the end of the year the king might run again for a second termof office; and so on, until he was defeated and deposed or perhaps slain. In this way whathad once been a race would tend to assume the character of a flight and a pursuit. The kingwould be given a start; he ran and his competitors ran after him, and if he were overtaken hehad to yield the crown and perhaps his life to the lightest of foot among them. In time a manof masterful character might succeed in seating himself permanently on the throne and reduc-ing the annual race or flight to the empty form which it seems always to have been within his-torical times. The rite was sometimes interpreted as a commemoration of the expulsion of thekings from Rome; but this appears to have been a mere afterthought devised to explain aceremony of which the old meaning was forgotten. It is far more likely that in acting thus theKing of the Sacred Rites was merely keeping up an ancient custom which in the regal periodhad been annually observed by his predecessors the kings. What the original intention of therite may have been must probably always remain more or less a matter of conjecture. Thepresent explanation is suggested with a full sense of the difficulty and obscurity in which thesubject is involved.Thus if my theory is correct, the yearly flight of the Roman king was a relic of a time when thekingship was an annual office awarded, along with the hand of a princess, to the victoriousathlete or gladiator, who thereafter figured along with his bride as a god and goddess at asacred marriage designed to ensure the fertility of the earth by homoeopathic magic. If I amright in supposing that in very early times the old Latin kings personated a god and were reg-ularly put to death in that character, we can better understand the mysterious or violent endsto which so many of them are said to have come. We have seen that, according to tradition,one of the kings of Alba was killed by a thunderbolt for impiously mimicking the thunder ofJupiter. Romulus is said to have vanished mysteriously like Aeneas, or to have been cut topieces by the patricians whom he had offended, and the seventh of July, the day on which heperished, was a festival which bore some resemblance to the Saturnalia. For on that day thefemale slaves were allowed to take certain remarkable liberties. They dressed up as freewomen in the attire of matrons and maids, and in this guise they went forth from the city,scoffed and jeered at all whom they met, and engaged among themselves in a fight, strikingand throwing stones at each other. Another Roman king who perished by violence was Tatius,the Sabine colleague of Romulus. It is said that he was at Lavinium offering a public sacrificeto the ancestral gods, when some men, to whom he had given umbrage, despatched him withthe sacrificial knives and spits which they had snatched from the altar. The occasion and themanner of his death suggest that the slaughter may have been a sacrifice rather than anPage 127"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"assassination. Again, Tullus Hostilius, the successor of Numa, was commonly said to havebeen killed by lightning, but many held that he was murdered at the instigation of AncusMarcius, who reigned after him. Speaking of the more or less mythical Numa, the type of thepriestly king, Plutarch observes that “his fame was enhanced by the fortunes of the laterkings. For of the five who reigned after him the last was deposed and ended his life in exile,and of the remaining four not one died a natural death; for three of them were assassinatedand Tullus Hostilius was consumed by thunderbolts.”These legends of the violent ends of the Roman kings suggest that the contest by which theygained the throne may sometimes have been a mortal combat rather than a race. If that wereso, the analogy which we have traced between Rome and Nemi would be still closer. At bothplaces the sacred kings, the living representatives of the godhead, would thus be liable to suf-fer deposition and death at the hand of any resolute man who could prove his divine right tothe holy office by the strong arm and the sharp sword. It would not be surprising if among theearly Latins the claim to the kingdom should often have been settled by single combat; fordown to historical times the Umbrians regularly submitted their private disputes to the ordealof battle, and he who cut his adversary’s throat was thought thereby to have proved the jus-tice of his cause beyond the reach of cavil.Chapter XVThe Worship of the OakTHE worship of the oak tree or of the oak god appears to have been shared by all thebranches of the Aryan stock in Europe. Both Greeks and Italians associated the tree with theirhighest god, Zeus or Jupiter, the divinity of the sky, the rain, and the thunder. Perhaps theoldest and certainly one of the most famous sanctuaries in Greece was that of Dodona,where Zeus was revered in the oracular oak. The thunder-storms which are said to rage atDodona more frequently than anywhere else in Europe, would render the spot a fitting homefor the god whose voice was heard alike in the rustling of the oak leaves and in the crash ofthunder. Perhaps the bronze gongs which kept up a humming in the wind round the sanctuarywere meant to mimick the thunder that might so often be heard rolling and rumbling in thecoombs of the stern and barren mountains which shut in the gloomy valley. In Boeotia, as wehave seen, the sacred marriage of Zeus and Hera, the oak god and the oak goddess,appears to have been celebrated with much pomp by a religious federation of states. And onMount Lycaeus in Arcadia the character of Zeus as god both of the oak and of the rain comesout clearly in the rain charm practised by the priest of Zeus, who dipped an oak branch in asacred spring. In his latter capacity Zeus was the god to whom the Greeks regularly prayedfor rain. Nothing could be more natural; for often, though not always, he had his seat on themountains where the clouds gather and the oaks grow. On the Acropolis at Athens there wasan image of Earth praying to Zeus for rain. And in time of drought the Athenians themselvesprayed, “Rain, rain, O dear Zeus, on the cornland of the Athenians and on the plains.”Again, Zeus wielded the thunder and lightning as well as the rain. At Olympia and elsewherehe was worshipped under the surname of Thunderbolt; and at Athens there was a sacrificialhearth of Lightning Zeus on the city wall, where some priestly officials watched for lightningover Mount Parnes at certain seasons of the year. Further, spots which had been struck bylightning were regularly fenced in by the Greeks and consecrated to Zeus the Descender, thatis, to the god who came down in the flash from heaven. Altars were set up within these enclo-sures and sacrifices offered on them. Several such places are known from inscriptions tohave existed in Athens.Page 128"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Thus when ancient Greek kings claimed to be descended from Zeus, and even to bear hisname, we may reasonably suppose that they also attempted to exercise his divine functionsby making thunder and rain for the good of their people or the terror and confusion of theirfoes. In this respect the legend of Salmoneus probably reflects the pretensions of a wholeclass of petty sovereigns who reigned of old, each over his little canton, in the oak-clad high-lands of Greece. Like their kinsmen the Irish kings, they were expected to be a source of fer-tility to the land and of fecundity to the cattle; and how could they fulfil these expectations bet-ter than by acting the part of their kinsman Zeus, the great god of the oak, the thunder, andthe rain? They personified him, apparently, just as the Italian kings personified Jupiter.In ancient Italy every oak was sacred to Jupiter, the Italian counterpart of Zeus; and on theCapitol at Rome the god was worshipped as the deity not merely of the oak, but of the rainand the thunder. Contrasting the piety of the good old times with the scepticism of an agewhen nobody thought that heaven was heaven, or cared a fig for Jupiter, a Roman writer tellsus that in former days noble matrons used to go with bare feet, streaming hair, and pureminds, up the long Capitoline slope, praying to Jupiter for rain. And straightway, he goes on, itrained bucketsful, then or never, and everybody returned dripping like drowned rats. “Butnowadays,” says he, “we are no longer religious, so the fields lie baking.”When we pass from Southern to Central Europe we still meet with the great god of the oakand the thunder among the barbarous Aryans who dwelt in the vast primaeval forests. Thusamong the Celts of Gaul the Druids esteemed nothing more sacred than the mistletoe andthe oak on which it grew; they chose groves of oaks for the scene of their solemn service,and they performed none of their rites without oak leaves. “The Celts,” says a Greek writer,“worship Zeus, and the Celtic image of Zeus is a tall oak.” The Celtic conquerors, who settledin Asia in the third century before our era, appear to have carried the worship of the oak withthem to their new home; for in the heart of Asia Minor the Galatian senate met in a placewhich bore the pure Celtic name of Drynemetum, “the sacred oak grove” or “the temple of theoak.” Indeed the very name of Druids is believed by good authorities to mean no more than“oak men.”In the religion of the ancient Germans the veneration for sacred groves seems to have heldthe foremost place, and according to Grimm the chief of their holy trees was the oak. Itappears to have been especially dedicated to the god of thunder, Donar or Thunar, the equiv-alent of the Norse Thor; for a sacred oak near Geismar, in Hesse, which Boniface cut down inthe eighth century, went among the heathen by the name of Jupiter’s oak (robur Jovis), whichin old German would be Donares eih, “the oak of Donar.” That the Teutonic thunder godDonar, Thunar, Thor was identified with the Italian thunder god Jupiter appears from our wordThursday, Thunar’s day, which is merely a rendering of the Latin dies Jovis. Thus among theancient Teutons, as among the Greeks and Italians, the god of the oak was also the god ofthe thunder. Moreover, he was regarded as the great fertilising power, who sent rain andcaused the earth to bear fruit; for Adam of Bremen tells us that “Thor presides in the air; he itis who rules thunder and lightning, wind and rains, fine weather and crops.” In these respects,therefore, the Teutonic thunder god again resembled his southern counterparts Zeus andJupiter.Amongst the Slavs also the oak appears to have been the sacred tree of the thunder godPerun, the counterpart of Zeus and Jupiter. It is said that at Novgorod there used to stand animage of Perun in the likeness of a man with a thunder-stone in his hand. A fire of oak woodPage 129"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"burned day and night in his honour; and if ever it went out the attendants paid for their negli-gence with their lives. Perun seems, like Zeus and Jupiter, to have been the chief god of hispeople; for Procopius tells us that the Slavs “believe that one god, the maker of lightning, isalone lord of all things, and they sacrifice to him oxen and every victim.”The chief deity of the Lithuanians was Perkunas or Perkuns, the god of thunder and lightning,whose resemblance to Zeus and Jupiter has often been pointed out. Oaks were sacred tohim, and when they were cut down by the Christian missionaries, the people loudly com-plained that their sylvan deities were destroyed. Perpetual fires, kindled with the wood of cer-tain oak-trees, were kept up in honour of Perkunas; if such a fire went out, it was lightedagain by friction of the sacred wood. Men sacrificed to oak-trees for good crops, while womendid the same to lime-trees; from which we may infer that they regarded oaks as male andlime-trees as female. And in time of drought, when they wanted rain, they used to sacrifice ablack heifer, a black he-goat, and a black cock to the thunder god in the depths of the woods.On such occasions the people assembled in great numbers from the country round about, ateand drank, and called upon Perkunas. They carried a bowl of beer thrice round the fire, thenpoured the liquor on the flames, while they prayed to the god to send showers. Thus the chiefLithuanian deity presents a close resemblance to Zeus and Jupiter, since he was the god ofthe oak, the thunder, and the rain.From the foregoing survey it appears that a god of the oak, the thunder, and the rain wasworshipped of old by all the main branches of the Aryan stock in Europe, and was indeed thechief deity of their pantheon.Chapter XVIDianus and DianaIN this chapter I propose to recapitulate the conclusions to which the enquiry has thus far ledus, and drawing together the scattered rays of light, to turn them on the dark figure of thepriest of Nemi.We have found that at an early stage of society men, ignorant of the secret processes ofnature and of the narrow limits within which it is in our power to control and direct them, havecommonly arrogated to themselves functions which in the present state of knowledge weshould deem superhuman or divine. The illusion has been fostered and maintained by thesame causes which begot it, namely, the marvellous order and uniformity with which natureconducts her operations, the wheels of her great machine revolving with a smoothness andprecision which enable the patient observer to anticipate in general the season, if not the veryhour, when they will bring round the fulfilment of his hopes or the accomplishment of hisfears. The regularly recurring events of this great cycle, or rather series of cycles, soon stampthemselves even on the dull mind of the savage. He foresees them, and foreseeing them mis-takes the desired recurrence for an effect of his own will, and the dreaded recurrence for aneffect of the will of his enemies. Thus the springs which set the vast machine in motion,though they lie far beyond our ken, shrouded in a mystery which we can never hope to pene-trate, appear to ignorant man to lie within his reach: he fancies he can touch them and sowork by magic art all manner of good to himself and evil to his foes. In time the fallacy of thisbelief becomes apparent to him: he discovers that there are things he cannot do, pleasureswhich he is unable of himself to procure, pains which even the most potent magician is pow-erless to avoid. The unattainable good, the inevitable ill, are now ascribed by him to theaction of invisible powers, whose favour is joy and life, whose anger is misery and death.Page 130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Thus magic tends to be displaced by religion, and the sorcerer by the priest. At this stage ofthought the ultimate causes of things are conceived to be personal beings, many in numberand often discordant in character, who partake of the nature and even of the frailty of man,though their might is greater than his, and their life far exceeds the span of his ephemeralexistence. Their sharply-marked individualities, their clear-cut outlines have not yet begun,under the powerful solvent of philosophy, to melt and coalesce into that single unknown sub-stratum of phenomena which, according to the qualities with which our imagination invests it,goes by one or other of the high-sounding names which the wit of man has devised to hidehis ignorance. Accordingly, so long as men look on their gods as beings akin to themselvesand not raised to an unapproachable height above them, they believe it to be possible forthose of their own number who surpass their fellows to attain to the divine rank after death oreven in life. Incarnate human deities of this latter sort may be said to halt midway betweenthe age of magic and the age of religion. If they bear the names and display the pomp ofdeities, the powers which they are supposed to wield are commonly those of their predeces-sor the magician. Like him, they are expected to guard their people against hostile enchant-ments, to heal them in sickness, to bless them with offspring, and to provide them with anabundant supply of food by regulating the weather and performing the other ceremonieswhich are deemed necessary to ensure the fertility of the earth and the multiplication of ani-mals. Men who are credited with powers so lofty and far-reaching naturally hold the highestplace in the land, and while the rift between the spiritual and the temporal spheres has not yetwidened too far, they are supreme in civil as well as religious matters: in a word, they arekings as well as gods. Thus the divinity which hedges a king has its roots deep down inhuman history, and long ages pass before these are sapped by a profounder view of natureand man.In the classical period of Greek and Latin antiquity the reign of kings was for the most part athing of the past; yet the stories of their lineage, titles, and pretensions suffice to prove thatthey too claimed to rule by divine right and to exercise superhuman powers. Hence we maywithout undue temerity assume that the King of the Wood at Nemi, though shorn in latertimes of his glory and fallen on evil days, represented a long line of sacred kings who hadonce received not only the homage but the adoration of their subjects in return for the mani-fold blessings which they were supposed to dispense. What little we know of the functions ofDiana in the Arician grove seems to prove that she was here conceived as a goddess of fertil-ity, and particularly as a divinity of childbirth. It is reasonable, therefore, to suppose that in thedischarge of these important duties she was assisted by her priest, the two figuring as Kingand Queen of the Wood in a solemn marriage, which was intended to make the earth gaywith the blossoms of spring and the fruits of autumn, and to gladden the hearts of men andwomen with healthful offspring.If the priest of Nemi posed not merely as a king, but as a god of the grove, we have still toask, What deity in particular did he personate? The answer of antiquity is that he representedVirbius, the consort or lover of Diana. But this does not help us much, for of Virbius we knowlittle more than the name. A clue to the mystery is perhaps supplied by the Vestal fire whichburned in the grove. For the perpetual holy fires of the Aryans in Europe appear to have beencommonly kindled and fed with oak-wood, and in Rome itself, not many miles from Nemi, thefuel of the Vestal fire consisted of oaken sticks or logs, as has been proved by a microscopicanalysis of the charred embers of the Vestal fire, which were discovered by CommendatoreG. Boni in the course of the memorable excavations which he conducted in the Roman forumat the end of the nineteenth century. But the ritual of the various Latin towns seems to havebeen marked by great uniformity; hence it is reasonable to conclude that wherever in LatiumPage 131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"a Vestal fire was maintained, it was fed, as at Rome, with wood of the sacred oak. If this wasso at Nemi, it becomes probable that the hallowed grove there consisted of a natural oak-wood, and that therefore the tree which the King of the Wood had to guard at the peril of hislife was itself an oak; indeed, it was from an evergreen oak, according to Virgil, that Aeneasplucked the Golden Bough. Now the oak was the sacred tree of Jupiter, the supreme god ofthe Latins. Hence it follows that the King of the Wood, whose life was bound up in a fashionwith an oak, personated no less a deity than Jupiter himself. At least the evidence, slight as itis, seems to point to this conclusion. The old Alban dynasty of the Silvii or Woods, with theircrown of oak leaves, apparently aped the style and emulated the powers of Latian Jupiter,who dwelt on the top of the Alban Mount. It is not impossible that the King of the Wood, whoguarded the sacred oak a little lower down the mountain, was the lawful successor and repre-sentative of this ancient line of the Silvii or Woods. At all events, if I am right in supposing thathe passed for a human Jupiter, it would appear that Virbius, with whom legend identified him,was nothing but a local form of Jupiter, considered perhaps in his original aspect as a god ofthe greenwood.The hypothesis that in later times at all events the King of the Wood played the part of theoak god Jupiter, is confirmed by an examination of his divine partner Diana. For two distinctlines of argument converge to show that if Diana was a queen of the woods in general, shewas at Nemi a goddess of the oak in particular. In the first place, she bore the title of Vesta,and as such presided over a perpetual fire, which we have seen reason to believe was fedwith oak wood. But a goddess of fire is not far removed from a goddess of the fuel whichburns in the fire; primitive thought perhaps drew no sharp line of distinction between the blazeand the wood that blazes. In the second place, the nymph Egeria at Nemi appears to havebeen merely a form of Diana, and Egeria is definitely said to have been a Dryad, a nymph ofthe oak. Elsewhere in Italy the goddess had her home on oak-clad mountains. Thus MountAlgidus, a spur of the Alban hills, was covered in antiquity with dark forests of oak, both of theevergreen and the deciduous sort. In winter the snow lay long on these cold hills, and theirgloomy oak-woods were believed to be a favourite haunt of Diana, as they have been of brig-ands in modern times. Again, Mount Tifata, the long abrupt ridge of the Apennines whichlooks down on the Campanian plain behind Capua, was wooded of old with evergreen oaks,among which Diana had a temple. Here Sulla thanked the goddess for his victory over theMarians in the plain below, attesting his gratitude by inscriptions which were long afterwardsto be seen in the temple. On the whole, then, we conclude that at Nemi the King of the Woodpersonated the oak-god Jupiter and mated with the oak-goddess Diana in the sacred grove.An echo of their mystic union has come down to us in the legend of the loves of Numa andEgeria, who according to some had their trysting-place in these holy woods.To this theory it may naturally be objected that the divine consort of Jupiter was not Diana butJuno, and that if Diana had a mate at all he might be expected to bear the name not ofJupiter, but of Dianus or Janus, the latter of these forms being merely a corruption of the for-mer. All this is true, but the objection may be parried by observing that the two pairs ofdeities, Jupiter and Juno on the one side, and Dianus and Diana, or Janus and Jana, on theother side, are merely duplicates of each other, their names and their functions being in sub-stance and origin identical. With regard to their names, all four of them come from the sameAryan root DI, meaning “bright,” which occurs in the names of the corresponding Greekdeities, Zeus and his old female consort Dione. In regard to their functions, Juno and Dianawere both goddesses of fecundity and childbirth, and both were sooner or later identified withthe moon. As to the true nature and functions of Janus the ancients themselves were puz-zled; and where they hesitated, it is not for us confidently to decide. But the view mentionedPage 132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"by Varro that Janus was the god of the sky is supported not only by the etymological identityof his name with that of the sky-god Jupiter, but also by the relation in which he appears tohave stood to Jupiter’s two mates, Juno and Juturna. For the epithet Junonian bestowed onJanus points to a marriage union between the two deities; and according to one accountJanus was the husband of the water-nymph Juturna, who according to others was beloved byJupiter. Moreover, Janus, like Jove, was regularly invoked, and commonly spoken of underthe title of Father. Indeed, he was identified with Jupiter not merely by the logic of the learnedSt. Augustine, but by the piety of a pagan worshipper who dedicated an offering to JupiterDianus. A trace of his relation to the oak may be found in the oakwoods of the Janiculum, thehill on the right bank of the Tiber, where Janus is said to have reigned as a king in theremotest ages of Italian history.Thus, if I am right, the same ancient pair of deities was variously known among the Greekand Italian peoples as Zeus and Dione, Jupiter and Juno, or Dianus (Janus) and Diana(Jana), the names of the divinities being identical in substance, though varying in form withthe dialect of the particular tribe which worshipped them. At first, when the peoples dwelt neareach other, the difference between the deities would be hardly more than one of name; inother words, it would be almost purely dialectical. But the gradual dispersion of the tribes, andtheir consequent isolation from each other, would favour the growth of divergent modes ofconceiving and worshipping the gods whom they had carried with them from their old home,so that in time discrepancies of myth and ritual would tend to spring up and thereby to con-vert a nominal into a real distinction between the divinities. Accordingly when, with the slowprogress of culture, the long period of barbarism and separation was passing away, and therising political power of a single strong community had begun to draw or hammer its weakerneighbours into a nation, the confluent peoples would throw their gods, like their dialects, intoa common stock; and thus it might come about that the same ancient deities, which their fore-fathers had worshipped together before the dispersion, would now be so disguised by theaccumulated effect of dialectical and religious divergencies that their original identity might failto be recognised, and they would take their places side by side as independent divinities inthe national pantheon.This duplication of deities, the result of the final fusion of kindred tribes who had long livedapart, would account for the appearance of Janus beside Jupiter, and of Diana or Janabeside Juno in the Roman religion. At least this appears to be a more probable theory thanthe opinion, which has found favour with some modern scholars, that Janus was originallynothing but the god of doors. That a deity of his dignity and importance, whom the Romansrevered as a god of gods and the father of his people, should have started in life as a hum-ble, though doubtless respectable, doorkeeper appears very unlikely. So lofty an end hardlyconsorts with so lowly a beginning. It is more probable that the door (janua) got its name fromJanus than that he got his name from it. This view is strengthened by a consideration of theword janua itself. The regular word for door is the same in all the languages of the Aryan fam-ily from India to Ireland. It is dur in Sanscrit, thura in Greek, tür in German, door in English,dorus in old Irish, and foris in Latin. Yet besides this ordinary name for door, which the Latinsshared with all their Aryan brethren, they had also the name janua, to which there is no corre-sponding term in any Indo-European speech. The word has the appearance of being anadjectival form derived from the noun Janus. I conjecture that it may have been customary toset up an image or symbol of Janus at the principal door of the house in order to place theentrance under the protection of the great god. A door thus guarded might be known as ajanua foris, that is, a Januan door, and the phrase might in time be abridged into janua, thenoun foris being understood but not expressed. From this to the use of janua to designate aPage 133"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"door in general, whether guarded by an image of Janus or not, would be an easy and naturaltransition.If there is any truth in this conjecture, it may explain very simply the origin of the double headof Janus, which has so long exercised the ingenuity of mythologists. When it had becomecustomary to guard the entrance of houses and towns by an image of Janus, it might well bedeemed necessary to make the sentinel god look both ways, before and behind, at the sametime, in order that nothing should escape his vigilant eye. For if the divine watchman alwaysfaced in one direction, it is easy to imagine what mischief might have been wrought withimpunity behind his back. This explanation of the double-headed Janus at Rome is confirmedby the double-headed idol which the Bush negroes in the interior of Surinam regularly set upas a guardian at the entrance of a village. The idol consists of a block of wood with a humanface rudely carved on each side; it stands under a gateway composed of two uprights and across-bar. Beside the idol generally lies a white rag intended to keep off the devil; and some-times there is also a stick which seems to represent a bludgeon or weapon of some sort.Further, from the cross-bar hangs a small log which serves the useful purpose of knocking onthe head any evil spirit who might attempt to pass through the gateway. Clearly this double-headed fetish at the gateway of the negro villages in Surinam bears a close resemblance tothe double-headed images of Janus which, grasping a stick in one hand and a key in theother, stood sentinel at Roman gates and doorways; and we can hardly doubt that in bothcases the heads facing two ways are to be similarly explained as expressive of the vigilanceof the guardian god, who kept his eye on spiritual foes behind and before, and stood ready tobludgeon them on the spot. We may, therefore, dispense with the tedious and unsatisfactoryexplanations which, if we may trust Ovid, the wily Janus himself fobbed off an anxious Romanenquirer.To apply these conclusions to the priest of Nemi, we may suppose that as the mate of Dianahe represented originally Dianus or Janus rather than Jupiter, but that the difference betweenthese deities was of old merely superficial, going little deeper than the names, and leavingpractically unaffected the essential functions of the god as a power of the sky, the thunder,and the oak. It was fitting, therefore, that his human representative at Nemi should dwell, aswe have seen reason to believe he did, in an oak grove. His title of King of the Wood clearlyindicates the sylvan character of the deity whom he served; and since he could only beassailed by him who had plucked the bough of a certain tree in the grove, his own life mightbe said to be bound up with that of the sacred tree. Thus he not only served but embodiedthe great Aryan god of the oak; and as an oak-god he would mate with the oak-goddess,whether she went by the name of Egeria or Diana. Their union, however consummated,would be deemed essential to the fertility of the earth and the fecundity of man and beast.Further, as the oak-god was also a god of the sky, the thunder, and the rain, so his humanrepresentative would be required, like many other divine kings, to cause the clouds to gather,the thunder to peal, and the rain to descend in due season, that the fields and orchards mightbear fruit and the pastures be covered with luxuriant herbage. The reputed possessor of pow-ers so exalted must have been a very important personage; and the remains of buildings andof votive offerings which have been found on the site of the sanctuary combine with the testi-mony of classical writers to prove that in later times it was one of the greatest and most popu-lar shrines in Italy. Even in the old days, when the champaign country around was still par-celled out among the petty tribes who composed the Latin League, the sacred grove is knownto have been an object of their common reverence and care. And just as the kings ofCambodia used to send offerings to the mystic kings of Fire and Water far in the dim depthsof the tropical forest, so, we may well believe, from all sides of the broad Latian plain thePage 134"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"eyes and footsteps of Italian pilgrims turned to the quarter where, standing sharply outagainst the faint blue line of the Apennines or the deeper blue of the distant sea, the AlbanMountain rose before them, the home of the mysterious priest of Nemi, the King of the Wood.There, among the green woods and beside the still waters of the lonely hills, the ancientAryan worship of the god of the oak, the thunder, and the dripping sky lingered in its early,almost Druidical form, long after a great political and intellectual revolution had shifted thecapital of Latin religion from the forest to the city, from Nemi to Rome.Chapter XVIIThe Burden of Royalty1. ROYAL AND PRIESTLY TABOOSATa certain stage of early society the king or priest is often thought to be endowed withsupernatural powers or to be an incarnation of a deity, and consistently with this belief thecourse of nature is supposed to be more or less under his control, and he is held responsiblefor bad weather, failure of the crops, and similar calamities. To some extent it appears to beassumed that the king’s power over nature, like that over his subjects and slaves, is exertedthrough definite acts of will; and therefore if drought, famine, pestilence, or storms arise, thepeople attribute the misfortune to the negligence or guilt of their king, and punish him accord-ingly with stripes and bonds, or, if he remains obdurate, with deposition and death.Sometimes, however, the course of nature, while regarded as dependent on the king, is sup-posed to be partly independent of his will. His person is considered, if we may express it so,as the dynamical centre of the universe, from which lines of force radiate to all quarters of theheaven; so that any motion of his—the turning of his head, the lifting of his hand—instanta-neously affects and may seriously disturb some part of nature. He is the point of support onwhich hangs the balance of the world, and the slightest irregularity on his part may overthrowthe delicate equipoise. The greatest care must, therefore, be taken both by and of him; andhis whole life, down to its minutest details, must be so regulated that no act of his, voluntaryor involuntary, may disarrange or upset the established order of nature. Of this class of mon-archs the Mikado or Dairi, the spiritual emperor of Japan, is or rather used to be a typicalexample. He is an incarnation of the sun goddess, the deity who rules the universe, gods andmen included; once a year all the gods wait upon him and spend a month at his court. Duringthat month, the name of which means “without gods,” no one frequents the temples, for theyare believed to be deserted. The Mikado receives from his people and assumes in his officialproclamations and decrees the title of “manifest or incarnate deity,” and he claims a generalauthority over the gods of Japan. For example, in an official decree of the year 646 theemperor is described as “the incarnate god who governs the universe.”The following description of the Mikado’s mode of life was written about two hundred yearsago:“Even to this day the princes descended of this family, more particularly those who sit on thethrone, are looked upon as persons most holy in themselves, and as Popes by birth. And, inorder to preserve these advantageous notions in the minds of their subjects, they are obligedto take an uncommon care of their sacred persons, and to do such things, which, examinedaccording to the customs of other nations, would be thought ridiculous and impertinent. It willnot be improper to give a few instances of it. He thinks that it would be very prejudicial to hisdignity and holiness to touch the ground with his feet; for this reason, when he intends to goanywhere, he must be carried thither on men’s shoulders. Much less will they suffer that hePage 135"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"should expose his sacred person to the open air, and the sun is not thought worthy to shineon his head. There is such a holiness ascribed to all the parts of his body that he dares to cutoff neither his hair, nor his beard, nor his nails. However, lest he should grow too dirty, theymay clean him in the night when he is asleep; because, they say, that which is taken from hisbody at that time, hath been stolen from him, and that such a theft doth not prejudice his holi-ness or dignity. In ancient times, he was obliged to sit on the throne for some hours everymorning, with the imperial crown on his head, but to sit altogether like a statue, without stir-ring either hands or feet, head or eyes, nor indeed any part of his body, because, by thismeans, it was thought that he could preserve peace and tranquillity in his empire; for if, unfor-tunately, he turned himself on one side or the other, or if he looked a good while towards anypart of his dominions, it was apprehended that war, famine, fire, or some other great misfor-tune was near at hand to desolate the country. But it having been afterwards discovered, thatthe imperial crown was the palladium, which by its immobility could preserve peace in theempire, it was thought expedient to deliver his imperial person, consecrated only to idlenessand pleasures, from this burthensome duty, and therefore the crown is at present placed onthe throne for some hours every morning. His victuals must be dressed every time in newpots, and served at table in new dishes: both are very clean and neat, but made only of com-mon clay; that without any considerable expense they may be laid aside, or broke, after theyhave served once. They are generally broke, for fear they should come into the hands of lay-men, for they believe religiously, that if any layman should presume to eat his food out ofthese sacred dishes, it would swell and inflame his mouth and throat. The like ill effect isdreaded from the Dairi’s sacred habits; for they believe that if a layman should wear them,without the Emperor’s express leave or command, they would occasion swellings and painsin all parts of his body.” To the same effect an earlier account of the Mikado says: “It was con-sidered as a shameful degradation for him even to touch the ground with his foot. The sunand moon were not even permitted to shine upon his head. None of the superfluities of thebody were ever taken from him, neither his hair, his beard, nor his nails were cut. Whateverhe eat was dressed in new vessels.”Similar priestly or rather divine kings are found, at a lower level of barbarism, on the westcoast of Africa. At Shark Point near Cape Padron, in Lower Guinea, lives the priestly kingKukulu, alone in a wood. He may not touch a woman nor leave his house; indeed he may noteven quit his chair, in which he is obliged to sleep sitting, for if he lay down no wind wouldarise and navigation would be stopped. He regulates storms, and in general maintains awholesome and equable state of the atmosphere. On Mount Agu in Togo there lives a fetishor spirit called Bagba, who is of great importance for the whole of the surrounding country.The power of giving or withholding rain is ascribed to him, and he is lord of the winds, includ-ing the Harmattan, the dry, hot wind which blows from the interior. His priest dwells in a houseon the highest peak of the mountain, where he keeps the winds bottled up in huge jars.Applications for rain, too, are made to him, and he does a good business in amulets, whichconsist of the teeth and claws of leopards. Yet though his power is great and he is indeed thereal chief of the land, the rule of the fetish forbids him ever to leave the mountain, and hemust spend the whole of his life on its summit. Only once a year may he come down to makepurchases in the market; but even then he may not set foot in the hut of any mortal man, andmust return to his place of exile the same day. The business of government in the villages isconducted by subordinate chiefs, who are appointed by him. In the West African kingdom ofCongo there was a supreme pontiff called Chitomé or Chitombé, whom the negroes regardedas a god on earth and all-powerful in heaven. Hence before they would taste the new cropsthey offered him the first-fruits, fearing that manifold misfortunes would befall them if theybroke this rule. When he left his residence to visit other places within his jurisdiction, all mar-Page 136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"ried people had to observe strict continence the whole time he was out; for it was supposedthat any act of incontinence would prove fatal to him. And if he were to die a natural death,they thought that the world would perish, and the earth, which he alone sustained by hispower and merit, would immediately be annihilated. Amongst the semi-barbarous nations ofthe New World, at the date of the Spanish conquest, there were found hierarchies or theocra-cies like those of Japan; in particular, the high pontiff of the Zapotecs appears to have pre-sented a close parallel to the Mikado. A powerful rival to the king himself, this spiritual lordgoverned Yopaa, one of the chief cities of the kingdom, with absolute dominion. It is impossi-ble, we are told, to overrate the reverence in which he was held. He was looked on as a godwhom the earth was not worthy to hold nor the sun to shine upon. He profaned his sanctity ifhe even touched the ground with his foot. The officers who bore his palanquin on their shoul-ders were members of the highest families: he hardly deigned to look on anything aroundhim; and all who met him fell with their faces to the earth, fearing that death would overtakethem if they saw even his shadow. A rule of continence was regularly imposed on the Zapotecpriests, especially upon the high pontiff; but “on certain days in each year, which were gener-ally celebrated with feasts and dances, it was customary for the high priest to become drunk.While in this state, seeming to belong neither to heaven nor to earth, one of the most beauti-ful of the virgins consecrated to the service of the gods was brought to him.” If the child shebore him was a son, he was brought up as a prince of the blood, and the eldest son succeed-ed his father on the pontifical throne. The supernatural powers attributed to this pontiff are notspecified, but probably they resembled those of the Mikado and Chitomé.Wherever, as in Japan and West Africa, it is supposed that the order of nature, and even theexistence of the world, is bound up with the life of the king or priest, it is clear that he must beregarded by his subjects as a source both of infinite blessing and of infinite danger. On theone hand, the people have to thank him for the rain and sunshine which foster the fruits ofthe earth, for the wind which brings ships to their coasts, and even for the solid groundbeneath their feet. But what he gives he can refuse; and so close is the dependence ofnature on his person, so delicate the balance of the system of forces whereof he is the cen-tre, that the least irregularity on his part may set up a tremor which shall shake the earth to itsfoundations. And if nature may be disturbed by the slightest involuntary act of the king, it iseasy to conceive the convulsion which his death might provoke. The natural death of theChitomé, as we have seen, was thought to entail the destruction of all things. Clearly, there-fore, out of a regard for their own safety, which might be imperilled by any rash act of theking, and still more by his death, the people will exact of their king or priest a strict conformityto those rules, the observance of which is deemed necessary for his own preservation, andconsequently for the preservation of his people and the world. The idea that early kingdomsare despotisms in which the people exist only for the sovereign, is wholly inapplicable to themonarchies we are considering. On the contrary, the sovereign in them exists only for hissubjects; his life is only valuable so long as he discharges the duties of his position by order-ing the course of nature for his people’s benefit. So soon as he fails to do so, the care, thedevotion, the religious homage which they had hitherto lavished on him cease and arechanged into hatred and contempt; he is dismissed ignominiously, and may be thankful if heescapes with his life. Worshipped as a god one day, he is killed as a criminal the next. But inthis changed behaviour of the people there is nothing capricious or inconsistent. On the con-trary, their conduct is entirely of a piece. If their king is their god, he is or should be also theirpreserver; and if he will not preserve them, he must make room for another who will. So long,however, as he answers their expectations, there is no limit to the care which they take ofhim, and which they compel him to take of himself. A king of this sort lives hedged in by aceremonious etiquette, a network of prohibitions and observances, of which the intention isPage 137"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"not to contribute to his dignity, much less to his comfort, but to restrain him from conductwhich, by disturbing the harmony of nature, might involve himself, his people, and the uni-verse in one common catastrophe. Far from adding to his comfort, these observances, bytrammelling his every act, annihilate his freedom and often render the very life, which it istheir object to preserve, a burden and sorrow to him.Of the supernaturally endowed kings of Loango it is said that the more powerful a king is, themore taboos is he bound to observe; they regulate all his actions, his walking and his stand-ing, his eating and drinking, his sleeping and waking. To these restraints the heir to the throneis subject from infancy; but as he advances in life the number of abstinences and ceremonieswhich he must observe increases, “until at the moment that he ascends the throne he is lostin the ocean of rites and taboos.” In the crater of an extinct volcano, enclosed on all sides bygrassy slopes, lie the scattered huts and yam-fields of Riabba, the capital of the native king ofFernando Po. This mysterious being lives in the lowest depths of the crater, surrounded by aharem of forty women, and covered, it is said, with old silver coins. Naked savage as he is,he yet exercises far more influence in the island than the Spanish governor at Santa Isabel.In him the conservative spirit of the Boobies or aboriginal inhabitants of the island is, as itwere, incorporate. He has never seen a white man and, according to the firm conviction of allthe Boobies, the sight of a pale face would cause his instant death. He cannot bear to lookupon the sea; indeed it is said that he may never see it even in the distance, and that there-fore he wears away his life with shackles on his legs in the dim twilight of his hut. Certain it isthat he has never set foot on the beach. With the exception of his musket and knife, he usesnothing that comes from the whites; European cloth never touches his person, and he scornstobacco, rum, and even salt.Among the Ewe-speaking peoples of the Slave Coast “the king is at the same time highpriest. In this quality he was, particularly in former times, unapproachable by his subjects.Only by night was he allowed to quit his dwelling in order to bathe and so forth. None but hisrepresentative, the so-called ‘visible king,’ with three chosen elders might converse with him,and even they had to sit on an ox-hide with their backs turned to him. He might not see anyEuropean nor any horse, nor might he look upon the sea, for which reason he was notallowed to quit his capital even for a few moments. These rules have been disregarded inrecent times.” The king of Dahomey himself is subject to the prohibition of beholding the sea,and so are the kings of Loango and Great Ardra in Guinea. The sea is the fetish of the Eyeos,to the north-west of Dahomey, and they and their king are threatened with death by theirpriests if ever they dare to look on it. It is believed that the king of Cayor in Senegal wouldinfallibly die within the year if he were to cross a river or an arm of the sea. In Mashonalanddown to recent times the chiefs would not cross certain rivers, particularly the Rurikwi and theNyadiri; and the custom was still strictly observed by at least one chief within recent years.“On no account will the chief cross the river. If it is absolutely necessary for him to do so, heis blindfolded and carried across with shouting and singing. Should he walk across, he will goblind or die and certainly lose the chieftainship.” So among the Mahafalys and Sakalavas inthe south of Madagascar some kings are forbidden to sail on the sea or to cross certainrivers. Among the Sakalavas the chief is regarded as a sacred being, but “he is held in leashby a crowd of restrictions, which regulate his behaviour like that of the emperor of China. Hecan undertake nothing whatever unless the sorcerers have declared the omens favourable;he may not eat warm food: on certain days he may not quit his hut; and so on.” Among someof the hill tribes of Assam both the headman and his wife have to observe many taboos inrespect of food; thus they may not eat buffalo, pork, dog, fowl, or tomatoes. The headmanmust be chaste, the husband of one wife, and he must separate himself from her on the evePage 138"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"of a general or public observance of taboo. In one group of tribes the headman is forbidden toeat in a strange village, and under no provocation whatever may he utter a word of abuse.Apparently the people imagine that the violation of any of these taboos by a headman wouldbring down misfortune on the whole village.The ancient kings of Ireland, as well as the kings of the four provinces of Leinster, Munster,Connaught, and Ulster, were subject to certain quaint prohibitions or taboos, on the dueobservance of which the prosperity of the people of the country, as well as their own, wassupposed to depend. Thus, for example, the sun might not rise on the king of Ireland in hisbed at Tara, the old capital of Erin; he was forbidden to alight on Wednesday at MaghBreagh, to traverse Magh Cuillinn after sunset, to incite his horse at Fan-Chomair, to go in aship upon the water the Monday after Bealltaine (May day), and to leave the track of his armyupon Ath Maighne the Tuesday after All-Hallows. The king of Leinster might not go roundTuath Laighean left-hand-wise on Wednesday, nor sleep between the Dothair (Dodder) andthe Duibhlinn with his head inclining to one side, nor encamp for nine days on the plains ofCualann, nor travel the road of Duibhlinn on Monday, nor ride a dirty black-heeled horseacross Magh Maistean. The king of Munster was prohibited from enjoying the feast of LochLein from one Monday to another; from banqueting by night in the beginning of harvest beforeGeim at Leitreacha; from encamping for nine days upon the Siuir; and from holding a bordermeeting at Gabhran. The king of Connaught might not conclude a treaty respecting hisancient palace of Cruachan after making peace on All-Hallows Day, nor go in a speckled gar-ment on a grey speckled steed to the heath of Dal Chais, nor repair to an assembly ofwomen at Seaghais, nor sit in autumn on the sepulchral mounds of the wife of Maine, norcontend in running with the rider of a grey one-eyed horse at Ath Gallta between two posts.The king of Ulster was forbidden to attend the horse fair at Rath Line among the youths ofDal Araidhe, to listen to the fluttering of the flocks of birds of Linn Saileach after sunset, tocelebrate the feast of the bull of Daire-mic-Daire, to go into Magh Cobha in the month ofMarch, and to drink of the water of Bo Neimhidh between two darknesses. If the kings ofIreland strictly observed these and many other customs, which were enjoined by immemorialusage, it was believed that they would never meet with mischance or misfortune, and wouldlive for ninety years without experiencing the decay of old age; that no epidemic or mortalitywould occur during their reigns; and that the seasons would be favourable and the earth yieldits fruit in abundance; whereas, if they set the ancient usages at naught, the country would bevisited with plague, famine, and bad weather.The kings of Egypt were worshipped as gods, and the routine of their daily life was regulatedin every detail by precise and unvarying rules. “The life of the kings of Egypt,” says Diodorus,“was not like that of other monarchs who are irresponsible and may do just what they choose;on the contrary, everything was fixed for them by law, not only their official duties, but eventhe details of their daily life.... The hours both of day and night were arranged at which theking had to do, not what he pleased, but what was prescribed for him.... For not only were thetimes appointed at which he should transact public business or sit in judgment; but the veryhours for his walking and bathing and sleeping with his wife, and, in short, performing everyact of life were all settled. Custom enjoined a simple diet; the only flesh he might eat was vealand goose, and he might only drink a prescribed quantity of wine.” However, there is reasonto think that these rules were observed, not by the ancient Pharaohs, but by the priestly kingswho reigned at Thebes and Ethiopia at the close of the twentieth dynasty.Of the taboos imposed on priests we may see a striking example in the rules of life pre-scribed for the Flamen Dialis at Rome, who has been interpreted as a living image of Jupiter,Page 139"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"or a human embodiment of the sky-spirit. They were such as the following: The Flamen Dialismight not ride or even touch a horse, nor see an army under arms, nor wear a ring which wasnot broken, nor have a knot on any part of his garments; no fire except a sacred fire might betaken out of his house; he might not touch wheaten flour or leavened bread; he might nottouch or even name a goat, a dog, raw meat, beans, and ivy; he might not walk under a vine;the feet of his bed had to be daubed with mud; his hair could be cut only by a free man andwith a bronze knife and his hair and nails when cut had to be buried under a lucky tree; hemight not touch a dead body nor enter a place where one was burned; he might not see workbeing done on holy days; he might not be uncovered in the open air; if a man in bonds weretaken into his house, the captive had to be unbound and the cords had to be drawn upthrough a hole in the roof and so let down into the street. His wife, the Flaminica, had toobserve nearly the same rules, and others of her own besides. She might not ascend morethan three steps of the kind of staircase called Greek; at a certain festival she might not combher hair; the leather of her shoes might not be made from a beast that had died a naturaldeath, but only from one that had been slain or sacrificed; if she heard thunder she wastabooed till she had offered an expiatory sacrifice.Among the Grebo people of Sierra Leone there is a pontiff who bears the title of Bodia andhas been compared, on somewhat slender grounds, to the high priest of the Jews. He isappointed in accordance with the behest of an oracle. At an elaborate ceremony of installa-tion he is anointed, a ring is put on his ankle as a badge of office, and the door-posts of hishouse are sprinkled with the blood of a sacrificed goat. He has charge of the public talismansand idols, which he feeds with rice and oil every new moon; and he sacrifices on behalf of thetown to the dead and to demons. Nominally his power is very great, but in practice it is verylimited; for he dare not defy public opinion, and he is held responsible, even with his life, forany adversity that befalls the country. It is expected of him that he should cause the earth tobring forth abundantly, the people to be healthy, war to be driven far away, and witchcraft tobe kept in abeyance. His life is trammelled by the observance of certain restrictions or taboos.Thus he may not sleep in any house but his own official residence, which is called the“anointed house” with reference to the ceremony of anointing him at inauguration. He may notdrink water on the highway. He may not eat while a corpse is in the town, and he may notmourn for the dead. If he dies while in office, he must be buried at dead of night; few mayhear of his burial, and none may mourn for him when his death is made public. Should hehave fallen a victim to the poison ordeal by drinking a decoction of sassywood, as it is called,he must be buried under a running stream of water.Among the Todas of Southern India the holy milkman, who acts as priest of the sacred dairy,is subject to a variety of irksome and burdensome restrictions during the whole time of hisincumbency, which may last many years. Thus he must live at the sacred dairy and maynever visit his home or any ordinary village. He must be celibate; if he is married he mustleave his wife. On no account may any ordinary person touch the holy milkman or the holydairy; such a touch would so defile his holiness that he would forfeit his office. It is only ontwo days a week, namely Mondays and Thursdays, that a mere layman may even approachthe milkman; on other days if he has any business with him, he must stand at a distance(some say a quarter of a mile) and shout his message across the intervening space. Further,the holy milkman never cuts his hair or pares his nails so long as he holds office; he nevercrosses a river by a bridge, but wades through a ford and only certain fords; if a death occursin his clan, he may not attend any of the funeral ceremonies, unless he first resigns his officeand descends from the exalted rank of milkman to that of a mere common mortal. Indeed itappears that in old days he had to resign the seals, or rather the pails, of office whenever anyPage 140"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"member of his clan departed this life. However, these heavy restraints are laid in their entiretyonly on milkmen of the very highest class.2. DIVORCE OF THE SPIRITUAL FROM THE TEMPORAL POWERThe burdensome observances attached to the royal or priestly office produced their naturaleffect. Either men refused to accept the office, which hence tended to fall into abeyance; oraccepting it, they sank under its weight into spiritless creatures, cloistered recluses, fromwhose nerveless fingers the reins of government slipped into the firmer grasp of men whowere often content to wield the reality of sovereignty without its name. In some countries thisrift in the supreme power deepened into a total and permanent separation of the spiritual andtemporal powers, the old royal house retaining their purely religious functions, while the civilgovernment passed into the hands of a younger and more vigorous race.To take examples. In a previous part of this work we saw that in Cambodia it is often neces-sary to force the kingships of Fire and Water upon the reluctant successors, and that inSavage Island the monarchy actually came to an end because at last no one could beinduced to accept the dangerous distinction. In some parts of West Africa, when the king dies,a family council is secretly held to determine his successor. He on whom the choice falls issuddenly seized, bound, and thrown into the fetish-house, where he is kept in durance till heconsents to accept the crown. Sometimes the heir finds means of evading the honour which itis sought to thrust upon him; a ferocious chief has been known to go about constantly armed,resolute to resist by force any attempt to set him on the throne. The savage Timmes of SierraLeone, who elect their king, reserve to themselves the right of beating him on the eve of hiscoronation; and they avail themselves of this constitutional privilege with such hearty goodwillthat sometimes the unhappy monarch does not long survive his elevation to the throne.Hence when the leading chiefs have a spite at a man and wish to rid themselves of him, theyelect him king. Formerly, before a man was proclaimed king of Sierra Leone, it used to be thecustom to load him with chains and thrash him. Then the fetters were knocked off, the kinglyrobe was placed on him, and he received in his hands the symbol of royal dignity, which wasnothing but the axe of the executioner. It is not therefore surprising to read that in SierraLeone, where such customs have prevailed, “except among the Mandingoes and Suzees, fewkings are natives of the countries they govern. So different are their ideas from ours, that veryfew are solicitous of the honour, and competition is very seldom heard of.”The Mikados of Japan seem early to have resorted to the expedient of transferring the hon-ours and burdens of supreme power to their infant children; and the rise of the Tycoons, longthe temporal sovereigns of the country, is traced to the abdication of a certain Mikado infavour of his three-year-old son. The sovereignty having been wrested by a usurper from theinfant prince, the cause of the Mikado was championed by Yoritomo, a man of spirit and con-duct, who overthrew the usurper and restored to the Mikado the shadow, while he retained forhimself the substance, of power. He bequeathed to his descendants the dignity he had won,and thus became the founder of the line of Tycoons. Down to the latter half of the sixteenthcentury the Tycoons were active and efficient rulers; but the same fate overtook them whichhad befallen the Mikados. Immeshed in the same inextricable web of custom and law, theydegenerated into mere puppets, hardly stirring from their palaces and occupied in a perpetualround of empty ceremonies, while the real business of government was managed by thecouncil of state. In Tonquin the monarchy ran a similar course. Living like his predecessors ineffeminacy and sloth, the king was driven from the throne by an ambitious adventurer namedMack, who from a fisherman had risen to be Grand Mandarin. But the king’s brother Tring putPage 141"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"down the usurper and restored the king, retaining, however, for himself and his descendantsthe dignity of general of all the forces. Thenceforward the kings, though invested with the titleand pomp of sovereignty, ceased to govern. While they lived secluded in their palaces, allreal political power was wielded by the hereditary generals.In Mangaia, a Polynesian island, religious and civil authority were lodged in separate hands,spiritual functions being discharged by a line of hereditary kings, while the temporal govern-ment was entrusted from time to time to a victorious war-chief, whose investiture, however,had to be completed by the king. Similarly in Tonga, besides the civil king whose right to thethrone was partly hereditary and partly derived from his warlike reputation and the number ofhis fighting men, there was a great divine chief who ranked above the king and the otherchiefs in virtue of his supposed descent from one of the chief gods. Once a year the first-fruitsof the ground were offered to him at a solemn ceremony, and it was believed that if theseofferings were not made the vengeance of the gods would fall in a signal manner on the peo-ple. Peculiar forms of speech, such as were applied to no one else, were used in speaking ofhim, and everything that he chanced to touch became sacred or tabooed. When he and theking met, the monarch had to sit down on the ground in token of respect until his holinesshad passed by. Yet though he enjoyed the highest veneration by reason of his divine origin,this sacred personage possessed no political authority, and if he ventured to meddle withaffairs of state it was at the risk of receiving a rebuff from the king, to whom the real powerbelonged, and who finally succeeded in ridding himself of his spiritual rival.In some parts of Western Africa two kings reign side by side, a fetish or religious king and acivil king, but the fetish king is really supreme. He controls the weather and so forth, and canput a stop to everything. When he lays his red staff on the ground, no one may pass that way.This division of power between a sacred and a secular ruler is to be met with wherever thetrue negro culture has been left unmolested, but where the negro form of society has beendisturbed, as in Dahomey and Ashantee, there is a tendency to consolidate the two powers ina single king.In some parts of the East Indian island of Timor we meet with a partition of power like thatwhich is represented by the civil king and the fetish king of Western Africa. Some of theTimorese tribes recognise two rajahs, the ordinary or civil rajah, who governs the people, andthe fetish or taboo rajah, who is charged with the control of everything that concerns the earthand its products. This latter ruler has the right of declaring anything taboo; his permissionmust be obtained before new land may be brought under cultivation, and he must performcertain necessary ceremonies when the work is being carried out. If drought or blight threat-ens the crops, his help is invoked to save them. Though he ranks below the civil rajah, heexercises a momentous influence on the course of events, for his secular colleague is boundto consult him in all important matters. In some of the neighbouring islands, such as Rotti andeastern Flores, a spiritual ruler of the same sort is recognised under various native names,which all mean “lord of the ground.” Similarly in the Mekeo district of British New Guineathere is a double chieftainship. The people are divided into two groups according to families,and each of the groups has its chief. One of the two is the war chief, the other is the taboochief. The office of the latter is hereditary; his duty is to impose a taboo on any of the crops,such as the coco-nuts and areca nuts, whenever he thinks it desirable to prohibit their use. Inhis office we may perhaps detect the beginning of a priestly dynasty, but as yet his functionsappear to be more magical than religious, being concerned with the control of the harvestsrather than with the propitiation of higher powers.Page 142"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Chapter XVIIIThe Perils of the Soul1. THE SOUL AS A MANNIKINTHE foregoing examples have taught us that the office of a sacred king or priest is oftenhedged in by a series of burdensome restrictions or taboos, of which a principal purposeappears to be to preserve the life of the divine man for the good of his people. But if theobject of the taboos is to save his life, the question arises, How is their observance supposedto effect this end? To understand this we must know the nature of the danger which threatensthe king’s life, and which it is the intention of these curious restrictions to guard against. Wemust, therefore, ask: What does early man understand by death? To what causes does heattribute it? And how does he think it may be guarded against?As the savage commonly explains the processes of inanimate nature by supposing that theyare produced by living beings working in or behind the phenomena, so he explains the phe-nomena of life itself. If an animal lives and moves, it can only be, he thinks, because there isa little animal inside which moves it: if a man lives and moves, it can only be because he hasa little man or animal inside who moves him. The animal inside the animal, the man inside theman, is the soul. And as the activity of an animal or man is explained by the presence of thesoul, so the repose of sleep or death is explained by its absence; sleep or trance being thetemporary, death being the permanent absence of the soul. Hence if death be the permanentabsence of the soul, the way to guard against it is either to prevent the soul from leaving thebody, or, if it does depart, to ensure that it shall return. The precautions adopted by savagesto secure one or other of these ends take the form of certain prohibitions or taboos, which arenothing but rules intended to ensure either the continued presence or the return of the soul.In short, they are life-preservers or life-guards. These general statements will now be illustrat-ed by examples.Addressing some Australian blacks, a European missionary said, “I am not one, as you think,but two.” Upon this they laughed. “You may laugh as much as you like,” continued the mis-sionary, “I tell you that I am two in one; this great body that you see is one; within that there isanother little one which is not visible. The great body dies, and is buried, but the little bodyflies away when the great one dies.” To this some of the blacks replied, “Yes, yes. We alsoare two, we also have a little body within the breast.” On being asked where the little bodywent after death, some said it went behind the bush, others said it went into the sea, andsome said they did not know. The Hurons thought that the soul had a head and body, armsand legs; in short, that it was a complete little model of the man himself. The Esquimauxbelieve that “the soul exhibits the same shape as the body it belongs to, but is of a more sub-tle and ethereal nature.” According to the Nootkas the soul has the shape of a tiny man; itsseat is the crown of the head. So long as it stands erect, its owner is hale and hearty; butwhen from any cause it loses its upright position, he loses his senses. Among the Indiantribes of the Lower Fraser River, man is held to have four souls, of which the principal onehas the form of a mannikin, while the other three are shadows of it. The Malays conceive thehuman soul as a little man, mostly invisible and of the bigness of a thumb, who correspondsexactly in shape, proportion, and even in complexion to the man in whose body he resides.This mannikin is of a thin, unsubstantial nature, though not so impalpable but that it maycause displacement on entering a physical object, and it can flit quickly from place to place; itis temporarily absent from the body in sleep, trance, and disease, and permanently absentPage 143"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"after death.So exact is the resemblance of the mannikin to the man, in other words, of the soul to thebody, that, as there are fat bodies and thin bodies, so there are fat souls and thin souls; asthere are heavy bodies and light bodies, long bodies and short bodies, so there are heavysouls and light souls, long souls and short souls. The people of Nias think that every man,before he is born, is asked how long or how heavy a soul he would like, and a soul of thedesired weight or length is measured out to him. The heaviest soul ever given out weighsabout ten grammes. The length of a man’s life is proportioned to the length of his soul; chil-dren who die young had short souls. The Fijian conception of the soul as a tiny human beingcomes clearly out in the customs observed at the death of a chief among the Nakelo tribe.When a chief dies, certain men, who are the hereditary undertakers, call him, as he lies, oiledand ornamented, on fine mats, saying, “Rise, sir, the chief, and let us be going. The day hascome over the land.” Then they conduct him to the river side, where the ghostly ferrymancomes to ferry Nakelo ghosts across the stream. As they thus attend the chief on his last jour-ney, they hold their great fans close to the ground to shelter him, because, as one of themexplained to a missionary, “His soul is only a little child.” People in the Punjaub who tattoothemselves believe that at death the soul, “the little entire man or woman” inside the mortalframe, will go to heaven blazoned with the same tattoo patterns which adorned the body inlife. Sometimes, however, as we shall see, the human soul is conceived not in human but inanimal form.2. ABSENCE AND RECALL OF THE SOULThe soul is commonly supposed to escape by the natural openings of the body, especially themouth and nostrils. Hence in Celebes they sometimes fasten fish-hooks to a sick man’s nose,navel, and feet, so that if his soul should try to escape it may be hooked and held fast. A Turikon the Baram River, in Borneo, refused to part with some hook-like stones, because they, asit were, hooked his soul to his body, and so prevented the spiritual portion of him frombecoming detached from the material. When a Sea Dyak sorcerer or medicine-man is initiat-ed, his fingers are supposed to be furnished with fish-hooks, with which he will thereafterclutch the human soul in the act of flying away, and restore it to the body of the sufferer. Buthooks, it is plain, may be used to catch the souls of enemies as well as of friends. Acting onthis principle head-hunters in Borneo hang wooden hooks beside the skulls of their slain ene-mies in the belief that this helps them on their forays to hook in fresh heads. One of theimplements of a Haida medicine-man is a hollow bone, in which he bottles up departingsouls, and so restores them to their owners. When any one yawns in their presence theHindoos always snap their thumbs, believing that this will hinder the soul from issuing throughthe open mouth. The Marquesans used to hold the mouth and nose of a dying man, in orderto keep him in life by preventing his soul from escaping; the same custom is reported of theNew Caledonians; and with the like intention the Bagobos of the Philippine Islands put ringsof brass wire on the wrists or ankles of their sick. On the other hand, the Itonamas of SouthAmerica seal up the eyes, nose, and mouth of a dying person, in case his ghost should getout and carry off others; and for a similar reason the people of Nias, who fear the spirits ofthe recently deceased and identify them with the breath, seek to confine the vagrant soul inits earthly tabernacle by bunging up the nose or tying up the jaws of the corpse. Before leav-ing a corpse the Wakelbura of Australia used to place hot coals in its ears in order to keepthe ghost in the body, until they had got such a good start that he could not overtake them. InSouthern Celebes, to hinder the escape of a woman’s soul in childbed, the nurse ties a bandas tightly as possible round the body of the expectant mother. The Minangkabauers ofPage 144"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Sumatra observe a similar custom; a skein of thread or a string is sometimes fastened roundthe wrist or loins of a woman in childbed, so that when her soul seeks to depart in her hour oftravail it may find the egress barred. And lest the soul of a babe should escape and be lost assoon as it is born, the Alfoors of Celebes, when a birth is about to take place, are careful toclose every opening in the house, even the keyhole; and they stop up every chink and crannyin the walls. Also they tie up the mouths of all animals inside and outside the house, for fearone of them might swallow the child’s soul. For a similar reason all persons present in thehouse, even the mother herself, are obliged to keep their mouths shut the whole time thebirth is taking place. When the question was put, Why they did not hold their noses also, lestthe child’s soul should get into one of them? the answer was that breath being exhaled aswell as inhaled through the nostrils, the soul would be expelled before it could have time tosettle down. Popular expressions in the language of civilised peoples, such as to have one’sheart in one’s mouth, or the soul on the lips or in the nose, show how natural is the idea thatthe life or soul may escape by the mouth or nostrils.Often the soul is conceived as a bird ready to take flight. This conception has probably lefttraces in most languages, and it lingers as a metaphor in poetry. The Malays carry out theconception of the bird-soul in a number of odd ways. If the soul is a bird on the wing, it maybe attracted by rice, and so either prevented from flying away or lured back again from itsperilous flight. Thus in Java when a child is placed on the ground for the first time (a momentwhich uncultured people seem to regard as especially dangerous), it is put in a hen-coop andthe mother makes a clucking sound, as if she were calling hens. And in Sintang, a district ofBorneo, when a person, whether man, woman, or child, has fallen out of a house or off a tree,and has been brought home, his wife or other kinswoman goes as speedily as possible to thespot where the accident happened, and there strews rice, which has been coloured yellow,while she utters the words, “Cluck! cluck! soul! So-and-so is in his house again. Cluck! cluck!soul!” Then she gathers up the rice in a basket, carries it to the sufferer, and drops the grainsfrom her hand on his head, saying again, “Cluck! cluck! soul!” Here the intention clearly is todecoy back the loitering bird-soul and replace it in the head of its owner.The soul of a sleeper is supposed to wander away from his body and actually to visit theplaces, to see the persons, and to perform the acts of which he dreams. For example, whenan Indian of Brazil or Guiana wakes up from a sound sleep, he is firmly convinced that hissoul has really been away hunting, fishing, felling trees, or whatever else he has dreamed ofdoing, while all the time his body has been lying motionless in his hammock. A whole Bororovillage has been thrown into a panic and nearly deserted because somebody had dreamedthat he saw enemies stealthily approaching it. A Macusi Indian in weak health, who dreamedthat his employer had made him haul the canoe up a series of difficult cataracts, bitterlyreproached his master next morning for his want of consideration in thus making a poorinvalid go out and toil during the night. The Indians of the Gran Chaco are often heard torelate the most incredible stories as things which they have themselves seen and heard;hence strangers who do not know them intimately say in their haste that these Indians areliars. In point of fact the Indians are firmly convinced of the truth of what they relate; for thesewonderful adventures are simply their dreams, which they do not distinguish from wakingrealities.Now the absence of the soul in sleep has its dangers, for if from any cause the soul shouldbe permanently detained away from the body, the person thus deprived of the vital principlemust die. There is a German belief that the soul escapes from a sleeper’s mouth in the formof a white mouse or a little bird, and that to prevent the return of the bird or animal would bePage 145"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"fatal to the sleeper. Hence in Transylvania they say that you should not let a child sleep withits mouth open, or its soul will slip out in the shape of a mouse, and the child will never wake.Many causes may detain the sleeper’s soul. Thus, his soul may meet the soul of anothersleeper and the two souls may fight; if a Guinea negro wakens with sore bones in the morn-ing, he thinks that his soul has been thrashed by another soul in sleep. Or it may meet thesoul of a person just deceased and be carried off by it; hence in the Aru Islands the inmatesof a house will not sleep the night after a death has taken place in it, because the soul of thedeceased is supposed to be still in the house and they fear to meet it in a dream. Again, thesoul of the sleeper may be prevented by an accident or by physical force from returning to hisbody. When a Dyak dreams of falling into the water, he supposes that this accident has reallybefallen his spirit, and he sends for a wizard, who fishes for the spirit with a hand-net in abasin of water till he catches it and restores it to its owner. The Santals tell how a man fellasleep, and growing very thirsty, his soul, in the form of a lizard, left his body and entered apitcher of water to drink. Just then the owner of the pitcher happened to cover it; so the soulcould not return to the body and the man died. While his friends were preparing to burn thebody some one uncovered the pitcher to get water. The lizard thus escaped and returned tothe body, which immediately revived; so the man rose up and asked his friends why theywere weeping. They told him they thought he was dead and were about to burn his body. Hesaid he had been down a well to get water, but had found it hard to get out and had justreturned. So they saw it all.It is a common rule with primitive people not to waken a sleeper, because his soul is awayand might not have time to get back; so if the man wakened without his soul, he would fallsick. If it is absolutely necessary to rouse a sleeper, it must be done very gradually, to allowthe soul time to return. A Fijian in Matuku, suddenly wakened from a nap by somebody tread-ing on his foot, has been heard bawling after his soul and imploring it to return. He had justbeen dreaming that he was far away in Tonga, and great was his alarm on suddenly waken-ing to find his body in Matuku. Death stared him in the face unless his soul could be inducedto speed at once across the sea and reanimate its deserted tenement. The man would proba-bly have died of fright if a missionary had not been at hand to allay his terror.Still more dangerous is it in the opinion of primitive man to move a sleeper or alter hisappearance, for if this were done the soul on its return might not be able to find or recogniseits body, and so the person would die. The Minangkabauers deem it highly improper to black-en or dirty the face of a sleeper, lest the absent soul should shrink from re-entering a bodythus disfigured. Patani Malays fancy that if a person’s face be painted while he sleeps, thesoul which has gone out of him will not recognise him, and he will sleep on till his face iswashed. In Bombay it is thought equivalent to murder to change the aspect of a sleeper, asby painting his face in fantastic colours or giving moustaches to a sleeping woman. For whenthe soul returns it will not know its own body, and the person will die.But in order that a man’s soul should quit his body, it is not necessary that he should beasleep. It may quit him in his waking hours, and then sickness, insanity, or death will be theresult. Thus a man of the Wurunjeri tribe in Australia lay at his last gasp because his spirithad departed from him. A medicine-man went in pursuit and caught the spirit by the middlejust as it was about to plunge into the sunset glow, which is the light cast by the souls of thedead as they pass in and out of the under-world, where the sun goes to rest. Having capturedthe vagrant spirit, the doctor brought it back under his opossum rug, laid himself down on thedying man, and put the soul back into him, so that after a time he revived. The Karens ofBurma are perpetually anxious about their souls, lest these should go roving from their bod-Page 146"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"ies, leaving the owners to die. When a man has reason to fear that his soul is about to takethis fatal step, a ceremony is performed to retain or recall it, in which the whole family musttake part. A meal is prepared consisting of a cock and hen, a special kind of rice, and a bunchof bananas. Then the head of the family takes the bowl which is used to skim rice, and knock-ing with it thrice on the top of the houseladder says: “Prrrroo! Come back, soul, do not tarryoutside! If it rains, you will be wet. If the sun shines, you will be hot. The gnats will sting you,the leeches will bite you, the tigers will devour you, the thunder will crush you. Prrrroo! Comeback, soul! Here it will be well with you. You shall want for nothing. Come and eat under shel-ter from the wind and the storm.” After that the family partakes of the meal, and the ceremonyends with everybody tying their right wrist with a string which has been charmed by a sorcer-er. Similarly the Lolos of South-western China believe that the soul leaves the body in chronicillness. In that case they read a sort of elaborate litany, calling on the soul by name andbeseeching it to return from the hills, the vales, the rivers, the forests, the fields, or from wher-ever it may be straying. At the same time cups of water, wine, and rice are set at the door forthe refreshment of the weary wandering spirit. When the ceremony is over, they tie a red cordround the arm of the sick man to tether the soul, and this cord is worn by him until it decaysand drops off.Some of the Congo tribes believe that when a man is ill, his soul has left his body and is wan-dering at large. The aid of the sorcerer is then called in to capture the vagrant spirit andrestore it to the invalid. Generally the physician declares that he has successfully chased thesoul into the branch of a tree. The whole town thereupon turns out and accompanies the doc-tor to the tree, where the strongest men are deputed to break off the branch in which the soulof the sick man is supposed to be lodged. This they do and carry the branch back to thetown, insinuating by their gestures that the burden is heavy and hard to bear. When thebranch has been brought to the sick man’s hut, he is placed in an upright position by its side,and the sorcerer performs the enchantments by which the soul is believed to be restored toits owner.Pining, sickness, great fright, and death are ascribed by the Bataks of Sumatra to theabsence of the soul from the body. At first they try to beckon the wanderer back, and to lurehim, like a fowl, by strewing rice. Then the following form of words is commonly repeated:“Come back, O soul, whether thou art lingering in the wood, or on the hills, or in the dale.See, I call thee with a toemba bras, with an egg of the fowl Rajah moelija, with the elevenhealing leaves. Detain it not, let it come straight here, detain it not, neither in the wood, noron the hill, nor in the dale. That may not be. O come straight home!” Once when a populartraveller was leaving a Kayan village, the mothers, fearing that their children’s souls might fol-low him on his journey, brought him the boards on which they carry their infants and beggedhim to pray that the souls of the little ones would return to the familiar boards and not goaway with him into the far country. To each board was fastened a looped string for the pur-pose of tethering the vagrant spirits, and through the loop each baby was made to pass achubby finger to make sure that its tiny soul would not wander away.In an Indian story a king conveys his soul into the dead body of a Brahman, and a hunchbackconveys his soul into the deserted body of the king. The hunchback is now king and the kingis a Brahman. However, the hunchback is induced to show his skill by transferring his soul tothe dead body of a parrot, and the king seizes the opportunity to regain possession of hisown body. A tale of the same type, with variations of detail, reappears among the Malays. Aking has incautiously transferred his soul to an ape, upon which the vizier adroitly inserts hisown soul into the king’s body and so takes possession of the queen and the kingdom, whilePage 147"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"the true king languishes at court in the outward semblance of an ape. But one day the falseking, who played for high stakes, was watching a combat of rams, and it happened that theanimal on which he had laid his money fell down dead. All efforts to restore animation provedunavailing till the false king, with the instinct of a true sportsman, transferred his own soul tothe body of the deceased ram, and thus renewed the fray. The real king in the body of theape saw his chance, and with great presence of mind darted back into his own body, whichthe vizier had rashly vacated. So he came to his own again, and the usurper in the ram’sbody met with the fate he richly deserved. Similarly the Greeks told how the soul ofHermotimus of Clazomenae used to quit his body and roam far and wide, bringing back intel-ligence of what he had seen on his rambles to his friends at home; until one day, when hisspirit was abroad, his enemies contrived to seize his deserted body and committed it to theflames.The departure of the soul is not always voluntary. It may be extracted from the body againstits will by ghosts, demons, or sorcerers. Hence, when a funeral is passing the house, theKarens tie their children with a special kind of string to a particular part of the house, lest thesouls of the children should leave their bodies and go into the corpse which is passing. Thechildren are kept tied in this way until the corpse is out of sight. And after the corpse hasbeen laid in the grave, but before the earth has been shovelled in, the mourners and friendsrange themselves round the grave, each with a bamboo split lengthwise in one hand and a lit-tle stick in the other; each man thrusts his bamboo into the grave, and drawing the stick alongthe groove of the bamboo points out to his soul that in this way it may easily climb up out ofthe tomb. While the earth is being shovelled in, the bamboos are kept out of the way, lest thesouls should be in them, and so should be inadvertently buried with the earth as it is beingthrown into the grave; and when the people leave the spot they carry away the bamboos,begging their souls to come with them. Further, on returning from the grave each Karen pro-vides himself with three little hooks made of branches of trees, and calling his spirit to followhim, at short intervals, as he returns, he makes a motion as if hooking it, and then thrusts thehook into the ground. This is done to prevent the soul of the living from staying behind withthe soul of the dead. When the Karo-Bataks have buried somebody and are filling in thegrave, a sorceress runs about beating the air with a stick. This she does in order to driveaway the souls of the survivors, for if one of these souls happened to slip into the grave andto be covered up with earth, its owner would die.In Uea, one of the Loyalty Islands, the souls of the dead seem to have been credited with thepower of stealing the souls of the living. For when a man was sick the soul-doctor would gowith a large troop of men and women to the graveyard. Here the men played on flutes andthe women whistled softly to lure the soul home. After this had gone on for some time theyformed in procession and moved homewards, the flutes playing and the women whistling allthe way, while they led back the wandering soul and drove it gently along with open palms.On entering the patient’s dwelling they commanded the soul in a loud voice to enter his body.Often the abduction of a man’s soul is set down to demons. Thus fits and convulsions aregenerally ascribed by the Chinese to the agency of certain mischievous spirits who love todraw men’s souls out of their bodies. At Amoy the spirits who serve babies and children inthis way rejoice in the high-sounding titles of “celestial agencies bestriding galloping horses”and “literary graduates residing halfway up in the sky.” When an infant is writhing in convul-sions, the frightened mother hastens to the roof of the house, and, waving about a bamboopole to which one of the child’s garments is attached, cries out several times “My child So-and-so, come back, return home!” Meantime, another inmate of the house bangs away at aPage 148"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"gong in the hope of attracting the attention of the strayed soul, which is supposed to recog-nise the familiar garment and to slip into it. The garment containing the soul is then placed onor beside the child, and if the child does not die recovery is sure to follow, sooner or later.Similarly some Indians catch a man’s lost soul in his boots and restore it to his body by put-ting his feet into them.In the Moluccas when a man is unwell it is thought that some devil has carried away his soulto the tree, mountain, or hill where he (the devil) resides. A sorcerer having pointed out thedevil’s abode, the friends of the patient carry thither cooked rice, fruit, fish, raw eggs, a hen, achicken, a silken robe, gold, armlets, and so forth. Having set out the food in order they pray,saying: “We come to offer to you, O devil, this offering of food, clothes, gold, and so on; takeit and release the soul of the patient for whom we pray. Let it return to his body, and he whonow is sick shall be made whole.” Then they eat a little and let the hen loose as a ransom forthe soul of the patient; also they put down the raw eggs; but the silken robe, the gold, and thearmlets they take home with them. As soon as they are come to the house they place a flatbowl containing the offerings which have been brought back at the sick man’s head, and sayto him: “Now is your soul released, and you shall fare well and live to grey hairs on the earth.” Demons are especially feared by persons who have just entered a new house. Hence at ahouse-warming among the Alfoors of Minahassa in Celebes the priest performs a ceremonyfor the purpose of restoring their souls to the inmates. He hangs up a bag at the place of sac-rifice and then goes through a list of the gods. There are so many of them that this takes himthe whole night through without stopping. In the morning he offers the gods an egg and somerice. By this time the souls of the household are supposed to be gathered in the bag. So thepriest takes the bag, and holding it on the head of the master of the house, says, “Here youhave your soul; go (soul) to-morrow away again.” He then does the same, saying the samewords, to the housewife and all the other members of the family. Amongst the same Alfoorsone way of recovering a sick man’s soul is to let down a bowl by a belt out of a window andfish for the soul till it is caught in the bowl and hauled up. And among the same people, whena priest is bringing back a sick man’s soul which he has caught in a cloth, he is preceded bya girl holding the large leaf of a certain palm over his head as an umbrella to keep him andthe soul from getting wet, in case it should rain; and he is followed by a man brandishing asword to deter other souls from any attempt at rescuing the captured spirit.Sometimes the lost soul is brought back in a visible shape. The Salish or Flathead Indians ofOregon believe that a man’s soul may be separated for a time from his body without causingdeath and without the man being aware of his loss. It is necessary, however, that the lost soulshould be soon found and restored to its owner or he will die. The name of the man who haslost his soul is revealed in a dream to the medicine-man, who hastens to inform the suffererof his loss. Generally a number of men have sustained a like loss at the same time; all theirnames are revealed to the medicine-man, and all employ him to recover their souls. Thewhole night long these soulless men go about the village from lodge to lodge, dancing andsinging. Towards daybreak they go into a separate lodge, which is closed up so as to be total-ly dark. A small hole is then made in the roof, through which the medicine-man, with a bunchof feathers, brushes in the souls, in the shape of bits of bone and the like, which he receiveson a piece of matting. A fire is next kindled, by the light of which the medicine-man sorts outthe souls. First he puts aside the souls of dead people, of which there are usually several; forif he were to give the soul of a dead person to a living man, the man would die instantly. Nexthe picks out the souls of all the persons present, and making them all to sit down before him,he takes the soul of each, in the shape of a splinter of bone, wood, or shell, and placing it onPage 149"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"the owner’s head, pats it with many prayers and contortions till it descends into the heart andso resumes its proper place.Again, souls may be extracted from their bodies or detained on their wanderings not only byghosts and demons but also by men, especially by sorcerers. In Fiji, if a criminal refused toconfess, the chief sent for a scarf with which “to catch away the soul of the rogue.” At thesight or even at the mention of the scarf the culprit generally made a clean breast. For if hedid not, the scarf would be waved over his head till his soul was caught in it, when it would becarefully folded up and nailed to the end of a chief’s canoe; and for want of his soul the crimi-nal would pine and die. The sorcerers of Danger Island used to set snares for souls. Thesnares were made of stout cinet, about fifteen to thirty feet long, with loops on either side ofdifferent sizes, to suit the different sizes of souls; for fat souls there were large loops, for thinsouls there were small ones. When a man was sick against whom the sorcerers had agrudge, they set up these soul-snares near his house and watched for the flight of his soul. Ifin the shape of a bird or an insect it was caught in the snare, the man would infallibly die. Insome parts of West Africa, indeed, wizards are continually setting traps to catch souls thatwander from their bodies in sleep; and when they have caught one, they tie it up over the fire,and as it shrivels in the heat the owner sickens. This is done, not out of any grudge towardsthe sufferer, but purely as a matter of business. The wizard does not care whose soul he hascaptured, and will readily restore it to its owner, if only he is paid for doing so. Some sorcer-ers keep regular asylums for strayed souls, and anybody who has lost or mislaid his own soulcan always have another one from the asylum on payment of the usual fee. No blame what-ever attaches to men who keep these private asylums or set traps for passing souls; it is theirprofession, and in the exercise of it they are actuated by no harsh or unkindly feelings. Butthere are also wretches who from pure spite or for the sake of lucre set and bait traps withthe deliberate purpose of catching the soul of a particular man; and in the bottom of the pot,hidden by the bait, are knives and sharp hooks which tear and rend the poor soul, eitherkilling it outright or mauling it so as to impair the health of its owner when it succeeds inescaping and returning to him. Miss Kingsley knew a Kruman who became very anxiousabout his soul, because for several nights he had smelt in his dreams the savoury smell ofsmoked crawfish seasoned with red pepper. Clearly some ill-wisher had set a trap baited withthis dainty for his dream-soul, intending to do him grievous bodily, or rather spiritual, harm;and for the next few nights great pains were taken to keep his soul from straying abroad inhis sleep. In the sweltering heat of the tropical night he lay sweating and snorting under ablanket, his nose and mouth tied up with a handkerchief to prevent the escape of his precioussoul. In Hawaii there were sorcerers who caught souls of living people, shut them up in cal-abashes, and gave them to people to eat. By squeezing a captured soul in their hands theydiscovered the place where people had been secretly buried.Nowhere perhaps is the art of abducting human souls more carefully cultivated or carried tohigher perfection than in the Malay Peninsula. Here the methods by which the wizard workshis will are various, and so too are his motives. Sometimes he desires to destroy an enemy,sometimes to win the love of a cold or bashful beauty. Thus, to take an instance of the lattersort of charm, the following are the directions given for securing the soul of one whom youwish to render distraught. When the moon, just risen, looks red above the eastern horizon, goout, and standing in the moonlight, with the big toe of your right foot on the big toe of yourleft, make a speaking-trumpet of your right hand and recite through it the following words: “OM. I loose my shaft, I loose it and the moon clouds over, I loose it, and the sun is extinguished. Page 150"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"I loose it, and the stars burn dim. But it is not the sun, moon, and stars that I shoot at, It is the stalk of the heart of that child of the congregation, So-and-so. Cluck! cluck! soul of So-and-so, come and walk with me, Come and sit with me, Come and sleep and share my pillow. Cluck! cluck! soul.”Repeat this thrice and after every repetition blow through your hollow fist. Or you may catchthe soul in your turban, thus. Go out on the night of the full moon and the two succeedingnights; sit down on an ant-hill facing the moon, burn incense, and recite the following incanta-tion: “I bring you a betel leaf to chew, Dab the lime on to it, Prince Ferocious, For Somebody, Prince Distraction’s daughter, to chew. Somebody at sunrise be distraught for love of me Somebody at sunset be distraught for love of me. As you remember your parents, remember me; As you remember your house and houseladder, remember me; When thunder rumbles, remember me; When wind whistles, remember me; When the heavens rain, remember me; When cocks crow, remember me; When the dial-bird tells its tales, remember me; When you look up at the sun, remember me; When you look up at the moon, remember me, For in that self-same moon I am there. Cluck! cluck! soul of Somebody come hither to me. I do not mean to let you have my soul, Let your soul come hither to mine.”Now wave the end of your turban towards the moon seven times each night. Go home andput it under your pillow, and if you want to wear it in the daytime, burn incense and say, “It isnot a turban that I carry in my girdle, but the soul of Somebody.”The Indians of the Nass River, in British Columbia, are impressed with a belief that a physi-cian may swallow his patient’s soul by mistake. A doctor who is believed to have done so ismade by the other members of the faculty to stand over the patient, while one of them thrustshis fingers down the doctor’s throat, another kneads him in the stomach with his knuckles,and a third slaps him on the back. If the soul is not in him after all, and if the same processhas been repeated upon all the medical men without success, it is concluded that the soulmust be in the head-doctor’s box. A party of doctors, therefore, waits upon him at his houseand requests him to produce his box. When he has done so and arranged its contents on anew mat, they take the votary of Aesculapius and hold him up by the heels with his head in ahole in the floor. In this position they wash his head, and “any water remaining from the ablu-tion is taken and poured upon the sick man’s head.” No doubt the lost soul is in the water.3. THE SOUL AS A SHADOW AND A REFLECTIONPage 151"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"But the spiritual dangers I have enumerated are not the only ones which beset the savage.Often he regards his shadow or reflection as his soul, or at all events as a vital part of him-self, and as such it is necessarily a source of danger to him. For if it is trampled upon, struck,or stabbed, he will feel the injury as if it were done to his person; and if it is detached fromhim entirely (as he believes that it may be) he will die. In the island of Wetar there are magi-cians who can make a man ill by stabbing his shadow with a pike or hacking it with a sword.After Sankara had destroyed the Buddhists in India, it is said that he journeyed to Nepaul,where he had some difference of opinion with the Grand Lama. To prove his supernaturalpowers, he soared into the air. But as he mounted up the Grand Lama, perceiving his shadowswaying and wavering on the ground, struck his knife into it and down fell Sankara and brokehis neck.In the Banks Islands there are some stones of a remarkably long shape which go by thename of “eating ghosts,” because certain powerful and dangerous ghosts are believed tolodge in them. If a man’s shadow falls on one of these stones, the ghost will draw his soul outfrom him, so that he will die. Such stones, therefore, are set in a house to guard it; and amessenger sent to a house by the absent owner will call out the name of the sender, lest thewatchful ghost in the stone should fancy that he came with evil intent and should do him amischief. At a funeral in China, when the lid is about to be placed on the coffin, most of thebystanders, with the exception of the nearest kin, retire a few steps or even retreat to anotherroom, for a person’s health is believed to be endangered by allowing his shadow to beenclosed in a coffin. And when the coffin is about to be lowered into the grave most of thespectators recoil to a little distance lest their shadows should fall into the grave and harmshould thus be done to their persons. The geomancer and his assistants stand on the side ofthe grave which is turned away from the sun; and the grave-diggers and coffin-bearers attachtheir shadows firmly to their persons by tying a strip of cloth tightly round their waists. Nor is ithuman beings alone who are thus liable to be injured by means of their shadows. Animals areto some extent in the same predicament. A small snail, which frequents the neighbourhood ofthe limestone hills in Perak, is believed to suck the blood of cattle through their shadows;hence the beasts grow lean and sometimes die from loss of blood. The ancients supposedthat in Arabia, if a hyaena trod on a man’s shadow, it deprived him of the power of speechand motion; and that if a dog, standing on a roof in the moonlight, cast a shadow on theground and a hyaena trod on it, the dog would fall down as if dragged with a rope. Clearly inthese cases the shadow, if not equivalent to the soul, is at least regarded as a living part ofthe man or the animal, so that injury done to the shadow is felt by the person or animal as if itwere done to his body.Conversely, if the shadow is a vital part of a man or an animal, it may under certain circum-stances be as hazardous to be touched by it as it would be to come into contact with the per-son or animal. Hence the savage makes it a rule to shun the shadow of certain personswhom for various reasons he regards as sources of dangerous influence. Amongst the dan-gerous classes he commonly ranks mourners and women in general, but especially his moth-er-in-law. The Shuswap Indians think that the shadow of a mourner falling upon a personwould make him sick. Amongst the Kurnai of Victoria novices at initiation were cautioned notto let a woman’s shadow fall across them, as this would make them thin, lazy, and stupid. AnAustralian native is said to have once nearly died of fright because the shadow of his mother-in-law fell on his legs as he lay asleep under a tree. The awe and dread with which the untu-tored savage contemplates his mother-in-law are amongst the most familiar facts of anthro-pology. In the Yuin tribes of New South Wales the rule which forbade a man to hold any com-Page 152"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"munication with his wife’s mother was very strict. He might not look at her or even in herdirection. It was a ground of divorce if his shadow happened to fall on his mother-in-law: inthat case he had to leave his wife, and she returned to her parents. In New Britain the nativeimagination fails to conceive the extent and nature of the calamities which would result from aman’s accidentally speaking to his wife’s mother; suicide of one or both would probably bethe only course open to them. The most solemn form of oath a New Briton can take is, “Sir, ifI am not telling the truth, I hope I may shake hands with my mother-in-law.”Where the shadow is regarded as so intimately bound up with the life of the man that its lossentails debility or death, it is natural to expect that its diminution should be regarded withsolicitude and apprehension, as betokening a corresponding decrease in the vital energy ofits owner. In Amboyna and Uliase, two islands near the equator, where necessarily there is lit-tle or no shadow cast at noon, the people make it a rule not to go out of the house at mid-day, because they fancy that by doing so a man may lose the shadow of his soul. TheMangaians tell of a mighty warrior, Tukaitawa, whose strength waxed and waned with thelength of his shadow. In the morning, when his shadow fell longest, his strength was greatest;but as the shadow shortened towards noon his strength ebbed with it, till exactly at noon itreached its lowest point; then, as the shadow stretched out in the afternoon, his strengthreturned. A certain hero discovered the secret of Tukaitawa’s strength and slew him at noon.The savage Besisis of the Malay Peninsula fear to bury their dead at noon, because theyfancy that the shortness of their shadows at that hour would sympathetically shorten theirown lives.Nowhere, perhaps, does the equivalence of the shadow to the life or soul come out moreclearly than in some customs practised to this day in South-eastern Europe. In modernGreece, when the foundation of a new building is being laid, it is the custom to kill a cock, aram, or a lamb, and to let its blood flow on the foundation-stone, under which the animal isafterwards buried. The object of the sacrifice is to give strength and stability to the building.But sometimes, instead of killing an animal, the builder entices a man to the foundation-stone,secretly measures his body, or a part of it, or his shadow, and buries the measure under thefoundation-stone; or he lays the foundation-stone upon the man’s shadow. It is believed thatthe man will die within the year. The Roumanians of Transylvania think that he whose shadowis thus immured will die within forty days; so persons passing by a building which is in courseof erection may hear a warning cry, “Beware lest they take thy shadow!” Not long ago therewere still shadow-traders whose business it was to provide architects with the shadows nec-essary for securing their walls. In these cases the measure of the shadow is looked on asequivalent to the shadow itself, and to bury it is to bury the life or soul of the man, who,deprived of it, must die. Thus the custom is a substitute for the old practice of immuring a liv-ing person in the walls, or crushing him under the foundation-stone of a new building, in orderto give strength and durability to the structure, or more definitely in order that the angry ghostmay haunt the place and guard it against the intrusion of enemies.As some peoples believe a man’s soul to be in his shadow, so other (or the same) peoplesbelieve it to be in his reflection in water or a mirror. Thus “the Andamanese do not regard theirshadows but their reflections (in any mirror) as their souls.” When the Motumotu of NewGuinea first saw their likenesses in a looking-glass, they thought that their reflections weretheir souls. In New Caledonia the old men are of opinion that a person’s reflection in water ora mirror is his soul; but the younger men, taught by the Catholic priests, maintain that it is areflection and nothing more, just like the reflection of palm-trees in the water. The reflection-soul, being external to the man, is exposed to much the same dangers as the shadow-soul.Page 153"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The Zulus will not look into a dark pool because they think there is a beast in it which will takeaway their reflections, so that they die. The Basutos say that crocodiles have the power ofthus killing a man by dragging his reflection under water. When one of them dies suddenlyand from no apparent cause, his relatives will allege that a crocodile must have taken hisshadow some time when he crossed a stream. In Saddle Island, Melanesia, there is a pool“into which if any one looks he dies; the malignant spirit takes hold upon his life by means ofhis reflection on the water.”We can now understand why it was a maxim both in ancient India and ancient Greece not tolook at one’s reflection in water, and why the Greeks regarded it as an omen of death if aman dreamed of seeing himself so reflected. They feared that the water-spirits would drag theperson’s reflection or soul under water, leaving him soulless to perish. This was probably theorigin of the classical story of the beautiful Narcissus, who languished and died through see-ing his reflection in the water.Further, we can now explain the widespread custom of covering up mirrors or turning them tothe wall after a death has taken place in the house. It is feared that the soul, projected out ofthe person in the shape of his reflection in the mirror, may be carried off by the ghost of thedeparted, which is commonly supposed to linger about the house till the burial. The custom isthus exactly parallel to the Aru custom of not sleeping in a house after a death for fear thatthe soul, projected out of the body in a dream, may meet the ghost and be carried off by it.The reason why sick people should not see themselves in a mirror, and why the mirror in asick-room is therefore covered up, is also plain; in time of sickness, when the soul might takeflight so easily, it is particularly dangerous to project it out of the body by means of the reflec-tion in a mirror. The rule is therefore precisely parallel to the rule observed by some peoplesof not allowing sick people to sleep; for in sleep the soul is projected out of the body, andthere is always a risk that it may not return.As with shadows and reflections, so with portraits; they are often believed to contain the soulof the person portrayed. People who hold this belief are naturally loth to have their likenessestaken; for if the portrait is the soul, or at least a vital part of the person portrayed, whoeverpossesses the portrait will be able to exercise a fatal influence over the original of it. Thus theEsquimaux of Bering Strait believe that persons dealing in witchcraft have the power of steal-ing a person’s shade, so that without it he will pine away and die. Once at a village on thelower Yukon River an explorer had set up his camera to get a picture of the people as theywere moving about among their houses. While he was focusing the instrument, the headmanof the village came up and insisted on peeping under the cloth. Being allowed to do so, hegazed intently for a minute at the moving figures on the ground glass, then suddenly withdrewhis head and bawled at the top of his voice to the people, “He has all of your shades in thisbox.” A panic ensued among the group, and in an instant they disappeared helterskelter intotheir houses. The Tepehuanes of Mexico stood in mortal terror of the camera, and five days’persuasion was necessary to induce them to pose for it. When at last they consented, theylooked like criminals about to be executed. They believed that by photographing people theartist could carry off their souls and devour them at his leisure moments. They said that, whenthe pictures reached his country, they would die or some other evil would befall them. WhenDr. Catat and some companions were exploring the Bara country on the west coast ofMadagascar, the people suddenly became hostile. The day before the travellers, not withoutdifficulty, had photographed the royal family, and now found themselves accused of taking thesouls of the natives for the purpose of selling them when they returned to France. Denial wasvain; in compliance with the custom of the country they were obliged to catch the souls, whichPage 154"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"were then put into a basket and ordered by Dr. Catat to return to their respective owners.Some villagers in Sikhim betrayed a lively horror and hid away whenever the lens of a cam-era, or “the evil eye of the box” as they called it, was turned on them. They thought it tookaway their souls with their pictures, and so put it in the power of the owner of the pictures tocast spells on them, and they alleged that a photograph of the scenery blighted the land-scape. Until the reign of the late King of Siam no Siamese coins were ever stamped with theimage of the king, “for at that time there was a strong prejudice against the making of por-traits in any medium. Europeans who travel into the jungle have, even at the present time,only to point a camera at a crowd to procure its instant dispersion. When a copy of the face ofa person is made and taken away from him, a portion of his life goes with the picture. Unlessthe sovereign had been blessed with the years of a Methusaleh he could scarcely have per-mitted his life to be distributed in small pieces together with the coins of the realm.”Beliefs of the same sort still linger in various parts of Europe. Not very many years ago someold women in the Greek island of Carpathus were very angry at having their likenessesdrawn, thinking that in consequence they would pine and die. There are persons in the Westof Scotland “who refuse to have their likenesses taken lest it prove unlucky; and give asinstances the cases of several of their friends who never had a day’s health after being pho-tographed.”Chapter XIXTabooed Acts1. TABOOS ON INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERSSO much for the primitive conceptions of the soul and the dangers to which it is exposed.These conceptions are not limited to one people or country; with variations of detail they arefound all over the world, and survive, as we have seen, in modern Europe. Beliefs so deep-seated and so widespread must necessarily have contributed to shape the mould in which theearly kingship was cast. For if every person was at such pains to save his own soul from theperils which threatened it on so many sides, how much more carefully must he have beenguarded upon whose life hung the welfare and even the existence of the whole people, andwhom therefore it was the common interest of all to preserve? Therefore we should expect tofind the king’s life protected by a system of precautions or safeguards still more numerousand minute than those which in primitive society every man adopts for the safety of his ownsoul. Now in point of fact the life of the early kings is regulated, as we have seen and shallsee more fully presently, by a very exact code of rules. May we not then conjecture that theserules are in fact the very safeguards which we should expect to find adopted for the protec-tion of the king’s life? An examination of the rules themselves confirms this conjecture. Forfrom this it appears that some of the rules observed by the kings are identical with thoseobserved by private persons out of regard for the safety of their souls; and even of thosewhich seem peculiar to the king, many, if not all, are most readily explained on the hypothesisthat they are nothing but safeguards or lifeguards of the king. I will now enumerate some ofthese royal rules or taboos, offering on each of them such comments and explanations asmay serve to set the original intention of the rule in its proper light.As the object of the royal taboos is to isolate the king from all sources of danger, their generaleffect is to compel him to live in a state of seclusion, more or less complete, according to thenumber and stringency of the rules he observes. Now of all sources of danger none are morePage 155"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"dreaded by the savage than magic and witchcraft, and he suspects all strangers of practisingthese black arts. To guard against the baneful influence exerted voluntarily or involuntarily bystrangers is therefore an elementary dictate of savage prudence. Hence before strangers areallowed to enter a district, or at least before they are permitted to mingle freely with the inhab-itants, certain ceremonies are often performed by the natives of the country for the purpose ofdisarming the strangers of their magical powers, of counteracting the baneful influence whichis believed to emanate from them, or of disinfecting, so to speak, the tainted atmosphere bywhich they are supposed to be surrounded. Thus, when the ambassadors sent by Justin II.,Emperor of the East, to conclude a peace with the Turks had reached their destination, theywere received by shamans, who subjected them to a ceremonial purification for the purposeof exorcising all harmful influence. Having deposited the goods brought by the ambassadorsin an open place, these wizards carried burning branches of incense round them, while theyrang a bell and beat on a tambourine, snorting and falling into a state of frenzy in their effortsto dispel the powers of evil. Afterwards they purified the ambassadors themselves by leadingthem through the flames. In the island of Nanumea (South Pacific) strangers from ships orfrom other islands were not allowed to communicate with the people until they all, or a few asrepresentatives of the rest, had been taken to each of the four temples in the island, andprayers offered that the god would avert any disease or treachery which these strangersmight have brought with them. Meat offerings were also laid upon the altars, accompanied bysongs and dances in honour of the god. While these ceremonies were going on, all the peo-ple except the priests and their attendants kept out of sight. Amongst the Ot Danoms ofBorneo it is the custom that strangers entering the territory should pay to the natives a certainsum, which is spent in the sacrifice of buffaloes or pigs to the spirits of the land and water, inorder to reconcile them to the presence of the strangers, and to induce them not to withdrawtheir favour from the people of the country, but to bless the rice-harvest, and so forth. Themen of a certain district in Borneo, fearing to look upon a European traveller lest he shouldmake them ill, warned their wives and children not to go near him. Those who could notrestrain their curiosity killed fowls to appease the evil spirits and smeared themselves with theblood. “More dreaded,” says a traveller in Central Borneo, “than the evil spirits of the neigh-bourhood are the evil spirits from a distance which accompany travellers. When a companyfrom the middle Mahakam River visited me among the Blu-u Kayans in the year 1897, nowoman showed herself outside her house without a burning bundle of plehiding bark, thestinking smoke of which drives away evil spirits.”When Crevaux was travelling in South America he entered a village of the Apalai Indians. Afew moments after his arrival some of the Indians brought him a number of large black ants,of a species whose bite is painful, fastened on palm leaves. Then all the people of the village,without distinction of age or sex, presented themselves to him, and he had to sting them allwith the ants on their faces, thighs, and other parts of their bodies. Sometimes, when heapplied the ants too tenderly, they called out “More! more!” and were not satisfied till their skinwas thickly studded with tiny swellings like what might have been produced by whipping themwith nettles. The object of this ceremony is made plain by the custom observed in Amboynaand Uliase of sprinkling sick people with pungent spices, such as ginger and cloves, chewedfine, in order by the prickling sensation to drive away the demon of disease which may beclinging to their persons. In Java a popular cure for gout or rheumatism is to rub Spanish pep-per into the nails of the fingers and toes of the sufferer; the pungency of the pepper is sup-posed to be too much for the gout or rheumatism, who accordingly departs in haste. So onthe Slave Coast the mother of a sick child sometimes believes that an evil spirit has takenpossession of the child’s body, and in order to drive him out, she makes small cuts in thebody of the little sufferer and inserts green peppers or spices in the wounds, believing thatPage 156"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"she will thereby hurt the evil spirit and force him to be gone. The poor child naturally screamswith pain, but the mother hardens her heart in the belief that the demon is suffering equally.It is probable that the same dread of strangers, rather than any desire to do them honour, isthe motive of certain ceremonies which are sometimes observed at their reception, but ofwhich the intention is not directly stated. In the Ongtong Java Islands, which are inhabited byPolynesians, the priests or sorcerers seem to wield great influence. Their main business is tosummon or exorcise spirits for the purpose of averting or dispelling sickness, and of procuringfavourable winds, a good catch of fish, and so on. When strangers land on the islands, theyare first of all received by the sorcerers, sprinkled with water, anointed with oil, and girt withdried pandanus leaves. At the same time sand and water are freely thrown about in all direc-tions, and the newcomer and his boat are wiped with green leaves. After this ceremony thestrangers are introduced by the sorcerers to the chief. In Afghanistan and in some parts ofPersia the traveller, before he enters a village, is frequently received with a sacrifice of animallife or food, or of fire and incense. The Afghan Boundary Mission, in passing by villages inAfghanistan, was often met with fire and incense. Sometimes a tray of lighted embers isthrown under the hoofs of the traveller’s horse, with the words, “You are welcome.” On enter-ing a village in Central Africa Emin Pasha was received with the sacrifice of two goats; theirblood was sprinkled on the path and the chief stepped over the blood to greet Emin.Sometimes the dread of strangers and their magic is too great to allow of their reception onany terms. Thus when Speke arrived at a certain village, the natives shut their doors againsthim, “because they had never before seen a white man nor the tin boxes that the men werecarrying: ‘Who knows,’ they said, ‘but that these very boxes are the plundering Watuta trans-formed and come to kill us? You cannot be admitted.’ No persuasion could avail with them,and the party had to proceed to the next village.”The fear thus entertained of alien visitors is often mutual. Entering a strange land the savagefeels that he is treading enchanted ground, and he takes steps to guard against the demonsthat haunt it and the magical arts of its inhabitants. Thus on going to a strange land theMaoris performed certain ceremonies to make it “common,” lest it might have been previously“sacred.” When Baron Miklucho-Maclay was approaching a village on the Maclay Coast ofNew Guinea, one of the natives who accompanied him broke a branch from a tree and goingaside whispered to it for a while; then stepping up to each member of the party, one afteranother, he spat something upon his back and gave him some blows with the branch. Lastly,he went into the forest and buried the branch under withered leaves in the thickest part of thejungle. This ceremony was believed to protect the party against all treachery and danger inthe village they were approaching. The idea probably was that the malignant influences weredrawn off from the persons into the branch and buried with it in the depths of the forest. InAustralia, when a strange tribe has been invited into a district and is approaching theencampment of the tribe which owns the land, “the strangers carry lighted bark or burningsticks in their hands, for the purpose, they say, of clearing and purifying the air.” When theToradjas are on a head-hunting expedition and have entered the enemy’s country, they maynot eat any fruits which the foe has planted nor any animal which he has reared until theyhave first committed an act of hostility, as by burning a house or killing a man. They think thatif they broke this rule they would receive something of the soul or spiritual essence of theenemy into themselves, which would destroy the mystic virtue of their talismans.Again, it is believed that a man who has been on a journey may have contracted some magicevil from the strangers with whom he has associated. Hence, on returning home, before he isreadmitted to the society of his tribe and friends, he has to undergo certain purificatory cere-Page 157"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"monies. Thus the Bechuanas “cleanse or purify themselves after journeys by shaving theirheads, etc., lest they should have contracted from strangers some evil by witchcraft or sor-cery.” In some parts of Western Africa, when a man returns home after a long absence,before he is allowed to visit his wife, he must wash his person with a particular fluid, andreceive from the sorcerer a certain mark on his forehead, in order to counteract any magicspell which a stranger woman may have cast on him in his absence, and which might becommunicated through him to the women of his village. Two Hindoo ambassadors, who hadbeen sent to England by a native prince and had returned to India, were considered to haveso polluted themselves by contact with strangers that nothing but being born again couldrestore them to purity. “For the purpose of regeneration it is directed to make an image ofpure gold of the female power of nature, in the shape either of a woman or of a cow. In thisstatue the person to be regenerated is enclosed, and dragged through the usual channel. Asa statue of pure gold and of proper dimensions would be too expensive, it is sufficient tomake an image of the sacred Yoni, through which the person to be regenerated is to pass.”Such an image of pure gold was made at the prince’s command, and his ambassadors wereborn again by being dragged through it.When precautions like these are taken on behalf of the people in general against the malig-nant influence supposed to be exercised by strangers, it is no wonder that special measuresare adopted to protect the king from the same insidious danger. In the middle ages theenvoys who visited a Tartar Khan were obliged to pass between two fires before they wereadmitted to his presence, and the gifts they brought were also carried between the fires. Thereason assigned for the custom was that the fire purged away any magic influence which thestrangers might mean to exercise over the Khan. When subject chiefs come with their ret-inues to visit Kalamba (the most powerful chief of the Bashilange in the Congo Basin) for thefirst time or after being rebellious, they have to bathe, men and women together, in twobrooks on two successive days, passing the nights under the open sky in the market-place.After the second bath they proceed, entirely naked, to the house of Kalamba, who makes along white mark on the breast and forehead of each of them. Then they return to the market-place and dress, after which they undergo the pepper ordeal. Pepper is dropped into the eyesof each of them, and while this is being done the sufferer has to make a confession of all hissins, to answer all questions that may be put to him, and to take certain vows. This ends theceremony, and the strangers are now free to take up their quarters in the town for as long asthey choose to remain.2. TABOOS ON EATING AND DRINKINGIn the opinion of savages the acts of eating and drinking are attended with special danger; forat these times the soul may escape from the mouth, or be extracted by the magic arts of anenemy present. Among the Ewe-speaking peoples of the Slave Coast “the common beliefseems to be that the indwelling spirit leaves the body and returns to it through the mouth;hence, should it have gone out, it behoves a man to be careful about opening his mouth, lesta homeless spirit should take advantage of the opportunity and enter his body. This, itappears, is considered most likely to take place while the man is eating.” Precautions aretherefore adopted to guard against these dangers. Thus of the Bataks it is said that “since thesoul can leave the body, they always take care to prevent their soul from straying on occa-sions when they have most need of it. But it is only possible to prevent the soul from strayingwhen one is in the house. At feasts one may find the whole house shut up, in order that thesoul may stay and enjoy the good things set before it.” The Zafimanelo in Madagascar locktheir doors when they eat, and hardly any one ever sees them eating. The Warua will notPage 158"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"allow any one to see them eating and drinking, being doubly particular that no person of theopposite sex shall see them doing so. “I had to pay a man to let me see him drink; I could notmake a man let a woman see him drink.” When offered a drink they often ask that a clothmay be held up to hide them whilst drinking.If these are the ordinary precautions taken by common people, the precautions taken bykings are extraordinary. The king of Loango may not be seen eating or drinking by man orbeast under pain of death. A favourite dog having broken into the room where the king wasdining, the king ordered it to be killed on the spot. Once the king’s own son, a boy of twelveyears old, inadvertently saw the king drink. Immediately the king ordered him to be finelyapparelled and feasted, after which he commanded him to be cut in quarters, and carriedabout the city with a proclamation that he had seen the king drink. “When the king has a mindto drink, he has a cup of wine brought; he that brings it has a bell in his hand, and as soon ashe has delivered the cup to the king, he turns his face from him and rings the bell, on whichall present fall down with their faces to the ground, and continue so till the king has drank....His eating is much in the same style, for which he has a house on purpose, where his vict-uals are set upon a bensa or table: which he goes to, and shuts the door: when he has done,he knocks and comes out. So that none ever see the king eat or drink. For it is believed thatif any one should, the king shall immediately die.” The remnants of his food are buried, doubt-less to prevent them from falling into the hands of sorcerers, who by means of these frag-ments might cast a fatal spell over the monarch. The rules observed by the neighbouring kingof Cacongo were similar; it was thought that the king would die if any of his subjects were tosee him drink. It is a capital offence to see the king of Dahomey at his meals. When he drinksin public, as he does on extraordinary occasions, he hides himself behind a curtain, or hand-kerchiefs are held up round his head, and all the people throw themselves with their faces tothe earth. When the king of Bunyoro in Central Africa went to drink milk in the dairy, everyman must leave the royal enclosure and all the women had to cover their heads till the kingreturned. No one might see him drink. One wife accompanied him to the dairy and handedhim the milk-pot, but she turned away her face while he drained it.3. TABOOS ON SHOWING THE FACEIn some of the preceding cases the intention of eating and drinking in strict seclusion mayperhaps be to hinder evil influences from entering the body rather than to prevent the escapeof the soul. This certainly is the motive of some drinking customs observed by natives of theCongo region. Thus we are told of these people that “there is hardly a native who would dareto swallow a liquid without first conjuring the spirits. One of them rings a bell all the time he isdrinking; another crouches down and places his left hand on the earth; another veils his head;another puts a stalk of grass or a leaf in his hair, or marks his forehead with a line of clay.This fetish custom assumes very varied forms. To explain them, the black is satisfied to saythat they are an energetic mode of conjuring spirits.” In this part of the world a chief will com-monly ring a bell at each draught of beer which he swallows, and at the same moment a ladstationed in front of him brandishes a spear “to keep at bay the spirits which might try tosneak into the old chief’s body by the same road as the beer.” The same motive of wardingoff evil spirits probably explains the custom observed by some African sultans of veiling theirfaces. The Sultan of Darfur wraps up his face with a piece of white muslin, which goes roundhis head several times, covering his mouth and nose first, and then his forehead, so that onlyhis eyes are visible. The same custom of veiling the face as a mark of sovereignty is said tobe observed in other parts of Central Africa. The Sultan of Wadai always speaks from behinda curtain; no one sees his face except his intimates and a few favoured persons.Page 159"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"4. TABOOS ON QUITTING THE HOUSEBy an extension of the like precaution kings are sometimes forbidden ever to leave theirpalaces; or, if they are allowed to do so, their subjects are forbidden to see them abroad. Thefetish king of Benin, who was worshipped as a deity by his subjects, might not quit his palace.After his coronation the king of Loango is confined to his palace, which he may not leave. Theking of Onitsha “does not step out of his house into the town unless a human sacrifice ismade to propitiate the gods: on this account he never goes out beyond the precincts of hispremises.” Indeed we are told that he may not quit his palace under pain of death or of givingup one or more slaves to be executed in his presence. As the wealth of the country is meas-ured in slaves, the king takes good care not to infringe the law. Yet once a year at the Feastof Yams the king is allowed, and even required by custom, to dance before his people outsidethe high mud wall of the palace. In dancing he carries a great weight, generally a sack ofearth, on his back to prove that he is still able to support the burden and cares of state. Werehe unable to discharge this duty, he would be immediately deposed and perhaps stoned. Thekings of Ethiopia were worshipped as gods, but were mostly kept shut up in their palaces. Onthe mountainous coast of Pontus there dwelt in antiquity a rude and warlike people namedthe Mosyni or Mosynoeci, through whose rugged country the Ten Thousand marched on theirfamous retreat from Asia to Europe. These barbarians kept their king in close custody at thetop of a high tower, from which after his election he was never more allowed to descend.Here he dispensed justice to his people; but if he offended them, they punished him by stop-ping his rations for a whole day, or even starving him to death. The kings of Sabaea orSheba, the spice country of Arabia, were not allowed to go out of their palaces; if they did so,the mob stoned them to death. But at the top of the palace there was a window with a chainattached to it. If any man deemed he had suffered wrong, he pulled the chain, and the kingperceived him and called him in and gave judgment.5. TABOOS ON LEAVING FOOD OVERAgain, magic mischief may be wrought upon a man through the remains of the food he haspartaken of, or the dishes out of which he has eaten. On the principles of sympathetic magica real connexion continues to subsist between the food which a man has in his stomach andthe refuse of it which he has left untouched, and hence by injuring the refuse you can simulta-neously injure the eater. Among the Narrinyeri of South Australia every adult is constantly onthe look-out for bones of beasts, birds, or fish, of which the flesh has been eaten by some-body, in order to construct a deadly charm out of them. Every one is therefore careful to burnthe bones of the animals which he has eaten, lest they should fall into the hands of a sorcer-er. Too often, however, the sorcerer succeeds in getting hold of such a bone, and when hedoes so he believes that he has the power of life and death over the man, woman, or childwho ate the flesh of the animal. To put the charm in operation he makes a paste of red ochreand fish oil, inserts in it the eye of a cod and a small piece of the flesh of a corpse, and hav-ing rolled the compound into a ball sticks it on the top of the bone. After being left for sometime in the bosom of a dead body, in order that it may derive a deadly potency by contact withcorruption, the magical implement is set up in the ground near the fire, and as the ball melts,so the person against whom the charm is directed wastes with disease; if the ball is meltedquite away, the victim will die. When the bewitched man learns of the spell that is being castupon him, he endeavours to buy the bone from the sorcerer, and if he obtains it he breaks thecharm by throwing the bone into a river or lake. In Tana, one of the New Hebrides, peoplebury or throw into the sea the leavings of their food, lest these should fall into the hands ofPage 160"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"the disease-makers. For if a disease-maker finds the remnants of a meal, say the skin of abanana, he picks it up and burns it slowly in the fire. As it burns, the person who ate thebanana falls ill and sends to the disease-maker, offering him presents if he will stop burningthe banana skin. In New Guinea the natives take the utmost care to destroy or conceal thehusks and other remains of their food, lest these should be found by their enemies and usedby them for the injury or destruction of the eaters. Hence they burn their leavings, throw theminto the sea, or otherwise put them out of harm’s way.From a like fear, no doubt, of sorcery, no one may touch the food which the king of Loangoleaves upon his plate; it is buried in a hole in the ground. And no one may drink out of theking’s vessel. In antiquity the Romans used immediately to break the shells of eggs and ofsnails which they had eaten, in order to prevent enemies from making magic with them. Thecommon practice, still observed among us, of breaking egg-shells after the eggs have beeneaten may very well have originated in the same superstition.The superstitious fear of the magic that may be wrought on a man through the leavings of hisfood has had the beneficial effect of inducing many savages to destroy refuse which, if left torot, might through its corruption have proved a real, not a merely imaginary, source of diseaseand death. Nor is it only the sanitary condition of a tribe which has benefited by this supersti-tion; curiously enough the same baseless dread, the same false notion of causation, has indi-rectly strengthened the moral bonds of hospitality, honour, and good faith among men whoentertain it. For it is obvious that no one who intends to harm a man by working magic on therefuse of his food will himself partake of that food, because if he did so he would, on the prin-ciples of sympathetic magic, suffer equally with his enemy from any injury done to the refuse.This is the idea which in primitive society lends sanctity to the bond produced by eatingtogether; by participation in the same food two men give, as it were, hostages for their goodbehaviour; each guarantees the other that he will devise no mischief against him, since, beingphysically united with him by the common food in their stomachs, any harm he might do to hisfellow would recoil on his own head with precisely the same force with which it fell on thehead of his victim. In strict logic, however, the sympathetic bond lasts only so long as the foodis in the stomach of each of the parties. Hence the covenant formed by eating together is lesssolemn and durable than the covenant formed by transfusing the blood of the covenantingparties into each other’s veins, for this transfusion seems to knit them together for life.Chapter XXTabooed Persons1. CHIEFS AND KINGS TABOOEDWE have seen that the Mikado’s food was cooked every day in new pots and served up innew dishes; both pots and dishes were of common clay, in order that they might be broken orlaid aside after they had been once used. They were generally broken, for it was believed thatif any one else ate his food out of these sacred dishes, his mouth and throat would becomeswollen and inflamed. The same ill effect was thought to be experienced by any one whoshould wear the Mikado’s clothes without his leave; he would have swellings and pains allover his body. In Fiji there is a special name (kana lama) for the disease supposed to becaused by eating out of a chief’s dishes or wearing his clothes. “The throat and body swell,and the impious person dies. I had a fine mat given to me by a man who durst not use itbecause Thakombau’s eldest son had sat upon it. There was always a family or clan of com-moners who were exempt from this danger. I was talking about this once to Thakombau. ‘OhPage 161"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"yes,’ said he. ‘Here, So-and-so! come and scratch my back.’ The man scratched; he was oneof those who could do it with impunity.” The name of the men thus highly privileged was Nanduka ni, or the dirt of the chief.In the evil effects thus supposed to follow upon the use of the vessels or clothes of theMikado and a Fijian chief we see that other side of the god-man’s character to which attentionhas been already called. The divine person is a source of danger as well as of blessing; hemust not only be guarded, he must also be guarded against. His sacred organism, so delicatethat a touch may disorder it, is also, as it were, electrically charged with a powerful magical orspiritual force which may discharge itself with fatal effect on whatever comes in contact withit. Accordingly the isolation of the man-god is quite as necessary for the safety of others asfor his own. His magical virtue is in the strictest sense of the word contagious: his divinity is afire, which, under proper restraints, confers endless blessings, but, if rashly touched orallowed to break bounds, burns and destroys what it touches. Hence the disastrous effectssupposed to attend a breach of taboo; the offender has thrust his hand into the divine fire,which shrivels up and consumes him on the spot.The Nubas, for example, who inhabit the wooded and fertile range of Jebel Nuba in EasternAfrica, believe that they would die if they entered the house of their priestly king; however,they can evade the penalty of their intrusion by baring the left shoulder and getting the king tolay his hand on it. And were any man to sit on a stone which the king has consecrated to hisown use, the transgressor would die within the year. The Cazembes of Angola regard theirking as so holy that no one can touch him without being killed by the magical power whichpervades his sacred person. But since contact with him is sometimes unavoidable, they havedevised a means whereby the sinner can escape with his life. Kneeling down before the kinghe touches the back of the royal hand with the back of his own, then snaps his fingers; after-wards he lays the palm of his hand on the palm of the king’s hand, then snaps his fingersagain. This ceremony is repeated four or five times, and averts the imminent danger of death.In Tonga it was believed that if any one fed himself with his own hands after touching thesacred person of a superior chief or anything that belonged to him, he would swell up anddie; the sanctity of the chief, like a virulent poison, infected the hands of his inferior, and,being communicated through them to the food, proved fatal to the eater. A commoner whohad incurred this danger could disinfect himself by performing a certain ceremony, which con-sisted in touching the sole of a chief’s foot with the palm and back of each of his hands, andafterwards rinsing his hands in water. If there was no water near, he rubbed his hands withthe juicy stem of a plantain or banana. After that he was free to feed himself with his ownhands without danger of being attacked by the malady which would otherwise follow from eat-ing with tabooed or sanctified hands. But until the ceremony of expiation or disinfection hadbeen performed, if he wished to eat he had either to get some one to feed him, or else to godown on his knees and pick up the food from the ground with his mouth like a beast. Hemight not even use a toothpick himself, but might guide the hand of another person holdingthe toothpick. The Tongans were subject to induration of the liver and certain forms of scrofu-la, which they often attributed to a failure to perform the requisite expiation after having inad-vertently touched a chief or his belongings. Hence they often went through the ceremony as aprecaution, without knowing that they had done anything to call for it. The king of Tonga couldnot refuse to play his part in the rite by presenting his foot to such as desired to touch it, evenwhen they applied to him at an inconvenient time. A fat unwieldy king, who perceived his sub-jects approaching with this intention, while he chanced to be taking his walks abroad, hasbeen sometimes seen to waddle as fast as his legs could carry him out of their way, in orderto escape the importunate and not wholly disinterested expression of their homage. If anyPage 162"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"one fancied he might have already unwittingly eaten with tabooed hands, he sat down beforethe chief, and, taking the chief’s foot, pressed it against his own stomach, that the food in hisbelly might not injure him, and that he might not swell up and die. Since scrofula was regard-ed by the Tongans as a result of eating with tabooed hands, we may conjecture that personswho suffered from it among them often resorted to the touch or pressure of the king’s foot asa cure for their malady. The analogy of the custom with the old English practice of bringingscrofulous patients to the king to be healed by his touch is sufficiently obvious, and suggests,as I have already pointed out elsewhere, that among our own remote ancestors scrofula mayhave obtained its name of the King’s Evil, from a belief, like that of the Tongans, that it wascaused as well as cured by contact with the divine majesty of kings.In New Zealand the dread of the sanctity of chiefs was at least as great as in Tonga. Theirghostly power, derived from an ancestral spirit, diffused itself by contagion over everythingthey touched, and could strike dead all who rashly or unwittingly meddled with it. Forinstance, it once happened that a New Zealand chief of high rank and great sanctity had leftthe remains of his dinner by the wayside. A slave, a stout, hungry fellow, coming up after thechief had gone, saw the unfinished dinner, and ate it up without asking questions. Hardly hadhe finished when he was informed by a horror-stricken spectator that the food of which hehad eaten was the chief’s. “I knew the unfortunate delinquent well. He was remarkable forcourage, and had signalised himself in the wars of the tribe,” but “no sooner did he hear thefatal news than he was seized by the most extraordinary convulsions and cramp in the stom-ach, which never ceased till he died, about sundown the same day. He was a strong man, inthe prime of life, and if any pakeha [European] freethinker should have said he was not killedby the tapu of the chief, which had been communicated to the food by contact, he would havebeen listened to with feelings of contempt for his ignorance and inability to understand plainand direct evidence.” This is not a solitary case. A Maori woman having eaten of some fruit,and being afterwards told that the fruit had been taken from a tabooed place, exclaimed thatthe spirit of the chief, whose sanctity had been thus profaned, would kill her. This was in theafternoon, and next day by twelve o’clock she was dead. A Maori chief’s tinder-box was oncethe means of killing several persons; for, having been lost by him, and found by some menwho used it to light their pipes, they died of fright on learning to whom it had belonged. So,too, the garments of a high New Zealand chief will kill any one else who wears them. A chiefwas observed by a missionary to throw down a precipice a blanket which he found too heavyto carry. Being asked by the missionary why he did not leave it on a tree for the use of afuture traveller, the chief replied that “it was the fear of its being taken by another whichcaused him to throw it where he did, for if it were worn, his tapu” (that is, his spiritual powercommunicated by contact to the blanket and through the blanket to the man) “would kill theperson.” For a similar reason a Maori chief would not blow a fire with his mouth; for hissacred breath would communicate its sanctity to the fire, which would pass it on to the pot onthe fire, which would pass it on to the meat in the pot, which would pass it on to the man whoate the meat, which was in the pot, which stood on the fire, which was breathed on by thechief; so that the eater, infected by the chief’s breath conveyed through these intermediaries,would surely die.Thus in the Polynesian race, to which the Maoris belong, superstition erected round the per-sons of sacred chiefs a real, though at the same time purely imaginary barrier, to transgresswhich actually entailed the death of the transgressor whenever he became aware of what hehad done. This fatal power of the imagination working through superstitious terrors is by nomeans confined to one race; it appears to be common among savages. For example, amongthe aborigines of Australia a native will die after the infliction of even the most superficialPage 163"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"wound, if only he believes that the weapon which inflicted the wound had been sung over andthus endowed with magical virtue. He simply lies down, refuses food, and pines away.Similarly among some of the Indian tribes of Brazil, if the medicine-man predicted the deathof any one who had offended him, “the wretch took to his hammock instantly in such fullexpectation of dying, that he would neither eat nor drink, and the prediction was a sentencewhich faith effectually executed.”2. MOURNERS TABOOEDThus regarding his sacred chiefs and kings as charged with a mysterious spiritual force whichso to say explodes at contact, the savage naturally ranks them among the dangerous classesof society, and imposes upon them the same sort of restraints that he lays on manslayers,menstruous women, and other persons whom he looks upon with a certain fear and horror.For example, sacred kings and priests in Polynesia were not allowed to touch food with theirhands, and had therefore to be fed by others; and as we have just seen, their vessels, gar-ments, and other property might not be used by others on pain of disease and death. Nowprecisely the same observances are exacted by some savages from girls at their first men-struation, women after childbirth, homicides, mourners, and all persons who have come intocontact with the dead. Thus, for example, to begin with the last class of persons, among theMaoris any one who had handled a corpse, helped to convey it to the grave, or touched adead man’s bones, was cut off from all intercourse and almost all communication withmankind. He could not enter any house, or come into contact with any person or thing, with-out utterly bedevilling them. He might not even touch food with his hands, which had becomeso frightfully tabooed or unclean as to be quite useless. Food would be set for him on theground, and he would then sit or kneel down, and, with his hands carefully held behind hisback, would gnaw at it as best he could. In some cases he would be fed by another person,who with outstretched arm contrived to do it without touching the tabooed man; but the feederwas himself subjected to many severe restrictions, little less onerous than those which wereimposed upon the other. In almost every populous village there lived a degraded wretch, thelowest of the low, who earned a sorry pittance by thus waiting upon the defiled. Clad in rags,daubed from head to foot with red ochre and stinking shark oil, always solitary and silent,generally old, haggard, and wizened, often half crazed, he might be seen sitting motionlessall day apart from the common path or thoroughfare of the village, gazing with lack-lustreeyes on the busy doings in which he might never take a part. Twice a day a dole of foodwould be thrown on the ground before him to munch as well as he could without the use ofhis hands; and at night, huddling his greasy tatters about him, he would crawl into some mis-erable lair of leaves and refuse, where, dirty, cold, and hungry, he passed, in broken ghost-haunted slumbers, a wretched night as a prelude to another wretched day. Such was the onlyhuman being deemed fit to associate at arm’s length with one who had paid the last offices ofrespect and friendship to the dead. And when, the dismal term of his seclusion being over,the mourner was about to mix with his fellows once more, all the dishes he had used in hisseclusion were diligently smashed, and all the garments he had worn were carefully thrownaway, lest they should spread the contagion of his defilement among others, just as the ves-sels and clothes of sacred kings and chiefs are destroyed or cast away for a similar reason.So complete in these respects is the analogy which the savage traces between the spiritualinfluences that emanate from divinities and from the dead, between the odour of sanctity andthe stench of corruption.The rule which forbids persons who have been in contact with the dead to touch food withtheir hands would seem to have been universal in Polynesia. Thus in Samoa “those whoPage 164"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"attended the deceased were most careful not to handle food, and for days were fed by othersas if they were helpless infants. Baldness and the loss of teeth were supposed to be the pun-ishment inflicted by the household god if they violated the rule.” Again, in Tonga, “no personcan touch a dead chief without being taboo’d for ten lunar months, except chiefs, who areonly taboo’d for three, four, or five months, according to the superiority of the dead chief;except again it be the body of Tooitonga [the great divine chief], and then even the greatestchief would be taboo’d ten months.... During the time a man is taboo’d he must not feed him-self with his own hands, but must be fed by somebody else: he must not even use a toothpickhimself, but must guide another person’s hand holding the toothpick. If he is hungry and thereis no one to feed him, he must go down upon his hands and knees, and pick up his victualswith his mouth: and if he infringes upon any of these rules, it is firmly expected that he willswell up and die.”Among the Shuswap of British Columbia widows and widowers in mourning are secluded andforbidden to touch their own head or body; the cups and cooking-vessels which they use maybe used by no one else. They must build a sweat-house beside a creek, sweat there all nightand bathe regularly, after which they must rub their bodies with branches of spruce. Thebranches may not be used more than once, and when they have served their purpose theyare stuck into the ground all round the hut. No hunter would come near such mourners, fortheir presence is unlucky. If their shadow were to fall on any one, he would be taken ill atonce. They employ thorn bushes for bed and pillow, in order to keep away the ghost of thedeceased; and thorn bushes are also laid all around their beds. This last precaution showsclearly what the spiritual danger is which leads to the exclusion of such persons from ordinarysociety; it is simply a fear of the ghost who is supposed to be hovering near them. In theMekeo district of British New Guinea a widower loses all his civil rights and becomes a socialoutcast, an object of fear and horror, shunned by all. He may not cultivate a garden, nor showhimself in public, nor traverse the village, nor walk on the roads and paths. Like a wild beasthe must skulk in the long grass and the bushes; and if he sees or hears any one coming,especially a woman, he must hide behind a tree or a thicket. If he wishes to fish or hunt, hemust do it alone and at night. If he would consult any one, even the missionary, he does soby stealth and at night; he seems to have lost his voice and speaks only in whispers. Were heto join a party of fishers or hunters, his presence would bring misfortune on them; the ghost ofhis dead wife would frighten away the fish or the game. He goes about everywhere and at alltimes armed with a tomahawk to defend himself, not only against wild boars in the jungle, butagainst the dreaded spirit of his departed spouse, who would do him an ill turn if she could;for all the souls of the dead are malignant and their only delight is to harm the living.3. WOMEN TABOOED AT MENSTRUATION AND CHILDBIRTHIn general, we may say that the prohibition to use the vessels, garments, and so forth of cer-tain persons, and the effects supposed to follow an infraction of the rule, are exactly the samewhether the persons to whom the things belong are sacred or what we might call uncleanand polluted. As the garments which have been touched by a sacred chief kill those who han-dle them, so do the things which have been touched by a menstruous women. An Australianblackfellow, who discovered that his wife had lain on his blanket at her menstrual period,killed her and died of terror himself within a fortnight. Hence Australian women at these timesare forbidden under pain of death to touch anything that men use, or even to walk on a paththat any man frequents. They are also secluded at childbirth, and all vessels used by themduring their seclusion are burned. In Uganda the pots which a woman touches, while theimpurity of childbirth or of menstruation is on her, should be destroyed; spears and shieldsPage 165"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"defiled by her touch are not destroyed, but only purified. “Among all the Déné and most otherAmerican tribes, hardly any other being was the object of so much dread as a menstruatingwoman. As soon as signs of that condition made themselves apparent in a young girl shewas carefully segregated from all but female company, and had to live by herself in a smallhut away from the gaze of the villagers or of the male members of the roving band. While inthat awful state, she had to abstain from touching anything belonging to man, or the spoils ofany venison or other animal, lest she would thereby pollute the same, and condemn thehunters to failure, owing to the anger of the game thus slighted. Dried fish formed her diet,and cold water, absorbed through a drinking tube, was her only beverage. Moreover, as thevery sight of her was dangerous to society, a special skin bonnet, with fringes falling over herface down to her breast, hid her from the public gaze, even some time after she had recov-ered her normal state.” Among the Bribri Indians of Costa Rica a menstruous woman isregarded as unclean. The only plates she may use for her food are banana leaves, which,when she has done with them, she throws away in some sequestered spot; for were a cow tofind them and eat them, the animal would waste away and perish. And she drinks out of aspecial vessel for a like reason; because if any one drank out of the same cup after her, hewould surely die.Among many peoples similar restrictions are imposed on women in childbed and apparentlyfor similar reasons; at such periods women are supposed to be in a dangerous conditionwhich would infect any person or thing they might touch; hence they are put into quarantineuntil, with the recovery of their health and strength, the imaginary danger has passed away.Thus, in Tahiti a woman after childbirth was secluded for a fortnight or three weeks in a tem-porary hut erected on sacred ground; during the time of her seclusion she was debarred fromtouching provisions, and had to be fed by another. Further, if any one else touched the childat this period, he was subjected to the same restrictions as the mother until the ceremony ofher purification had been performed. Similarly in the island of Kadiak, off Alaska, a womanabout to be delivered retires to a miserable low hovel built of reeds, where she must remainfor twenty days after the birth of her child, whatever the season may be, and she is consid-ered so unclean that no one will touch her, and food is reached to her on sticks. The BribriIndians regard the pollution of childbed as much more dangerous even than that of menstrua-tion. When a woman feels her time approaching, she informs her husband, who makes hasteto build a hut for her in a lonely spot. There she must live alone, holding no converse withanybody save her mother or another woman. After her delivery the medicine-man purifies herby breathing on her and laying an animal, it matters not what, upon her. But even this cere-mony only mitigates her uncleanness into a state considered to be equivalent to that of amenstruous woman; and for a full lunar month she must live apart from her housemates,observing the same rules with regard to eating and drinking as at her monthly periods. Thecase is still worse, the pollution is still more deadly, if she has had a miscarriage or has beendelivered of a stillborn child. In that case she may not go near a living soul: the mere contactwith things she has used is exceedingly dangerous: her food is handed to her at the end of along stick. This lasts generally for three weeks, after which she may go home, subject only tothe restrictions incident to an ordinary confinement.Some Bantu tribes entertain even more exaggerated notions of the virulent infection spreadby a woman who has had a miscarriage and has concealed it. An experienced observer ofthese people tells us that the blood of childbirth “appears to the eyes of the South Africans tobe tainted with a pollution still more dangerous than that of the menstrual fluid. The husbandis excluded from the hut for eight days of the lying-in period, chiefly from fear that he might becontaminated by this secretion. He dare not take his child in his arms for the three firstPage 166"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"months after the birth. But the secretion of childbed is particularly terrible when it is the prod-uct of a miscarriage, especially a concealed miscarriage. In this case it is not merely the manwho is threatened or killed, it is the whole country, it is the sky itself which suffers. By a curi-ous association of ideas a physiological fact causes cosmic troubles!” As for the disastrouseffect which a miscarriage may have on the whole country I will quote the words of a medi-cine-man and rain-maker of the Ba-Pedi tribe: “When a woman has had a miscarriage, whenshe has allowed her blood to flow, and has hidden the child, it is enough to cause the burningwinds to blow and to parch the country with heat. The rain no longer falls, for the country isno longer in order. When the rain approaches the place where the blood is, it will not dare toapproach. It will fear and remain at a distance. That woman has committed a great fault. Shehas spoiled the country of the chief, for she has hidden blood which had not yet been wellcongealed to fashion a man. That blood is taboo. It should never drip on the road! The chiefwill assemble his men and say to them, ‘Are you in order in your villages?’ Some one willanswer, ‘Such and such a woman was pregnant and we have not yet seen the child whichshe has given birth to.’ Then they go and arrest the woman. They say to her, ‘Show us whereyou have hidden it.’ They go and dig at the spot, they sprinkle the hole with a decoction oftwo sorts of roots prepared in a special pot. They take a little of the earth of this grave, theythrow it into the river, then they bring back water from the river and sprinkle it where she shedher blood. She herself must wash every day with the medicine. Then the country will be mois-tened again (by rain). Further, we (medicine-men), summon the women of the country; we tellthem to prepare a ball of the earth which contains the blood. They bring it to us one morning.If we wish to prepare medicine with which to sprinkle the whole country, we crumble this earthto powder; at the end of five days we send little boys and little girls, girls that yet know noth-ing of women’s affairs and have not yet had relations with men. We put the medicine in thehorns of oxen, and these children go to all the fords, to all the entrances of the country. A littlegirl turns up the soil with her mattock, the others dip a branch in the horn and sprinkle theinside of the hole saying, ‘Rain! rain!’ So we remove the misfortune which the women havebrought on the roads; the rain will be able to come. The country is purified!4. WARRIORS TABOOEDOnce more, warriors are conceived by the savage to move, so to say, in an atmosphere ofspiritual danger which constrains them to practise a variety of superstitious observances quitedifferent in their nature from those rational precautions which, as a matter of course, theyadopt against foes of flesh and blood. The general effect of these observances is to place thewarrior, both before and after victory, in the same state of seclusion or spiritual quarantine inwhich, for his own safety, primitive man puts his human gods and other dangerous charac-ters. Thus when the Maoris went out on the war-path they were sacred or taboo in the high-est degree, and they and their friends at home had to observe strictly many curious customsover and above the numerous taboos of ordinary life. They became, in the irreverent lan-guage of Europeans who knew them in the old fighting days, “tabooed an inch thick”; and asfor the leader of the expedition, he was quite unapproachable. Similarly, when the Israelitesmarched forth to war they were bound by certain rules of ceremonial purity identical with rulesobserved by Maoris and Australian blackfellows on the war-path. The vessels they used weresacred, and they had to practise continence and a custom of personal cleanliness of whichthe original motive, if we may judge from the avowed motive of savages who conform to thesame custom, was a fear lest the enemy should obtain the refuse of their persons, and thusbe enabled to work their destruction by magic. Among some Indian tribes of North America ayoung warrior in his first campaign had to conform to certain customs, of which two wereidentical with the observances imposed by the same Indians on girls at their first menstrua-Page 167"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"tion: the vessels he ate and drank out of might be touched by no other person, and he wasforbidden to scratch his head or any other part of his body with his fingers; if he could nothelp scratching himself, he had to do it with a stick. The latter rule, like the one which forbidsa tabooed person to feed himself with his own fingers, seems to rest on the supposed sancti-ty or pollution, whichever we choose to call it, of the tabooed hands. Moreover among theseIndian tribes the men on the war-path had always to sleep at night with their faces turnedtowards their own country; however uneasy the posture, they might not change it. They mightnot sit upon the bare ground, nor wet their feet, nor walk on a beaten path if they could helpit; when they had no choice but to walk on a path, they sought to counteract the ill effect ofdoing so by doctoring their legs with certain medicines or charms which they carried withthem for the purpose. No member of the party was permitted to step over the legs, hands, orbody of any other member who chanced to be sitting or lying on the ground; and it was equal-ly forbidden to step over his blanket, gun, tomahawk, or anything that belonged to him. If thisrule was inadvertently broken, it became the duty of the member whose person or propertyhad been stepped over to knock the other member down, and it was similarly the duty of thatother to be knocked down peaceably and without resistance. The vessels out of which thewarriors ate their food were commonly small bowls of wood or birch bark, with marks to distin-guish the two sides; in marching from home the Indians invariably drank out of one side of thebowl, and in returning they drank out of the other. When on their way home they came withina day’s march of the village, they hung up all their bowls on trees, or threw them away on theprairie, doubtless to prevent their sanctity or defilement from being communicated with disas-trous effects to their friends, just as we have seen that the vessels and clothes of the sacredMikado, of women at childbirth and menstruation, and of persons defiled by contact with thedead are destroyed or laid aside for a similar reason. The first four times that an ApacheIndian goes out on the war-path, he is bound to refrain from scratching his head with his fin-gers and from letting water touch his lips. Hence he scratches his head with a stick, anddrinks through a hollow reed or cane. Stick and reed are attached to the warrior’s belt and toeach other by a leathern thong. The rule not to scratch their heads with their fingers, but touse a stick for the purpose instead, was regularly observed by Ojebways on the war-path.With regard to the Creek Indians and kindred tribes we are told they “will not cohabit withwomen while they are out at war; they religiously abstain from every kind of intercourse evenwith their own wives, for the space of three days and nights before they go to war, and soafter they return home, because they are to sanctify themselves.” Among the Ba-Pedi andBa-Thonga tribes of South Africa not only have the warriors to abstain from women, but thepeople left behind in the villages are also bound to continence; they think that any inconti-nence on their part would cause thorns to grow on the ground traversed by the warriors, andthat success would not attend the expedition.Why exactly many savages have made it a rule to refrain from women in time of war, we can-not say for certain, but we may conjecture that their motive was a superstitious fear lest, onthe principles of sympathetic magic, close contact with women should infect them with femi-nine weakness and cowardice. Similarly some savages imagine that contact with a woman inchildbed enervates warriors and enfeebles their weapons. Indeed the Kayans of CentralBorneo go so far as to hold that to touch a loom or women’s clothes would so weaken a manthat he would have no success in hunting, fishing, and war. Hence it is not merely sexualintercourse with women that the savage warrior sometimes shuns; he is careful to avoid thesex altogether. Thus among the hill tribes of Assam, not only are men forbidden to cohabitwith their wives during or after a raid, but they may not eat food cooked by a woman; nay,they should not address a word even to their own wives. Once a woman, who unwittinglyPage 168"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"broke the rule by speaking to her husband while he was under the war taboo, sickened anddied when she learned the awful crime she had committed.5. MANSLAYERS TABOOEDIf the reader still doubts whether the rules of conduct which we have just been consideringare based on superstitious fears or dictated by a rational prudence, his doubts will probablybe dissipated when he learns that rules of the same sort are often imposed even more strin-gently on warriors after the victory has been won and when all fear of the living corporeal foeis at an end. In such cases one motive for the inconvenient restrictions laid on the victors intheir hour of triumph is probably a dread of the angry ghosts of the slain; and that the fear ofthe vengeful ghosts does influence the behaviour of the slayers is often expressly affirmed.The general effect of the taboos laid on sacred chiefs, mourners, women at childbirth, men onthe war-path, and so on, is to seclude or isolate the tabooed persons from ordinary society,this effect being attained by a variety of rules, which oblige the men or women to live in sepa-rate huts or in the open air, to shun the commerce of the sexes, to avoid the use of vesselsemployed by others, and so forth. Now the same effect is produced by similar means in thecase of victorious warriors, particularly such as have actually shed the blood of their enemies.In the island of Timor, when a warlike expedition has returned in triumph bringing the headsof the vanquished foe, the leader of the expedition is forbidden by religion and custom toreturn at once to his own house. A special hut is prepared for him, in which he has to residefor two months, undergoing bodily and spiritual purification. During this time he may not go tohis wife nor feed himself; the food must be put into his mouth by another person. That theseobservances are dictated by fear of the ghosts of the slain seems certain; for from anotheraccount of the ceremonies performed on the return of a successful head-hunter in the sameisland we learn that sacrifices are offered on this occasion to appease the soul of the manwhose head has been taken; the people think that some misfortune would befall the victorwere such offerings omitted. Moreover, a part of the ceremony consists of a dance accompa-nied by a song, in which the death of the slain man is lamented and his forgiveness isentreated. “Be not angry,” they say, “because your head is here with us; had we been lesslucky, our heads might now have been exposed in your village. We have offered the sacrificeto appease you. Your spirit may now rest and leave us at peace. Why were you our enemy?Would it not have been better that we should remain friends? Then your blood would nothave been spilt and your head would not have been cut off.” The people of Paloo in CentralCelebes take the heads of their enemies in war and afterwards propitiate the souls of theslain in the temple.Among the tribes at the mouth of the Wanigela River, in New Guinea, “a man who has takenlife is considered to be impure until he has undergone certain ceremonies: as soon as possi-ble after the deed he cleanses himself and his weapon. This satisfactorily accomplished, herepairs to his village and seats himself on the logs of sacrificial staging. No one approacheshim or takes any notice whatever of him. A house is prepared for him which is put in chargeof two or three small boys as servants. He may eat only toasted bananas, and only the centreportion of them—the ends being thrown away. On the third day of his seclusion a small feastis prepared by his friends, who also fashion some new perineal bands for him. This is calledivi poro. The next day the man dons all his best ornaments and badges for taking life, andsallies forth fully armed and parades the village. The next day a hunt is organised, and a kan-garoo selected from the game captured. It is cut open and the spleen and liver rubbed overthe back of the man. He then walks solemnly down to the nearest water, and standing strad-dle-legs in it washes himself. All the young untried warriors swim between his legs. This isPage 169"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"supposed to impart courage and strength to them. The following day, at early dawn, he dash-es out of his house, fully armed, and calls aloud the name of his victim. Having satisfied him-self that he has thoroughly scared the ghost of the dead man, he returns to his house. Thebeating of flooring-boards and the lighting of fires is also a certain method of scaring theghost. A day later his purification is finished. He can then enter his wife’s house.”In Windessi, Dutch New Guinea, when a party of head-hunters has been successful, and theyare nearing home, they announce their approach and success by blowing on triton shells.Their canoes are also decked with branches. The faces of the men who have taken a headare blackened with charcoal. If several have taken part in killing the same victim, his head isdivided among them. They always time their arrival so as to reach home in the early morning.They come rowing to the village with a great noise, and the women stand ready to dance inthe verandahs of the houses. The canoes row past the room sram or house where the youngmen live; and as they pass, the murderers throw as many pointed sticks or bamboos at thewall or the roof as there were enemies killed. The day is spent very quietly. Now and thenthey drum or blow on the conch; at other times they beat the walls of the houses with loudshouts to drive away the ghosts of the slain. So the Yabim of New Guinea believe that thespirit of a murdered man pursues his murderer and seeks to do him a mischief. Hence theydrive away the spirit with shouts and the beating of drums. When the Fijians had buried aman alive, as they often did, they used at nightfall to make a great uproar by means of bam-boos, trumpet-shells, and so forth, for the purpose of frightening away his ghost, lest heshould attempt to return to his old home. And to render his house unattractive to him they dis-mantled it and clothed it with everything that to their ideas seemed most repulsive. On theevening of the day on which they had tortured a prisoner to death, the American Indians werewont to run through the village with hideous yells, beating with sticks on the furniture, thewalls, and the roofs of the huts to prevent the angry ghost of their victim from settling thereand taking vengeance for the torments that his body had endured at their hands. “Once,”says a traveller, “on approaching in the night a village of Ottawas, I found all the inhabitants inconfusion: they were all busily engaged in raising noises of the loudest and most inharmo-nious kind. Upon inquiry, I found that a battle had been lately fought between the Ottawasand the Kickapoos, and that the object of all this noise was to prevent the ghosts of thedeparted combatants from entering the village.”Among the Basutos “ablution is specially performed on return from battle. It is absolutely nec-essary that the warriors should rid themselves, as soon as possible, of the blood they haveshed, or the shades of their victims would pursue them incessantly, and disturb their slum-bers. They go in a procession, and in full armour, to the nearest stream. At the moment theyenter the water a diviner, placed higher up, throws some purifying substances into the cur-rent. This is, however, not strictly necessary. The javelins and battle-axes also undergo theprocess of washing.” Among the Bageshu of East Africa a man who has killed another maynot return to his own house on the same day, though he may enter the village and spend thenight in a friend’s house. He kills a sheep and smears his chest, his right arm, and his headwith the contents of the animal’s stomach. His children are brought to him and he smearsthem in like manner. Then he smears each side of the doorway with the tripe and entrails,and finally throws the rest of the stomach on the roof of his house. For a whole day he maynot touch food with his hands, but picks it up with two sticks and so conveys it to his mouth.His wife is not under any such restrictions. She may even go to mourn for the man whom herhusband has killed, if she wishes to do so. Among the Angoni, to the north of the Zambesi,warriors who have slain foes on an expedition smear their bodies and faces with ashes, hanggarments of their victims on their persons, and tie bark ropes round their necks, so that thePage 170"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"ends hang down over their shoulders or breasts. This costume they wear for three days aftertheir return, and rising at break of day they run through the village uttering frightful yells todrive away the ghosts of the slain, which, if they were not thus banished from the houses,might bring sickness and misfortune on the inmates.In some of these accounts nothing is said of an enforced seclusion, at least after the ceremo-nial cleansing, but some South African tribes certainly require the slayer of a very gallant foein war to keep apart from his wife and family for ten days after he has washed his body inrunning water. He also receives from the tribal doctor a medicine which he chews with hisfood. When a Nandi of East Africa has killed a member of another tribe, he paints one side ofhis body, spear, and sword red, and the other side white. For four days after the slaughter heis considered unclean and may not go home. He has to build a small shelter by a river andlive there; he may not associate with his wife or sweetheart, and he may eat nothing but por-ridge, beef, and goat’s flesh. At the end of the fourth day he must purify himself by taking astrong purge made from the bark of the segetet tree and by drinking goat’s milk mixed withblood. Among the Bantu tribes of Kavirondo, when a man has killed an enemy in warfare heshaves his head on his return home, and his friends rub a medicine, which generally consistsof goat’s dung, over his body to prevent the spirit of the slain man from troubling him. Exactlythe same custom is practised for the same reason by the Wageia of East Africa. With the Ja-Luo of Kavirondo the custom is somewhat different. Three days after his return from the fightthe warrior shaves his head. But before he may enter his village he has to hang a live fowl,head uppermost, round his neck; then the bird is decapitated and its head left hanging roundhis neck. Soon after his return a feast is made for the slain man, in order that his ghost maynot haunt his slayer. In the Pelew Islands, when the men return from a warlike expedition inwhich they have taken a life, the young warriors who have been out fighting for the first time,and all who handled the slain, are shut up in the large council-house and become tabooed.They may not quit the edifice, nor bathe, nor touch a woman, nor eat fish; their food is limitedto coco-nuts and syrup. They rub themselves with charmed leaves and chew charmed betel.After three days they go together to bathe as near as possible to the spot where the man waskilled.Among the Natchez Indians of North America young braves who had taken their first scalpswere obliged to observe certain rules of abstinence for six months. They might not sleep withtheir wives nor eat flesh; their only food was fish and hasty-pudding. If they broke these rules,they believed that the soul of the man they had killed would work their death by magic, thatthey would gain no more successes over the enemy, and that the least wound inflicted onthem would prove mortal. When a Choctaw had killed an enemy and taken his scalp, he wentinto mourning for a month, during which he might not comb his hair, and if his head itched hemight not scratch it except with a little stick which he wore fastened to his wrist for the pur-pose. This ceremonial mourning for the enemies they had slain was not uncommon amongthe North American Indians.Thus we see that warriors who have taken the life of a foe in battle are temporarily cut offfrom free intercourse with their fellows, and especially with their wives, and must undergo cer-tain rites of purification before they are readmitted to society. Now if the purpose of theirseclusion and of the expiatory rites which they have to perform is, as we have been led tobelieve, no other than to shake off, frighten, or appease the angry spirit of the slain man, wemay safely conjecture that the similar purification of homicides and murderers, who haveimbrued their hands in the blood of a fellow-tribesman, had at first the same significance, andthat the idea of a moral or spiritual regeneration symbolised by the washing, the fasting, andPage 171"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"so on, was merely a later interpretation put upon the old custom by men who had outgrownthe primitive modes of thought in which the custom originated. The conjecture will be con-firmed if we can show that savages have actually imposed certain restrictions on the murder-er of a fellow-tribesman from a definite fear that he is haunted by the ghost of his victim. Thiswe can do with regard to the Omahas of North America. Among these Indians the kinsmen ofa murdered man had the right to put the murderer to death, but sometimes they waived theirright in consideration of presents which they consented to accept. When the life of the mur-derer was spared, he had to observe certain stringent rules for a period which varied fromtwo to four years. He must walk barefoot, and he might eat no warm food, nor raise his voice,nor look around. He was compelled to pull his robe about him and to have it tied at the neckeven in hot weather; he might not let it hang loose or fly open. He might not move his handsabout, but had to keep them close to his body. He might not comb his hair, and it might not beblown about by the wind. When the tribe went out hunting, he was obliged to pitch his tentabout a quarter of mile from the rest of the people “lest the ghost of his victim should raise ahigh wind, which might cause damage.” Only one of his kindred was allowed to remain withhim at his tent. No one wished to eat with him, for they said, “If we eat with him whomWakanda hates, Wakanda will hate us.” Sometimes he wandered at night crying and lament-ing his offence. At the end of his long isolation the kinsmen of the murdered man heard hiscrying and said, “It is enough. Begone, and walk among the crowd. Put on moccasins andwear a good robe.” Here the reason alleged for keeping the murderer at a considerable dis-tance from the hunters gives the clue to all the other restrictions laid on him: he was hauntedand therefore dangerous. The ancient Greeks believed that the soul of a man who had justbeen killed was wroth with his slayer and troubled him; wherefore it was needful even for theinvoluntary homicide to depart from his country for a year until the anger of the dead man hadcooled down; nor might the slayer return until sacrifice had been offered and ceremonies ofpurification performed. If his victim chanced to be a foreigner, the homicide had to shun thenative country of the dead man as well as his own. The legend of the matricide Orestes, howhe roamed from place to place pursued by the Furies of his murdered mother, and nonewould sit at meat with him, or take him in, till he had been purified, reflects faithfully the realGreek dread of such as were still haunted by an angry ghost.6. HUNTERS AND FISHERS TABOOEDIn savage society the hunter and the fisherman have often to observe rules of abstinence andto submit to ceremonies of purification of the same sort as those which are obligatory on thewarrior and the manslayer; and though we cannot in all cases perceive the exact purposewhich these rules and ceremonies are supposed to serve, we may with some probabilityassume that, just as the dread of the spirits of his enemies is the main motive for the seclu-sion and purification of the warrior who hopes to take or has already taken their lives, so thehuntsman or fisherman who complies with similar customs is principally actuated by a fear ofthe spirits of the beasts, birds, or fish which he has killed or intends to kill. For the savagecommonly conceives animals to be endowed with souls and intelligences like his own, andhence he naturally treats them with similar respect. Just as he attempts to appease theghosts of the men he has slain, so he essays to propitiate the spirits of the animals he haskilled. These ceremonies of propitiation will be described later on in this work; here we haveto deal, first, with the taboos observed by the hunter and the fisherman before or during thehunting and fishing seasons, and, second, with the ceremonies of purification which have tobe practised by these men on returning with their booty from a successful chase.While the savage respects, more or less, the souls of all animals, he treats with particular def-Page 172"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"erence the spirits of such as are either especially useful to him or formidable on account oftheir size, strength, or ferocity. Accordingly the hunting and killing of these valuable or danger-ous beasts are subject to more elaborate rules and ceremonies than the slaughter of compar-atively useless and insignificant creatures. Thus the Indians of Nootka Sound prepared them-selves for catching whales by observing a fast for a week, during which they ate very little,bathed in the water several times a day, sang, and rubbed their bodies, limbs, and faces withshells and bushes till they looked as if they had been severely torn with briars. They werelikewise required to abstain from any commerce with their women for the like period, this lastcondition being considered indispensable to their success. A chief who failed to catch a whalehas been known to attribute his failure to a breach of chastity on the part of his men. It shouldbe remarked that the conduct thus prescribed as a preparation for whaling is precisely thatwhich in the same tribe of Indians was required of men about to go on the war-path. Rules ofthe same sort are, or were formerly, observed by Malagasy whalers. For eight days beforethey went to sea the crew of a whaler used to fast, abstaining from women and liquor, andconfessing their most secret faults to each other; and if any man was found to have sinneddeeply, he was forbidden to share in the expedition. In the island of Mabuiag continence wasimposed on the people both before they went to hunt the dugong and while the turtles werepairing. The turtle-season lasts during parts of October and November; and if at that timeunmarried persons had sexual intercourse with each other, it was believed that when thecanoe approached the floating turtle, the male would separate from the female and bothwould dive down in different directions. So at Mowat in New Guinea men have no relationwith women when the turtles are coupling, though there is considerable laxity of morals atother times. In the island of Uap, one of the Caroline group, every fisherman plying his craftlies under a most strict taboo during the whole of the fishing season, which lasts for six oreight weeks. Whenever he is on shore he must spend all his time in the men’s clubhouse,and under no pretext whatever may he visit his own house or so much as look upon the facesof his wife and womenkind. Were he but to steal a glance at them, they think that flying fishmust inevitably bore out his eyes at night. If his wife, mother, or daughter brings any gift forhim or wishes to talk with him, she must stand down towards the shore with her back turnedto the men’s clubhouse. Then the fisherman may go out and speak to her, or with his backturned to her he may receive what she has brought him; after which he must return at once tohis rigorous confinement. Indeed the fishermen may not even join in dance and song with theother men of the clubhouse in the evening; they must keep to themselves and be silent. InMirzapur, when the seed of the silkworm is brought into the house, the Kol or Bhuiyar puts itin a place which has been carefully plastered with holy cowdung to bring good luck. From thattime the owner must be careful to avoid ceremonial impurity. He must give up cohabitationwith his wife; he may not sleep on a bed, nor shave himself, nor cut his nails, nor anoint him-self with oil, nor eat food cooked with butter, nor tell lies, nor do anything else that he deemswrong. He vows to Singarmati Devi that, if the worms are duly born, he will make her an offer-ing. When the cocoons open and the worms appear, he assembles the women of the houseand they sing the same song as at the birth of a baby, and red lead is smeared on the partingof the hair of all the married women of the neighbourhood. When the worms pair, rejoicingsare made as at a marriage. Thus the silkworms are treated as far as possible like humanbeings. Hence the custom which prohibits the commerce of the sexes while the worms arehatching may be only an extension, by analogy, of the rule which is observed by many races,that the husband may not cohabit with his wife during pregnancy and lactation.In the island of Nias the hunters sometimes dig pits, cover them lightly over with twigs, grass,and leaves, and then drive the game into them. While they are engaged in digging the pits,they have to observe a number of taboos. They may not spit, or the game would turn back inPage 173"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"disgust from the pits. They may not laugh, or the sides of the pit would fall in. They may eatno salt, prepare no fodder for swine, and in the pit they may not scratch themselves, for ifthey did, the earth would be loosened and would collapse. And the night after digging the pitthey may have no intercourse with a woman, or all their labour would be in vain.This practice of observing strict chastity as a condition of success in hunting and fishing isvery common among rude races; and the instances of it which have been cited render it prob-able that the rule is always based on a superstition rather than on a consideration of the tem-porary weakness which a breach of the custom may entail on the hunter or fisherman. In gen-eral it appears to be supposed that the evil effect of incontinence is not so much that it weak-ens him, as that, for some reason or other, it offends the animals, who in consequence willnot suffer themselves to be caught. A Carrier Indian of British Columbia used to separate fromhis wife for a full month before he set traps for bears, and during this time he might not drinkfrom the same vessel as his wife, but had to use a special cup made of birch bark. The neg-lect of these precautions would cause the game to escape after it had been snared. But whenhe was about to snare martens, the period of continence was cut down to ten days.An examination of all the many cases in which the savage bridles his passions and remainschaste from motives of superstition, would be instructive, but I cannot attempt it now. I willonly add a few miscellaneous examples of the custom before passing to the ceremonies ofpurification which are observed by the hunter and fisherman after the chase and the fishingare over. The workers in the salt-pans near Siphoum, in Laos, must abstain from all sexualrelations at the place where they are at work; and they may not cover their heads nor shelterthemselves under an umbrella from the burning rays of the sun. Among the Kachins of Burmathe ferment used in making beer is prepared by two women, chosen by lot, who during thethree days that the process lasts may eat nothing acid and may have no conjugal relationswith their husbands; otherwise it is supposed that the beer would be sour. Among the Masaihoney-wine is brewed by a man and a woman who live in a hut set apart for them till the wineis ready for drinking. But they are strictly forbidden to have sexual intercourse with each otherduring this time; it is deemed essential that they should be chaste for two days before theybegin to brew and for the whole of the six days that the brewing lasts. The Masai believe thatwere the couple to commit a breach of chastity, not only would the wine be undrinkable butthe bees which made the honey would fly away. Similarly they require that a man who is mak-ing poison should sleep alone and observe other taboos which render him almost an outcast.The Wandorobbo, a tribe of the same region as the Masai, believe that the mere presence ofa woman in the neighbourhood of a man who is brewing poison would deprive the poison ofits venom, and that the same thing would happen if the wife of the poison-maker were tocommit adultery while her husband was brewing the poison. In this last case it is obvious thata rationalistic explanation of the taboo is impossible. How could the loss of virtue in the poi-son be a physical consequence of the loss of virtue in the poison-maker’s wife? Clearly theeffect which the wife’s adultery is supposed to have on the poison is a case of sympatheticmagic; her misconduct sympathetically affects her husband and his work at a distance. Wemay, accordingly, infer with some confidence that the rule of continence imposed on the poi-son-maker himself is also a simple case of sympathetic magic, and not, as a civilised readermight be disposed to conjecture, a wise precaution designed to prevent him from accidentallypoisoning his wife.Among the Ba-Pedi and Ba-Thonga tribes of South Africa, when the site of a new village hasbeen chosen and the houses are building, all the married people are forbidden to have conju-gal relations with each other. If it were discovered that any couple had broken this rule, thePage 174"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"work of building would immediately be stopped, and another site chosen for the village. Forthey think that a breach of chastity would spoil the village which was growing up, that thechief would grow lean and perhaps die, and that the guilty woman would never bear anotherchild. Among the Chams of Cochin-China, when a dam is made or repaired on a river for thesake of irrigation, the chief who offers the traditional sacrifices and implores the protection ofthe deities on the work has to stay all the time in a wretched hovel of straw, taking no part inthe labour, and observing the strictest continence; for the people believe that a breach of hischastity would entail a breach of the dam. Here, it is plain, there can be no idea of maintain-ing the mere bodily vigour of the chief for the accomplishment of a task in which he does noteven bear a hand.If the taboos or abstinences observed by hunters and fishermen before and during the chaseare dictated, as we have seen reason to believe, by superstitious motives, and chiefly by adread of offending or frightening the spirits of the creatures whom it is proposed to kill, wemay expect that the restraints imposed after the slaughter has been perpetrated will be atleast as stringent, the slayer and his friends having now the added fear of the angry ghosts ofhis victims before their eyes. Whereas on the hypothesis that the abstinences in question,including those from food, drink, and sleep, are merely salutary precautions for maintainingthe men in health and strength to do their work, it is obvious that the observance of theseabstinences or taboos after the work is done, that is, when the game is killed and the fishcaught, must be wholly superfluous, absurd, and inexplicable. But as I shall now show, thesetaboos often continue to be enforced or even increased in stringency after the death of theanimals, in other words, after the hunter or fisher has accomplished his object by making hisbag or landing his fish. The rationalistic theory of them therefore breaks down entirely; thehypothesis of superstition is clearly the only one open to us.Among the Inuit or Esquimaux of Bering Strait “the dead bodies of various animals must betreated very carefully by the hunter who obtains them, so that their shades may not be offend-ed and bring bad luck or even death upon him or his people.” Hence the Unalit hunter whohas had a hand in the killing of a white whale, or even has helped to take one from the net, isnot allowed to do any work for the next four days, that being the time during which the shadeor ghost of the whale is supposed to stay with its body. At the same time no one in the villagemay use any sharp or pointed instrument for fear of wounding the whale’s shade, which isbelieved to be hovering invisible in the neighbourhood; and no loud noise may be made lest itshould frighten or offend the ghost. Whoever cuts a whale’s body with an iron axe will die.Indeed the use of all iron instruments is forbidden in the village during these four days.These same Esquimaux celebrate a great annual festival in December when the bladders ofall the seals, whales, walrus, and white bears that have been killed in the year are taken intothe assembly-house of the village. They remain there for several days, and so long as theydo so the hunters avoid all intercourse with women, saying that if they failed in that respectthe shades of the dead animals would be offended. Similarly among the Aleuts of Alaska thehunter who had struck a whale with a charmed spear would not throw again, but returned atonce to his home and separated himself from his people in a hut specially constructed for thepurpose, where he stayed for three days without food or drink, and without touching or look-ing upon a woman. During this time of seclusion he snorted occasionally in imitation of thewounded and dying whale, in order to prevent the whale which he had struck from leaving thecoast. On the fourth day he emerged from his seclusion and bathed in the sea, shrieking in ahoarse voice and beating the water with his hands. Then, taking with him a companion, herepaired to that part of the shore where he expected to find the whale stranded. If the beastPage 175"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"was dead, he at once cut out the place where the death-wound had been inflicted. If thewhale was not dead, he again returned to his home and continued washing himself until thewhale died. Here the hunter’s imitation of the wounded whale is probably intended by meansof homoeopathic magic to make the beast die in earnest. Once more the soul of the grimpolar bear is offended if the taboos which concern him are not observed. His soul tarries forthree days near the spot where it left his body, and during these days the Esquimaux are par-ticularly careful to conform rigidly to the laws of taboo, because they believe that punishmentovertakes the transgressor who sins against the soul of a bear far more speedily than himwho sins against the souls of the sea-beasts.When the Kayans have shot one of the dreaded Bornean panthers, they are very anxiousabout the safety of their souls, for they think that the soul of a panther is almost more power-ful than their own. Hence they step eight times over the carcase of the dead beast reciting thespell, “Panther, thy soul under my soul.” On returning home they smear themselves, theirdogs, and their weapons with the blood of fowls in order to calm their souls and hinder themfrom fleeing away; for, being themselves fond of the flesh of fowls, they ascribe the sametaste to their souls. For eight days afterwards they must bathe by day and by night beforegoing out again to the chase. Among the Hottentots, when a man has killed a lion, leopard,elephant, or rhinoceros, he is esteemed a great hero, but he has to remain at home quite idlefor three days, during which his wife may not come near him; she is also enjoined to restrictherself to a poor diet and to eat no more than is barely necessary to keep her in health.Similarly the Lapps deem it the height of glory to kill a bear, which they consider the king ofbeasts. Nevertheless, all the men who take part in the slaughter are regarded as unclean,and must live by themselves for three days in a hut or tent made specially for them, wherethey cut up and cook the bear’s carcase. The reindeer which brought in the carcase on asledge may not be driven by a woman for a whole year; indeed, according to one account, itmay not be used by anybody for that period. Before the men go into the tent where they areto be secluded, they strip themselves of the garments they had worn in killing the bear, andtheir wives spit the red juice of alder bark in their faces. They enter the tent not by the ordi-nary door but by an opening at the back. When the bear’s flesh has been cooked, a portion ofit is sent by the hands of two men to the women, who may not approach the men’s tent whilethe cooking is going on. The men who convey the flesh to the women pretend to be strangersbringing presents from a foreign land; the women keep up the pretence and promise to tie redthreads round the legs of the strangers. The bear’s flesh may not be passed in to the womenthrough the door of their tent, but must be thrust in at a special opening made by lifting up thehem of the tent-cover. When the three days’ seclusion is over and the men are at liberty toreturn to their wives, they run, one after the other, round the fire, holding the chain by whichpots are suspended over it. This is regarded as a form of purification; they may now leave thetent by the ordinary door and rejoin the women. But the leader of the party must still abstainfrom cohabitation with his wife for two days more.Again, the Caffres are said to dread greatly the boa-constrictor or an enormous serpentresembling it; “and being influenced by certain superstitious notions they even fear to kill it.The man who happened to put it to death, whether in self-defence or otherwise, was formerlyrequired to lie in a running stream of water during the day for several weeks together; and nobeast whatever was allowed to be slaughtered at the hamlet to which he belonged, until thisduty had been fully performed. The body of the snake was then taken and carefully buried ina trench, dug close to the cattle-fold, where its remains, like those of a chief, were hencefor-ward kept perfectly undisturbed. The period of penance, as in the case of mourning for thedead, is now happily reduced to a few days.” In Madras it is considered a great sin to kill aPage 176"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"cobra. When this has happened, the people generally burn the body of the serpent, just asthey burn the bodies of human beings. The murderer deems himself polluted for three days.On the second day milk is poured on the remains of the cobra. On the third day the guiltywretch is free from pollution.In these last cases the animal whose slaughter has to be atoned for is sacred, that is, it isone whose life is commonly spared from motives of superstition. Yet the treatment of the sac-rilegious slayer seems to resemble so closely the treatment of hunters and fishermen whohave killed animals for food in the ordinary course of business, that the ideas on which bothsets of customs are based may be assumed to be substantially the same. Those ideas, if Iam right, are the respect which the savage feels for the souls of beasts, especially valuableor formidable beasts, and the dread which he entertains of their vengeful ghosts. Some con-firmation of this view may be drawn from the ceremonies observed by fishermen of Annamwhen the carcase of a whale is washed ashore. These fisherfolk, we are told, worship thewhale on account of the benefits they derive from it. There is hardly a village on the sea-shore which has not its small pagoda, containing the bones, more or less authentic, of awhale. When a dead whale is washed ashore, the people accord it a solemn burial. The manwho first caught sight of it acts as chief mourner, performing the rites which as chief mournerand heir he would perform for a human kinsman. He puts on all the garb of woe, the strawhat, the white robe with long sleeves turned inside out, and the other paraphernalia of fullmourning. As next of kin to the deceased he presides over the funeral rites. Perfumes areburned, sticks of incense kindled, leaves of gold and silver scattered, crackers let off. Whenthe flesh has been cut off and the oil extracted, the remains of the carcase are buried in thesand. After wards a shed is set up and offerings are made in it. Usually some time after theburial the spirit of the dead whale takes possession of some person in the village anddeclares by his mouth whether he is a male or a female.Chapter XXITabooed Things1. THE MEANING OF TABOOTHUS in primitive society the rules of ceremonial purity observed by divine kings, chiefs, andpriests agree in many respects with the rules observed by homicides, mourners, women inchildbed, girls at puberty, hunters and fishermen, and so on. To us these various classes ofpersons appear to differ totally in character and condition; some of them we should call holy,others we might pronounce unclean and polluted. But the savage makes no such moral dis-tinction between them; the conceptions of holiness and pollution are not yet differentiated inhis mind. To him the common feature of all these persons is that they are dangerous and indanger, and the danger in which they stand and to which they expose others is what weshould call spiritual or ghostly, and therefore imaginary. The danger, however, is not less realbecause it is imaginary; imagination acts upon man as really as does gravitation, and may killhim as certainly as a dose of prussic acid. To seclude these persons from the rest of theworld so that the dreaded spiritual danger shall neither reach them nor spread from them, isthe object of the taboos which they have to observe. These taboos act, so to say, as electricalinsulators to preserve the spiritual force with which these persons are charged from sufferingor inflicting harm by contact with the outer world.To the illustrations of these general principles which have been already given I shall now addsome more, drawing my examples, first, from the class of tabooed things, and, second, fromPage 177"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"the class of tabooed words; for in the opinion of the savage both things and words may, likepersons, be charged or electrified, either temporarily or permanently, with the mysteriousvirtue of taboo, and may therefore require to be banished for a longer or shorter time from thefamiliar usage of common life. And the examples will be chosen with special reference tothose sacred chiefs, kings and priests, who, more than anybody else, live fenced about bytaboo as by a wall. Tabooed things will be illustrated in the present chapter, and tabooedwords in the next.2. IRON TABOOEDIn the first place we may observe that the awful sanctity of kings naturally leads to a prohibi-tion to touch their sacred persons. Thus it was unlawful to lay hands on the person of aSpartan king: no one might touch the body of the king or queen of Tahiti: it is forbidden totouch the person of the king of Siam under pain of death; and no one may touch the king ofCambodia, for any purpose whatever, without his express command. In July 1874 the kingwas thrown from his carriage and lay insensible on the ground, but not one of his suite daredto touch him; a European coming to the spot carried the injured monarch to his palace.Formerly no one might touch the king of Corea; and if he deigned to touch a subject, the spottouched became sacred, and the person thus honoured had to wear a visible mark (generallya cord of red silk) for the rest of his life. Above all, no iron might touch the king’s body. In1800 King Tieng-tsong-tai-oang died of a tumour in the back, no one dreaming of employingthe lancet, which would probably have saved his life. It is said that one king suffered terriblyfrom an abscess in the lip, till his physician called in a jester, whose pranks made the kinglaugh heartily, and so the abscess burst. Roman and Sabine priests might not be shaved withiron but only with bronze razors or shears; and whenever an iron graving-tool was broughtinto the sacred grove of the Arval Brothers at Rome for the purpose of cutting an inscription instone, an expiatory sacrifice of a lamb and a pig must be offered, which was repeated whenthe graving-tool was removed from the grove. As a general rule iron might not be brought intoGreek sanctuaries. In Crete sacrifices were offered to Menedemus without the use of iron,because the legend ran that Menedemus had been killed by an iron weapon in the Trojanwar. The Archon of Plataea might not touch iron; but once a year, at the annual commemora-tion of the men who fell at the battle of Plataea, he was allowed to carry a sword wherewith tosacrifice a bull. To this day a Hottentot priest never uses an iron knife, but always a sharpsplint of quartz, in sacrificing an animal or circumcising a lad. Among the Ovambo of South-west Africa custom requires that lads should be circumcised with a sharp flint; if none is tohand, the operation may be performed with iron, but the iron must afterwards be buried.Amongst the Moquis of Arizona stone knives, hatchets, and so on have passed out of com-mon use, but are retained in religious ceremonies. After the Pawnees had ceased to usestone arrow-heads for ordinary purposes, they still employed them to slay the sacrifices,whether human captives or buffalo and deer. Amongst the Jews no iron tool was used inbuilding the Temple at Jerusalem or in making an altar. The old wooden bridge (PonsSublicius) at Rome, which was considered sacred, was made and had to be kept in repairwithout the use of iron or bronze. It was expressly provided by law that the temple of JupiterLiber at Furfo might be repaired with iron tools. The council chamber at Cyzicus was con-structed of wood without any iron nails, the beams being so arranged that they could betaken out and replaced.This superstitious objection to iron perhaps dates from that early time in the history of societywhen iron was still a novelty, and as such was viewed by many with suspicion and dislike. Foreverything new is apt to excite the awe and dread of the savage. “It is a curious superstition,”Page 178"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"says a pioneer in Borneo, “this of the Dusuns, to attribute anything—whether good or bad,lucky or unlucky—that happens to them to something novel which has arrived in their country.For instance, my living in Kindram has caused the intensely hot weather we have experi-enced of late.” The unusually heavy rains which happened to follow the English survey of theNicobar Islands in the winter of 1886–1887 were imputed by the alarmed natives to the wrathof the spirits at the theodolites, dumpy-levellers, and other strange instruments which hadbeen set up in so many of their favourite haunts; and some of them proposed to soothe theanger of the spirits by sacrificing a pig. In the seventeenth century a succession of bad sea-sons excited a revolt among the Esthonian peasantry, who traced the origin of the evil to awatermill, which put a stream to some inconvenience by checking its flow. The first introduc-tion of iron ploughshares into Poland having been followed by a succession of bad harvests,the farmers attributed the badness of the crops to the iron ploughshares, and discarded themfor the old wooden ones. To this day the primitive Baduwis of Java, who live chiefly by hus-bandry, will use no iron tools in tilling their fields.The general dislike of innovation, which always makes itself strongly felt in the sphere of reli-gion, is sufficient by itself to account for the superstitious aversion to iron entertained by kingsand priests and attributed by them to the gods; possibly this aversion may have been intensi-fied in places by some such accidental cause as the series of bad seasons which cast dis-credit on iron ploughshares in Poland. But the disfavour in which iron is held by the gods andtheir ministers has another side. Their antipathy to the metal furnishes men with a weaponwhich may be turned against the spirits when occasion serves. As their dislike of iron is sup-posed to be so great that they will not approach persons and things protected by the obnox-ious metal, iron may obviously be employed as a charm for banning ghosts and other danger-ous spirits. And often it is so used. Thus in the Highlands of Scotland the great safeguardagainst the elfin race is iron, or, better yet, steel. The metal in any form, whether as a sword,a knife, a gun-barrel, or what not, is all-powerful for this purpose. Whenever you enter a fairydwelling you should always remember to stick a piece of steel, such as a knife, a needle, or afish-hook, in the door; for then the elves will not be able to shut the door till you come outagain. So, too, when you have shot a deer and are bringing it home at night, be sure to thrusta knife into the carcase, for that keeps the fairies from laying their weight on it. A knife or nailin your pocket is quite enough to prevent the fairies from lifting you up at night. Nails in thefront of a bed ward off elves from women “in the straw” and from their babes; but to makequite sure it is better to put the smoothing-iron under the bed, and the reaping-hook in thewindow. If a bull has fallen over a rock and been killed, a nail stuck into it will preserve theflesh from the fairies. Music discoursed on a Jew’s harp keeps the elfin women away from thehunter, because the tongue of the instrument is of steel. In Morocco iron is considered a greatprotection against demons; hence it is usual to place a knife or dagger under a sick man’s pil-low. The Singhalese believe that they are constantly surrounded by evil spirits, who lie in waitto do them harm. A peasant would not dare to carry good food, such as cakes or roast meat,from one place to another without putting an iron nail on it to prevent a demon from takingpossession of the viands and so making the eater ill. No sick person, whether man or woman,would venture out of the house without a bunch of keys or a knife in his hand, for withoutsuch a talisman he would fear that some devil might take advantage of his weak state to slipinto his body. And if a man has a large sore on his body he tries to keep a morsel of iron on itas a protection against demons. On the Slave Coast when a mother sees her child graduallywasting away, she concludes that a demon has entered into the child, and takes her meas-ures accordingly. To lure the demon out of the body of her offspring, she offers a sacrifice offood; and while the devil is bolting it, she attaches iron rings and small bells to her child’sankles and hangs iron chains round his neck. The jingling of the iron and the tinkling of thePage 179"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"bells are supposed to prevent the demon, when he has concluded his repast, from enteringagain into the body of the little sufferer. Hence many children may be seen in this part ofAfrica weighed down with iron ornaments.3. SHARP WEAPONS TABOOEDThere is a priestly king to the north of Zengwih in Burma, revered by the Sotih as the highestspiritual and temporal authority, into whose house no weapon or cutting instrument may bebrought. This rule may perhaps be explained by a custom observed by various peoples aftera death; they refrain from the use of sharp instruments so long as the ghost of the deceasedis supposed to be near, lest they should wound it. Thus among the Esquimaux of BeringStrait “during the day on which a person dies in the village no one is permitted to work, andthe relatives must perform no labour during the three following days. It is especially forbiddenduring this period to cut with any edged instrument, such as a knife or an axe; and the use ofpointed instruments, like needles or bodkins, is also forbidden. This is said to be done toavoid cutting or injuring the shade, which may be present at any time during this period, and,if accidentally injured by any of these things, it would become very angry and bring sicknessor death to the people. The relatives must also be very careful at this time not to make anyloud or harsh noises that may startle or anger the shade.” We have seen that in like mannerafter killing a white whale these Esquimaux abstain from the use of cutting or pointed instru-ments for four days, lest they should unwittingly cut or stab the whale’s ghost. The sametaboo is sometimes observed by them when there is a sick person in the village, probablyfrom a fear of injuring his shade which may be hovering outside of his body. After a death theRoumanians of Transylvania are careful not to leave a knife lying with the sharp edge upper-most so long as the corpse remains in the house, “or else the soul will be forced to ride onthe blade.” For seven days after a death, the corpse being still in the house, the Chineseabstain from the use of knives and needles, and even of chopsticks, eating their food withtheir fingers. On the third, sixth, ninth, and fortieth days after the funeral the old Prussiansand Lithuanians used to prepare a meal, to which, standing at the door, they invited the soulof the deceased. At these meals they sat silent round the table and used no knives and thewomen who served up the food were also without knives. If any morsels fell from the tablethey were left lying there for the lonely souls that had no living relations or friends to feedthem. When the meal was over the priest took a broom and swept the souls out of the house,saying, “Dear souls, ye have eaten and drunk. Go forth, go forth.” We can now understandwhy no cutting instrument may be taken into the house of the Burmese pontiff. Like so manypriestly kings, he is probably regarded as divine, and it is therefore right that his sacred spiritshould not be exposed to the risk of being cut or wounded whenever it quits his body to hoverinvisible in the air or to fly on some distant mission.4. BLOOD TABOOEDWe have seen that the Flamen Dialis was forbidden to touch or even name raw flesh. At cer-tain times a Brahman teacher is enjoined not to look on raw flesh, blood, or persons whosehands have been cut off. In Uganda the father of twins is in a state of taboo for some timeafter birth; among other rules he is forbidden to kill anything or to see blood. In the PelewIslands when a raid has been made on a village and a head carried off, the relations of theslain man are tabooed and have to submit to certain observances in order to escape thewrath of his ghost. They are shut up in the house, touch no raw flesh, and chew betel overwhich an incantation has been uttered by the exorcist. After this the ghost of the slaughteredman goes away to the enemy’s country in pursuit of his murderer. The taboo is probablyPage 180"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"based on the common belief that the soul or spirit of the animal is in the blood. As tabooedpersons are believed to be in a perilous state—for example, the relations of the slain man areliable to the attacks of his indignant ghost—it is especially necessary to isolate them fromcontact with spirits; hence the prohibition to touch raw meat. But as usual the taboo is onlythe special enforcement of a general precept; in other words, its observance is particularlyenjoined in circumstances which seem urgently to call for its application, but apart from suchcircumstances the prohibition is also observed, though less strictly, as a common rule of life.Thus some of the Esthonians will not taste blood because they believe that it contains theanimal’s soul, which would enter the body of the person who tasted the blood. Some Indiantribes of North America, “through a strong principle of religion, abstain in the strictest mannerfrom eating the blood of any animal, as it contains the life and spirit of the beast.” Jewishhunters poured out the blood of the game they had killed and covered it up with dust. Theywould not taste the blood, believing that the soul or life of the animal was in the blood, oractually was the blood.It is a common rule that royal blood may not be shed upon the ground. Hence when a king orone of his family is to be put to death a mode of execution is devised by which the royalblood shall not be spilt upon the earth. About the year 1688 the generalissimo of the armyrebelled against the king of Siam and put him to death “after the manner of royal criminals, oras princes of the blood are treated when convicted of capital crimes, which is by putting theminto a large iron caldron, and pounding them to pieces with wooden pestles, because none oftheir royal blood must be spilt on the ground, it being, by their religion, thought great impietyto contaminate the divine blood by mixing it with earth.” When Kublai Khan defeated and tookhis uncle Nayan, who had rebelled against him, he caused Nayan to be put to death by beingwrapt in a carpet and tossed to and fro till he died, “because he would not have the blood ofhis Line Imperial spilt upon the ground or exposed in the eye of Heaven and before the Sun.”“Friar Ricold mentions the Tartar maxim: ‘One Khan will put another to death to get posses-sion of the throne, but he takes great care that the blood be not spilt. For they say that it ishighly improper that the blood of the Great Khan should be spilt upon the ground; so theycause the victim to be smothered somehow or other.’ The like feeling prevails at the court ofBurma, where a peculiar mode of execution without bloodshed is reserved for princes of theblood.”The reluctance to spill royal blood seems to be only a particular case of a general unwilling-ness to shed blood or at least to allow it to fall on the ground. Marco Polo tells us that in hisday persons caught in the streets of Cambaluc (Peking) at unseasonable hours were arrest-ed, and if found guilty of a misdemeanor were beaten with a stick. “Under this punishmentpeople sometimes die, but they adopt it in order to eschew bloodshed, for their Bacsis saythat it is an evil thing to shed man’s blood.” In West Sussex people believe that the ground onwhich human blood has been shed is accursed and will remain barren for ever. Among someprimitive peoples, when the blood of a tribesman has to be spilt it is not suffered to fall uponthe ground, but is received upon the bodies of his fellow-tribesmen. Thus in some Australiantribes boys who are being circumcised are laid on a platform, formed by the living bodies ofthe tribesmen; and when a boy’s tooth is knocked out as an initiatory ceremony, he is seatedon the shoulders of a man, on whose breast the blood flows and may not be wiped away.“Also the Gauls used to drink their enemies’ blood and paint themselves therewith. So alsothey write that the old Irish were wont; and so have I seen some of the Irish do, but not theirenemies’ but friends’ blood, as, namely, at the execution of a notable traitor at Limerick, calledMurrogh O’Brien, I saw an old woman, which was his foster-mother, take up his head whilsthe was quartered and suck up all the blood that ran thereout, saying that the earth was notPage 181"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"worthy to drink it, and therewith also steeped her face and breast and tore her hair, crying outand shrieking most terribly.” Among the Latuka of Central Africa the earth on which a drop ofblood has fallen at childbirth is carefully scraped up with an iron shovel, put into a pot alongwith the water used in washing the mother, and buried tolerably deep outside the house onthe left-hand side. In West Africa, if a drop of your blood has fallen on the ground, you mustcarefully cover it up, rub and stamp it into the soil; if it has fallen on the side of a canoe or atree, the place is cut out and the chip destroyed. One motive of these African customs maybe a wish to prevent the blood from falling into the hands of magicians, who might make anevil use of it. That is admittedly the reason why people in West Africa stamp out any blood oftheirs which has dropped on the ground or cut out any wood that has been soaked with it.From a like dread of sorcery natives of New Guinea are careful to burn any sticks, leaves, orrags which are stained with their blood; and if the blood has dripped on the ground they turnup the soil and if possible light a fire on the spot. The same fear explains the curious dutiesdischarged by a class of men called ramanga or “blue blood” among the Betsileo ofMadagascar. It is their business to eat all the nail-parings and to lick up all the spilt blood ofthe nobles. When the nobles pare their nails, the parings are collected to the last scrap andswallowed by these ramanga. If the parings are too large, they are minced small and sogulped down. Again, should a nobleman wound himself, say in cutting his nails or treading onsomething, the ramanga lick up the blood as fast as possible. Nobles of high rank hardly goanywhere without these humble attendants; but if it should happen that there are none ofthem present, the cut nails and the spilt blood are carefully collected to be afterwards swal-lowed by the ramanga. There is scarcely a nobleman of any pretensions who does not strictlyobserve this custom, the intention of which probably is to prevent these parts of his personfrom falling into the hands of sorcerers, who on the principles of contagious magic could workhim harm thereby.The general explanation of the reluctance to shed blood on the ground is probably to befound in the belief that the soul is in the blood, and that therefore any ground on which it mayfall necessarily becomes taboo or sacred. In New Zealand anything upon which even a dropof a high chief’s blood chances to fall becomes taboo or sacred to him. For instance, a partyof natives having come to visit a chief in a fine new canoe, the chief got into it, but in doing soa splinter entered his foot, and the blood trickled on the canoe, which at once became sacredto him. The owner jumped out, dragged the canoe ashore opposite the chief’s house, and leftit there. Again, a chief in entering a missionary’s house knocked his head against a beam,and the blood flowed. The natives said that in former times the house would have belonged tothe chief. As usually happens with taboos of universal application, the prohibition to spill theblood of a tribesman on the ground applies with peculiar stringency to chiefs and kings, andis observed in their case long after it has ceased to be observed in the case of others.5. THE HEAD TABOOEDMany peoples regard the head as peculiarly sacred; the special sanctity attributed to it issometimes explained by a belief that it contains a spirit which is very sensitive to injury or dis-respect. Thus the Yorubas hold that every man has three spiritual inmates, of whom the first,called Olori, dwells in the head and is the man’s protector, guardian, and guide. Offerings aremade to this spirit, chiefly of fowls, and some of the blood mixed with palmoil is rubbed on theforehead. The Karens suppose that a being called the tso resides in the upper part of thehead, and while it retains its seat no harm can befall the person from the efforts of the sevenKelahs, or personified passions. “But if the tso becomes heedless or weak certain evil to theperson is the result. Hence the head is carefully attended to, and all possible pains are takenPage 182"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"to provide such dress and attire as will be pleasing to the tso.” The Siamese think that a spiritcalled khuan or kwun dwells in the human head, of which it is the guardian spirit. The spiritmust be carefully protected from injury of every kind; hence the act of shaving or cutting thehair is accompanied with many ceremonies. The kwun is very sensitive on points of honour,and would feel mortally insulted if the head in which he resides were touched by the hand ofa stranger. The Cambodians esteem it a grave offence to touch a man’s head; some of themwill not enter a place where anything whatever is suspended over their heads; and the mean-est Cambodian would never consent to live under an inhabited room. Hence the houses arebuilt of one story only; and even the Government respects the prejudice by never placing aprisoner in the stocks under the floor of a house, though the houses are raised high abovethe ground. The same superstition exists amongst the Malays; for an early traveller reportsthat in Java people “wear nothing on their heads, and say that nothing must be on their heads... and if any person were to put his hand upon their head they would kill him; and they do notbuild houses with storeys, in order that they may not walk over each other’s heads.” The same superstition as to the head is found in full force throughout Polynesia. Thus ofGattanewa, a Marquesan chief, it is said that “to touch the top of his head, or anything whichhad been on his head, was sacrilege. To pass over his head was an indignity never to be for-gotten.” The son of a Marquesan high priest has been seen to roll on the ground in an agonyof rage and despair, begging for death, because some one had desecrated his head anddeprived him of his divinity by sprinkling a few drops of water on his hair. But it was not theMarquesan chiefs only whose heads were sacred. The head of every Marquesan was taboo,and might neither be touched nor stepped over by another; even a father might not step overthe head of his sleeping child; women were forbidden to carry or touch anything that hadbeen in contact with, or had merely hung over, the head of their husband or father. No onewas allowed to be over the head of the king of Tonga. In Tahiti any one who stood over theking or queen, or passed his hand over their heads, might be put to death. Until certain riteswere performed over it, a Tahitian infant was especially taboo; whatever touched the child’shead, while it was in this state, became sacred and was deposited in a consecrated placerailed in for the purpose at the child’s house. If a branch of a tree touched the child’s head,the tree was cut down; and if in its fall it injured another tree so as to penetrate the bark, thattree also was cut down as unclean and unfit for use. After the rites were performed thesespecial taboos ceased; but the head of a Tahitian was always sacred, he never carried any-thing on it, and to touch it was an offence. So sacred was the head of a Maori chief that “if heonly touched it with his fingers, he was obliged immediately to apply them to his nose, andsnuff up the sanctity which they had acquired by the touch, and thus restore it to the part fromwhence it was taken.” On account of the sacredness of his head a Maori chief “could not blowthe fire with his mouth, for the breath being sacred, communicated his sanctity to it, and abrand might be taken by a slave, or a man of another tribe, or the fire might be used for otherpurposes, such as cooking, and so cause his death.”6. HAIR TABOOEDWhen the head was considered so sacred that it might not even be touched without graveoffence, it is obvious that the cutting of the hair must have been a delicate and difficult opera-tion. The difficulties and dangers which, on the primitive view, beset the operation are of twokinds. There is first the danger of disturbing the spirit of the head, which may be injured in theprocess and may revenge itself upon the person who molests him. Secondly, there is the diffi-culty of disposing of the shorn locks. For the savage believes that the sympathetic connexionwhich exists between himself and every part of his body continues to exist even after thePage 183"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"physical connexion has been broken, and that therefore he will suffer from any harm that maybefall the several parts of his body, such as the clippings of his hair or the parings of his nails.Accordingly he takes care that these severed portions of himself shall not be left in placeswhere they might either be exposed to accidental injury or fall into the hands of malicious per-sons who might work magic on them to his detriment or death. Such dangers are common toall, but sacred persons have more to fear from them than ordinary people, so the precautionstaken by them are proportionately stringent. The simplest way of evading the peril is not to cutthe hair at all; and this is the expedient adopted where the risk is thought to be more thanusually great. The Frankish kings were never allowed to crop their hair; from their childhoodupwards they had to keep it unshorn. To poll the long locks that floated on their shoulderswould have been to renounce their right to the throne. When the wicked brothers Clotaire andChildebert coveted the kingdom of their dead brother Clodomir, they inveigled into their powertheir little nephews, the two sons of Clodomir; and having done so, they sent a messengerbearing scissors and a naked sword to the children’s grandmother, Queen Clotilde, at Paris.The envoy showed the scissors and the sword to Clotilde, and bade her choose whether thechildren should be shorn and live or remain unshorn and die. The proud queen replied that ifher grandchildren were not to come to the throne she would rather see them dead thanshorn. And murdered they were by their ruthless uncle Clotaire with his own hand. The king ofPonape, one of the Caroline Islands, must wear his hair long, and so must his grandees.Among the Hos, a negro tribe of West Africa, “there are priests on whose head no razor maycome during the whole of their lives. The god who dwells in the man forbids the cutting of hishair on pain of death. If the hair is at last too long, the owner must pray to his god to allowhim at least to clip the tips of it. The hair is in fact conceived as the seat and lodging-place ofhis god, so that were it shorn the god would lose his abode in the priest.” The members of aMasai clan, who are believed to possess the art of making rain, may not pluck out theirbeards, because the loss of their beards would, it is supposed, entail the loss of their rain-making powers. The head chief and the sorcerers of the Masai observe the same rule for alike reason: they think that were they to pull out their beards, their supernatural gifts woulddesert them.Again, men who have taken a vow of vengeance sometimes keep their hair unshorn till theyhave fulfilled their vow. Thus of the Marquesans we are told that “occasionally they have theirhead entirely shaved, except one lock on the crown, which is worn loose or put up in a knot.But the latter mode of wearing the hair is only adopted by them when they have a solemnvow, as to revenge the death of some near relation, etc. In such case the lock is never cut offuntil they have fulfilled their promise.” A similar custom was sometimes observed by theancient Germans; among the Chatti the young warriors never clipped their hair or their beardtill they had slain an enemy. Among the Toradjas, when a child’s hair is cut to rid it of vermin,some locks are allowed to remain on the crown of the head as a refuge for one of the child’ssouls. Otherwise the soul would have no place in which to settle, and the child would sicken.The Karo-Bataks are much afraid of frightening away the soul of a child; hence when they cutits hair, they always leave a patch unshorn, to which the soul can retreat before the shears.Usually this lock remains unshorn all through life, or at least up till manhood.7. CEREMONIES AT HAIR-CUTTINGBut when it becomes necessary to crop the hair, measures are taken to lessen the dangerswhich are supposed to attend the operation. The chief of Namosi in Fiji always ate a man byway of precaution when he had had his hair cut. “There was a certain clan that had to providethe victim, and they used to sit in solemn council among themselves to choose him. It was aPage 184"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"sacrificial feast to avert evil from the chief.” Amongst the Maoris many spells were uttered athair-cutting; one, for example, was spoken to consecrate the obsidian knife with which thehair was cut; another was pronounced to avert the thunder and lightning which hair-cuttingwas believed to cause. “He who has had his hair cut is in immediate charge of the Atua (spir-it); he is removed from the contact and society of his family and his tribe; he dare not touchhis food himself; it is put into his mouth by another person; nor can he for some days resumehis accustomed occupations or associate with his fellow-men.” The person who cuts the hairis also tabooed; his hands having been in contact with a sacred head, he may not touch foodwith them or engage in any other employment; he is fed by another person with food cookedover a sacred fire. He cannot be released from the taboo before the following day, when herubs his hands with potato or fern root which has been cooked on a sacred fire; and this foodhaving been taken to the head of the family in the female line and eaten by her, his hands arefreed from the taboo. In some parts of New Zealand the most sacred day of the year was thatappointed for hair-cutting; the people assembled in large numbers on that day from all theneighbourhood.8. DISPOSAL OF CUT HAIR AND NAILSBut even when the hair and nails have been safely cut, there remains the difficulty of dispos-ing of them, for their owner believes himself liable to suffer from any harm that may befallthem. The notion that a man may be bewitched by means of the clippings of his hair, the par-ings of his nails, or any other severed portion of his person is almost world-wide, and attestedby evidence too ample, too familiar, and too tedious in its uniformity to be here analysed atlength. The general idea on which the superstition rests is that of the sympathetic connexionsupposed to persist between a person and everything that has once been part of his body orin any way closely related to him. A very few examples must suffice. They belong to thatbranch of sympathetic magic which may be called contagious. Dread of sorcery, we are told,formed one of the most salient characteristics of the Marquesan islanders in the old days.The sorcerer took some of the hair, spittle, or other bodily refuse of the man he wished toinjure, wrapped it up in a leaf, and placed the packet in a bag woven of threads or fibres,which were knotted in an intricate way. The whole was then buried with certain rites, andthereupon the victim wasted away of a languishing sickness which lasted twenty days. Hislife, however, might be saved by discovering and digging up the buried hair, spittle, or whatnot; for as soon as this was done the power of the charm ceased. A Maori sorcerer intent onbewitching somebody sought to get a tress of his victim’s hair, the parings of his nails, someof his spittle, or a shred of his garment. Having obtained the object, whatever it was, hechanted certain spells and curses over it in a falsetto voice and buried it in the ground. As thething decayed, the person to whom it had belonged was supposed to waste away. When anAustralian blackfellow wishes to get rid of his wife, he cuts off a lock of her hair in her sleep,ties it to his spear-thrower, and goes with it to a neighbouring tribe, where he gives it to afriend. His friend sticks the spear-thrower up every night before the camp fire, and when itfalls down it is a sign that the wife is dead. The way in which the charm operates wasexplained to Dr. Howitt by a Wirajuri man. “You see,” he said, “when a blackfellow doctor getshold of something belonging to a man and roasts it with things, and sings over it, the firecatches hold of the smell of the man, and that settles the poor fellow.”The Huzuls of the Carpathians imagine that if mice get a person’s shorn hair and make a nestof it, the person will suffer from headache or even become idiotic. Similarly in Germany it is acommon notion that if birds find a person’s cut hair, and build their nests with it, the personwill suffer from headache; sometimes it is thought that he will have an eruption on the head.Page 185"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The same superstition prevails, or used to prevail, in West Sussex.Again it is thought that cut or combed-out hair may disturb the weather by producing rain andhail, thunder and lightning. We have seen that in New Zealand a spell was uttered at hair-cut-ting to avert thunder and lightning. In the Tyrol, witches are supposed to use cut or combed-out hair to make hailstones or thunderstorms with. Thlinkeet Indians have been known toattribute stormy weather to the rash act of a girl who had combed her hair outside of thehouse. The Romans seem to have held similar views, for it was a maxim with them that noone on shipboard should cut his hair or nails except in a storm, that is, when the mischief wasalready done. In the Highlands of Scotland it is said that no sister should comb her hair atnight if she have a brother at sea. In West Africa, when the Mani of Chitombe or Jumba died,the people used to run in crowds to the corpse and tear out his hair, teeth, and nails, whichthey kept as a rain-charm, believing that otherwise no rain would fall. The Makoko of theAnzikos begged the missionaries to give him half their beards as a rain-charm.If cut hair and nails remain in sympathetic connexion with the person from whose body theyhave been severed, it is clear that they can be used as hostages for his good behaviour byany one who may chance to possess them; for on the principles of contagious magic he hasonly to injure the hair or nails in order to hurt simultaneously their original owner. Hence whenthe Nandi have taken a prisoner they shave his head and keep the shorn hair as a surety thathe will not attempt to escape; but when the captive is ransomed, they return his shorn hairwith him to his own people.To preserve the cut hair and nails from injury and from the dangerous uses to which they maybe put by sorcerers, it is necessary to deposit them in some safe place. The shorn locks of aMaori chief were gathered with much care and placed in an adjoining cemetery. The Tahitiansburied the cuttings of their hair at the temples. In the streets of Soku a modern travellerobserved cairns of large stones piled against walls with tufts of human hair inserted in thecrevices. On asking the meaning of this, he was told that when any native of the place polledhis hair he carefully gathered up the clippings and deposited them in one of these cairns, allof which were sacred to the fetish and therefore inviolable. These cairns of sacred stones, hefurther learned, were simply a precaution against witchcraft, for if a man were not thus carefulin disposing of his hair, some of it might fall into the hands of his enemies, who would, bymeans of it, be able to cast spells over him and so compass his destruction. When the top-knot of a Siamese child has been cut with great ceremony, the short hairs are put into a littlevessel made of plantain leaves and set adrift on the nearest river or canal. As they float away,all that was wrong or harmful in the child’s disposition is believed to depart with them. Thelong hairs are kept till the child makes a pilgrimage to the holy Footprint of Buddha on thesacred hill at Prabat. They are then presented to the priests, who are supposed to make theminto brushes with which they sweep the Footprint; but in fact so much hair is thus offeredevery year that the priests cannot use it all, so they quietly burn the superfluity as soon as thepilgrims’ backs are turned. The cut hair and nails of the Flamen Dialis were buried under alucky tree. The shorn tresses of the Vestal Virgins were hung on an ancient lotus-tree.Often the clipped hair and nails are stowed away in any secret place, not necessarily in atemple or cemetery or at a tree, as in the cases already mentioned. Thus in Swabia you arerecommended to deposit your clipped hair in some spot where neither sun nor moon canshine on it, for example in the earth or under a stone. In Danzig it is buried in a bag under thethreshold. In Ugi, one of the Solomon Islands, men bury their hair lest it should fall into thehands of an enemy, who would make magic with it and so bring sickness or calamity onPage 186"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"them. The same fear seems to be general in Melanesia, and has led to a regular practice ofhiding cut hair and nails. The same practice prevails among many tribes of South Africa, froma fear lest wizards should get hold of the severed particles and work evil with them. TheCaffres carry still further this dread of allowing any portion of themselves to fall into the handsof an enemy; for not only do they bury their cut hair and nails in a secret spot, but when oneof them cleans the head of another he preserves the vermin which he catches, “carefullydelivering them to the person to whom they originally appertained, supposing, according totheir theory, that as they derived their support from the blood of the man from whom theywere taken, should they be killed by another, the blood of his neighbour would be in his pos-session, thus placing in his hands the power of some superhuman influence.”Sometimes the severed hair and nails are preserved, not to prevent them from falling into thehands of a magician, but that the owner may have them at the resurrection of the body, towhich some races look forward. Thus the Incas of Peru “took extreme care to preserve thenail-parings and the hairs that were shorn off or torn out with a comb; placing them in holes orniches in the walls; and if they fell out, any other Indian that saw them picked them up andput them in their places again. I very often asked different Indians, at various times, why theydid this, in order to see what they would say, and they all replied in the same words saying,‘Know that all persons who are born must return to life’ (they have no word to express resur-rection), ‘and the souls must rise out of their tombs with all that belonged to their bodies. We,therefore, in order that we may not have to search for our hair and nails at a time when therewill be much hurry and confusion, place them in one place, that they may be brought togethermore conveniently, and, whenever it is possible, we are also careful to spit in one place.’”Similarly the Turks never throw away the parings of their nails, but carefully stow them incracks of the walls or of the boards, in the belief that they will be needed at the resurrection.The Armenians do not throw away their cut hair and nails and extracted teeth, but hide themin places that are esteemed holy, such as a crack in the church wall, a pillar of the house, ora hollow tree. They think that all these severed portions of themselves will be wanted at theresurrection, and that he who has not stowed them away in a safe place will have to huntabout for them on the great day. In the village of Drumconrath in Ireland there used to besome old women who, having ascertained from Scripture that the hairs of their heads were allnumbered by the Almighty, expected to have to account for them at the day of judgment. Inorder to be able to do so they stuffed the severed hair away in the thatch of their cottages.Some people burn their loose hair to save it from falling into the hands of sorcerers. This isdone by the Patagonians and some of the Victorian tribes. In the Upper Vosges they say thatyou should never leave the clippings of your hair and nails lying about, but burn them to hin-der the sorcerers from using them against you. For the same reason Italian women eitherburn their loose hairs or throw them into a place where no one is likely to look for them. Thealmost universal dread of witchcraft induces the West African negroes, the Makololo of SouthAfrica, and the Tahitians to burn or bury their shorn hair. In the Tyrol many people burn theirhair lest the witches should use it to raise thunderstorms; others burn or bury it to prevent thebirds from lining their nests with it, which would cause the heads from which the hair came toache.This destruction of the hair and nails plainly involves an inconsistency of thought. The objectof the destruction is avowedly to prevent these severed portions of the body from being usedby sorcerers. But the possibility of their being so used depends upon the supposed sympa-thetic connexion between them and the man from whom they were severed. And if this sym-pathetic connexion still exists, clearly these severed portions cannot be destroyed withoutPage 187"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"injury to the man.9. SPITTLE TABOOEDThe same fear of witchcraft which has led so many people to hide or destroy their loose hairand nails has induced other or the same people to treat their spittle in a like fashion. For onthe principles of sympathetic magic the spittle is part of the man, and whatever is done to itwill have a corresponding effect on him. A Chilote Indian, who has gathered up the spittle ofan enemy, will put it in a potato, and hang the potato in the smoke, uttering certain spells ashe does so in the belief that his foe will waste away as the potato dries in the smoke. Or hewill put the spittle in a frog and throw the animal into an inaccessible, unnavigable river, whichwill make the victim quake and shake with ague. The natives of Urewera, a district of NewZealand, enjoyed a high reputation for their skill in magic. It was said that they made use ofpeople’s spittle to bewitch them. Hence visitors were careful to conceal their spittle, lest theyshould furnish these wizards with a handle for working them harm. Similarly among sometribes of South Africa no man will spit when an enemy is near, lest his foe should find the spit-tle and give it to a wizard, who would then mix it with magical ingredients so as to injure theperson from whom it fell. Even in a man’s own house his saliva is carefully swept away andobliterated for a similar reason.If common folk are thus cautious, it is natural that kings and chiefs should be doubly so. Inthe Sandwich Islands chiefs were attended by a confidential servant bearing a portable spit-toon, and the deposit was carefully buried every morning to put it out of the reach of sorcer-ers. On the Slave Coast, for the same reason, whenever a king or chief expectorates, thesaliva is scrupulously gathered up and hidden or buried. The same precautions are taken forthe same reason with the spittle of the chief of Tabali in Southern Nigeria.The magical use to which spittle may be put marks it out, like blood or nail-parings, as a suit-able material basis for a covenant, since by exchanging their saliva the covenanting partiesgive each other a guarantee of good faith. If either of them afterwards foreswears himself, theother can punish his perfidy by a magical treatment of the purjurer’s spittle which he has inhis custody. Thus when the Wajagga of East Africa desire to make a covenant, the two par-ties will sometimes sit down with a bowl of milk or beer between them, and after uttering anincantation over the beverage they each take a mouthful of the milk or beer and spit it into theother’s mouth. In urgent cases, when there is no time to spend on ceremony, the two will sim-ply spit into each other’s mouth, which seals the covenant just as well.10. FOODS TABOOEDAs might have been expected, the superstitions of the savage cluster thick about the subjectof food; and he abstains from eating many animals and plants, wholesome enough in them-selves, which for one reason or another he fancies would prove dangerous or fatal to theeater. Examples of such abstinence are too familiar and far too numerous to quote. But if theordinary man is thus deterred by superstitious fear from partaking of various foods, therestraints of this kind which are laid upon sacred or tabooed persons, such as kings andpriests, are still more numerous and stringent. We have already seen that the Flamen Dialiswas forbidden to eat or even name several plants and animals, and that the flesh diet ofEgyptian kings was restricted to veal and goose. In antiquity many priests and many kings ofbarbarous peoples abstained wholly from a flesh diet. The Gangas or fetish priests of theLoango Coast are forbidden to eat or even see a variety of animals and fish, in consequencePage 188"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"of which their flesh diet is extremely limited; often they live only on herbs and roots, thoughthey may drink fresh blood. The heir to the throne of Loango is forbidden from infancy to eatpork; from early childhood he is interdicted the use of the cola fruit in company; at puberty heis taught by a priest not to partake of fowls except such as he has himself killed and cooked;and so the number of taboos goes on increasing with his years. In Fernando Po the king afterinstallation is forbidden to eat cocco (arum acaule), deer, and porcupine, which are the ordi-nary foods of the people. The head chief of the Masai may eat nothing but milk, honey, andthe roasted livers of goats; for if he partook of any other food he would lose his power ofsoothsaying and of compounding charms.11. KNOTS AND STRINGS TABOOEDWe have seen that among the many taboos which the Flamen Dialis at Rome had to observe,there was one that forbade him to have a knot on any part of his garments, and another thatobliged him to wear no ring unless it were broken. In like manner Moslem pilgrims to Meccaare in a state of sanctity or taboo and may wear on their persons neither knots nor rings.These rules are probably of kindred significance, and may conveniently be considered togeth-er. To begin with knots, many people in different parts of the world entertain a strong objectionto having any knot about their person at certain critical seasons, particularly childbirth, mar-riage, and death. Thus among the Saxons of Transylvania, when a woman is in travail allknots on her garments are untied, because it is believed that this will facilitate her delivery,and with the same intention all the locks in the house, whether on doors or boxes, areunlocked. The Lapps think that a lying-in woman should have no knot on her garments,because a knot would have the effect of making the delivery difficult and painful. In the EastIndies this superstition is extended to the whole time of pregnancy; the people believe that ifa pregnant woman were to tie knots, or braid, or make anything fast, the child would therebybe constricted or the woman would herself be “tied up” when her time came. Nay, some ofthem enforce the observance of the rule on the father as well as the mother of the unbornchild. Among the Sea Dyaks neither of the parents may bind up anything with a string ormake anything fast during the wife’s pregnancy. In the Toumbuluh tribe of North Celebes aceremony is performed in the fourth or fifth month of a woman’s pregnancy, and after it herhusband is forbidden, among many other things, to tie any fast knots and to sit with his legscrossed over each other.In all these cases the idea seems to be that the tying of a knot would, as they say in the EastIndies, “tie up” the woman, in other words, impede and perhaps prevent her delivery, or delayher convalescence after the birth. On the principles of homoeopathic or imitative magic thephysical obstacle or impediment of a knot on a cord would create a corresponding obstacle orimpediment in the body of the woman. That this is really the explanation of the rule appearsfrom a custom observed by the Hos of West Africa at a difficult birth. When a woman is inhard labour and cannot bring forth, they call in a magician to her aid. He looks at her andsays, “The child is bound in the womb, that is why she cannot be delivered.” On theentreaties of her female relations he then promises to loosen the bond so that she may bringforth. For that purpose he orders them to fetch a tough creeper from the forest, and with it hebinds the hands and feet of the sufferer on her back. Then he takes a knife and calls out thewoman’s name, and when she answers he cuts through the creeper with a knife, saying, “Icut through to-day thy bonds and thy child’s bonds.” After that he chops up the creeper small,puts the bits in a vessel of water, and bathes the woman with the water. Here the cutting ofthe creeper with which the woman’s hands and feet are bound is a simple piece of homoeo-pathic or imitative magic: by releasing her limbs from their bonds the magician imagines thatPage 189"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"he simultaneously releases the child in her womb from the trammels which impede its birth.The same train of thought underlies a practice observed by some peoples of opening alllocks, doors, and so on, while a birth is taking place in the house. We have seen that at sucha time the Germans of Transylvania open all the locks, and the same thing is done also inVoigtland and Mecklenburg. In North-western Argyllshire superstitious people used to openevery lock in the house at childbirth. In the island of Salsette near Bombay, when a woman isin hard labour, all locks of doors or drawers are opened with a key to facilitate her delivery.Among the Mandelings of Sumatra the lids of all chests, boxes, pans, and so forth areopened; and if this does not produce the desired effect, the anxious husband has to strike theprojecting ends of some of the house-beams in order to loosen them; for they think that“everything must be open and loose to facilitate the delivery.” In Chittagong, when a womancannot bring her child to the birth, the midwife gives orders to throw all doors and windowswide open, to uncork all bottles, to remove the bungs from all casks, to unloose the cows inthe stall, the horses in the stable, the watchdog in his kennel, to set free sheep, fowls, ducks,and so forth. This universal liberty accorded to the animals and even to inanimate things is,according to the people, an infallible means of ensuring the woman’s delivery and allowingthe babe to be born. In the island of Saghalien, when a woman is in labour, her husbandundoes everything that can be undone. He loosens the plaits of his hair and the laces of hisshoes. Then he unties whatever is tied in the house or its vicinity. In the courtyard he takesthe axe out of the log in which it is stuck; he unfastens the boat, if it is moored to a tree, hewithdraws the cartridges from his gun, and the arrows from his crossbow.Again, we have seen that a Toumbuluh man abstains not only from tying knots, but also fromsitting with crossed legs during his wife’s pregnancy. The train of thought is the same in bothcases. Whether you cross threads in tying a knot, or only cross your legs in sitting at yourease, you are equally, on the principles of homoeopathic magic, crossing or thwarting the freecourse of things, and your action cannot but check and impede whatever may be going for-ward in your neighbourhood. Of this important truth the Romans were fully aware. To sitbeside a pregnant woman or a patient under medical treatment with clasped hands, says thegrave Pliny, is to cast a malignant spell over the person, and it is worse still if you nurse yourleg or legs with your clasped hands, or lay one leg over the other. Such postures wereregarded by the old Romans as a let and hindrance to business of every sort, and at a coun-cil of war or a meeting of magistrates, at prayers and sacrifices, no man was suffered to crosshis legs or clasp his hands. The stock instance of the dreadful consequences that might flowfrom doing one or the other was that of Alcmena, who travailed with Hercules for seven daysand seven nights, because the goddess Lucina sat in front of the house with clasped handsand crossed legs, and the child could not be born until the goddess had been beguiled intochanging her attitude. It is a Bulgarian superstition that if a pregnant woman is in the habit ofsitting with crossed legs, she will suffer much in childbed. In some parts of Bavaria, whenconversation comes to a standstill and silence ensues, they say, “Surely somebody hascrossed his legs.”The magical effect of knots in trammelling and obstructing human activity was believed to bemanifested at marriage not less than at birth. During the Middle Ages, and down to the eigh-teenth century, it seems to have been commonly held in Europe that the consummation ofmarriage could be prevented by any one who, while the wedding ceremony was taking place,either locked a lock or tied a knot in a cord, and then threw the lock or the cord away. Thelock or the knotted cord had to be flung into water; and until it had been found and unlocked,or untied, no real union of the married pair was possible. Hence it was a grave offence, notonly to cast such a spell, but also to steal or make away with the material instrument of it,Page 190"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"whether lock or knotted cord. In the year 1718 the parliament of Bordeaux sentenced someone to be burned alive for having spread desolation through a whole family by means of knot-ted cords; and in 1705 two persons were condemned to death in Scotland for stealing certaincharmed knots which a woman had made, in order thereby to mar the wedded happiness ofSpalding of Ashintilly. The belief in the efficacy of these charms appears to have lingered inthe Highlands of Pertshire down to the end of the eighteenth century, for at that time it wasstill customary in the beautiful parish of Logierait, between the river Tummel and the river Tay,to unloose carefully every knot in the clothes of the bride and bridegroom before the celebra-tion of the marriage ceremony. We meet with the same superstition and the same custom atthe present day in Syria. The persons who help a Syrian bridegroom to don his wedding gar-ments take care that no knot is tied on them and no button buttoned, for they believe that abutton buttoned or a knot tied would put it within the power of his enemies to deprive him ofhis nuptial rights by magical means. The fear of such charms is diffused all over North Africaat the present day. To render a bridegroom impotent the enchanter has only to tie a knot in ahandkerchief which he had previously placed quietly on some part of the bridegroom’s bodywhen he was mounted on horseback ready to fetch his bride: so long as the knot in the hand-kerchief remains tied, so long will the bridegroom remain powerless to consummate the mar-riage.The maleficent power of knots may also be manifested in the infliction of sickness, disease,and all kinds of misfortune. Thus among the Hos of West Africa a sorcerer will sometimescurse his enemy and tie a knot in a stalk of grass, saying, “I have tied up So-and-so in thisknot. May all evil light upon him! When he goes into the field, may a snake sting him! Whenhe goes to the chase, may a ravening beast attack him! And when he steps into a river, maythe water sweep him away! When it rains, may the lightning strike him! May evil nights behis!” It is believed that in the knot the sorcerer has bound up the life of his enemy. In theKoran there is an allusion to the mischief of “those who puff into the knots,” and an Arab com-mentator on the passage explains that the words refer to women who practise magic by tyingknots in cords, and then blowing and spitting upon them. He goes on to relate how, onceupon a time, a wicked Jew bewitched the prophet Mohammed himself by tying nine knots ona string, which he then hid in a well. So the prophet fell ill, and nobody knows what mighthave happened if the archangel Gabriel had not opportunely revealed to the holy man theplace where the knotted cord was concealed. The trusty Ali soon fetched the baleful thingfrom the well; and the prophet recited over it certain charms, which were specially revealed tohim for the purpose. At every verse of the charms a knot untied itself, and the prophet experi-enced a certain relief.If knots are supposed to kill, they are also supposed to cure. This follows from the belief thatto undo the knots which are causing sickness will bring the sufferer relief. But apart from thisnegative virtue of maleficent knots, there are certain beneficent knots to which a positivepower of healing is ascribed. Pliny tells us that some folk cured diseases of the groin by tak-ing a thread from a web, tying seven or nine knots on it, and then fastening it to the patient’sgroin; but to make the cure effectual it was necessary to name some widow as each knot wastied. O’Donovan describes a remedy for fever employed among the Turcomans. Theenchanter takes some camel hair and spins it into a stout thread, droning a spell the while.Next he ties seven knots on the thread, blowing on each knot before he pulls it tight. Thisknotted thread is then worn as a bracelet on his wrist by the patient. Every day one of theknots is untied and blown upon, and when the seventh knot is undone the whole thread isrolled up into a ball and thrown into a river, bearing away (as they imagine) the fever with it.Page 191"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Again knots may be used by an enchantress to win a lover and attach him firmly to herself.Thus the love-sick maid in Virgil seeks to draw Daphnis to her from the city by spells and bytying three knots on each of three strings of different colours. So an Arab maiden, who hadlost her heart to a certain man, tried to gain his love and bind him to herself by tying knots inhis whip; but her jealous rival undid the knots. On the same principle magic knots may beemployed to stop a runaway. In Swazieland you may often see grass tied in knots at the sideof the footpaths. Every one of these knots tells of a domestic tragedy. A wife has run awayfrom her husband, and he and his friends have gone in pursuit, binding up the paths, as theycall it, in this fashion to prevent the fugitive from doubling back over them. A net, from its afflu-ence of knots, has always been considered in Russia very efficacious against sorcerers;hence in some places, when a bride is being dressed in her wedding attire, a fishing-net isflung over her to keep her out of harm’s way. For a similar purpose the bridegroom and hiscompanions are often girt with pieces of net, or at least with tight-drawn girdles, for before awizard can begin to injure them he must undo all the knots in the net, or take off the girdles.But often a Russian amulet is merely a knotted thread. A skein of red wool wound about thearms and legs is thought to ward off agues and fevers; and nine skeins, fastened round achild’s neck, are deemed a preservative against scarlatina. In the Tver Government a bag ofa special kind is tied to the neck of the cow which walks before the rest of a herd, in order tokeep off wolves; its force binds the maw of the ravening beast. On the same principle, a pad-lock is carried thrice round a herd of horses before they go afield in the spring, and the bearerlocks and unlocks it as he goes, saying, “I lock from my herd the mouths of the grey wolveswith this steel lock.”Knots and locks may serve to avert not only wizards and wolves but death itself. When theybrought a woman to the stake at St. Andrews in 1572 to burn her alive for a witch, they foundon her a white cloth like a collar, with strings and many knots on the strings. They took it fromher, sorely against her will, for she seemed to think that she could not die in the fire, if onlythe cloth with the knotted strings was on her. When it was taken away, she said, “Now I haveno hope of myself.” In many parts of England it is thought that a person cannot die so long asany locks are locked or bolts shot in the house. It is therefore a very common practice toundo all locks and bolts when the sufferer is plainly near his end, in order that his agony maynot be unduly prolonged. For example, in the year 1863, at Taunton, a child lay sick of scar-latina and death seemed inevitable. “A jury of matrons was, as it were, empanelled, and toprevent the child ‘dying hard’ all the doors in the house, all the drawers, all the boxes, all thecupboards were thrown wide open, the keys taken out, and the body of the child placedunder a beam, whereby a sure, certain, and easy passage into eternity could be secured.”Strange to say, the child declined to avail itself of the facilities for dying so obligingly placed atits disposal by the sagacity and experience of the British matrons of Taunton; it preferred tolive rather than give up the ghost just then.The rule which prescribes that at certain magical and religious ceremonies the hair shouldhang loose and the feet should be bare is probably based on the same fear of trammellingand impeding the action in hand, whatever it may be, by the presence of any knot or constric-tion, whether on the head or on the feet of the performer. A similar power to bind and hamperspiritual as well as bodily activities is ascribed by some people to rings. Thus in the island ofCarpathus people never button the clothes they put upon a dead body and they are careful toremove all rings from it; “for the spirit, they say, can even be detained in the little finger, andcannot rest.” Here it is plain that even if the soul is not definitely supposed to issue at deathfrom the finger-tips, yet the ring is conceived to exercise a certain constrictive influence whichdetains and imprisons the immortal spirit in spite of its efforts to escape from the tabernacle ofPage 192"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"clay; in short the ring, like the knot, acts as a spiritual fetter. This may have been the reasonof an ancient Greek maxim, attributed to Pythagoras, which forbade people to wear rings.Nobody might enter the ancient Arcadian sanctuary of the Mistress at Lycosura with a ring onhis or her finger. Persons who consulted the oracle of Faunus had to be chaste, to eat noflesh, and to wear no rings.On the other hand, the same constriction which hinders the egress of the soul may preventthe entrance of evil spirits; hence we find rings used as amulets against demons, witches,and ghosts. In the Tyrol it is said that a woman in childbed should never take off her wedding-ring, or spirits and witches will have power over her. Among the Lapps, the person who isabout to place a corpse in the coffin receives from the husband, wife, or children of thedeceased a brass ring, which he must wear fastened to his right arm until the corpse is safelydeposited in the grave. The ring is believed to serve the person as an amulet against anyharm which the ghost might do to him. How far the custom of wearing finger-rings may havebeen influenced by, or even have sprung from, a belief in their efficacy as amulets to keep thesoul in the body, or demons out of it, is a question which seems worth considering. Here weare only concerned with the belief in so far as it seems to throw light on the rule that theFlamen Dialis might not wear a ring unless it were broken. Taken in conjunction with the rulewhich forbade him to have a knot on his garments, it points to a fear that the powerful spiritembodied in him might be trammelled and hampered in its goings-out and comings-in bysuch corporeal and spiritual fetters as rings and knots.Chapter XXIITabooed Words1. PERSONAL NAMES TABOOEDUNABLE to discriminate clearly between words and things, the savage commonly fancies thatthe link between a name and the person or thing denominated by it is not a mere arbitraryand ideal association, but a real and substantial bond which unites the two in such a way thatmagic may be wrought on a man just as easily through his name as through his hair, hisnails, or any other material part of his person. In fact, primitive man regards his name as avital portion of himself and takes care of it accordingly. Thus, for example, the North AmericanIndian “regards his name, not as a mere label, but as a distinct part of his personality, just asmuch as are his eyes or his teeth, and believes that injury will result as surely from the mali-cious handling of his name as from a wound inflicted on any part of his physical organism.This belief was found among the various tribes from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and has occa-sioned a number of curious regulations in regard to the concealment and change of names.”Some Esquimaux take new names when they are old, hoping thereby to get a new lease oflife. The Tolampoos of Celebes believe that if you write a man’s name down you can carry offhis soul along with it. Many savages at the present day regard their names as vital parts ofthemselves, and therefore take great pains to conceal their real names, lest these should giveto evil-disposed persons a handle by which to injure their owners.Thus, to begin with the savages who rank at the bottom of the social scale, we are told thatthe secrecy with which among the Australian aborigines personal names are often kept fromgeneral knowledge “arises in great measure from the belief that an enemy, who knows yourname, has in it something which he can use magically to your detriment.” “An Australianblack,” says another writer, “is always very unwilling to tell his real name, and there is nodoubt that this reluctance is due to the fear that through his name he may be injured by sor-Page 193"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"cerers.” Amongst the tribes of Central Australia every man, woman, and child has, besides apersonal name which is in common use, a secret or sacred name which is bestowed by theolder men upon him or her soon after birth, and which is known to none but the fully initiatedmembers of the group. This secret name is never mentioned except upon the most solemnoccasions; to utter it in the hearing of women or of men of another group would be a mostserious breach of tribal custom, as serious as the most flagrant case of sacrilege among our-selves. When mentioned at all, the name is spoken only in a whisper, and not until the mostelaborate precautions have been taken that it shall be heard by no one but members of thegroup. “The native thinks that a stranger knowing his secret name would have special powerto work him ill by means of magic.”The same fear seems to have led to a custom of the same sort amongst the ancientEgyptians, whose comparatively high civilisation was strangely dashed and chequered withrelics of the lowest savagery. Every Egyptian received two names, which were known respec-tively as the true name and the good name, or the great name and the little name; and whilethe good or little name was made public, the true or great name appears to have been care-fully concealed. A Brahman child receives two names, one for common use, the other asecret name which none but his father and mother should know. The latter is only used atceremonies such as marriage. The custom is intended to protect the person against magic,since a charm only becomes effectual in combination with the real name. Similarly, thenatives of Nias believe that harm may be done to a person by the demons who hear hisname pronounced. Hence the names of infants, who are especially exposed to the assaultsof evil sprits, are never spoken; and often in haunted spots, such as the gloomy depths of theforest, the banks of a river, or beside a bubbling spring, men will abstain from calling eachother by their names for a like reason.The Indians of Chiloe keep their names secret and do not like to have them uttered aloud; forthey say that there are fairies or imps on the mainland or neighbouring islands who, if theyknew folk’s names, would do them an injury; but so long as they do not know the names,these mischievous sprites are powerless. The Araucanians will hardly ever tell a stranger theirnames because they fear that he would thereby acquire some supernatural power over them-selves. Asked his name by a stranger, who is ignorant of their superstitions, an Araucanianwill answer, “I have none.” When an Ojebway is asked his name, he will look at somebystander and ask him to answer. “This reluctance arises from an impression they receivewhen young, that if they repeat their own names it will prevent their growth, and they will besmall in stature. On account of this unwillingness to tell their names, many strangers havefancied that they either have no names or have forgotten them.”In this last case no scruple seems to be felt about communicating a man’s name to strangers,and no ill effects appear to be dreaded as a consequence of divulging it; harm is only donewhen a name is spoken by its owner. Why is this? and why in particular should a man bethought to stunt his growth by uttering his own name? We may conjecture that to savageswho act and think thus a person’s name only seems to be a part of himself when it is utteredwith his own breath; uttered by the breath of others it has no vital connexion with him, and noharm can come to him through it. Whereas, so these primitive philosophers may haveargued, when a man lets his own name pass his lips, he is parting with a living piece of him-self, and if he persists in so reckless a course he must certainly end by dissipating his energyand shattering his constitution. Many a broken-down debauchee, many a feeble frame wastedwith disease, may have been pointed out by these simple moralists to their awe-struck disci-ples as a fearful example of the fate that must sooner or later overtake the profligate whoPage 194"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"indulges immoderately in the seductive habit of mentioning his own name.However we may explain it, the fact is certain that many a savage evinces the strongestreluctance to pronounce his own name, while at the same time he makes no objection at allto other people pronouncing it, and will even invite them to do so for him in order to satisfythe curiosity of an inquisitive stranger. Thus in some parts of Madagascar it is taboo for a per-son to tell his own name, but a slave or attendant will answer for him. The same curiousinconsistency, as it may seem to us, is recorded of some tribes of American Indians. Thus weare told that “the name of an American Indian is a sacred thing, not to be divulged by theowner himself without due consideration. One may ask a warrior of any tribe to give hisname, and the question will be met with either a point-blank refusal or the more diplomaticevasion that he cannot understand what is wanted of him. The moment a friend approaches,the warrior first interrogated will whisper what is wanted, and the friend can tell the name,receiving a reciprocation of the courtesy from the other.” This general statement applies, forexample, to the Indian tribes of British Columbia, as to whom it is said that “one of theirstrangest prejudices, which appears to pervade all tribes alike, is a dislike to telling theirnames—thus you never get a man’s right name from himself; but they will tell each other’snames without hesitation.” In the whole of the East Indian Archipelago the etiquette is thesame. As a general rule no one will utter his own name. To enquire, “What is your name?” isa very indelicate question in native society. When in the course of administrative or judicialbusiness a native is asked his name, instead of replying he will look at his comrade to indi-cate that he is to answer for him, or he will say straight out, “Ask him.” The superstition is cur-rent all over the East Indies without exception, and it is found also among the Motu andMotumotu tribes, the Papuans of Finsch Haven in North New Guinea, the Nufoors of DutchNew Guinea, and the Melanesians of the Bismarck Archipelago. Among many tribes of SouthAfrica men and women never mention their names if they can get any one else to do it forthem, but they do not absolutely refuse when it cannot be avoided.Sometimes the embargo laid on personal names is not permanent; it is conditional on circum-stances, and when these change it ceases to operate. Thus when the Nandi men are awayon a foray, nobody at home may pronounce the names of the absent warriors; they must bereferred to as birds. Should a child so far forget itself as to mention one of the distant ones byname, the mother would rebuke it, saying, “Don’t talk of the birds who are in the heavens.”Among the Bangala of the Upper Congo, while a man is fishing and when he returns with hiscatch, his proper name is in abeyance and nobody may mention it. Whatever the fisherman’sreal name may be, he is called mwele without distinction. The reason is that the river is full ofspirits, who, if they heard the fisherman’s real name, might so work against him that he wouldcatch little or nothing. Even when he has caught his fish and landed with them, the buyermust still not address him by his proper name, but must only call him mwele; for even then, ifthe spirits were to hear his proper name, they would either bear it in mind and serve him outanother day, or they might so mar the fish he had caught that he would get very little forthem. Hence the fisherman can extract heavy damages from anybody who mentions hisname, or can compel the thoughtless speaker to relieve him of the fish at a good price so asto restore his luck. When the Sulka of New Britain are near the territory of their enemies theGaktei, they take care not to mention them by their proper name, believing that were they todo so, their foes would attack and slay them. Hence in these circumstances they speak of theGaktei as o lapsiek, that is, “the rotten tree-trunks,” and they imagine that by calling them thatthey make the limbs of their dreaded enemies ponderous and clumsy like logs. This exampleillustrates the extremely materialistic view which these savages take of the nature of words;they suppose that the mere utterance of an expression signifying clumsiness will homoeo-Page 195"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"pathically affect with clumsiness the limbs of their distant foemen. Another illustration of thiscurious misconception is furnished by a Caffre superstition that the character of a young thiefcan be reformed by shouting his name over a boiling kettle of medicated water, then clappinga lid on the kettle and leaving the name to steep in the water for several days. It is not in theleast necessary that the thief should be aware of the use that is being made of his namebehind his back; the moral reformation will be effected without his knowledge.When it is deemed necessary that a man’s real name should be kept secret, it is often cus-tomary, as we have seen, to call him by a surname or nickname. As distinguished from thereal or primary names, these secondary names are apparently held to be no part of the manhimself, so that they may be freely used and divulged to everybody without endangering hissafety thereby. Sometimes in order to avoid the use of his own name a man will be calledafter his child. Thus we are informed that “the Gippsland blacks objected strongly to let anyone outside the tribe know their names, lest their enemies, learning them, should make themvehicles of incantation, and so charm their lives away. As children were not thought to haveenemies, they used to speak of a man as ‘the father, uncle, or cousin of So-and-so,’ naming achild; but on all occasions abstained from mentioning the name of a grown-up person.” TheAlfoors of Poso in Celebes will not pronounce their own names. Among them, accordingly, ifyou wish to ascertain a person’s name, you ought not to ask the man himself, but shouldenquire of others. But if this is impossible, for example, when there is no one else near, youshould ask him his child’s name, and then address him as the “Father of So-and-so.” Nay,these Alfoors are shy of uttering the names even of children; so when a boy or girl has anephew or niece, he or she is addressed as “Uncle of So-and-so,” or “Aunt of So-and-so.” Inpure Malay society, we are told, a man is never asked his name, and the custom of namingparents after their children is adopted only as a means of avoiding the use of the parents’own names. The writer who makes this statement adds in confirmation of it that childless per-sons are named after their younger brothers. Among the Land Dyaks children as they growup are called, according to their sex, the father or mother of a child of their father’s or moth-er’s younger brother or sister, that is, they are called the father or mother of what we shouldcall their first cousin. The Caffres used to think it discourteous to call a bride by her ownname, so they would call her “the Mother of So-and-so,” even when she was only betrothed,far less a wife and a mother. Among the Kukis and Zemis or Kacha Nagas of Assam parentsdrop their names after the birth of a child and are named Father and Mother of So-and-so.Childless couples go by the name of “the childless father,” “the childless mother,” “the fatherof no child,” “the mother of no child.” The widespread custom of naming a father after hischild has sometimes been supposed to spring from a desire on the father’s part to assert hispaternity, apparently as a means of obtaining those rights over his children which had previ-ously, under a system of mother-kin, been possessed by the mother. But this explanationdoes not account for the parallel custom of naming the mother after her child, which seemscommonly to co-exist with the practice of naming the father after the child. Still less, if possi-ble, does it apply to the customs of calling childless couples the father and mother of childrenwhich do not exist, of naming people after their younger brothers, and of designating childrenas the uncles and aunts of So-and-so, or as the fathers and mothers of their first cousins. Butall these practices are explained in a simple and natural way if we suppose that they originatein a reluctance to utter the real names of persons addressed or directly referred to. Thatreluctance is probably based partly on a fear of attracting the notice of evil spirits, partly on adread of revealing the name to sorcerers, who would thereby obtain a handle for injuring theowner of the name.2. NAMES OF RELATIONS TABOOEDPage 196"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"It might naturally be expected that the reserve so commonly maintained with regard to per-sonal names would be dropped or at least relaxed among relations and friends. But thereverse of this is often the case. It is precisely the persons most intimately connected byblood and especially by marriage to whom the rule applies with the greatest stringency. Suchpeople are often forbidden, not only to pronounce each other’s names, but even to utter ordi-nary words which resemble or have a single syllable in common with these names. The per-sons who are thus mutually debarred from mentioning each other’s names are especially hus-bands and wives, a man and his wife’s parents, and a woman and her husband’s father. Forexample, among the Caffres a woman may not publicly pronounce the birth-name of her hus-band or of any of his brothers, nor may she use the interdicted word in its ordinary sense. Ifher husband, for instance, be called u-Mpaka, from impaka, a small feline animal, she mustspeak of that beast by some other name. Further, a Caffre wife is forbidden to pronounceeven mentally the names of her father-in-law and of all her husband’s male relations in theascending line; and whenever the emphatic syllable of any of their names occurs in anotherword, she must avoid it by substituting either an entirely new word, or, at least, another sylla-ble in its place. Hence this custom has given rise to an almost distinct language among thewomen, which the Caffres call “women’s speech.” The interpretation of this “women’s speech”is naturally very difficult, “for no definite rules can be given for the formation of these substitut-ed words, nor is it possible to form a dictionary of them, their number being so great—sincethere may be many women, even in the same tribe, who would be no more at liberty to usethe substitutes employed by some others, than they are to use the original words them-selves.” A Caffre man, on his side, may not mention the name of his mother-in-law, nor mayshe pronounce his; but he is free to utter words in which the emphatic syllable of her nameoccurs. A Kirghiz woman dares not pronounce the names of the older relations of her hus-band, nor even use words which resemble them in sound. For example, if one of these rela-tions is called Shepherd, she may not speak of sheep, but must call them “the bleating ones”;if his name is Lamb, she must refer to lambs as “the young bleating ones.” In Southern Indiawives believe that to tell their husband’s name or to pronounce it even in a dream would bringhim to an untimely end. Among the Sea Dyaks a man may not pronounce the name of hisfather-in-law or mother-in-law without incurring the wrath of the spirits. And since he reckonsas his father-in-law and mother-in-law not only the father and mother of his own wife, but alsothe fathers and mothers of his brothers’ wives and sisters’ husbands, and likewise the fathersand mothers of all his cousins, the number of tabooed names may be very considerable andthe opportunities of error correspondingly numerous. To make confusion worse confounded,the names of persons are often the names of common things, such as moon, bridge, barley,cobra, leopard; so that when any of a man’s many fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law arecalled by such names, these common words may not pass his lips. Among the Alfoors ofMinahassa, in Celebes, the custom is carried still further so as to forbid the use even ofwords which merely resemble the personal names in sound. It is especially the name of afather-in-law which is thus laid under an interdict. If he, for example, is called Kalala, his son-in-law may not speak of a horse by its common name kawalo; he must call it a “riding-beast”(sasakajan). So among the Alfoors of the island of Buru it is taboo to mention the names ofparents and parents-in-law, or even to speak of common objects by words which resemblethese names in sound. Thus, if your mother-in-law is called Dalu, which means “betel,” youmay not ask for betel by its ordinary name, you must ask for “red mouth”; if you want betel-leaf, you may not say betel-leaf (dalu ‘mun), you must say karon fenna. In the same island itis also taboo to mention the name of an elder brother in his presence. Transgressions ofthese rules are punished with fines. In Sunda it is thought that a particular crop would bespoilt if a man were to mention the names of his father and mother.Page 197"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Among the Nufoors of Dutch New Guinea persons who are related to each other by marriageare forbidden to mention each other’s names. Among the connexions whose names are thustabooed are wife, mother-in-law, father-in-law, your wife’s uncles and aunts and also hergrand-uncles and grand-aunts, and the whole of your wife’s or your husband’s family in thesame generation as yourself, except that men may mention the names of their brothers-in-law, though women may not. The taboo comes into operation as soon as the betrothal hastaken place and before the marriage has been celebrated. Families thus connected by thebetrothal of two of their members are not only forbidden to pronounce each other’s names;they may not even look at each other, and the rule gives rise to the most comical sceneswhen they happen to meet unexpectedly. And not merely the names themselves, but anywords that sound like them are scrupulously avoided and other words used in their place. If itshould chance that a person has inadvertently uttered a forbidden name, he must at oncethrow himself on the floor and say, “I have mentioned a wrong name. I throw it through thechinks of the floor in order that I may eat well.”In the western islands of Torres Straits a man never mentioned the personal names of hisfather-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law; and a woman was subject to thesame restrictions. A brother-in-law might be spoken of as the husband or brother of some onewhose name it was lawful to mention; and similarly a sister-in-law might be called the wife ofSo-and-so. If a man by chance used the personal name of his brother-in-law, he wasashamed and hung his head. His shame was only relieved when he had made a present ascompensation to the man whose name he had taken in vain. The same compensation wasmade to a sister-in-law, a father-in-law, and a mother-in-law for the accidental mention of theirnames. Among the natives who inhabit the coast of the Gazelle Peninsula in New Britain tomention the name of a brother-in-law is the grossest possible affront you can offer to him; it isa crime punishable with death. In the Banks’ Islands, Melanesia, the taboos laid on thenames of persons connected by marriage are very strict. A man will not mention the name ofhis father-in-law, much less the name of his mother-in-law, nor may he name his wife’s broth-er; but he may name his wife’s sister—she is nothing to him. A woman may not name herfather-in-law, nor on any account her son-in-law. Two people whose children have intermar-ried are also debarred from mentioning each other’s names. And not only are all these per-sons forbidden to utter each other’s names; they may not even pronounce ordinary wordswhich chance to be either identical with these names or to have any syllables in common withthem. Thus we hear of a native of these islands who might not use the common words for“pig” and “to die,” because these words occurred in the polysyllabic name of his son-in-law;and we are told of another unfortunate who might not pronounce the everyday words for“hand” and “hot” on account of his wife’s brother’s name, and who was even debarred frommentioning the number “one,” because the word for “one” formed part of the name of hiswife’s cousin.The reluctance to mention the names or even syllables of the names of persons connectedwith the speaker by marriage can hardly be separated from the reluctance evinced by somany people to utter their own names or the names of the dead or of the dead or of chiefsand kings; and if the reticence as to these latter names springs mainly from superstition, wemay infer that the reticence as to the former has no better foundation. That the savage’sunwillingness to mention his own name is based, at least in part, on a superstitious fear of theill use that might be made of it by his foes, whether human or spiritual, has already beenshown. It remains to examine the similar usage in regard to the names of the dead and ofroyal personages.Page 198"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"3. NAMES OF THE DEAD TABOOEDThe custom of abstaining from all mention of the names of the dead was observed in antiqui-ty by the Albanians of the Caucasus, and at the present day it is in full force among manysavage tribes. Thus we are told that one of the customs most rigidly observed and enforcedamongst the Australian aborigines is never to mention the name of a deceased person,whether male or female; to name aloud one who has departed this life would be a gross vio-lation of their most sacred prejudices, and they carefully abstain from it. The chief motive forthis abstinence appears to be a fear of evoking the ghost, although the natural unwillingnessto revive past sorrows undoubtedly operates also to draw the veil of oblivion over the namesof the dead. Once Mr. Oldfield so terrified a native by shouting out the name of a deceasedperson, that the man fairly took to his heels and did not venture to show himself again forseveral days. At their next meeting he bitterly reproached the rash white man for his indiscre-tion; “nor could I,” adds Mr. Oldfield, “induce him by any means to utter the awful sound of adead man’s name, for by so doing he would have placed himself in the power of the malignspirits.” Among the aborigines of Victoria the dead were very rarely spoken of, and then neverby their names; they were referred to in a subdued voice as “the lost one” or “the poor fellowthat is no more.” To speak of them by name would, it was supposed, excite the malignity ofCouit-gil, the spirit of the departed, which hovers on earth for a time before it departs for evertowards the setting sun. Of the tribes on the Lower Murray River we are told that when a per-son dies “they carefully avoid mentioning his name; but if compelled to do so, they pronounceit in a very low whisper, so faint that they imagine the spirit cannot hear their voice.” Amongstthe tribes of Central Australia no one may utter the name of the deceased during the period ofmourning, unless it is absolutely necessary to do so, and then it is only done in a whisper forfear of disturbing and annoying the man’s spirit which is walking about in ghostly form. If theghost hears his name mentioned he concludes that his kinsfolk are not mourning for himproperly; if their grief were genuine they could not bear to bandy his name about. Touched tothe quick by their hard-hearted indifference the indignant ghost will come and trouble them indreams.The same reluctance to utter the names of the dead appears to prevail among all the Indiantribes of America from Hudson’s Bay Territory to Patagonia. Among the Goajiros of Colombiato mention the dead before his kinsmen is a dreadful offence, which is often punished withdeath; for if it happens on the rancho of the deceased, in presence of his nephew or uncle,they will assuredly kill the offender on the spot if they can. But if he escapes, the penaltyresolves itself into a heavy fine, usually of two or more oxen.Asimilar reluctance to mention the names of the dead is reported of peoples so widely sepa-rated from each other as the Samoyeds of Siberia and the Todas of Southern India; theMongols of Tartary and the Tuaregs of the Sahara; the Ainos of Japan and the Akamba andNandi of Eastern Africa; the Tinguianes of the Philippines and the inhabitants of the NicobarIslands, of Borneo, of Madagascar, and of Tasmania. In all cases, even where it is notexpressly stated, the fundamental reason for this avoidance is probably the fear of the ghost.That this is the real motive with the Tuaregs we are positively informed. They dread the returnof the dead man’s spirit, and do all they can to avoid it by shifting their camp after a death,ceasing for ever to pronounce the name of the departed, and eschewing everything thatmight be regarded as an evocation or recall of his soul. Hence they do not, like the Arabs,designate individuals by adding to their personal names the names of their fathers; theynever speak of So-and-so, son of So-and-so; they give to every man a name which will livePage 199"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"and die with him. So among some of the Victorian tribes in Australia personal names wererarely perpetuated, because the natives believed that any one who adopted the name of adeceased person would not live long; probably his ghostly namesake was supposed to comeand fetch him away to the spirit-land.The same fear of the ghost, which moves people to suppress his old name, naturally leads allpersons who bear a similar name to exchange it for another, lest its utterance should attractthe attention of the ghost, who cannot reasonably be expected to discriminate between all thedifferent applications of the same name. Thus we are told that in the Adelaide and EncounterBay tribes of South Australia the repugnance to mentioning the names of those who havedied lately is carried so far, that persons who bear the same name as the deceased abandonit, and either adopt temporary names or are known by any others that happen to belong tothem. A similar custom prevails among some of the Queensland tribes; but the prohibition touse the names of the dead is not permanent, though it may last for many years. In someAustralian tribes the change of name thus brought about is permanent; the old name is laidaside for ever, and the man is known by his new name for the rest of his life, or at least untilhe is obliged to change it again for a like reason. Among the North American Indians all per-sons, whether men or women, who bore the name of one who had just died were obliged toabandon it and to adopt other names, which was formally done at the first ceremony ofmourning for the dead. In some tribes to the east of the Rocky Mountains this change ofname lasted only during the season of mourning, but in other tribes on the Pacific Coast ofNorth America it seems to have been permanent.Sometimes by an extension of the same reasoning all the near relations of the deceasedchange their names, whatever they may happen to be, doubtless from a fear that the soundof the familiar names might lure back the vagrant spirit to its old home. Thus in someVictorian tribes the ordinary names of all the next of kin were disused during the period ofmourning, and certain general terms, prescribed by custom, were substituted for them. To calla mourner by his own name was considered an insult to the departed, and often led to fight-ing and bloodshed. Among Indian tribes of North-western America near relations of thedeceased often change their names “under an impression that spirits will be attracted back toearth if they hear familiar names often repeated.” Among the Kiowa Indians the name of thedead is never spoken in the presence of the relatives, and on the death of any member of afamily all the others take new names. This custom was noted by Raleigh’s colonists onRoanoke Island more than three centuries ago. Among the Lengua Indians not only is a deadman’s name never mentioned, but all the survivors change their names also. They say thatDeath has been among them and has carried off a list of the living, and that he will sooncome back for more victims; hence in order to defeat his fell purpose they change theirnames, believing that on his return Death, though he has got them all on his list, will not beable to identify them under their new names, and will depart to pursue the search elsewhere.Nicobarese mourners take new names in order to escape the unwelcome attentions of theghost; and for the same purpose they disguise themselves by shaving their heads so that theghost is unable to recognise them.Further, when the name of the deceased happens to be that of some common object, suchas an animal, or plant, or fire, or water, it is sometimes considered necessary to drop thatword in ordinary speech and replace it by another. A custom of this sort, it is plain, may easilybe a potent agent of change in language; for where it prevails to any considerable extentmany words must constantly become obsolete and new ones spring up. And this tendencyhas been remarked by observers who have recorded the custom in Australia, America, andPage 200"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"elsewhere. For example, with regard to the Australian aborigines it has been noted that “thedialects change with almost every tribe. Some tribes name their children after natural objects;and when the person so named dies, the word is never again mentioned; another word hastherefore to be invented for the object after which the child was called.” The writer gives as aninstance the case of a man whose name Karla signified “fire”; when Karla died, a new wordfor fire had to be introduced. “Hence,” adds the writer, “the language is always changing.”Again, in the Encounter Bay tribe of South Australia, if a man of the name of Ngnke, whichmeans “water,” were to die, the whole tribe would be obliged to use some other word toexpress water for a considerable time after his decease. The writer who records this customsurmises that it may explain the presence of a number of synonyms in the language of thetribe. This conjecture is confirmed by what we know of some Victorian tribes whose speechcomprised a regular set of synonyms to be used instead of the common terms by all mem-bers of a tribe in times of mourning. For instance, if a man called Waa ( “crow”) departed thislife, during the period of mourning for him nobody might call a crow a waa; everybody had tospeak of the bird as a narrapart. When a person who rejoiced in the title of Ringtail Opossum(weearn) had gone the way of all flesh, his sorrowing relations and the tribe at large werebound for a time to refer to ringtail opossums by the more sonorous name of manuungkuurt.If the community were plunged in grief for the loss of a respected female who bore the hon-ourable name of Turkey Bustard, the proper name for turkey bustards, which was barrim bar-rim, went out, and tillit tilliitsh came in. And so mutatis mutandis with the names of BlackCockatoo, Grey Duck, Gigantic Crane, Kangaroo, Eagle, Dingo, and the rest.Asimilar custom used to be constantly transforming the language of the Abipones ofParaguay, amongst whom, however, a word once abolished seems never to have beenrevived. New words, says the missionary Dobrizhoffer, sprang up every year like mushroomsin a night, because all words that resembled the names of the dead were abolished byproclamation and others coined in their place. The mint of words was in the hands of the oldwomen of the tribe, and whatever term they stamped with their approval and put in circulationwas immediately accepted without a murmur by high and low alike, and spread like wildfirethrough every camp and settlement of the tribe. You would be astonished, says the samemissionary, to see how meekly the whole nation acquiesces in the decision of a withered oldhag, and how completely the old familiar words fall instantly out of use and are never repeat-ed either through force of habit or forgetfulness. In the seven years that Dobrizhoffer spentamong these Indians the native word for jaguar was changed thrice, and the words for croco-dile, thorn, and the slaughter of cattle underwent similar though less varied vicissitudes. As aresult of this habit, the vocabularies of the missionaries teemed with erasures, old words hav-ing constantly to be struck out as obsolete and new ones inserted in their place. In manytribes of British New Guinea the names of persons are also the names of common things.The people believe that if the name of a deceased person is pronounced, his spirit will return,and as they have no wish to see it back among them the mention of his name is tabooed anda new word is created to take its place, whenever the name happens to be a common term ofthe language. Consequently many words are permanently lost or revived with modified ornew meanings. In the Nicobar Islands a similar practice has similarly affected the speech ofthe natives. “A most singular custom,” says Mr. de Roepstorff, “prevails among them whichone would suppose must most effectually hinder the ‘making of history,’ or, at any rate, thetransmission of historical narrative. By a strict rule, which has all the sanction of Nicobarsuperstition, no man’s name may be mentioned after his death! To such a length is this car-ried that when, as very frequently happens, the man rejoiced in the name of ‘Fowl,’ ‘Hat’,‘Fire,’ ‘Road,’ etc., in its Nicobarese equivalent, the use of these words is carefully eschewedfor the future, not only as being the personal designation of the deceased, but even as thePage 201"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"names of the common things they represent; the words die out of the language, and eithernew vocables are coined to express the thing intended, or a substitute for the disused word isfound in other Nicobarese dialects or in some foreign tongue. This extraordinary custom notonly adds an element of instability to the language, but destroys the continuity of political life,and renders the record of past events precarious and vague, if not impossible.”That a superstition which suppresses the names of the dead must cut at the very root of his-torical tradition has been remarked by other workers in this field. “The Klamath people,”observes Mr. A. S. Gatschet, “possess no historic traditions going further back in time than acentury, for the simple reason that there was a strict law prohibiting the mention of the personor acts of a deceased individual by using his name. This law was rigidly observed among theCalifornians no less than among the Oregonians, and on its transgression the death penaltycould be inflicted. This is certainly enough to suppress all historical knowledge within a peo-ple. How can history be written without names?”In many tribes, however, the power of this superstition to blot out the memory of the past is tosome extent weakened and impaired by a natural tendency of the human mind. Time, whichwears out the deepest impressions, inevitably dulls, if it does not wholly efface, the print lefton the savage mind by the mystery and horror of death. Sooner or later, as the memory of hisloved ones fades slowly away, he becomes more willing to speak of them, and thus their rudenames may sometimes be rescued by the philosophic enquirer before they have vanished,like autumn leaves or winter snows, into the vast undistinguished limbo of the past. In someof the Victorian tribes the prohibition to mention the names of the dead remained in force onlyduring the period of mourning; in the Port Lincoln tribe of South Australia it lasted manyyears. Among the Chinook Indians of North America “custom forbids the mention of a deadman’s name, at least till many years have elapsed after the bereavement.” Among thePuyallup Indians the observance of the taboo is relaxed after several years, when the mourn-ers have forgotten their grief; and if the deceased was a famous warrior, one of his descen-dants, for instance a great-grandson, may be named after him. In this tribe the taboo is notmuch observed at any time except by the relations of the dead. Similarly the Jesuit mission-ary Lafitau tells us that the name of the departed and the similar names of the survivors were,so to say, buried with the corpse until, the poignancy of their grief being abated, it pleased therelations “to lift up the tree and raise the dead.” By raising the dead they meant bestowing thename of the departed upon some one else, who thus became to all intents and purposes areincarnation of the deceased, since on the principles of savage philosophy the name is avital part, if not the soul, of the man.Among the Lapps, when a woman was with child and near the time of her delivery, adeceased ancestor or relation used to appear to her in a dream and inform her what deadperson was to be born again in her infant, and whose name the child was therefore to bear. Ifthe woman had no such dream, it fell to the father or the relatives to determine the name bydivination or by consulting a wizard. Among the Khonds a birth is celebrated on the seventhday after the event by a feast given to the priest and to the whole village. To determine thechild’s name the priest drops grains of rice into a cup of water, naming with each grain adeceased ancestor. From the movements of the seed in the water, and from observationsmade on the person of the infant, he pronounces which of his progenitors has reappeared inhim, and the child generally, at least among the northern tribes, receives the name of thatancestor. Among the Yorubas, soon after a child has been born, a priest of Ifa, the god of div-ination, appears on the scene to ascertain what ancestral soul has been reborn in the infant.As soon as this has been decided, the parents are told that the child must conform in allPage 202"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"respects to the manner of life of the ancestor who now animates him or her, and if, as oftenhappens, they profess ignorance, the priest supplies the necessary information. The childusually receives the name of the ancestor who has been born again in him.4. NAMES OF KINGS AND OTHER SACRED PERSONS TABOOEDWhen we see that in primitive society the names of mere commoners, whether alive or dead,are matters of such anxious care, we need not be surprised that great precautions should betaken to guard from harm the names of sacred kings and priests. Thus the name of the kingof Dahomey is always kept secret, lest the knowledge of it should enable some evil-mindedperson to do him a mischief. The appellations by which the different kings of Dahomey havebeen known to Europeans are not their true names, but mere titles, or what the natives call“strong names.” The natives seem to think that no harm comes of such titles being known,since they are not, like the birth-names, vitally connected with their owners. In the Galla king-dom of Ghera the birth-name of the sovereign may not be pronounced by a subject underpain of death, and common words which resemble it in sound are changed for others. Amongthe Bahima of Central Africa, when the king dies, his name is abolished from the language,and if his name was that of an animal, a new appellation must be found for the creature atonce. For example, the king is often called a lion; hence at the death of a king named Lion anew name for lions in general has to be coined. In Siam it used to be difficult to ascertain theking’s real name, since it was carefully kept secret from fear of sorcery; any one who men-tioned it was clapped into gaol. The king might only be referred to under certain high-sound-ing titles, such as “the august,” “the perfect,” “the supreme,” “the great emperor,” “descendantof the angels,” and so on. In Burma it was accounted an impiety of the deepest dye to men-tion the name of the reigning sovereign; Burmese subjects, even when they were far fromtheir country, could not be prevailed upon to do so; after his accession to the throne the kingwas known by his royal titles only.Among the Zulus no man will mention the name of the chief of his tribe or the names of theprogenitors of the chief, so far as he can remember them; nor will he utter common wordswhich coincide with or merely resemble in sound tabooed names. In the tribe of theDwandwes there was a chief called Langa, which means the sun; hence the name of the sunwas changed from langa to gala, and so remains to this day, though Langa died more than ahundred years ago. Again, in the Xnumayo tribe the word meaning “to herd cattle” waschanged from alusa or ayusa to kagesa, because u-Mayusi was the name of the chief.Besides these taboos, which were observed by each tribe separately, all the Zulu tribes unit-ed in tabooing the name of the king who reigned over the whole nation. Hence, for example,when Panda was king of Zululand, the word for “a root of a tree,” which is impando, waschanged to nxabo. Again, the word for “lies” or “slander” was altered from amacebo to amak-wata, because amacebo contains a syllable of the name of the famous King Cetchwayo.These substitutions are not, however, carried so far by the men as by the women, who omitevery sound even remotely resembling one that occurs in a tabooed name. At the king’skraal, indeed, it is sometimes difficult to understand the speech of the royal wives, as theytreat in this fashion the names not only of the king and his forefathers, but even of his andtheir brothers back for generations. When to these tribal and national taboos we add thosefamily taboos on the names of connexions by marriage which have been already described,we can easily understand how it comes about that in Zululand every tribe has words peculiarto itself, and that the women have a considerable vocabulary of their own. Members, too, ofone family may be debarred from using words employed by those of another. The women ofone kraal, for instance, may call a hyaena by its ordinary name; those of the next may usePage 203"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"the common substitute; while in a third the substitute may also be unlawful and another termmay have to be invented to supply its place. Hence the Zulu language at the present dayalmost presents the appearance of being a double one; indeed, for multitudes of things it pos-sesses three or four synonyms, which through the blending of tribes are known all overZululand.In Madagascar a similar custom everywhere prevails and has resulted, as among the Zulus,in producing certain dialectic differences in the speech of the various tribes. There are nofamily names in Madagascar, and almost every personal name is drawn from the language ofdaily life and signifies some common object or action or quality, such as a bird, a beast, atree, a plant, a colour, and so on. Now, whenever one of these common words forms thename or part of the name of the chief of the tribe, it becomes sacred and may no longer beused in its ordinary signification as the name of a tree, an insect, or what not. Hence a newname for the object must be invented to replace the one which has been discarded. It is easyto conceive what confusion and uncertainty may thus be introduced into a language when it isspoken by many little local tribes each ruled by a petty chief with his own sacred name. Yetthere are tribes and people who submit to this tyranny of words as their fathers did beforethem from time immemorial. The inconvenient results of the custom are especially marked onthe western coast of the island, where, on account of the large number of independent chief-tains, the names of things, places, and rivers have suffered so many changes that confusionoften arises, for when once common words have been banned by the chiefs the natives willnot acknowledge to have ever known them in their old sense.But it is not merely the names of living kings and chiefs which are tabooed in Madagascar;the names of dead sovereigns are equally under a ban, at least in some parts of the island.Thus among the Sakalavas, when a king has died, the nobles and people meet in councilround the dead body and solemnly choose a new name by which the deceased monarchshall be henceforth known. After the new name has been adopted, the old name by which theking was known during his life becomes sacred and may not be pronounced under pain ofdeath. Further, words in the common language which bear any resemblance to the forbiddenname also become sacred and have to be replaced by others. Persons who uttered these for-bidden words were looked on not only as grossly rude, but even as felons; they had commit-ted a capital crime. However, these changes of vocabulary are confined to the district overwhich the deceased king reigned; in the neighbouring districts the old words continue to beemployed in the old sense.The sanctity attributed to the persons of chiefs in Polynesia naturally extended also to theirnames, which on the primitive view are hardly separable from the personality of their owners.Hence in Polynesia we find the same systematic prohibition to utter the names of chiefs or ofcommon words resembling them which we have already met with in Zululand andMadagascar. Thus in New Zealand the name of a chief is held so sacred that, when it hap-pens to be a common word, it may not be used in the language, and another has to be foundto replace it. For example, a chief of the southward of East Cape bore the name of Maripi,which signified a knife, hence a new word (nekra) for knife was introduced, and the old onebecame obsolete. Elsewhere the word for water (wai) had to be changed, because it chancedto be the name of the chief, and would have been desecrated by being applied to the vulgarfluid as well as to his sacred person. This taboo naturally produced a plentiful crop of syn-onyms in the Maori language, and travellers newly arrived in the country were sometimespuzzled at finding the same things called by quite different names in neighbouring tribes.When a king comes to the throne in Tahiti, any words in the language that resemble his namePage 204"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"in sound must be changed for others. In former times, if any man were so rash as to disre-gard this custom and to use the forbidden words, not only he but all his relations were imme-diately put to death. But the changes thus introduced were only temporary; on the death ofthe king the new words fell into disuse, and the original ones were revived.In ancient Greece the names of the priests and other high officials who had to do with theperformance of the Eleusinian mysteries might not be uttered in their lifetime. To pronouncethem was a legal offence The pedant in Lucian tells how he fell in with these august person-ages haling along to the police court a ribald fellow who had dared to name them, though wellhe knew that ever since their consecration it was unlawful to do so, because they hadbecome anonymous, having lost their old names and acquired new and sacred titles. Fromtwo inscriptions found at Eleusis it appears that the names of the priests were committed tothe depths of the sea; probably they were engraved on tablets of bronze or lead, which werethen thrown into deep water in the Gulf of Salamis. The intention doubtless was to keep thenames a profound secret; and how could that be done more surely than by sinking them inthe sea? what human vision could spy them glimmering far down in the dim depths of thegreen water? A clearer illustration of the confusion between the incorporeal and the corporeal,between the name and its material embodiment, could hardly be found than in this practice ofcivilised Greece.5. NAMES OF GODS TABOOEDPrimitive man creates his gods in his own image. Xenophanes remarked long ago that thecomplexion of negro gods was black and their noses flat; that Thracian gods were ruddy andblue-eyed; and that if horses, oxen, and lions only believed in gods and had hands wherewithto portray them, they would doubtless fashion their deities in the form of horses, and oxen,and lions. Hence just as the furtive savage conceals his real name because he fears that sor-cerers might make an evil use of it, so he fancies that his gods must likewise keep their truename secret, lest other gods or even men should learn the mystic sounds and thus be able toconjure with them. Nowhere was this crude conception of the secrecy and magical virtue ofthe divine name more firmly held or more fully developed than in ancient Egypt, where thesuperstitions of a dateless past were embalmed in the hearts of the people hardly less effec-tually than the bodies of cats and crocodiles and the rest of the divine menagerie in theirrock-cut tombs. The conception is well illustrated by a story which tells how the subtle Isiswormed his secret name from Ra, the great Egyptian god of the sun. Isis, so runs the tale,was a woman mighty in words, and she was weary of the world of men, and yearned after theworld of the gods. And she meditated in her heart, saying, “Cannot I by virtue of the greatname of Ra make myself a goddess and reign like him in heaven and earth?” For Ra hadmany names, but the great name which gave him all power over gods and men was known tonone but himself. Now the god was by this time grown old; he slobbered at the mouth and hisspittle fell upon the ground. So Isis gathered up the spittle and the earth with it, and kneadedthereof a serpent and laid it in the path where the great god passed every day to his doublekingdom after his heart’s desire. And when he came forth according to his wont, attended byall his company of gods, the sacred serpent stung him, and the god opened his mouth andcried, and his cry went up to heaven. And the company of gods cried, “What aileth thee?” andthe gods shouted, “Lo and behold!” But he could not answer; his jaws rattled, his limbs shook,the poison ran through his flesh as the Nile floweth over the land. When the great god hadstilled his heart, he cried to his followers, “Come to me, O my children, offspring of my body. Iam a prince, the son of a prince, the divine seed of a god. My father devised my name; myfather and my mother gave me my name, and it remained hidden in my body since my birth,Page 205"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"that no magician might have magic power over me. I went out to behold that which I havemade, I walked in the two lands which I have created, and lo! something stung me. What itwas, I know not. Was it fire? was it water? My heart is on fire, my flesh trembleth, all my limbsdo quake. Bring me the children of the gods with healing words and understanding lips,whose power reacheth to heaven.” Then came to him the children of the gods, and they werevery sorrowful. And Isis came with her craft, whose mouth is full of the breath of life, whosespells chase pain away, whose word maketh the dead to live. She said, “What is it, divineFather? what is it?” The holy god opened his mouth, he spake and said, “I went upon myway, I walked after my heart’s desire in the two regions which I have made to behold thatwhich I have created, and lo! a serpent that I saw not stung me. Is it fire? is it water? I amcolder than water, I am hotter than fire, all my limbs sweat, I tremble, mine eye is not stead-fast, I behold not the sky, the moisture bedeweth my face as in summer-time.” Then spakeIsis, “Tell me thy name, divine Father, for the man shall live who is called by his name.” Thenanswered Ra, “I created the heavens and the earth, I ordered the mountains, I made thegreat and wide sea, I stretched out the two horizons like a curtain. I am he who openeth hiseyes and it is light, and who shutteth them and it is dark. At his command the Nile riseth, butthe gods know not his name. I am Khepera in the morning, I am Ra at noon, I am Tum ateve.” But the poison was not taken away from him; it pierced deeper, and the great god couldno longer walk. Then said Isis to him, “That was not thy name that thou spakest unto me. Ohtell it me, that the poison may depart; for he shall live whose name is named.” Now the poi-son burned like fire, it was hotter than the flame of fire. The god said, “I consent that Isis shallsearch into me, and that my name shall pass from my breast into hers.” Then the god hidhimself from the gods, and his place in the ship of eternity was empty. Thus was the name ofthe great god taken from him, and Isis, the witch, spake, “Flow away, poison, depart from Ra.It is I, even I, who overcome the poison and cast it to the earth; for the name of the great godhath been taken away from him. Let Ra live and let the poison die.” Thus spake great Isis, thequeen of the gods, she who knows Ra and his true name.From this story it appears that the real name of the god, with which his power was inextrica-bly bound up, was supposed to be lodged, in an almost physical sense, somewhere in hisbreast, from which Isis extracted it by a sort of surgical operation and transferred it with all itssupernatural powers to herself. In Egypt attempts like that of Isis to appropriate the power ofa high god by possessing herself of his name were not mere legends told of the mythicalbeings of a remote past; every Egyptian magician aspired to wield like powers by similarmeans. For it was believed that he who possessed the true name possessed the very beingof god or man, and could force even a deity to obey him as a slave obeys his master. Thusthe art of the magician consisted in obtaining from the gods a revelation of their sacrednames, and he left no stone unturned to accomplish his end. When once a god in a momentof weakness or forgetfulness had imparted to the wizard the wondrous lore, the deity had nochoice but to submit humbly to the man or pay the penalty of his contumacy.The belief in the magic virtue of divine names was shared by the Romans. When they satdown before a city, the priests addressed the guardian deity of the place in a set form ofprayer or incantation, inviting him to abandon the beleaguered city and come over to theRomans, who would treat him as well as or better than he had ever been treated in his oldhome. Hence the name of the guardian deity of Rome was kept a profound secret, lest theenemies of the republic might lure him away, even as the Romans themselves had inducedmany gods to desert, like rats, the falling fortunes of cities that had sheltered them in happierdays. Nay, the real name, not merely of its guardian deity, but of the city itself, was wrapt inmystery and might never be uttered, not even in the sacred rites. A certain Valerius Soranus,Page 206"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"who dared to divulge the priceless secret, was put to death or came to a bad end. In likemanner, it seems, the ancient Assyrians were forbidden to mention the mystic names of theircities; and down to modern times the Cheremiss of the Caucasus keep the names of theircommunal villages secret from motives of superstition.If the reader has had the patience to follow this examination of the superstitions attaching topersonal names, he will probably agree that the mystery in which the names of royal person-ages are so often shrouded is no isolated phenomenon, no arbitrary expression of courtlyservility and adulation, but merely the particular application of a general law of primitivethought, which includes within its scope common folk and gods as well as kings and priests.Chapter XXIIIOur Debt to the SavageIT would be easy to extend the list of royal and priestly taboos, but the instances collected inthe preceding pages may suffice as specimens. To conclude this part of our subject it onlyremains to state summarily the general conclusions to which our enquiries have thus far con-ducted us. We have seen that in savage or barbarous society there are often found men towhom the superstition of their fellows ascribes a controlling influence over the general courseof nature. Such men are accordingly adored and treated as gods. Whether these humandivinities also hold temporal sway over the lives and fortunes of their adorers, or whether theirfunctions are purely spiritual and supernatural, in other words, whether they are kings as wellas gods or only the latter, is a distinction which hardly concerns us here. Their supposeddivinity is the essential fact with which we have to deal. In virtue of it they are a pledge andguarantee to their worshippers of the continuance and orderly succession of those physicalphenomena upon which mankind depends for subsistence. Naturally, therefore, the life andhealth of such a god-man are matters of anxious concern to the people whose welfare andeven existence are bound up with his; naturally he is constrained by them to conform to suchrules as the wit of early man has devised for averting the ills to which flesh is heir, includingthe last ill, death. These rules, as an examination of them has shown, are nothing but themaxims with which, on the primitive view, every man of common prudence must comply if hewould live long in the land. But while in the case of ordinary men the observance of the rulesis left to the choice of the individual, in the case of the god-man it is enforced under penalty ofdismissal from his high station, or even of death. For his worshippers have far too great astake in his life to allow him to play fast and loose with it. Therefore all the quaint supersti-tions, the old-world maxims, the venerable saws which the ingenuity of savage philosopherselaborated long ago, and which old women at chimney corners still impart as treasures ofgreat price to their descendants gathered round the cottage fire on winter evenings—all theseantique fancies clustered, all these cobwebs of the brain were spun about the path of the oldking, the human god, who, immeshed in them like a fly in the toils of a spider, could hardly stira limb for the threads of custom, “light as air but strong as links of iron,” that crossing andrecrossing each other in an endless maze bound him fast within a network of observancesfrom which death or deposition alone could release him.Thus to students of the past the life of the old kings and priests teems with instruction. In itwas summed up all that passed for wisdom when the world was young. It was the perfect pat-tern after which every man strove to shape his life; a faultless model constructed with rigor-ous accuracy upon the lines laid down by a barbarous philosophy. Crude and false as thatphilosophy may seem to us, it would be unjust to deny it the merit of logical consistency.Starting from a conception of the vital principle as a tiny being or soul existing in, but distinctPage 207"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"and separable from, the living being, it deduces for the practical guidance of life a system ofrules which in general hangs well together and forms a fairly complete and harmoniouswhole. The flaw—and it is a fatal one—of the system lies not in its reasoning, but in its prem-ises; in its conception of the nature of life, not in any irrelevancy of the conclusions which itdraws from that conception. But to stigmatise these premises as ridiculous because we caneasily detect their falseness, would be ungrateful as well as unphilosophical. We stand uponthe foundation reared by the generations that have gone before, and we can but dimly realisethe painful and prolonged efforts which it has cost humanity to struggle up to the point, novery exalted one after all, which we have reached. Our gratitude is due to the nameless andforgotten toilers, whose patient thought and active exertions have largely made us what weare. The amount of new knowledge which one age, certainly which one man, can add to thecommon store is small, and it argues stupidity or dishonesty, besides ingratitude, to ignore theheap while vaunting the few grains which it may have been our privilege to add to it. There isindeed little danger at present of undervaluing the contributions which modern times and evenclassical antiquity have made to the general advancement of our race. But when we passthese limits, the case is different. Contempt and ridicule or abhorrence and denunciation aretoo often the only recognition vouchsafed to the savage and his ways. Yet of the benefactorswhom we are bound thankfully to commemorate, many, perhaps most, were savages. Forwhen all is said and done our resemblances to the savage are still far more numerous thanour differences from him; and what we have in common with him, and deliberately retain astrue and useful, we owe to our savage forefathers who slowly acquired by experience andtransmitted to us by inheritance those seemingly fundamental ideas which we are apt toregard as original and intuitive. We are like heirs to a fortune which has been handed downfor so many ages that the memory of those who built it up is lost, and its possessors for thetime being regard it as having been an original and unalterable possession of their race sincethe beginning of the world. But reflection and enquiry should satisfy us that to our predeces-sors we are indebted for much of what we thought most our own, and that their errors werenot wilful extravagances or the ravings of insanity, but simply hypotheses, justifiable as suchat the time when they were propounded, but which a fuller experience has proved to be inad-equate. It is only by the successive testing of hypotheses and rejection of the false that truthis at last elicited. After all, what we call truth is only the hypothesis which is found to workbest. Therefore in reviewing the opinions and practices of ruder ages and races we shall dowell to look with leniency upon their errors as inevitable slips made in the search for truth,and to give them the benefit of that indulgence which we ourselves may one day stand inneed of: cum excusatione itaque veteres audiendi sunt.Chapter XXIVThe Killing of the Divine King1. THE MORTALITY OF THE GODSMAN has created gods in his own likeness and being himself mortal he has naturally sup-posed his creatures to be in the same sad predicament. Thus the Greenlanders believed thata wind could kill their most powerful god, and that he would certainly die if he touched a dog.When they heard of the Christian God, they kept asking if he never died, and being informedthat he did not, they were much surprised, and said that he must be a very great god indeed.In answer to the enquiries of Colonel Dodge, a North American Indian stated that the worldwas made by the Great Spirit. Being asked which Great Spirit he meant, the good one or thebad one, “Oh, neither of them,” replied he, “the Great Spirit that made the world is dead longago. He could not possibly have lived as long as this.” A tribe in the Philippine Islands told thePage 208"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Spanish conquerors that the grave of the Creator was upon the top of Mount Cabunian.Heitsi-eibib, a god or divine hero of the Hottentots, died several times and came to life again.His graves are generally to be met with in narrow defiles between mountains. When theHottentots pass one of them, they throw a stone on it for good luck, sometimes muttering,“Give us plenty of cattle.” The grave of Zeus, the great god of Greece, was shown to visitorsin Crete as late as about the beginning of our era. The body of Dionysus was buried at Delphibeside the golden statue of Apollo, and his tomb bore the inscription, “Here lies Dionysusdead, the son of Semele.” According to one account, Apollo himself was buried at Delphi; forPythagoras is said to have carved an inscription on his tomb, setting forth how the god hadbeen killed by the python and buried under the tripod.The great gods of Egypt themselves were not exempt from the common lot. They too grewold and died. But when at a later time the discovery of the art of embalming gave a new leaseof life to the souls of the dead by preserving their bodies for an indefinite time from corruption,the deities were permitted to share the benefit of an invention which held out to gods as wellas to men a reasonable hope of immortality. Every province then had the tomb and mummyof its dead god. The mummy of Osiris was to be seen at Mendes; Thinis boasted of themummy of Anhouri; and Heliopolis rejoiced in the possession of that of Toumou. The highgods of Babylon also, though they appeared to their worshippers only in dreams and visions,were conceived to be human in their bodily shape, human in their passions, and human intheir fate; for like men they were born into the world, and like men they loved and fought anddied.2. KINGS KILLED WHEN THEIR STRENGTH FAILSIf the high gods, who dwell remote from the fret and fever of this earthly life, are yet believedto die at last, it is not to be expected that a god who lodges in a frail tabernacle of fleshshould escape the same fate, though we hear of African kings who have imagined them-selves immortal by virtue of their sorceries. Now primitive peoples, as we have seen, some-times believe that their safety and even that of the world is bound up with the life of one ofthese god-men or human incarnations of the divinity. Naturally, therefore, they take the utmostcare of his life, out of a regard for their own. But no amount of care and precaution will pre-vent the man-god from growing old and feeble and at last dying. His worshippers have to laytheir account with this sad necessity and to meet it as best they can. The danger is a formida-ble one; for if the course of nature is dependent on the man-god’s life, what catastrophes maynot be expected from the gradual enfeeblement of his powers and their final extinction indeath? There is only one way of averting these dangers. The man-god must be killed as soonas he shows symptoms that his powers are beginning to fail, and his soul must be transferredto a vigorous successor before it has been seriously impaired by the threatened decay. Theadvantages of thus putting the man-god to death instead of allowing him to die of old age anddisease are, to the savage, obvious enough. For if the man-god dies what we call a naturaldeath, it means, according to the savage, that his soul has either voluntarily departed from hisbody and refuses to return, or more commonly that it has been extracted, or at least detainedin its wanderings, by a demon or sorcerer. In any of these cases the soul of the man-god islost to his worshippers, and with it their prosperity is gone and their very existence endan-gered. Even if they could arrange to catch the soul of the dying god as it left his lips or hisnostrils and so transfer it to a successor, this would not effect their purpose; for, dying of dis-ease, his soul would necessarily leave his body in the last stage of weakness and exhaustion,and so enfeebled it would continue to drag out a languid, inert existence in any body to whichit might be transferred. Whereas by slaying him his worshippers could, in the first place, makePage 209"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"sure of catching his soul as it escaped and transferring it to a suitable successor; and, in thesecond place, by putting him to death before his natural force was abated, they would securethat the world should not fall into decay with the decay of the man-god. Every purpose, there-fore, was answered, and all dangers averted by thus killing the man-god and transferring hissoul, while yet at its prime, to a vigorous successor.The mystic kings of Fire and Water in Cambodia are not allowed to die a natural death.Hence when one of them is seriously ill and the elders think that he cannot recover, they stabhim to death. The people of Congo believed, as we have seen, that if their pontiff the Chitoméwere to die a natural death, the world would perish, and the earth, which he alone sustainedby his power and merit, would immediately be annihilated. Accordingly when he fell ill andseemed likely to die, the man who was destined to be his successor entered the pontiff’shouse with a rope or a club and strangled or clubbed him to death. The Ethiopian kings ofMeroe were worshipped as gods; but whenever the priests chose, they sent a messenger tothe king, ordering him to die, and alleging an oracle of the gods as their authority for the com-mand. This command the kings always obeyed down to the reign of Ergamenes, a contempo-rary of Ptolemy II., King of Egypt. Having received a Greek education which emancipated himfrom the superstitions of his countrymen, Ergamenes ventured to disregard the command ofthe priests, and, entering the Golden Temple with a body of soldiers, put the priests to thesword.Customs of the same sort appear to have prevailed in this part of Africa down to moderntimes. In some tribes of Fazoql the king had to administer justice daily under a certain tree. Iffrom sickness or any other cause he was unable to discharge this duty for three whole days,he was hanged on the tree in a noose, which contained two razors so arranged that when thenoose was drawn tight by the weight of the king’s body they cut his throat.Acustom of putting their divine kings to death at the first symptoms of infirmity or old age pre-vailed until lately, if indeed it is even now extinct and not merely dormant, among the Shillukof the White Nile, and in recent years it has been carefully investigated by Dr. C. G.Seligman. The reverence which the Shilluk pay to their king appears to arise chiefly from theconviction that he is a reincarnation of the spirit of Nyakang, the semi-divine hero who found-ed the dynasty and settled the tribe in their present territory. It is a fundamental article of theShilluk creed that the spirit of the divine or semi-divine Nyakang is incarnate in the reigningking, who is accordingly himself invested to some extent with the character of a divinity. Butwhile the Shilluk hold their kings in high, indeed religious reverence and take every precau-tion against their accidental death, nevertheless they cherish “the conviction that the kingmust not be allowed to become ill or senile, lest with his diminishing vigour the cattle shouldsicken and fail to bear their increase, the crops should rot in the fields, and man, stricken withdisease, should die in ever-increasing numbers.” To prevent these calamities it used to be theregular custom with the Shilluk to put the king to death whenever he showed signs of ill-health or failing strength. One of the fatal symptoms of decay was taken to be an incapacityto satisfy the sexual passions of his wives, of whom he has very many, distributed in a largenumber of houses at Fashoda. When this ominous weakness manifested itself, the wivesreported it to the chiefs, who are popularly said to have intimated to the king his doom byspreading a white cloth over his face and knees as he lay slumbering in the heat of the sultryafternoon. Execution soon followed the sentence of death. A hut was specially built for theoccasion: the king was led into it and lay down with his head resting on the lap of a nubile vir-gin: the door of the hut was then walled up; and the couple were left without food, water, orfire to die of hunger and suffocation. This was the old custom, but it was abolished some fivePage 210"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"generations ago on account of the excessive sufferings of one of the kings who perished inthis way. It is said that the chiefs announce his fate to the king, and that afterwards he isstrangled in a hut which has been specially built for the occasion.From Dr. Seligman’s enquiries it appears that not only was the Shilluk king liable to be killedwith due ceremony at the first symptoms of incipient decay, but even while he was yet in theprime of health and strength he might be attacked at any time by a rival and have to defendhis crown in a combat to the death. According to the common Shilluk tradition any son of aking had the right thus to fight the king in possession and, if he succeeded in killing him, toreign in his stead. As every king had a large harem and many sons, the number of possiblecandidates for the throne at any time may well have been not inconsiderable, and the reign-ing monarch must have carried his life in his hand. But the attack on him could only takeplace with any prospect of success at night; for during the day the king surrounded himselfwith his friends and bodyguards, and an aspirant to the throne could hardly hope to cut hisway through them and strike home. It was otherwise at night. For then the guards were dis-missed and the king was alone in his enclosure with his favourite wives, and there was noman near to defend him except a few herdsmen, whose huts stood a little way off. The hoursof darkness were therefore the season of peril for the king. It is said that he used to passthem in constant watchfulness, prowling round his huts fully armed, peering into the blackestshadows, or himself standing silent and alert, like a sentinel on duty, in some dark corner.When at last his rival appeared, the fight would take place in grim silence, broken only by theclash of spears and shields, for it was a point of honour with the king not to call the herdsmento his assistance.Like Nyakang himself, their founder, each of the Shilluk kings after death is worshipped at ashrine, which is erected over his grave, and the grave of a king is always in the village wherehe was born. The tomb-shrine of a king resembles the shrine of Nyakang, consisting of a fewhuts enclosed by a fence; one of the huts is built over the king’s grave, the others are occu-pied by the guardians of the shrine. Indeed the shrines of Nyakang and the shrines of thekings are scarcely to be distinguished from each other, and the religious rituals observed atall of them are identical in form and vary only in matters of detail, the variations being dueapparently to the far greater sanctity attributed to the shrines of Nyakang. The grave-shrinesof the kings are tended by certain old men or women, who correspond to the guardians of theshrines of Nyakang. They are usually widows or old men-servants of the deceased king, andwhen they die they are succeeded in their office by their descendants. Moreover, cattle arededicated to the grave-shrines of the kings and sacrifices are offered at them just as at theshrines of Nyakang.In general the principal element in the religion of the Shilluk would seem to be the worshipwhich they pay to their sacred or divine kings, whether dead or alive. These are believed tobe animated by a single divine spirit, which has been transmitted from the semi-mythical, butprobably in substance historical, founder of the dynasty through all his successors to thepresent day. Hence, regarding their kings as incarnate divinities on whom the welfare of men,of cattle, and of the corn implicitly depends, the Shilluk naturally pay them the greatestrespect and take every care of them; and however strange it may seem to us, their custom ofputting the divine king to death as soon as he shows signs of ill-health or failing strengthsprings directly from their profound veneration for him and from their anxiety to preserve him,or rather the divine spirit by which he is animated, in the most perfect state of efficiency: nay,we may go further and say that their practice of regicide is the best proof they can give of thehigh regard in which they hold their kings. For they believe, as we have seen, that the king’sPage 211"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"life or spirit is so sympathetically bound up with the prosperity of the whole country, that if hefell ill or grew senile the cattle would sicken and cease to multiply, the crops would rot in thefields, and men would perish of widespread disease. Hence, in their opinion, the only way ofaverting these calamities is to put the king to death while he is still hale and hearty, in orderthat the divine spirit which he has inherited from his predecessors may be transmitted in turnby him to his successor while it is still in full vigour and has not yet been impaired by theweakness of disease and old age. In this connexion the particular symptom which is com-monly said to seal the king’s death-warrant is highly significant; when he can no longer satisfythe passions of his numerous wives, in other words, when he has ceased, whether partially orwholly, to be able to reproduce his kind, it is time for him to die and to make room for a morevigorous successor. Taken along with the other reasons which are alleged for putting the kingto death, this one suggests that the fertility of men, of cattle, and of the crops is believed todepend sympathetically on the generative power of the king, so that the complete failure ofthat power in him would involve a corresponding failure in men, animals, and plants, andwould thereby entail at no distant date the entire extinction of all life, whether human, animal,or vegetable. No wonder, that with such a danger before their eyes the Shilluk should bemost careful not to let the king die what we should call a natural death of sickness or old age.It is characteristic of their attitude towards the death of the kings that they refrain from speak-ing of it as death: they do not say that a king has died but simply that he has “gone away” likehis divine ancestors Nyakang and Dag, the two first kings of the dynasty, both of whom arereported not to have died but to have disappeared. The similar legends of the mysterious dis-appearance of early kings in other lands, for example at Rome and in Uganda, may well pointto a similar custom of putting them to death for the purpose of preserving their life.On the whole the theory and practice of the divine kings of the Shilluk correspond very nearlyto the theory and practice of the priests of Nemi, the Kings of the Wood, if my view of the lat-ter is correct. In both we see a series of divine kings on whose life the fertility of men, of cat-tle, and of vegetation is believed to depend, and who are put to death, whether in single com-bat or otherwise, in order that their divine spirit may be transmitted to their successors in fullvigour, uncontaminated by the weakness and decay of sickness or old age, because anysuch degeneration on the part of the king would, in the opinion of his worshippers, entail acorresponding degeneration on manking, on cattle, and on the crops. Some points in thisexplanation of the custom of putting divine kings to death, particularly the method of transmit-ting their divine souls to their successors, will be dealt with more fully in the sequel. Meantimewe pass to other examples of the general practice.The Dinka are a congeries of independent tribes in the valley of the White Nile. They areessentially a pastoral people, passionately devoted to the care of their numerous herds ofoxen, though they also keep sheep and goats, and the women cultivate small quantities ofmillet and sesame. For their crops and above all for their pastures they depend on the regu-larity of the rains: in seasons of prolonged drought they are said to be reduced to greatextremities. Hence the rain-maker is a very important personage among them to this day;indeed the men in authority whom travellers dub chiefs or sheikhs are in fact the actual orpotential rain-makers of the tribe or community. Each of them is believed to be animated bythe spirit of a great rain-maker, which has come down to him through a succession of rain-makers; and in virtue of this inspiration a successful rain-maker enjoys very great power andis consulted on all important matters. Yet in spite, or rather in virtue, of the high honour inwhich he is held, no Dinka rain-maker is allowed to die a natural death of sickness or old age;for the Dinka believe that if such an untoward event were to happen, the tribe would sufferfrom disease and famine, and the herds would not yield their increase. So when a rain-makerPage 212"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"feels that he is growing old and infirm, he tells his children that he wishes to die. Among theAgar Dinka a large grave is dug and the rain-maker lies down in it, surrounded by his friendsand relatives. From time to time he speaks to the people, recalling the past history of thetribe, reminding them how he has ruled and advised them, and instructing them how they areto act in the future. Then, when he has concluded his admonition, he bids them cover him up.So the earth is thrown down on him as he lies in the grave, and he soon dies of suffocation.Such, with minor variations, appears to be the regular end of the honourable career of a rain-maker in all the Dinka tribes. The Khor-Adar Dinka told Dr. Seligman that when they have dugthe grave for their rain-maker they strangle him in his house. The father and paternal uncle ofone of Dr. Seligman’s informants had both been rain-makers and both had been killed in themost regular and orthodox fashion. Even if a rain-maker is quite young he will be put to deathshould he seem likely to perish of disease. Further, every precaution is taken to prevent arain-maker from dying an accidental death, for such an end, though not nearly so serious amatter as death from illness or old age, would be sure to entail sickness on the tribe. As soonas a rain-maker is killed, his valuable spirit is supposed to pass to a suitable successor,whether a son or other near blood relation.In the Central African kingdom of Bunyoro down to recent years custom required that as soonas the king fell seriously ill or began to break up from age, he should die by his own hand; for,according to an old prophecy, the throne would pass away from the dynasty if ever the kingwere to die a natural death. He killed himself by draining a poisoned cup. If he faltered orwere too ill to ask for the cup, it was his wife’s duty to administer the poison. When the king ofKibanga, on the Upper Congo, seems near his end, the sorcerers put a rope round his neck,which they draw gradually tighter till he dies. If the king of Gingiro happens to be wounded inwar, he is put to death by his comrades, or, if they fail to kill him, by his kinsfolk, howeverhard he may beg for mercy. They say they do it that he may not die by the hands of his ene-mies. The Jukos are a heathen tribe of the Benue River, a great tributary of the Niger. In theircountry “the town of Gatri is ruled by a king who is elected by the big men of the town as fol-lows. When in the opinion of the big men the king has reigned long enough, they give out that‘the king is sick’—a formula understood by all to mean that they are going to kill him, thoughthe intention is never put more plainly. They then decide who is to be the next king. How longhe is to reign is settled by the influential men at a meeting; the question is put and answeredby each man throwing on the ground a little piece of stick for each year he thinks the newking should rule. The king is then told, and a great feast prepared, at which the king getsdrunk on guinea-corn beer. After that he is speared, and the man who was chosen becomesking. Thus each Juko king knows that he cannot have very many more years to live, and thathe is certain of his predecessor’s fate. This, however, does not seem to frighten candidates.The same custom of king-killing is said to prevail at Quonde and Wukari as well as at Gatri.”In the three Hausa kingdoms of Gobir, Katsina, and Daura, in Northern Nigeria, as soon as aking showed signs of failing health or growing infirmity, an official who bore the title of Killer ofthe Elephant appeared and throttled him.The Matiamvo is a great king or emperor in the interior of Angola. One of the inferior kings ofthe country, by name Challa, gave to a Portuguese expedition the following account of themanner in which the Matiamvo comes by his end. “It has been customary,” he said, “for ourMatiamvos to die either in war or by a violent death, and the present Matiamvo must meetthis last fate, as, in consequence of his great exactions, he has lived long enough. When wecome to this understanding, and decide that he should be killed, we invite him to make warwith our enemies, on which occasion we all accompany him and his family to the war, whenwe lose some of our people. If he escapes unhurt, we return to the war again and fight forPage 213"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"three or four days. We then suddenly abandon him and his family to their fate, leaving him inthe enemy’s hands. Seeing himself thus deserted, he causes his throne to be erected, and,sitting down, calls his family around him. He then orders his mother to approach; she kneelsat his feet; he first cuts off her head, then decapitates his sons in succession, next his wivesand relatives, and, last of all, his most beloved wife, called Anacullo. This slaughter beingaccomplished, the Matiamvo, dressed in all his pomp, awaits his own death, which immedi-ately follows, by an officer sent by the powerful neighbouring chiefs, Caniquinha and Canica.This officer first cuts off his legs and arms at the joints, and lastly he cuts off his head; afterwhich the head of the officer is struck off. All the potentates retire from the encampment, inorder not to witness his death. It is my duty to remain and witness his death, and to mark theplace where the head and arms have been deposited by the two great chiefs, the enemies ofthe Matiamvo. They also take possession of all the property belonging to the deceasedmonarch and his family, which they convey to their own residence. I then provide for thefuneral of the mutilated remains of the late Matiamvo, after which I retire to his capital andproclaim the new government. I then return to where the head, legs, and arms have beendeposited, and, for forty slaves, I ransom them, together with the merchandise and otherproperty belonging to the deceased, which I give up to the new Matiamvo, who has been pro-claimed. This is what has happened to many Matiamvos, and what must happen to the pres-ent one.” It appears to have been a Zulu custom to put the king to death as soon as he began to havewrinkles or grey hairs. At least this seems implied in the following passage written by one whoresided for some time at the court of the notorious Zulu tyrant Chaka, in the early part of thenineteenth century: “The extraordinary violence of the king’s rage with me was mainly occa-sioned by that absurd nostrum, the hair oil, with the notion of which Mr. Farewell hadimpressed him as being a specific for removing all indications of age. From the first momentof his having heard that such a preparation was attainable, he evinced a solicitude to procureit, and on every occasion never forgot to remind us of his anxiety respecting it; more especial-ly on our departure on the mission his injunctions were particularly directed to this object. Itwill be seen that it is one of the barbarous customs of the Zoolas in their choice or election oftheir kings that he must neither have wrinkles nor grey hairs, as they are both distinguishingmarks of disqualification for becoming a monarch of a warlike people. It is also equally indis-pensable that their king should never exhibit those proofs of having become unfit and incom-petent to reign; it is therefore important that they should conceal these indications so long asthey possibly can. Chaka had become greatly apprehensive of the approach of grey hairs;which would at once be the signal for him to prepare to make his exit from this sublunaryworld, it being always followed by the death of the monarch.” The writer to whom we areindebted for this instructive anecdote of the hair oil omits to specify the mode in which a grey-haired and wrinkled Zulu chief used “to make his exit from this sublunary world”; but on anal-ogy we may conjecture that he was killed.The custom of putting kings to death as soon as they suffered from any personal defect pre-vailed two centuries ago in the Caffre kingdom of Sofala. We have seen that these kings ofSofala were regarded as gods by their people, being entreated to give rain or sunshine,according as each might be wanted. Nevertheless a slight bodily blemish, such as the loss ofa tooth, was considered a sufficient cause for putting one of these god-men to death, as welearn from the following passage of an old Portuguese historian: “It was formerly the customof the kings of this land to commit suicide by taking poison when any disaster or natural phys-ical defect fell upon them, such as impotence, infectious disease, the loss of their front teeth,by which they were disfigured, or any other deformity or affliction. To put an end to suchPage 214"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"defects they killed themselves, saying that the king should be free from any blemish, and ifnot, it was better for his honour that he should die and seek another life where he would bemade whole, for there everything was perfect. But the Quiteve (king) who reigned when I wasin those parts would not imitate his predecessors in this, being discreet and dreaded as hewas; for having lost a front tooth he caused it to be proclaimed throughout the kingdom thatall should be aware that he had lost a tooth and should recognise him when they saw himwithout it, and if his predecessors killed themselves for such things they were very foolish,and he would not do so; on the contrary, he would be very sorry when the time came for himto die a natural death, for his life was very necessary to preserve his kingdom and defend itfrom his enemies; and he recommended his successors to follow his example.”The king of Sofala who dared to survive the loss of his front tooth was thus a bold reformerlike Ergamenes, king of Ethiopia. We may conjecture that the ground for putting the Ethiopiankings to death was, as in the case of the Zulu and Sofala kings, the appearance on their per-son of any bodily defect or sign of decay; and that the oracle which the priests alleged as theauthority for the royal execution was to the effect that great calamities would result from thereign of a king who had any blemish on his body; just as an oracle warned Sparta against a“lame reign,” that is, the reign of a lame king. It is some confirmation of this conjecture thatthe kings of Ethiopia were chosen for their size, strength, and beauty long before the customof killing them was abolished. To this day the Sultan of Wadai must have no obvious bodilydefect, and the king of Angoy cannot be crowned if he has a single blemish, such as a brokenor a filed tooth or the scar of an old wound. According to the Book of Acaill and many otherauthorities no king who was afflicted with a personal blemish might reign over Ireland at Tara.Hence, when the great King Cormac Mac Art lost one eye by an accident, he at once abdicat-ed.Many days’ journey to the north-east of Abomey, the old capital of Dahomey, lies the kingdomof Eyeo. “The Eyeos are governed by a king, no less absolute than the king of Dahomey, yetsubject to a regulation of state, at once humiliating and extraordinary. When the people haveconceived an opinion of his ill-government, which is sometimes insidiously infused into themby the artifice of his discontented ministers, they send a deputation to him with a present ofparrots’ eggs, as a mark of its authenticity, to represent to him that the burden of governmentmust have so far fatigued him that they consider it full time for him to repose from his caresand indulge himself with a little sleep. He thanks his subjects for their attention to his ease,retires to his own apartment as if to sleep, and there gives directions to his women to stranglehim. This is immediately executed, and his son quietly ascends the throne upon the usualterms of holding the reins of government no longer than whilst he merits the approbation ofthe people.” About the year 1774, a king of Eyeo, whom his ministers attempted to remove inthe customary manner, positively refused to accept the proffered parrots’ eggs at their hands,telling them that he had no mind to take a nap, but on the contrary was resolved to watch forthe benefit of his subjects. The ministers, surprised and indignant at his recalcitrancy, raised arebellion, but were defeated with great slaughter, and thus by his spirited conduct the kingfreed himself from the tyranny of his councillors and established a new precedent for theguidance of his successors. However, the old custom seems to have revived and persisteduntil late in the nineteenth century, for a Catholic missionary, writing in 1884, speaks of thepractice as if it were still in vogue. Another missionary, writing in 1881, thus describes theusage of the Egbas and the Yorubas of West Africa: “Among the customs of the country oneof the most curious is unquestionably that of judging, and punishing the king. Should he haveearned the hatred of his people by exceeding his rights, one of his councillors, on whom theheavy duty is laid, requires of the prince that he shall ‘go to sleep,’ which means simply ‘takePage 215"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"poison and die.’ If his courage fails him at the supreme moment, a friend renders him this lastservice, and quietly, without betraying the secret, they prepare the people for the news of theking’s death. In Yoruba the thing is managed a little differently. When a son is born to the kingof Oyo, they make a model of the infant’s right foot in clay and keep it in the house of the eld-ers (ogboni). If the king fails to observe the customs of the country, a messenger, withoutspeaking a word, shows him his child’s foot. The king knows what that means. He takes poi-son and goes to sleep.” The old Prussians acknowledged as their supreme lord a ruler whogoverned them in the name of the gods, and was known as “God’s Mouth.” When he felt him-self weak and ill, if he wished to leave a good name behind him, he had a great heap madeof thorn-bushes and straw, on which he mounted and delivered a long sermon to the people,exhorting them to serve the gods and promising to go to the gods and speak for the people.Then he took some of the perpetual fire which burned in front of the holy oak-tree, and light-ing the pile with it burned himself to death.3. KINGS KILLED AT THE END OF A FIXED TERMIn the cases hitherto described, the divine king or priest is suffered by his people to retainoffice until some outward defect, some visible symptom of failing health or advancing age,warns them that he is no longer equal to the discharge of his divine duties; but not until suchsymptoms have made their appearance is he put to death. Some peoples, however, appearto have thought it unsafe to wait for even the slightest symptom of decay and have preferredto kill the king while he was still in the full vigour of life. Accordingly, they have fixed a termbeyond which he might not reign, and at the close of which he must die, the term fixed uponbeing short enough to exclude the probability of his degenerating physically in the interval. Insome parts of Southern India the period fixed was twelve years. Thus, according to an oldtraveller, in the province of Quilacare, “there is a Gentile house of prayer, in which there is anidol which they hold in great account, and every twelve years they celebrate a great feast toit, whither all the Gentiles go as to a jubilee. This temple possesses many lands and muchrevenue: it is a very great affair. This province has a king over it, who has not more thantwelve years to reign from jubilee to jubilee. His manner of living is in this wise, that is to say:when the twelve years are completed, on the day of this feast there assemble together innu-merable people, and much money is spent in giving food to Bramans. The king has a woodenscaffolding made, spread over with silken hangings: and on that day he goes to bathe at atank with great ceremonies and sound of music, after that he comes to the idol and prays toit, and mounts on to the scaffolding, and there before all the people he takes some very sharpknives, and begins to cut off his nose, and then his ears, and his lips, and all his members,and as much flesh off himself as he can; and he throws it away very hurriedly until so muchof his blood is spilled that he begins to faint, and then he cuts his throat himself. And he per-forms this sacrifice to the idol, and whoever desires to reign another twelve years and under-take this martyrdom for love of the idol, has to be present looking on at this: and from thatplace they raise him up as king.”The king of Calicut, on the Malabar coast, bears the title of Samorin or Samory. He “pretendsto be of a higher rank than the Brahmans, and to be inferior only to the invisible gods; a pre-tention that was acknowledged by his subjects, but which is held as absurd and abominableby the Brahmans, by whom he is only treated as a Sudra.” Formerly the Samorin had to cuthis throat in public at the end of a twelve years’ reign. But towards the end of the seventeenthcentury the rule had been modified as follows: “Many strange customs were observed in thiscountry in former times, and some very odd ones are still continued. It was an ancient customfor the Samorin to reign but twelve years, and no longer. If he died before his term wasPage 216"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"expired, it saved him a troublesome ceremony of cutting his own throat, on a publick scaffolderected for the purpose. He first made a feast for all his nobility and gentry, who are verynumerous. After the feast he saluted his guests, and went on the scaffold, and very decentlycut his own throat in the view of the assembly, and his body was, a little while after, burnedwith great pomp and ceremony, and the grandees elected a new Samorin. Whether that cus-tom was a religious or a civil ceremony, I know not, but it is now laid aside. And a new customis followed by the modern Samorins, that jubilee is proclaimed throughout his dominions, atthe end of twelve years, and a tent is pitched for him in a spacious plain, and a great feast iscelebrated for ten or twelve days, with mirth and jollity, guns firing night and day, so at theend of the feast any four of the guests that have a mind to gain a crown by a desperateaction, in fighting their way through 30 or 40,000 of his guards, and kill the Samorin in histent, he that kills him succeeds him in his empire. In anno 1695, one of those jubilees hap-pened, and the tent pitched near Pennany, a seaport of his, about fifteen leagues to thesouthward of Calicut. There were but three men that would venture on that desperate action,who fell in, with sword and target, among the guard, and, after they had killed and woundedmany, were themselves killed. One of the desperados had a nephew of fifteen or sixteenyears of age, that kept close by his uncle in the attack on the guards, and, when he saw himfall, the youth got through the guards into the tent, and made a stroke at his Majesty’s head,and had certainly despatched him if a large brass lamp which was burning over his head hadnot marred the blow; but, before he could make another, he was killed by the guards; and, Ibelieve, the same Samorin reigns yet. I chanced to come that time along the coast and heardthe guns for two or three days and nights successively.”The English traveller, whose account I have quoted, did not himself witness the festival hedescribes, though he heard the sound of the firing in the distance. Fortunately, exact recordsof these festivals and of the number of men who perished at them have been preserved inthe archives of the royal family at Calicut. In the latter part of the nineteenth century theywere examined by Mr. W. Logan, with the personal assistance of the reigning king, and fromhis work it is possible to gain an accurate conception both of the tragedy and of the scenewhere it was periodically enacted down to 1743, when the ceremony took place for the lasttime.The festival at which the king of Calicut staked his crown and his life on the issue of battlewas known as the “Great Sacrifice.” It fell every twelfth year, when the planet Jupiter was inretrograde motion in the sign of the Crab, and it lasted twenty-eight days, culminating at thetime of the eighth lunar asterism in the month of Makaram. As the date of the festival wasdetermined by the position of Jupiter in the sky, and the interval between two festivals wastwelve years, which is roughly Jupiter’s period of revolution round the sun, we may conjecturethat the splendid planet was supposed to be in a special sense the king’s star and to rule hisdestiny, the period of its revolution in heaven corresponding to the period of his reign onearth. However that may be, the ceremony was observed with great pomp at the Tirunavayitemple, on the north bank of the Ponnani River. The spot is close to the present railway line.As the train rushes by, you can just catch a glimpse of the temple, almost hidden behind aclump of trees on the river bank. From the western gateway of the temple a perfectly straightroad, hardly raised above the level of the surrounding rice-fields and shaded by a fineavenue, runs for half a mile to a high ridge with a precipitous bank, on which the outlines ofthree or four terraces can still be traced. On the topmost of these terraces the king took hisstand on the eventful day. The view which it commands is a fine one. Across the flat expanseof the rice-fields, with the broad placid river winding through them, the eye ranges eastwardto high tablelands, their lower slopes embowered in woods, while afar off looms the greatPage 217"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"chain of the western Ghauts, and in the furthest distance the Neilgherries or Blue Mountains,hardly distinguishable from the azure of the sky above.But it was not to the distant prospect that the king’s eyes naturally turned at this crisis of hisfate. His attention was arrested by a spectacle nearer at hand. For all the plain below wasalive with troops, their banners waving gaily in the sun, the white tents of their many campsstanding sharply out against the green and gold of the ricefields. Forty thousand fighting menor more were gathered there to defend the king. But if the plain swarmed with soldiers, theroad that cuts across it from the temple to the king’s stand was clear of them. Not a soul wasstirring on it. Each side of the way was barred by palisades, and from the palisades on eitherhand a long hedge of spears, held by strong arms, projected into the empty road, their bladesmeeting in the middle and forming a glittering arch of steel. All was now ready. The kingwaved his sword. At the same moment a great chain of massy gold, enriched with bosses,was placed on an elephant at his side. That was the signal. On the instant a stir might beseen half a mile away at the gate of the temple. A group of swordsmen, decked with flowersand smeared with ashes, has stepped out from the crowd. They have just partaken of theirlast meal on earth, and they now receive the last blessings and farewells of their friends. Amoment more and they are coming down the lane of spears, hewing and stabbing right andleft at the spearmen, winding and turning and writhing among the blades as if they had nobones in their bodies. It is all in vain. One after the other they fall, some nearer the king,some farther off, content to die, not for the shadow of a crown, but for the mere sake ofapproving their dauntless valour and swordsmanship to the world. On the last days of the fes-tival the same magnificent display of gallantry, the same useless sacrifice of life was repeatedagain and again. Yet perhaps no sacrifice is wholly useless which proves that there are menwho prefer honour to life.“It is a singular custom in Bengal,” says an old native historian of India, “that there is little ofhereditary descent in succession to the sovereignty.... Whoever kills the king, and succeedsin placing himself on that throne, is immediately acknowledged as king; all the amirs, wazirs,soldiers, and peasants instantly obey and submit to him, and consider him as being as muchtheir sovereign as they did their former prince, and obey his orders implicitly. The people ofBengal say, ‘We are faithful to the throne; whoever fills the throne we are obedient and true toit.’” A custom of the same sort formerly prevailed in the little kingdom of Passier, on the north-ern coast of Sumatra. The old Portuguese historian De Barros, who informs us of it, remarkswith surprise that no wise man would wish to be king of Passier, since the monarch was notallowed by his subjects to live long. From time to time a sort of fury seized the people, andthey marched through the streets of the city chanting with loud voices the fatal words, “Theking must die!” When the king heard that song of death he knew that his hour had come. Theman who struck the fatal blow was of the royal lineage, and as soon as he had done the deedof blood and seated himself on the throne he was regarded as the legitimate king, providedthat he contrived to maintain his seat peaceably for a single day. This, however, the regicidedid not always succeed in doing. When Fernão Peres d’Andrade, on a voyage to China, putin at Passier for a cargo of spices, two kings were massacred, and that in the most peaceableand orderly manner, without the smallest sign of tumult or sedition in the city, where every-thing went on in its usual course, as if the murder or execution of a king were a matter ofeveryday occurrence. Indeed, on one occasion three kings were raised to the dangerous ele-vation and followed each other in the dusty road of death in a single day. The people defend-ed the custom, which they esteemed very laudable and even of divine institution, by sayingthat God would never allow so high and mighty a being as a king, who reigned as hisvicegerent on earth, to perish by violence unless for his sins he thoroughly deserved it. FarPage 218"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"away from the tropical island of Sumatra a rule of the same sort appears to have obtainedamong the old Slavs. When the captives Gunn and Jarmerik contrived to slay the king andqueen of the Slavs and made their escape, they were pursued by the barbarians, who shout-ed after them that if they would only come back they would reign instead of the murderedmonarch, since by a public statute of the ancients the succession to the throne fell to theking’s assassin. But the flying regicides turned a deaf ear to promises which they regarded asmere baits to lure them back to destruction; they continued their flight, and the shouts andclamour of the barbarians gradually died away in the distance.When kings were bound to suffer death, whether at their own hands or at the hands of others,on the expiration of a fixed term of years, it was natural that they should seek to delegate thepainful duty, along with some of the privileges of sovereignty, to a substitute who should suffervicariously in their stead. This expedient appears to have been resorted to by some of theprinces of Malabar. Thus we are informed by a native authority on that country that “in someplaces all powers both executive and judicial were delegated for a fixed period to natives bythe sovereign. This institution was styled Thalavettiparothiam or authority obtained by decapi-tation.... It was an office tenable for five years during which its bearer was invested withsupreme despotic powers within his jurisdiction. On the expiry of the five years the man’shead was cut off and thrown up in the air amongst a large concourse of villagers, each ofwhom vied with the other in trying to catch it in its course down. He who succeeded wasnominated to the post for the next five years.”When once kings, who had hitherto been bound to die a violent death at the end of a term ofyears, conceived the happy thought of dying by deputy in the persons of others, they wouldvery naturally put it in practice; and accordingly we need not wonder at finding so popular anexpedient, or traces of it, in many lands. Scandinavian traditions contain some hints that ofold the Swedish kings reigned only for periods of nine years, after which they were put todeath or had to find a substitute to die in their stead. Thus Aun or On, king of Sweden, is saidto have sacrificed to Odin for length of days and to have been answered by the god that heshould live so long as he sacrificed one of his sons every ninth year. He sacrificed nine ofthem in this manner, and would have sacrificed the tenth and last, but the Swedes would notallow him. So he died and was buried in a mound at Upsala. Another indication of a similartenure of the crown occurs in a curious legend of the deposition and banishment of Odin.Offended at his misdeeds, the other gods outlawed and exiled him, but set up in his place asubstitute, Oller by name, a cunning wizard, to whom they accorded the symbols both of roy-alty and of godhead. The deputy bore the name of Odin, and reigned for nearly ten years,when he was driven from the throne, while the real Odin came to his own again. His discom-fited rival retired to Sweden and was afterwards slain in an attempt to repair his shattered for-tunes. As gods are often merely men who loom large through the mists of tradition, we mayconjecture that this Norse legend preserves a confused reminiscence of ancient Swedishkings who reigned for nine or ten years together, then abdicated, delegating to others theprivilege of dying for their country. The great festival which was held at Upsala every nineyears may have been the occasion on which the king or his deputy was put to death. Weknow that human sacrifices formed part of the rites.There are some grounds for believing that the reign of many ancient Greek kings was limitedto eight years, or at least that at the end of every period of eight years a new consecration, afresh outpouring of the divine grace, was regarded as necessary in order to enable them todischarge their civil and religious duties. Thus it was a rule of the Spartan constitution thatevery eighth year the ephors should choose a clear and moonless night and sitting downPage 219"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"observe the sky in silence. If during their vigil they saw a meteor or shooting star, theyinferred that the king had sinned against the deity, and they suspended him from his functionsuntil the Delphic or Olympic oracle should reinstate him in them. This custom, which has allthe air of great antiquity, was not suffered to remain a dead letter even in the last period ofthe Spartan monarchy; for in the third century before our era a king, who had rendered him-self obnoxious to the reforming party, was actually deposed on various trumped-up charges,among which the allegation that the ominous sign had been seen in the sky took a prominentplace.If the tenure of the regal office was formerly limited among the Spartans to eight years, wemay naturally ask, why was that precise period selected as the measure of a king’s reign?The reason is probably to be found in those astronomical considerations which determinedthe early Greek calendar. The difficulty of reconciling lunar with solar time is one of the stand-ing puzzles which has taxed the ingenuity of men who are emerging from barbarism. Now anoctennial cycle is the shortest period at the end of which sun and moon really mark timetogether after overlapping, so to say, throughout the whole of the interval. Thus, for example,it is only once in every eight years that the full moon coincides with the longest or shortestday; and as this coincidence can be observed with the aid of a simple dial, the observation isnaturally one of the first to furnish a base for a calendar which shall bring lunar and solartimes into tolerable, though not exact, harmony. But in early days the proper adjustment ofthe calendar is a matter of religious concern, since on it depends a knowledge of the rightseasons for propitiating the deities whose favour is indispensable to the welfare of the com-munity. No wonder, therefore, that the king, as the chief priest of the state, or as himself agod, should be liable to deposition or death at the end of an astronomical period. When thegreat luminaries had run their course on high, and were about to renew the heavenly race, itmight well be thought that the king should renew his divine energies, or prove them unabated,under pain of making room for a more vigorous successor. In Southern India, as we haveseen, the king’s reign and life terminated with the revolution of the planet Jupiter round thesun. In Greece, on the other hand, the king’s fate seems to have hung in the balance at theend of every eight years, ready to fly up and kick the beam as soon as the opposite scalewas loaded with a falling star.Whatever its origin may have been, the cycle of eight years appears to have coincided withthe normal length of the king’s reign in other parts of Greece besides Sparta. Thus Minos,king of Cnossus in Crete, whose great palace has been unearthed in recent years, is said tohave held office for periods of eight years together. At the end of each period he retired for aseason to the oracular cave on Mount Ida, and there communed with his divine father Zeus,giving him an account of his kingship in the years that were past, and receiving from himinstructions for his guidance in those which were to come. The tradition plainly implies that atthe end of every eight years the king’s sacred powers needed to be renewed by intercoursewith the godhead, and that without such a renewal he would have forfeited his right to thethrone. Without being unduly rash we may surmise that the tribute of seven youths and seven maid-ens whom the Athenians were bound to send to Minos every eight years had some connexionwith the renewal of the king’s power for another octennial cycle. Traditions varied as to thefate which awaited the lads and damsels on their arrival in Crete; but the common viewappears to have been that they were shut up in the labyrinth, there to be devoured by theMinotaur, or at least to be imprisoned for life. Perhaps they were sacrificed by being roastedalive in a bronze image of a bull, or of a bull-headed man, in order to renew the strength ofPage 220"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"the king and of the sun, whom he personated. This at all events is suggested by the legend ofTalos, a bronze man who clutched people to his breast and leaped with them into the fire, sothat they were roasted alive. He is said to have been given by Zeus to Europa, or byHephaestus to Minos, to guard the island of Crete, which he patrolled thrice daily. Accordingto one account he was a bull, according to another he was the sun. Probably he was identicalwith the Minotaur, and stripped of his mythical features was nothing but a bronze image of thesun represented as a man with a bull’s head. In order to renew the solar fires, human victimsmay have been sacrificed to the idol by being roasted in its hollow body or placed on its slop-ing hands and allowed to roll into a pit of fire. It was in the latter fashion that theCarthaginians sacrificed their offspring to Moloch. The children were laid on the hands of acalf-headed image of bronze, from which they slid into a fiery oven, while the people dancedto the music of flutes and timbrels to drown the shrieks of the burning victims. The resem-blance which the Cretan traditions bear to the Carthaginian practice suggests that the worshipassociated with the names of Minos and the Minotaur may have been powerfully influencedby that of a Semitic Baal. In the tradition of Phalaris, tyrant of Agrigentum, and his brazen bullwe may have an echo of similar rites in Sicily, where the Carthaginian power struck deeproots.In the province of Lagos, the Ijebu tribe of the Yoruba race is divided into two branches, whichare known respectively as the Ijebu Ode and the Ijebu Remon. The Ode branch of the tribe isruled by a chief who bears the title of Awujale and is surrounded by a great deal of mystery.Down to recent times his face might not be seen even by his own subjects, and if circum-stances obliged him to communicate with them he did so through a screen which hid himfrom view. The other or Remon branch of the Ijebu tribe is governed by a chief, who ranksbelow the Awujale. Mr. John Parkinson was informed that in former times this subordinatechief used to be killed with ceremony after a rule of three years. As the country is now underBritish protection the custom of putting the chief to death at the end of a three years’ reignhas long been abolished, and Mr. Parkinson was unable to ascertain any particulars on thesubject.At Babylon, within historical times, the tenure of the kingly office was in practice lifelong, yetin theory it would seem to have been merely annual. For every year at the festival of Zagmukthe king had to renew his power by seizing the hands of the image of Marduk in his greattemple of Esagil at Babylon. Even when Babylon passed under the power of Assyria, themonarchs of that country were expected to legalise their claim to the throne every year bycoming to Babylon and performing the ancient ceremony at the New Year festival, and someof them found the obligation so burdensome that rather than discharge it they renounced thetitle of king altogether and contented themselves with the humbler one of Governor. Further, itwould appear that in remote times, though not within the historical period, the kings ofBabylon or their barbarous predecessors forfeited not merely their crown but their life at theend of a year’s tenure of office. At least this is the conclusion to which the following evidenceseems to point. According to the historian Berosus, who as a Babylonian priest spoke withample knowledge, there was annually celebrated in Babylon a festival called the Sacaea. Itbegan on the sixteenth day of the month Lous, and lasted for five days, during which mastersand servants changed places, the servants giving orders and the masters obeying them. Aprisoner condemned to death was dressed in the king’s robes, seated on the king’s throne,allowed to issue whatever commands he pleased, to eat, drink, and enjoy himself, and to liewith the king’s concubines. But at the end of the five days he was stripped of his royal robes,scourged, and hanged or impaled. During his brief term of office he bore the title of Zoganes.This custom might perhaps have been explained as merely a grim jest perpetrated in a sea-Page 221"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"son of jollity at the expense of an unhappy criminal. But one circumstance—the leave given tothe mock king to enjoy the king’s concubines—is decisive against this interpretation.Considering the jealous seclusion of an oriental despot’s harem we may be quite certain thatpermission to invade it would never have been granted by the despot, least of all to a con-demned criminal, except for the very gravest cause. This cause could hardly be other thanthat the condemned man was about to die in the king’s stead, and that to make the substitu-tion perfect it was necessary he should enjoy the full rights of royalty during his brief reign.There is nothing surprising in this substitution. The rule that the king must be put to deatheither on the appearance of any symptom of bodily decay or at the end of a fixed period iscertainly one which, sooner or later, the kings would seek to abolish or modify. We have seenthat in Ethiopia, Sofala, and Eyeo the rule was boldly set aside by enlightened monarchs; andthat in Calicut the old custom of killing the king at the end of twelve years was changed into apermission granted to any one at the end of the twelve years’ period to attack the king, and,in the event of killing him, to reign in his stead; though, as the king took care at these times tobe surrounded by his guards, the permission was little more than a form. Another way ofmodifying the stern old rule is seen in the Babylonian custom just described. When the timedrew near for the king to be put to death (in Babylon this appears to have been at the end ofa single year’s reign) he abdicated for a few days, during which a temporary king reigned andsuffered in his stead. At first the temporary king may have been an innocent person, possiblya member of the king’s own family; but with the growth of civilisation the sacrifice of an inno-cent person would be revolting to the public sentiment, and accordingly a condemned criminalwould be invested with the brief and fatal sovereignty. In the sequel we shall find other exam-ples of a dying criminal representing a dying god. For we must not forget that, as the case ofthe Shilluk kings clearly shows, the king is slain in his character of a god or a demigod, hisdeath and resurrection, as the only means of perpetuating the divine life unimpaired, beingdeemed necessary for the salvation of his people and the world.Avestige of a practice of putting the king to death at the end of a year’s reign appears tohave survived in the festival called Macahity, which used to be celebrated in Hawaii duringthe last month of the year. About a hundred years ago a Russian voyager described the cus-tom as follows: “The taboo Macahity is not unlike to our festival of Christmas. It continues awhole month, during which the people amuse themselves with dances, plays, and sham-fights of every kind. The king must open this festival wherever he is. On this occasion hismajesty dresses himself in his richest cloak and helmet, and is paddled in a canoe along theshore, followed sometimes by many of his subjects. He embarks early, and must finish hisexcursion at sunrise. The strongest and most expert of the warriors is chosen to receive himon his landing. This warrior watches the canoe along the beach; and as soon as the kinglands, and has thrown off his cloak, he darts his spear at him, from a distance of about thirtypaces, and the king must either catch the spear in his hand, or suffer from it: there is no jest-ing in the business. Having caught it, he carries it under his arm, with the sharp end down-wards, into the temple or heavoo. On his entrance, the assembled multitude begin theirsham-fights, and immediately the air is obscured by clouds of spears, made for the occasionwith blunted ends. Hamamea [the king] has been frequently advised to abolish this ridiculousceremony, in which he risks his life every year; but to no effect. His answer always is, that heis as able to catch a spear as any one on the island is to throw it at him. During the Macahity,all punishments are remitted throughout the country; and no person can leave the place inwhich he commences these holidays, let the affair be ever so important.”That a king should regularly have been put to death at the close of a year’s reign will hardlyappear improbable when we learn that to this day there is still a kingdom in which the reignPage 222"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"and the life of the sovereign are limited to a single day. In Ngoio, a province of the ancientkingdom of Congo, the rule obtains that the chief who assumes the cap of sovereignty isalways killed on the night after his coronation. The right of succession lies with the chief ofthe Musurongo; but we need not wonder that he does not exercise it, and that the thronestands vacant. “No one likes to lose his life for a few hours’ glory on the Ngoio throne.”Chapter XXVTemporary KingsIN some places the modified form of the old custom of regicide which appears to have pre-vailed at Babylon has been further softened down. The king still abdicates annually for a shorttime and his place is filled by a more or less nominal sovereign; but at the close of his shortreign the latter is no longer killed, though sometimes a mock execution still survives as amemorial of the time when he was actually put to death. To take examples. In the month ofMéac (February) the king of Cambodia annually abdicated for three days. During this time heperformed no act of authority, he did not touch the seals, he did not even receive the rev-enues which fell due. In his stead there reigned a temporary king called Sdach Méac, that is,King February. The office of temporary king was hereditary in a family distantly connectedwith the royal house, the sons succeeding the fathers and the younger brothers the elderbrothers just as in the succession to the real sovereignty. On a favourable day fixed by theastrologers the temporary king was conducted by the mandarins in triumphal procession. Herode one of the royal elephants, seated in the royal palanquin, and escorted by soldiers who,dressed in appropriate costumes, represented the neighbouring peoples of Siam, Annam,Laos, and so on. In place of the golden crown he wore a peaked white cap, and his regalia,instead of being of gold encrusted with diamonds, were of rough wood. After paying homageto the real king, from whom he received the sovereignty for three days, together with all therevenues accruing during that time (though this last custom has been omitted for some time),he moved in procession round the palace and through the streets of the capital. On the thirdday, after the usual procession, the temporary king gave orders that the elephants shouldtrample under foot the “mountain of rice,” which was a scaffold of bamboo surrounded bysheaves of rice. The people gathered up the rice, each man taking home a little with him tosecure a good harvest. Some of it was also taken to the king, who had it cooked and present-ed to the monks.In Siam on the sixth day of the moon in the sixth month (the end of April) a temporary king isappointed, who for three days enjoys the royal prerogatives, the real king remaining shut upin his palace. This temporary king sends his numerous satellites in all directions to seize andconfiscate whatever they can find in the bazaar and open shops; even the ships and junkswhich arrive in harbour during the three days are forfeited to him and must be redeemed. Hegoes to a field in the middle of the city, whither they bring a gilded plough drawn by gaily-decked oxen. After the plough has been anointed and the oxen rubbed with incense, themock king traces nine furrows with the plough, followed by aged dames of the palace scatter-ing the first seed of the season. As soon as the nine furrows are drawn, the crowd of specta-tors rushes in and scrambles for the seed which has just been sown, believing that, mixedwith the seed-rice, it will ensure a plentiful crop. Then the oxen are unyoked, and rice, maize,sesame, sago, bananas, sugar-cane, melons, and so on, are set before them; whatever theyeat first will, it is thought, be dear in the year following, though some people interpret theomen in the opposite sense. During this time the temporary king stands leaning against a treewith his right foot resting on his left knee. From standing thus on one foot he is popularlyknown as King Hop; but his official title is Phaya Phollathep “Lord of the Heavenly Hosts.” HePage 223"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"is a sort of Minister of Agriculture; all disputes about fields, rice, and so forth, are referred tohim. There is moreover another ceremony in which he personates the king. It takes place inthe second month (which falls in the cold season) and lasts three days. He is conducted inprocession to an open place opposite the Temple of the Brahmans, where there are a numberof poles dressed like May-poles, upon which the Brahmans swing. All the while that theyswing and dance, the Lord of the Heavenly Hosts has to stand on one foot upon a seat whichis made of bricks plastered over, covered with a white cloth, and hung with tapestry. He issupported by a wooden frame with a gilt canopy, and two Brahmans stand one on each sideof him. The dancing Brahmans carry buffalo horns with which they draw water from a largecopper caldron and sprinkle it on the spectators; this is supposed to bring good luck, causingthe people to dwell in peace and quiet, health and prosperity. The time during which the Lordof the Heavenly Hosts has to stand on one foot is about three hours. This is thought “to provethe dispositions of the Devattas and spirits.” If he lets his foot down “he is liable to forfeit hisproperty and have his family enslaved by the king, as it is believed to be a bad omen, por-tending destruction to the state, and instability to the throne. But if he stand firm he isbelieved to have gained a victory over evil spirits, and he has moreover the privilege, ostensi-bly at least, of seizing any ship which may enter the harbour during these three days, andtaking its contents, and also of entering any open shop in the town and carrying away whathe chooses.”Such were the duties and privileges of the Siamese King Hop down to about the middle of thenineteenth century or later. Under the reign of the late enlightened monarch this quaint per-sonage was to some extent both shorn of the glories and relieved of the burden of his office.He still watches, as of old, the Brahmans rushing through the air in a swing suspendedbetween two tall masts, each some ninety feet high; but he is allowed to sit instead of stand,and, although public opinion still expects him to keep his right foot on his left knee during thewhole of the ceremony, he would incur no legal penalty were he, to the great chagrin of thepeople, to put his weary foot to the ground. Other signs, too, tell of the invasion of the East bythe ideas and civilisation of the West. The thoroughfares that lead to the scene of the per-formance are blocked with carriages: lamp-posts and telegraph posts, to which eager specta-tors cling like monkeys, rise above the dense crowd; and, while a tatterdemalion band of theold style, in gaudy garb of vermilion and yellow, bangs and tootles away on drums and trum-pets of an antique pattern, the procession of barefooted soldiers in brilliant uniforms stepsbriskly along to the lively strains of a modern military band playing “Marching throughGeorgia.”On the first day of the sixth month, which was regarded as the beginning of the year, the kingand people of Samarcand used to put on new clothes and cut their hair and beards. Thenthey repaired to a forest near the capital where they shot arrows on horseback for sevendays. On the last day the target was a gold coin, and he who hit it had the right to be king forone day. In Upper Egypt on the first day of the solar year by Coptic reckoning, that is, on thetenth of September, when the Nile has generally reached its highest point, the regular govern-ment is suspended for three days and every town chooses its own ruler. This temporary lordwears a sort of tall fool’s cap and a long flaxen beard, and is enveloped in a strange mantle.With a wand of office in his hand and attended by men disguised as scribes, executioners,and so forth, he proceeds to the Governor’s house. The latter allows himself to be deposed;and the mock king, mounting the throne, holds a tribunal, to the decisions of which even thegovernor and his officials must bow. After three days the mock king is condemned to death;the envelope or shell in which he was encased is committed to the flames, and from its ashesthe Fellah creeps forth. The custom perhaps points to an old practice of burning a real king inPage 224"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"grim earnest. In Uganda the brothers of the king used to be burned, because it was not lawfulto shed the royal blood.The Mohammedan students of Fez, in Morocco, are allowed to appoint a sultan of their own,who reigns for a few weeks, and is known as Sultan t-tulba, “the Sultan of the Scribes.” Thisbrief authority is put up for auction and knocked down to the highest bidder. It brings somesubstantial privileges with it, for the holder is freed from taxes thenceforward, and he has theright of asking a favour from the real sultan. That favour is seldom refused; it usually consistsin the release of a prisoner. Moreover, the agents of the student-sultan levy fines on the shop-keepers and householders, against whom they trump up various humorous charges. The tem-porary sultan is surrounded with the pomp of a real court, and parades the streets in statewith music and shouting, while a royal umbrella is held over his head. With the so-called finesand free-will offerings, to which the real sultan adds a liberal supply of provisions, the stu-dents have enough to furnish forth a magnificent banquet; and altogether they enjoy them-selves thoroughly, indulging in all kinds of games and amusements. For the first seven daysthe mock sultan remains in the college; then he goes about a mile out of the town andencamps on the bank of the river, attended by the students and not a few of the citizens. Onthe seventh day of his stay outside the town he is visited by the real sultan, who grants himhis request and gives him seven more days to reign, so that the reign of “the Sultan of theScribes” nominally lasts three weeks. But when six days of the last week have passed themock sultan runs back to the town by night. This temporary sultanship always falls in spring,about the beginning of April. Its origin is said to have been as follows. When Mulai RasheedII. was fighting for the throne in 1664 or 1665, a certain Jew usurped the royal authority atTaza. But the rebellion was soon suppressed through the loyalty and devotion of the students.To effect their purpose they resorted to an ingenious stratagem. Forty of them caused them-selves to be packed in chests which were sent as a present to the usurper. In the dead ofnight, while the unsuspecting Jew was slumbering peacefully among the packing-cases, thelids were stealthily raised, the brave forty crept forth, slew the usurper, and took possessionof the city in the name of the real sultan, who, to mark his gratitude for the help thus renderedhim in time of need, conferred on the students the right of annually appointing a sultan of theirown. The narrative has all the air of a fiction devised to explain an old custom, of which thereal meaning and origin had been forgotten.Acustom of annually appointing a mock king for a single day was observed at Lostwithiel inCornwall down to the sixteenth century. On “little Easter Sunday” the freeholders of the townand manor assembled together, either in person or by their deputies, and one among them,as it fell to his lot by turn, gaily attired and gallantly mounted, with a crown on his head, asceptre in his hand, and a sword borne before him, rode through the principal street to thechurch, dutifully attended by all the rest on horseback. The clergyman in his best robesreceived him at the churchyard stile and conducted him to hear divine service. On leaving thechurch he repaired, with the same pomp, to a house provided for his reception. Here a feastawaited him and his suite, and being set at the head of the table he was served on bendedknees, with all the rites due to the estate of a prince. The ceremony ended with the dinner,and every man returned home.Sometimes the temporary king occupies the throne, not annually, but once for all at the begin-ning of each reign. Thus in the kingdom of Jambi in Sumatra it is the custom that at thebeginning of a new reign a man of the people should occupy the throne and exercise theroyal prerogatives for a single day. The origin of the custom is explained by a tradition thatthere were once five royal brothers, the four elder of whom all declined the throne on thePage 225"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"ground of various bodily defects, leaving it to their youngest brother. But the eldest occupiedthe throne for one day, and reserved for his descendants a similar privilege at the beginningof every reign. Thus the office of temporary king is hereditary in a family akin to the royalhouse. In Bilaspur it seems to be the custom, after the death of a Rajah, for a Brahman to eatrice out of the dead Rajah’s hand, and then to occupy the throne for a year. At the end of theyear the Brahman receives presents and is dismissed from the territory, being forbiddenapparently to return. “The idea seems to be that the spirit of the Rájá enters into the Bráhmanwho eats the khir (rice and milk) out of his hand when he is dead, as the Brahman is appar-ently carefully watched during the whole year, and not allowed to go away.” The same or asimilar custom is believed to obtain among the hill states about Kangra. The custom of ban-ishing the Brahman who represents the king may be a substitute for putting him to death. Atthe installation of a prince of Carinthia a peasant, in whose family the office was hereditary,ascended a marble stone which stood surrounded by meadows in a spacious valley; on hisright stood a black mother-cow, on his left a lean ugly mare. A rustic crowd gathered abouthim. Then the future prince, dressed as a peasant and carrying a shepherd’s staff, drew near,attended by courtiers and magistrates. On perceiving him the peasant called out, “Who is thiswhom I see coming so proudly along?” The people answered, “The prince of the land.” Thepeasant was then prevailed on to surrender the marble seat to the prince on condition ofreceiving sixty pence, the cow and mare, and exemption from taxes. But before yielding hisplace he gave the prince a light blow on the cheek.Some points about these temporary kings deserve to be specially noticed before we pass tothe next branch of the evidence. In the first place, the Cambodian and Siamese examplesshow clearly that it is especially the divine or magical functions of the king which are trans-ferred to his temporary substitute. This appears from the belief that by keeping up his foot thetemporary king of Siam gained a victory over the evil spirits, whereas by letting it down heimperilled the existence of the state. Again, the Cambodian ceremony of trampling down the“mountain of rice,” and the Siamese ceremony of opening the ploughing and sowing, arecharms to produce a plentiful harvest, as appears from the belief that those who carry homesome of the trampled rice, or of the seed sown, will thereby secure a good crop. Moreover,when the Siamese representative of the king is guiding the plough, the people watch him anx-iously, not to see whether he drives a straight furrow, but to mark the exact point on his leg towhich the skirt of his silken robe reaches; for on that is supposed to hang the state of theweather and the crops during the ensuing season. If the Lord of the Heavenly Hosts hitchesup his garment above his knee, the weather will be wet and heavy rains will spoil the harvest.If he lets it trail to his ankle, a drought will be the consequence. But fine weather and heavycrops will follow if the hem of his robe hangs exactly half-way down the calf of his leg. Soclosely is the course of nature, and with it the weal or woe of the people, dependent on theminutest act or gesture of the king’s representative. But the task of making the crops grow,thus deputed to the temporary kings, is one of the magical functions regularly supposed to bedischarged by kings in primitive society. The rule that the mock king must stand on one footupon a raised seat in the rice-field was perhaps originally meant as a charm to make the cropgrow high; at least this was the object of a similar ceremony observed by the old Prussians.The tallest girl, standing on one foot upon a seat, with her lap full of cakes, a cup of brandy inher right hand and a piece of elm-bark or linden-bark in her left, prayed to the godWaizganthos that the flax might grow as high as she was standing. Then, after draining thecup, she had it refilled, and poured the brandy on the ground as an offering to Waizganthos,and threw down the cakes for his attendant sprites. If she remained steady on one footthroughout the ceremony, it was an omen that the flax crop would be good; but if she let herfoot down, it was feared that the crop might fail. The same significance perhaps attaches toPage 226"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"the swinging of the Brahmans, which the Lord of the Heavenly Hosts had formerly to witnessstanding on one foot. On the principles of homoeopathic or imitative magic it might be thoughtthat the higher the priests swing the higher will grow the rice. For the ceremony is describedas a harvest festival, and swinging is practised by the Letts of Russia with the avowed inten-tion of influencing the growth of the crops. In the spring and early summer, between Easterand St. John’s Day (the summer solstice), every Lettish peasant is said to devote his leisurehours to swinging diligently; for the higher he rises in the air the higher will his flax grow thatseason.In the foregoing cases the temporary king is appointed annually in accordance with a regularcustom. But in other cases the appointment is made only to meet a special emergency, suchas to relieve the real king from some actual or threatened evil by diverting it to a substitute,who takes his place on the throne for a short time. The history of Persia furnishes instancesof such occasional substitutes for the Shah. Thus Shah Abbas the Great, being warned by hisastrologers in the year 1591 that a serious danger impended over him, attempted to avert theomen by abdicating the throne and appointing a certain unbeliever named Yusoofee, probablya Christian, to reign in his stead. The substitute was accordingly crowned, and for three days,if we may trust the Persian historians, he enjoyed not only the name and the state but thepower of the king. At the end of his brief reign he was put to death: the decree of the starswas fulfilled by this sacrifice; and Abbas, who reascended his throne in a most propitioushour, was promised by his astrologers a long and glorious reign.Chapter XXVISacrifice of the King’s SonAPOINT to notice about the temporary kings described in the foregoing chapter is that in twoplaces (Cambodia and Jambi) they come of a stock which is believed to be akin to the royalfamily. If the view here taken of the origin of these temporary kingships is correct, we caneasily understand why the king’s substitute should sometimes be of the same race as theking. When the king first succeeded in getting the life of another accepted as a sacrificeinstead of his own, he would have to show that the death of that other would serve the pur-pose quite as well as his own would have done. Now it was as a god or demigod that theking had to die; therefore the substitute who died for him had to be invested, at least for theoccasion, with the divine attributes of the king. This, as we have just seen, was certainly thecase with the temporary kings of Siam and Cambodia; they were invested with the supernatu-ral functions, which in an earlier stage of society were the special attributes of the king. Butno one could so well represent the king in his divine character as his son, who might be sup-posed to share the divine afflatus of his father. No one, therefore, could so appropriately diefor the king and, through him, for the whole people, as the king’s son. We have seen that according to tradition, Aun or On, King of Sweden, sacrificed nine of hissons to Odin at Upsala in order that his own life might be spared. After he had sacrificed hissecond son he received from the god an answer that he should live so long as he gave himone of his sons every ninth year. When he had sacrificed his seventh son, he still lived, butwas so feeble that he could not walk but had to be carried in a chair. Then he offered up hiseighth son, and lived nine years more, lying in his bed. After that he sacrificed his ninth son,and lived another nine years, but so that he drank out of a horn like a weaned child. He nowwished to sacrifice his only remaining son to Odin, but the Swedes would not allow him. Sohe died and was buried in a mound at Upsala.Page 227"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"In ancient Greece there seems to have been at least one kingly house of great antiquity ofwhich the eldest sons were always liable to be sacrificed in room of their royal sires. WhenXerxes was marching through Thessaly at the head of his mighty host to attack the Spartansat Thermopylae, he came to the town of Alus. Here he was shown the sanctuary ofLaphystian Zeus, about which his guides told him a strange tale. It ran somewhat as follows.Once upon a time the king of the country, by name Athamas, married a wife Nephele, andhad by her a son called Phrixus and a daughter named Helle. Afterwards he took to himself asecond wife called Ino, by whom he had two sons, Learchus and Melicertes. But his secondwife was jealous of her stepchildren, Phrixus and Helle, and plotted their death. She wentabout very cunningly to compass her bad end. First of all she persuaded the women of thecountry to roast the seed corn secretly before it was committed to the ground. So next yearno crops came up and the people died of famine. Then the king sent messengers to the ora-cle at Delphi to enquire the cause of the dearth. But the wicked stepmother bribed the mes-senger to give out as the answer of the god that the dearth would never cease till the childrenof Athamas by his first wife had been sacrificed to Zeus. When Athamas heard that, he sentfor the children, who were with the sheep. But a ram with a fleece of gold opened his lips,and speaking with the voice of a man warned the children of their danger. So they mountedthe ram and fled with him over land and sea. As they flew over the sea, the girl slipped fromthe animal’s back, and falling into water was drowned. But her brother Phrixus was broughtsafe to the land of Colchis, where reigned a child of the sun. Phrixus married the king’sdaughter, and she bore him a son Cytisorus. And there he sacrificed the ram with the goldenfleece to Zeus the God of Flight; but some will have it that he sacrificed the animal toLaphystian Zeus. The golden fleece itself he gave to his wife’s father, who nailed it to an oaktree, guarded by a sleepless dragon in a sacred grove of Ares. Meanwhile at home an oraclehad commanded that King Athamas himself should be sacrificed as an expiatory offering forthe whole country. So the people decked him with garlands like a victim and led him to thealtar, where they were just about to sacrifice him when he was rescued either by his grand-son Cytisorus, who arrived in the nick of time from Colchis, or by Hercules, who brought tid-ings that the king’s son Phrixus was yet alive. Thus Athamas was saved, but afterward hewent mad, and mistaking his son Learchus for a wild beast, shot him dead. Next he attempt-ed the life of his remaining son Melicertes, but the child was rescued by his mother Ino, whoran and threw herself and him from a high rock into the sea. Mother and son were changedinto marine divinities, and the son received special homage in the isle of Tenedos, wherebabes were sacrificed to him. Thus bereft of wife and children the unhappy Athamas quittedhis country, and on enquiring of the oracle where he should dwell was told to take up hisabode wherever he should be entertained by wild beasts. He fell in with a pack of wolvesdevouring sheep, and when they saw him they fled and left him the bleeding remnants oftheir prey. In this way the oracle was fulfilled. But because King Athamas had not been sacri-ficed as a sin-offering for the whole country, it was divinely decreed that the eldest male scionof his family in each generation should be sacrificed without fail, if ever he set foot in thetown-hall, where the offerings were made to Laphystian Zeus by one of the house ofAthamas. Many of the family, Xerxes was informed, had fled to foreign lands to escape thisdoom; but some of them had returned long afterwards, and being caught by the sentinels inthe act of entering the town-hall were wreathed as victims, led forth in procession, and sacri-ficed. These instances appear to have been notorious, if not frequent; for the writer of a dia-logue attributed to Plato, after speaking of the immolation of human victims by theCarthaginians, adds that such practices were not unknown among the Greeks, and he referswith horror to the sacrifices offered on Mount Lycaeus and by the descendants of Athamas.The suspicion that this barbarous custom by no means fell into disuse even in later days isPage 228"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"strengthened by a case of human sacrifice which occurred in Plutarch’s time at Orchomenus,a very ancient city of Boeotia, distant only a few miles across the plain from the historian’sbirthplace. Here dwelt a family of which the men went by the name of Psoloeis or “Sooty,”and the women by the name of Oleae or “Destructive.” Every year at the festival of theAgrionia the priest of Dionysus pursued these women with a drawn sword, and if he overtookone of them he had the right to slay her. In Plutarch’s lifetime the right was actually exercisedby a priest Zoilus. The family thus liable to furnish at least one human victim every year wasof royal descent, for they traced their lineage to Minyas, the famous old king of Orchomenus,the monarch of fabulous wealth, whose stately treasury, as it is called, still stands in ruins atthe point where the long rocky hill of Orchomenus melts into the vast level expanse of theCopaic plain. Tradition ran that the king’s three daughters long despised the other women ofthe country for yielding to the Bacchic frenzy, and sat at home in the king’s house scornfullyplying the distaff and the loom, while the rest, wreathed with flowers, their dishevelled locksstreaming to the wind, roamed in ecstasy the barren mountains that rise above Orchomenus,making the solitude of the hills to echo to the wild music of cymbals and tambourines. But intime the divine fury infected even the royal damsels in their quiet chamber; they were seizedwith a fierce longing to partake of human flesh, and cast lots among themselves which shouldgive up her child to furnish a cannibal feast. The lot fell on Leucippe, and she surrendered herson Hippasus, who was torn limb from limb by the three. From these misguided womensprang the Oleae and the Psoloeis, of whom the men were said to be so called because theywore sad-coloured raiment in token of their mourning and grief.Now this practice of taking human victims from a family of royal descent at Orchomenus is allthe more significant because Athamas himself is said to have reigned in the land ofOrchomenus even before the time of Minyas, and because over against the city there risesMount Laphystius, on which, as at Alus in Thessaly, there was a sanctuary of LaphystianZeus, where, according to tradition, Athamas purposed to sacrifice his two children Phrixusand Helle. On the whole, comparing the traditions about Athamas with the custom thatobtained with regard to his descendants in historical times, we may fairly infer that inThessaly and probably in Boeotia there reigned of old a dynasty of which the kings wereliable to be sacrificed for the good of the country to the god called Laphystian Zeus, but thatthey contrived to shift the fatal responsibility to their offspring, of whom the eldest son wasregularly destined to the altar. As time went on, the cruel custom was so far mitigated that aram was accepted as a vicarious sacrifice in room of the royal victim, provided always thatthe prince abstained from setting foot in the town-hall where the sacrifices were offered toLaphystian Zeus by one of his kinsmen. But if he were rash enough to enter the place ofdoom, to thrust himself wilfully, as it were, on the notice of the god who had good-naturedlywinked at the substitution of a ram, the ancient obligation which had been suffered to lie inabeyance recovered all its force, and there was no help for it but he must die. The traditionwhich associated the sacrifice of the king or his children with a great dearth points clearly tothe belief, so common among primitive folk, that the king is responsible for the weather andthe crops, and that he may justly pay with his life for the inclemency of the one or the failureof the other. Athamas and his line, in short, appear to have united divine or magical with royalfunctions; and this view is strongly supported by the claims to divinity which Salmoneus, thebrother of Athamas, is said to have set up. We have seen that this presumptuous mortal pro-fessed to be no other than Zeus himself, and to wield the thunder and lightning, of which hemade a trumpery imitation by the help of tinkling kettles and blazing torches. If we may judgefrom analogy, his mock thunder and lightning were no mere scenic exhibition designed todeceive and impress the beholders; they were enchantments practised by the royal magicianfor the purpose of bringing about the celestial phenomena which they feebly mimicked.Page 229"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Among the Semites of Western Asia the king, in a time of national danger, sometimes gavehis own son to die as a sacrifice for the people. Thus Philo of Byblus, in his work on theJews, says: “It was an ancient custom in a crisis of great danger that the ruler of a city ornation should give his beloved son to die for the whole people, as a ransom offered to theavenging demons; and the children thus offered were slain with mystic rites. So Cronus,whom the Phoenicians call Israel, being king of the land and having an only-begotten soncalled Jeoud (for in the Phoenician tongue Jeoud signifies ‘only begotten’), dressed him inroyal robes and sacrificed him upon an altar in a time of war, when the country was in greatdanger from the enemy.” When the king of Moab was besieged by the Israelites and hardbeset, he took his eldest son, who should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for aburnt offering on the wall.Chapter XXVIISuccession to the SoulTO the view that in early times, and among barbarous races, kings have frequently been putto death at the end of a short reign, it may be objected that such a custom would tend to theextinction of the royal family. The objection may be met by observing, first, that the kingship isoften not confined to one family, but may be shared in turn by several; second, that the officeis frequently not hereditary, but is open to men of any family, even to foreigners, who may ful-fil the requisite conditions, such as marrying a princess or vanquishing the king in battle; and,third, that even if the custom did tend to the extinction of a dynasty, that is not a considerationwhich would prevent its observance among people less provident of the future and less heed-ful of human life than ourselves. Many races, like many individuals, have indulged in practiceswhich must in the end destroy them. The Polynesians seem regularly to have killed two-thirdsof their children. In some parts of East Africa the proportion of infants massacred at birth issaid to be the same. Only children born in certain presentations are allowed to live. TheJagas, a conquering tribe in Angola, are reported to have put to death all their children, with-out exception, in order that the women might not be cumbered with babies on the march.They recruited their numbers by adopting boys and girls of thirteen or fourteen years of age,whose parents they had killed and eaten. Among the Mbaya Indians of South America thewomen used to murder all their children except the last, or the one they believed to be thelast. If one of them had another child afterwards, she killed it. We need not wonder that thispractice entirely destroyed a branch of the Mbaya nation, who had been for many years themost formidable enemies of the Spaniards. Among the Lengua Indians of the Gran Chaco,the missionaries discovered what they describe as “a carefully planned system of racial sui-cide, by the practice of infanticide by abortion, and other methods.” Nor is infanticide the onlymode in which a savage tribe commits suicide. A lavish use of the poison ordeal may beequally effective. Some time ago a small tribe named Uwet came down from the hill country,and settled on the left branch of the Calabar River in West Africa. When the missionaries firstvisited the place, they found the population considerable, distributed into three villages. Sincethen the constant use of the poison ordeal has almost extinguished the tribe. On one occa-sion the whole population took poison to prove their innocence. About half perished on thespot, and the remnant, we are told, still continuing their superstitious practice, must soonbecome extinct. With such examples before us we need not hesitate to believe that manytribes have felt no scruple or delicacy in observing a custom which tends to wipe out a singlefamily. To attribute such scruples to them is to commit the common, the perpetually repeatedmistake of judging the savage by the standard of European civilisation. If any of my readersset out with the notion that all races of men think and act much in the same way as educatedPage 230"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Englishmen, the evidence of superstitious belief and custom collected in this work should suf-fice to disabuse him of so erroneous a prepossession.The explanation here given of the custom of killing divine persons assumes, or at least isreadily combined with, the idea that the soul of the slain divinity is transmitted to his succes-sor. Of this transmission I have no direct proof except in the case of the Shilluk, among whomthe practice of killing the divine king prevails in a typical form, and with whom it is a funda-mental article of faith that the soul of the divine founder of the dynasty is immanent in everyone of his slain successors. But if this is the only actual example of such a belief which I canadduce, analogy seems to render it probable that a similar succession to the soul of the slaingod has been supposed to take place in other instances, though direct evidence of it is want-ing. For it has been already shown that the soul of the incarnate deity is often supposed totransmigrate at death into another incarnation; and if this takes place when the death is a nat-ural one, there seems no reason why it should not take place when the death has beenbrought about by violence. Certainly the idea that the soul of a dying person may be transmit-ted to his successor is perfectly familiar to primitive peoples. In Nias the eldest son usuallysucceeds his father in the chieftainship. But if from any bodily or mental defect the eldest sonis disqualified for ruling, the father determines in his lifetime which of his sons shall succeedhim. In order, however, to establish his right of succession, it is necessary that the son uponwhom his father’s choice falls shall catch in his mouth or in a bag the last breath, and with itthe soul, of the dying chief. For whoever catches his last breath is chief equally with theappointed successor. Hence the other brothers, and sometimes also strangers, crowd roundthe dying man to catch his soul as it passes. The houses in Nias are raised above the groundon posts, and it has happened that when the dying man lay with his face on the floor, one ofthe candidates has bored a hole in the floor and sucked in the chief’s last breath through abamboo tube. When the chief has no son, his soul is caught in a bag, which is fastened to animage made to represent the deceased; the soul is then believed to pass into the image.Sometimes it would appear that the spiritual link between a king and the souls of his prede-cessors is formed by the possession of some part of their persons. In southern Celebes theregalia often consist of corporeal portions of deceased rajahs, which are treasured as sacredrelics and confer the right to the throne. Similarly among the Sakalavas of southernMadagascar a vertebra of the neck, a nail, and a lock of hair of a deceased king are placed ina crocodile’s tooth and carefully kept along with the similar relics of his predecessors in ahouse set apart for the purpose. The possession of these relics constitutes the right to thethrone. A legitimate heir who should be deprived of them would lose all his authority over thepeople, and on the contrary a usurper who should make himself master of the relics would beacknowledged king without dispute. When the Alake or king of Abeokuta in West Africa dies,the principal men decapitate his body, and placing the head in a large earthen vessel deliverit to the new sovereign; it becomes his fetish and he is bound to pay it honours. Sometimes,in order apparently that the new sovereign may inherit more surely the magical and othervirtues of the royal line, he is required to eat a piece of his dead predecessor. Thus atAbeokuta not only was the head of the late king presented to his successor, but the tonguewas cut out and given him to eat. Hence, when the natives wish to signify that the sovereignreigns, they say, “He has eaten the king.” A custom of the same sort is still practised atIbadan, a large town in the interior of Lagos, West Africa. When the king dies his head is cutoff and sent to his nominal suzerain, the Alafin of Oyo, the paramount king of Yoruba land; buthis heart is eaten by his successor. This ceremony was performed not very many years agoat the accession of a new king of Ibadan.Page 231"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Taking the whole of the preceding evidence into account, we may fairly suppose that whenthe divine king or priest is put to death his spirit is believed to pass into his successor. In pointof fact, among the Shilluk of the White Nile, who regularly kill their divine kings, every king onhis accession has to perform a ceremony which appears designed to convey to him the samesacred and worshipful spirit which animated all his predecessors, one after the other, on thethrone.Chapter XXVIIIThe Killing of the Tree-Spirit1. THE WHITSUNTIDE MUMMERSIT remains to ask what light the custom of killing the divine king or priest sheds upon the spe-cial subject to our enquiry. In an earlier part of this work we saw reason to suppose that theKing of the Wood at Nemi was regarded as an incarnation of a tree-spirit or of the spirit ofvegetation, and that as such he would be endowed, in the belief of his worshippers, with amagical power of making the trees to bear fruit, the crops to grow, and so on. His life musttherefore have been held very precious by his worshippers, and was probably hedged in by asystem of elaborate precautions or taboos like those by which, in so many places, the life ofthe man-god has been guarded against the malignant influence of demons and sorcerers. Butwe have seen that the very value attached to the life of the man-god necessitates his violentdeath as the only means of preserving it from the inevitable decay of age. The same reason-ing would apply to the King of the Wood; he, too, had to be killed in order that the divine spir-it, incarnate in him, might be transferred in its integrity to his successor. The rule that he heldoffice till a stronger should slay him might be supposed to secure both the preservation of hisdivine life in full vigour and its transference to a suitable successor as soon as that vigourbegan to be impaired. For so long as he could maintain his position by the strong hand, itmight be inferred that his natural force was not abated; whereas his defeat and death at thehands of another proved that his strength was beginning to fail and that it was time his divinelife should be lodged in a less dilapidated tabernacle. This explanation of the rule that theKing of the Wood had to be slain by his successor at least renders that rule perfectly intelligi-ble. It is strongly supported by the theory and practice of the Shilluk, who put their divine kingto death at the first signs of failing health, lest his decrepitude should entail a correspondingfailure of vital energy on the corn, the cattle, and men. Moreover, it is countenanced by theanalogy of the Chitomé, upon whose life the existence of the world was supposed to hang,and who was therefore slain by his successor as soon as he showed signs of breaking up.Again, the terms on which in later times the King of Calicut held office are identical with thoseattached to the office of King of the Wood, except that whereas the former might be assailedby a candidate at any time, the King of Calicut might only be attacked once every twelveyears. But as the leave granted to the King of Calicut to reign so long as he could defendhimself against all comers was a mitigation of the old rule which set a fixed term to his life, sowe may conjecture that the similar permission granted to the King of the Wood was a mitiga-tion of an older custom of putting him to death at the end of a definite period. In both casesthe new rule gave to the god-man at least a chance for his life, which under the old rule wasdenied him; and people probably reconciled themselves to the change by reflecting that solong as the god-man could maintain himself by the sword against all assaults, there was noreason to apprehend that the fatal decay had set in.The conjecture that the King of the Wood was formerly put to death at the expiry of a fixedterm, without being allowed a chance for his life, will be confirmed if evidence can bePage 232"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"adduced of a custom of periodically killing his counterparts, the human representatives of thetree-spirit, in Northern Europe. Now in point of fact such a custom has left unmistakabletraces of itself in the rural festivals of the peasantry. To take examples.At Niederpöring, in Lower Bavaria, the Whitsuntide representative of the tree-spirit—thePfingstl as he was called—was clad from top to toe in leaves and flowers. On his head hewore a high pointed cap, the ends of which rested on his shoulders, only two holes being leftin it for his eyes. The cap was covered with water-flowers and surmounted with a nosegay ofpeonies. The sleeves of his coat were also made of water-plants, and the rest of his bodywas enveloped in alder and hazel leaves. On each side of him marched a boy holding up oneof the Pfingstl’s arms. These two boys carried drawn swords, and so did most of the otherswho formed the procession. They stopped at every house where they hoped to receive apresent; and the people, in hiding, soused the leaf-clad boy with water. All rejoiced when hewas well drenched. Finally he waded into the brook up to his middle; whereupon one of theboys, standing on the bridge, pretended to cut off his head. At Wurmlingen, in Swabia, ascore of young fellows dress themselves on Whit-Monday in white shirts and white trousers,with red scarves round their waists and swords hanging from the scarves. They ride onhorseback into the wood, led by two trumpeters blowing their trumpets. In the wood they cutdown leafy oak branches, in which they envelop from head to foot him who was the last oftheir number to ride out of the village. His legs, however, are encased separately, so that hemay be able to mount his horse again. Further, they give him a long artificial neck, with anartificial head and a false face on the top of it. Then a May-tree is cut, generally an aspen orbeech about ten feet high; and being decked with coloured handkerchiefs and ribbons it isentrusted to a special “May-bearer.” The cavalcade then returns with music and song to thevillage. Amongst the personages who figure in the procession are a Moorish king with a sootyface and a crown on his head, a Dr. Iron-Beard, a corporal, and an executioner. They halt onthe village green, and each of the characters makes a speech in rhyme. The executionerannounces that the leaf-clad man has been condemned to death, and cuts off his false head.Then the riders race to the May-tree, which has been set up a little way off. The first man whosucceeds in wrenching it from the ground as he gallops past keeps it with all its decorations.The ceremony is observed every second or third year.In Saxony and Thüringen there is a Whitsuntide ceremony called “chasing the Wild Man outof the bush,” or “fetching the Wild Man out of the wood.” A young fellow is enveloped inleaves or moss and called the Wild Man. He hides in the wood and the other lads of the vil-lage go out to seek him. They find him, lead him captive out of the wood, and fire at him withblank muskets. He falls like dead to the ground, but a lad dressed as a doctor bleeds him,and he comes to life again. At this they rejoice, and, binding him fast on a waggon, take himto the village, where they tell all the people how they have caught the Wild Man. At everyhouse they receive a gift. In the Erzgebirge the following custom was annually observed atShrovetide about the beginning of the seventeenth century. Two men disguised as Wild Men,the one in brushwood and moss, the other in straw, were led about the streets, and at lasttaken to the market-place, where they were chased up and down, shot and stabbed. Beforefalling they reeled about with strange gestures and spirted blood on the people from bladderswhich they carried. When they were down, the huntsmen placed them on boards and carriedthem to the ale-house, the miners marching beside them and winding blasts on their miningtools as if they had taken a noble head of game. A very similar Shrovetide custom is stillobserved near Schluckenau in Bohemia. A man dressed up as a Wild Man is chased throughseveral streets till he comes to a narrow lane across which a cord is stretched. He stumblesover the cord and, falling to the ground, is overtaken and caught by his pursuers. The execu-Page 233"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"tioner runs up and stabs with his sword a bladder filled with blood which the Wild Man wearsround his body; so the Wild Man dies, while a stream of blood reddens the ground. Next daya straw-man, made up to look like the Wild Man, is placed on a litter, and, accompanied by agreat crowd, is taken to a pool into which it is thrown by the executioner. The ceremony iscalled “burying the Carnival.”In Semic (Bohemia) the custom of beheading the King is observed on Whit-Monday. A troopof young people disguise themselves; each is girt with a girdle of bark and carries a woodensword and a trumpet of willow-bark. The King wears a robe of tree-bark adorned with flowers,on his head is a crown of bark decked with flowers and branches, his feet are wound aboutwith ferns, a mask hides his face, and for a sceptre he has a hawthorn switch in his hand. Alad leads him through the village by a rope fastened to his foot, while the rest dance about,blow their trumpets, and whistle. In every farmhouse the King is chased round the room, andone of the troop, amid much noise and outcry, strikes with his sword a blow on the King’srobe of bark till it rings again. Then a gratuity is demanded. The ceremony of decapitation,which is here somewhat slurred over, is carried out with a greater semblance of reality inother parts of Bohemia. Thus in some villages of the Königgrätz district on Whit-Monday thegirls assemble under one lime-tree and the young men under another, all dressed in theirbest and tricked out with ribbons. The young men twine a garland for the Queen, and the girlsanother for the King. When they have chosen the King and Queen they all go in processiontwo and two, to the ale-house, from the balcony of which the crier proclaims the names of theKing and Queen. Both are then invested with the insignia of their office and are crowned withthe garlands, while the music plays up. Then some one gets on a bench and accuses theKing of various offences, such as ill-treating the cattle. The King appeals to witnesses and atrial ensues, at the close of which the judge, who carries a white wand as his badge of office,pronounces a verdict of “Guilty,” or “Not guilty.” If the verdict is “Guilty,” the judge breaks hiswand, the King kneels on a white cloth, all heads are bared, and a soldier sets three or fourhats, one above the other, on his Majesty’s head. The judge then pronounces the word“Guilty” thrice in a loud voice, and orders the crier to behead the King. The crier obeys bystriking off the King’s hats with the wooden sword.But perhaps, for our purpose, the most instructive of these mimic executions is the followingBohemian one. In some places of the Pilsen district (Bohemia) on Whit-Monday the King isdressed in bark, ornamented with flowers and ribbons; he wears a crown of gilt paper andrides a horse, which is also decked with flowers. Attended by a judge, an executioner, andother characters, and followed by a train of soldiers, all mounted, he rides to the villagesquare, where a hut or arbour of green boughs has been erected under the May-trees, whichare firs, freshly cut, peeled to the top, and dressed with flowers and ribbons. After the damesand maidens of the village have been criticised and a frog beheaded, the cavalcade rides to aplace previously determined upon, in a straight, broad street. Here they draw up in two linesand the King takes to flight. He is given a short start and rides off at full speed, pursued bythe whole troop. If they fail to catch him he remains King for another year, and his compan-ions must pay his score at the ale-house in the evening. But if they overtake and catch himhe is scourged with hazel rods or beaten with the wooden swords and compelled to dismount.Then the executioner asks, “Shall I behead this King?” The answer is given, “Behead him”;the executioner brandishes his axe, and with the words, “One, two, three, let the King head-less be!” he strikes off the King’s crown. Amid the loud cries of the bystanders the King sinksto the ground; then he is laid on a bier and carried to the nearest farmhouse.In most of the personages who are thus slain in mimicry it is impossible not to recognise rep-Page 234"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"resentatives of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation, as he is supposed to manifest himself inspring. The bark, leaves, and flowers in which the actors are dressed, and the season of theyear at which they appear, show that they belong to the same class as the Grass King, Kingof the May, Jack-in-the-Green, and other representatives of the vernal spirit of vegetationwhich we examined in an earlier part of this work. As if to remove any possible doubt on thishead, we find that in two cases these slain men are brought into direct connexion with May-trees, which are the impersonal, as the May King, Grass King, and so forth, are the personalrepresentatives of the tree-spirit. The drenching of the Pfingstl with water and his wading upto the middle into the brook are, therefore, no doubt rain-charms like those which have beenalready described.But if these personages represent, as they certainly do, the spirit of vegetation in spring, thequestion arises, Why kill them? What is the object of slaying the spirit of vegetation at anytime and above all in spring, when his services are most wanted? The only probable answerto this question seems to be given in the explanation already proposed of the custom ofkilling the divine king or priest. The divine life, incarnate in a material and mortal body, isliable to be tainted and corrupted by the weakness of the frail medium in which it is for a timeenshrined; and if it is to be saved from the increasing enfeeblement which it must necessarilyshare with its human incarnation as he advances in years, it must be detached from himbefore, or at least as soon as, he exhibits signs of decay, in order to be transferred to a vigor-ous successor. This is done by killing the old representative of the god and conveying thedivine spirit from him to a new incarnation. The killing of the god, that is, of his human incar-nation, is therefore merely a necessary step to his revival or resurrection in a better form. Farfrom being an extinction of the divine spirit, it is only the beginning of a purer and strongermanifestation of it. If this explanation holds good of the custom of killing divine kings andpriests in general, it is still more obviously applicable to the custom of annually killing the rep-resentative of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation in spring. For the decay of plant life in win-ter is readily interpreted by primitive man as an enfeeblement of the spirit of vegetation; thespirit has, he thinks, grown old and weak and must therefore be renovated by being slain andbrought to life in a younger and fresher form. Thus the killing of the representative of the tree-spirit in spring is regarded as a means to promote and quicken the growth of vegetation. Forthe killing of the tree-spirit is associated always (we must suppose) implicitly, and sometimesexplicitly also, with a revival or resurrection of him in a more youthful and vigorous form. So inthe Saxon and Thüringen custom, after the Wild Man has been shot he is brought to lifeagain by a doctor; and in the Wurmlingen ceremony there figures a Dr. Iron-Beard, who prob-ably once played a similar part; certainly in another spring ceremony, which will be describedpresently, Dr. Iron-Beard pretends to restore a dead man to life. But of this revival or resurrec-tion of the god we shall have more to say anon.The points of similarity between these North European personages and the subject of ourenquiry—the King of the Wood or priest of Nemi—are sufficiently striking. In these northernmaskers we see kings, whose dress of bark and leaves along with the hut of green boughsand the fir-trees, under which they hold their court, proclaim them unmistakably as, like theirItalian counterpart, Kings of the Wood. Like him they die a violent death, but like him theymay escape from it for a time by their bodily strength and agility; for in several of these north-ern customs the flight and pursuit of the king is a prominent part of the ceremony, and in onecase at least if the king can outrun his pursuers he retains his life and his office for anotheryear. In this last case the king in fact holds office on condition of running for his life once ayear, just as the King of Calicut in later times held office on condition of defending his lifeagainst all comers once every twelve years, and just as the priest of Nemi held office on con-Page 235"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"dition of defending himself against any assault at any time. In every one of these instancesthe life of the god-man is prolonged on condition of his showing, in a severe physical contestof fight or flight, that his bodily strength is not decayed, and that, therefore, the violent death,which sooner or later is inevitable, may for the present be postponed. With regard to flight it isnoticeable that flight figured conspicuously both in the legend and in the practice of the Kingof the Wood. He had to be a runaway slave in memory of the flight of Orestes, the traditionalfounder of the worship; hence the Kings of the Wood are described by an ancient writer as“both strong of hand and fleet of foot.” Perhaps if we knew the ritual of the Arician grove fullywe might find that the king was allowed a chance for his life by flight, like his Bohemian broth-er. I have already conjectured that the annual flight of the priestly king at Rome (regifugium)was at first a flight of the same kind; in other words, that he was originally one of those divinekings who are either put to death after a fixed period or allowed to prove by the strong handor the fleet foot that their divinity is vigorous and unimpaired. One more point of resemblancemay be noted between the Italian King of the Wood and his northern counterparts. In Saxonyand Thüringen the representative of the tree-spirit, after being killed, is brought to life againby a doctor. This is exactly what legend affirmed to have happened to the first King of theWood at Nemi, Hippolytus or Virbius, who after he had been killed by his horses was restoredto life by the physician Aesculapius. Such a legend tallies well with the theory that the slayingof the King of the Wood was only a step to his revival or resurrection in his successor.2. BURYING THE CARNIVALThus far I have offered an explanation of the rule which required that the priest of Nemishould be slain by his successor. The explanation claims to be no more than probable; ourscanty knowledge of the custom and of its history forbids it to be more. But its probability willbe augmented in proportion to the extent to which the motives and modes of thought which itassumes can be proved to have operated in primitive society. Hitherto the god with whosedeath and resurrection we have been chiefly concerned has been the tree-god. But if I canshow that the custom of killing the god and the belief in his resurrection originated, or at leastexisted, in the hunting and pastoral stage of society, when the slain god was an animal, andthat it survived into the agricultural stage, when the slain god was the corn or a human beingrepresenting the corn, the probability of my explanation will have been considerablyincreased. This I shall attempt to do in the sequel, and in the course of the discussion I hopeto clear up some obscurities which still remain, and to answer some objections which mayhave suggested themselves to the reader.We start from the point at which we left off—the spring customs of European peasantry.Besides the ceremonies already described there are two kindred sets of observances inwhich the simulated death of a divine or supernatural being is a conspicuous feature. In oneof them the being whose death is dramatically represented is a personification of theCarnival; in the other it is Death himself. The former ceremony falls naturally at the end of theCarnival, either on the last day of that merry season, namely Shrove Tuesday, or on the firstday of Lent, namely Ash Wednesday. The date of the other ceremony—the Carrying orDriving out of Death, as it is commonly called—is not so uniformly fixed. Generally it is thefourth Sunday in Lent, which hence goes by the name of Dead Sunday; but in some placesthe celebration falls a week earlier, in others, as among the Czechs of Bohemia, a week later,while in certain German villages of Moravia it is held on the first Sunday after Easter.Perhaps, as has been suggested, the date may originally have been variable, depending onthe appearance of the first swallow or some other herald of the spring. Some writers regardthe ceremony as Slavonic in its origin. Grimm thought it was a festival of the New Year withPage 236"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"the old Slavs, who began their year in March. We shall first take examples, of the mimicdeath of the Carnival, which always falls before the other in the calendar.At Frosinone, in Latium, about half-way between Rome and Naples, the dull monotony of lifein a provincial Italian town is agreeably broken on the last day of the Carnival by the ancientfestival known as the Radica. About four o’clock in the afternoon the town band, playing livelytunes and followed by a great crowd, proceeds to the Piazza del Plebiscito, where is the Sub-Prefecture as well as the rest of the Government buildings. Here, in the middle of the square,the eyes of the expectant multitude are greeted by the sight of an immense car decked withmany-coloured festoons and drawn by four horses. Mounted on the car is a huge chair, onwhich sits enthroned the majestic figure of the Carnival, a man of stucco about nine feet highwith a rubicund and smiling countenance. Enormous boots, a tin helmet like those whichgrace the heads of officers of the Italian marine, and a coat of many colours embellished withstrange devices, adorn the outward man of this stately personage. His left hand rests on thearm of the chair, while with his right he gracefully salutes the crowd, being moved to this actof civility by a string which is pulled by a man who modestly shrinks from publicity under themercy-seat. And now the crowd, surging excitedly round the car, gives vent to its feelings inwild cries of joy, gentle and simple being mixed up together and all dancing furiously theSaltarello. A special feature of the festival is that every one must carry in his hand what iscalled a radica (“root”), by which is meant a huge leaf of the aloe or rather the agave. Anyone who ventured into the crowd without such a leaf would be unceremoniously hustled out ofit, unless indeed he bore as a substitute a large cabbage at the end of a long stick or a bunchof grass curiously plaited. When the multitude, after a short turn, has escorted the slow-mov-ing car to the gate of the Sub-Prefecture, they halt, and the car, jolting over the unevenground, rumbles into the courtyard. A hush now falls on the crowd, their subdued voicessounding, according to the description of one who has heard them, like the murmur of a trou-bled sea. All eyes are turned anxiously to the door from which the Sub-Prefect himself andthe other representatives of the majesty of the law are expected to issue and pay their hom-age to the hero of the hour. A few moments of suspense and then a storm of cheers andhand-clapping salutes the appearance of the dignitaries, as they file out and, descending thestaircase, take their place in the procession. The hymn of the Carnival is now thundered out,after which, amid a deafening roar, aloe leaves and cabbages are whirled aloft and descendimpartially on the heads of the just and the unjust, who lend fresh zest to the proceedings byengaging in a free fight. When these preliminaries have been concluded to the satisfaction ofall concerned, the procession gets under weigh. The rear is brought up by a cart laden withbarrels of wine and policemen, the latter engaged in the congenial task of serving out wine toall who ask for it, while a most internecine struggle, accompanied by a copious discharge ofyells, blows, and blasphemy, goes on among the surging crowd at the cart’s tail in their anxi-ety not to miss the glorious opportunity of intoxicating themselves at the public expense.Finally, after the procession has paraded the principal streets in this majestic manner, the effi-gy of Carnival is taken to the middle of a public square, stripped of his finery, laid on a pile ofwood, and burnt amid the cries of the multitude, who thundering out once more the song ofthe Carnival fling their so-called “roots” on the pyre and give themselves up without restraintto the pleasures of the dance.In the Abruzzi a pasteboard figure of the Carnival is carried by four grave-diggers with pipesin their mouths and bottles of wine slung at their shoulder-belts. In front walks the wife of theCarnival, dressed in mourning and dissolved in tears. From time to time the company halts,and while the wife addresses the sympathising public, the grave-diggers refresh the innerman with a pull at the bottle. In the open square the mimic corpse is laid on a pyre, and to thePage 237"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"roll of drums, the shrill screams of the women, and the gruffer cries of the men a light is set toit. While the figure burns, chestnuts are thrown about among the crowd. Sometimes theCarnival is represented by a straw-man at the top of a pole which is borne through the townby a troop of mummers in the course of the afternoon. When evening comes on, four of themummers hold out a quilt or sheet by the corners, and the figure of the Carnival is made totumble into it. The procession is then resumed, the performers weeping crocodile tears andemphasising the poignancy of their grief by the help of saucepans and dinner bells.Sometimes, again, in the Abruzzi the dead Carnival is personified by a living man who lies ina coffin, attended by another who acts the priest and dispenses holy water in great profusionfrom a bathing tub.At Lerida, in Catalonia, the funeral of the Carnival was witnessed by an English traveller in1877. On the last Sunday of the Carnival a grand procession of infantry, cavalry, and maskersof many sorts, some on horseback and some in carriages, escorted the grand car of HisGrace Pau Pi, as the effigy was called, in triumph through the principal streets. For three daysthe revelry ran high, and then at midnight on the last day of the Carnival the same processionagain wound through the streets, but under a different aspect and for a different end. The tri-umphal car was exchanged for a hearse, in which reposed the effigy of his dead Grace: atroop of maskers, who in the first procession had played the part of Students of Folly withmany a merry quip and jest, now, robed as priests and bishops, paced slowly along holdingaloft huge lighted tapers and singing a dirge. All the mummers wore crape, and all the horse-men carried blazing flambeaux. Down the high street, between the lofty, many-storeyed andbalconied houses, where every window, every balcony, every housetop was crammed with adense mass of spectators, all dressed and masked in fantastic gorgeousness, the processiontook its melancholy way. Over the scene flashed and played the shifting cross-lights andshadows from the moving torches: red and blue Bengal lights flared up and died out again;and above the trampling of the horses and the measured tread of the marching multitude rosethe voices of the priests chanting the requiem, while the military bands struck in with thesolemn roll of the muffled drums. On reaching the principal square the procession halted, aburlesque funeral oration was pronounced over the defunct Pau Pi, and the lights were extin-guished. Immediately the devil and his angels darted from the crowd, seized the body andfled away with it, hotly pursued by the whole multitude, yelling, screaming, and cheering.Naturally the fiends were overtaken and dispersed; and the sham corpse, rescued from theirclutches, was laid in a grave that had been made ready for its reception. Thus the Carnival of1877 at Lerida died and was buried.Aceremony of the same sort is observed in Provence on Ash Wednesday. An effigy calledCaramantran, whimsically attired, is drawn in a chariot or borne on a litter, accompanied bythe populace in grotesque costumes, who carry gourds full of wine and drain them with all themarks, real or affected, of intoxication. At the head of the procession are some men disguisedas judges and barristers, and a tall gaunt personage who masquerades as Lent; behind themfollow young people mounted on miserable hacks and attired as mourners who pretend tobewail the fate that is in store for Caramantran. In the principal square the procession halts,the tribunal is constituted, and Caramantran placed at the bar. After a formal trial he is sen-tenced to death amid the groans of the mob: the barrister who defended him embraces hisclient for the last time: the officers of justice do their duty: the condemned is set with his backto a wall and hurried into eternity under a shower of stones. The sea or a river receives hismangled remains. Throughout nearly the whole of the Ardennes it was and still is customaryon Ash Wednesday to burn an effigy which is supposed to represent the Carnival, whileappropriate verses are sung round about the blazing figure. Very often an attempt is made toPage 238"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"fashion the effigy in the likeness of the husband who is reputed to be least faithful to his wifeof any in the village. As might perhaps have been anticipated, the distinction of being selectedfor portraiture under these painful circumstances has a slight tendency to breed domesticjars, especially when the portrait is burnt in front of the house of the gay deceiver whom itrepresents, while a powerful chorus of caterwauls, groans, and other melodious sounds bearspublic testimony to the opinion which his friends and neighbours entertain of his privatevirtues. In some villages of the Ardennes a young man of flesh and blood, dressed up in hayand straw, used to act the part of Shrove Tuesday (Mardi Gras), as the personification of theCarnival is often called in France after the last day of the period which he personates. He wasbrought before a mock tribunal, and being condemned to death was placed with his back to awall, like a soldier at a military execution, and fired at with blank cartridges. At Vrigne-aux-Bois one of these harmless buffoons, named Thierry, was accidentally killed by a wad thathad been left in a musket of the firing-party. When poor Shrove Tuesday dropped under thefire, the applause was loud and long, he did it so naturally; but when he did not get up again,they ran to him and found him a corpse. Since then there have been no more of these mockexecutions in the Ardennes.In Normandy on the evening of Ash Wednesday it used to be the custom to hold a celebrationcalled the Burial of Shrove Tuesday. A squalid effigy scantily clothed in rags, a battered oldhat crushed down on his dirty face, his great round paunch stuffed with straw, representedthe disreputable old rake who, after a long course of dissipation, was now about to suffer forhis sins. Hoisted on the shoulders of a sturdy fellow, who pretended to stagger under the bur-den, this popular personification of the Carnival promenaded the streets for the last time in amanner the reverse of triumphal. Preceded by a drummer and accompanied by a jeering rab-ble, among whom the urchins and all the tag-rag and bobtail of the town mustered in greatforce, the figure was carried about by the flickering light of torches to the discordant din ofshovels and tongs, pots and pans, horns and kettles, mingled with hootings, groans, andhisses. From time to time the procession halted, and a champion of morality accused the bro-ken-down old sinner of all the excesses he had committed and for which he was now about tobe burned alive. The culprit, having nothing to urge in his own defence, was thrown on aheap of straw, a torch was put to it, and a great blaze shot up, to the delight of the childrenwho frisked round it screaming out some old popular verses about the death of the Carnival.Sometimes the effigy was rolled down the slope of a hill before being burnt. At Saint-Lô theragged effigy of Shrove Tuesday was followed by his widow, a big burly lout dressed as awoman with a crape veil, who emitted sounds of lamentation and woe in a stentorian voice.After being carried about the streets on a litter attended by a crowd of maskers, the figurewas thrown into the River Vire. The final scene has been graphically described by MadameOctave Feuillet as she witnessed it in her childhood some sixty years ago. “My parents invitedfriends to see, from the top of the tower of Jeanne Couillard, the funeral procession passing.It was there that, quaffing lemonade—the only refreshment allowed because of the fast—wewitnessed at nightfall a spectacle of which I shallalways preserve a lively recollection. At our feet flowed the Vire under its old stone bridge. Onthe middle of the bridge lay the figure of ShroveTuesday on a litter of leaves, surrounded by scores of maskers dancing, singing, and carryingtorches. Some of them in their motley costumes ranalong the parapet like fiends. The rest, worn out with their revels, sat on the posts and dozed.Soon the dancing stopped, and some of the troop,seizing a torch, set fire to the effigy, after which they flung it into the river with redoubledshouts and clamour. The man of straw, soaked withresin, floated away burning down the stream of the Vire, lighting up with its funeral fires thePage 239"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"woods on the bank and the battlements of the oldcastle in which Louis XI. and Francis I. had slept. When the last glimmer of the blazing phan-tom had vanished, like a falling star, at the end of the valley, every one withdrew, crowd andmaskers alike, and we quitted the ramparts with our guests.”In the neighbourhood of Tübingen on Shrove Tuesday a straw-man, called the ShrovetideBear, is made up; he is dressed in a pair of old trousers, and a fresh black-pudding or twosquirts filled with blood are inserted in his neck. After a formal condemnation he is beheaded,laid in a coffin, and on Ash Wednesday is buried in the churchyard. This is called “Burying theCarnival.” Amongst some of the Saxons of Transylvania the Carnival is hanged. Thus atBraller on Ash Wednesday or Shrove Tuesday two white and two chestnut horses draw asledge on which is placed a straw-man swathed in a white cloth; beside him is a cart-wheelwhich is kept turning round. Two lads disguised as old men follow the sledge lamenting. Therest of the village lads, mounted on horseback and decked with ribbons, accompany the pro-cession, which is headed by two girls crowned with evergreen and drawn in a waggon orsledge. A trial is held under a tree, at which lads disguised as soldiers pronounce sentence ofdeath. The two old men try to rescue the straw-man and to fly with him, but to no purpose; heis caught by the two girls and handed over to the executioner, who hangs him on a tree. Invain the old men try to climb up the tree and take him down; they always tumble down, and atlast in despair they throw themselves on the ground and weep and howl for the hanged man.An official then makes a speech in which he declares that the Carnival was condemned todeath because he had done them harm, by wearing out their shoes and making them tiredand sleepy. At the “Burial of Carnival” in Lechrain, a man dressed as a woman in blackclothes is carried on a litter or bier by four men; he is lamented over by men disguised aswomen in black clothes, then thrown down before the village dung-heap, drenched with water,buried in the dung-heap, and covered with straw. On the evening of Shrove Tuesday theEsthonians make a straw figure called metsik or “wood-spirit”; one year it is dressed with aman’s coat and hat, next year with a hood and a petticoat. This figure is stuck on a long pole,carried across the boundary of the village with loud cries of joy, and fastened to the top of atree in the wood. The ceremony is believed to be a protection against all kinds of misfortune.Sometimes at these Shrovetide or Lenten ceremonies the resurrection of the pretended deadperson is enacted. Thus, in some parts of Swabia on Shrove Tuesday Dr. Iron-Beard profess-es to bleed a sick man, who thereupon falls as dead to the ground; but the doctor at lastrestores him to life by blowing air into him through a tube. In the Harz Mountains, whenCarnival is over, a man is laid on a baking-trough and carried with dirges to the grave; but inthe grave a glass of brandy is buried instead of the man. A speech is delivered and then thepeople return to the village-green or meeting-place, where they smoke the long clay pipeswhich are distributed at funerals. On the morning of Shrove Tuesday in the following year thebrandy is dug up and the festival begins by every one tasting the spirit which, as the phrasegoes, has come to life again.3. CARRYING OUT DEATHThe ceremony of “Carrying out Death” presents much the same features as “Burying theCarnival”; except that the carrying out of Death is generally followed by a ceremony, or atleast accompanied by a profession, of bringing in Summer, Spring, or Life. Thus in MiddleFranken, a province of Bavaria, on the fourth Sunday in Lent, the village urchins used tomake a straw effigy of Death, which they carried about with burlesque pomp through thestreets, and afterwards burned with loud cries beyond the bounds. The Frankish custom isPage 240"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"thus described by a writer of the sixteenth century: “At Mid-Lent, the season when the churchbids us rejoice, the young people of my native country make a straw image of Death, and fas-tening it to a pole carry it with shouts to the neighbouring villages. By some they are kindlyreceived, and after being refreshed with milk, peas, and dried pears, the usual food of thatseason, are sent home again. Others, however, treat them with anything but hospitality; for,looking on them as harbingers of misfortune, to wit of death, they drive them from theirboundaries with weapons and insults.” In the villages near Erlangen, when the fourth Sundayin Lent came around, the peasant girls used to dress themselves in all their finery with flow-ers in their hair. Thus attired they repaired to the neighbouring town, carrying puppets whichwere adorned with leaves and covered with white cloths. These they took from house tohouse in pairs, stopping at every door where they expected to receive something, and singinga few lines in which they announced that it was Mid-Lent and that they were about to throwDeath into the water. When they had collected some trifling gratuities they went to the riverRegnitz and flung the puppets representing Death into the stream. This was done to ensure afruitful and prosperous year; further, it was considered a safeguard against pestilence andsudden death. At Nuremberg girls of seven to eighteen years of age go through the streetsbearing a little open coffin, in which is a doll hidden under a shroud. Others carry a beechbranch, with an apple fastened to it for a head, in an open box. They sing, “We carry Deathinto the water, it is well,” or “We carry Death into the water, carry him in and out again.” Insome parts of Bavaria down to 1780 it was believed that a fatal epidemic would ensue if thecustom of “Carrying out Death” were not observed.In some villages of Thüringen, on the fourth Sunday of Lent, the children used to carry a pup-pet of birchen twigs through the village, and then threw it into a pool, while they sang, “Wecarry the old Death out behind the herdman’s old house; we have got Summer, and Kroden’s(?) power is destroyed.” At Debschwitz or Dobschwitz, near Gera, the ceremony of “Drivingout Death” is or was annually observed on the first of March. The young people make up afigure of straw or the like materials, dress it in old clothes, which they have begged fromhouses in the village, and carry it out and throw it into the river. On returning to the villagethey break the good news to the people, and receive eggs and other victuals as a reward.The ceremony is or was supposed to purify the village and to protect the inhabitants fromsickness and plague. In other villages of Thüringen, in which the population was originallySlavonic, the carrying out of the puppet is accompanied with the singing of a song, whichbegins, “Now we carry Death out of the village and Spring into the village.” At the end of theseventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century the custom was observed in Thüringenas follows. The boys and girls made an effigy of straw or the like materials, but the shape ofthe figure varied from year to year. In one year it would represent an old man, in the next anold woman, in the third a young man, and in the fourth a maiden, and the dress of the figurevaried with the character it personated. There used to be a sharp contest as to where the effi-gy was to be made, for the people thought that the house from which it was carried forthwould not be visited with death that year. Having been made, the puppet was fastened to apole and carried by a girl if it represented an old man, but by a boy if it represented an oldwoman. Thus it was borne in procession, the young people holding sticks in their hands andsinging that they were driving out Death. When they came to water they threw the effigy into itand ran hastily back, fearing that it might jump on their shoulders and wring their necks. Theyalso took care not to touch it, lest it should dry them up. On their return they beat the cattlewith the sticks, believing that this would make the animals fat or fruitful. Afterwards they visit-ed the house or houses from which they had carried the image of Death; where they receiveda dole of half-boiled peas. The custom of “Carrying out Death” was practised also in Saxony.At Leipsic the bastards and public women used to make a straw effigy of Death every year atPage 241"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Mid-Lent. This they carried through all the streets with songs and showed it to the young mar-ried women. Finally they threw it into the river Parthe. By this ceremony they professed tomake the young wives fruitful, to purify the city, and to protect the inhabitants for that yearfrom plague and other epidemics.Ceremonies of the same sort are observed at Mid-Lent in Silesia. Thus in many places thegrown girls with the help of the young men dress up a straw figure with women’s clothes andcarry it out of the village towards the setting sun. At the boundary they strip it of its clothes,tear it in pieces, and scatter the fragments about the fields. This is called “Burying Death.” Asthey carry the image out, they sing that they are about to bury Death under an oak, that hemay depart from the people. Sometimes the song runs that they are bearing Death over hilland dale to return no more. In the Polish neighbourhood of Gross-Strehlitz the puppet iscalled Goik. It is carried on horseback and thrown into the nearest water. The people thinkthat the ceremony protects them from sickness of every sort in the coming year. In the dis-tricts of Wohlau and Guhrau the image of Death used to be thrown over the boundary of thenext village. But as the neighbours feared to receive the ill-omened figure, they were on thelook-out to repel it, and hard knocks were often exchanged between the two parties. In somePolish parts of Upper Silesia the effigy, representing an old woman, goes by the name ofMarzana, the goddess of death. It is made in the house where the last death occurred, and iscarried on a pole to the boundary of the village, where it is thrown into a pond or burnt. AtPolkwitz the custom of “Carrying out Death” fell into abeyance; but an outbreak of fatal sick-ness which followed the intermission of the ceremony induced the people to resume it.In Bohemia the children go out with a straw-man, representing Death, to the end of the vil-lage, where they burn it, singing— “Now carry we Death out of the village, The new Summer into the village, Welcome, dear Summer, Green little corn.”At Tabor in Bohemia the figure of Death is carried out of the town and flung from a high rockinto the water, while they sing—“Death swims on the water, Summer will soon be here, We carried Death away for you We brought the Summer. And do thou, O holy Marketa, Give us a good year For wheat and for rye.”In other parts of Bohemia they carry Death to the end of the village, singing—“We carry Death out of the village, And the New Year into the village. Dear Spring, we bid you welcome, Green grass, we bid you welcome.”Behind the village they erect a pyre, on which they burn the straw figure, reviling and scoffingPage 242"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"at it the while. Then they return, singing—“We have carried away Death, And brought Life back. He has taken up his quarters in the village, Therefore sing joyous songs.”In some German villages of Moravia, as in Jassnitz and Seitendorf, the young folk assembleon the third Sunday in Lent and fashion a straw-man, who is generally adorned with a fur capand a pair of old leathern hose, if such are to be had. The effigy is then hoisted on a pole andcarried by the lads and lasses out into the open fields. On the way they sing a song, in whichit is said that they are carrying Death away and bringing dear Summer into the house, andwith Summer the May and the flowers. On reaching an appointed place they dance in a circleround the effigy with loud shouts and screams, then suddenly rush at it and tear it to pieceswith their hands. Lastly, the pieces are thrown together in a heap, the pole is broken, and fireis set to the whole. While it burns the troop dances merrily round it, rejoicing at the victorywon by Spring; and when the fire has nearly died out they go to the householders to beg for apresent of eggs wherewith to hold a feast, taking care to give as a reason for the request thatthey have carried Death out and away.The preceding evidence shows that the effigy of Death is often regarded with fear and treatedwith marks of hatred and abhorrence. Thus the anxiety of the villagers to transfer the figurefrom their own to their neighbours’ land, and the reluctance of the latter to receive the omi-nous guest, are proof enough of the dread which it inspires. Further, in Lusatia and Silesiathe puppet is sometimes made to look in at the window of a house, and it is believed thatsome one in the house will die within the year unless his life is redeemed by the payment ofmoney. Again, after throwing the effigy away, the bearers sometimes run home lest Deathshould follow them, and if one of them falls in running, it is believed that he will die within theyear. At Chrudim, in Bohemia, the figure of Death is made out of a cross, with a head andmask stuck at the top, and a shirt stretched out on it. On the fifth Sunday in Lent the boystake this effigy to the nearest brook or pool, and standing in a line throw it into the water.Then they all plunge in after it; but as soon as it is caught no one more may enter the water.The boy who did not enter the water or entered it last will die within the year, and he isobliged to carry the Death back to the village. The effigy is then burned. On the other hand, itis believed that no one will die within the year in the house out of which the figure of Deathhas been carried; and the village out of which Death has been driven is sometimes supposedto be protected against sickness and plague. In some villages of Austrian Silesia on theSaturday before Dead Sunday an effigy is made of old clothes, hay, and straw, for the pur-pose of driving Death out of the village. On Sunday the people, armed with sticks and straps,assemble before the house where the figure is lodged. Four lads then draw the effigy bycords through the village amid exultant shouts, while all the others beat it with their sticks andstraps. On reaching a field which belongs to a neighbouring village they lay down the figure,cudgel it soundly, and scatter the fragments over the field. The people believe that the villagefrom which Death has been thus carried out will be safe from any infectious disease for thewhole year.4. BRINGING IN SUMMERIn the preceding ceremonies the return of Spring, Summer, or Life, as a sequel to the expul-sion of Death, is only implied or at most announced. In the following ceremonies it is plainlyPage 243"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"enacted. Thus in some parts of Bohemia the effigy of Death is drowned by being thrown intothe water at sunset; then the girls go out into the wood and cut down a young tree with agreen crown, hang a doll dressed as a woman on it, deck the whole with green, red, andwhite ribbons, and march in procession with their Líto (Summer) into the village, collectinggifts and singing— “Death swims in the water, Spring comes to visit us, With eggs that are red, With yellow pancakes. We carried Death out of the village, We are carrying Summer into the village.”In many Silesian villages the figure of Death, after being treated with respect, is stript of itsclothes and flung with curses into the water, or torn to pieces in a field. Then the young folkrepair to a wood, cut down a small fir-tree, peel the trunk, and deck it with festoons of ever-greens, paper roses, painted egg-shells, motley bits of cloth, and so forth. The tree thusadorned is called Summer or May. Boys carry it from house to house singing appropriatesongs and begging for presents. Among their songs is the following: “We have carried Death out, We are bringing the dear Summer back, The Summer and the May And all the flowers gay.”Sometimes they also bring back from the wood a prettily adorned figure, which goes by thename of Summer, May, or the Bride; in the Polish districts it is called Dziewanna, the goddessof spring.At Eisenach on the fourth Sunday in Lent young people used to fasten a straw-man, repre-senting Death, to a wheel, which they trundled to the top of a hill. Then setting fire to the fig-ure they allowed it and the wheel to roll down the slope. Next day they cut a tall fir-tree,tricked it out with ribbons, and set it up in the plain. The men then climbed the tree to fetchdown the ribbons. In Upper Lusatia the figure of Death, made of straw and rags, is dressed ina veil furnished by the last bride and a shirt provided by the house in which the last deathtook place. Thus arrayed the figure is stuck on the end of a long pole and carried at full speedby the tallest and strongest girl, while the rest pelt the effigy with sticks and stones. Whoeverhits it will be sure to live through the year. In this way Death is carried out of the village andthrown into the water or over the boundary of the next village. On their way home each onebreaks a green branch and carries it gaily with him till he reaches the village, when he throwsit away. Sometimes the young people of the next village, upon whose land the figure hasbeen thrown, run after them and hurl it back, not wishing to have Death among them. Hencethe two parties occasionally come to blows.In these cases Death is represented by the puppet which is thrown away, Summer or Life bythe branches or trees which are brought back. But sometimes a new potency of life seems tobe attributed to the image of Death itself, and by a kind of resurrection it becomes the instru-ment of the general revival. Thus in some parts of Lusatia women alone are concerned in car-rying out Death, and suffer no male to meddle with it. Attired in mourning, which they wearthe whole day, they make a puppet of straw, clothe it in a white shirt, and give it a broom inPage 244"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"one hand and a scythe in the other. Singing songs and pursued by urchins throwing stones,they carry the puppet to the village boundary, where they tear it in pieces. Then they cutdown a fine tree, hang the shirt on it, and carry it home singing. On the Feast of Ascensionthe Saxons of Braller, a village of Transylvania, not far from Hermannstadt, observe the cere-mony of “Carrying out Death” in the following manner. After morning service all the school-girls repair to the house of one of their number, and there dress up the Death. This is done bytying a threshed-out sheaf of corn into a rough semblance of a head and body, while the armsare simulated by a broomstick thrust through it horizontally. The figure is dressed in the holi-day attire of a young peasant woman, with a red hood, silver brooches, and a profusion of rib-bons at the arms and breast. The girls bustle at their work, for soon the bells will be ringing tovespers, and the Death must be ready in time to be placed at the open window, that all thepeople may see it on their way to church. When vespers are over, the longed-for moment hascome for the first procession with the Death to begin; it is a privilege that belongs to theschool-girls alone. Two of the older girls seize the figure by the arms and walk in front: all therest follow two and two. Boys may take no part in the procession, but they troop after it gaz-ing with open-mouthed admiration at the “beautiful Death.” So the procession goes through allthe streets of the village, the girls singing the old hymn that begins— “Gott mein Vater, deine Liebe Reicht so weit der Himmel ist,” to a tune that differs from the ordinary one. When the procession has wound its way throughevery street, the girls go to another house, and having shut the door against the eager pryingcrowd of boys who follow at their heels, they strip the Death and pass the naked truss ofstraw out of the window to the boys, who pounce on it, run out of the village with it withoutsinging, and fling the dilapidated effigy into the neighbouring brook. This done, the secondscene of the little drama begins. While the boys were carrying away the Death out of the vil-lage, the girls remained in the house, and one of them is now dressed in all the finery whichhad been worn by the effigy. Thus arrayed she is led in procession through all the streets tothe singing of the same hymn as before. When the procession is over they all betake them-selves to the house of the girl who played the leading part. Here a feast awaits them fromwhich also the boys are excluded. It is a popular belief that the children may safely begin toeat gooseberries and other fruit after the day on which Death has thus been carried out; forDeath, which up to that time lurked especially in gooseberries, is now destroyed. Further, theymay now bathe with impunity out of doors. Very similar is the ceremony which, down torecent years, was observed in some of the German villages of Moravia. Boys and girls meton the afternoon of the first Sunday after Easter, and together fashioned a puppet of straw torepresent Death. Decked with bright-coloured ribbons and cloths, and fastened to the top of along pole, the effigy was then borne with singing and clamour to the nearest height, where itwas stript of its gay attire and thrown or rolled down the slope. One of the girls was nextdressed in the gauds taken from the effigy of Death, and with her at its head the processionmoved back to the village. In some villages the practice is to bury the effigy in the place thathas the most evil reputation of all the country-side: others throw it into running water.In the Lusatian ceremony described above, the tree which is brought home after the destruc-tion of the figure of Death is plainly equivalent to the trees or branches which, in the preced-ing customs, were brought back as representatives of Summer or Life, after Death had beenthrown away or destroyed. But the transference of the shirt worn by the effigy of Death to thetree clearly indicates that the tree is a kind of revivification, in a new form, of the destroyedeffigy. This comes out also in the Transylvanian and Moravian customs: the dressing of a girlPage 245"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"in the clothes worn by the Death, and the leading her about the village to the same songwhich had been sung when the Death was being carried about, show that she is intended tobe a kind of resuscitation of the being whose effigy has just been destroyed. These examplestherefore suggest that the Death whose demolition is represented in these ceremonies cannotbe regarded as the purely destructive agent which we understand by Death. If the tree whichis brought back as an embodiment of the reviving vegetation of spring is clothed in the shirtworn by the Death which has just been destroyed, the object certainly cannot be to check andcounteract the revival of vegetation: it can only be to foster and promote it. Therefore thebeing which has just been destroyed—the so-called Death—-must be supposed to beendowed with a vivifying and quickening influence, which it can communicate to the vegetableand even the animal world. This ascription of a life-giving virtue to the figure of Death is putbeyond a doubt by the custom, observed in some places, of taking pieces of the straw effigyof Death and placing them in the fields to make the crops grow, or in the manger to make thecattle thrive. Thus in Spachendorf, a village of Austrian Silesia, the figure of Death, made ofstraw, brushwood, and rags, is carried with wild songs to an open place outside the villageand there burned, and while it is burning a general struggle takes place for the pieces, whichare pulled out of the flames with bare hands. Each one who secures a fragment of the effigyties it to a branch of the largest tree in his garden, or buries it in his field, in the belief that thiscauses the crops to grow better. In the Troppau district of Austrian Silesia the straw figurewhich the boys make on the fourth Sunday in Lent is dressed by the girls in woman’s clothesand hung with ribbons, necklace, and garlands. Attached to a long pole it is carried out of thevillage, followed by a troop of young people of both sexes, who alternately frolic, lament, andsing songs. Arrived at its destination—a field outside the village—the figure is stripped of itsclothes and ornaments; then the crowd rushes at it and tears it to bits, scuffling for the frag-ments. Every one tries to get a wisp of the straw of which the effigy was made, because sucha wisp, placed in the manger, is believed to make the cattle thrive. Or the straw is put in thehens’ nest, it being supposed that this prevents the hens from carrying away their eggs, andmakes them brood much better. The same attribution of a fertilising power to the figure ofDeath appears in the belief that if the bearers of the figure, after throwing it away, beat cattlewith their sticks, this will render the beasts fat or prolific. Perhaps the sticks had been previ-ously used to beat the Death, and so had acquired the fertilising power ascribed to the effigy.We have seen, too, that at Leipsic a straw effigy of Death was shown to young wives to makethem fruitful.It seems hardly possible to separate from the May-trees the trees or branches which arebrought into the village after the destruction of the Death. The bearers who bring them in pro-fess to be bringing in the Summer, therefore the trees obviously represent the Summer;indeed in Silesia they are commonly called the Summer or the May, and the doll which issometimes attached to the Summer-tree is a duplicate representative of the Summer, just asthe May is sometimes represented at the same time by a May-tree and a May Lady. Further,the Summer-trees are adorned like May-trees with ribbons and so on; like May-trees, whenlarge, they are planted in the ground and climbed up; and like May-trees, when small, theyare carried from door to door by boys or girls singing songs and collecting money. And as if todemonstrate the identity of the two sets of customs the bearers of the Summer-tree some-times announce that they are bringing in the Summer and the May. The customs, therefore,of bringing in the May and bringing in the Summer are essentially the same; and theSummer-tree is merely another form of the May-tree, the only distinction (besides that ofname) being in the time at which they are respectively brought in; for while the May-tree isusually fetched in on the first of May or at Whitsuntide, the Summer-tree is fetched in on thefourth Sunday in Lent. Therefore, if the May-tree is an embodiment of the tree-spirit or spirit ofPage 246"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"vegetation, the Summer-tree must likewise be an embodiment of the tree-spirit or spirit ofvegetation. But we have seen that the Summer-tree is in some cases a revivification of theeffigy of Death. It follows, therefore, that in these cases the effigy called Death must be anembodiment of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation. This inference is confirmed, first, by thevivifying and fertilising influence which the fragments of the effigy of Death are believed toexercise both on vegetable and on animal life; for this influence, as we saw in an earlier partof this work, is supposed to be a special attribute of the tree-spirit. It is confirmed, secondly,by observing that the effigy of Death is sometimes decked with leaves or made of twigs,branches, hemp, or a threshed-out sheaf of corn; and that sometimes it is hung on a little treeand so carried about by girls collecting money, just as is done with the May-tree and the MayLady, and with the Summer-tree and the doll attached to it. In short we are driven to regardthe expulsion of Death and the bringing in of Summer as, in some cases at least, merelyanother form of that death and revival of the spirit of vegetation in spring which we saw enact-ed in the killing and resurrection of the Wild Man. The burial and resurrection of the Carnivalis probably another way of expressing the same idea. The interment of the representative ofthe Carnival under a dung-heap is natural, if he is supposed to possess a quickening and fer-tilising influence like that ascribed to the effigy of Death. The Esthonians, indeed, who carrythe straw figure out of the village in the usual way on Shrove Tuesday, do not call it theCarnival, but the Wood-spirit (Metsik), and they clearly indicate the identity of the effigy withthe wood-spirit by fixing it to the top of a tree in the wood, where it remains for a year, and isbesought almost daily with prayers and offerings to protect the herds; for like a true wood-spirit the Metsik is a patron of cattle. Sometimes the Metsik is made of sheaves of corn.Thus we may fairly conjecture that the names Carnival, Death, and Summer are comparative-ly late and inadequate expressions for the beings personified or embodied in the customswith which we have been dealing. The very abstractness of the names bespeaks a modernorigin; for the personification of times and seasons like the Carnival and Summer, or of anabstract notion like death, is not primitive. But the ceremonies themselves bear the stamp ofa dateless antiquity; therefore we can hardly help supposing that in their origin the ideaswhich they embodied were of a more simple and concrete order. The notion of a tree, per-haps of a particular kind of tree (for some savages have no word for tree in general), or evenof an individual tree, is sufficiently concrete to supply a basis from which by a gradual processof generalisation the wider idea of a spirit of vegetation might be reached. But this generalidea of vegetation would readily be confounded with the season in which it manifests itself;hence the substitution of Spring, Summer, or May for the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetationwould be easy and natural. Again, the concrete notion of the dying tree or dying vegetationwould by a similar process of generalisation glide into a notion of death in general; so that thepractice of carrying out the dying or dead vegetation in spring, as a preliminary to its revival,would in time widen out into an attempt to banish Death in general from the village or district.The view that in these spring ceremonies Death meant originally the dying or dead vegetationof winter has the high support of W. Mannhardt; and he confirms it by the analogy of thename Death as applied to the spirit of the ripe corn. Commonly the spirit of the ripe corn isconceived, not as dead, but as old, and hence it goes by the name of the Old Man or the OldWoman. But in some places the last sheaf cut at harvest, which is generally believed to bethe seat of the corn spirit, is called “the Dead One”: children are warned against entering thecorn-fields because Death sits in the corn; and, in a game played by Saxon children inTransylvania at the maize harvest, Death is represented by a child completely covered withmaize leaves.5. BATTLE OF SUMMER AND WINTERPage 247"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Sometimes in the popular customs of the peasantry the contrast between the dormant powersof vegetation in winter and their awakening vitality in spring takes the form of a dramatic con-test between actors who play the parts respectively of Winter and Summer. Thus in the townsof Sweden on May Day two troops of young men on horseback used to meet as if for mortalcombat. One of them was led by a representative of Winter clad in furs, who threw snowballsand ice in order to prolong the cold weather. The other troop was commanded by a represen-tative of Summer covered with fresh leaves and flowers. In the sham fight which followed theparty of Summer came off victorious, and the ceremony ended with a feast. Again, in theregion of the middle Rhine, a representative of Summer clad in ivy combats a representativeof Winter clad in straw or moss and finally gains a victory over him. The vanquished foe isthrown to the ground and stripped of his casing of straw, which is torn to pieces and scatteredabout, while the youthful comrades of the two champions sing a song to commemorate thedefeat of Winter by Summer. Afterwards they carry about a summer garland or branch andcollect gifts of eggs and bacon from house to house. Sometimes the champion who acts thepart of Summer is dressed in leaves and flowers and wears a chaplet of flowers on his head.In the Palatinate this mimic conflict takes place on the fourth Sunday in Lent. All over Bavariathe same drama used to be acted on the same day, and it was still kept up in some placesdown to the middle of the nineteenth century or later. While Summer appeared clad all ingreen, decked with fluttering ribbons, and carrying a branch in blossom or a little tree hungwith apples and pears, Winter was muffled up in cap and mantle of fur and bore in his hand asnow-shovel or a flail. Accompanied by their respective retinues dressed in correspondingattire, they went through all the streets of the village, halting before the houses and singingstaves of old songs, for which they received presents of bread, eggs, and fruit. Finally, after ashort struggle, Winter was beaten by Summer and ducked in the village well or driven out ofthe village with shouts and laughter into the forest.At Goepfritz in Lower Austria, two men personating Summer and Winter used to go fromhouse to house on Shrove Tuesday, and were everywhere welcomed by the children withgreat delight. The representative of Summer was clad in white and bore a sickle; his com-rade, who played the part of Winter, had a fur-cap on his head, his arms and legs wereswathed in straw, and he carried a flail. In every house they sang verses alternately. AtDrömling in Brunswick, down to the present time, the contest between Summer and Winter isacted every year at Whitsuntide by a troop of boys and a troop of girls. The boys rushsinging, shouting, and ringing bells from house to house to drive Winter away; after themcome the girls singing softly and led by a May Bride, all in bright dresses and decked withflowers and garlands to represent the genial advent of spring. Formerly the part of Winter wasplayed by a straw-man which the boys carried with them; now it is acted by a real man in dis-guise.Among the Central Esquimaux of North America the contest between representatives of sum-mer and winter, which in Europe has long degenerated into a mere dramatic performance, isstill kept up as a magical ceremony of which the avowed intention is to influence the weather.In autumn, when storms announce the approach of the dismal Arctic winter, the Esquimauxdivide themselves into two parties called respectively the ptarmigans and the ducks, theptarmigans comprising all persons born in winter, and the ducks all persons born in summer.Along rope of sealskin is then stretched out, and each party laying hold of one end of itseeks by tugging with might and main to drag the other party over to its side. If the ptarmi-gans get the worst of it, then summer has won the game and fine weather may be expectedto prevail through the winter.Page 248"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"6. DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF KOSTRUBONKOIn Russia funeral ceremonies like those of “Burying the Carnival” and “Carrying out Death”are celebrated under the names, not of Death or the Carnival, but of certain mythic figures,Kostrubonko, Kostroma, Kupalo, Lada, and Yarilo. These Russian ceremonies are observedboth in spring and at midsummer. Thus “in Little Russia it used to be the custom at Eastertideto celebrate the funeral of a being called Kostrubonko, the deity of the spring. A circle wasformed of singers who moved slowly around a girl who lay on the ground as if dead, and asthey went they sang: ‘Dead, dead is our Kostrubonko! Dead, dead is our dear one!’until the girl suddenly sprang up, on which the chorus joyfully exclaimed: ‘Come to life, come to life has our Kostrubonko! Come to life, come to life has our dear one!’” On the Eve of St. John (Midsummer Eve) a figure of Kupalo is made of straw and “is dressedin woman’s clothes, with a necklace and a floral crown. Then a tree is felled, and, after beingdecked with ribbons, is set up on some chosen spot. Near this tree, to which they give thename of Marena [Winter or Death], the straw figure is placed, together with a table, on whichstand spirits and viands. Afterwards a bonfire is lit, and the young men and maidens jumpover it in couples, carrying the figure with them. On the next day they strip the tree and thefigure of their ornaments, and throw them both into a stream.” On St. Peter’s Day, the twenty-ninth of June, or on the following Sunday, “the Funeral of Kostroma” or of Lada or of Yarilo iscelebrated in Russia. In the Governments of Penza and Simbirsk the funeral used to be rep-resented as follows. A bonfire was kindled on the twenty-eighth of June, and on the next daythe maidens chose one of their number to play the part of Kostroma. Her companions salutedher with deep obeisances, placed her on a board, and carried her to the bank of a stream.There they bathed her in the water, while the oldest girl made a basket of lime-tree bark andbeat it like a drum. Then they returned to the village and ended the day with processions,games, and dances. In the Murom district Kostroma was represented by a straw figuredressed in woman’s clothes and flowers. This was laid in a trough and carried with songs tothe bank of a lake or river. Here the crowd divided into two sides, of which the one attackedand the other defended the figure. At last the assailants gained the day, stripped the figure ofits dress and ornaments, tore it in pieces, trod the straw of which it was made under foot, andflung it into the stream; while the defenders of the figure hid their faces in their hands andpretended to bewail the death of Kostroma. In the district of Kostroma the burial of Yarilo wascelebrated on the twenty-ninth or thirtieth of June. The people chose an old man and gavehim a small coffin containing a Priapus-like figure representing Yarilo. This he carried out ofthe town, followed by women chanting dirges and expressing by their gestures grief anddespair. In the open fields a grave was dug, and into it the figure was lowered amid weepingand wailing, after which games and dances were begun, “calling to mind the funeral gamescelebrated in old times by the pagan Slavonians.” In Little Russia the figure of Yarilo was laidin a coffin and carried through the streets after sunset surrounded by drunken women, whokept repeating mournfully, “He is dead! he is dead!” The men lifted and shook the figure as ifthey were trying to recall the dead man to life. Then they said to the women, “Women, weepnot. I know what is sweeter than honey.” But the women continued to lament and chant, asPage 249"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"they do at funerals. “Of what was he guilty? He was so good. He will arise no more. O howshall we part from thee? What is life without thee? Arise, if only for a brief hour. But he risesnot, he not.” At last the Yarilo was buried in a grave.7. DEATH AND REVIVAL OF VEGETATIONThese Russian customs are plainly of the same nature as those which in Austria andGermany are known as “Carrying out Death.” Therefore if the interpretation here adopted ofthe latter is right, the Russian Kostrubonko, Yarilo, and the rest must also have been originallyembodiments of the spirit of vegetation, and their death must have been regarded as a nec-essary preliminary to their revival. The revival as a sequel to the death is enacted in the firstof the ceremonies described, the death and resurrection of Kostrubonko. The reason why insome of these Russian ceremonies the death of the spirit of vegetation is celebrated at mid-summer may be that the decline of summer is dated from Midsummer Day, after which thedays begin to shorten, and the sun sets out on his downward journey: “To the darksome hollows Where the frosts of winter lie.” Such a turning-point of the year, when vegetation might be thought to share the incipientthough still almost imperceptible decay of summer, might very well be chosen by primitiveman as a fit moment for resorting to those magic rites by which he hopes to stay the decline,or at least to ensure the revival, of plant life.But while the death of vegetation appears to have been represented in all, and its revival insome, of these spring and midsummer ceremonies, there are features in some of them whichcan hardly be explained on this hypothesis alone. The solemn funeral, the lamentations, andthe mourning attire, which often characterise these rites, are indeed appropriate at the deathof the beneficent spirit of vegetation. But what shall we say of the glee with which the effigy isoften carried out, of the sticks and stones with which it is assailed, and the taunts and curseswhich are hurled at it? What shall we say of the dread of the effigy evinced by the haste withwhich the bearers scamper home as soon as they have thrown it away, and by the belief thatsome one must soon die in any house into which it has looked? This dread might perhaps beexplained by a belief that there is a certain infectiousness in the dead spirit of vegetationwhich renders its approach dangerous. But this explanation, besides being rather strained,does not cover the rejoicings which often attend the carrying out of Death. We must thereforerecognise two distinct and seemingly opposite features in these ceremonies: on the onehand, sorrow for the death, and affection and respect for the dead; on the other hand, fearand hatred of the dead, and rejoicings at his death. How the former of these features is to beexplained I have attempted to show: how the latter came to be so closely associated with theformer is a question which I shall try to answer in the sequel.8. ANALOGOUS RITES IN INDIAIn the Kanagra district of India there is a custom observed by young girls in spring whichclosely resembles some of the European spring ceremonies just described. It is called theRalî Ka melâ, or fair of Ralî, the Ralî being a small painted earthen image of Siva or Pârvatî.The custom is in vogue all over the Kanagra district, and its celebration, which is entirely con-fined to young girls, lasts through most of Chet (March-April) up to the Sankrânt of Baisâkh(April). On a morning in March all the young girls of the village take small baskets of dûbPage 250"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"grass and flowers to an appointed place, where they throw them in a heap. Round this heapthey stand in a circle and sing. This goes on every day for ten days, till the heap of grass andflowers has reached a fair height. Then they cut in the jungle two branches, each with threeprongs at one end, and place them, prongs downwards, over the heap of flowers, so as tomake two tripods or pyramids. On the single uppermost points of these branches they get animage-maker to construct two clay images, one to represent Siva, and the other Pârvatî. Thegirls then divide themselves into two parties, one for Siva and one for Pârvatî, and marry theimages in the usual way, leaving out no part of the ceremony. After the marriage they have afeast, the cost of which is defrayed by contributions solicited from their parents. Then at thenext Sankrânt (Baisâkh) they all go together to the river-side, throw the images into a deeppool, and weep over the place, as though they were performing funeral obsequies. The boysof the neighbourhood often tease them by diving after the images, bringing them up, andwaving them about while the girls are crying over them. The object of the fair is said to be tosecure a good husband.That in this Indian ceremony the deities Siva and Pârvatî are conceived as spirits of vegeta-tion seems to be proved by the placing of their images on branches over a heap of grass andflowers. Here, as often in European folk-custom, the divinities of vegetation are representedin duplicate, by plants and by puppets. The marriage of these Indian deities in spring corre-sponds to the European ceremonies in which the marriage of the vernal spirits of vegetationis represented by the King and Queen of May, the May Bride, Bridegroom of the May, and soforth. The throwing of the images into the water, and the mourning for them, are the equiva-lents of the European customs of throwing the dead spirit of vegetation under the name ofDeath, Yarilo, Kostroma, and the rest, into the water and lamenting over it. Again, in India, asoften in Europe, the rite is performed exclusively by females. The notion that the ceremonyhelps to procure husbands for the girls can be explained by the quickening and fertilisinginfluence which the spirit of vegetation is believed to exert upon the life of man as well as ofplants.9. THE MAGIC SPRINGThe general explanation which we have been led to adopt of these and many similar cere-monies is that they are, or were in their origin, magical rites intended to ensure the revival ofnature in spring. The means by which they were supposed to effect this end were imitationand sympathy. Led astray by his ignorance of the true causes of things, primitive manbelieved that in order to produce the great phenomena of nature on which his life dependedhe had only to imitate them, and that immediately by a secret sympathy or mystic influencethe little drama which he acted in forest glade or mountain dell, on desert plain or wind-sweptshore, would be taken up and repeated by mightier actors on a vaster stage. He fancied thatby masquerading in leaves and flowers he helped the bare earth to clothe herself with ver-dure, and that by playing the death and burial of winter he drove that gloomy season away,and made smooth the path for the footsteps of returning spring. If we find it hard to throw our-selves even in fancy into a mental condition in which such things seem possible, we canmore easily picture to ourselves the anxiety which the savage, when he first began to lift histhoughts above the satisfaction of his merely animal wants, and to meditate on the causes ofthings, may have felt as to the continued operation of what we now call the laws of nature. Tous, familiar as we are with the conception of the uniformity and regularity with which the greatcosmic phenomena succeed each other, there seems little ground for apprehension that thecauses which produce these effects will cease to operate, at least within the near future. Butthis confidence in the stability of nature is bred only by the experience which comes of widePage 251"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"observation and long tradition; and the savage, with his narrow sphere of observation and hisshort-lived tradition, lacks the very elements of that experience which alone could set hismind at rest in face of the ever-changing and often menacing aspects of nature. No wonder,therefore, that he is thrown into a panic by an eclipse, and thinks that the sun or the moonwould surely perish, if he did not raise a clamour and shoot his puny shafts into the air todefend the luminaries from the monster who threatens to devour them. No wonder he is terri-fied when in the darkness of night a streak of sky is suddenly illumined by the flash of a mete-or, or the whole expanse of the celestial arch glows with the fitful light of the NorthernStreamers. Even phenomena which recur at fixed and uniform intervals may be viewed byhim with apprehension, before he has come to recognise the orderliness of their recurrence.The speed or slowness of his recognition of such periodic or cyclic changes in nature willdepend largely on the length of the particular cycle. The cycle, for example, of day and nightis everywhere, except in the polar regions, so short and hence so frequent that men probablysoon ceased to discompose themselves seriously as to the chance of its failing to recur,though the ancient Egyptians, as we have seen, daily wrought enchantments to bring back tothe east in the morning the fiery orb which had sunk at evening in the crimson west. But itwas far otherwise with the annual cycle of the seasons. To any man a year is a considerableperiod, seeing that the number of our years is but few at the best. To the primitive savage,with his short memory and imperfect means of marking the flight of time, a year may wellhave been so long that he failed to recognise it as a cycle at all, and watched the changingaspects of earth and heaven with a perpetual wonder, alternately delighted and alarmed, elat-ed and cast down, according as the vicissitudes of light and heat, of plant and animal life,ministered to his comfort or threatened his existence. In autumn when the withered leaveswere whirled about the forest by the nipping blast, and he looked up at the bare boughs,could he feel sure that they would ever be green again? As day by day the sun sank lowerand lower in the sky, could he be certain that the luminary would ever retrace his heavenlyroad? Even the waning moon, whose pale sickle rose thinner and thinner every night over therim of the eastern horizon, may have excited in his mind a fear lest, when it had wholly van-ished, there should be moons no more.These and a thousand such misgivings may have thronged the fancy and troubled the peaceof the man who first began to reflect on the mysteries of the world he lived in, and to takethought for a more distant future than the morrow. It was natural, therefore, that with suchthoughts and fears he should have done all that in him lay to bring back the faded blossom tothe bough, to swing the low sun of winter up to his old place in the summer sky, and torestore its orbed fulness to the silver lamp of the waning moon. We may smile at his vainendeavours if we please, but it was only by making a long series of experiments, of whichsome were almost inevitably doomed to failure, that man learned from experience the futilityof some of his attempted methods and the fruitfulness of others. After all, magical ceremoniesare nothing but experiments which have failed and which continue to be repeated merelybecause, for reasons which have already been indicated, the operator is unaware of their fail-ure. With the advance of knowledge these ceremonies either cease to be performed altogeth-er or are kept up from force of habit long after the intention with which they were institutedhas been forgotten. Thus fallen from their high estate, no longer regarded as solemn rites onthe punctual performance of which the welfare and even the life of the community depend,they sink gradually to the level of simple pageants, mummeries, and pastimes, till in the finalstage of degeneration they are wholly abandoned by older people, and, from having oncebeen the most serious occupation of the sage, become at last the idle sport of children. It is inthis final stage of decay that most of the old magical rites of our European forefathers lingeron at the present day, and even from this their last retreat they are fast being swept away byPage 252"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"the rising tide of those multitudinous forces, moral, intellectual, and social, which are bearingmankind onward to a new and unknown goal. We may feel some natural regret at the disap-pearance of quaint customs and picturesque ceremonies, which have preserved to an ageoften deemed dull and prosaic something of the flavour and freshness of the olden time,some breath of the springtime of the world; yet our regret will be lessened when we remem-ber that these pretty pageants, these now innocent diversions, had their origin in ignoranceand superstition; that if they are a record of human endeavour, they are also a monument offruitless ingenuity, of wasted labour, and of blighted hopes; and that for all their gay trap-pings—their flowers, their ribbons, and their music—they partake far more of tragedy than offarce.The interpretation which, following in the footsteps of W. Mannhardt, I have attempted to giveof these ceremonies has been not a little confirmed by the discovery, made since this bookwas first written, that the natives of Central Australia regularly practise magical ceremonies forthe purpose of awakening the dormant energies of nature at the approach of what may becalled the Australian spring. Nowhere apparently are the alternations of the seasons moresudden and the contrasts between them more striking than in the deserts of Central Australia,where at the end of a long period of drought the sandy and stony wilderness, over which thesilence and desolation of death appear to brood, is suddenly, after a few days of torrentialrain, transformed into a landscape smiling with verdure and peopled with teeming multitudesof insects and lizards, of frogs and birds. The marvellous change which passes over the faceof nature at such times has been compared even by European observers to the effect ofmagic; no wonder, then, that the savage should regard it as such in very deed. Now it is justwhen there is promise of the approach of a good season that the natives of Central Australiaare wont especially to perform those magical ceremonies of which the avowed intention is tomultiply the plants and animals they use as food. These ceremonies, therefore, present aclose analogy to the spring customs of our European peasantry not only in the time of theircelebration, but also in their aim; for we can hardly doubt that in instituting rites designed toassist the revival of plant life in spring our primitive forefathers were moved, not by any senti-mental wish to smell at early violets, or pluck the rathe primrose, or watch yellow daffodilsdancing in the breeze, but by the very practical consideration, certainly not formulated inabstract terms, that the life of man is inextricably bound up with that of plants, and that if theywere to perish he could not survive. And as the faith of the Australian savage in the efficacy ofhis magic rites is confirmed by observing that their performance is invariably followed, sooneror later, by that increase of vegetable and animal life which it is their object to produce, so,we may suppose, it was with European savages in the olden time. The sight of the freshgreen in brake and thicket, of vernal flowers blowing on mossy banks, of swallows arrivingfrom the south, and of the sun mounting daily higher in the sky, would be welcomed by themas so many visible signs that their enchantments were indeed taking effect, and would inspirethem with a cheerful confidence that all was well with a world which they could thus mould tosuit their wishes. Only in autumn days, as summer slowly faded, would their confidence againbe dashed by doubts and misgivings at symptoms of decay, which told how vain were all theirefforts to stave off for ever the approach of winter and of death.Chapter XXIXThe Myth of AdonisTHE spectacle of the great changes which annually pass over the face of the earth has pow-erfully impressed the minds of men in all ages, and stirred them to meditate on the causes oftransformations so vast and wonderful. Their curiosity has not been purely disinterested; forPage 253"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"even the savage cannot fail to perceive how intimately his own life is bound up with the life ofnature, and how the same processes which freeze the stream and strip the earth of vegeta-tion menace him with extinction. At a certain stage of development men seem to have imag-ined that the means of averting the threatened calamity were in their own hands, and thatthey could hasten or retard the flight of the seasons by magic art. Accordingly they performedceremonies and recited spells to make the rain to fall, the sun to shine, animals to multiply,and the fruits of the earth to grow. In course of time the slow advance of knowledge, whichhas dispelled so many cherished illusions, convinced at least the more thoughtful portion ofmankind that the alternations of summer and winter, of spring and autumn, were not merelythe result of their own magical rites, but that some deeper cause, some mightier power, wasat work behind the shifting scenes of nature. They now pictured to themselves the growth anddecay of vegetation, the birth and death of living creatures, as effects of the waxing or waningstrength of divine beings, of gods and goddesses, who were born and died, who married andbegot children, on the pattern of human life.Thus the old magical theory of the seasons was displaced, or rather supplemented, by a reli-gious theory. For although men now attributed the annual cycle of change primarily to corre-sponding changes in their deities, they still thought that by performing certain magical ritesthey could aid the god who was the principle of life, in his struggle with the opposing principleof death. They imagined that they could recruit his failing energies and even raise him fromthe dead. The ceremonies which they observed for this purpose were in substance a dramaticrepresentation of the natural processes which they wished to facilitate; for it is a familiar tenetof magic that you can produce any desired effect by merely imitating it. And as they nowexplained the fluctuations of growth and decay, of reproduction and dissolution, by the mar-riage, the death, and the rebirth or revival of the gods, their religious or rather magical dra-mas turned in great measure on these themes. They set forth the fruitful union of the powersof fertility, the sad death of one at least of the divine partners, and his joyful resurrection.Thus a religious theory was blended with a magical practice. The combination is familiar inhistory. Indeed, few religions have ever succeeded in wholly extricating themselves from theold trammels of magic. The inconsistency of acting on two opposite principles, however it mayvex the soul of the philosopher, rarely troubles the common man; indeed he is seldom evenaware of it. His affair is to act, not to analyse the motives of his action. If mankind had alwaysbeen logical and wise, history would not be a long chronicle of folly and crime.Of the changes which the seasons bring with them, the most striking within the temperatezone are those which affect vegetation. The influence of the seasons on animals, thoughgreat, is not nearly so manifest. Hence it is natural that in the magical dramas designed todispel winter and bring back spring the emphasis should be laid on vegetation, and that treesand plants should figure in them more prominently than beasts and birds. Yet the two sidesof life, the vegetable and the animal, were not dissociated in the minds of those whoobserved the ceremonies. Indeed they commonly believed that the tie between the animaland the vegetable world was even closer than it really is; hence they often combined the dra-matic representation of reviving plants with a real or a dramatic union of the sexes for the pur-pose of furthering at the same time and by the same act the multiplication of fruits, of ani-mals, and of men. To them the principle of life and fertility, whether animal or vegetable, wasone and indivisible. To live and to cause to live, to eat food and to beget children, these werethe primary wants of men in the past, and they will be the primary wants of men in the futureso long as the world lasts. Other things may be added to enrich and beautify human life, butunless these wants are first satisfied, humanity itself must cease to exist. These two things,therefore, food and children, were what men chiefly sought to procure by the performance ofPage 254"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"magical rites for the regulation of the seasons.Nowhere, apparently, have these rites been more widely and solemnly celebrated than in thelands which border the Eastern Mediterranean. Under the names of Osiris, Tammuz, Adonis,and Attis, the peoples of Egypt and Western Asia represented the yearly decay and revival oflife, especially of vegetable life, which they personified as a god who annually died and roseagain from the dead. In name and detail the rites varied from place to place: in substancethey were the same. The supposed death and resurrection of this oriental deity, a god ofmany names but of essentially one nature, is now to be examined. We begin with Tammuz orAdonis.The worship of Adonis was practised by the Semitic peoples of Babylonia and Syria, and theGreeks borrowed it from them as early as the seventh century before Christ. The true nameof the deity was Tammuz: the appellation of Adonis is merely the Semitic Adon, “lord,” a titleof honour by which his worshippers addressed him. But the Greeks through a misunderstand-ing converted the title of honour into a proper name. In the religious literature of BabyloniaTammuz appears as the youthful spouse or lover of Ishtar, the great mother goddess, theembodiment of the reproductive energies of nature. The references to their connexion witheach other in myth and ritual are both fragmentary and obscure, but we gather from them thatevery year Tammuz was believed to die, passing away from the cheerful earth to the gloomysubterranean world, and that every year his divine mistress journeyed in quest of him “to theland from which there is no returning, to the house of darkness, where dust lies on door andbolt.” During her absence the passion of love ceased to operate: men and beasts alike forgotto reproduce their kinds: all life was threatened with extinction. So intimately bound up withthe goddess were the sexual functions of the whole animal kingdom that without her pres-ence they could not be discharged. A messenger of the great god Ea was accordinglydespatched to rescue the goddess on whom so much depended. The stern queen of theinfernal regions, Allatu or Eresh-Kigal by name, reluctantly allowed Ishtar to be sprinkled withthe Water of Life and to depart, in company probably with her lover Tammuz, that the twomight return together to the upper world, and that with their return all nature might revive.Laments for the departed Tammuz are contained in several Babylonian hymns, which likenhim to plants that quickly fade. He is “A tamarisk that in the garden has drunk no water, Whose crown in the field has brought forth no blossom. Awillow that rejoiced not by the watercourse, Awillow whose roots were torn up. Aherb that in the garden had drunk no water.” His death appears to have been annually mourned, to the shrill music of flutes, by men andwomen about midsummer in the month named after him, the month of Tammuz. The dirgeswere seemingly chanted over an effigy of the dead god, which was washed with pure water,anointed with oil, and clad in a red robe, while the fumes of incense rose into the air, as if tostir his dormant senses by their pungent fragrance and wake him from the sleep of death. Inone of these dirges, inscribed Lament of the Flutes for Tammuz, we seem still to hear thevoices of the singers chanting the sad refrain and to catch, like far-away music, the wailingnotes of the flutes: “At his vanishing away she lifts up a lament, Page 255"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"‘Oh my child!’ at his vanishing away she lifts up a lament; ‘My Damu!’ at his vanishing away she lifts up a lament. ‘My enchanter and priest!’ at his vanishing away she lifts up a lament, At the shining cedar, rooted in a spacious place, In Eanna, above and below, she lifts up a lament. Like the lament that a house lifts up for its master, lifts she up a lament, Like the lament that a city lifts up for its lord, lifts she up a lament. Her lament is the lament for a herb that grows not in the bed, Her lament is the lament for the corn that grows not in the ear. Her chamber is a possession that brings not forth a possession, Aweary woman, a weary child, forspent. Her lament is for a great river, where no willows grow, Her lament is for a field, where corn and herbs grow not. Her lament is for a pool, where fishes grow not. Her lament is for a thickest of reeds, where no reeds grow. Her lament is for woods, where tamarisks grow not. Her lament is for a wilderness where no cypresses (?) grow. Her lament is for the depth of a garden of trees, where honey and wine grow not. Her lament is for meadows, where no plants grow. Her lament is for a palace, where length of life grows not.”The tragical story and the melancholy rites of Adonis are better known to us from the descrip-tions of Greek writers than from the fragments of Babylonian literature or the brief referenceof the prophet Ezekiel, who saw the women of Jerusalem weeping for Tammuz at the northgate of the temple. Mirrored in the glass of Greek mythology, the oriental deity appears as acomely youth beloved by Aphrodite. In his infancy the goddess hid him in a chest, which shegave in charge to Persephone, queen of the nether world. But when Persephone opened thechest and beheld the beauty of the babe, she refused to give him back to Aphrodite, thoughthe goddess of love went down herself to hell to ransom her dear one from the power of thegrave. The dispute between the two goddesses of love and death was settled by Zeus, whodecreed that Adonis should abide with Persephone in the under world for one part of the year,and with Aphrodite in the upper world for another part. At last the fair youth was killed in hunt-ing by a wild boar, or by the jealous Ares, who turned himself into the likeness of a boar inorder to compass the death of his rival. Bitterly did Aphrodite lament her loved and lostAdonis. In this form of the myth, the contest between Aphrodite and Persephone for the pos-session of Adonis clearly reflects the struggle between Ishtar and Allatu in the land of thedead, while the decision of Zeus that Adonis is to spend one part of the year under groundand another part above ground is merely a Greek version of the annual disappearance andreappearance of Tammuz.Chapter XXXAdonis in SyriaTHE myth of Adonis was localised and his rites celebrated with much solemnity at two placesin Western Asia. One of these was Byblus on the coast of Syria, the other was Paphos inCyprus. Both were great seats of the worship of Aphrodite, or rather of her Semitic counter-part, Astarte; and of both, if we accept the legends, Cinyras, the father of Adonis, was king.Of the two cities Byblus was the more ancient; indeed it claimed to be the oldest city inPhoenicia, and to have been founded in the early ages of the world by the great god El,whom Greeks and Romans identified with Cronus and Saturn respectively. However that mayPage 256"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"have been, in historical times it ranked as a holy place, the religious capital of the country, theMecca or Jerusalem of the Phoenicians. The city stood on a height beside the sea, and con-tained a great sanctuary of Astarte, where in the midst of a spacious open court, surroundedby cloisters and approached from below by staircases, rose a tall cone or obelisk, the holyimage of the goddess. In this sanctuary the rites of Adonis were celebrated. Indeed the wholecity was sacred to him, and the river Nahr Ibrahim, which falls into the sea a little to the southof Byblus, bore in antiquity the name of Adonis. This was the kingdom of Cinyras. From theearliest to the latest times the city appears to have been ruled by kings, assisted perhaps bya senate or council of elders.The last king of Byblus bore the ancient name of Cinyras, and was beheaded by Pompey theGreat for his tyrannous excesses. His legendary namesake Cinyras is said to have founded asanctuary of Aphrodite, that is, of Astarte, at a place on Mount Lebanon, distant a day’s jour-ney from the capital. The spot was probably Aphaca, at the source of the river Adonis, half-way between Byblus and Baalbec; for at Aphaca there was a famous grove and sanctuary ofAstarte which Constantine destroyed on account of the flagitious character of the worship.The site of the temple has been discovered by modern travellers near the miserable villagewhich still bears the name of Afka at the head of the wild, romantic, wooded gorge of theAdonis. The hamlet stands among groves of noble walnut-trees on the brink of the lyn. A littleway off the river rushes from a cavern at the foot of a mighty amphitheatre of towering cliffs toplunge in a series of cascades into the awful depths of the glen. The deeper it descends, theranker and denser grows the vegetation, which, sprouting from the crannies and fissures ofthe rocks, spreads a green veil over the roaring or murmuring stream in the tremendouschasm below. There is something delicious, almost intoxicating, in the freshness of thesetumbling waters, in the sweetness and purity of the mountain air, in the vivid green of the veg-etation. The temple, of which some massive hewn blocks and a fine column of Syenite gran-ite still mark the site, occupied a terrace facing the source of the river and commanding amagnificent prospect. Across the foam and the roar of the waterfalls you look up to the cavernand away to the top of the sublime precipices above. So lofty is the cliff that the goats whichcreep along its ledges to browse on the bushes appear like ants to the spectator hundreds offeet below. Seaward the view is especially impressive when the sun floods the profoundgorge with golden light, revealing all the fantastic buttresses and rounded towers of its moun-tain rampart, and falling softly on the varied green of the woods which clothe its depths. Itwas here that, according to the legend, Adonis met Aphrodite for the first or the last time, andhere his mangled body was buried. A fairer scene could hardly be imagined for a story oftragic love and death.Yet, sequestered as the valley is and must always have been, it is not wholly deserted. A con-vent or a village may be observed here and there standing out against the sky on the top ofsome beetling crag, or clinging to the face of a nearly perpendicular cliff high above the foamand the din of the river; and at evening the lights that twinkle through the gloom betray thepresence of human habitations on slopes which might seem inaccessible to man. In antiquitythe whole of the lovely vale appears to have been dedicated to Adonis, and to this day it ishaunted by his memory; for the heights which shut it in are crested at various points by ruinedmonuments of his worship, some of them overhanging dreadful abysses, down which it turnsthe head dizzy to look and see the eagles wheeling about their nests far below. One suchmonument exists at Ghineh. The face of a great rock, above a roughly hewn recess, is herecarved with figures of Adonis and Aphrodite. He is portrayed with spear in rest, awaiting theattack of a bear, while she is seated in an attitude of sorrow. Her grief-stricken figure may wellbe the mourning Aphrodite of the Lebanon described by Macrobius, and the recess in therock is perhaps her lover’s tomb. Every year, in the belief of his worshippers, Adonis wasPage 257"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"wounded to death on the mountains, and every year the face of nature itself was dyed withhis sacred blood. So year by year the Syrian damsels lamented his untimely fate, while thered anemone, his flower, bloomed among the cedars of Lebanon, and the river ran red to thesea, fringing the winding shores of the blue Mediterranean, whenever the wind set inshore,with a sinuous band of crimson.Chapter XXXIAdonis in CyprusTHE island of Cyprus lies but one day’s sail from the coast of Syria. Indeed, on fine summerevenings its mountains may be descried looming low and dark against the red fires of sunset.With its rich mines of copper and its forests of firs and stately cedars, the island naturallyattracted a commercial and maritime people like the Phoenicians; while the abundance of itscorn, its wine, and its oil must have rendered it in their eyes a Land of Promise by compari-son with the niggardly nature of their own rugged coast, hemmed in between the mountainsand the sea. Accordingly they settled in Cyprus at a very early date and remained there longafter the Greeks had also established themselves on its shores; for we know from inscriptionsand coins that Phoenician kings reigned at Citium, the Chittim of the Hebrews, down to thetime of Alexander the Great. Naturally the Semitic colonists brought their gods with them fromthe mother-land. They worshipped Baal of the Lebanon, who may well have been Adonis, andat Amathus on the south coast they instituted the rites of Adonis and Aphrodite, or ratherAstarte. Here, as at Byblus, these rites resembled the Egyptian worship of Osiris so closelythat some people even identified the Adonis of Amathus with Osiris.But the great seat of the worship of Aphrodite and Adonis in Cyprus was Paphos on thesouth-western side of the island. Among the petty kingdoms into which Cyprus was dividedfrom the earliest times until the end of the fourth century before our era Paphos must haveranked with the best. It is a land of hills and billowy ridges, diversified by fields and vineyardsand intersected by rivers, which in the course of ages have carved for themselves beds ofsuch tremendous depth that travelling in the interior is difficult and tedious. The lofty range ofMount Olympus (the modern Troodos), capped with snow the greater part of the year,screens Paphos from the northerly and easterly winds and cuts it off from the rest of theisland. On the slopes of the range the last pine-woods of Cyprus linger, sheltering here andthere monasteries in scenery not unworthy of the Apennines. The old city of Paphos occupiedthe summit of a hill about a mile from the sea; the newer city sprang up at the harbour someten miles off. The sanctuary of Aphrodite at Old Paphos (the modern Kuklia) was one of themost celebrated shrines in the ancient world. According to Herodotus, it was founded byPhoenician colonists from Ascalon; but it is possible that a native goddess of fertility was wor-shipped on the spot before the arrival of the Phoenicians, and that the newcomers identifiedher with their own Baalath or Astarte, whom she may have closely resembled. If two deitieswere thus fused in one, we may suppose that they were both varieties of that great goddessof motherhood and fertility whose worship appears to have been spread all over Western Asiafrom a very early time. The supposition is confirmed as well by the archaic shape of herimage as by the licentious character of her rites; for both that shape and those rites wereshared by her with other Asiatic deities. Her image was simply a white cone or pyramid. Inlike manner, a cone was the emblem of Astarte at Byblus, of the native goddess whom theGreeks called Artemis at Perga in Pamphylia, and of the sun-god Heliogabalus at Emesa inSyria. Conical stones, which apparently served as idols, have also been found at Golgi inCyprus, and in the Phoenician temples of Malta; and cones of sandstone came to light at theshrine of the “Mistress of Torquoise” among the barren hills and frowning precipices of Sinai.Page 258"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"In Cyprus it appears that before marriage all women were formerly obliged by custom to pros-titute themselves to strangers at the sanctuary of the goddess, whether she went by thename of Aphrodite, Astarte, or what not. Similar customs prevailed in many parts of WesternAsia. Whatever its motive, the practice was clearly regarded, not as an orgy of lust, but as asolemn religious duty performed in the service of that great Mother Goddess of Western Asiawhose name varied, while her type remained constant, from place to place. Thus at Babylonevery woman, whether rich or poor, had once in her life to submit to the embraces of astranger at the temple of Mylitta, that is, of Ishtar or Astarte, and to dedicate to the goddessthe wages earned by this sanctified harlotry. The sacred precinct was crowded with womenwaiting to observe the custom. Some of them had to wait there for years. At Heliopolis orBaalbec in Syria, famous for the imposing grandeur of its ruined temples, the custom of thecountry required that every maiden should prostitute herself to a stranger at the temple ofAstarte, and matrons as well as maids testified their devotion to the goddess in the samemanner. The emperor Constantine abolished the custom, destroyed the temple, and built achurch in its stead. In Phoenician temples women prostituted themselves for hire in the serv-ice of religion, believing that by this conduct they propitiated the goddess and won her favour.“It was a law of the Amorites, that she who was about to marry should sit in fornication sevendays by the gate.” At Byblus the people shaved their heads in the annual mourning forAdonis. Women who refused to sacrifice their hair had to give themselves up to strangers ona certain day of the festival, and the money which they thus earned was devoted to the god-dess. A Greek inscription found at Tralles in Lydia proves that the practice of religious prosti-tution survived in that country as late as the second century of our era. It records of a certainwoman, Aurelia Aemilia by name, not only that she herself served the god in the capacity of aharlot at his express command, but that her mother and other female ancestors had done thesame before her; and the publicity of the record, engraved on a marble column which sup-ported a votive offering, shows that no stain attached to such a life and such a parentage. InArmenia the noblest families dedicated their daughters to the service of the goddess Anaitisin her temple of Acilisena, where the damsels acted as prostitutes for a long time before theywere given in marriage. Nobody scrupled to take one of these girls to wife when her period ofservice was over. Again, the goddess Ma was served by a multitude of sacred harlots atComana in Pontus, and crowds of men and women flocked to her sanctuary from the neigh-bouring cities and country to attend the biennial festivals or to pay their vows to the goddess.If we survey the whole of the evidence on this subject, some of which has still to be laidbefore the reader, we may conclude that a great Mother Goddess, the personification of allthe reproductive energies of nature, was worshipped under different names but with a sub-stantial similarity of myth and ritual by many peoples of Western Asia; that associated withher was a lover, or rather series of lovers, divine yet mortal, with whom she mated year byyear, their commerce being deemed essential to the propagation of animals and plants, eachin their several kind; and further, that the fabulous union of the divine pair was simulated and,as it were, multiplied on earth by the real, though temporary, union of the human sexes at thesanctuary of the goddess for the sake of thereby ensuring the fruitfulness of the ground andthe increase of man and beast.At Paphos the custom of religious prostitution is said to have been instituted by King Cinyras,and to have been practised by his daughters, the sisters of Adonis, who, having incurred thewrath of Aphrodite, mated with strangers and ended their days in Egypt. In this form of thetradition the wrath of Aphrodite is probably a feature added by a later authority, who couldonly regard conduct which shocked his own moral sense as a punishment inflicted by thePage 259"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"goddess instead of as a sacrifice regularly enjoined by her on all her devotees. At all eventsthe story indicates that the princesses of Paphos had to conform to the custom as well aswomen of humble birth.Among the stories which were told of Cinyras, the ancestor of the priestly kings of Paphosand the father of Adonis, there are some that deserve our attention. In the first place, he issaid to have begotten his son Adonis in incestuous intercourse with his daughter Myrrha at afestival of the corn-goddess, at which women robed in white were wont to offer corn-wreathsas first-fruits of the harvest and to observe strict chastity for nine days. Similar cases of incestwith a daughter are reported of many ancient kings. It seems unlikely that such reports arewithout foundation, and perhaps equally improbable that they refer to mere fortuitous out-bursts of unnatural lust. We may suspect that they are based on a practice actually observedfor a definite reason in certain special circumstances. Now in countries where the royal bloodwas traced through women only, and where consequently the king held office merely in virtueof his marriage with an hereditary princess, who was the real sovereign, it appears to haveoften happened that a prince married his own sister, the princess royal, in order to obtain withher hand the crown which otherwise would have gone to another man, perhaps to a stranger.May not the same rule of descent have furnished a motive for incest with a daughter? For itseems a natural corollary from such a rule that the king was bound to vacate the throne onthe death of his wife, the queen, since he occupied it only by virtue of his marriage with her.When that marriage terminated, his right to the throne terminated with it and passed at onceto his daughter’s husband. Hence if the king desired to reign after his wife’s death, the onlyway in which he could legitimately continue to do so was by marrying his daughter, and thusprolonging through her the title which had formerly been his through her mother.Cinyras is said to have been famed for his exquisite beauty and to have been wooed byAphrodite herself. Thus it would appear, as scholars have already observed, that Cinyras wasin a sense a duplicate of his handsome son Adonis, to whom the inflammable goddess alsolost her heart. Further, these stories of the love of Aphrodite for two members of the royalhouse of Paphos can hardly be dissociated from the corresponding legend told of Pygmalion,a Phoenician king of Cyprus, who is said to have fallen in love with an image of Aphroditeand taken it to his bed. When we consider that Pygmalion was the father-in-law of Cinyras,that the son of Cinyras was Adonis, and that all three, in successive generations, are said tohave been concerned in a love-intrigue with Aphrodite, we can hardly help concluding that theearly Phoenician kings of Paphos, or their sons, regularly claimed to be not merely the priestsof the goddess but also her lovers, in other words, that in their official capacity they personat-ed Adonis. At all events Adonis is said to have reigned in Cyprus, and it appears to be certainthat the title of Adonis was regularly borne by the sons of all the Phoenician kings of theisland. It is true that the title strictly signified no more than “lord”; yet the legends which con-nect these Cyprian princes with the goddess of love make it probable that they claimed thedivine nature as well as the human dignity of Adonis. The story of Pygmalion points to a cere-mony of a sacred marriage in which the king wedded the image of Aphrodite, or rather ofAstarte. If that was so, the tale was in a sense true, not of a single man only, but of a wholeseries of men, and it would be all the more likely to be told of Pygmalion, if that was a com-mon name of Semitic kings in general, and of Cyprian kings in particular. Pygmalion, at allevents, is known as the name of the king of Tyre from whom his sister Dido fled; and a kingof Citium and Idalium in Cyprus, who reigned in the time of Alexander the Great, was alsocalled Pygmalion, or rather Pumiyathon, the Phoenician name which the Greeks corruptedinto Pygmalion. Further, it deserves to be noted that the names Pygmalion and Astarte occurtogether in a Punic inscription on a gold medallion which was found in a grave at Carthage;Page 260"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"the characters of the inscription are of the earliest type. As the custom of religious prostitutionat Paphos is said to have been founded by king Cinyras and observed by his daughters, wemay surmise that the kings of Paphos played the part of the divine bridegroom in a less inno-cent rite than the form of marriage with a statue; in fact, that at certain festivals each of themhad to mate with one or more of the sacred harlots of the temple, who played Astarte to hisAdonis. If that was so, there is more truth than has commonly been supposed in the reproachcast by the Christian fathers that the Aphrodite worshipped by Cinyras was a common whore.The fruit of their union would rank as sons and daughters of the deity, and would in timebecome the parents of gods and goddesses, like their fathers and mothers before them. Inthis manner Paphos, and perhaps all sanctuaries of the great Asiatic goddess where sacredprostitution was practised, might be well stocked with human deities, the offspring of thedivine king by his wives, concubines, and temple harlots. Any one of these might probablysucceed his father on the throne or be sacrificed in his stead whenever stress of war or othergrave junctures called, as they sometimes did, for the death of a royal victim. Such a tax,levied occasionally on the king’s numerous progeny for the good of the country, would neitherextinguish the divine stock nor break the father’s heart, who divided his paternal affectionamong so many. At all events, if, as there seems reason to believe, Semitic kings were oftenregarded at the same time as hereditary deities, it is easy to understand the frequency ofSemitic personal names which imply that the bearers of them were the sons or daughters, thebrothers or sisters, the fathers or mothers of a god, and we need not resort to the shiftsemployed by some scholars to evade the plain sense of the words. This interpretation is con-firmed by a parallel Egyptian usage; for in Egypt, where the kings were worshipped as divine,the queen was called “the wife of the god” or “the mother of the god,” and the title “father ofthe god” was borne not only by the king’s real father but also by his father-in-law. Similarly,perhaps, among the Semites any man who sent his daughter to swell the royal harem mayhave been allowed to call himself “the father of the god.”If we may judge by his name, the Semitic king who bore the name of Cinyras was, like KingDavid, a harper; for the name of Cinyras is clearly connected with the Greek cinyra, “a lyre,”which in its turn comes from the Semitic kinnor, “a lyre,” the very word applied to the instru-ment on which David played before Saul. We shall probably not err in assuming that atPaphos as at Jerusalem the music of the lyre or harp was not a mere pastime designed towhile away an idle hour, but formed part of the service of religion, the moving influence of itsmelodies being perhaps set down, like the effect of wine, to the direct inspiration of a deity.Certainly at Jerusalem the regular clergy of the temple prophesied to the music of harps, ofpsalteries, and of cymbals; and it appears that the irregular clergy also, as we may call theprophets, depended on some such stimulus for inducing the ecstatic state which they took forimmediate converse with the divinity. Thus we read of a band of prophets coming down froma high place with a psaltery, a timbrel, a pipe, and a harp before them, and prophesying asthey went. Again, when the united forces of Judah and Ephraim were traversing the wilder-ness of Moab in pursuit of the enemy, they could find no water for three days, and were liketo die of thirst, they and the beasts of burden. In this emergency the prophet Elisha, who waswith the army, called for a minstrel and bade him play. Under the influence of the music heordered the soldiers to dig trenches in the sandy bed of the waterless waddy through whichlay the line of march. They did so, and next morning the trenches were full of the water thathad drained down into them underground from the desolate, forbidding mountains on eitherhand. The prophet’s success in striking water in the wilderness resembles the reported suc-cess of modern dowsers, though his mode of procedure was different. Incidentally he ren-dered another service to his countrymen. For the skulking Moabites from their lairs among therocks saw the red sun of the desert reflected in the water, and taking it for the blood, or per-Page 261"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"haps rather for an omen of the blood, of their enemies, they plucked up heart to attack thecamp and were defeated with great slaughter.Again, just as the cloud of melancholy which from time to time darkened the moody mind ofSaul was viewed as an evil spirit from the Lord vexing him, so on the other hand the solemnstrains of the harp, which soothed and composed his troubled thoughts, may well haveseemed to the hag-ridden king the very voice of God or of his good angel whispering peace.Even in our own day a great religious writer, himself deeply sensitive to the witchery of music,has said that musical notes, with all their power to fire the blood and melt the heart, cannotbe mere empty sounds and nothing more; no, they have escaped from some higher sphere,they are outpourings of eternal harmony, the voice of angels, the Magnificat of saints. It isthus that the rude imaginings of primitive man are transfigured and his feeble lispings echoedwith a rolling reverberation in the musical prose of Newman. Indeed the influence of music onthe development of religion is a subject which would repay a sympathetic study. For we can-not doubt that this, the most intimate and affecting of all the arts, has done much to create aswell as to express the religious emotions, thus modifying more or less deeply the fabric ofbelief to which at first sight it seems only to minister. The musician has done his part as wellas the prophet and the thinker in the making of religion. Every faith has its appropriate music,and the difference between the creeds might almost be expressed in musical notation. Theinterval, for example, which divides the wild revels of Cybele from the stately ritual of theCatholic Church is measured by the gulf which severs the dissonant clash of cymbals andtambourines from the grave harmonies of Palestrina and Handel. A different spirit breathes inthe difference of the music.Chapter XXXIIThe Ritual of AdonisATthe festivals of Adonis, which were held in Western Asia and in Greek lands, the death ofthe god was annually mourned, with a bitter wailing, chiefly by women; images of him,dressed to resemble corpses, were carried out as to burial and then thrown into the sea orinto springs; and in some places his revival was celebrated on the following day. But at differ-ent places the ceremonies varied somewhat in the manner and apparently also in the seasonof their celebration. At Alexandria images of Aphrodite and Adonis were displayed on twocouches; beside them were set ripe fruits of all kinds, cakes, plants growing in flower-pots,and green bowers twined with anise. The marriage of the lovers was celebrated one day, andon the morrow women attired as mourners, with streaming hair and bared breasts, bore theimage of the dead Adonis to the sea-shore and committed it to the waves. Yet they sorrowednot without hope, for they sang that the lost one would come back again. The date at whichthis Alexandrian ceremony was observed is not expressly stated; but from the mention of theripe fruits it has been inferred that it took place in late summer. In the great Phoenician sanc-tuary of Astarte at Byblus the death of Adonis was annually mourned, to the shrill wailingnotes of the flute, with weeping, lamentation, and beating of the breast; but next day he wasbelieved to come to life again and ascend up to heaven in the presence of his worshippers.The disconsolate believers, left behind on earth, shaved their heads as the Egyptians did onthe death of the divine bull Apis; women who could not bring themselves to sacrifice theirbeautiful tresses had to give themselves up to strangers on a certain day of the festival, andto dedicate to Astarte the wages of their shame.This Phoenician festival appears to have been a vernal one, for its date was determined bythe discoloration of the river Adonis, and this has been observed by modern travellers toPage 262"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"occur in spring. At that season the red earth washed down from the mountains by the raintinges the water of the river, and even the sea, for a great way with a blood-red hue, and thecrimson stain was believed to be the blood of Adonis, annually wounded to death by the boaron Mount Lebanon. Again, the scarlet anemone is said to have sprung from the blood ofAdonis, or to have been stained by it; and as the anemone blooms in Syria about Easter, thismay be thought to show that the festival of Adonis, or at least one of his festivals, was held inspring. The name of the flower is probably derived from Naaman (“darling”), which seems tohave been an epithet of Adonis. The Arabs still call the anemone “wounds of the Naaman.”The red rose also was said to owe its hue to the same sad occasion; for Aphrodite, hasteningto her wounded lover, trod on a bush of white roses; the cruel thorns tore her tender flesh,and her sacred blood dyed the white roses for ever red. It would be idle, perhaps, to lay muchweight on evidence drawn from the calendar of flowers, and in particular to press an argu-ment so fragile as the bloom of the rose. Yet so far as it counts at all, the tale which links thedamask rose with the death of Adonis points to a summer rather than to a spring celebrationof his passion. In Attica, certainly, the festival fell at the height of summer. For the fleet whichAthens fitted out against Syracuse, and by the destruction of which her power was perma-nently crippled, sailed at midsummer, and by an ominous coincidence the sombre rites ofAdonis were being celebrated at the very time. As the troops marched down to the harbour toembark, the streets through which they passed were lined with coffins and corpse-like effi-gies, and the air was rent with the noise of women wailing for the dead Adonis. The circum-stance cast a gloom over the sailing of the most splendid armament that Athens ever sent tosea. Many ages afterwards, when the Emperor Julian made his first entry into Antioch, hefound in like manner the gay, the luxurious capital of the East plunged in mimic grief for theannual death of Adonis; and if he had any presentiment of coming evil, the voices of lamenta-tion which struck upon his ear must have seemed to sound his knell.The resemblance of these ceremonies to the Indian and European ceremonies which I havedescribed elsewhere is obvious. In particular, apart from the somewhat doubtful date of itscelebration, the Alexandrian ceremony is almost identical with the Indian. In both of them themarriage of two divine beings, whose affinity with vegetation seems indicated by the freshplants with which they are surrounded, is celebrated in effigy, and the effigies are afterwardsmourned over and thrown into the water. From the similarity of these customs to each otherand to the spring and midsummer customs of modern Europe we should naturally expect thatthey all admit of a common explanation. Hence, if the explanation which I have adopted ofthe latter is correct, the ceremony of the death and resurrection of Adonis must also havebeen a dramatic representation of the decay and revival of plant life. The inference thusbased on the resemblance of the customs is confirmed by the following features in the legendand ritual of Adonis. His affinity with vegetation comes out at once in the common story of hisbirth. He was said to have been born from a myrrh-tree, the bark of which bursting, after a tenmonths’ gestation, allowed the lovely infant to come forth. According to some, a boar rent thebark with his tusk and so opened a passage for the babe. A faint rationalistic colour was givento the legend by saying that his mother was a woman named Myrrh, who had been turnedinto a myrrh-tree soon after she had conceived the child. The use of myrrh as incense at thefestival of Adonis may have given rise to the fable. We have seen that incense was burnt atthe corresponding Babylonian rites, just as it was burnt by the idolatrous Hebrews in honourof the Queen of Heaven, who was no other than Astarte. Again, the story that Adonis spenthalf, or according to others a third, of the year in the lower world and the rest of it in the upperworld, is explained most simply and naturally by supposing that he represented vegetation,especially the corn, which lies buried in the earth half the year and reappears above groundthe other half. Certainly of the annual phenomena of nature there is none which suggests soPage 263"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"obviously the idea of death and resurrection as the disappearance and reappearance of veg-etation in autumn and spring. Adonis has been taken for the sun; but there is nothing in thesun’s annual course within the temperate and tropical zones to suggest that he is dead forhalf or a third of the year and alive for the other half or two-thirds. He might, indeed, be con-ceived as weakened in winter, but dead he could not be thought to be; his daily reappearancecontradicts the supposition. Within the Arctic Circle, where the sun annually disappears for acontinuous period which varies from twenty-four hours to six months according to the latitude,his yearly death and resurrection would certainly be an obvious idea; but no one except theunfortunate astronomer Bailly has maintained that the Adonis worship came from the Arcticregions. On the other hand, the annual death and revival of vegetation is a conception whichreadily presents itself to men in every stage of savagery and civilisation; and the vastness ofthe scale on which this ever-recurring decay and regeneration takes place, together withman’s intimate dependence on it for subsistence, combine to render it the most impressiveannual occurrence in nature, at least within the temperate zones. It is no wonder that a phe-nomenon so important, so striking, and so universal should, by suggesting similar ideas, havegiven rise to similar rites in many lands. We may, therefore, accept as probable an explana-tion of the Adonis worship which accords so well with the facts of nature and with the analogyof similar rites in other lands. Moreover, the explanation is countenanced by a considerablebody of opinion amongst the ancients themselves, who again and again interpreted the dyingand reviving god as the reaped and sprouting grain.The character of Tammuz or Adonis as a corn-spirit comes out plainly in an account of hisfestival given by an Arabic writer of the tenth century. In describing the rites and sacrificesobserved at the different seasons of the year by the heathen Syrians of Harran, he says:“Tammuz (July). In the middle of this month is the festival of el-Bûgât, that is, of the weepingwomen, and this is the Tâ-uz festival, which is celebrated in honour of the god Tâ-uz. Thewomen bewail him, because his lord slew him so cruelly, ground his bones in a mill, and thenscattered them to the wind. The women (during this festival) eat nothing which has beenground in a mill, but limit their diet to steeped wheat, sweet vetches, dates, raisins, and thelike.” Tâ-uz, who is no other than Tammuz, is here like Burns’s John Barleycorn: “They wasted o’er a scorching flame The marrow of his bones; But a miller us’d him worst of all— For he crush’d him between two stones.”This concentration, so to say, of the nature of Adonis upon the cereal crops is characteristic ofthe stage of culture reached by his worshippers in historical times. They had left the nomadiclife of the wandering hunter and herdsman far behind them; for ages they had been settled onthe land, and had depended for their subsistence mainly on the products of tillage. Theberries and roots of the wilderness, the grass of the pastures, which had been matters of vitalimportance to their ruder forefathers, were now of little moment to them: more and more theirthoughts and energies were engrossed by the staple of their life, the corn; more and moreaccordingly the propitiation of the deities of fertility in general and of the corn-spirit in particu-lar tended to become the central feature of their religion. The aim they set before themselvesin celebrating the rites was thoroughly practical. It was no vague poetical sentiment whichprompted them to hail with joy the rebirth of vegetation and to mourn its decline. Hunger, feltor feared, was the mainspring of the worship of Adonis.It has been suggested by Father Lagrange that the mourning for Adonis was essentially aPage 264"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"harvest rite designed to propitiate the corngod, who was then either perishing under the sick-les of the reapers, or being trodden to death under the hoofs of the oxen on the threshing-floor. While the menslew him, the women wept crocodile tears at home to appease his natural indignation by ashow of grief for his death. The theory fits in well with the dates of the festivals, which fell inspring or summer; for spring and summer, not autumn, are the seasons of the barley andwheat harvests in the lands which worshipped Adonis. Further, the hypothesis is confirmed bythe practice of the Egyptian reapers, who lamented, calling upon Isis, when they cut the firstcorn; and it is recommended by the analogous customs of many hunting tribes, who testifygreat respect for the animals which they kill and eat.Thus interpreted the death of Adonis is not the natural decay of vegetation in general underthe summer heat or the winter cold; it is the violent destruction of the corn by man, who cuts itdown on the field, stamps it to pieces on the threshing-floor, and grinds it to powder in themill. That this was indeed the principal aspect in which Adonis presented himself in later timesto the agricultural peoples of the Levant, may be admitted; but whether from the beginning hehad been the corn and nothing but the corn, may be doubted. At an earlier period he mayhave been to the herdsman, above all, the tender herbage which sprouts after rain, offeringrich pasture to the lean and hungry cattle. Earlier still he may have embodied the spirit of thenuts and berries which the autumn woods yield to the savage hunter and his squaw. And justas the husband-man must propitiate the spirit of the corn which he consumes, so the herds-man must appease the spirit of the grass and leaves which his cattle munch, and the huntermust soothe the spirit of the roots which he digs, and of the fruits which he gathers from thebough. In all cases the propitiation of the injured and angry, sprite would naturally compriseelaborate excuses and apologies, accompanied by loud lamentations at his decease whenev-er, through some deplorable accident or necessity, he happened to be murdered as well asrobbed. Only we must bear in mind that the savage hunter and herdsman of those early dayshad probably not yet attained to the abstract idea of vegetation in general; and that accord-ingly, so far as Adonis existed for them at all, he must have been the Adon or lord of eachindividual tree and plant rather than a personification of vegetable life as a whole. Thus therewould be as many Adonises as there were trees and shrubs, and each of them might expectto receive satisfaction for any damage done to his person or property. And year by year, whenthe trees were deciduous, every Adonis would seem to bleed to death with the red leaves ofautumn and to come to life again with the fresh green of spring.There is some reason to think that in early times Adonis was sometimes personated by a liv-ing man who died a violent death in the character of the god. Further, there is evidence whichgoes to show that among the agricultural peoples of the Eastern Mediterranean, the corn-spir-it, by whatever name he was known, was often represented, year by year, by human victimsslain on the harvest-field. If that was so, it seems likely that the propitiation of the corn-spiritwould tend to fuse to some extent with the worship of the dead. For the spirits of these vic-tims might be thought to return to life in the ears which they had fattened with their blood, andto die a second death at the reaping of the corn. Now the ghosts of those who have perishedby violence are surly and apt to wreak their vengeance on their slayers whenever an opportu-nity offers. Hence the attempt to appease the souls of the slaughtered victims would naturallyblend, at least in the popular conception, with the attempt to pacify the slain corn-spirit. Andas the dead came back in the sprouting corn, so they might be thought to return in the springflowers, waked from their long sleep by the soft vernal airs. They had been laid to their restunder the sod. What more natural than to imagine that the violets and the hyacinths, theroses and the anemones, sprang from their dust, were empurpled or incarnadined by theirPage 265"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"blood, and contained some portion of their spirit? “I sometimes think that never blows so red The Rose as where some buried Caesar bled; That every Hyacinth the Garden wears Dropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head. “And this reviving Herb whose tender Green Fledges the River-Lip on which we lean— Ah, lean upon it lightly, for who knows From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen?”In the summer after the battle of Landen, the most sanguinary battle of the seventeenth cen-tury in Europe, the earth, saturated with the blood of twenty thousand slain, broke forth intomillions of poppies, and the traveller who passed that vast sheet of scarlet might well fancythat the earth had indeed given up her dead. At Athens the great Commemoration of theDead fell in spring about the middle of March, when the early flowers are in bloom. Then thedead were believed to rise from their graves and go about the streets, vainly endeavouring toenter the temples and dwellings, which were barred against these perturbed spirits withropes, buckthorn, and pitch. The name of the festival, according to the most obvious and nat-ural interpretation, means the Festival of Flowers, and the title would fit well with the sub-stance of the ceremonies if at that season the poor ghosts were indeed thought to creep fromthe narrow house with the opening flowers. There may therefore be a measure of truth in thetheory of Renan, who saw in the Adonis worship a dreamy voluptuous cult of death, con-ceived not as the King of Terrors, but as an insidious enchanter who lures his victims to him-self and lulls them into an eternal sleep. The infinite charm of nature in the Lebanon, hethought, lends itself to religious emotions of this sensuous, visionary sort, hovering vaguelybetween pain and pleasure, between slumber and tears. It would doubtless be a mistake toattribute to Syrian peasants the worship of a conception so purely abstract as that of death ingeneral. Yet it may be true that in their simple minds the thought of the reviving spirit of vege-tation was blent with the very concrete notion of the ghosts of the dead, who come to lifeagain in spring days with the early flowers, with the tender green of the corn and the many-tinted blossoms of the trees. Thus their views of the death and resurrection of nature wouldbe coloured by their views of the death and resurrection of man, by their personal sorrowsand hopes and fears. In like manner we cannot doubt that Renan’s theory of Adonis was itselfdeeply tinged by passionate memories, memories of the slumber akin to death which sealedhis own eyes on the slopes of the Lebanon, memories of the sister who sleeps in the land ofAdonis never again to wake with the anemones and the roses.Chapter XXXIIIThe Gardens of AdonisPERHAPS the best proof that Adonis was a deity of vegetation, and especially of the corn, isfurnished by the gardens of Adonis, as they were called. These were baskets or pots filledwith earth, in which wheat, barley, lettuces, fennel, and various kinds of flowers were sownand tended for eight days, chiefly or exclusively by women. Fostered by the sun’s heat, theplants shot up rapidly, but having no root they withered as rapidly away, and at the end ofeight days were carried out with the images of the dead Adonis, and flung with them into thesea or into springs.These gardens of Adonis are most naturally interpreted as representatives of Adonis or mani-Page 266"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"festations of his power; they represented him, true to his original nature, in vegetable form,while the images of him, with which they were carried out and cast into the water, portrayedhim in his later human shape. All these Adonis ceremonies, if I am right, were originallyintended as charms to promote the growth or revival of vegetation; and the principle by whichthey were supposed to produce this effect was homoeopathic or imitative magic. For ignorantpeople suppose that by mimicking the effect which they desire to produce they actually helpto produce it; thus by sprinkling water they make rain, by lighting a fire they make sunshine,and so on. Similarly, by mimicking the growth of crops they hope to ensure a good harvest.The rapid growth of the wheat and barley in the gardens of Adonis was intended to make thecorn shoot up; and the throwing of the gardens and of the images into the water was a charmto secure a due supply of fertilising rain. The same, I take it, was the object of throwing theeffigies of Death and the Carnival into water in the corresponding ceremonies of modernEurope. Certainly the custom of drenching with water a leaf-clad person, who undoubtedlypersonifies vegetation, is still resorted to in Europe for the express purpose of producing rain.Similarly the custom of throwing water on the last corn cut at harvest, or on the person whobrings it home (a custom observed in Germany and France, and till lately in England andScotland), is in some places practised with the avowed intent to procure rain for the nextyear’s crops. Thus in Wallachia and amongst the Roumanians in Transylvania, when a girl isbringing home a crown made of the last ears of corn cut at harvest, all who meet her hastento throw water on her, and two farm-servants are placed at the door for the purpose; for theybelieve that if this were not done, the crops next year would perish from drought. At the springploughing in Prussia, when the ploughmen and sowers returned in the evening from theirwork in the fields, the farmer’s wife and the servants used to splash water over them. Theploughmen and sowers retorted by seizing every one, throwing them into the pond, and duck-ing them under the water. The farmer’s wife might claim exemption on payment of a forfeit,but every one else had to be ducked. By observing this custom they hoped to ensure a duesupply of rain for the seed.The opinion that the gardens of Adonis are essentially charms to promote the growth of vege-tation, especially of the crops, and that they belong to the same class of customs as thosespring and mid-summer folk-customs of modern Europe which I have described else-where,does not rest for its evidence merely on the intrinsic probability of the case. Fortunately weare able to show that gardens of Adonis (if we may use the expression in a general sense)are still planted, first, by a primitive race at their sowing season, and, second, by Europeanpeasants at midsummer. Amongst the Oraons and Mundas of Bengal, when the time comesfor planting out the rice which has been grown in seed-beds, a party of young people of bothsexes go to the forest and cut a young Karma-tree, or the branch of one. Bearing it in triumphthey return dancing, singing, and beating drums, and plant it in the middle of the village danc-ing-ground. A sacrifice is offered to the tree; and next morning the youth of both sexes, linkedarm-in-arm, dance in a great circle round the Karma-tree, which is decked with strips ofcoloured cloth and sham bracelets and necklets of plaited straw. As a preparation for the fes-tival, the daughters of the headman of the village cultivate blades of barley in a peculiar way.The seed is sown in moist, sandy soil, mixed with turmeric, and the blades sprout and unfoldof a pale-yellow or primrose colour. On the day of the festival the girls take up these bladesand carry them in baskets to the dancing-ground, where, prostrating themselves reverentially,they place some of the plants before the Karma-tree. Finally, the Karma-tree is taken awayand thrown into a stream or tank. The meaning of planting these barley blades and then pre-senting them to the Karma-tree is hardly open to question. Trees are supposed to exercise aquickening influence upon the growth of crops, and amongst the very people in question—theMundas or Mundaris—”the grove deities are held responsible for the crops.” Therefore, whenPage 267"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"at the season for planting out the rice the Mundas bring in a tree and treat it with so muchrespect, their object can only be to foster thereby the growth of the rice which is about to beplanted out; and the custom of causing barley blades to sprout rapidly and then presentingthem to the tree must be intended to subserve the same purpose, perhaps by reminding thetree-spirit of his duty towards the crops, and stimulating his activity by this visible example ofrapid vegetable growth. The throwing of the Karma-tree into the water is to be interpreted asa rain-charm. Whether the barley blades are also thrown into the water is not said; but if myinterpretation of the custom is right, probably they are so. A distinction between this Bengalcustom and the Greek rites of Adonis is that in the former the tree-spirit appears in his originalform as a tree; whereas in the Adonis worship he appears in human form, represented as adead man, though his vegetable nature is indicated by the gardens of Adonis, which are, soto say, a secondary manifestation of his original power as a tree-spirit.Gardens of Adonis are cultivated also by the Hindoos, with the intention apparently of ensur-ing the fertility both of the earth and of mankind. Thus at Oodeypoor in Rajputana a festival isheld in honour of Gouri, or Isani, the goddess of abundance. The rites begin when the sunenters the sign of the Ram, the opening of the Hindoo year. An image of the goddess Gouri ismade of earth, and a smaller one of her husband Iswara, and the two are placed together. Asmall trench is next dug, barley is sown in it, and the ground watered and heated artificially tillthe grain sprouts, when the women dance round it hand in hand, invoking the blessing ofGouri on their husbands. After that the young corn is taken up and distributed by the womento the men, who wear it in their turbans. In these rites the distribution of the barley shoots tothe men, and the invocation of a blessing on their husbands by the wives, point clearly to thedesire of offspring as one motive for observing the custom. The same motive probablyexplains the use of gardens of Adonis at the marriage of Brahmans in the Madras Presidency.Seeds of five or nine sorts are mixed and sown in earthen pots, which are made specially forthe purpose and are filled with earth. Bride and bridegroom water the seeds both morningand evening for four days; and on the fifth day the seedlings are thrown, like the real gardensof Adonis, into a tank or river.In Sardinia the gardens of Adonis are still planted in connexion with the great midsummer fes-tival which bears the name of St. John. At the end of March or on the first of April a youngman of the village presents himself to a girl, and asks her to be his comare (gossip or sweet-heart), offering to be her compare. The invitation is considered as an honour by the girl’s fam-ily, and is gladly accepted. At the end of May the girl makes a pot of the bark of the cork-tree,fills it with earth, and sows a handful of wheat and barley in it. The pot being placed in thesun and often watered, the corn sprouts rapidly and has a good head by Midsummer Eve (St.John’s Eve, the twenty-third of June). The pot is then called Erme or Nenneri. On St. John’sDay the young man and the girl, dressed in their best, accompanied by a long retinue andpreceded by children gambolling and frolicking, move in procession to a church outside thevillage. Here they break the pot by throwing it against the door of the church. Then they sitdown in a ring on the grass and eat eggs and herbs to the music of flutes. Wine is mixed in acup and passed round, each one drinking as it passes. Then they join hands and sing“Sweethearts of St. John” (Compare e comare di San Giovanni) over and over again, theflutes playing the while. When they tire of singing they stand up and dance gaily in a ring tillevening. This is the general Sardinian custom. As practised at Ozieri it has some special fea-tures. In May the pots are made of cork-bark and planted with corn, as already described.Then on the Eve of St. John the window-sills are draped with rich cloths, on which the potsare placed, adorned with crimson and blue silk and ribbons of various colours. On each of thepots they used formerly to place a statuette or cloth doll dressed as a woman, or a Priapus-Page 268"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"like figure made of paste; but this custom, rigorously forbidden by the Church, has fallen intodisuse. The village swains go about in a troop to look at the pots and their decorations and towait for the girls, who assemble on the public square to celebrate the festival. Here a greatbonfire is kindled, round which they dance and make merry. Those who wish to be“Sweethearts of St. John” act as follows. The young man stands on one side of the bonfireand the girl on the other, and they, in a manner, join hands by each grasping one end of along stick, which they pass three times backwards and forwards across the fire, thus thrustingtheir hands thrice rapidly into the flames. This seals their relationship to each other. Dancingand music go on till late at night. The correspondence of these Sardinian pots of grain to thegardens of Adonis seems complete, and the images formerly placed in them answer to theimages of Adonis which accompanied his gardens.Customs of the same sort are observed at the same season in Sicily. Pairs of boys and girlsbecome gossips of St. John on St. John’s Day by drawing each a hair from his or her headand performing various ceremonies over them. Thus they tie the hairs together and throwthem up in the air, or exchange them over a potsherd, which they afterwards break in two,preserving each a fragment with pious care. The tie formed in the latter way is supposed tolast for life. In some parts of Sicily the gossips of St. John present each other with plates ofsprouting corn, lentils, and canary seed, which have been planted forty days before the festi-val. The one who receives the plate pulls a stalk of the young plants, binds it with a ribbon,and preserves it among his or her greatest treasures, restoring the platter to the giver. AtCatania the gossips exchange pots of basil and great cucumbers; the girls tend the basil, andthe thicker it grows the more it is prized.In these midsummer customs of Sardinia and Sicily it is possible that, as Mr. R. Wünsch sup-poses, St. John has replaced Adonis. We have seen that the rites of Tammuz or Adonis werecommonly celebrated about midsummer; according to Jerome, their date was June.In Sicily gardens of Adonis are still sown in spring as well as in summer, from which we mayperhaps infer that Sicily as well as Syria celebrated of old a vernal festival of the dead andrisen god. At the approach of Easter, Sicilian women sow wheat, lentils, and canaryseed inplates, which they keep in the dark and water every two days. The plants soon shoot up; thestalks are tied together with red ribbons, and the plates containing them are placed on thesepulchres which, with the effigies of the dead Christ, are made up in Catholic and Greekchurches on Good Friday, just as the gardens of Adonis were placed on the grave of the deadAdonis. The practice is not confined to Sicily, for it is observed also at Cosenza in Calabria,and perhaps in other places. The whole custom—sepulchres as well as plates of sproutinggrain—may be nothing but a continuation, under a different name, of the worship of Adonis.Nor are these Sicilian and Calabrian customs the only Easter ceremonies which resemble therites of Adonis. “During the whole of Good Friday a waxen effigy of the dead Christ isexposed to view in the middle of the Greek churches and is covered with fervent kisses bythe thronging crowd, while the whole church rings with melancholy, monotonous dirges. Latein the evening, when it has grown quite dark, this waxen image is carried by the priests intothe street on a bier adorned with lemons, roses, jessamine, and other flowers, and therebegins a grand procession of the multitude, who move in serried ranks, with slow and solemnstep, through the whole town. Every man carries his taper and breaks out into doleful lamen-tation. At all the houses which the procession passes there are seated women with censers tofumigate the marching host. Thus the community solemnly buries its Christ as if he had justdied. At last the waxen image is again deposited in the church, and the same lugubriousPage 269"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"chants echo anew. These lamentations, accompanied by a strict fast, continue till midnight onSaturday. As the clock strikes twelve, the bishop appears and announces the glad tidings that‘Christ is risen,’ to which the crowd replies, ‘He is risen indeed,’ and at once the whole citybursts into an uproar of joy, which finds vent in shrieks and shouts, in the endless dischargeof carronades and muskets, and the explosion of fire-works of every sort. In the very samehour people plunge from the extremity of the fast into the enjoyment of the Easter lamb andneat wine.”In like manner the Catholic Church has been accustomed to bring before its followers in a vis-ible form the death and resurrection of the Redeemer. Such sacred dramas are well fitted toimpress the lively imagination and to stir the warm feelings of a susceptible southern race, towhom the pomp and pageantry of Catholicism are more congenial than to the colder tem-perament of the Teutonic peoples.When we reflect how often the Church has skilfully contrived to plant the seeds of the newfaith on the old stock of paganism, we may surmise that the Easter celebration of the deadand risen Christ was grafted upon a similar celebration of the dead and risen Adonis, which,as we have seen reason to believe, was celebrated in Syria at the same season. The type,created by Greek artists, of the sorrowful goddess with her dying lover in her arms, resemblesand may have been the model of the Pietà of Christian art, the Virgin with the dead body ofher divine Son in her lap, of which the most celebrated example is the one by Michael Angeloin St. Peters. That noble group, in which the living sorrow of the mother contrasts so wonder-fully with the languor of death in the son, is one of the finest compositions in marble. AncientGreek art has bequeathed to us few works so beautiful, and none so pathetic.In this connexion a well-known statement of Jerome may not be without significance. He tellsus that Bethlehem, the traditionary birthplace of the Lord, was shaded by a grove of that stillolder Syrian Lord, Adonis, and that where the infant Jesus had wept, the lover of Venus wasbewailed. Though he does not expressly say so, Jerome seems to have thought that thegrove of Adonis had been planted by the heathen after the birth of Christ for the purpose ofdefiling the sacred spot. In this he may have been mistaken. If Adonis was indeed, as I haveargued, the spirit of the corn, a more suitable name for his dwelling-place could hardly befound than Bethlehem, “the House of Bread,” and he may well have been worshipped there athis House of Bread long ages before the birth of Him who said, “I am the bread of life.” Evenon the hypothesis that Adonis followed rather than preceded Christ at Bethlehem, the choiceof his sad figure to divert the allegiance of Christians from their Lord cannot but strike us aseminently appropriate when we remember the similarity of the rites which commemorated thedeath and resurrection of the two. One of the earliest seats of the worship of the new godwas Antioch, and at Antioch, as we have seen, the death of the old god was annually cele-brated withgreat solemnity. A circumstance which attended the entrance of Julian into the city at the timeof the Adonis festival may perhaps throw some lighton the date of its celebration. When the emperor drew near to the city he was received withpublic prayers as if he had been a god, and he marvelled at the voices of a great multitudewho cried that the Star of Salvation had dawned upon them in the East. This may doubtlesshave been no more than a fulsome compliment paid by an obsequious Oriental crowd to theRoman emperor. But it is also possible that the rising of a bright star regularly gave the signalfor the festival, and that as chance would have it the star emerged above the rim of the east-ern horizon at the very moment of the emperor’s approach. The coincidence, if it happened,could hardly fail to strike the imagination of a superstitious and excited multitude, who mightPage 270"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"thereupon hail the great man as the deity whose coming was announced by the sign in theheavens. Or the emperor may have mistaken for a greeting to himself the shouts which wereaddressed to the star. Now Astarte, the divine mistress of Adonis, was identified with the plan-et Venus, and her changes from a morning to an evening star were carefully noted by theBabylonian astronomers, who drew omens from her alternate appearance and disappear-ance. Hence we may conjecture that the festival of Adonis was regularly timed to coincidewith the appearance of Venus as the Morning or Evening Star. But the star which the peopleof Antioch saluted at the festival was seen in the East; therefore, if it was indeed Venus, it canonly have been the Morning Star. At Aphaca in Syria, where there was a famous temple ofAstarte, the signal for the celebration of the rites was apparently given by the flashing of ameteor, which on a certain day fell like a star from the top of Mount Lebanon into the riverAdonis. The meteor was thought to be Astarte herself, and its flight through the air might nat-urally be interpreted as the descent of the amorous goddess to the arms of her lover. AtAntioch and elsewhere the appearance of the Morning Star on the day of the festival may inlike manner have been hailed as the coming of the goddess of love to wake her dead lemanfrom his earthy bed. If that were so, we may surmise that it was the Morning Star which guid-ed the wise men of the East to Bethlehem, the hallowed spot which heard, in the language ofJerome, the weeping of the infant Christ and the lament for Adonis.Chapter XXXIVThe Myth and Ritual of AttisANOTHER of those gods whose supposed death and resurrection struck such deep roots intothe faith and ritual of Western Asia is Attis. He was to Phrygia what Adonis was to Syria. LikeAdonis, he appears to have been a god of vegetation, and his death and resurrection wereannually mourned and rejoiced over at a festival in spring. The legends and rites of the twogods were so much alike that the ancients themselves sometimes identified them. Attis wassaid to have been a fair young shepherd or herdsman beloved by Cybele, the Mother of theGods, a great Asiatic goddess of fertility, who had her chief home in Phrygia. Some held thatAttis was her son. His birth, like that of many other heroes, is said to have been miraculous.His mother, Nana, was a virgin, who conceived by putting a ripe almond or a pomegranate inher bosom. Indeed in the Phrygian cosmogony an almond figured as the father of all things,perhaps because its delicate lilac blossom is one of the first heralds of the spring, appearingon the bare boughs before the leaves have opened. Such tales of virgin mothers are relics ofan age of childish ignorance when men had not yet recognized the intercourse of the sexesas the true cause of offspring. Two different accounts of the death of Attis were current.According to the one he was killed by a boar, like Adonis. According to the other heunmanned himself under a pine-tree, and bled to death on the spot. The latter is said to havebeen the local story told by the people of Pessinus, a great seat of the worship of Cybele,and the whole legend of which the story forms a part is stamped with a character of rudenessand savagery that speaks strongly for its antiquity. Both tales might claim the support of cus-tom, or rather both were probably invented to explain certain customs observed by the wor-shippers. The story of the self-mutilation of Attis is clearly an attempt to account for the self-mutilation of his priests, who regularly castrated themselves on entering the service of thegoddess. The story of his death by the boar may have been told to explain why his worship-pers, especially the people of Pessinus, abstained from eating swine. In like manner the wor-shippers of Adonis abstained from pork, because a boar had killed their god. After his deathAttis is said to have been changed into a pine-tree.The worship of the Phrygian Mother of the Gods was adopted by the Romans in 204 B.C.Page 271"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"towards the close of their long struggle with Hannibal. For their drooping spirits had beenopportunely cheered by a prophecy, alleged to be drawn from that convenient farrago of non-sense, the Sibylline Books, that the foreign invader would be driven from Italy if the greatOriental goddess were brought to Rome. Accordingly ambassadors were despatched to hersacred city Pessinus in Phrygia. The small black stone which embodied the mighty divinitywas entrusted to them and conveyed to Rome, where it was received with great respect andinstalled in the temple of Victory on the Palatine Hill. It was the middle of April when the god-dess arrived, and she went to work at once. For the harvest that year was such as had notbeen seen for many a long day, and in the very next year Hannibal and his veteransembarked for Africa. As he looked his last on the coast of Italy, fading behind him in the dis-tance, he could not foresee that Europe, which had repelled the arms, would yet yield to thegods, of the Orient. The vanguard of the conquerors had already encamped in the heart ofItaly before the rearguard of the beaten army fell sullenly back from its shores.We may conjecture, though we are not told, that the Mother of the Gods brought with her theworship of her youthful lover or son to her new home in the West. Certainly the Romans werefamiliar with the Galli, the emasculated priests of Attis, before the close of the Republic.These unsexed beings, in their Oriental costume, with little images suspended on theirbreasts, appear to have been a familiar sight in the streets of Rome, which they traversed inprocession, carrying the image of the goddess and chanting their hymns to the music of cym-bals and tambourines, flutes and horns, while the people, impressed by the fantastic showand moved by the wild strains, flung alms to them in abundance, and buried the image and itsbearers under showers of roses. A further step was taken by the Emperor Claudius when heincorporated the Phrygian worship of the sacred tree, and with it probably the orgiastic rites ofAttis, in the established religion of Rome. The great spring festival of Cybele and Attis is bestknown to us in the form in which it was celebrated at Rome; but as we are informed that theRoman ceremonies were also Phrygian, we may assume that they differed hardly, if at all,from their Asiatic original. The order of the festival seems to have been as follows.On the twenty-second day of March, a pine-tree was cut in the woods and brought into thesanctuary of Cybele, where it was treated as a great divinity. The duty of carrying the sacredtree was entrusted to a guild of Tree-bearers. The trunk was swathed like a corpse withwoollen bands and decked with wreaths of violets, for violets were said to have sprung fromthe blood of Attis, as roses and anemones from the blood of Adonis; and the effigy of a youngman, doubtless Attis himself, was tied to the middle of the stem. On the second day of thefestival, the twenty-third of March, the chief ceremony seems to have been a blowing of trum-pets. The third day, the twenty-fourth of March, was known as the Day of Blood: theArchigallus or highpriest drew blood from his arms and presented it as an offering. Nor washe alone in making this bloody sacrifice. Stirred by the wild barbaric music of clashing cym-bals, rumbling drums, droning horns, and screaming flutes, the inferior clergy whirled about inthe dance with waggling heads and streaming hair, until, rapt into a frenzy of excitement andinsensible to pain, they gashed their bodies with potsherds or slashed them with knives inorder to bespatter the altar and the sacred tree with their flowing blood. The ghastly rite prob-ably formed part of the mourning for Attis and may have been intended to strengthen him forthe resurrection. The Australian aborigines cut themselves in like manner over the graves oftheir friends for the purpose, perhaps, of enabling them to be born again. Further, we mayconjecture, though we are not expressly told, that it was on the same Day of Blood and forthe same purpose that the novices sacrificed their virility. Wrought up to the highest pitch ofreligious excitement they dashed the severed portions of themselves against the image of thecruel goddess. These broken instruments of fertility were afterwards reverently wrapt up andPage 272"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"buried in the earth or in subterranean chambers sacred to Cybele, where, like the offering ofblood, they may have been deemed instrumental in recalling Attis to life and hastening thegeneral resurrection of nature, which was then bursting into leaf and blossom in the vernalsunshine. Some confirmation of this conjecture is furnished by the savage story that themother of Attis conceived by putting in her bosom a pomegranate sprung from the severedgenitals of a man-monster named Agdestis, a sort of double of Attis.If there is any truth in this conjectural explanation of the custom, we can readily understandwhy other Asiatic goddesses of fertility were served in like manner by eunuch priests. Thesefeminine deities required to receive from their male ministers, who personated the divinelovers, the means of discharging their beneficent functions: they had themselves to beimpregnated by the life-giving energy before they could transmit it to the world. Goddessesthus ministered to by eunuch priests were the great Artemis of Ephesus and the great SyrianAstarte of Hierapolis, whose sanctuary, frequented by swarms of pilgrims and enriched by theofferings of Assyria and Babylonia, of Arabia and Phoenicia, was perhaps in the days of itsglory the most popular in the East. Now the unsexed priests of this Syrian goddess resem-bled those of Cybele so closely that some people took them to be the same. And the mode inwhich they dedicated themselves to the religious life was similar. The greatest festival of theyear at Hierapolis fell at the beginning of spring, when multitudes thronged to the sanctuaryfrom Syria and the regions round about. While the flutes played, the drums beat, and theeunuch priests slashed themselves with knives, the religious excitement gradually spread likea wave among the crowd of onlookers, and many a one did that which he little thought to dowhen he came as a holiday spectator to the festival. For man after man, his veins throbbingwith the music, his eyes fascinated by the sight of the streaming blood, flung his garmentsfrom him, leaped forth with a shout, and seizing one of the swords which stood ready for thepurpose, castrated himself on the spot. Then he ran through the city, holding the bloodypieces in his hand, till he threw them into one of the houses which he passed in his madcareer. The household thus honoured had to furnish him with a suit of female attire andfemale ornaments, which he wore for the rest of his life. When the tumult of emotion had sub-sided, and the man had come to himself again, the irrevocable sacrifice must often have beenfollowed by passionate sorrow and lifelong regret. This revulsion of natural human feelingafter the frenzies of a fanatical religion is powerfully depicted by Catullus in a celebratedpoem.The parallel of these Syrian devotees confirms the view that in the similar worship of Cybelethe sacrifice of virility took place on the Day of Blood at the vernal rites of the goddess, whenthe violets, supposed to spring from the red drops of her wounded lover, were in bloomamong the pines. Indeed the story that Attis unmanned himself under a pine-tree was clearlydevised to explain why his priests did the same beside the sacred violet-wreathed tree at hisfestival. At all events, we can hardly doubt that the Day of Blood witnessed the mourning forAttis over an effigy of him which was afterwards buried. The image thus laid in the sepulchrewas probably the same which had hung upon the tree. Throughout the period of mourning theworshippers fasted from bread, nominally because Cybele had done so in her grief for thedeath of Attis, but really perhaps for the same reason which induced the women of Harran toabstain from eating anything ground in a mill while they wept for Tammuz. To partake of breador flour at such a season might have been deemed a wanton profanation of the bruised andbroken body of the god. Or the fast may possibly have been a preparation for a sacramentalmeal.But when night had fallen, the sorrow of the worshippers was turned to joy. For suddenly aPage 273"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"light shone in the darkness: the tomb was opened: the god had risen from the dead; and asthe priest touched the lips of the weeping mourners with balm, he softly whispered in theirears the glad tidings of salvation. The resurrection of the god was hailed by his disciples as apromise that they too would issue triumphant from the corruption of the grave. On the mor-row, the twenty-fifth day of March, which was reckoned the vernal equinox, the divine resur-rection was celebrated with a wild outburst of glee. At Rome, and probably elsewhere, thecelebration took the form of a carnival. It was the Festival of Joy (Hilaria). A universal licenceprevailed. Every man might say and do what he pleased. People went about the streets indisguise. No dignity was too high or too sacred for the humblest citizen to assume withimpunity. In the reign of Commodus a band of conspirators thought to take advantage of themasquerade by dressing in the uniform of the Imperial Guard, and so, mingling with thecrowd of merrymakers, to get within stabbing distance of the emperor. But the plot miscarried.Even the stern Alexander Severus used to relax so far on the joyous day as to admit apheasant to his frugal board. The next day, the twenty-sixth of March, was given to repose,which must have been much needed after the varied excitements and fatigues of the preced-ing days. Finally, the Roman festival closed on the twenty-seventh of March with a processionto the brook Almo. The silver image of the goddess, with its face of jagged black stone, sat ina waggon drawn by oxen. Preceded by the nobles walking barefoot, it moved slowly, to theloud music of pipes and tambourines, out by the Porta Capena, and so down to the banks ofthe Almo, which flows into the Tiber just below the walls of Rome. There the high-priest,robed in purple, washed the waggon, the image, and the other sacred objects in the water ofthe stream. On returning from their bath, the wain and the oxen were strewn with fresh springflowers. All was mirth and gaiety. No one thought of the blood that had flowed so lately. Eventhe eunuch priests forgot their wounds.Such, then, appears to have been the annual solemnisation of the death and resurrection ofAttis in spring. But besides these public rites, his worship is known to have comprised certainsecret or mystic ceremonies, which probably aimed at bringing the worshipper, and especiallythe novice, into closer communication with his god. Our information as to the nature of thesemysteries and the date of their celebration is unfortunately very scanty, but they seem to haveincluded a sacramental meal and a baptism of blood. In the sacrament the novice became apartaker of the mysteries by eating out of a drum and drinking out of a cymbal, two instru-ments of music which figured prominently in the thrilling orchestra of Attis. The fast whichaccompanied the mourning for the dead god may perhaps have been designed to preparethe body of the communicant for the reception of the blessed sacrament by purging it of allthat could defile by contact the sacred elements. In the baptism the devotee, crowned withgold and wreathed with fillets, descended into a pit, the mouth of which was covered with awooden grating. A bull, adorned with garlands of flowers, its forehead glittering with gold leaf,was then driven on to the grating and there stabbed to death with a consecrated spear. Its hotreeking blood poured in torrents through the apertures, and was received with devout eager-ness by the worshipper on every part of his person and garments, till he emerged from thepit, drenched, dripping, and scarlet from head to foot, to receive the homage, nay the adora-tion, of his fellows as one who had been born again to eternal life and had washed away hissins in the blood of the bull. For some time afterwards the fiction of a new birth was kept upby dieting him on milk like a new-born babe. The regeneration of the worshipper took place atthe same time as the regeneration of his god, namely at the vernal equinox. At Rome the newbirth and the remission of sins by the shedding of bull’s blood appear to have been carriedout above all at the sanctuary of the Phrygian goddess on the Vatican Hill, at or near the spotwhere the great basilica of St. Peter’s now stands; for many inscriptions relating to the riteswere found when the church was being enlarged in 1608 or 1609. From the Vatican as a cen-Page 274"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"tre this barbarous system of superstition seems to have spread to other parts of the Romanempire. Inscriptions found in Gaul and Germany prove that provincial sanctuaries modelledtheir ritual on that of the Vatican. From the same source we learn that the testicles as well asthe blood of the bull played an important part in the ceremonies. Probably they were regardedas a powerful charm to promote fertility and hasten the new birth.Chapter XXXVAttis as a God of VegetationTHE original character of Attis as a tree-spirit is brought out plainly by the part which the pine-tree plays in his legend, his ritual, and his monuments. The story that he was a human beingtransformed into a pine-tree is only one of those transparent attempts at rationalising oldbeliefs which meet us so frequently in mythology. The bringing in of the pine-tree from thewoods, decked with violets and woollen bands, is like bringing in the May-tree or Summer-tree in modern folk-custom; and the effigy which was attached to the pine-tree was only aduplicate representative of the tree-spirit Attis. After being fastened to the tree, the effigy waskept for a year and then burned. The same thing appears to have been sometimes done withthe May-pole; and in like manner the effigy of the corn-spirit, made at harvest, is often pre-served till it is replaced by a new effigy at next year’s harvest. The original intention of suchcustoms was no doubt to maintain the spirit of vegetation in life throughout the year. Why thePhrygians should have worshipped the pine above other trees we can only guess. Perhapsthe sight of its changeless, though sombre, green cresting the ridges of the high hills abovethe fading splendour of the autumn woods in the valleys may have seemed to their eyes tomark it out as the seat of a diviner life, of something exempt from the sad vicissitudes of theseasons, constant and eternal as the sky which stooped to meet it. For the same reason, per-haps, ivy was sacred to Attis; at all events, we read that his eunuch priests were tattooed witha pattern of ivy leaves. Another reason for the sanctity of the pine may have been its useful-ness. The cones of the stone-pine contain edible nut-like seeds, which have been used asfood since antiquity, and are still eaten, for example, by the poorer classes in Rome.Moreover, a wine was brewed from these seeds, and this may partly account for the orgiasticnature of the rites of Cybele, which the ancients compared to those of Dionysus. Further,pine-cones were regarded as symbols or rather instruments of fertility. Hence at the festival ofthe Thesmophoria they were thrown, along with pigs and other agents or emblems of fecundi-ty, into the sacred vaults of Demeter for the purpose of quickening the ground and the wombsof women.Like tree-spirits in general, Attis was apparently thought to wield power over the fruits of theearth or even to be identical with the corn. One of his epithets was “very fruitful”: he wasaddressed as the “reaped green (or yellow) ear of corn”; and the story of his sufferings,death, and resurrection was interpreted as the ripe grain wounded by the reaper, buried in thegranary, and coming to life again when it is sown in the ground. A statue of him in the LateranMuseum at Rome clearly indicates his relation to the fruits of the earth, and particularly to thecorn; for it represents him with a bunch of ears of corn and fruit in his hand, and a wreath ofpine-cones, pomegranates, and other fruits on his head, while from the top of his Phrygiancap ears of corn are sprouting. On a stone urn, which contained the ashes of an Archigallusor high-priest of Attis, the same idea is expressed in a slightly different way. The top of theurn is adorned with ears of corn carved in relief, and it is surmounted by the figure of a cock,whose tail consists of ears of corn. Cybele in like manner was conceived as a goddess of fer-tility who could make or mar the fruits of the earth; for the people of Augustodunum (Autun) inGaul used to cart her image about in a waggon for the good of the fields and vineyards, whilePage 275"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"they danced and sang before it, and we have seen that in Italy an unusually fine harvest wasattributed to the recent arrival of the Great Mother. The bathing of the image of the goddessin a river may well have been a rain-charm to ensure an abundant supply of moisture for thecrops.Chapter XXXVIHuman Representatives of AttisFROM inscriptions it appears that both at Pessinus and Rome the high-priest of Cybele regu-larly bore the name of Attis. It is therefore a reasonable conjecture that he played the part ofhis namesake, the legendary Attis, at the annual festival. We have seen that on the Day ofBlood he drew blood from his arms, and this may have been an imitation of the self-inflicteddeath of Attis under the pine-tree. It is not inconsistent with this supposition that Attis was alsorepresented at these ceremonies by an effigy; for instances can be shown in which the divinebeing is first represented by a living person and afterwards by an effigy, which is then burnedor otherwise destroyed. Perhaps we may go a step farther and conjecture that this mimickilling of the priest, accompanied by a real effusion of his blood, was in Phrygia, as it hasbeen elsewhere, a substitute for a human sacrifice which in earlier times was actually offered.Areminiscence of the manner in which these old representatives of the deity were put todeath is perhaps preserved in the famous story of Marsyas. He was said to be a Phrygiansatyr or Silenus, according to others a shepherd or herdsman, who played sweetly on theflute. A friend of Cybele, he roamed the country with the disconsolate goddess to soothe hergrief for the death of Attis. The composition of the Mother’s Air, a tune played on the flute inhonour of the Great Mother Goddess, was attributed to him by the people of Celaenae inPhrygia. Vain of his skill, he challenged Apollo to a musical contest, he to play on the fluteand Apollo on the lyre. Being vanquished, Marsyas was tied up to a pine-tree and flayed orcut limb from limb either by the victorious Apollo or by a Scythian slave. His skin was shownat Celaenae in historical times. It hung at the foot of the citadel in a cave from which the riverMarsyas rushed with an impetuous and noisy tide to join the Maeander. So the Adonis burstsfull-born from the precipices of the Lebanon; so the blue river of Ibreez leaps in a crystal jetfrom the red rocks of the Taurus; so the stream, which now rumbles deep underground, usedto gleam for a moment on its passage from darkness to darkness in the dim light of theCorycian cave. In all these copious fountains, with their glad promise of fertility and life, menof old saw the hand of God and worshipped him beside the rushing river with the music of itstumbling waters in their ears. At Celaenae, if we can trust tradition, the piper Marsyas, hang-ing in his cave, had a soul for harmony even in death; for it is said that at the sound of hisnative Phrygian melodies the skin of the dead satyr used to thrill, but that if the musicianstruck up an air in praise of Apollo it remained deaf and motionless.In this Phrygian satyr, shepherd, or herdsman who enjoyed the friendship of Cybele, practisedthe music so characteristic of her rites, and died a violent death on her sacred tree, the pine,may we not detect a close resemblance to Attis, the favourite shepherd or herdsman of thegoddess, who is himself described as a piper, is said to have perished under a pine-tree, andwas annually represented by an effigy hung, like Marsyas, upon a pine? We may conjecturethat in old days the priest who bore the name and played the part of Attis at the spring festivalof Cybele was regularly hanged or otherwise slain upon the sacred tree, and that this bar-barous custom was afterwards mitigated into the form in which it is known to us in later times,when the priest merely drew blood from his body under the tree and attached an effigyinstead of himself to its trunk. In the holy grove at Upsala men and animals were sacrificed byPage 276"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"being hanged upon the sacred trees. The human victims dedicated to Odin were regularly putto death by hanging or by a combination of hanging and stabbing, the man being strung up toa tree or a gallows and then wounded with a spear. Hence Odin was called the Lord of theGallows or the God of the Hanged, and he is represented sitting under a gallows tree. Indeedhe is said to have been sacrificed to himself in the ordinary way, as we learn from the weirdverses of the Havamal, in which the god describes how he acquired his divine power bylearning the magic runes: “I know that I hung on the windy tree For nine whole nights, Wounded with the spear, dedicated to Odin, Myself to myself.” The Bagobos of Mindanao, one of the Philippine Islands, used annually to sacrifice humanvictims for the good of the crops in a similar way. Early in December, when the constellationOrion appeared at seven o’clock in the evening, the people knew that the time had come toclear their fields for sowing and to sacrifice a slave. The sacrifice was presented to certainpowerful spirits as payment for the good year which the people had enjoyed, and to ensurethe favour of the spirits for the coming season. The victim was led to a great tree in the forest;there he was tied with his back to the tree and his arms stretched high above his head, in theattitude in which ancient artists portrayed Marsyas hanging on the fatal tree. While he thushung by the arms, he was slain by a spear thrust through his body at the level of the armpits.Afterwards the body was cut clean through the middle at the waist, and the upper part wasapparently allowed to dangle for a little from the tree, while the under part wallowed in bloodon the ground. The two portions were finally cast into a shallow trench beside the tree. Beforethis was done, anybody who wished might cut off a piece of flesh or a lock of hair from thecorpse and carry it to the grave of some relation whose body was being consumed by aghoul. Attracted by the fresh corpse, the ghoul would leave the mouldering old body in peace.These sacrifices have been offered by men now living.In Greece the great goddess Artemis herself appears to have been annually hanged in effigyin her sacred grove of Condylea among the Arcadian hills, and there accordingly she went bythe name of the Hanged One. Indeed a trace of a similar rite may perhaps be detected evenat Ephesus, the most famous of her sanctuaries, in the legend of a woman who hanged her-self and was thereupon dressed by the compassionate goddess in her own divine garb andcalled by the name of Hecate. Similarly, at Melite in Phthia, a story was told of a girl namedAspalis who hanged herself, but who appears to have been merely a form of Artemis. Forafter her death her body could not be found, but an image of her was discovered standingbeside the image of Artemis, and the people bestowed on it the title of Hecaerge or Far-shooter, one of the regular epithets of the goddess. Every year the virgins sacrificed a younggoat to the image by hanging it, because Aspalis was said to have hanged herself. The sacri-fice may have been a substitute for hanging an image or a human representative of Artemis.Again, in Rhodes the fair Helen was worshipped under the title of Helen of the Tree, becausethe queen of the island had caused her handmaids, disguised as Furies, to string her up to abough. That the Asiatic Greeks sacrificed animals in this fashion is proved by coins of Ilium,which represent an ox or cow hanging on a tree and stabbed with a knife by a man, who sitsamong the branches or on the animal’s back. At Hierapolis also the victims were hung ontrees before they were burnt. With these Greek and Scandinavian parallels before us we canhardly dismiss as wholly improbable the conjecture that in Phrygia a man-god may have hungyear by year on the sacred but fatal tree.Page 277"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Chapter XXXVIIOriental Religions in the WestTHE worship of the Great Mother of the Gods and her lover or son was very popular underthe Roman Empire. Inscriptions prove that the two received divine honours, separately orconjointly, not only in Italy, and especially at Rome, but also in the provinces, particularly inAfrica, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, and Bulgaria. Their worship survived the establish-ment of Christianity by Constantine; for Symmachus records the recurrence of the festival ofthe Great Mother, and in the days of Augustine her effeminate priests still paraded the streetsand squares of Carthage with whitened faces, scented hair, and mincing gait, while, like themendicant friars of the Middle Ages, they begged alms from the passers-by. In Greece, on theother hand, the bloody orgies of the Asiatic goddess and her consort appear to have found lit-tle favour. The barbarous and cruel character of the worship, with its frantic excesses, wasdoubtless repugnant to the good taste and humanity of the Greeks, who seem to have pre-ferred the kindred but gentler rites of Adonis. Yet the same features which shocked andrepelled the Greeks may have positively attracted the less refined Romans and barbarians ofthe West. The ecstatic frenzies, which were mistaken for divine inspiration, the mangling ofthe body, the theory of a new birth and the remission of sins through the shedding of blood,have all their origin in savagery, and they naturally appealed to peoples in whom the savageinstincts were still strong. Their true character was indeed often disguised under a decent veilof allegorical or philosophical interpretation, which probably sufficed to impose upon the raptand enthusiastic worshippers, reconciling even the more cultivated of them to things whichotherwise must have filled them with horror and disgust.The religion of the Great Mother, with its curious blending of crude savagery with spiritualaspirations, was only one of a multitude of similar Oriental faiths which in the later days ofpaganism spread over the Roman Empire, and by saturating the European peoples with alienideals of life gradually undermined the whole fabric of ancient civilisation. Greek and Romansociety was built on the conception of the subordination of the individual to the community, ofthe citizen to the state; it set the safety of the commonwealth, as the supreme aim of conduct,above the safety of the individual whether in this world or in the world to come. Trained frominfancy in this unselfish ideal, the citizens devoted their lives to the public service and wereready to lay them down for the common good; or if they shrank from the supreme sacrifice, itnever occurred to them that they acted otherwise than basely in preferring their personal exis-tence to the interests of their country. All this was changed by the spread of Oriental religionswhich inculcated the communion of the soul with God and its eternal salvation as the onlyobjects worth living for, objects in comparison with which the prosperity and even the exis-tence of the state sank into insignificance. The inevitable result of this selfish and immoraldoctrine was to withdraw the devotee more and more from the public service, to concentratehis thoughts on his own spiritual emotions, and to breed in him a contempt for the present lifewhich he regarded merely as a probation for a better and an eternal. The saint and therecluse, disdainful of earth and rapt in ecstatic contemplation of heaven, became in popularopinion the highest ideal of humanity, displacing the old ideal of the patriot and hero who, for-getful of self, lives and is ready to die for the good of his country. The earthly city seemedpoor and contemptible to men whose eyes beheld the City of God coming in the clouds ofheaven. Thus the centre of gravity, so to say, was shifted from the present to a future life, andhowever much the other world may have gained, there can be little doubt that this one lostheavily by the change. A general disintegration of the body politic set in. The ties of the stateand the family were loosened: the structure of society tended to resolve itself into its individ-Page 278"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"ual elements and thereby to relapse into barbarism; for civilisation is only possible throughthe active co-operation of the citizens and their willingness to subordinate their private inter-ests to the common good. Men refused to defend their country and even to continue theirkind. In their anxiety to save their own souls and the souls of others, they were content toleave the material world, which they identified with the principle of evil, to perish around them.This obsession lasted for a thousand years. The revival of Roman law, of the Aristotelian phi-losophy, of ancient art and literature at the close of the Middle Ages, marked the return ofEurope to native ideals of life and conduct, to saner, manlier views of the world. The long haltin the march of civilisation was over. The tide of Oriental invasion had turned at last. It isebbing still.Among the gods of eastern origin who in the decline of the ancient world competed againsteach other for the allegiance of the West was the old Persian deity Mithra. The immense pop-ularity of his worship is attested by the monuments illustrative of it which have been foundscattered in profusion all over the Roman Empire. In respect both of doctrines and of rites thecult of Mithra appears to have presented many points of resemblance not only to the religionof the Mother of the Gods but also to Christianity. The similarity struck the Christian doctorsthemselves and was explained by them as a work of the devil, who sought to seduce thesouls of men from the true faith by a false and insidious imitation of it. So to the Spanish con-querors of Mexico and Peru many of the native heathen rites appeared to be diabolical coun-terfeits of the Christian sacraments. With more probability the modern student of comparativereligion traces such resemblances to the similar and independent workings of the mind ofman in his sincere, if crude, attempts to fathom the secret of the universe, and to adjust hislittle life to its awful mysteries. However that may be, there can be no doubt that the Mithraicreligion proved a formidable rival to Christianity, combining as it did a solemn ritual with aspi-rations after moral purity and a hope of immortality. Indeed the issue of the conflict betweenthe two faiths appears for a time to have hung in the balance. An instructive relic of the longstruggle is preserved in our festival of Christmas, which the Church seems to have borroweddirectly from its heathen rival. In the Julian calendar the twenty-fifth of December was reck-oned the winter solstice, and it was regarded as the Nativity of the Sun, because the daybegins to lengthen and the power of the sun to increase from that turning-point of the year.The ritual of the nativity, as it appears to have been celebrated in Syria and Egypt, wasremarkable. The celebrants retired into certain inner shrines, from which at midnight theyissued with a loud cry, “The Virgin has brought forth! The light is waxing!” The Egyptians evenrepresented the new-born sun by the image of an infant which on his birthday, the winter sol-stice, they brought forth and exhibited to his worshippers. No doubt the Virgin who thus con-ceived and bore a son on the twenty-fifth of December was the great Oriental goddess whomthe Semites called the Heavenly Virgin or simply the Heavenly Goddess; in Semitic lands shewas a form of Astarte. Now Mithra was regularly identified by his worshippers with the Sun,the Unconquered Sun, as they called him; hence his nativity also fell on the twenty-fifth ofDecember. The Gospels say nothing as to the day of Christ’s birth, and accordingly the earlyChurch did not celebrate it. In time, however, the Christians of Egypt came to regard the sixthof January as the date of the Nativity, and the custom of commemorating the birth of theSaviour on that day gradually spread until by the fourth century it was universally establishedin the East. But at the end of the third or the beginning of the fourth century the WesternChurch, which had never recognised the sixth of January as the day of the Nativity, adoptedthe twenty-fifth of December as the true date, and in time its decision was accepted also bythe Eastern Church. At Antioch the change was not introduced till about the year 375 A.D.What considerations led the ecclesiastical authorities to institute the festival of Christmas?Page 279"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"The motives for the innovation are stated with great frankness by a Syrian writer, himself aChristian. “The reason,” he tells us, “why the fathers transferred the celebration of the sixth ofJanuary to the twenty-fifth of December was this. It was a custom of the heathen to celebrateon the same twenty-fifth of December the birthday of the Sun, at which they kindled lights intoken of festivity. In these solemnities and festivities the Christians also took part. Accordinglywhen the doctors of the Church perceived that the Christians had a leaning to this festival,they took counsel and resolved that the true Nativity should be solemnised on that day andthe festival of the Epiphany on the sixth of January. Accordingly, along with this custom, thepractice has prevailed of kindling fires till the sixth.” The heathen origin of Christmas is plainlyhinted at, if not tacitly admitted, by Augustine when he exhorts his Christian brethren not tocelebrate that solemn day like the heathen on account of the sun, but on account of him whomade the sun. In like manner Leo the Great rebuked the pestilent belief that Christmas wassolemnised because of the birth of the new sun, as it was called, and not because of thenativity of Christ.Thus it appears that the Christian Church chose to celebrate the birthday of its Founder onthe twenty-fifth of December in order to transfer the devotion of the heathen from the Sun tohim who was called the Sun of Righteousness. If that was so, there can be no intrinsicimprobability in the conjecture that motives of the same sort may have led the ecclesiasticalauthorities to assimilate the Easter festival of the death and resurrection of their Lord to thefestival of the death and resurrection of another Asiatic god which fell at the same season.Now the Easter rites still observed in Greece, Sicily, and Southern Italy bear in some respectsa striking resemblance to the rites of Adonis, and I have suggested that the Church may haveconsciously adapted the new festival to its heathen predecessor for the sake of winning soulsto Christ. But this adaptation probably took place in the Greek-speaking rather than in theLatin-speaking parts of the ancient world; for the worship of Adonis, while it flourished amongthe Greeks, appears to have made little impression on Rome and the West. Certainly it neverformed part of the official Roman religion. The place which it might have taken in the affec-tions of the vulgar was already occupied by the similar but more barbarous worship of Attisand the Great Mother. Now the death and resurrection of Attis were officially celebrated atRome on the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth of March, the latter being regarded as the springequinox, and therefore as the most appropriate day for the revival of a god of vegetation whohad been dead or sleeping throughout the winter. But according to an ancient and wide-spread tradition Christ suffered on the twenty-fifth of March, and accordingly some Christiansregularly celebrated the Crucifixion on that day without any regard to the state of the moon.This custom was certainly observed in Phrygia, Cappadocia, and Gaul, and there seem to begrounds for thinking that at one time it was followed also in Rome. Thus the tradition whichplaced the death of Christ on the twenty-fifth of March was ancient and deeply rooted. It is allthe more remarkable because astronomical considerations prove that it can have had no his-torical foundation. The inference appears to be inevitable that the passion of Christ must havebeen arbitrarily referred to that date in order to harmonise with an older festival of the springequinox. This is the view of the learned ecclesiastical historian Mgr. Duchesne, who pointsout that the death of the Saviour was thus made to fall upon the very day on which, accordingto a widespread belief, the world had been created. But the resurrection of Attis, who com-bined in himself the characters of the divine Father and the divine Son, was officially celebrat-ed at Rome on the same day. When we remember that the festival of St. George in April hasreplaced the ancient pagan festival of the Parilia; that the festival of St. John the Baptist inJune has succeeded to a heathen midsummer festival of water: that the festival of theAssumption of the Virgin in August has ousted the festival of Diana; that the feast of All Soulsin November is a continuation of an old heathen feast of the dead; and that the Nativity ofPage 280"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Christ himself was assigned to the winter solstice in December because that day wasdeemed the Nativity of the Sun; we can hardly be thought rash or unreasonable in conjectur-ing that the other cardinal festival of the Christian church—the solemnisation of Easter—mayhave been in like manner, and from like motives of edification, adapted to a similar celebra-tion of the Phrygian god Attis at the vernal equinox.At least it is a remarkable coincidence, if it is nothing more, that the Christian and the heathenfestivals of the divine death and resurrection should have been solemnised at the same sea-son and in the same places. For the places which celebrated the death of Christ at the springequinox were Phrygia, Gaul, and apparently Rome, that is, the very regions in which the wor-ship of Attis either originated or struck deepest root. It is difficult to regard the coincidence aspurely accidental. If the vernal equinox, the season at which in the temperate regions thewhole face of nature testifies to a fresh outburst of vital energy, had been viewed from of oldas the time when the world was annually created afresh in the resurrection of a god, nothingcould be more natural than to place the resurrection of the new deity at the same cardinalpoint of the year. Only it is to be observed that if the death of Christ was dated on the twenty-fifth of March, his resurrection, according to Christian tradition, must have happened on thetwenty-seventh of March, which is just two days later than the vernal equinox of the Juliancalendar and the resurrection of Attis. A similar displacement of two days in the adjustment ofChristian to heathen celebrations occurs in the festivals of St. George and the Assumption ofthe Virgin. However, another Christian tradition, followed by Lactantius and perhaps by thepractice of the Church in Gaul, placed the death of Christ on the twenty-third and his resur-rection on the twenty-fifth of March. If that was so, his resurrection coincided exactly with theresurrection of Attis.In point of fact it appears from the testimony of an anonymous Christian, who wrote in thefourth century of our era, that Christians and pagans alike were struck by the remarkablecoincidence between the death and resurrection of their respective deities, and that the coin-cidence formed a theme of bitter controversy between the adherents of the rival religions, thepagans contending that the resurrection of Christ was a spurious imitation of the resurrectionof Attis, and the Christians asserting with equal warmth that the resurrection of Attis was adiabolical counterfeit of the resurrection of Christ. In these unseemly bickerings the heathentook what to a superficial observer might seem strong ground by arguing that their god wasthe older and therefore presumably the original, not the counterfeit, since as a general rule anoriginal is older than its copy. This feeble argument the Christians easily rebutted. Theyadmitted, indeed, that in point of time Christ was the junior deity, but they triumphantlydemonstrated his real seniority by falling back on the subtlety of Satan, who on so importantan occasion had surpassed himself by inverting the usual order ofnature.Taken altogether, the coincidences of the Christian with the heathen festivals are too closeand too numerous to be accidental. They mark the compromise which the Church in the hourof its triumph was compelled to make with its vanquished yet still dangerous rivals. The inflex-ible Protestantism of the primitive missionaries, with their fiery denunciations of heathendom,had been exchanged for the supple policy, the easy tolerance, the comprehensive charity ofshrewd ecclesiastics, who clearly perceived that if Christianity was to conquer the world itcould do so only by relaxing the too rigid principles of its Founder, by widening a little the nar-row gate which leads to salvation. In this respect an instructive parallel might be drawnbetween the history of Christianity and the history of Buddhism. Both systems were in theirorigin essentially ethical reforms born of the generous ardour, the lofty aspirations, the tenderPage 281"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"compassion of their noble Founders, two of those beautiful spirits who appear at rare inter-vals on earth like beings come from a better world to support and guide our weak and erringnature. Both preached moral virtue as the means of accomplishing what they regarded as thesupreme object of life, the eternal salvation of the individual soul, though by a curious antithe-sis the one sought that salvation in a blissful eternity, the other in a final release from suffer-ing, in annihilation. But the austere ideals of sanctity which they inculcated were too deeplyopposed not only to the frailties but to the natural instincts of humanity ever to be carried outin practice by more than a small number of disciples, who consistently renounced the ties ofthe family and the state in order to work out their own salvation in the still seclusion of thecloister. If such faiths were to be nominally accepted by whole nations or even by the world, itwas essential that they should first be modified or transformed so as to accord in some meas-ure with the prejudices, the passions, the superstitions of the vulgar. This process of accom-modation was carried out in after ages by followers who, made of less ethereal stuff than theirmasters, were for that reason the better fitted to mediate between them and the commonherd. Thus as time went on, the two religions, in exact proportion to their growing popularity,absorbed more and more of those baser elements which they had been instituted for the verypurpose of suppressing. Such spiritual decadences are inevitable. The world cannot live atthe level of its great men. Yet it would be unfair to the generality of our kind to ascribe whollyto their intellectual and moral weakness the gradual divergence of Buddhism and Christianityfrom their primitive patterns. For it should never be forgotten that by their glorification ofpoverty and celibacy both these religions struck straight at the root not merely of civil societybut of human existence. The blow was parried by the wisdom or the folly of the vast majorityof mankind, who refused to purchase a chance of saving their souls with the certainty ofextinguishing the species.Chapter XXXVIIIThe Myth of OsirisIN ancient Egypt the god whose death and resurrection were annually celebrated with alter-nate sorrow and joy was Osiris, the most popular of all Egyptian deities; and there are goodgrounds for classing him in one of his aspects with Adonis and Attis as a personification of thegreat yearly vicissitudes of nature, especially of the corn. But the immense vogue which heenjoyed for many ages induced his devoted worshippers to heap upon him the attributes andpowers of many other gods; so that it is not always easy to strip him, so to say, of his bor-rowed plumes and to restore them to their proper owners.The story of Osiris is told in a connected form only by Plutarch, whose narrative has beenconfirmed and to some extent amplified in modern times by the evidence of the monuments.Osiris was the offspring of an intrigue between the earth-god Seb (Keb or Geb, as the nameis sometimes transliterated) and the sky-goddess Nut. The Greeks identified his parents withtheir own deities Cronus and Rhea. When the sun-god Ra perceived that his wife Nut hadbeen unfaithful to him, he declared with a curse that she should be delivered of the child in nomonth and no year. But the goddess had another lover, the god Thoth or Hermes, as theGreeks called him, and he playing at draughts with the moon won from her a seventy-secondpart of every day, and having compounded five whole days out of these parts he added themto the Egyptian year of three hundred and sixty days. This was the mythical origin of the fivesupplementary days which the Egyptians annually inserted at the end of every year in orderto establish a harmony between lunar and solar time. On these five days, regarded as outsidethe year of twelve months, the curse of the sun-god did not rest, and accordingly Osiris wasPage 282"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"born on the first of them. At his nativity a voice rang out proclaiming that the Lord of All hadcome into the world. Some say that a certain Pamyles heard a voice from the temple atThebes bidding him announce with a shout that a great king, the beneficent Osiris, was born.But Osiris was not the only child of his mother. On the second of the supplementary days shegave birth to the elder Horus, on the third to the god Set, whom the Greeks called Typhon, onthe fourth to the goddess Isis, and on the fifth to the goddess Nephthys. Afterwards Set mar-ried his sister Nephthys, and Osiris married his sister Isis.Reigning as a king on earth, Osiris reclaimed the Egyptians from savagery, gave them laws,and taught them to worship the gods. Before his time the Egyptians had been cannibals. ButIsis, the sister and wife of Osiris, discovered wheat and barley growing wild, and Osiris intro-duced the cultivation of these grains amongst his people, who forthwith abandoned cannibal-ism and took kindly to a corn diet. Moreover, Osiris is said to have been the first to gather fruitfrom trees, to train the vine to poles, and to tread the grapes. Eager to communicate thesebeneficent discoveries to all mankind, he committed the whole government of Egypt to hiswife Isis, and travelled over the world, diffusing the blessings of civilisation and agriculturewherever he went. In countries where a harsh climate or niggardly soil forbade the cultivationof the vine, he taught the inhabitants to console themselves for the want of wine by brewingbeer from barley. Loaded with the wealth that had been showered upon him by gratefulnations, he returned to Egypt, and on account of the benefits he had conferred on mankindhe was unanimously hailed and worshipped as a deity. But his brother Set (whom the Greekscalled Typhon) with seventy-two others plotted against him. Having taken the measure of hisgood brother’s body by stealth, the bad brother Typhon fashioned and highly decorated a cof-fer of the same size, and once when they were all drinking and making merry he brought inthe coffer and jestingly promised to give it to the one whom it should fit exactly. Well, they alltried one after the other, but it fitted none of them. Last of all Osiris stepped into it and laydown. On that the conspirators ran and slammed the lid down on him, nailed it fast, solderedit with molten lead, and flung the coffer into the Nile. This happened on the seventeenth dayof the month Athyr, when the sun is in the sign of the Scorpion, and in the eight-and-twentiethyear of the reign or the life of Osiris. When Isis heard of it she sheared off a lock of her hair,put on a mourning attire, and wandered disconsolately up and down, seeking the body.By the advice of the god of wisdom she took refuge in the papyrus swamps of the Delta.Seven scorpions accompanied her in her flight. One evening when she was weary she cameto the house of a woman, who, alarmed at the sight of the scorpions, shut the door in herface. Then one of the scorpions crept under the door and stung the child of the woman thathe died. But when Isis heard the mother’s lamentation, her heart was touched, and she laidher hands on the child and uttered her powerful spells; so the poison was driven out of thechild and he lived. Afterwards Isis herself gave birth to a son in the swamps. She had con-ceived him while she fluttered in the form of a hawk over the corpse of her dead husband.The infant was the younger Horus, who in his youth bore the name of Harpocrates, that is,the child Horus. Him Buto, the goddess of the north, hid from the wrath of his wicked uncleSet. Yet she could not guard him from all mishap; for one day when Isis came to her littleson’s hiding-place she found him stretched lifeless and rigid on the ground: a scorpion hadstung him. Then Isis prayed to the sun-god Ra for help. The god hearkened to her and staidhis bark in the sky, and sent down Thoth to teach her the spell by which she might restore herson to life. She uttered the words of power, and straightway the poison flowed from the bodyof Horus, air passed into him, and he lived. Then Thoth ascended up into the sky and took hisplace once more in the bark of the sun, and the bright pomp passed onward jubilant.Page 283"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Meantime the coffer containing the body of Osiris had floated down the river and away out tosea, till at last it drifted ashore at Byblus, on the coast of Syria. Here a fine erica-tree shot upsuddenly and enclosed the chest in its trunk. The king of the country, admiring the growth ofthe tree, had it cut down and made into a pillar of his house; but he did not know that the cof-fer with the dead Osiris was in it. Word of this came to Isis and she journeyed to Byblus, andsat down by the well, in humble guise, her face wet with tears. To none would she speak tillthe king’s handmaidens came, and them she greeted kindly, and braided their hair, andbreathed on them from her own divine body a wondrous perfume. But when the queen beheldthe braids of her handmaidens’ hair and smelt the sweet smell that emanated from them, shesent for the stranger woman and took her into her house and made her the nurse of her child.But Isis gave the babe her finger instead of her breast to suck, and at night she began toburn all that was mortal of him away, while she herself in the likeness of a swallow flutteredround the pillar that contained her dead brother, twittering mournfully. But the queen spiedwhat she was doing and shrieked out when she saw her child in flames, and thereby she hin-dered him from becoming immortal. Then the goddess revealed herself and begged for thepillar of the roof, and they gave it her, and she cut the coffer out of it, and fell upon it andembraced it and lamented so loud that the younger of the king’s children died of fright on thespot. But the trunk of the tree she wrapped in fine linen, and poured ointment on it, and gaveit to the king and queen, and the wood stands in a temple of Isis and is worshipped by thepeople of Byblus to this day. And Isis put the coffer in a boat and took the eldest of the king’schildren with her and sailed away. As soon as they were alone, she opened the chest, andlaying her face on the face of her brother she kissed him and wept. But the child came behindher softly and saw what she was about, and she turned and looked at him in anger, and thechild could not bear her look and died; but some say that it was not so, but that he fell intothe sea and was drowned. It is he whom the Egyptians sing of at their banquets under thename of Maneros.But Isis put the coffer by and went to see her son Horus at the city of Buto, and Typhon foundthe coffer as he was hunting a boar one night by the light of a full moon. And he knew thebody, and rent it into fourteen pieces, and scattered them abroad. But Isis sailed up and downthe marshes in a shallop made of papyrus, looking for the pieces; and that is why when peo-ple sail in shallops made of papyrus, the crocodiles do not hurt them, for they fear or respectthe goddess. And that is the reason, too, why there are many graves of Osiris in Egypt, forshe buried each limb as she found it. But others will have it that she buried an image of himin every city, pretending it was his body, in order that Osiris might be worshipped in manyplaces, and that if Typhon searched for the real grave he might not be able to find it.However, the genital member of Osiris had been eaten by the fishes, so Isis made an imageof it instead, and the image is used by the Egyptians at their festivals to this day. “Isis,” writesthe historian Diodorus Siculus, “recovered all the parts of the body except the genitals; andbecause she wished that her husband’s grave should be unknown and honoured by all whodwell in the land of Egypt, she resorted to the following device. She moulded human imagesout of wax and spices, corresponding to the stature of Osiris, round each one of the parts ofhis body. Then she called in the priests according to their families and took an oath of themall that they would reveal to no man the trust she was about to repose in them. So to each ofthem privately she said that to them alone she entrusted the burial of the body, and remindingthem of the benefits they had received she exhorted them to bury the body in their own landand to honour Osiris as a god. She also besought them to dedicate one of the animals oftheir country, whichever they chose, and to honour it in life as they had formerly honouredOsiris, and when it died to grant it obsequies like his. And because she would encourage thepriests in their own interest to bestow the aforesaid honours, she gave them a third part of thePage 284"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"land to be used by them in the service and worship of the gods. Accordingly it is said that thepriests, mindful of the benefits of Osiris desirous of gratifying the queen, and moved by theprospect of gain, carried out all the injunctions of Isis. Wherefore to this day each of thepriests imagines that Osiris is buried in his country, and they honour the beasts that wereconsecrated in the beginning, and when the animals die the priests renew at their burial themourning for Osiris. But the sacred bulls, the one called Apis and the other Mnevis, were ded-icated to Osiris, and it was ordained that they should be worshipped as gods in common byall the Egyptians, since these animals above all others had helped the discoverers of corn insowing the seed and procuring the universal benefits of agriculture.”Such is the myth or legend of Osiris, as told by Greek writers and eked out by more or lessfragmentary notices or allusions in native Egyptian literature. A long inscription in the templeat Denderah has preserved a list of the god’s graves, and other texts mention the parts of hisbody which were treasured as holy relics in each of the sanctuaries. Thus his heart was atAthribis, his backbone at Busiris, his neck at Letopolis, and his head at Memphis. As oftenhappens in such cases, some of his divine limbs were miraculously multiplied. His head, forexample, was at Abydos as well as at Memphis, and his legs, which were remarkably numer-ous, would have sufficed for several ordinary mortals. In this respect, however, Osiris wasnothing to St. Denys, of whom no less than seven heads, all equally genuine, are extant.According to native Egyptian accounts, which supplement that of Plutarch, when Isis hadfound the corpse of her husband Osiris, she and her sister Nephthys sat down beside it anduttered a lament which in after ages became the type of all Egyptian lamentations for thedead. “Come to thy house,” they wailed. “Come to thy house. O god On! come to thy house,thou who hast no foes. O fair youth, come to thy house, that thou mayest see me. I am thysister, whom thou lovest; thou shalt not part from me. O fair boy, come to thy house.... I seethee not, yet doth my heart yearn after thee and mine eyes desire thee. Come to her wholoves thee, who loves thee, Unnefer, thou blessed one! Come to thy sister, come to thy wife,to thy wife, thou whose heart stands still. Come to thy housewife. I am thy sister by the samemother, thou shalt not be far from me. Gods and men have turned their faces towards theeand weep for thee together.... I call after thee and weep, so that my cry is heard to heaven,but thou hearest not my voice; yet am I thy sister, whom thou didst love on earth; thou didstlove none but me, my brother! my brother!” This lament for the fair youth cut off in his primereminds us of the laments for Adonis. The title of Unnefer or “the Good Being” bestowed onhim marks the beneficence which tradition universally ascribed to Osiris; it was at once hiscommonest title and one of his names as king.The lamentations of the two sad sisters were not in vain. In pity for her sorrow the sun-godRa sent down from heaven the jackal-headed god Anubis, who, with the aid of Isis andNephthys, of Thoth and Horus, pieced together the broken body of the murdered god,swathed it in linen bandages, and observed all the other rites which the Egyptians were wontto perform over the bodies of the departed. Then Isis fanned the cold clay with her wings:Osiris revived, and thenceforth reigned as king over the dead in the other world. There hebore the titles of Lord of the Underworld, Lord of Eternity, Ruler of the Dead. There, too, in thegreat Hall of the Two Truths, assisted by forty-two assessors, one from each of the principaldistricts of Egypt, he presided as judge at the trial of the souls of the departed, who madetheir solemn confession before him, and, their heart having been weighed in the balance ofjustice, received the reward of virtue in a life eternal or the appropriate punishment of theirsins.Page 285"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"In the resurrection of Osiris the Egyptians saw the pledge of a life everlasting for themselvesbeyond the grave. They believed that every man would live eternally in the other world if onlyhis surviving friends did for his body what the gods had done for the body of Osiris. Hencethe ceremonies observed by the Egyptians over the human dead were an exact copy of thosewhich Anubis, Horus, and the rest had performed over the dead god. “At every burial therewas enacted a representation of the divine mystery which had been performed of old overOsiris, when his son, his sisters, his friends were gathered round his mangled remains andsucceeded by their spells and manipulations in converting his broken body into the firstmummy, which they afterwards reanimated and furnished with the means of entering on anew individual life beyond the grave. The mummy of the deceased was Osiris; the profession-al female mourners were his two sisters Isis and Nephthys; Anubis, Horus, all the gods of theOsirian legend gathered about the corpse.” In this way every dead Egyptian was identifiedwith Osiris and bore his name. From the Middle Kingdom onwards it was the regular practiceto address the deceased as “Osiris So-and-So,” as if he were the god himself, and to add thestanding epithet “true of speech,” because true speech was characteristic of Osiris. The thou-sands of inscribed and pictured tombs that have been opened in the valley of the Nile provethat the mystery of the resurrection was performed for the benefit of every dead Egyptian; asOsiris died and rose again from the dead, so all men hoped to arise like him from death to lifeeternal.Thus according to what seems to have been the general native tradition Osiris was a goodand beloved king of Egypt, who suffered a violent death but rose from the dead and washenceforth worshipped as a deity. In harmony with this tradition he was regularly representedby sculptors and painters in human and regal form as a dead king, swathed in the wrappingsof a mummy, but wearing on his head a kingly crown and grasping in one of his hands, whichwere left free from the bandages, a kingly sceptre. Two cities above all others were associat-ed with his myth or memory. One of them was Busiris in Lower Egypt, which claimed to pos-sess his backbone; the other was Abydos in Upper Egypt, which gloried in the possession ofhis head. Encircled by the nimbus of the dead yet living god, Abydos, originally an obscureplace, became from the end of the Old Kingdom the holiest spot in Egypt; his tomb therewould seem to have been to the Egyptians what the Church of the Holy Sepulchre atJerusalem is to Christians. It was the wish of every pious man that his dead body should restin hallowed earth near the grave of the glorified Osiris. Few indeed were rich enough to enjoythis inestimable privilege; for, apart from the cost of a tomb in the sacred city, the mere trans-port of mummies from great distances was both difficult and expensive. Yet so eager weremany to absorb in death the blessed influence which radiated from the holy sepulchre thatthey caused their surviving friends to convey their mortal remains to Abydos, there to tarry fora short time, and then to be brought back by river and interred in the tombs which had beenmade ready for them in their native land. Others had cenotaphs built or memorial tabletserected for themselves near the tomb of their dead and risen Lord, that they might share withhim the bliss of a joyful resurrection.Chapter XXXIXThe Ritual of Osiris1. THE POPULAR RITESAUSEFUL clue to the original nature of a god or goddess is often furnished by the season atwhich his or her festival is celebrated. Thus, if the festival falls at the new or the full moon,there is a certain presumption that the deity thus honoured either is the moon or at least hasPage 286"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"lunar affinities. If the festival is held at the winter or summer solstice, we naturally surmisethat the god is the sun, or at all events that he stands in some close relation to that luminary.Again, if the festival coincides with the time of sowing or harvest, we are inclined to infer thatthe divinity is an embodiment of the earth or of the corn. These presumptions or inferences,taken by themselves, are by no means conclusive; but if they happen to be confirmed byother indications, the evidence may be regarded as fairly strong.Unfortunately, in dealing with the Egyptian gods we are in a great measure precluded frommaking use of this clue. The reason is not that the dates of the festivals are always unknown,but that they shifted from year to year, until after a long interval they had revolved through thewhole course of the seasons. This gradual revolution of the festal Egyptian cycle resultedfrom the employment of a calendar year which neither corresponded exactly to the solar yearnor was periodically corrected by intercalation.If the Egyptian farmer of the olden time could get no help, except at the rarest intervals, fromthe official or sacerdotal calendar, he must have been compelled to observe for himself thosenatural signals which marked the times for the various operations of husbandry. In all ages ofwhich we possess any records the Egyptians have been an agricultural people, dependent fortheir subsistence on the growth of the corn. The cereals which they cultivated were wheat,barley, and apparently sorghum (Holcus sorghum, Linnaeus), the doora of the modern fella-heen. Then as now the whole country, with the exception of a fringe on the coast of theMediterranean, was almost rainless, and owed its immense fertility entirely to the annual inun-dation of the Nile, which, regulated by an elaborate system of dams and canals, was distrib-uted over the fields, renewing the soil year by year with a fresh deposit of mud washed downfrom the great equatorial lakes and the mountains of Abyssinia. Hence the rise of the riverhas always been watched by the inhabitants with the utmost anxiety; for if it either falls shortof or exceeds a certain height, dearth and famine are the inevitable consequences. The waterbegins to rise early in June, but it is not until the latter half of July that it swells to a mightytide. By the end of September the inundation is at its greatest height. The country is now sub-merged, and presents the appearance of a sea of turbid water, from which the towns and vil-lages, built on higher ground, rise like islands. For about a month the flood remains nearlystationary, then sinks more and more rapidly, till by December or January the river hasreturned to its ordinary bed. With the approach of summer the level of the water continues tofall. In the early days of June the Nile is reduced to half its ordinary breadth; and Egypt,scorched by the sun, blasted by the wind that has blown from the Sahara for many days,seems a mere continuation of the desert. The trees are choked with a thick layer of grey dust.Afew meagre patches of vegetables, watered with difficulty, struggle painfully for existence inthe immediate neighbourhood of the villages. Some appearance of verdure lingers beside thecanals and in the hollows from which the moisture has not wholly evaporated. The plainappears to pant in the pitiless sunshine, bare, dusty, ash-coloured, cracked and seamed asfar as the eye can see with a network of fissures. From the middle of April till the middle ofJune the land of Egypt is but half alive, waiting for the new Nile.For countless ages this cycle of natural events has determined the annual labours of theEgyptian husbandman. The first work of the agricultural year is the cutting of the dams whichhave hitherto prevented the swollen river from flooding the canals and the fields. This is done,and the pent-up waters released on their beneficent mission, in the first half of August. InNovember, when the inundation has subsided, wheat, barley, and sorghum are sown. Thetime of harvest varies with the district, falling about a month later in the north than in thesouth. In Upper or Southern Egypt barley is reaped at the beginning of March, wheat at thePage 287"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"beginning of April, and sorghum about the end of that month.It is natural to suppose that the various events of the agricultural year were celebrated by theEgyptian farmer with some simple religious rites designed to secure the blessing of the godsupon his labours. These rustic ceremonies he would continue to perform year after year atthe same season, while the solemn festivals of the priests continued to shift, with the shiftingcalendar, from summer through spring to winter, and so backward through autumn to sum-mer. The rites of the husbandman were stable because they rested on direct observation ofnature: the rites of the priest were unstable because they were based on a false calculation.Yet many of the priestly festivals may have been nothing but the old rural festivals disguisedin the course of ages by the pomp of sacerdotalism and severed, by the error of the calendar,from their roots in the natural cycle of the seasons.These conjectures are confirmed by the little we know both of the popular and of the officialEgyptian religion. Thus we are told that the Egyptians held a festival of Isis at the time whenthe Nile began to rise. They believed that the goddess was then mourning for the lost Osiris,and that the tears which dropped from her eyes swelled the impetuous tide of the river. Now ifOsiris was in one of his aspects a god of the corn, nothing could be more natural than that heshould be mourned at midsummer. For by that time the harvest was past, the fields werebare, the river ran low, life seemed to be suspended, the corn-god was dead. At such amoment people who saw the handiwork of divine beings in all the operations of nature mightwell trace the swelling of the sacred stream to the tears shed by the goddess at the death ofthe beneficent corn-god her husband.And the sign of the rising waters on earth was accompanied by a sign in heaven. For in theearly days of Egyptian history, some three or four thousand years before the beginning of ourera, the splendid star of Sirius, the brightest of all the fixed stars, appeared at dawn in theeast just before sunrise about the time of the summer solstice, when the Nile begins to rise.The Egyptians called it Sothis, and regarded it as the star of Isis, just as the Babyloniansdeemed the planet Venus the star of Astarte. To both peoples apparently the brilliant luminaryin the morning sky seemed the goddess of life and love come to mourn her departed lover orspouse and to wake him from the dead. Hence the rising of Sirius marked the beginning ofthe sacred Egyptian year, and was regularly celebrated by a festival which did not shift withthe shifting official year.The cutting of the dams and the admission of the water into the canals and fields is a greatevent in the Egyptian year. At Cairo the operation generally takes place between the sixth andthe sixteenth of August, and till lately was attended by ceremonies which deserve to benoticed, because they were probably handed down from antiquity. An ancient canal, known bythe name of the Khalíj, formerly passed through the native town of Cairo. Near its entrancethe canal was crossed by a dam of earth, very broad at the bottom and diminishing in breadthupwards, which used to be constructed before or soon after the Nile began to rise. In front ofthe dam, on the side of the river, was reared a truncated cone of earth called the ‘arooseh or“bride,” on the top of which a little maize or millet was generally sown. This “bride” was com-monly washed down by the rising tide a week or a fortnight before the cutting of the dam.Tradition runs that the old custom was to deck a young virgin in gay apparel and throw herinto the river as a sacrifice to obtain a plentiful inundation. Whether that was so or not, theintention of the practice appears to have been to marry the river, conceived as a male power,to his bride the cornland, which was so soon to be fertilised by his water. The ceremony wastherefore a charm to ensure the growth of the crops. In modern times money used to bePage 288"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"thrown into the canal on this occasion, and the populace dived into the water after it. Thispractice also would seem to have been ancient, for Seneca tells us that at a place called theVeins of the Nile, not far from Philae, the priests used to cast money and offerings of gold intothe river at a festival which apparently took place at the rising of the water.The next great operation of the agricultural year in Egypt is the sowing of the seed inNovember, when the water of the inundation has retreated from the fields. With theEgyptians, as with many peoples of antiquity, the committing of the seed to the earthassumed the character of a solemn and mournful rite. On this subject I will let Plutarch speakfor himself. “What,” he asks, “are we to make of the gloomy, joyless, and mournful sacrifices,if it is wrong either to omit the established rites or to confuse and disturb our conceptions ofthe gods by absurd suspicions? For the Greeks also perform many rites which resemblethose of the Egyptians and are observed about the same time. Thus at the festival of theThesmophoria in Athens women sit on the ground and fast. And the Boeotians open thevaults of the Sorrowful One, naming that festival sorrowful because Demeter is sorrowing forthe descent of the Maiden. The month is the month of sowing about the setting of thePleiades. The Egyptians call it Athyr, the Athenians Pyanepsion, the Boeotians the month ofDemeter.... For it was that time of year when they saw some of the fruits vanishing and failingfrom the trees, while they sowed others grudgingly and with difficulty, scraping the earth withtheir hands and huddling it up again, on the uncertain chance that what they deposited in theground would ever ripen and come to maturity. Thus they did in many respects like those whobury and mourn their dead.”The Egyptian harvest, as we have seen, falls not in autumn but in spring, in the months ofMarch, April, and May. To the husbandman the time of harvest, at least in a good year, mustnecessarily be a season of joy: in bringing home his sheaves he is requited for his long andanxious labours. Yet if the old Egyptian farmer felt a secret joy at reaping and garnering thegrain, it was essential that he should conceal the natural emotion under an air of profounddejection. For was he not severing the body of the corn-god with his sickle and trampling it topieces under the hoofs of his cattle on the threshing-floor? Accordingly we are told that it wasan ancient custom of the Egyptian corn-reapers to beat their breasts and lament over the firstsheaf cut, while at the same time they called upon Isis. The invocation seems to have takenthe form of a melancholy chant, to which the Greeks gave the name of Maneros. Similarplaintive strains were chanted by corn-reapers in Phoenicia and other parts of Western Asia.Probably all these doleful ditties were lamentations for the corn-god killed by the sickles of thereapers. In Egypt the slain deity was Osiris, and the name Maneros, applied to the dirge,appears to be derived from certain words meaning “Come to thy house,” which often occur inthe lamentations for the dead god.Ceremonies of the same sort have been observed by other peoples, probably for the samepurpose. Thus we are told that among all vegetables corn, by which is apparently meantmaize, holds the first place in the household economy and the ceremonial observance of theCherokee Indians, who invoke it under the name of “the Old Woman” in allusion to a myththat it sprang from the blood of an old woman killed by her disobedient sons. After the lastworking of the crop a priest and his assistant went into the field and sang songs of invocationto the spirit of the corn. After that a loud rustling would be heard, which was thought to becaused by the Old Woman bringing the corn into the field. A clean trail was always kept fromthe field to the house, “so that the corn might be encouraged to stay at home and not go wan-dering elsewhere.” “Another curious ceremony, of which even the memory is now almost for-gotten, was enacted after the first working of the corn, when the owner or priest stood in suc-Page 289"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"cession at each of the four corners of the field and wept and wailed loudly. Even the priestsare now unable to give a reason for this performance, which may have been a lament for thebloody death of Selu,” the Old Woman of the Corn. In these Cherokee practices the lamenta-tions and the invocations of the Old Woman of the Corn resemble the ancient Egyptian cus-toms of lamenting over the first corn cut and calling upon Isis, herself probably in one of heraspects an Old Woman of the Corn. Further, the Cherokee precaution of leaving a clear pathfrom the field to the house resembles the Egyptian invitation to Osiris, “Come to thy house.”So in the East Indies to this day people observe elaborate ceremonies for the purpose ofbringing back the Soul of the Rice from the fields to the barn. The Nandi of East Africa per-form a ceremony in September when the eleusine grain is ripening. Every woman who ownsa plantation goes out with her daughters into the cornfields and makes a bonfire of thebranches and leaves of certain trees. After that they pluck some of the eleusine, and each ofthem puts one grain in her necklace, chews another and rubs it on her forehead, throat, andbreast. “No joy is shown by the womenfolk on this occasion, and they sorrowfully cut a bas-ketful of the corn which they take home with them and place in the loft to dry.”The conception of the corn-spirit as old and dead at harvest is very clearly embodied in acustom observed by the Arabs of Moab. When the harvesters have nearly finished their taskand only a small corner of the field remains to be reaped, the owner takes a handful of wheattied up in a sheaf. A hole is dug in the form of a grave, and two stones are set upright, one atthe head and the other at the foot, just as in an ordinary burial. Then the sheaf of wheat islaid at the bottom of the grave, and the sheikh pronounces these words, ‘The old man isdead.” Earth is afterwards thrown in to cover the sheaf, with a prayer, “May Allah bring usback the wheat of the dead.”2. THE OFFICIAL RITESSUCH, then, were the principal events of the farmer’s calendar in ancient Egypt, and suchthe simple religious rites by which he celebrated them. But we have still to consider theOsirian festivals of the official calendar, so far as these are described by Greek writers orrecorded on the monuments. In examining them it is necessary to bear in mind that onaccount of the movable year of the old Egyptian calendar the true or astronomical dates ofthe official festivals must have varied from year to year, at least until the adoption of the fixedAlexandrian year in 30 B.C. From that time onward, apparently, the dates of the festivals weredetermined by the new calendar, and so ceased to rotate throughout the length of the solaryear. At all events Plutarch, writing about the end of the first century, implies that they werethen fixed, not movable; for though he does not mention the Alexandrian calendar, he clearlydates the festivals by it. Moreover, the long festal calendar of Esne, an important document ofthe Imperial age, is obviously based on the fixed Alexandrian year; for it assigns the mark forNew Year’s Day to the day which corresponds to the twenty-ninth of August, which was thefirst day of the Alexandrian year, and its references to the rising of the Nile, the position of thesun, and the operations of agriculture are all in harmony with this supposition. Thus we maytake it as fairly certain that from 30 B.C. onwards the Egyptian festivals were stationary in thesolar year.Herodotus tells us that the grave of Osiris was at Sais in Lower Egypt, and that there was alake there upon which the sufferings of the god were displayed as a mystery by night. Thiscommemoration of the divine passion was held once a year: the people mourned and beattheir breasts at it to testify their sorrow for the death of the god; and an image of a cow, madeof gilt wood with a golden sun between its horns, was carried out of the chamber in which itPage 290"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"stood the rest of the year. The cow no doubt represented Isis herself, for cows were sacred toher, and she was regularly depicted with the horns of a cow on her head, or even as awoman with the head of a cow. It is probable that the carrying out of her cow-shaped imagesymbolised the goddess searching for the dead body of Osiris; for this was the nativeEgyptian interpretation of a similar ceremony observed in Plutarch’s time about the winter sol-stice, when the gilt cow was carried seven times round the temple. A great feature of the festi-val was the nocturnal illumination. People fastened rows of oil-lamps to the outside of theirhouses, and the lamps burned all night long. The custom was not confined to Sais, but wasobserved throughout the whole of Egypt.This universal illumination of the houses on one night of the year suggests that the festivalmay have been a commemoration not merely of the dead Osiris but of the dead in general, inother words, that it may have been a night of All Souls. For it is a widespread belief that thesouls of the dead revisit their old homes on one night of the year; and on that solemn occa-sion people prepare for the reception of the ghosts by laying out food for them to eat, andlighting lamps to guide them on their dark road from and to the grave. Herodotus, who brieflydescribes the festival, omits to mention its date, but we can determine it with some probabilityfrom other sources. Thus Plutarch tells us that Osiris was murdered on the seventeenth of themonth Athyr, and that the Egyptians accordingly observed mournful rites for four days fromthe seventeenth of Athyr. Now in the Alexandrian calendar, which Plutarch used, these fourdays corresponded to the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth of November, and thisdate answers exactly to the other indications given by Plutarch, who says that at the time ofthe festival the Nile was sinking, the north winds dying away, the nights lengthening, and theleaves falling from the trees. During these four days a gilt cow swathed in a black pall wasexhibited as an image of Isis. This, no doubt, was the image mentioned by Herodotus in hisaccount of the festival. On the nineteenth day of the month the people went down to the sea,the priests carrying a shrine which contained a golden casket. Into this casket they pouredfresh water, and thereupon the spectators raised a shout that Osiris was found. After that theytook some vegetable mould, moistened it with water, mixed it with precious spices andincense, and moulded the paste into a small moon-shaped image, which was then robed andornamented. Thus it appears that the purpose of the ceremonies described by Plutarch wasto represent dramatically, first, the search for the dead body of Osiris, and, second, its joyfuldiscovery, followed by the resurrection of the dead god who came to life again in the newimage of vegetable mould and spices. Lactantius tells us how on these occasions the priests,with their shaven bodies, beat their breasts and lamented, imitating the sorrowful search ofIsis for her lost son Osiris, and how afterwards their sorrow was turned to joy when the jackal-headed god Anubis, or rather a mummer in his stead, produced a small boy, the living repre-sentative of the god who was lost and was found. Thus Lactantius regarded Osiris as the soninstead of the husband of Isis, and he makes no mention of the image of vegetable mould. Itis probable that the boy who figured in the sacred drama played the part, not of Osiris, but ofhis son Horus; but as the death and resurrection of the god were celebrated in many cities ofEgypt, it is also possible that in some places the part of the god come to life was played by aliving actor instead of by an image. Another Christian writer describes how the Egyptians, withshorn heads, annually lamented over a buried idol of Osiris, smiting their breasts, slashingtheir shoulders, ripping open their old wounds, until, after several days of mourning, they pro-fessed to find the mangled remains of the god, at which they rejoiced. However the details ofthe ceremony may have varied in different places, the pretence of finding the god’s body, andprobably of restoring it to life, was a great event in the festal year of the Egyptians. Theshouts of joy which greeted it are described or alluded to by many ancient writers.Page 291"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"The funeral rites of Osiris, as they were observed at his great festival in the sixteen provincesof Egypt, are described in a long inscription of the Ptolemaic period, which is engraved on thewalls of the god’s temple at Denderah, the Tentyra of the Greeks, a town of Upper Egypt situ-ated on the western bank of the Nile about forty miles north of Thebes. Unfortunately, whilethe information thus furnished is remarkably full and minute on many points, the arrangementadopted in the inscription is so confused and the expression often so obscure that a clear andconsistent account of the ceremonies as a whole can hardly be extracted from it. Moreover,we learn from the document that the ceremonies varied somewhat in the several cities, theritual of Abydos, for example, differing from that of Busiris. Without attempting to trace all theparticularities of local usage I shall briefly indicate what seem to have been the leading fea-tures of the festival, so far as these can be ascertained with tolerable certainty.The rites lasted eighteen days, from the twelfth to the thirtieth of the month Khoiak, and setforth the nature of Osiris in his triple aspect as dead, dismembered, and finally reconstitutedby the union of his scattered limbs. In the first of these aspects he was called Chent-Ament(Khenti-Amenti), in the second Osiris-Sep, and in the third Sokari (Seker). Small images ofthe god were moulded of sand or vegetable earth and corn, to which incense was sometimesadded; his face was painted yellow and his cheek-bones green. These images were cast in amould of pure gold, which represented the god in the form of a mummy, with the white crownof Egypt on his head. The festival opened on the twelfth day of Khoiak with a ceremony ofploughing and sowing. Two black cows were yoked to the plough, which was made oftamarisk wood, while the share was of black copper. A boy scattered the seed. One end ofthe field was sown with barley, the other with spelt, and the middle with flax. During the oper-ation the chief celebrant recited the ritual chapter of “the sowing of the fields.” At Busiris onthe twentieth of Khoiak sand and barley were put in the god’s “garden,” which appears tohave been a sort of large flower-pot. This was done in the presence of the cow-goddessShenty, represented seemingly by the image of a cow made of gilt sycamore wood with aheadless human image in its inside. “Then fresh inundation water was poured out of a goldenvase over both the goddess and the ‘garden,’ and the barley was allowed to grow as theemblem of the resurrection of the god after his burial in the earth, ‘for the growth of the gar-den is the growth of the divine substance.’” On the twenty-second of Khoiak, at the eighthhour, the images of Osiris, attended by thirty-four images of deities, performed a mysteriousvoyage in thirty-four tiny boats made of papyrus, which were illuminated by three hundredand sixty-five lights. On the twenty-fourth of Khoiak, after sunset, the effigy of Osiris in a coffinof mulberry wood was laid in the grave, and at the ninth hour of the night the effigy which hadbeen made and deposited the year before was removed and placed upon boughs ofsycamore. Lastly, on the thirtieth day of Khoiak they repaired to the holy sepulchre, a subter-ranean chamber over which appears to have grown a clump of Persea-trees. Entering thevault by the western door, they laid the coffined effigy of the dead god reverently on a bed ofsand in the chamber. So they left him to his rest, and departed from the sepulchre by theeastern door. Thus ended the ceremonies in the month of Khoiak.In the foregoing account of the festival, drawn from the great inscription of Denderah, the bur-ial of Osiris figures prominently, while his resurrection is implied rather than expressed. Thisdefect of the document, however, is amply compensated by a remarkable series of bas-reliefswhich accompany and illustrate the inscription. These exhibit in a series of scenes the deadgod lying swathed as a mummy on his bier, then gradually raising himself up higher and high-er, until at last he has entirely quitted the bier and is seen erect between the guardian wingsof the faithful Isis, who stands behind him, while a male figure holds up before his eyes thecrux ansata, the Egyptian symbol of life. The resurrection of the god could hardly be por-Page 292"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"trayed more graphically. Even more instructive, however, is another representation of thesame event in a chamber dedicated to Osiris in the great temple of Isis at Philae. Here wesee the dead body of Osiris with stalks of corn springing from it, while a priest waters thestalks from a pitcher which he holds in his hand. The accompanying inscription sets forth that“this is the form of him whom one may not name, Osiris of the mysteries, who springs fromthe returning waters.” Taken together, the picture and the words seem to leave no doubt thatOsiris was here conceived and represented as a personification of the corn which springsfrom the fields after they have been fertilised by the inundation. This, according to the inscrip-tion, was the kernel of the mysteries, the innermost secret revealed to the initiated. So in therites of Demeter at Eleusis a reaped ear of corn was exhibited to the worshippers as the cen-tral mystery of their religion. We can now fully understand why at the great festival of sowingin the month of Khoiak the priests used to bury effigies of Osiris made of earth and corn.When these effigies were taken up again at the end of a year or of a shorter interval, the cornwould be found to have sprouted from the body of Osiris, and this sprouting of the grainwould be hailed as an omen, or rather as the cause, of the growth of the crops. The corn-godproduced the corn from himself: he gave his own body to feed the people: he died that theymight live.And from the death and resurrection of their great god the Egyptians drew not only their sup-port and sustenance in this life, but also their hope of a life eternal beyond the grave. Thishope is indicated in the clearest manner by the very remarkable effigies of Osiris which havecome to light in Egyptian cemeteries. Thus in the Valley of the Kings at Thebes there wasfound the tomb of a royal fan-bearer who lived about 1500 B.C. Among the rich contents ofthe tomb there was a bier on which rested a mattress of reeds covered with three layers oflinen. On the upper side of the linen was painted a life-size figure of Osiris; and the interior ofthe figure, which was waterproof, contained a mixture of vegetable mould, barley, and a stickyfluid. The barley had sprouted and sent out shoots two or three inches long. Again, in thecemetery at Cynopolis “were numerous burials of Osiris figures. These were made of grainwrapped up in cloth and roughly shaped like an Osiris, and placed inside a bricked-up recessat the side of the tomb, sometimes in small pottery coffins, sometimes in wooden coffins inthe form of a hawkmummy, sometimes without any coffins at all.” These corn-stuffed figureswere bandaged like mummies with patches of gilding here and there, as if in imitation of thegolden mould in which the similar figures of Osiris were cast at the festival of sowing. Again,effigies of Osiris, with faces of green wax and their interior full of grain, were found buriednear the necropolis of Thebes. Finally, we are told by Professor Erman that between the legsof mummies “there sometimes lies a figure of Osiris made of slime; it is filled with grains ofcorn, the sprouting of which is intended to signify the resurrection of the god.” We cannotdoubt that, just as the burial of corn-stuffed images of Osiris in the earth at the festival of sow-ing was designed to quicken the seed, so the burial of similar images in the grave was meantto quicken the dead, in other words, to ensure their spiritual immortality.Chapter XLThe Nature of Osiris1. OSIRIS A CORN-GODTHE foregoing survey of the myth and ritual of Osiris may suffice to prove that in one of hisaspects the god was a personification of the corn, which may be said to die and come to lifeagain every year. Through all the pomp and glamour with which in later times the priests hadinvested his worship, the conception of him as the corn-god comes clearly out in the festivalPage 293"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"of his death and resurrection, which was celebrated in the month of Khoiak and at a laterperiod in the month of Athyr. That festival appears to have been essentially a festival of sow-ing, which properly fell at the time when the husbandman actually committed the seed to theearth. On that occasion an effigy of the corn-god, moulded of earth and corn, was buried withfuneral rites in the ground in order that, dying there, he might come to life again with the newcrops. The ceremony was, in fact, a charm to ensure the growth of the corn by sympatheticmagic, and we may conjecture that as such it was practised in a simple form by everyEgyptian farmer on his fields long before it was adopted and transfigured by the priests in thestately ritual of the temple. In the modern, but doubtless ancient, Arab custom of burying “theOld Man,” namely, a sheaf of wheat, in the harvest-field and praying that he may return fromthe dead, we see the germ out of which the worship of the corn-god Osiris was probablydeveloped.The details of his myth fit in well with this interpretation of the god. He was said to be the off-spring of Sky and Earth. What more appropriate parentage could be invented for the cornwhich springs from the ground that has been fertilised by the water of heaven? It is true thatthe land of Egypt owed its fertility directly to the Nile and not to showers; but the inhabitantsmust have known or guessed that the great river in its turn was fed by the rains which fell inthe far interior. Again, the legend that Osiris was the first to teach men the use of corn wouldbe most naturally told of the corn-god himself. Further, the story that his mangled remainswere scattered up and down the land and buried in different places may be a mythical way ofexpressing either the sowing or the winnowing of the grain. The latter interpretation is sup-ported by the tale that Isis placed the severed limbs of Osiris on a corn-sieve. Or more proba-bly the legend may be a reminiscence of a custom of slaying a human victim, perhaps a rep-resentative of the corn-spirit, and distributing his flesh or scattering his ashes over the fieldsto fertilise them. In modern Europe the figure of Death is sometimes torn in pieces, and thefragments are then buried in the ground to make the crops grow well, and in other parts ofthe world human victims are treated in the same way. With regard to the ancient Egyptianswe have it on the authority of Manetho that they used to burn red-haired men and scattertheir ashes with winnowing fans, and it is highly significant that this barbarous sacrifice wasoffered by the kings at the grave of Osiris. We may conjecture that the victims representedOsiris himself, who was annually slain, dismembered, and buried in their persons that hemight quicken the seed in the earth.Possibly in prehistoric times the kings themselves played the part of the god and were slainand dismembered in that character. Set as well as Osiris is said to have been torn in piecesafter a reign of eighteen days, which was commemorated by an annual festival of the samelength. According to one story Romulus, the first king of Rome, was cut in pieces by the sen-ators, who buried the fragments of him in the ground; and the traditional day of his death, theseventh of July, was celebrated with certain curious rites, which were apparently connectedwith the artificial fertilisation of the fig. Again, Greek legend told how Pentheus, king ofThebes, and Lycurgus, king of the Thracian Edonians, opposed the vine-god Dionysus, andhow the impious monarchs were rent in pieces, the one by the frenzied Bacchanals, the otherby horses. The Greek traditions may well be distorted reminiscences of a custom of sacrific-ing human beings, and especially divine kings, in the character of Dionysus, a god whoresembled Osiris in many points and was said like him to have been torn limb from limb. Weare told that in Chios men were rent in pieces as a sacrifice to Dionysus; and since they diedthe same death as their god, it is reasonable to suppose that they personated him. The storythat the Thracian Orpheus was similarly torn limb from limb by the Bacchanals seems to indi-cate that he too perished in the character of the god whose death he died. It is significant thatPage 294"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"the Thracian Lycurgus, king of the Edonians, is said to have been put to death in order thatthe ground, which had ceased to be fruitful, might regain its fertility.Further, we read of a Norwegian king, Halfdan the Black, whose body was cut up and buriedin different parts of his kingdom for the sake of ensuring the fruitfulness of the earth. He issaid to have been drowned at the age of forty through the breaking of the ice in spring. Whatfollowed his death is thus related by the old Norse historian Snorri Sturluson: “He had beenthe most prosperous (literally, blessed with abundance) of all kings. So greatly did men valuehim that when the news came that he was dead and his body removed to Hringariki andintended for burial there, the chief men from Raumariki and Westfold and Heithmörk cameand all requested that they might take his body with them and bury it in their variousprovinces; they thought that it would bring abundance to those who obtained it. Eventually itwas settled that the body was distributed in four places. The head was laid in a barrow atSteinn in Hringariki, and each party took away their own share and buried it. All these bar-rows are called Halfdan’s barrows.” It should be remembered that this Halfdan belonged tothe family of the Ynglings, who traced their descent from Frey, the great Scandinavian god offertility.The natives of Kiwai, an island lying off the mouth of the Fly River in British New Guinea, tellof a certain magician named Segera, who had sago for his totem. When Segera was old andill, he told the people that he would soon die, but that, nevertheless, he would cause their gar-dens to thrive. Accordingly, he instructed them that when he was dead they should cut him upand place pieces of his flesh in their gardens, but his head was to be buried in his own gar-den. Of him it is said that he outlived the ordinary age, and that no man knew his father, butthat he made the sago good and no one was hungry any more. Old men who were alivesome years ago affirmed that they had known Segera in their youth, and the general opinionof the Kiwai people seems to be that Segera died not more than two generations ago.Taken all together, these legends point to a widespread practice of dismembering the body ofa king or magician and burying the pieces in different parts of the country in order to ensurethe fertility of the ground and probably also the fecundity of man and beast.To return to the human victims whose ashes the Egyptians scattered with winnowing-fans, thered hair of these unfortunates was probably significant. For in Egypt the oxen which weresacrificed had also to be red; a single black or white hair found on the beast would have dis-qualified it for the sacrifice. If, as I conjecture, these human sacrifices were intended to pro-mote the growth of the crops—and the winnowing of their ashes seems to support this view—redhaired victims were perhaps selected as best fitted to personate the spirit of the ruddygrain. For when a god is represented by a living person, it is natural that the human represen-tative should be chosen on the ground of his supposed resemblance to the divine original.Hence the ancient Mexicans, conceiving the maize as a personal being who went through thewhole course of life between seed-time and harvest, sacrificed new-born babes when themaize was sown, older children when it had sprouted, and so on till it was fully ripe, whenthey sacrificed old men. A name for Osiris was the “crop” or “harvest”; and the ancients some-times explained him as a personification of the corn.2. OSIRIS A TREE-SPIRITBut Osiris was more than a spirit of the corn; he was also a tree-spirit, and this may perhapshave been his primitive character, since the worship of trees is naturally older in the history ofPage 295"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"religion than the worship of the cereals. The character of Osiris as a tree-spirit was represent-ed very graphically in a ceremony described by Firmicus Maternus. A pine-tree having beencut down, the centre was hollowed out, and with the wood thus excavated an image of Osiriswas made, which was then buried like a corpse in the hollow of the tree. It is hard to imaginehow the conception of a tree as tenanted by a personal being could be more plainlyexpressed. The image of Osiris thus made was kept for a year and then burned, exactly aswas done with the image of Attis which was attached to the pine-tree. The ceremony of cut-ting the tree, as described by Firmicus Maternus, appears to be alluded to by Plutarch. It wasprobably the ritual counterpart of the mythical discovery of the body of Osiris enclosed in theerica-tree. In the hall of Osiris at Denderah the coffin containing the hawk-headed mummy ofthe god is clearly depicted as enclosed within a tree, apparently a conifer, the trunk andbranches of which are seen above and below the coffin. The scene thus corresponds closelyboth to the myth and to the ceremony described by Firmicus Maternus.It accords with the character of Osiris as a tree-spirit that his worshippers were forbidden toinjure fruit-trees, and with his character as a god of vegetation in general that they were notallowed to stop up wells of water, which are so important for the irrigation of hot southernlands. According to one legend, he taught men to train the vine to poles, to prune its superflu-ous foliage, and to extract the juice of the grape. In the papyrus of Nebseni, written about1550 B.C., Osiris is depicted sitting in a shrine, from the roof of which hang clusters ofgrapes; and in the papyrus of the royal scribe Nekht we see the god enthroned in front of apool, from the banks of which a luxuriant vine, with many bunches of grapes, grows towardsthe green face of the seated deity. The ivy was sacred to him, and was called his plantbecause it is always green.3. OSIRIS A GOD OF FERTILITYAs a god of vegetation Osiris was naturally conceived as a god of creative energy in general,since men at a certain stage of evolution fail to distinguish between the reproductive powersof animals and of plants. Hence a striking feature in his worship was the coarse but expres-sive symbolism by which this aspect of his nature was presented to the eye not merely of theinitiated but of the multitude. At his festival women used to go about the villages singingsongs in his praise and carrying obscene images of him which they set in motion by means ofstrings. The custom was probably a charm to ensure the growth of the crops. A similar imageof him, decked with all the fruits of the earth, is said to have stood in a temple before a figureof Isis, and in the chambers dedicated to him at Philae the dead god is portrayed lying on hisbier in an attitude which indicates in the plainest way that even in death his generative virtuewas not extinct but only suspended, ready to prove a source of life and fertility to the worldwhen the opportunity should offer. Hymns addressed to Osiris contain allusions to this impor-tant side of his nature. In one of them it is said that the world waxes green in triumph throughhim; and another declares, “Thou art the father and mother of mankind, they live on thybreath, they subsist on the flesh of thy body.” We may conjecture that in this paternal aspecthe was supposed, like other gods of fertility, to bless men and women with offspring, and thatthe processions at his festival were intended to promote this object as well as to quicken theseed in the ground. It would be to misjudge ancient religion to denounce as lewd and profli-gate the emblems and the ceremonies which the Egyptians employed for the purpose of giv-ing effect to this conception of the divine power. The ends which they proposed to themselvesin these rites were natural and laudable; only the means they adopted to compass them weremistaken. A similar fallacy induced the Greeks to adopt a like symbolism in their Dionysiacfestivals, and the superficial but striking resemblance thus produced between the two reli-Page 296"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"gions has perhaps more than anything else misled enquirers, both ancient and modern, intoidentifying worships which, though certainly akin in nature, are perfectly distinct and inde-pendent in origin.4. OSIRIS A GOD OF THE DEADWe have seen that in one of his aspects Osiris was the ruler and judge of the dead. To a peo-ple like the Egyptians, who not only believed in a life beyond the grave but actually spentmuch of their time, labour, and money in preparing for it, this office of the god must haveappeared hardly, if at all, less important than his function of making the earth to bring forth itsfruits in due season. We may assume that in the faith of his worshippers the two provinces ofthe god were intimately connected. In laying their dead in the grave they committed them tohis keeping who could raise them from the dust to life eternal, even as he caused the seed tospring from the ground. Of that faith the corn-stuffed effigies of Osiris found in Egyptian tombsfurnish an eloquent and un-equivocal testimony. They were at once an emblem and an instru-ment of resurrection. Thus from the sprouting of the grain the ancient Egyptians drew anaugury of human immortality. They are not the only people who have built the same loftyhopes on the same slender foundation.Agod who thus fed his people with his own broken body in this life, and who held out to thema promise of a blissful eternity in a better world hereafter, naturally reigned supreme in theiraffections. We need not wonder, therefore, that in Egypt the worship of the other gods wasovershadowed by that of Osiris, and that while they were revered each in his own district, heand his divine partner Isis were adored in all.Chapter XLIIsisTHE original meaning of the goddess Isis is still more difficult to determine than that of herbrother and husband Osiris. Her attributes and epithets were so numerous that in the hiero-glyphics she is called “the many-named,” “the thousand-named,” and in Greek inscriptions“the myriad-named.” Yet in her complex nature it is perhaps still possible to detect the originalnucleus round which by a slow process of accretion the other elements gathered. For if herbrother and husband Osiris was in one of his aspects the corn-god, as we have seen reasonto believe, she must surely have been the corn-goddess. There are at least some grounds forthinking so. For if we may trust Diodorus Siculus, whose authority appears to have been theEgyptian historian Manetho, the discovery of wheat and barley was attributed to Isis, and ather festivals stalks of these grains were carried in procession to commemorate the boon shehad conferred on men. A further detail is added by Augustine. He says that Isis made the dis-covery of barley at the moment when she was sacrificing to the common ancestors of herhusband and herself, all of whom had been kings, and that she showed the newly discoveredears of barley to Osiris and his councillor Thoth or Mercury, as Roman writers called him.That is why, adds Augustine, they identify Isis with Ceres. Further, at harvest-time, when theEgyptian reapers had cut the first stalks, they laid them down and beat their breasts, wailingand calling upon Isis. The custom has been already explained as a lamen for the corn-spiritslain under the sickle. Amongst the epithets by which Isis is designated in the inscriptions are“Creatress of green things,” “Green goddess, whose green colour is like unto the greennessof the earth,” “Lady of Bread,” “Lady of Beer,” “Lady of Abundance.” According to Brugsch sheis “not only the creatress of the fresh verdure of vegetation which covers the earth, but isactually the green corn-field itself, which is personified as a goddess.” This is confirmed byPage 297"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"her epithet Sochit or Sochet, meaning “a corn-field,” a sense which the word still retains inCoptic. The Greeks conceived of Isis as a corn-goddess, for they identified her with Demeter.In a Greek epigram she is described as “she who has given birth to the fruits of the earth,”and “the mother of the ears of corn”; and in a hymn composed in her honour she speaks ofherself as “queen of the wheat-field,” and is described as “charged with the care of the fruitfulfurrow’s wheat-rich path.” Accordingly, Greek or Roman artists often represented her withears of corn on her head or in her hand.Such, we may suppose, was Isis in the olden time, a rustic Corn-Mother adored with uncouthrites by Egyptian swains. But the homely features of the clownish goddess could hardly betraced in the refined, the saintly form which, spiritualised by ages of religious evolution, shepresented to her worshippers of after days as the true wife, the tender mother, the beneficentqueen of nature, encircled with the nimbus of moral purity, of immemorial and mysterioussanctity. Thus chastened and transfigured she won many hearts far beyond the boundaries ofher native land. In that welter of religions which accompanied the decline of national life inantiquity her worship was one of the most popular at Rome and throughout the empire. Someof the Roman emperors themselves were openly addicted to it. And however the religion ofIsis may, like any other, have been often worn as a cloak by men and women of loose life,her rites appear on the whole to have been honourably distinguished by a dignity and compo-sure, a solemnity and decorum, well fitted to soothe the troubled mind, to ease the burdenedheart. They appealed therefore to gentle spirits, and above all to women, whom the bloodyand licentious rites of other Oriental goddesses only shocked and repelled. We need not won-der, then, that in a period of decadence, when traditional faiths were shaken, when systemsclashed, when men’s minds were disquieted, when the fabric of empire itself, once deemedeternal, began to show ominous rents and fissures, the serene figure of Isis with her spiritualcalm, her gracious promise of immortality, should have appeared to many like a star in astormy sky, and should have roused in their breasts a rapture of devotion not unlike thatwhich was paid in the Middle Ages to the Virgin Mary. Indeed her stately ritual, with its shavenand tonsured priests, its matins and vespers, its tinkling music, its baptism and aspersions ofholy water, its solemn processions, its jewelled images of the Mother of God, presented manypoints of similarity to the pomps and ceremonies of Catholicism. The resemblance need notbe purely accidental. Ancient Egypt may have contributed its share to the gorgeous symbol-ism of the Catholic Church as well as to the pale abstractions of her theology. Certainly in artthe figure of Isis suckling the infant Horus is so like that of the Madonna and child that it hassometimes received the adoration of ignorant Christians. And to Isis in her later character ofpatroness of mariners the Virgin Mary perhaps owes her beautiful epithet of Stella Maris,“Star of the Sea,” under which she is adored by tempest-tossed sailors. The attributes of amarine deity may have been bestowed on Isis by the sea-faring Greeks of Alexandria. Theyare quite foreign to her original character and to the habits of the Egyptians, who had no loveof the sea. On this hypothesis Sirius, the bright star of Isis, which on July mornings rises fromthe glassy waves of the eastern Mediterranean, a harbinger of halcyon weather to mariners,was the true Stella Maris, “the Star of the Sea.”Chapter XLIIOsiris and the SunOSIRIS has been sometimes interpreted as the sun-god, and in modern times this view hasbeen held by so many distinguished writers that it deserves a brief examination. If we enquireon what evidence Osiris has been identified with the sun or the sun-god, it will be found onanalysis to be minute in quantity and dubious, where it is not absolutely worthless, in quality.Page 298"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"The diligent Jablonski, the first modern scholar to collect and sift the testimony of classicalwriters on Egyptian religion, says that it can be shown in many ways that Osiris is the sun,and that he could produce a cloud of witnesses to prove it, but that it is needless to do so,since no learned man is ignorant of the fact. Of the ancient writers whom he condescends toquote, the only two who expressly identify Osiris with the sun are Diodorus and Macrobius.But little weight can be attached to their evidence; for the statement of Diodorus is vague andrhetorical, and the reasons which Macrobius, one of the fathers of solar mythology, assignsfor the identification are exceedingly slight.The ground upon which some modern writers seem chiefly to rely for the identification ofOsiris with the sun is that the story of his death fits better with the solar phenomena than withany other in nature. It may readily be admitted that the daily appearance and disappearanceof the sun might very naturally be expressed by a myth of his death and resurrection; andwriters who regard Osiris as the sun are careful to indicate that it is the diurnal, and not theannual, course of the sun to which they understand the myth to apply. Thus Renouf, whoidentified Osiris with the sun, admitted that the Egyptian sun could not with any show of rea-son be described as dead in winter. But if his daily death was the theme of the legend, whywas it celebrated by an annual ceremony? This fact alone seems fatal to the interpretation ofthe myth as descriptive of sunset and sunrise. Again, though the sun may be said to die daily,in what sense can he be said to be torn in pieces?In the course of our enquiry it has, I trust, been made clear that there is another natural phe-nomenon to which the conception of death and resurrection is as applicable as to sunset andsunrise, and which, as a matter of fact, has been so conceived and represented in folk-cus-tom. That phenomenon is the annual growth and decay of vegetation. A strong reason forinterpreting the death of Osiris as the decay of vegetation rather than as the sunset is to befound in the general, though not unanimous, voice of antiquity, which classed together theworship and myths of Osiris, Adonis, Attis, Dionysus, and Demeter, as religions of essentiallythe same type. The consensus of ancient opinion on this subject seems too great to be reject-ed as a mere fancy. So closely did the rites of Osiris resemble those of Adonis at Byblus thatsome of the people of Byblus themselves maintained that it was Osiris and not Adonis whosedeath was mourned by them. Such a view could certainly not have been held if the rituals ofthe two gods had not been so alike as to be almost indistinguishable. Herodotus found thesimilarity between the rites of Osiris and Dionysus so great, that he thought it impossible thelatter could have arisen independently; they must, he supposed, have been recently bor-rowed, with slight alterations, by the Greeks from the Egyptians. Again, Plutarch, a very keenstudent of comparative religion, insists upon the detailed resemblance of the rites of Osiris tothose of Dionysus. We cannot reject the evidence of such intelligent and trustworthy witness-es on plain matters of fact which fell under their own cognizance. Their explanations of theworships it is indeed possible to reject, for the meaning of religious cults is often open toquestion; but resemblances of ritual are matters of observation. Therefore, those who explainOsiris as the sun are driven to the alternative of either dismissing as mistaken the testimonyof antiquity to the similarity of the rites of Osiris, Adonis, Attis, Dionysus, and Demeter, or ofinterpreting all these rites as sun-worship. No modern scholar has fairly faced and acceptedeither side of this alternative. To accept the former would be to affirm that we know the rites ofthese deities better than the men who practised, or at least who witnessed them. To acceptthe latter would involve a wrenching, clipping, mangling, and distorting of myth and ritual fromwhich even Macrobius shrank. On the other hand, the view that the essence of all these riteswas the mimic death and revival of vegetation, explains them separately and collectively in aneasy and natural way, and harmonises with the general testimony borne by the ancients toPage 299"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"their substantial similarity.Chapter XLIIIDionysusIN the preceding chapters we saw that in antiquity the civilised nations of Western Asia andEgypt pictured to themselves the changes of the seasons, and particularly the annual growthand decay of vegetation, as episodes in the life of gods, whose mournful death and happyresurrection they celebrated with dramatic rites of alternate lamentation and rejoicing. But ifthe celebration was in form dramatic, it was in substance magical; that is to say, it was intend-ed, on the principles of sympathetic magic, to ensure the vernal regeneration of plants andthe multiplication of animals, which had seemed to be menaced by the inroads of winter. Inthe ancient world, however, such ideas and such rites were by no means confined to theOriental peoples of Babylon and Syria, of Phrygia and Egypt; they were not a product peculiarto the religious mysticism of the dreamy East, but were shared by the races of livelier fancyand more mercurial temperament who inhabited the shores and islands of the Aegean. Weneed not, with some enquirers in ancient and modern times, suppose that these Westernpeoples borrowed from the older civilisation of the Orient the conception of the Dying andReviving God, together with the solemn ritual, in which that conception was dramatically setforth before the eyes of the worshippers. More probably the resemblance which may betraced in this respect between the religions of the East and West is no more than what wecommonly, though incorrectly, call a fortuitous coincidence, the effect of similar causes actingalike on the similar constitution of the human mind in different countries and under differentskies. The Greek had no need to journey into far countries to learn the vicissitudes of theseasons, to mark the fleeting beauty of the damask rose, the transient glory of the goldencorn, the passing splendour of the purple grapes. Year by year in his own beautiful land hebeheld, with natural regret, the bright pomp of summer fading into the gloom and stagnationof winter, and year by year he hailed with natural delight the outburst of fresh life in spring.Accustomed to personify the forces of nature, to tinge her cold abstractions with the warmhues of imagination, to clothe her naked realities with the gorgeous drapery of a mythic fancy,he fashioned for himself a train of gods and goddesses, of spirits and elves, out of the shiftingpanorama of the seasons, and followed the annual fluctuations of their fortunes with alternateemotions of cheerfulness and dejection, of gladness and sorrow, which found their naturalexpression in alternate rites of rejoicing and lamentation, of revelry and mourning. A consider-ation of some of the Greek divinities who thus died and rose again from the dead may furnishus with a series of companion pictures to set side by side with the sad figures of Adonis, Attis,and Osiris. We begin with Dionysus.The god Dionysus or Bacchus is best known to us as a personification of the vine and of theexhilaration produced by the juice of the grape. His ecstatic worship, characterised by wilddances, thrilling music, and tipsy excess, appears to have originated among the rude tribes ofThrace, who were notoriously addicted to drunkenness. Its mystic doctrines and extravagantrites were essentially foreign to the clear intelligence and sober temperament of the Greekrace. Yet appealing as it did to that love of mystery and that proneness to revert to savagerywhich seem to be innate in most men, the religion spread like wildfire through Greece untilthe god whom Homer hardly deigned to notice had become the most popular figure of thepantheon. The resemblance which his story and his ceremonies present to those of Osirishave led some enquirers both in ancient and modern times to hold that Dionysus was merelya disguised Osiris, imported directly from Egypt into Greece. But the great preponderance ofevidence points to his Thracian origin, and the similarity of the two worships is sufficientlyPage 300"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"explained by the similarity of the ideas and customs on which they were founded.While the vine with its clusters was the most characteristic manifestation of Dionysus, he wasalso a god of trees in general. Thus we are told that almost all the Greeks sacrificed to“Dionysus of the tree.” In Boeotia one of his titles was “Dionysus in the tree.” His image wasoften merely an upright post, without arms, but draped in a mantle, with a bearded mask torepresent the head, and with leafy boughs projecting from the head or body to show thenature of the deity. On a vase his rude effigy is depicted appearing out of a low tree or bush.At Magnesia on the Maeander an image of Dionysus is said to have been found in a plane-tree, which had been broken by the wind. He was the patron of cultivated trees: prayers wereoffered to him that he would make the trees grow; and he was especially honoured by hus-bandmen, chiefly fruit-growers, who set up an image of him, in the shape of a natural tree-stump, in their orchards. He was said to have discovered all tree-fruits, amongst which applesand figs are particularly mentioned; and he was referred to as “well-fruited,” “he of the greenfruit,” and “making the fruit to grow.” One of his titles was “teeming” or “bursting” (as of sap orblossoms); and there was a Flowery Dionysus in Attica and at Patrae in Achaia. TheAthenians sacrificed to him for the prosperity of the fruits of the land. Amongst the trees par-ticularly sacred to him, in addition to the vine, was the pine-tree. The Delphic oracle com-manded the Corinthians to worship a particular pine-tree “equally with the god,” so they madetwo images of Dionysus out of it, with red faces and gilt bodies. In art a wand, tipped with apine-cone, is commonly carried by the god or his worshippers. Again, the ivy and the fig-treewere especially associated with him. In the Attic township of Acharnae there was a DionysusIvy; at Lacedaemon there was a Fig Dionysus; and in Naxos, where figs were called meilicha,there was a Dionysus Meilichios, the face of whose image was made of fig-wood.Further, there are indications, few but significant, that Dionysus was conceived as a deity ofagriculture and the corn. He is spoken of as himself doing the work of a husbandman: he isreported to have been the first to yoke oxen to the plough, which before had been dragged byhand alone; and some people found in this tradition the clue to the bovine shape in which, aswe shall see, the god was often supposed to present himself to his worshippers. Thus guidingthe ploughshare and scattering the seed as he went, Dionysus is said to have eased thelabour of the husbandman. Further, we are told that in the land of the Bisaltae, a Thraciantribe, there was a great and fair sanctuary of Dionysus, where at his festival a bright lightshone forth at night as a token of an abundant harvest vouchsafed by the diety; but if thecrops were to fail that year, the mystic light was not seen, darkness brooded over the sanctu-ary as at other times. Moreover, among the emblems of Dionysus was the winnowing-fan,that is the large open shovel-shaped basket, which down to modern times has been used byfarmers to separate the grain from the chaff by tossing the corn in the air. This simple agricul-tural instrument figured in the mystic rites of Dionysus; indeed the god is traditionally said tohave been placed at birth in a winnowing-fan as in a cradle: in art he is represented as aninfant so cradled; and from these traditions and representations he derived the epithet ofLiknites, that is, “He of the Winnowing-fan.”Like other gods of vegetation Dionysus was believed to have died a violent death, but to havebeen brought to life again; and his sufferings, death, and resurrection were enacted in hissacred rites. His tragic story is thus told by the poet Nonnus. Zeus in the form of a serpentvisited Persephone, and she bore him Zagreus, that is, Dionysus, a horned infant. Scarcelywas he born, when the babe mounted the throne of his father Zeus and mimicked the greatgod by brandishing the lightning in his tiny hand. But he did not occupy the throne long; forthe treacherous Titans, their faces whitened with chalk, attacked him with knives while he wasPage 301"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"looking at himself in a mirror. For a time he evaded their assaults by turning himself into vari-ous shapes, assuming the likeness successively of Zeus and Cronus, of a young man, of alion, a horse, and a serpent. Finally, in the form of a bull, he was cut to pieces by the murder-ous knives of his enemies. His Cretan myth, as related by Firmicus Maternus, ran thus. Hewas said to have been the bastard son of Jupiter, a Cretan king. Going abroad, Jupiter trans-ferred the throne and sceptre to the youthful Dionysus, but, knowing that his wife Juno cher-ished a jealous dislike of the child, he entrusted Dionysus to the care of guards upon whosefidelity he believed he could rely. Juno, however, bribed the guards, and amusing the childwith rattles and a cunningly-wrought looking glass lured him into an ambush, where her satel-lites, the Titans, rushed upon him, cut him limb from limb, boiled his body with various herbs,and ate it. But his sister Minerva, who had shared in the deed, kept his heart and gave it toJupiter on his return, revealing to him the whole history of the crime. In his rage, Jupiter putthe Titans to death by torture, and, to soothe his grief for the loss of his son, made an imagein which he enclosed the child’s heart, and then built a temple in his honour. In this version aEuhemeristic turn has been given to the myth by representing Jupiter and Juno (Zeus andHera) as a king and queen of Crete. The guards referred to are the mythical Curetes whodanced a war-dance round the infant Dionysus, as they are said to have done round theinfant Zeus. Very noteworthy is the legend, recorded both by Nonnus and Firmicus, that in hisinfancy Dionysus occupied for a short time the throne of his father Zeus. So Proclus tells usthat “Dionysus was the last king of the gods appointed by Zeus. For his father set him on thekingly throne, and placed in his hand the sceptre, and made him king of all the gods of theworld.” Such traditions point to a custom of temporarily investing the king’s son with the royaldignity as a preliminary to sacrificing him instead of his father. Pomegranates were supposedto have sprung from the blood of Dionysus, as anemones from the blood of Adonis and vio-lets from the blood of Attis: hence women refrained from eating seeds of pomegranates at thefestival of the Thesmophoria. According to some, the severed limbs of Dionysus were piecedtogether, at the command of Zeus, by Apollo, who buried them on Parnassus. The grave ofDionysus was shown in the Delphic temple beside a golden statue of Apollo. However,according to another account, the grave of Dionysus was at Thebes, where he is said to havebeen torn in pieces. Thus far the resurrection of the slain god is not mentioned, but in otherversions of the myth it is variously related. According to one version, which representedDionysus as a son of Zeus and Demeter, his mother pieced together his mangled limbs andmade him young again. In others it is simply said that shortly after his burial he rose from thedead and ascended up to heaven; or that Zeus raised him up as he lay mortally wounded; orthat Zeus swallowed the heart of Dionysus and then begat him afresh by Semele, who in thecommon legend figures as mother of Dionysus. Or, again, the heart was pounded up andgiven in a potion to Semele, who thereby conceived him.Turning from the myth to the ritual, we find that the Cretans celebrated a biennial festival atwhich the passion of Dionysus was represented in every detail. All that he had done or suf-fered in his last moments was enacted before the eyes of his worshippers, who tore a live bullto pieces with their teeth and roamed the woods with frantic shouts. In front of them was car-ried a casket supposed to contain the sacred heart of Dionysus, and to the wild music offlutes and cymbals they mimicked the rattles by which the infant god had been lured to hisdoom. Where the resurrection formed part of the myth, it also was acted at the rites, and iteven appears that a general doctrine of resurrection, or at least of immortality, was inculcatedon the worshippers; for Plutarch, writing to console his wife on the death of their infant daugh-ter, comforts her with the thought of the immortality of the soul as taught by tradition andrevealed in the mysteries of Dionysus. A different form of the myth of the death and resurrec-tion of Dionysus is that he descended into Hades to bring up his mother Semele from thePage 302"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"dead. The local Argive tradition was that he went down through the Alcyonian lake; and hisreturn from the lower world, in other words his resurrection, was annually celebrated on thespot by the Argives, who summoned him from the water by trumpet blasts, while they threw alamb into the lake as an offering to the warder of the dead. Whether this was a spring festivaldoes not appear, but the Lydians certainly celebrated the advent of Dionysus in spring; thegod was supposed to bring the season with him. Deities of vegetation, who are believed topass a certain portion of each year underground, naturally come to be regarded as gods ofthe lower world or of the dead. Both Dionysus and Osiris were so conceived.Afeature in the mythical character of Dionysus, which at first sight appears inconsistent withhis nature as a deity of vegetation, is that he was often conceived and represented in animalshape, especially in the form, or at least with the horns, of a bull. Thus he is spoken of as“cow-born,” “bull,” “bull-shaped,” “bull-faced,” “bull-browed,” “bull-horned,” “horn-bearing,”“two-horned,” “horned.” He was believed to appear, at least occasionally, as a bull. Hisimages were often, as at Cyzicus, made in bull shape, or with bull horns; and he was paintedwith horns. Types of the horned Dionysus are found amongst the surviving monuments ofantiquity. On one statuette he appears clad in a bull’s hide, the head, horns, and hoofs hang-ing down behind. Again, he is represented as a child with clusters of grapes round his brow,and a calf’s head, with sprouting horns, attached to the back of his head. On a red-figuredvase the god is portrayed as a calf-headed child seated on a woman’s lap. The people ofCynaetha held a festival of Dionysus in winter, when men, who had greased their bodies withoil for the occasion, used to pick out a bull from the herd and carry it to the sanctuary of thegod. Dionysus was supposed to inspire their choice of the particular bull, which probably rep-resented the deity himself; for at his festivals he was believed to appear in bull form. Thewomen of Elis hailed him as a bull, and prayed him to come with his bull’s foot. They sang,“Come hither, Dionysus, to thy holy temple by the sea; come with the Graces to thy temple,rushing with thy bull’s foot, O goodly bull, O goodly bull!” The Bacchanals of Thrace worehorns in imitation of their god. According to the myth, it was in the shape of a bull that he wastorn to pieces by the Titans; and the Cretans, when they acted the sufferings and death ofDionysus, tore a live bull to pieces with their teeth. Indeed, the rending and devouring of livebulls and calves appear to have been a regular feature of the Dionysiac rites. When we con-sider the practice of portraying the god as a bull or with some of the features of the animal,the belief that he appeared in bull form to his worshippers at the sacred rites, and the legendthat in bull form he had been torn in pieces, we cannot doubt that in rending and devouring alive bull at his festival the worshippers of Dionysus believed themselves to be killing the god,eating his flesh, and drinking his blood.Another animal whose form Dionysus assumed was the goat. One of his names was “Kid.” AtAthens and at Hermion he was worshipped under the title of “the one of the Black Goatskin,”and a legend ran that on a certain occasion he had appeared clad in the skin from which hetook the title. In the wine-growing district of Phlius, where in autumn the plain is still thicklymantled with the red and golden foliage of the fading vines, there stood of old a bronze imageof a goat, which the husbandmen plastered with gold-leaf as a means of protecting their vinesagainst blight. The image probably represented the vine-god himself. To save him from thewrath of Hera, his father Zeus changed the youthful Dionysus into a kid; and when the godsfled to Egypt to escape the fury of Typhon, Dionysus was turned into a goat. Hence when hisworshippers rent in pieces a live goat and devoured it raw, they must have believed that theywere eating the body and blood of the god. The custom of tearing in pieces the bodies of ani-mals and of men and then devouring them raw has been practised as a religious rite by sav-ages in modern times. We need not therefore dismiss as a fable the testimony of antiquity toPage 303"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"the observance of similar rites among the frenzied worshippers of Bacchus.The custom of killing a god in animal form, which we shall examine more in detail further on,belongs to a very early stage of human culture, and is apt in later times to be misunderstood.The advance of thought tends to strip the old animal and plant gods of their bestial and veg-etable husk, and to leave their human attributes (which are always the kernel of the concep-tion) as the final and sole residuum. In other words, animal and plant gods tend to becomepurely anthropomorphic. When they have become wholly or nearly so, the animals and plantswhich were at first the deities themselves, still retain a vague and ill-understood connexionwith the anthropomorphic gods who have developed out of them. The origin of the relation-ship between the deity and the animal or plant having been forgotten, various stories areinvented to explain it. These explanations may follow one of two lines according as they arebased on the habitual or on the exceptional treatment of the sacred animal or plant. Thesacred animal was habitually spared, and only exceptionally slain; and accordingly the mythmight be devised to explain either why it was spared or why it was killed. Devised for the for-mer purpose, the myth would tell of some service rendered to the deity by the animal;devised for the latter purpose, the myth would tell of some injury inflicted by the animal on thegod. The reason given for sacrificing goats to Dionysus exemplifies a myth of the latter sort.They were sacrificed to him, it was said, because they injured the vine. Now the goat, as wehave seen, was originally an embodiment of the god himself. But when the god had divestedhimself of his animal character and had become essentially anthropomorphic, the killing of thegoat in his worship came to be regarded no longer as a slaying of the deity himself, but as asacrifice offered to him; and since some reason had to be assigned why the goat in particularshould be sacrificed, it was alleged that this was a punishment inflicted on the goat for injur-ing the vine, the object of the god’s especial care. Thus we have the strange spectacle of agod sacrificed to himself on the ground that he is his own enemy. And as the deity is sup-posed to partake of the victim offered to him, it follows that, when the victim is the god’s oldself, the god eats of his own flesh. Hence the goat-god Dionysus is represented as eating rawgoat’s blood; and the bull-god Dionysus is called “eater of bulls.” On the analogy of theseinstances we may conjecture that wherever a deity is described as the eater of a particularanimal, the animal in question was originally nothing but the deity himself. Later on we shallfind that some savages propitiate dead bears and whales by offering them portions of theirown bodies.All this, however, does not explain why a deity of vegetation should appear in animal form.But the consideration of that point had better be deferred till we have discussed the characterand attributes of Demeter. Meantime it remains to mention that in some places, instead of ananimal, a human being was torn in pieces at the rites of Dionysus. This was the practice inChios and Tenedos; and at Potniae in Boeotia the tradition ran that it had been formerly thecustom to sacrifice to the goat-smiting Dionysus a child, for whom a goat was afterwards sub-stituted. At Orchomenus, as we have seen, the human victim was taken from the women ofan old royal family. As the slain bull or goat represented the slain god, so, we may suppose,the human victim also represented him.The legends of the deaths of Pentheus and Lycurgus, two kings who are said to have beentorn to pieces, the one by Bacchanals, the other by horses, for their opposition to the rites ofDionysus, may be, as I have already suggested, distorted reminiscences of a custom of sacri-ficing divine kings in the character of Dionysus and of dispersing the fragments of their bro-ken bodies over the fields for the purpose of fertilising them. It is probably no mere coinci-dence that Dionysus himself is said to have been torn in pieces at Thebes, the very placePage 304"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"where according to legend the same fate befell king Pentheus at the hands of the frenziedvotaries of the vine-god.However, a tradition of human sacrifice may sometimes have been a mere misinterpretationof a sacrificial ritual in which an animal victim was treated as a human being. For example, atTenedos the new-born calf sacrificed to Dionysus was shod in buskins, and the mother cowwas tended like a woman in child-bed. At Rome a shegoat was sacrificed to Vedijovis as if itwere a human victim. Yet on the other hand it is equally possible, and perhaps more proba-ble, that these curious rites were themselves mitigations of an older and ruder custom of sac-rificing human beings, and that the later pretence of treating the sacrificial victims as if theywere human beings was merely part of a pious and merciful fraud, which palmed off on thedeity less precious victims than living men and women. This interpretation is supported bymany undoubted cases in which animals have been substituted for human victims. Chapter XLIVDemeter and PersephoneDIONYSUS was not the only Greek deity whose tragic story and ritual appear to reflect thedecay and revival of vegetation. In another form and with a different application the old talereappears in the myth of Demeter and Persephone. Substantially their myth is identical withthe Syrian one of Aphrodite (Astarte) and Adonis, the Phrygian one of Cybele and Attis, andthe Egyptian one of Isis and Osiris. In the Greek fable, as in its Asiatic and Egyptian counter-parts, a goddess mourns the loss of a loved one, who personifies the vegetation, more espe-cially the corn, which dies in winter to revive in spring; only whereas the Oriental imaginationfigured the loved and lost one as a dead lover or a dead husband lamented by his leman orhis wife, Greek fancy embodied the same idea in the tenderer and purer form of a deaddaughter bewailed by her sorrowing mother.The oldest literary document which narrates the myth of Demeter and Persephone is thebeautiful Homeric Hymn to Demeter, which critics assign to the seventh century before ourera. The object of the poem is to explain the origin of the Eleusinian mysteries, and the com-plete silence of the poet as to Athens and the Athenians, who in after ages took conspicuouspart in the festival, renders it probable that the hymn was composed in the far off time whenEleusis was still a petty independent state, and before the stately procession of the Mysterieshad begun to defile, in bright September days, over the low chain of barren rocky hills whichdivides the flat Eleusinian cornland from the more spacious olive-clad expanse of theAthenian plain. Be that as it may, the hymn reveals to us the conception which the writerentertained of the character and functions of the two goddesses; their natural shapes standout sharply enough under the thin veil of poetical imagery. The youthful Persephone, so runsthe tale, was gathering roses and lilies, crocuses and violets, hyacinths and narcissuses in alush meadow, when the earth gaped and Pluto, lord of the Dead, issuing from the abyss car-ried her off on his golden car to be his bride and queen in the gloomy subterranean world.Her sorrowing mother Demeter, with her yellow tresses veiled in a dark mourning mantle,sought her over land and sea, and learning from the Sun her daughter’s fate she withdrew inhigh dudgeon from the gods and took up her abode at Eleusis, where she presented herselfto the king’s daughters in the guise of an old woman, sitting sadly under the shadow of anolive tree beside the Maiden’s Well, to which the damsels had come to draw water in bronzepitchers for their father’s house. In her wrath at her bereavement the goddess suffered notthe seed to grow in the earth but kept it hidden under ground, and she vowed that neverwould she set foot on Olympus and never would she let the corn sprout till her lost daughterPage 305"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"should be restored to her. Vainly the oxen dragged the ploughs to and fro in the fields; vainlythe sower dropped the barley seed in the brown furrows; nothing came up from the parchedand crumbling soil. Even the Rarian plain near Eleusis, which was wont to wave with yellowharvests, lay bare and fallow. Mankind would have perished of hunger and the gods wouldhave been robbed of the sacrifices which were their due, if Zeus in alarm had not command-ed Pluto to disgorge his prey, to restore his bride Persephone to her mother Demeter. Thegrim lord of the Dead smiled and obeyed, but before he sent back his queen to the upper airon a golden car, he gave her the seed of a pomegranate to eat, which ensured that shewould return to him. But Zeus stipulated that henceforth Persephone should spend two thirdsof every year with her mother and the gods in the upper world and one third of the year withher husband in the nether world, from which she was to return year by year when the earthwas gay with spring flowers. Gladly the daughter then returned to the sunshine, gladly hermother received her and fell upon her neck; and in her joy at recovering the lost one Demetermade the corn to sprout from the clods of the ploughed fields and all the broad earth to beheavy with leaves and blossoms. And straightway she went and showed this happy sight tothe princes of Eleusis, to Triptolemus, Eumolpus, Diocles, and to the king Celeus himself, andmoreover she revealed to them her sacred rites and mysteries. Blessed, says the poet, is themortal man who has seen these things, but he who has had no share of them in life will neverbe happy in death when he has descended into the darkness of the grave. So the two god-desses departed to dwell in bliss with the gods on Olympus; and the bard ends the hymn witha pious prayer to Demeter and Persephone that they would be pleased to grant him a liveli-hood in return for his song.It has been generally recognised, and indeed it seems scarcely open to doubt, that the maintheme which the poet set before himself in composing this hymn was to describe the tradi-tional foundation of the Eleusinian mysteries by the goddess Demeter. The whole poem leadsup to the transformation scene in which the bare leafless expanse of the Eleusinian plain issuddenly turned, at the will of the goddess, into a vast sheet of ruddy corn; the beneficentdeity takes the princes of Eleusis, shows them what she has done, teaches them her mysticrites, and vanishes with her daughter to heaven. The revelation of the mysteries is the tri-umphal close of the piece. This conclusion is confirmed by a more minute examination of thepoem, which proves that the poet has given, not merely a general account of the foundationof the mysteries, but also in more or less veiled language mythical explanations of the originof particular rites which we have good reason to believe formed essential features of the festi-val. Amongst the rites as to which the poet thus drops significant hints are the preliminary fastof the candidates for initiation, the torchlight procession, the all-night vigil, the sitting of thecandidates, veiled and in silence, on stools covered with sheepskins, the use of scurrilouslanguage, the breaking of ribald jests, and the solemn communion with the divinity by partici-pation in a draught of barley-water from a holy chalice.But there is yet another and a deeper secret of the mysteries which the author of the poemappears to have divulged under cover of his narrative. He tells us how, as soon as she hadtransformed the barren brown expanse of the Eleusinian plain into a field of golden grain, shegladdened the eyes of Triptolemus and the other Eleusinian princes by showing them thegrowing or standing corn. When we compare this part of the story with the statement of aChristian writer of the second century, Hippolytus, that the very heart of the mysteries consist-ed in showing to the initiated a reaped ear of corn, we can hardly doubt that the poet of thehymn was well acquainted with this solemn rite, and that he deliberately intended to explainits origin in precisely the same way as he explained other rites of the mysteries, namely byrepresenting Demeter as having set the example of performing the ceremony in her own per-Page 306"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"son. Thus myth and ritual mutually explain and confirm each other. The poet of the seventhcentury before our era gives us the myth—he could not without sacrilege have revealed theritual: the Christian father reveals the ritual, and his revelation accords perfectly with theveiled hint of the old poet. On the whole, then, we may, with many modern scholars, confi-dently accept the statement of the learned Christian father Clement of Alexandria, that themyth of Demeter and Persephone was acted as a sacred drama in the mysteries of Eleusis.But if the myth was acted as a part, perhaps as the principal part, of the most famous andsolemn religious rites of ancient Greece, we have still to enquire, What was, after all, strippedof later accretions, the original kernel of the myth which appears to later ages surrounded andtransfigured by an aureole of awe and mystery, lit up by some of the most brilliant rays ofGrecian literature and art? If we follow the indications given by our oldest literary authority onthe subject, the author of the Homeric hymn to Demeter, the riddle is not hard to read; the fig-ures of the two goddesses, the mother and the daughter, resolve themselves into personifica-tions of the corn. At least this appears to be fairly certain for the daughter Persephone. Thegoddess who spends three or, according to another version of the myth, six months of everyyear with the dead under ground and the remainder of the year with the living above ground;in whose absence the barley seed is hidden in the earth and the fields lie bare and fallow; onwhose return in spring to the upper world the corn shoots up from the clods and the earth isheavy with leaves and blossoms—this goddess can surely be nothing else than a mythicalembodiment of the vegetation, and particularly of the corn, which is buried under the soil forsome months of every winter and comes to life again, as from the grave, in the sproutingcornstalks and the opening flowers and foliage of every spring. No other reasonable andprobable explanation of Persephone seems possible. And if the daughter goddess was a per-sonification of the young corn of the present year, may not the mother goddess be a personi-fication of the old corn of last year, which has given birth to the new crops? The only alterna-tive to this view of Demeter would seem to be to suppose that she is a personification of theearth, from whose broad bosom the corn and all other plants spring up, and of which accord-ingly they may appropriately enough be regarded as the daughters. This view of the originalnature of Demeter has indeed been taken by some writers, both ancient and modern, and it isone which can be reasonably maintained. But it appears to have been rejected by the authorof the Homeric hymn to Demeter, for he not only distinguishes Demeter from the personifiedEarth but places the two in the sharpest opposition to each other. He tells us that it was Earthwho, in accordance with the will of Zeus and to please Pluto, lured Persephone to her doomby causing the narcissuses to grow which tempted the young goddess to stray far beyond thereach of help in the lush meadow. Thus Demeter of the hymn, far from being identical withthe Earth-goddess, must have regarded that divinity as her worst enemy, since it was to herinsidious wiles that she owed the loss of her daughter. But if the Demeter of the hymn cannothave been a personification of the earth, the only alternative apparently is to conclude thatshe was a personification of the corn.The conclusion is confirmed by the monuments; for in ancient art Demeter and Persephoneare alike characterised as goddesses of the corn by the crowns of corn which they wear ontheir heads and by the stalks of corn which they hold in their hands. Again, it was Demeterwho first revealed to the Athenians the secret of the corn and diffused the beneficent discov-ery far and wide through the agency of Triptolemus, whom she sent forth as an itinerant mis-sionary to communicate the boon to all mankind. On monuments of art, especially in vase-paintings, he is constantly represented along with Demeter in this capacity, holding corn-stalks in his hand and sitting in his car, which is sometimes winged and sometimes drawn bydragons, and from which he is said to have sowed the seed down on the whole world as hePage 307"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"sped through the air. In gratitude for the priceless boon many Greek cities long continued tosend the first-fruits of their barley and wheat harvests as thank-offerings to the TwoGoddesses, Demeter and Persephone, at Eleusis, where subterranean granaries were built tostore the overflowing contributions. Theocritus tells how in the island of Cos, in the sweet-scented summer time, the farmer brought the first-fruits of the harvest to Demeter who hadfilled his threshingfloor with barley, and whose rustic image held sheaves and poppies in herhands. Many of the epithets bestowed by the ancients on Demeter mark her intimate associa-tion with the corn in the clearest manner.How deeply implanted in the mind of the ancient Greeks was this faith in Demeter as god-dess of the corn may be judged by the circumstance that the faith actually persisted amongtheir Christian descendants at her old sanctuary of Eleusis down to the beginning of the nine-teenth century. For when the English traveller Dodwell revisited Eleusis, the inhabitantslamented to him the loss of a colossal image of Demeter, which was carried off by Clarke in1802 and presented to the University of Cambridge, where it still remains. “In my first journeyto Greece,” says Dodwell, “this protecting deity was in its full glory, situated in the centre of athreshing-floor, amongst the ruins of her temple. The villagers were impressed with a persua-sion that their rich harvests were the effect of her bounty, and since her removal, their abun-dance, as they assured me, has disappeared.” Thus we see the Corn Goddess Demeterstanding on the threshing-floor of Eleusis and dispensing corn to her worshippers in the nine-teenth century of the Christian era, precisely as her image stood and dispensed corn to herworshippers on the threshing-floor of Cos in the days of Theocritus. And just as the people ofEleusis in the nineteenth century attributed the diminution of their harvests to the loss of theimage of Demeter, so in antiquity the Sicilians, a corn-growing people devoted to the worshipof the two Corn Goddesses, lamented that the crops of many towns had perished becausethe unscrupulous Roman governor Verres had impiously carried off the image of Demeterfrom her famous temple at Henna. Could we ask for a clearer proof that Demeter was indeedthe goddess of the corn than this belief, held by the Greeks down to modern times, that thecorn-crops depended on her presence and bounty and perished when her image wasremoved?On the whole, then, if, ignoring theories, we adhere to the evidence of the ancients them-selves in regard to the rites of Eleusis, we shall probably incline to agree with the mostlearned of ancient antiquaries, the Roman Varro, who, to quote Augustine’s report of his opin-ion, “interpreted the whole of the Eleusinian mysteries as relating to the corn which Ceres(Demeter) had discovered, and to Proserpine (Persephone), whom Pluto had carried off fromher. And Proserpine herself he said, signifies the fecundity of the seeds, the failure of whichat a certain time had caused the earth to mourn for barrenness, and therefore had given riseto the opinion that the daughter of Ceres, that is, fecundity itself, had been ravished by Plutoand detained in the nether world; and when the dearth had been publicly mourned and fecun-dity had returned once more, there was gladness at the return of Proserpine and solemn riteswere instituted accordingly. After that he says,” continues Augustine, reporting Varro, “thatmany things were taught in her mysteries which had no reference but to the discovery of thecorn.”Thus far I have for the most part assumed an identity of nature between Demeter andPersephone, the divine mother and daughter personifying the corn in its double aspect of theseed-corn of last year and the ripe ears of this, and this view of the substantial unity of moth-er and daughter is borne out by their portraits in Greek art, which are often so alike as to beindistinguishable. Such a close resemblance between the artistic types of Demeter andPage 308"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Persephone militates decidedly against the view that the two goddesses are mythical embodi-ments of two things so different and so easily distinguishable from each other as the earthand the vegetation which springs from it. Had Greek artists accepted that view of Demeterand Persephone, they could surely have devised types of them which would have brought outthe deep distinction between the goddesses. And if Demeter did not personify the earth, canthere be any reasonable doubt that, like her daughter, she personified the corn which was socommonly called by her name from the time of Homer downwards? The essential identity ofmother and daughter is suggested, not only by the close resemblance of their artistic types,but also by the official title of “the Two Goddesses” which was regularly applied to them in thegreat sanctuary at Eleusis without any specification of their individual attributes and titles, asif their separate individualities had almost merged in a single divine substance.Surveying the evidence as a whole, we are fairly entitled to conclude that in the mind of theordinary Greek the two goddesses were essentially personifications of the corn, and that inthis germ the whole efflorescence of their religion finds implicitly its explanation. But to main-tain this is not to deny that in the long course of religious evolution high moral and spiritualconceptions were grafted on this simple original stock and blossomed out into fairer flowersthan the bloom of the barley and the wheat. Above all, the thought of the seed buried in theearth in order to spring up to new and higher life readily suggested a comparison with humandestiny, and strengthened the hope that for man too the grave may be but the beginning of abetter and happier existence in some brighter world unknown. This simple and natural reflec-tion seems perfectly sufficient to explain the association of the Corn Goddess at Eleusis withthe mystery of death and the hope of a blissful immortality. For that the ancients regarded ini-tiation in the Eleusinian mysteries as a key to unlock the gates of Paradise appears to beproved by the allusions which well-informed writers among them drop to the happiness instore for the initiated hereafter. No doubt it is easy for us to discern the flimsiness of the logi-cal foundation on which such high hopes were built. But drowning men clutch at straws, andwe need not wonder that the Greeks, like ourselves, with death before them and a great loveof life in their hearts, should not have stopped to weigh with too nice a hand the argumentsthat told for and against the prospect of human immortality. The reasoning that satisfied SaintPaul and has brought comfort to untold thousands of sorrowing Christians, standing by thedeathbed or the open grave of their loved ones, was good enough to pass muster withancient pagans, when they too bowed their heads under the burden of grief, and, with thetaper of life burning low in the socket, looked forward into the darkness of the unknown.Therefore we do no indignity to the myth of Demeter and Persephone—one of the few mythsin which the sunshine and clarity of the Greek genius are crossed by the shadow and mysteryof death—when we trace its origin to some of the most familiar, yet eternally affecting aspectsof nature, to the melancholy gloom and decay of autumn and to the freshness, the brightness,and the verdure of spring.Chapter XLVThe Corn-Mother and the Corn-Maiden in Northern Europe.IT has been argued by W. Mannhardt that the first part of Demeter’s name is derived from analleged Cretan word deai, “barley,” and that accordingly Demeter means neither more norless than “Barley-mother” or “Corn-mother”; for the root of the word seems to have beenapplied to different kinds of grain by different branches of the Aryans. As Crete appears tohave been one of the most ancient seats of the worship of Demeter, it would not be surprisingif her name were of Cretan origin. But the etymology is open to serious objections, and it issafer therefore to lay no stress on it. Be that as it may, we have found independent reasonsPage 309"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"for identifying Demeter as the Corn-mother, and of the two species of corn associated withher in Greek religion, namely barley and wheat, the barley has perhaps the better claim to beher original element; for not only would it seem to have been the staple food of the Greeks inthe Homeric age, but there are grounds for believing that it is one of the oldest, if not the veryoldest, cereal cultivated by the Aryan race. Certainly the use of barley in the religious ritual ofthe ancient Hindoos as well as of the ancient Greeks furnishes a strong argument in favour ofthe great antiquity of its cultivation, which is known to have been practised by the lake-dwellers of the Stone Age in Europe.Analogies to the Corn-mother or Barley-mother of ancient Greece have been collected ingreat abundance by W. Mannhardt from the folk-lore of modern Europe. The following mayserve as specimens.In Germany the corn is very commonly personified under the name of the Corn-mother. Thusin spring, when the corn waves in the wind, the peasants say, “There comes the Corn-moth-er,” or “The Corn-mother is running over the field,” or “The Corn-mother is going through thecorn.” When children wish to go into the fields to pull the blue corn-flowers or the red poppies,they are told not to do so, because the Corn-mother is sitting in the corn and will catch them.Or again she is called, according to the crop, the Rye-mother or the Pea-mother, and childrenare warned against straying in the rye or among the peas by threats of the Rye-mother or thePea-mother. Again the Corn-mother is believed to make the crop grow. Thus in the neighbour-hood of Magdeburg it is sometimes said, “It will be a good year for flax; the Flax-mother hasbeen seen.” In a village of Styria it is said that the Corn-mother, in the shape of a female pup-pet made out of the last sheaf of corn and dressed in white, may be seen at mid-night in thecorn-fields, which she fertilises by passing through them; but if she is angry with a farmer, shewithers up all his corn.Further, the Corn-mother plays an important part in harvest customs. She is believed to bepresent in the handful of corn which is left standing last on the field; and with the cutting ofthis last handful she is caught, or driven away, or killed. In the first of these cases, the lastsheaf is carried joyfully home and honoured as a divine being. It is placed in the barn, and atthreshing the corn-spirit appears again. In the Hanoverian district of Hadeln the reapers standround the last sheaf and beat it with sticks in order to drive the Corn-mother out of it. Theycall to each other, “There she is! hit her! Take care she doesn’t catch you!” The beating goeson till the grain is completely threshed out; then the Corn-mother is believed to be drivenaway. In the neighbourhood of Danzig the person who cuts the last ears of corn makes theminto a doll, which is called the Corn-mother or the Old Woman and is brought home on thelast waggon. In some parts of Holstein the last sheaf is dressed in woman’s clothes andcalled the Corn-mother. It is carried home on the last waggon, and then thoroughly drenchedwith water. The drenching with water is doubtless a rain-charm. In the district of Bruck inStyria the last sheaf, called the Corn-mother, is made up into the shape of a woman by theoldest married woman in the village, of an age from fifty to fifty-five years. The finest ears areplucked out of it and made into a wreath, which, twined with flowers, is carried on her headby the prettiest girl of the village to the farmer or squire, while the Corn-mother is laid down inthe barn to keep off the mice. In other villages of the same district the Corn-mother, at theclose of harvest, is carried by two lads at the top of a pole. They march behind the girl whowears the wreath to the squire’s house, and while he receives the wreath and hangs it up inthe hall, the Corn-mother is placed on the top of a pile of wood, where she is the centre of theharvest supper and dance. Afterwards she is hung up in the barn and remains there till thethreshing is over. The man who gives the last stroke at threshing is called the son of thePage 310"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Corn-mother; he is tied up in the Corn-mother, beaten, and carried through the village. Thewreath is dedicated in church on the following Sunday; and on Easter Eve the grain is rubbedout of it by a seven-year-old girl andscattered amongst the young corn. At Christmas the straw of the wreath is placed in themanger to make the cattle thrive. Here the fertilising power of the Corn-mother is plainlybrought out by scattering the seed taken from her body (for the wreath is made out of theCorn-mother) among the new corn; and her influence over animal life is indicated by placingthe straw in the manger. Amongst the Slavs also the last sheaf is known as the Rye-mother,the Wheat-mother, the Oats-mother, the Barley-mother, and so on, according to the crop. Inthe district of Tarnow, Galicia, the wreath made out of the last stalks is called the Wheat-mother, Rye-mother, or Pea-mother. It is placed on a girl’s head and kept till spring, whensome of the grain is mixed with the seed-corn. Here again the fertilising power of the Corn-mother is indicated. In France, also, in the neighbourhood of Auxerre, the last sheaf goes bythe name of the Mother of the Wheat, Mother of the Barley, Mother of the Rye, or Mother ofthe Oats. They leave it standing in the field till the last waggon is about to wend homewards.Then they make a puppet out of it, dress it with clothes belonging to the farmer, and adorn itwith a crown and a blue or white scarf. A branch of a tree is stuck in the breast of the puppet,which is now called the Ceres. At the dance in the evening the Ceres is set in the middle ofthe floor, and the reaper who reaped fastest dances round it with the prettiest girl for his part-ner. After the dance a pyre is made. All the girls, each wearing a wreath, strip the puppet, pullit to pieces, and place it on the pyre, along with the flowers with which it was adorned. Thenthe girl who was the first to finish reaping sets fire to the pile, and all pray that Ceres maygive a fruitful year. Here, as Mannhardt observes, the old custom has remained intact, thoughthe name Ceres is a bit of schoolmaster’s learning. In Upper Brittany the last sheaf is alwaysmade into human shape; but if the farmer is a married man, it is made double and consists ofa little corn-puppet placed inside of a large one. This is called the Mother-sheaf. It is deliveredto the farmer’s wife, who unties it and gives drink-money in return.Sometimes the last sheaf is called, not the Corn-mother, but the Harvest-mother or the GreatMother. In the province of Osnabrück, Hanover, it is called the Harvest-mother; it is made upin female form, and then the reapers dance about with it. In some parts of Westphalia the lastsheaf at the rye-harvest is made especially heavy by fastening stones in it. They bring ithome on the last waggon and call it the Great Mother, though they do not fashion it into anyspecial shape. In the district of Erfurt a very heavy sheaf, not necessarily the last, is calledthe Great Mother, and is carried on the last waggon to the barn, where all hands lift it downamid a fire of jokes.Sometimes again the last sheaf is called the Grandmother, and is adorned with flowers, rib-bons, and a woman’s apron. In East Prussia, at the rye or wheat harvest, the reapers call outto the woman who binds the last sheaf, “You are getting the Old Grandmother.” In the neigh-bourhood of Magdeburg the men and women servants strive who shall get the last sheaf,called the Grandmother. Whoever gets it will be married in the next year, but his or herspouse will be old; if a girl gets it, she will marry a widower; if a man gets it, he will marry anold crone. In Silesia the Grandmother—a huge bundle made up of three or four sheaves bythe person who tied the last sheaf—was formerly fashioned into a rude likeness of the humanform. In the neighbourhood of Belfast the last sheaf sometimes goes by the name of theGranny. It is not cut in the usual way, but all the reapers throw their sickles at it and try tobring it down. It is plaited and kept till the (next?) autumn. Whoever gets it will marry in thecourse of the year.Page 311"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Often the last sheaf is called the Old Woman or the Old Man. In Germany it is frequentlyshaped and dressed as a woman, and the person who cuts it or binds it is said to “get theOld Woman.” At Altisheim, in Swabia, when all the corn of a farm has been cut except a sin-gle strip, all the reapers stand in a row before the strip; each cuts his share rapidly, and hewho gives the last cut “has the Old Woman.” When the sheaves are being set up in heaps,the person who gets hold of the Old Woman, which is the largest and thickest of all thesheaves, is jeered at by the rest, who call out to him, “He has the Old Woman and must keepher.” The woman who binds the last sheaf is sometimes herself called the Old Woman, and itis said that she will be married in the next year. In Neusaass, West Prussia, both the lastsheaf—which is dressed up in jacket, hat, and ribbons—and the woman who binds it arecalled the Old Woman. Together they are brought home on the last waggon and are drenchedwith water. In various parts of North Germany the last sheaf at harvest is made up into ahuman effigy and called “the Old Man”; and the woman who bound it is said “to have the OldMan.”In West Prussia, when the last rye is being raked together, the women and girls hurry with thework, for none of them likes to be the last and to get “the Old Man,” that is, a puppet madeout of the last sheaf, which must be carried before the other reapers by the person who wasthe last to finish. In Silesia the last sheaf is called the Old Woman or the Old Man and is thetheme of many jests; it is made unusually large and is sometimes weighted with a stone.Among the Wends the man or woman who binds the last sheaf at wheat harvest is said to“have the Old Man.” A puppet is made out of the wheaten straw and ears in the likeness of aman and decked with flowers. The person who bound the last sheaf must carry the Old Manhome, while the rest laugh and jeer at him. The puppet is hung up in the farmhouse andremains till a new Old Man is made at the next harvest.In some of these customs, as Mannhardt has remarked, the person who is called by thesame name as the last sheaf and sits beside it on the last waggon is obviously identified withit; he or she represents the corn-spirit which has been caught in the last sheaf; in otherwords, the corn-spirit is represented in duplicate, by a human being and by a sheaf. The iden-tification of the person with the sheaf is made still clearer by the custom of wrapping up in thelast sheaf the person who cuts or binds it. Thus at Hermsdorf in Silesia it used to be the regu-lar practice to tie up in the last sheaf the woman who had bound it. At Weiden, in Bavaria, it isthe cutter, not the binder, of the last sheaf who is tied up in it. Here the person wrapt up in thecorn represents the corn-spirit, exactly as a person wrapt in branches or leaves representsthe tree-spirit.The last sheaf, designated as the Old Woman, is often distinguished from the other sheavesby its size and weight. Thus in some villages of West Prussia the Old Woman is made twiceas long and thick as a common sheaf, and a stone is fastened in the middle of it. Sometimesit is made so heavy that a man can barely lift it. At Alt-Pillau, in Samland, eight or ninesheaves are often tied together to make the Old Woman, and the man who sets it up grum-bles at its weight. At Itzgrund, in Saxe-Coburg, the last sheaf, called the Old Woman, is madelarge with the express intention of thereby securing a good crop next year. Thus the customof making the last sheaf unusually large or heavy is a charm, working by sympathetic magic,to ensure a large and heavy crop at the following harvest.In Scotland, when the last corn was cut after Hallowmas, the female figure made out of it wassometimes called the Carlin or Carline, that is, the Old Woman. But if cut before Hallowmas, itwas called the Maiden; if cut after sunset, it was called the Witch, being supposed to bringPage 312"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"bad luck. Among the Highlanders of Scotland the last corn cut at harvest is known either asthe Old Wife (Cailleach) or as the Maiden; on the whole the former name seems to prevail inthe western and the latter in the central and eastern districts. Of the Maiden we shall speakpresently; here we are dealing with the Old Wife. The following general account of the customis given by a careful and well-informed enquirer, the Rev. J. G. Campbell, minister of theremote Hebridean island of Tiree: “The Harvest Old Wife (a Cailleach). In harvest, there wasa struggle to escape from being the last done with the shearing, and when tillage in commonexisted, instances were known of a ridge being left unshorn (no person would claim it)because of it being behind the rest. The fear entertained was that of having the ‘famine of thefarm’ (gort a bhaile), in the shape of an imaginary old woman (cailleach), to feed till next har-vest. Much emulation and amusement arose from the fear of this old woman.... The first donemade a doll of some blades of corn, which was called the ‘old wife,’ and sent it to his nearestneighbour. He in turn, when ready, passed it to another still less expeditious, and the person itlast remained with had ‘the old woman’ to keep for that year.”In the island of Islay the last corn cut goes by the name of the Old Wife (Cailleach), and whenshe has done her duty at harvest she is hung up on the wall and stays there till the timecomes to plough the fields for the next year’s crop. Then she is taken down, and on the firstday when the men go to plough she is divided among them by the mistress of the house.They take her in their pockets and give her to the horses to eat when they reach the field.This is supposed to secure good luck for the next harvest, and is understood to be the properend of the Old Wife.Usages of the same sort are reported from Wales. Thus in North Pembrokeshire a tuft of thelast corn cut, from six to twelve inches long, is plaited and goes by the name of the Hag(wrach); and quaint old customs used to be practised with it within the memory of many per-sons still alive. Great was the excitement among the reapers when the last patch of standingcorn was reached. All in turn threw their sickles at it, and the one who succeeded in cutting itreceived a jug of home-brewed ale. The Hag (wrach) was then hurriedly made and taken to aneighbouring farm, where the reapers were still busy at their work. This was generally doneby the ploughman; but he had to be very careful not to be observed by his neighbours, for ifthey saw him coming and had the least suspicion of his errand they would soon make himretrace his steps. Creeping stealthily up behind a fence he waited till the foreman of hisneighbour’s reapers was just opposite him and within easy reach. Then he suddenly threwthe Hag over the fence and, if possible, upon the foreman’s sickle. On that he took to hisheels and made off as fast as he could run, and he was a lucky man if he escaped withoutbeing caught or cut by the flying sickles which the infuriated reapers hurled after him. In othercases the Hag was brought home to the farmhouse by one of the reapers. He did his best tobring it home dry and without being observed; but he was apt to be roughly handled by thepeople of the house, if they suspected his errand. Sometimes they stripped him of most of hisclothes, sometimes they would drench him with water which had been carefully stored inbuckets and pans for the purpose. If, however, he succeeded in bringing the Hag in dry andunobserved, the master of the house had to pay him a small fine; or sometimes a jug of beer“from the cask next to the wall,” which seems to have commonly held the best beer, would bedemanded by the bearer. The Hag was then carefully hung on a nail in the hall or elsewhereand kept there all the year. The custom of bringing in the Hag (wrach) into the house andhanging it up still exists in some farms of North Pembrokeshire, but the ancient ceremonieswhich have just been described are now discontinued.In County Antrim, down to some years ago, when the sickle was finally expelled by the reap-Page 313"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"ing machine, the few stalks of corn left standing last on the field were plaited together; thenthe reapers, blindfolded, threw their sickles at the plaited corn, and whoever happened to cutit through took it home with him and put it over his door. This bunch of corn was called theCarley—probably the same word as Carlin.Similar customs are observed by Slavonic peoples. Thus in Poland the last sheaf is common-ly called the Baba, that is, the Old Woman. “In the last sheaf,” it is said, “sits the Baba.” Thesheaf itself is also called the Baba, and is sometimes composed of twelve smaller sheaveslashed together. In some parts of Bohemia the Baba, made out of the last sheaf, has the fig-ure of a woman with a great straw hat. It is carried home on the last harvest-waggon anddelivered, along with a garland, to the farmer by two girls. In binding the sheaves the womenstrive not to be last, for she who binds the last sheaf will have a child next year. Sometimesthe harvesters call out to the woman who binds the last sheaf, “She has the Baba,” or “She isthe Baba.” In the district of Cracow, when a man binds the last sheaf, they say, “TheGrandfather is sitting in it”; when a woman binds it, they say, “The Baba is sitting in it,” andthe woman herself is wrapt up in the sheaf, so that only her head projects out of it. Thusencased in the sheaf, she is carried on the last harvest-waggon to the house, where she isdrenched with water by the whole family. She remains in the sheaf till the dance is over, andfor a year she retains the name of Baba.In Lithuania the name for the last sheaf is Boba (Old Woman), answering to the Polish nameBaba. The Boba is said to sit in the corn which is left standing last. The person who binds thelast sheaf or digs the last potato is the subject of much banter, and receives and long retainsthe name of the Old Rye-woman or the Old Potato-woman. The last sheaf—the Boba—ismade into the form of a woman, carried solemnly through the village on the last harvest-wag-gon, and drenched with water at the farmer’s house; then every one dances with it.In Russia also the last sheaf is often shaped and dressed as a woman, and carried withdance and song to the farmhouse. Out of the last sheaf the Bulgarians make a doll whichthey call the Corn-queen or Corn-mother; it is dressed in a woman’s shirt, carried round thevillage, and then thrown into the river in order to secure plenty of rain and dew for the nextyear’s crop. Or it is burned and the ashes strew on the fields, doubtless to fertilise them. Thename Queen, as applied to the last sheaf, has its analogies in Central and Northern Europe.Thus, in the Salzburg district of Austria, at the end of the harvest a great procession takesplace, in which a Queen of the Corn-ears (Ährenkönigin) is drawn along in a little carriage byyoung fellows. The custom of the Harvest Queen appears to have been common in England.Milton must have been familiar with it, for in Paradise Lost he says: “Adam the while Waiting desirous her return, had wove Of choicest flow’rs a garland to adorn Her tresses, and her rural labours crown, As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen.”Often customs of this sort are practised, not on the harvest-field but on the threshing-floor.The spirit of the corn, fleeing before the reapers as they cut down the ripe grain, quits thereaped corn and takes refuge in the barn, where it appears in the last sheaf threshed, eitherto perish under the blows of the flail or to flee thence to the still unthreshed corn of a neigh-bouring farm. Thus the last corn to be threshed is called the Mother-Corn or the Old Woman.Sometimes the person who gives the last stroke with the flail is called the Old Woman, and isPage 314"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"wrapt in the straw of the last sheaf, or has a bundle of straw fastened on his back. Whetherwrapt in the straw or carrying it on his back, he is carted through the village amid generallaughter. In some districts of Bavaria, Thüringen, and elsewhere, the man who threshes thelast sheaf is said to have the Old Woman or the Old Corn-woman; he is tied up in straw, car-ried or carted about the village, and set down at last on the dunghill, or taken to the thresh-ing-floor of a neighbouring farmer who has not finished his threshing. In Poland the man whogives the last stroke at threshing is called Baba (Old Woman); he is wrapt in corn andwheeled through the village. Sometimes in Lithuania the last sheaf is not threshed, but isfashioned into female shape and carried to the barn of a neighbour who has not finished histhreshing.In some parts of Sweden, when a stranger woman appears on the threshing-floor, a flail isput round her body, stalks of corn are wound round her neck, a crown of ears is placed onher head, and the threshers call out, “Behold the Corn-woman.” Here the stranger woman,thus suddenly appearing, is taken to be the corn-spirit who has just been expelled by the flailsfrom the corn-stalks. In other cases the farmer’s wife represents the corn-spirit. Thus in theCommune of Saligné (Vendée), the farmer’s wife, along with the last sheaf, is tied up in asheet, placed on a litter, and carried to the threshing machine, under which she is shoved.Then the woman is drawn out and the sheaf is threshed by itself, but the woman is tossed inthe sheet, as if she were being winnowed. It would be impossible to express more clearly theidentification of the woman with the corn than by this graphic imitation of threshing and win-nowing her.In these customs the spirit of the ripe corn is regarded as old, or at least as of mature age.Hence the names of Mother, Grandmother, Old Woman, and so forth. But in other cases thecorn-spirit is conceived as young. Thus at Saldern, near Wolfenbuttel, when the rye has beenreaped, three sheaves are tied together with a rope so as to make a puppet with the cornears for a head. This puppet is called the Maiden or the Corn-maiden. Sometimes the corn-spirit is conceived as a child who is separated from its mother by the stroke of the sickle. Thislast view appears in the Polish custom of calling out to the man who cuts the last handful ofcorn, “You have cut the navel-string.” In some districts of West Prussia the figure made out ofthe last sheaf is called the Bastard, and a boy is wrapt up in it. The woman who binds the lastsheaf and represents the Corn-mother is told that she is about to be brought to bed; she crieslike a woman in travail, and an old woman in the character of grandmother acts as midwife. Atlast a cry is raised that the child is born; whereupon the boy who is tied up in the sheaf whim-pers and squalls like an infant. The grandmother wraps a sack, in imitation of swaddlingbands, round the pretended baby, who is carried joyfully to the barn, lest he should catch coldin the open air. In other parts of North Germany the last sheaf, or the puppet made out of it, iscalled the Child, the Harvest-Child, and so on, and they call out to the woman who binds thelast sheaf, “you are getting the child.”In some parts of Scotland, as well as in the north of England, the last handful of corn cut onthe harvest-field was called the kirn, and the person who carried it off was said “to win thekirn.” It was then dressed up like a child’s doll and went by the name of the kirn-baby, thekirn-doll, or the Maiden. In Berwickshire down to about the middle of the nineteenth centurythere was an eager competition among the reapers to cut the last bunch of standing corn.They gathered round it at a little distance and threw their sickles in turn at it, and the manwho succeeded in cutting it through gave it to the girl he preferred. She made the corn so cutinto a kirn-dolly and dressed it, and the doll was then taken to the farmhouse and hung upthere till the next harvest, when its place was taken by the new kirn-dolly. At Spottiswoode inPage 315"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Berwickshire the reaping of the last corn at harvest was called “cutting the Queen” almost asoften as “cutting the kirn.” The mode of cutting it was not by throwing sickles. One of thereapers consented to be blindfolded, and having been given a sickle in his hand and turnedtwice or thrice about by his fellows, he was bidden to go and cut the kirn. His groping aboutand making wild strokes in the air with his sickle excited much hilarity. When he had tiredhimself out in vain and given up the task as hopeless, another reaper was blindfolded andpursued the quest, and so on, one after the other, till at last the kirn was cut. The successfulreaper was tossed up in the air with three cheers by his brother harvesters. To decorate theroom in which the kirn-supper was held at Spottiswoode as well as the granary, where thedancing took place, two women made kirn-dollies or Queens every year; and many of theserustic effigies of the corn-spirit might be seen hanging up together.In some parts of the Highlands of Scotland the last handful of corn that is cut by the reaperson any particular farm is called the Maiden, or in Gaelic Maidhdeanbuain, literally, “the shornMaiden.” Superstitions attach to the winning of the Maiden. If it is got by a young person, theythink it an omen that he or she will be married before another harvest. For that or other rea-sons there is a strife between the reapers as to who shall get the Maiden, and they resort tovarious stratagems for the purpose of securing it. One of them, for example, will often leave ahandful of corn uncut and cover it up with earth to hide it from the other reapers, till all therest of the corn on the field is cut down. Several may try to play the same trick, and the onewho is coolest and holds out longest obtains the coveted distinction. When it has been cut,the Maiden is dressed with ribbons into a sort of doll and affixed to a wall of the farmhouse. Inthe north of Scotland the Maiden is carefully preserved till Yule morning, when it is dividedamong the cattle “to make them thrive all the year round.” In the neighbourhood ofBalquhidder, Perthshire, the last handful of corn is cut by the youngest girl on the field, and ismade into the rude form of a female doll, clad in a paper dress, and decked with ribbons. It iscalled the Maiden, and is kept in the farmhouse, generally above the chimney, for a goodwhile, sometimes till the Maiden of the next year is brought in. The writer of this book wit-nessed the ceremony of cutting the Maiden at Balquhidder in September 1888. A lady friendinformed me that as a young girl she cut the Maiden several times at the request of thereapers in the neighbourhood of Perth. The name of the Maiden was given to the last handfulof standing corn; a reaper held the top of the bunch while she cut it. Afterwards the bunchwas plaited, decked with ribbons, and hung up in a conspicuous place on the wall of thekitchen till the next Maiden was brought in. The harvest-supper in this neighbourhood wasalso called the Maiden; the reapers danced at it.On some farms on the Gareloch, in Dumbartonshire, about the year 1830, the last handful ofstanding corn was called the Maiden. It was divided in two, plaited, and then cut with the sick-le by a girl, who, it was thought, would be lucky and would soon be married. When it was cutthe reapers gathered together and threw their sickles in the air. The Maiden was dressed withribbons and hung in the kitchen near the roof, where it was kept for several years with thedate attached. Sometimes five or six Maidens might be seen hanging at once on hooks. Theharvest-supper was called the Kirn. In other farms on the Gareloch the last handful of cornwas called the Maidenhead or the Head; it was neatly plaited, sometimes decked with rib-bons, and hung in the kitchen for a year, when the grain was given to the poultry.In Aberdeenshire “the last sheaf cut, or ‘Maiden,’ is carried home in merry procession by theharvesters. It is then presented to the mistress of the house, who dresses it up to be pre-served till the first mare foals. The Maiden is then taken down and presented to the mare asits first food. The neglect of this would have untoward effects upon the foal, and disastrousPage 316"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"consequences upon farm operations generally for the season.” In the north-east ofAberdeenshire the last sheaf is commonly called the clyack sheaf. It used to be cut by theyoungest girl present and was dressed as a woman. Being brought home in triumph, it waskept till Christmas morning, and then given to a mare in foal, if there was one on the farm, or,if there was not, to the oldest cow in calf. Elsewhere the sheaf was divided between all thecows and their calves or between all the horses and the cattle of the farm. In Fifeshire thelast handful of corn, known as the Maiden, is cut by a young girl and made into the rude fig-ure of a doll, tied with ribbons, by which it is hung on the wall of the farm-kitchen till the nextspring. The custom of cutting the Maiden at harvest was also observed in Inverness-shire andSutherlandshire.Asomewhat maturer but still youthful age is assigned to the corn-spirit by the appellations ofBride, Oats-bride, and Wheat-bride, which in Germany are sometimes bestowed both on thelast sheaf and on the woman who binds it. At wheat-harvest near Müglitz, in Moravia, a smallportion of the wheat is left standing after all the rest has been reaped. This remnant is thencut, amid the rejoicing of the reapers, by a young girl who wears a wreath of wheaten ears onher head and goes by the name of the Wheat-bride. It is supposed that she will be a realbride that same year. Near Roslin and Stonehaven, in Scotland, the last handful of corn cut“got the name of ‘the bride,’ and she was placed over the bress or chimney-piece; she had aribbon tied below her numerous ears, and another round her waist.”Sometimes the idea implied by the name of Bride is worked out more fully by representingthe productive powers of vegetation as bride and bridegroom. Thus in the Vorharz an Oats-man and an Oats-woman, swathed in straw, dance at the harvest feast. In South Saxony anOats-bridegroom and an Oats-bride figure together at the harvest celebration. The Oats-bridegroom is a man completely wrapt in oats-straw; the Oats-bride is a man dressed inwoman’s clothes, but not wrapt in straw. They are drawn in a waggon to the ale-house, wherethe dance takes place. At the beginning of the dance the dancers pluck the bunches of oatsone by one from the Oats-bridegroom, while he struggles to keep them, till at last he is com-pletely stript of them and stands bare, exposed to the laughter and jests of the company. InAustrian Silesia the ceremony of “the Wheat-bride” is celebrated by the young people at theend of the harvest. The woman who bound the last sheaf plays the part of the Wheat-bride,wearing the harvest-crown of wheat ears and flowers on her head. Thus adorned, standingbeside her Bridegroom in a waggon and attended by bridesmaids, she is drawn by a pair ofoxen, in full imitation of a marriage procession, to the tavern, where the dancing is kept up tillmorning. Somewhat later in the season the wedding of the Oats-bride is celebrated with thelike rustic pomp. About Neisse, in Silesia, an Oats-king and an Oats-queen, dressed upquaintly as a bridal pair, are seated on a harrow and drawn by oxen into the village.In these last instances the corn-spirit is personified in double form as male and female. Butsometimes the spirit appears in a double female form as both old and young, correspondingexactly to the Greek Demeter and Persephone, if my interpretation of these goddesses isright. We have seen that in Scotland, especially among the Gaelic-speaking population, thelast corn cut is sometimes called the Old Wife and sometimes the Maiden. Now there areparts of Scotland in which both an Old Wife (Cailleach) and a Maiden are cut at harvest. Theaccounts of this custom are not quite clear and consistent, but the general rule seems to bethat, where both a Maiden and an Old Wife (Cailleach) are fashioned out of the reaped cornat harvest, the Maiden is made out of the last stalks left standing, and is kept by the farmeron whose land it was cut; while the Old Wife is made out of other stalks, sometimes out of thefirst stalks cut, and is regularly passed on to a laggard farmer who happens to be still reapingPage 317"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"after his brisker neighbour has cut all his corn. Thus while each farmer keeps his ownMaiden, as the embodiment of the young and fruitful spirit of the corn, he passes on the OldWife as soon as he can to a neighbour, and so the old lady may make the round of all thefarms in the district before she finds a place in which to lay her venerable head. The farmerwith whom she finally takes up her abode is of course the one who has been the last of allthe countryside to finish reaping his crops, and thus the distinction of entertaining her is ratheran invidious one. He is thought to be doomed to poverty or to be under the obligation of “pro-viding for the dearth of the township” in the ensuing season. Similarly we saw that inPembrokeshire, where the last corn cut is called, not the Maiden, but the Hag, she is passedon hastily to a neighbour who is still at work in his fields and who receives his aged visitorwith anything but a transport of joy. If the Old Wife represents the corn-spirit of the past year,as she probably does wherever she is contrasted with and opposed to a Maiden, it is naturalenough that her faded charms should have less attractions for the husbandman than thebuxom form of her daughter, who may be expected to become in her turn the mother of thegolden grain when the revolving year has brought round another autumn. The same desire toget rid of the effete Mother of the Corn by palming her off on other people comes out clearlyin some of the customs observed at the close of threshing, particularly in the practice of pass-ing on a hideous straw puppet to a neighbour farmer who is still threshing his corn.The harvest customs just described are strikingly analogous to the spring customs which wereviewed in an earlier part of this work. (1) As in the spring customs the tree-spirit is repre-sented both by a tree and by a person, so in the harvest customs the corn-spirit is represent-ed both by the last sheaf and by the person who cuts or binds or threshes it. The equivalenceof the person to the sheaf is shown by giving him or her the same name as the sheaf; bywrapping him or her in it; and by the rule observed in some places, that when the sheaf iscalled the Mother, it must be made up into human shape by the oldest married woman, butthat when it is called the Maiden, it must be cut by the youngest girl. Here the age of the per-sonal representative of the corn-spirit corresponds with that of the supposed age of the corn-spirit, just as the human victims offered by the Mexicans to promote the growth of the maizevaried with the age of the maize. For in the Mexican, as in the European, custom the humanbeings were probably representatives of the corn-spirit rather than victims offered to it. (2)Again the same fertilising influence which the tree-spirit is supposed to exert over vegetation,cattle, and even women is ascribed to the corn-spirit. Thus, its supposed influence on vegeta-tion is shown by the practice of taking some of the grain of the last sheaf (in which the corn-spirit is regularly supposed to be present), and scattering it among the young corn in spring ormixing it with the seed-corn. Its influence on animals is shown by giving the last sheaf to amare in foal, to a cow in calf, and to horses at the first ploughing. Lastly, its influence onwomen is indicated by the custom of delivering the Mother-sheaf, made into the likeness of apregnant woman, to the farmer’s wife; by the belief that the woman who binds the last sheafwill have a child next year; perhaps, too, by the idea that the person who gets it will soon bemarried.Plainly, therefore, these spring and harvest customs are based on the same ancient modes ofthought, and form parts of the same primitive heathendom, which was doubtless practised byour forefathers long before the dawn of history. Amongst the marks of a primitive ritual wemay note the following:1. No special class of persons is set apart for the performance of the rites; in other words,there are no priests. The rites may be performed by any one, as occasion demands.Page 318"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"2. No special places are set apart for the performance of the rites; in other words, there areno temples. The rites may be performed anywhere, as occasion demands.3. Spirits, not gods, are recognised. (a) As distinguished from gods, spirits are restricted intheir operations to definite departments of nature. Their names are general, not proper. Theirattributes are generic, rather than individual; in other words, there is an indefinite number ofspirits of each class, and the individuals of a class are all much alike; they have no definitelymarked individuality; no accepted traditions are current as to their origin, life, adventures, andcharacter. (b) On the other hand gods, as distinguished from spirits, are not restricted to defi-nite departments of nature. It is true that there is generally some one department over whichthey preside as their special province; but they are not rigorously confined to it; they can exerttheir power for good or evil in many other spheres of nature and life. Again, they bear individ-ual or proper names, such as Demeter, Persephone, Dionysus; and their individual charactersand histories are fixed by current myths and the representations of art.4. The rites are magical rather than propitiatory. In other words, the desired objects areattained, not by propitiating the favour of divine beings through sacrifice, prayer, and praise,but by ceremonies which, as I have already explained, are believed to influence the course ofnature directly through a physical sympathy or resemblance between the rite and the effectwhich it is the intention of the rite to produce.Judged by these tests, the spring and harvest customs of our European peasantry deserve torank as primitive. For no special class of persons and no special places are set exclusivelyapart for their performance; they may be performed by any one, master or man, mistress ormaid, boy or girl; they are practised, not in temples or churches, but in the woods and mead-ows, beside brooks, in barns, on harvest fields and cottage floors. The supernatural beingswhose existence is taken for granted in them are spirits rather than deities: their functions arelimited to certain well-defined departments of nature: their names are general like the Barley-mother, the Old Woman, the Maiden, not proper names like Demeter, Persephone, Dionysus.Their generic attributes are known, but their individual histories and characters are not thesubject of myths. For they exist in classes rather than as individuals, and the members ofeach class are indistinguishable. For example, every farm has its Corn-mother, or its OldWoman, or its Maiden; but every Corn-mother is much like every other Corn-mother, and sowith the Old Women and Maidens. Lastly, in these harvests, as in the spring customs, the rit-ual is magical rather than propitiatory. This is shown by throwing the Corn-mother into theriver in order to secure rain and dew for the crops; by making the Old Woman heavy in orderto get a heavy crop next year; by strewing grain from the last sheaf amongst the young cropsin spring; and by giving the last sheaf to the cattle to make them thrive.Chapter XLVIThe Corn-Mother in Many Lands1. THE CORN-MOTHER IN MANY LANDSEUROPEAN peoples, ancient and modern, have not been singular in personifying the corn asa mother goddess. The same simple idea has suggested itself to other agricultural races indistant parts of the world, and has been applied by them to other indigenous cereals thanbarley and wheat. If Europe has its Wheat-mother and its Barley-mother, America has itsMaize-mother and the East Indies their Rice-mother. These personifications I will now illus-trate, beginning with the American personification of the maize.Page 319"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"We have seen that among European peoples it is a common custom to keep the plaited corn-stalks of the last sheaf, or the puppet which is formed out of them, in the farm-house fromharvest to harvest. The intention no doubt is, or rather originally was, by preserving the repre-sentative of the corn-spirit to maintain the spirit itself in life and activity throughout the year, inorder that the corn may grow and the crops be good. This interpretation of the custom is at allevents rendered highly probable by a similar custom observed by the ancient Peruvians, andthus described by the old Spanish historian Acosta: “They take a certain portion of the mostfruitful of the maize that grows in their farms, the which they put in a certain granary whichthey do call Pirua, with certain ceremonies, watching three nights; they put this maize in therichest garments they have, and being thus wrapped and dressed, they worship this Pirua,and hold it in great veneration, saying it is the mother of the maize of their inheritances, andthat by this means the maize augments and is preserved. In this month [the sixth month,answering to May] they make a particular sacrifice, and the witches demand of this Pirua if ithath strength sufficient to continue until the next year; and if it answers no, then they carrythis maize to the farm to burn, whence they brought it, according to every man’s power; thenthey make another Pirua, with the same ceremonies, saying that they renew it, to the end theseed of maize may not perish, and if it answers that it hath force sufficient to last longer, theyleave it until the next year. This foolish vanity continueth to this day, and it is very commonamongst the Indians to have these Piruas.”In this description of the custom there seems to be some error. Probably it was the dressed-up bunch of maize, not the granary (Pirua), which was worshipped by the Peruvians andregarded as the Mother of the Maize. This is confirmed by what we know of the Peruvian cus-tom from another source. The Peruvians, we are told, believed all useful plants to be animat-ed by a divine being who causes their growth. According to the particular plant, these divinebeings were called the Maize-mother (Zara-mama), the Quinoa-mother (Quinoa-mama), theCoca-mother (Coca-mama), and the Potato-mother (Axo-mama). Figures of these divinemothers were made respectively of ears of maize and leaves of the quinoa and coca plants;they were dressed in women’s clothes and worshipped. Thus the Maize-mother was repre-sented by a puppet made of stalks of maize dressed in full female attire; and the Indiansbelieved that “as mother, it had the power of producing and giving birth to much maize.”Probably, therefore, Acosta misunderstood his informant, and the Mother of the Maize whichhe describes was not the granary (Pirua), but the bunch of maize dressed in rich vestments.The Peruvian Mother of the Maize, like the harvest-Maiden at Balquhidder, was kept for ayear in order that by her means the corn might grow and multiply. But lest her strength mightnot suffice to last till the next harvest, she was asked in the course of the year how she felt,and if she answered that she felt weak, she was burned and a fresh Mother of the Maizemade, “to the end the seed of maize may not perish.” Here, it may be observed, we have astrong confirmation of the explanation already given of the custom of killing the god, bothperiodically and occasionally. The Mother of the maize was allowed, as a rule, to live througha year, that being the period during which her strength might reasonably be supposed to lastunimpaired; but on any symptom of her strength failing she was put to death, and a fresh andvigorous Mother of the Maize took her place, lest the maize which depended on her for itsexistence should languish and decay.2. THE RICE-MOTHER IN THE EAST INDIESIf the reader still feels any doubts as to the meaning of the harvest customs which have beenpractised within living memory by European peasants, these doubts may perhaps be dis-Page 320"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"pelled by comparing the customs observed at the rice-harvest by the Malays and Dyaks ofthe East Indies. For these Eastern peoples have not, like our peasantry, advanced beyondthe intellectual stage at which the customs originated; their theory and their practice are still inunison; for them the quaint rites which in Europe have long dwindled into mere fossils, thepastime of clowns and the puzzle of the learned, are still living realities of which they can ren-der an intelligible and truthful account. Hence a study of their beliefs and usages concerningthe rice may throw some light on the true meaning of the ritual of the corn in ancient Greeceand modern Europe.Now the whole of the ritual which the Malays and Dyaks observe in connexion with the rice isfounded on the simple conception of the rice as animated by a soul like that which these peo-ple attribute to mankind. They explain the phenomena of reproduction, growth, decay, anddeath in the rice on the same principles on which they explain the corresponding phenomenain human beings. They imagine that in the fibres of the plant, as in the body of a man, there isa certain vital element, which is so far independent of the plant that it may for a time be com-pletely separated from it without fatal effects, though if its absence be prolonged beyond cer-tain limits the plant will wither and die. This vital yet separable element is what, for the want ofa better word, we must call the soul of a plant, just as a similar vital and separable element iscommonly supposed to constitute the soul of man; and on this theory or myth of the plant-soul is built the whole worship of the cereals, just as on the theory or myth of the human soulis built the whole worship of the dead,—a towering superstructure reared on a slender andprecarious foundation.Believing the rice to be animated by a soul like that of a man, the Indonesians naturally treatit with the deference and the consideration which they show to their fellows. Thus theybehave towards the rice in bloom as they behave towards a pregnant woman; they abstainfrom firing guns or making loud noises in the field, lest they should so frighten the soul of therice that it would miscarry and bear no grain; and for the same reason they will not talk ofcorpses or demons in the rice-fields. Moreover, they feed the blooming rice with foods of vari-ous kinds which are believed to be wholesome for women with child; but when the rice-earsare just beginning to form, they are looked upon as infants, and women go through the fieldsfeeding them with rice-pap as if they were human babes. In such natural and obvious com-parisons of the breeding plant to a breeding woman, and of the young grain to a young child,is to be sought the origin of the kindred Greek conception of the Corn-mother and the Corn-daughter, Demeter and Persephone. But if the timorous feminine soul of the rice can befrightened into a miscarriage even by loud noises, it is easy to imagine what her feelings mustbe at harvest, when people are under the sad necessity of cutting down the rice with theknife. At so critical a season every precaution must be used to render the necessary surgicaloperation of reaping as inconspicuous and as painless as possible. For that reason the reap-ing of the seed-rice is done with knives of a peculiar pattern, such that the blades are hiddenin the reapers’ hands and do not frighten the rice-spirit till the very last moment, when herhead is swept off almost before she is aware; and from a like delicate motive the reapers atwork in the fields employ a special form of speech, which the rice-spirit cannot be expected tounderstand, so that she has no warning or inkling of what is going forward till the heads ofrice are safely deposited in the basket.Among the Indonesian peoples who thus personify the rice we may take the Kayans orBahaus of Central Borneo as typical. In order to secure and detain the volatile soul of the ricethe Kayans resort to a number of devices. Among the instruments employed for this purposeare a miniature ladder, a spatula, and a basket containing hooks, thorns, and cords. With thePage 321"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"spatula the priestess strokes the soul of the rice down the little ladder into the basket, whereit is naturally held fast by the hooks, the thorn, and the cord; and having thus captured andimprisoned the soul she conveys it into the rice-granary. Sometimes a bamboo box and a netare used for the same purpose. And in order to ensure a good harvest for the following year itis necessary not only to detain the soul of all the grains of rice which are safely stored in thegranary, but also to attract and recover the soul of all the rice that has been lost throughfalling to the earth or being eaten by deer, apes, and pigs. For this purpose instruments ofvarious sorts have been invented by the priests. One, for example, is a bamboo vessel pro-vided with four hooks made from the wood of a fruit-tree, by means of which the absent rice-soul may be hooked and drawn back into the vessel, which is then hung up in the house.Sometimes two hands carved out of the wood of a fruit-tree are used for the same purpose.And every time that a Kayan housewife fetches rice from the granary for the use of herhousehold, she must propitiate the souls of the rice in the granary, lest they should be angryat being robbed of their substance.The same need of securing the soul of the rice, if the crop is to thrive, is keenly felt by theKarens of Burma. When a rice-field does not flourish, they suppose that the soul (kelah) ofthe rice is in some way detained from the rice. If the soul cannot be called back, the crop willfail. The following formula is used in recalling the kelah (soul) of the rice: “O come, rice-kelah,come! Come to the field. Come to the rice. With seed of each gender, come. Come from theriver Kho, come from the river Kaw; from the place where they meet, come. Come from theWest, come from the East. From the throat of the bird, from the maw of the ape, from thethroat of the elephant. Come from the sources of rivers and their mouths. Come from thecountry of the Shan and Burman. From the distant kingdoms come. From all granaries come.O rice-kelah, come to the rice.”The Corn-mother of our European peasants has her match in the Rice-mother of theMinangkabauers of Sumatra. The Minangkabauers definitely attribute a soul to rice, and willsometimes assert that rice pounded in the usual way tastes better than rice ground in a mill,because in the mill the body of the rice was so bruised and battered that the soul has fledfrom it. Like the Javanese they think that the rice is under the special guardianship of afemale spirit called Saning Sari, who is conceived as so closely knit up with the plant that therice often goes by her name, as with the Romans the corn might be called Ceres. In particularSaning Sari is represented by certain stalks or grains called indoea padi, that is, literally,“Mother of Rice,” a name that is often given to the guardian spirit herself. This so-calledMother of Rice is the occasion of a number of ceremonies observed at the planting and har-vesting of the rice as well as during its preservation in the barn. When the seed of the rice isabout to be sown in the nursery or bedding-out ground, where under the wet system of culti-vation it is regularly allowed to sprout before being transplanted to the fields, the best grainsare picked out to form the Rice-mother. These are then sown in the middle of the bed, andthe common seed is planted round about them. The state of the Rice-mother is supposed toexert the greatest influence on the growth of the rice; if she droops or pines away, the harvestwill be bad in consequence. The woman who sows the Rice-mother in the nursery lets herhair hang loose and afterwards bathes, as a means of ensuring an abundant harvest. Whenthe time comes to transplant the rice from the nursery to the field, the Rice-mother receives aspecial place either in the middle or in a corner of the field, and a prayer or charm is utteredas follows: “Saning Sari, may a measure of rice come from a stalk of rice and a basketfulfrom a root; may you be frightened neither by lightning nor by passers-by! Sunshine makeyou glad; with the storm may you be at peace; and may rain serve to wash your face!” Whilethe rice is growing, the particular plant which was thus treated as the Rice-mother is lost sightPage 322"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"of; but before harvest another Rice-mother is found. When the crop is ripe for cutting, the old-est woman of the family or a sorcerer goes out to look for her. The first stalks seen to bendunder a passing breeze are the Rice-mother, and they are tied together but not cut until thefirst-fruits of the field have been carried home to serve as a festal meal for the family andtheir friends, nay even for the domestic animals; since it is Saning Sari’s pleasure that thebeasts also should partake of her good gifts. After the meal has been eaten, the Rice-motheris fetched home by persons in gay attire, who carry her very carefully under an umbrella in aneatly worked bag to the barn, where a place in the middle is assigned to her. Every onebelieves that she takes care of the rice in the barn and even multiplies it not uncommonly.When the Tomori of Central Celebes are about to plant the rice, they bury in the field somebetel as an offering to the spirits who cause the rice to grow. The rice that is planted roundthis spot is the last to be reaped at harvest. At the commencement of the reaping the stalks ofthis patch of rice are tied together into a sheaf, which is called “the Mother of the Rice” (inenopae), and offerings in the shape of rice, fowl’s liver, eggs, and other things are laid downbefore it. When all the rest of the rice in the field has been reaped, “the Mother of the Rice” iscut down and carried with due honour to the rice-barn, where it is laid on the floor, and all theother sheaves are piled upon it. The Tomori, we are told, regard the Mother of the Rice as aspecial offering made to the rice-spirit Omonga, who dwells in the moon. If that spirit is nottreated with proper respect, for example if the people who fetch rice from the barn are notdecently clad, he is angry and punishes the offenders by eating up twice as much rice in thebarn as they have taken out of it; some people have heard him smacking his lips in the barn,as he devoured the rice. On the other hand the Toradjas of Central Celebes, who also prac-tice the custom of the Rice-mother at harvest, regard her as the actual mother of the wholeharvest, and therefore keep her carefully, lest in her absence the garnered store of riceshould all melt away and disappear.Again, just as in Scotland the old and the young spirit of the corn are represented as an OldWife (Cailleach) and a Maiden respectively, so in the Malay Peninsula we find both the Rice-mother and her child represented by different sheaves or bundles of ears on the harvest-field.The ceremony of cutting and bringing home the Soul of the Rice was witnessed by Mr. W. W.Skeat at Chodoi in Selangor on the twenty-eighth of January 1897. The particular bunch orsheaf which was to serve as the Mother of the Rice-soul had previously been sought andidentified by means of the markings or shape of the ears. From this sheaf an aged sorceress,with much solemnity, cut a little bundle of seven ears, anointed them with oil, tied them roundwith parti-coloured thread, fumigated them with incense, and having wrapt them in a whitecloth deposited them in a little oval-shaped basket. These seven ears were the infant Soul ofthe Rice and the little basket was its cradle. It was carried home to the farmer’s house byanother woman, who held up an umbrella to screen the tender infant from the hot rays of thesun. Arrived at the house the Rice-child was welcomed by the women of the family, and laid,cradle and all, on a new sleepingmat with pillows at the head. After that the farmer’s wife wasinstructed to observe certain rules of taboo for three days, the rules being in many respectsidentical with those which have to be observed for three days after the birth of a real child.Something of the same tender care which is thus bestowed on the newly-born Rice-child isnaturally extended also to its parent, the sheaf from whose body it was taken. This sheaf,which remains standing in the field after the Rice-soul has been carried home and put to bed,is treated as a newly-made mother; that is to say, young shoots of trees are pounded togetherand scattered broadcast every evening for three successive days, and when the three daysare up you take the pulp of a coco-nut and what are called “goat-flowers,” mix them up, eatthem with a little sugar, and spit some of the mixture out among the rice. So after a real birthPage 323"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"the young shoots of the jack-fruit, the rose-apple, certain kinds of banana, and the thin pulp ofyoung coco-nuts are mixed with dried fish, salt, acid, prawn-condiment, and the like daintiesto form a sort of salad, which is administered to mother and child for three successive days.The last sheaf is reaped by the farmer’s wife, who carries it back to the house, where it isthreshed and mixed with the Rice-soul. The farmer then takes the Rice-soul and its basketand deposits it, together with the product of the last sheaf, in the big circular rice-bin used bythe Malays. Some grains from the Rice-soul are mixed with the seed which is to be sown inthe following year. In this Rice-mother and Rice-child of the Malay Peninsula we may see thecounterpart and in a sense the prototype of the Demeter and Persephone of ancient Greece.Once more, the European custom of representing the corn-spirit in the double form of brideand bridegroom has its parallel in a ceremony observed at the rice-harvest in Java. Beforethe reapers begin to cut the rice, the priest or sorcerer picks out a number of ears of rice,which are tied together, smeared with ointment, and adorned with flowers. Thus decked out,the ears are called the padi-pe&breve;ngantèn, that is, the Rice-bride and the Rice-bride-groom; their wedding feast is celebrated, and the cutting of the rice begins immediately after-wards. Later on, when the rice is being got in, a bridal chamber is partitioned off in the barn,and furnished with a new mat, a lamp, and all kinds of toilet articles. Sheaves of rice, to rep-resent the wedding guests, are placed beside the Rice-bride and the Rice-bridegroom. Not tillthis has been done may the whole harvest be housed in the barn. And for the first forty daysafter the rice has been housed, no one may enter the barn, for fear of disturbing the newly-wedded pair.In the islands of Bali and Lombok, when the time of harvest has come, the owner of the fieldhimself makes a beginning by cutting “the principal rice” with his own hands and binding itinto two sheaves, each composed of one hundred and eight stalks with their leaves attachedto them. One of the sheaves represents a man and the other a woman, and they are called“husband and wife.” The male sheaf is wound about with thread so that none of the leavesare visible, whereas the female sheaf has its leaves bent over and tied so as to resemble theroll of a woman’s hair. Sometimes, for further distinction, a necklace of rice-straw is tied roundthe female sheaf. When the rice is brought home from the field, the two sheaves representingthe husband and wife are carried by a woman on her head, and are the last of all to bedeposited in the barn. There they are laid to rest on a small erection or on a cushion of rice-straw. The whole arrangement, we are informed, has for its object to induce the rice toincrease and multiply in the granary, so that the owner may get more out of it than he put in.Hence when the people of Bali bring the two sheaves, the husband and wife, into the barn,they say, “Increase ye and multiply without ceasing.” When all the rice in the barn has beenused up, the two sheaves representing the husband and wife remain in the empty building tillthey have gradually disappeared or been devoured by mice. The pinch of hunger sometimesdrives individuals to eat up the rice of these two sheaves, but the wretches who do so areviewed with disgust by their fellows and branded as pigs and dogs. Nobody would ever sellthese holy sheaves with the rest of their profane brethren.The same notion of the propagation of the rice by a male and female power finds expressionamongst the Szis of Upper Burma. When the paddy, that is, the rice with the husks still on it,has been dried and piled in a heap for threshing, all the friends of the household are invitedto the threshing-floor, and food and drink are brought out. The heap of paddy is divided andone half spread out for threshing, while the other half is left piled up. On the pile food andspirits are set, and one of the elders, addressing “the father and mother of the paddy-plant,”prays for plenteous harvests in future, and begs that the seed may bear many fold. Then thePage 324"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"whole party eat, drink, and make merry. This ceremony at the threshing-floor is the only occa-sion when these people invoke “the father and mother of the paddy.”3. THE SPIRIT OF THE CORN EMBODIED IN HUMAN BEINGSThus the theory which recognises in the European Corn-mother, Corn-maiden, and so forth,the embodiment in vegetable form of the animating spirit of the crops is amply confirmed bythe evidence of peoples in other parts of the world, who, because they have lagged behindthe European races in mental development, retain for that very reason a keener sense of theoriginal motives for observing those rustic rites which among ourselves have sunk to the levelof meaningless survivals. The reader may, however, remember that according to Mannhardt,whose theory I am expounding, the spirit of the corn manifests itself not merely in vegetablebut also in human form; the person who cuts the last sheaf or gives the last stroke at thresh-ing passes for a temporary embodiment of the corn-spirit, just as much as the bunch of cornwhich he reaps or threshes. Now in the parallels which have been hitherto adduced from thecustoms of peoples outside Europe the spirit of the crops appears only in vegetable form. Itremains, therefore, to prove that other races besides our European peasantry have conceivedthe spirit of the crops as incorporate in or represented by living men and women. Such aproof, I may remind the reader, is germane to the theme of this book; for the more instanceswe discover of human beings representing in themselves the life or animating spirit of plants,the less difficulty will be felt at classing amongst them the King of the Wood at Nemi.The Mandans and Minnitarees of North America used to hold a festival in spring which theycalled the corn-medicine festival of the women. They thought that a certain Old Woman whoNever Dies made the crops to grow, and that, living somewhere in the south, she sent themigratory waterfowl in spring as her tokens and representatives. Each sort of bird represent-ed a special kind of crop cultivated by the Indians: the wild goose stood for the maize, thewild swan for the gourds, and the wild duck for the beans. So when the feathered messen-gers of the Old Woman began to arrive in spring the Indians celebrated the corn-medicinefestival of the women. Scaffolds were set up, on which the people hung dried meat and otherthings by way of offerings to the Old Woman; and on a certain day the old women of the tribe,as representatives of the Old Woman who Never Dies, assembled at the scaffolds each bear-ing in her hand an ear of maize fastened to a stick. They first planted these sticks in theground, then danced round the scaffolds, and finally took up the sticks again in their arms.Meanwhile old men beat drums and shook rattles as a musical accompaniment to the per-formance of the old women. Further, young women came and put dried flesh into the mouthsof the old women, for which they received in return a grain of the consecrated maize to eat.Three or four grains of the holy corn were also placed in the dishes of the young women, tobe afterwards carefully mixed with the seed-corn, which they were supposed to fertilise. Thedried flesh hung on the scaffold belonged to the old women, because they represented theOld Woman who Never Dies. A similar corn-medicine festival was held in autumn for the pur-pose of attracting the herds of buffaloes and securing a supply of meat. At that time everywoman carried in her arms an uprooted plant of maize. They gave the name of the OldWoman who Never Dies both to the maize and to those birds which they regarded as sym-bols of the fruits of the earth, and they prayed to them in autumn saying, “Mother, have pityon us! send us not the bitter cold too soon, lest we have not meat enough! let not all thegame depart, that we may have something for the winter!” In autumn, when the birds wereflying south, the Indians thought that they were going home to the Old Woman and taking toher the offerings that had been hung up on the scaffolds, especially the dried meat, which sheate. Here then we have the spirit or divinity of the corn conceived as an Old Woman and rep-Page 325"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"resented in bodily form by old women, who in their capacity of representatives receive someat least of the offerings which are intended for her.In some parts of India the harvest-goddess Gauri is represented at once by an unmarried girland by a bundle of wild balsam plants, which is made up into the figure of a woman anddressed as such with mask, garments, and ornaments. Both the human and the vegetablerepresentative of the goddess are worshipped, and the intention of the whole ceremonyappears to be to ensure a good crop of rice.4. THE DOUBLE PERSONIFICATION OF THE CORN AS MOTHER AND DAUGHTERCompared with the Corn-mother of Germany and the Harvest-maiden of Scotland, theDemeter and Persephone of Greece are late products of religious growth. Yet as members ofthe Aryan family the Greeks must at one time or another have observed harvest customs likethose which are still practised by Celts, Teutons, and Slavs, and which, far beyond the limitsof the Aryan world, have been practised by the Indians of Peru and many peoples of the EastIndies—a sufficient proof that the ideas on which these customs rest are not confined to anyone race, but naturally suggest themselves to all untutored peoples engaged in agriculture. Itis probable, therefore, that Demeter and Persephone, those stately and beautiful figures ofGreek mythology, grew out of the same simple beliefs and practices which still prevail amongour modern peasantry, and that they were represented by rude dolls made out of the yellowsheaves on many a harvest-field long before their breathing images were wrought in bronzeand marble by the master hands of Phidias and Praxiteles. A reminiscence of that oldentime—a scent, so to say, of the harvest-field—lingered to the last in the title of the Maiden(Kore) by which Persephone was commonly known. Thus if the prototype of Demeter is theCorn-mother of Germany, the prototype of Persephone is the Harvest-maiden which, autumnafter autumn, is still made from the last sheaf on the Braes of Balquhidder. Indeed, if we knewmore about the peasant-farmers of ancient Greece, we should probably find that even in clas-sical times they continued annually to fashion their Corn-mothers (Demeters) and Maidens(Persephones) out of the ripe corn on the harvest-fields. But unfortunately the Demeter andPersephone whom we know were the denizens of towns, the majestic inhabitants of lordlytemples; it was for such divinities alone that the refined writers of antiquity had eyes; theuncouth rites performed by rustics amongst the corn were beneath their notice. Even if theynoticed them, they probably never dreamed of any connexion between the puppet of corn-stalks on the sunny stubble-field and the marble divinity in the shady coolness of the temple.Still the writings even of these town-bred and cultured persons afford us an occasionalglimpse of a Demeter as rude as the rudest that a remote German village can show. Thus thestory that Iasion begat a child Plutus (“wealth,” “abundance”) by Demeter on a thrice-ploughed field, may be compared with the West Prussian custom of the mock birth of a childon the harvest-field. In this Prussian custom the pretended mother represents the Corn-moth-er (Z&caron;ytniamatka); the pretended child represents the Corn-baby, and the whole cere-mony is a charm to ensure a crop next year. The custom and the legend alike point to anolder practice of performing, among the sprouting crops in spring or the stubble in autumn,one of those real or mimic acts of procreation by which, as we have seen, primitive man oftenseeks to infuse his own vigorous life into the languid or decaying energies of nature. Anotherglimpse of the savage under the civilised Demeter will be afforded farther on, when we cometo deal with another aspect of those agricultural divinities. The reader may have observed that in modern folk-customs the corn-spirit is generally repre-sented either by a Corn-mother (Old Woman, etc.) or by a Maiden (Harvest-child, etc.), notPage 326"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"both by a Corn-mother and by a Maiden. Why then did the Greeks represent the corn both asa mother and a daughter?In the Breton custom the mother-sheaf—a large figure made out of the last sheaf with a smallcorn-doll inside of it—clearly represents both the Corn-mother and the Corn-daughter, the lat-ter still unborn. Again, in the Prussian custom just referred to, the woman who plays the partof Corn-mother represents the ripe grain; the child appears to represent next year’s corn,which may be regarded, naturally enough, as the child of this year’s corn, since it is from theseed of this year’s harvest that next year’s crop will spring. Further, we have seen that amongthe Malays of the Peninsula and sometimes among the Highlanders of Scotland the spirit ofthe grain is represented in double female form, both as old and young, by means of earstaken alike from the ripe crop: in Scotland the old spirit of the corn appears as the Carline orCailleach, the young spirit as the Maiden; while among the Malays of the Peninsula the twospirits of the rice are definitely related to each other as mother and child. Judged by theseanalogies Demeter would be the ripe crop of this year; Persephone would be the seed-corntaken from it and sown in autumn, to reappear in spring. The descent of Persephone into thelower world would thus be a mythical expression for the sowing of the seed; her reappear-ance in spring would signify the sprouting of the young corn. In this way the Persephone ofone year becomes the Demeter of the next, and this may very well have been the originalform of the myth. But when with the advance of religious thought the corn came to be person-ified no longer as a being that went through the whole cycle of birth, growth, reproduction,and death within a year, but as an immortal goddess, consistency required that one of the twopersonifications, the mother or the daughter, should be sacrificed. However, the double con-ception of the corn as mother and daughter may have been too old and too deeply rooted inthe popular mind to be eradicated by logic, and so room had to be found in the reformedmyth both for mother and daughter. This was done by assigning to Persephone the characterof the corn sown in autumn and sprouting in spring, while Demeter was left to play the some-what vague part of the heavy mother of the corn, who laments its annual disappearanceunderground, and rejoices over its reappearance in spring. Thus instead of a regular succes-sion of divine beings, each living a year and then giving birth to her successor, the reformedmyth exhibits the conception of two divine and immortal beings, one of whom annually disap-pears into and reappears from the ground, while the other has little to do but to weep andrejoice at the appropriate seasons.This theory of the double personification of the corn in Greek myth assumes that both person-ifications (Demeter and Persephone) are original. But if we suppose that the Greek mythstarted with a single personification, the aftergrowth of a second personification may perhapsbe explained as follows. On looking over the harvest customs which have been passed underreview, it may be noticed that they involve two distinct conceptions of the corn-spirit. Forwhereas in some of the customs the corn-spirit is treated as immanent in the corn, in others itis regarded as external to it. Thus when a particular sheaf is called by the name of the corn-spirit, and is dressed in clothes and handled with reverence, the spirit is clearly regarded asimmanent in the corn. But when the spirit is said to make the crops grow by passing throughthem, or to blight the grain of those against whom she has a grudge, she is apparently con-ceived as distinct from, though exercising power over, the corn. Conceived in the latter modethe corn-spirit is in a fair way to become a deity of the corn, if she has not become so already.Of these two conceptions, that of the cornspirit as immanent in the corn is doubtless theolder, since the view of nature as animated by indwelling spirits appears to have generallypreceded the view of it as controlled by external deities; to put it shortly, animism precedesdeism. In the harvest customs of our European peasantry the corn-spirit seems to be con-Page 327"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"ceived now as immanent in the corn and now as external to it. In Greek mythology, on theother hand, Demeter is viewed rather as the deity of the corn than as the spirit immanent in it.The process of thought which leads to the change from the one mode of conception to theother is anthropomorphism, or the gradual investment of the immanent spirits with more andmore of the attributes of humanity. As men emerge from savagery the tendency to humanisetheir divinities gains strength; and the more human these become the wider is the breachwhich severs them from the natural objects of which they were at first merely the animatingspirits or souls. But in the progress upwards from savagery men of the same generation donot march abreast; and though the new anthropomorphic gods may satisfy the religious wantsof the more developed intelligences, the backward members of the community will cling bypreference to the old animistic notions. Now when the spirit of any natural object such as thecorn has been invested with human qualities, detached from the object, and converted into adeity controlling it, the object itself is, by the withdrawal of its spirit, left inanimate; it becomes,so to say, a spiritual vacuum. But the popular fancy, intolerant of such a vacuum, in otherwords, unable to conceive anything as inanimate, immediately creates a fresh mythical being,with which it peoples the vacant object. Thus the same natural object comes to be represent-ed in mythology by two distinct beings: first by the old spirit now separated from it and raisedto the rank of a deity; second, by the new spirit, freshly created by the popular fancy to supplythe place vacated by the old spirit on its elevation to a higher sphere. In such cases the prob-lem for mythology is, having got two distinct personifications of the same object, what to dowith them? How are their relations to each other to be adjusted, and room found for both inthe mythological system? When the old spirit or new deity is conceived as creating or produc-ing the object in question, the problem is easily solved. Since the object is believed to be pro-duced by the old spirit, and animated by the new one, the latter, as the soul of the object,must also owe its existence to the former; thus the old spirit will stand to the new one as pro-ducer to produced, that is, in mythology, as parent to child, and if both spirits are conceivedas female, their relation will be that of mother and daughter. In this way, starting from a singlepersonification of the corn as female, mythic fancy might in time reach a double personifica-tion of it as mother and daughter. It would be very rash to affirm that this was the way inwhich the myth of Demeter and Persephone actually took shape; but it seems a legitimateconjecture that the reduplication of deities, of which Demeter and Persephone furnish anexample, may sometimes have arisen in the way indicated. For example, among the pairs ofdeities dealt with in a former part of this work, it has been shown that there are grounds forregarding both Isis and her companion god Osiris as personifications of the corn. On thehypothesis just suggested, Isis would be the old corn-spirit, and Osiris would be the newerone, whose relationship to the old spirit was variously explained as that of brother, husband,and son; for of course mythology would always be free to account for the coexistence of thetwo divinities in more ways than one. It must not, however, be forgotten that this proposedexplanation of such pairs of deities as Demeter and Persephone or Isis and Osiris is purelyconjectural, and is only given for what it is worth.Chapter XLVIILityerses1. SONGS OF THE CORN REAPERSIN the preceding pages an attempt has been made to show that in the Corn-mother andHarvest-maiden of Northern Europe we have the prototypes of Demeter and Persephone. Butan essential feature is still wanting to complete the resemblance. A leading incident in theGreek myth is the death and resurrection of Persephone; it is this incident which, coupledPage 328"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"with the nature of the goddess as a deity of vegetation, links the myth with the cults ofAdonis, Attis, Osiris, and Dionysus; and it is in virtue of this incident that the myth finds aplace in our discussion of the Dying God. It remains, therefore, to see whether the conceptionof the annual death and resurrection of a god, which figures so prominently in these greatGreek and Oriental worships, has not also its origin or its analogy in the rustic rites observedby reapers and vine-dressers amongst the corn-shocks and the vines.Our general ignorance of the popular superstitions and customs of the ancients has alreadybeen confessed. But the obscurity which thus hangs over the first beginnings of ancient reli-gion is fortunately dissipated to some extent in the present case. The worships of Osiris,Adonis, and Attis had their respective seats, as we have seen, in Egypt, Syria, and Phrygia;and in each of these countries certain harvest and vintage customs are known to have beenobserved, the resemblance of which to each other and to the national rites struck the ancientsthemselves, and, compared with the harvest customs of modern peasants and barbarians,seems to throw some light on the origin of the rites in question.It has been already mentioned, on the authority of Diodorus, that in ancient Egypt the reaperswere wont to lament over the first sheaf cut, invoking Isis as the goddess to whom they owedthe discovery of corn. To the plaintive song or cry sung or uttered by Egyptian reapers theGreeks gave the name of Maneros, and explained the name by a story that Maneros, theonly son of the first Egyptian king, invented agriculture, and, dying an untimely death, wasthus lamented by the people. It appears, however, that the name Maneros is due to a misun-derstanding of the formula maa-ne-hra, “Come to the house,” which has been discovered invarious Egyptian writings, for example in the dirge of Isis in the Book of the Dead. Hence wemay suppose that the cry maa-ne-hra was chanted by the reapers over the cut corn as adirge for the death of the corn-spirit (Isis or Osiris) and a prayer for its return. As the cry wasraised over the first ears reaped, it would seem that the corn-spirit was believed by theEgyptians to be present in the first corn cut and to die under the sickle. We have seen that inthe Malay Peninsula and Java the first ears of rice are taken to represent either the Soul ofthe Rice or the Rice-bride and the Rice-bridegroom. In parts of Russia the first sheaf is treat-ed much in the same way that the last sheaf is treated elsewhere. It is reaped by the mistressherself, taken home and set in the place of honour near the holy pictures; afterwards it isthreshed separately, and some of its grain is mixed with the next year’s seed-corn. InAberdeenshire, while the last corn cut was generally used to make the clyack sheaf, it wassometimes, though rarely, the first corn cut that was dressed up as a woman and carriedhome with ceremony.In Phoenicia and Western Asia a plaintive song, like that chanted by the Egyptian corn-reapers, was sung at the vintage and probably (to judge by analogy) also at harvest. ThisPhoenician song was called by the Greeks Linus or Ailinus and explained, like Maneros, as alament for the death of a youth named Linus. According to one story Linus was brought up bya shepherd, but torn to pieces by his dogs. But, like Maneros, the name Linus or Ailinusappears to have originated in a verbal misunderstanding, and to be nothing more than the cryai lanu, that is “Woe to us,” which the Phoenicians probably uttered in mourning for Adonis; atleast Sappho seems to have regarded Adonis and Linus as equivalent.In Bithynia a like mournful ditty, called Bormus or Borimus, was chanted by Mariandynianreapers. Bormus was said to have been a handsome youth, the son of King Upias or of awealthy and distinguished man. One summer day, watching the reapers at work in his fields,he went to fetch them a drink of water and was never heard of more. So the reapers soughtPage 329"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"for him, calling him in plaintive strains, which they continued to chant at harvest ever after-wards.2. KILLING THE CORN-SPIRITIn Phrygia the corresponding song, sung by harvesters both at reaping and at threshing, wascalled Lityerses. According to one story, Lityerses was a bastard son of Midas, King ofPhrygia, and dwelt at Celaenae. He used to reap the corn, and had an enormous appetite.When a stranger happened to enter the corn-field or to pass by it, Lityerses gave him plentyto eat and drink, then took him to the corn-fields on the banks of the Maeander and com-pelled him to reap along with him. Lastly, it was his custom to wrap the stranger in a sheaf,cut off his head with a sickle, and carry away his body, swathed in the corn-stalks. But at lastHercules undertook to reap with him, cut off his head with the sickle, and threw his body intothe river. As Hercules is reported to have slain Lityerses in the same way that Lityerses slewothers, we may infer that Lityerses used to throw the bodies of his victims into the river.According to another version of the story, Lityerses, a son of Midas, was wont to challengepeople to a reaping match with him, and if he vanquished them he used to thrash them; butone day he met with a stronger reaper, who slew him.There are some grounds for supposing that in these stories of Lityerses we have the descrip-tion of a Phrygian harvest custom in accordance with which certain persons, especiallystrangers passing the harvest field, were regularly regarded as embodiments of the corn-spir-it, and as such were seized by the reapers, wrapt in sheaves, and beheaded, their bodies,bound up in the corn-stalks, being after-wards thrown into water as a rain-charm. Thegrounds for this supposition are, first, the resemblance of the Lityerses story to the harvestcustoms of European peasantry, and, second, the frequency of human sacrifices offered bysavage races to promote the fertility of the fields. We will examine these grounds successive-ly, beginning with the former.In comparing the story with the harvest customs of Europe, three points deserve specialattention, namely: I. the reaping match and the binding of persons in the sheaves; II. thekilling of the corn-spirit or his representatives; III. the treatment of visitors to the harvest fieldor of strangers passing it.I. In regard to the first head, we have seen that in modern Europe the person who cuts orbinds or threshes the last sheaf is often exposed to rough treatment at the hands of his fel-low-labourers. For example, he is bound up in the last sheaf, and, thus encased, is carried orcarted about, beaten, drenched with water, thrown on a dunghill, and so forth. Or, if he isspared this horse-play, he is at least the subject of ridicule or is thought to be destined to suf-fer some misfortune in the course of the year. Hence the harvesters are naturally reluctant togive the last cut at reaping or the last stroke at threshing or to bind the last sheaf, andtowards the close of the work this reluctance produces an emulation among the labourers,each striving to finish his task as fast as possible, in order that he may escape the invidiousdistinction of being last. For example, in the Mittelmark district of Prussia, when the rye hasbeen reaped, and the last sheaves are about to be tied up, the binders stand in two rows fac-ing each other, every woman with her sheaf and her straw rope before her. At a given signalthey all tie up their sheaves, and the one who is the last to finish is ridiculed by the rest. Notonly so, but her sheaf is made up into human shape and called the Old Man, and she mustcarry it home to the farmyard, where the harvesters dance in a circle round her and it. Thenthey take the Old Man to the farmer and deliver it to him with the words, “We bring the OldPage 330"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Man to the Master. He may keep him till he gets a new one.” After that the Old Man is set upagainst a tree, where he remains for a long time, the butt of many jests. At Aschbach inBavaria, when the reaping is nearly finished, the reapers say, “Now, we will drive out the OldMan.” Each of them sets himself to reap a patch of corn as fast as he can; he who cuts thelast handful or the last stalk is greeted by the rest with an exulting cry, “You have the OldMan.” Sometimes a black mask is fastened on the reaper’s face and he is dressed inwoman’s clothes; or if the reaper is a woman, she is dressed in man’s clothes. A dance fol-lows. At the supper the Old Man gets twice as large a portion of the food as the others. Theproceedings are similar at threshing; the person who gives the last stroke is said to have theOld Man. At the supper given to the threshers he has to eat out of the cream-ladle and todrink a great deal. Moreover, he is quizzed and teased in all sorts of ways till he frees himselffrom further annoyance by treating the others to brandy or beer.These examples illustrate the contests in reaping, threshing, and binding which take placeamongst the harvesters, from their unwillingness to suffer the ridicule and discomfort incurredby the one who happens to finish his work last. It will be remembered that the person who islast at reaping, binding, or threshing, is regarded as the representative of the corn-spirit, andthis idea is more fully expressed by binding him or her in corn-stalks. The latter custom hasbeen already illustrated, but a few more instances may be added. At Kloxin, near Stettin, theharvesters call out to the woman who binds the last sheaf, “You have the Old Man, and mustkeep him.” As late as the first half of the nineteenth century the custom was to tie up thewoman herself in pease-straw, and bring her with music to the farmhouse, where the har-vesters danced with her till the pease-straw fell off. In other villages round Stettin, when thelast harvest-waggon is being loaded, there is a regular race amongst the women, each striv-ing not to be last. For she who places the last sheaf on the waggon is called the Old Man,and is completely swathed in corn-stalks; she is also decked with flowers, and flowers and ahelmet of straw are placed on her head. In solemn procession she carries the harvest-crownto the squire, over whose head she holds it while she utters a string of good wishes. At thedance which follows, the Old Man has the right to choose his, or rather her, partner; it is anhonour to dance with him. At Gommern, near Magdeburg, the reaper who cuts the last earsof corn is often wrapt up in corn-stalks so completely that it is hard to see whether there is aman in the bundle or not. Thus wrapt up he is taken by another stalwart reaper on his back,and carried round the field amidst the joyous cries of the harvesters. At Neuhausen, nearMerseburg, the person who binds the last sheaf is wrapt in ears of oats and saluted as theOatsman, whereupon the others dance round him. At Brie, Isle de France, the farmer himselfis tied up in the first sheaf. At Dingelstedt, in the district of Erfurt, down to the first half of thenineteenth century it was the custom to tie up a man in the last sheaf. He was called the OldMan, and was brought home on the last waggon, amid huzzas and music. On reaching thefarmyard he was rolled round the barn and drenched with water. At Nördlingen in Bavaria theman who gives the last stroke at threshing is wrapt in straw and rolled on the threshing-floor.In some parts of Oberpfalz, Bavaria, he is said to “get the Old Man,” is wrapt in straw, andcarried to a neighbour who has not yet finished his threshing. In Silesia the woman who bindsthe last sheaf has to submit to a good deal of horse-play. She is pushed, knocked down, andtied up in the sheaf, after which she is called the corn-puppet (Kornpopel).“In all these cases the idea is that the spirit of the corn—the Old Man of vegetation—is drivenout of the corn last cut or last threshed, and lives in the barn during the winter. At sowing-timehe goes out again to the fields to resume his activity as animating force among the sproutingcorn.”Page 331"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"II. Passing to the second point of comparison between the Lityerses story and European har-vest customs, we have now to see that in the latter the corn-spirit is often believed to be killedat reaping or threshing. In the Romsdal and other parts of Norway, when the haymaking isover, the people say that “the Old Hay-man has been killed.” In some parts of Bavaria theman who gives the last stroke at threshing is said to have killed the Corn-man, the Oats-man,or the Wheat-man, according to the crop. In the Canton of Tillot, in Lorraine, at threshing thelast corn the men keep time with their flails, calling out as they thresh, “We are killing the OldWoman! We are killing the Old Woman!” If there is an old woman in the house she is warnedto save herself, or she will be struck dead. Near Ragnit, in Lithuania, the last handful of cornis left standing by itself, with the words, “The Old Woman (Boba) is sitting in there.” Then ayoung reaper whets his scythe and, with a strong sweep, cuts down the handful. It is nowsaid of him that “he has cut off the Boba’s head”; and he receives a gratuity from the farmerand a jugful of water over his head from the farmer’s wife. According to another account,every Lithuanian reaper makes haste to finish his task; for the Old Rye-woman lives in thelast stalks, and whoever cuts the last stalks kills the Old Rye-woman, and by killing her hebrings trouble on himself. In Wilkischken, in the district of Tilsit, the man who cuts the lastcorn goes by the name of “the killer of the Rye-woman.” In Lithuania, again, the corn-spirit isbelieved to be killed at threshing as well as at reaping. When only a single pile of cornremains to be threshed, all the threshers suddenly step back a few paces, as if at the word ofcommand. Then they fall to work, plying their flails with the utmost rapidity and vehemence,till they come to the last bundle. Upon this they fling themselves with almost frantic fury,straining every nerve, and raining blows on it till the word “Halt!” rings out sharply from theleader. The man whose flail is the last to fall after the command to stop has been given isimmediately surrounded by all the rest, crying out that “he has struck the Old Rye-womandead.” He has to expiate the deed by treating them to brandy; and, like the man who cuts thelast corn, he is known as “the killer of the Old Rye-woman.” Sometimes in Lithuania the slaincorn-spirit was represented by a puppet. Thus a female figure was made out of corn-stalks,dressed in clothes, and placed on the threshing-floor, under the heap of corn which was to bethreshed last. Whoever thereafter gave the last stroke at threshing “struck the Old Womandead.” We have already met with examples of burning the figure which represents the corn-spirit. In the East Riding of Yorkshire a custom called “burning the Old Witch” is observed onthe last day of harvest. A small sheaf of corn is burnt on the field in a fire of stubble; peas areparched at the fire and eaten with a liberal allowance of ale; and the lads and lasses rompabout the flames and amuse themselves by blackening each other’s faces. Sometimes,again, the corn-spirit is represented by a man, who lies down under the last corn; it isthreshed upon his body, and the people say that “the Old Man is being beaten to death.” Wesaw that sometimes the farmer’s wife is thrust, together with the last sheaf, under the thresh-ing-machine, as if to thresh her, and that afterwards a pretence is made of winnowing her. AtVolders, in the Tyrol, husks of corn are stuck behind the neck of the man who gives the laststroke at threshing, and he is throttled with a straw garland. If he is tall, it is believed that thecorn will be tall next year. Then he is tied on a bundle and flung into the river. In Carinthia, thethresher who gave the last stroke, and the person who untied the last sheaf on the threshing-floor, are bound hand and foot with straw bands, and crowns of straw are placed on theirheads. Then they are tied, face to face, on a sledge, dragged through the village, and flunginto a brook. The custom of throwing the representative of the corn-spirit into a stream, likethat of drenching him with water, is, as usual, a rain-charm.III. Thus far the representatives of the corn-spirit have generally been the man or woman whocuts, binds, or threshes the last corn. We now come to the cases in which the corn-spirit isrepresented either by a stranger passing the harvest-field (as in the Lityerses tale), or by aPage 332"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"visitor entering it for the first time. All over Germany it is customary for the reapers or thresh-ers to lay hold of passing strangers and bind them with a rope made of corn-stalks, till theypay a forfeit; and when the farmer himself or one of his guests enters the field or the thresh-ing-floor for the first time, he is treated in the same way. Sometimes the rope is only tiedround his arm or his feet or his neck. But sometimes he is regularly swathed in corn. Thus atSolör in Norway, whoever enters the field, be he the master or a stranger, is tied up in a sheafand must pay a ransom. In the neighbourhood of Soest, when the farmer visits the flax-pullers for the first time, he is completely enveloped in flax. Passers-by are also surroundedby the women, tied up in flax, and compelled to stand brandy. At Nördlingen strangers arecaught with straw ropes and tied up in a sheaf till they pay a forfeit. Among the Germans ofHaselberg, in West Bohemia, as soon as a farmer had given the last corn to be threshed onthe threshing-floor, he was swathed in it and had to redeem himself by a present of cakes. Inthe canton of Putanges, in Normandy, a pretence of tying up the owner of the land in the lastsheaf of wheat is still practised, or at least was still practised some quarter of a century ago.The task falls to the women alone. They throw themselves on the proprietor, seize him by thearms, the legs, and the body, throw him to the ground, and stretch him on the last sheaf.Then a show is made of binding him, and the conditions to be observed at the harvest-supperare dictated to him. When he has accepted them, he is released and allowed to get up. AtBrie, Isle de France, when any one who does not belong to the farm passes by the harvest-field, the reapers give chase. If they catch him, they bind him in a sheaf an dbite him, oneafter the other, in the forehead, crying, “You shall carry the key of the field.” “To have the key”is an expression used by harvesters elsewhere in the sense of to cut or bind or thresh thelast sheaf; hence, it is equivalent to the phrases “You have the Old Man,” “You are the OldMan,” which are addressed to the cutter, binder, or thresher of the last sheaf. Therefore, whena stranger, as at Brie, is tied up in a sheaf and told that he will “carry the key of the field,” it isas much as to say that he is the Old Man, that is, an embodiment of the corn-spirit. In hop-picking, if a well-dressed stranger passes the hop-yard, he is seized by the women, tumbledinto the bin, covered with leaves, and not released till he has paid a fine.Thus, like the ancient Lityerses, modern European reapers have been wont to lay hold of apassing stranger and tie him up in a sheaf. It is not to be expected that they should completethe parallel by cutting off his head; but if they do not take such a strong step, their languageand gestures are at least indicative of a desire to do so. For instance, in Mecklenburg on thefirst day of reaping, if the master or mistress or a stranger enters the field, or merely passesby it, all the mowers face towards him and sharpen their scythes, clashing their whet-stonesagainst them in unison, as if they were making ready to mow. Then the woman who leads themowers steps up to him and ties a band round his left arm. He must ransom himself by pay-ment of a forfeit. Near Ratzeburg, when the master or other person of mark enters the field orpasses by it, all the harvesters stop work and march towards him in a body, the men withtheir scythes in front. On meeting him they form up in line, men and women. The men stickthe poles of their scythes in the ground, as they do in whetting them; then they take off theircaps and hang them on the scythes, while their leader stands forward and makes a speech.When he has done, they all whet their scythes in measured time very loudly, after which theyput on their caps. Two of the women binders then come forward; one of them ties the masteror stranger (as the case may be) with corn-ears or with a silken band; the other delivers arhyming address. The following are specimens of the speeches made by the reaper on theseoccasions. In some parts of Pomerania every passer-by is stopped, his way being barred witha corn-rope. The reapers form a circle round him and sharpen their scythes, while their leadersays: Page 333"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"“The men are ready, The scythes are bent, The corn is great and small, The gentleman must be mowed.”Then the process of whetting the scythes is repeated. At Ramin, in the district of Stettin, thestranger, standing encircled by the reapers, is thus addressed: “We’ll stroke the gentleman With our naked sword, Wherewith we shear meadows and fields. We shear princes and lords. Labourers are often athirst; If the gentleman will stand beer and brandy The joke will soon be over. But, if our prayer he does not like, The sword has a right to strike.”On the threshing-floor strangers are also regarded as embodiments of the corn-spirit, and aretreated accordingly. At Wiedingharde in Schleswig when a stranger comes to the threshing-floor he is asked, “Shall I teach you the flail-dance?” If he says yes, they put the arms of thethreshing-flail round his neck as if he were a sheaf of corn, and press them together so tightthat he is nearly choked. In some parishes of Wermland (Sweden), when a stranger entersthe threshing-floor where the threshers are at work, they say that “they will teach him thethreshing-song.” Then they put a flail round his neck and a straw rope about his body. Also,as we have seen, if a stranger woman enters the threshing-floor, the threshers put a flailround her body and a wreath of corn-stalks round her neck, and call out, “See the Corn-woman! See! that is how the Corn-maiden looks!”Thus in these harvest-customs of modern Europe the person who cuts, binds, or threshes thelast corn is treated as an embodiment of the corn-spirit by being wrapt up in sheaves, killed inmimicry by agricultural implements, and thrown into the water. These coincidences with theLityerses story seem to prove that the latter is a genuine description of an old Phrygian har-vest-custom. But since in the modern parallels the killing of the personal representative of thecorn-spirit is necessarily omitted or at most enacted only in mimicry, it is desirable to showthat in rude society human beings have been commonly killed as an agricultural ceremony topromote the fertility of the fields. The following examples will make this plain.3. HUMAN SACRIFICES FOR THE CROPSThe Indians of Guayaquil, in Ecuador, used to sacrifice human blood and the hearts of menwhen they sowed their fields. The people of Cañar (now Cuenca in Ecuador) used to sacrificea hundred children annually at harvest. The kings of Quito, the Incas of Peru, and for a longtime the Spaniards were unable to suppress the bloody rite. At a Mexican harvest-festival,when the first-fruits of the season were offered to the sun, a criminal was placed between twoimmense stones, balanced opposite each other, and was crushed by them as they fell togeth-er. His remains were buried, and a feast and dance followed. This sacrifice was known as“the meeting of the stones.” We have seen that the ancient Mexicans also sacrificed humanbeings at all the various stages in the growth of the maize, the age of the victims correspon-ding to the age of the corn; for they sacrificed new-born babes at sowing, older children whenPage 334"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"the grain had sprouted, and so on till it was fully ripe, when they sacrificed old men. No doubtthe correspondence between the ages of the victims and the state of the corn was supposedto enhance the efficacy of the sacrifice.The Pawnees annually sacrificed a human victim in spring when they sowed their fields. Thesacrifice was believed to have been enjoined on them by the Morning Star, or by a certainbird which the Morning Star had sent to them as its messenger. The bird was stuffed and pre-served as a powerful talisman. They thought that an omission of this sacrifice would be fol-lowed by the total failure of the crops of maize, beans, and pumpkins. The victim was a cap-tive of either sex. He was clad in the gayest and most costly attire, was fattened on the choic-est food, and carefully kept in ignorance of his doom. When he was fat enough, they boundhim to a cross in the presence of the multitude, danced a solemn dance, then cleft his headwith a tomahawk and shot him with arrows. According to one trader, the squaws then cutpieces of flesh from the victim’s body, with which they greased their hoes; but this was deniedby another trader who had been present at the ceremony. Immediately after the sacrifice thepeople proceeded to plant their fields. A particular account has been preserved of the sacri-fice of a Sioux girl by the Pawnees in April 1837 or 1838. The girl was fourteen or fifteenyears old and had been kept for six months and well treated. Two days before the sacrificeshe was led from wigwam to wigwam, accompanied by the whole council of chiefs and war-riors. At each lodge she received a small billet of wood and a little paint, which she handed tothe warrior next to her. In this way she called at every wigwam, receiving at each the samepresent of wood and paint. On the twenty-second of April she was taken out to be sacrificed,attended by the warriors, each of whom carried two pieces of wood which he had receivedfrom her hands. Her body having been painted half red and half black, she was attached to asort of gibbet and roasted for some time over a slow fire, then shot to death with arrows. Thechief sacrificer next tore out her heart and devoured it. While her flesh was still warm it wascut in small pieces from the bones, put in little baskets, and taken to a neighbouring corn-field. There the head chief took a piece of the flesh from a basket and squeezed a drop ofblood upon the newly-deposited grains of corn. His example was followed by the rest, till allthe seed had been sprinkled with the blood; it was then covered up with earth. According toone account the body of the victim was reduced to a kind of paste, which was rubbed orsprinkled not only on the maize but also on the potatoes, the beans, and other seeds to fer-tilise them. By this sacrifice they hoped to obtain plentiful crops.AWest African queen used to sacrifice a man and woman in the month of March. They werekilled with spades and hoes, and their bodies buried in the middle of a field which had justbeen tilled. At Lagos in Guinea it was the custom annually to impale a young girl alive soonafter the spring equinox in order to secure good crops. Along with her were sacrificed sheepand goats, which, with yams, heads of maize, and plantains, were hung on stakes on eachside of her. The victims were bred up for the purpose in the king’s seraglio, and their mindshad been so powerfully wrought upon by the fetish men that they went cheerfully to their fate.Asimilar sacrifice used to be annually offered at Benin, in Guinea. The Marimos, a Bechuanatribe, sacrifice a human being for the crops. The victim chosen is generally a short, stout man.He is seized by violence or intoxicated and taken to the fields, where he is killed amongst thewheat to serve as “seed” (so they phrase it). After his blood has coagulated in the sun, it isburned along with the frontal bone, the flesh attached to it, and the brain; the ashes are thenscattered over the ground to fertilise it. The rest of the body is eaten.The Bagobos of Mindanao, one of the Philippine Islands, offer a human sacrifice before theysow their rice. The victim is a slave, who is hewn to pieces in the forest. The natives ofPage 335"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Bontoc in the interior of Luzon, one of the Philippine Islands, are passionate head-hunters.Their principal seasons for head-hunting are the times of planting and reaping the rice. Inorder that the crop may turn out well, every farm must get at least one human head at plant-ing and one at sowing. The head-hunters go out in twos or threes, lie in wait for the victim,whether man or woman, cut off his or her head, hands, and feet, and bring them back inhaste to the village, where they are received with great rejoicings. The skulls are at firstexposed on the branches of two or three dead trees which stand in an open space of everyvillage surrounded by large stones which serve as seats. The people then dance round themand feast and get drunk. When the flesh has decayed from the head, the man who cut it offtakes it home and preserves it as a relic, while his companions do the same with the handsand the feet. Similar customs are observed by the Apoyaos, another tribe in the interior ofLuzon.Among the Lhota Naga, one of the many savage tribes who inhabit the deep ruggedlabyrinthine glens which wind into the mountains from the rich valley of Brahmapootra, it usedto be a common custom to chop off the heads, hands, and feet of people they met with, andthen to stick up the severed extremities in their fields to ensure a good crop of grain. Theybore no ill-will whatever to the persons upon whom they operated in this unceremonious fash-ion. Once they flayed a boy alive, carved him in pieces, and distributed the flesh among allthe villagers, who put it into their corn-bins to avert bad luck and ensure plentiful crops ofgrain. The Gonds of India, a Dravidian race, kidnapped Brahman boys, and kept them as vic-tims to be sacrificed on various occasions. At sowing and reaping, after a triumphal proces-sion, one of the lads was slain by being punctured with a poisoned arrow. His blood was thensprinkled over the ploughed field or the ripe crop, and his flesh was devoured. The Oraons orUraons of Chota Nagpur worship a goddess called Anna Kuari, who can give good crops andmake a man rich, but to induce her to do so it is necessary to offer human sacrifices. In spiteof the vigilance of the British Government these sacrifices are said to be still secretly perpe-trated. The victims are poor waifs and strays whose disappearance attracts no notice. Apriland May are the months when the catchpoles are out on the prowl. At that time strangers willnot go about the country alone, and parents will not let their children enter the jungle or herdthe cattle. When a catchpole has found a victim, he cuts his throat and carries away theupper part of the ring finger and the nose. The goddess takes up her abode in the house ofany man who has offered her a sacrifice, and from that time his fields yield a double harvest.The form she assumes in the house is that of a small child. When the householder brings inhis unhusked rice, he takes the goddess and rolls her over the heap to double its size. Butshe soon grows restless and can only be pacified with the blood of fresh human victims.But the best known case of human sacrifices, systematically offered to ensure good crops, issupplied by the Khonds or Kandhs, another Dravidian race in Bengal. Our knowledge of themis derived from the accounts written by British officers who, about the middle of the nineteenthcentury, were engaged in putting them down. The sacrifices were offered to the EarthGoddess. Tari Pennu or Bera Pennu, and were believed to ensure good crops and immunityfrom all disease and accidents. In particular, they were considered necessary in the cultiva-tion of turmeric, the Khonds arguing that the turmeric could not have a deep red colour with-out the shedding of blood. The victim or Meriah, as he was called, was acceptable to the god-dess only if he had been purchased, or had been born a victim—that is, the son of a victimfather, or had been devoted as a child by his father or guardian. Khonds in distress often soldtheir children for victims, “considering the beatification of their souls certain, and their death,for the benefit of mankind, the most honourable possible.” A man of the Panua tribe was onceseen to load a Khond with curses, and finally to spit in his face, because the Khond had soldPage 336"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"for a victim his own child, whom the Panua had wished to marry. A party of Khonds, who sawthis, immediately pressed forward to comfort the seller of his child, saying, “Your child hasdied that all the world may live, and the Earth Goddess herself will wipe that spittle from yourface.” The victims were often kept for years before they were sacrificed. Being regarded asconsecrated beings, they were treated with extreme affection, mingled with deference, andwere welcomed wherever they went. A Meriah youth, on attaining maturity, was generallygiven a wife, who was herself usually a Meriah or victim; and with her he received a portion ofland and farm-stock. Their offspring were also victims. Human sacrifices were offered to theEarth Goddess by tribes, branches of tribes, or villages, both at periodical festivals and onextraordinary occasions. The periodical sacrifices were generally so arranged by tribes anddivisions of tribes that each head of a family was enabled, at least once a year, to procure ashred of flesh for his fields, generally about the time when his chief crop was laid down.The mode of performing these tribal sacrifices was as follows. Ten or twelve days before thesacrifice, the victim was devoted by cutting off his hair, which, until then, had been keptunshorn. Crowds of men and women assembled to witness the sacrifice; none might beexcluded, since the sacrifice was declared to be for all mankind. It was preceded by severaldays of wild revelry and gross debauchery. On the day before the sacrifice the victim, dressedin a new garment, was led forth from the village in solemn procession, with music and danc-ing, to the Meriah grove, a clump of high forest trees standing a little way from the village anduntouched by the axe. There they tied him to a post, which was sometimes placed betweentwo plants of the sankissar shrub. He was then anointed with oil, ghee, and turmeric, andadorned with flowers; and “a species of reverence, which it is not easy to distinguish fromadoration,” was paid to him throughout the day. A great struggle now arose to obtain thesmallest relic from his person; a particle of the turmeric paste with which he was smeared, ora drop of his spittle, was esteemed of sovereign virtue, especially by the women. The crowddanced round the post to music, and addressing the earth, said, “O God, we offer this sacri-fice to you; give us good crops, seasons, and health”; then speaking to the victim they said,“We bought you with a price, and did not seize you; now we sacrifice you according to cus-tom, and no sin rests with us.”On the last morning the orgies, which had been scarcely interrupted during the night, wereresumed, and continued till noon, when they ceased, and the assembly proceeded to con-summate the sacrifice. The victim was again anointed with oil, and each person touched theanointed part, and wiped the oil on his own head. In some places they took the victim in pro-cession round the village, from door to door, where some plucked hair from his head, andothers begged for a drop of his spittle, with which they anointed their heads. As the victimmight not be bound nor make any show of resistance, the bones of his arms and, if neces-sary, his legs were broken; but often this precaution was rendered unnecessary by stupefyinghim with opium. The mode of putting him to death varied in different places. One of the com-monest modes seems to have been strangulation, or squeezing to death. The branch of agreen tree was cleft several feet down the middle; the victim’s neck (in other places, hischest) was inserted in the cleft, which the priest, aided by his assistants, strove with all hisforce to close. Then he wounded the victim slightly with his axe, whereupon the crowd rushedat the wretch and hewed the flesh from the bones, leaving the head and bowels untouched.Sometimes he was cut up alive. In Chinna Kimedy he was dragged along the fields, sur-rounded by the crowd, who, avoiding his head and intestines, hacked the flesh from his bodywith their knives till he died. Another very common mode of sacrifice in the same district wasto fasten the victim to the proboscis of a wooden elephant, which revolved on a stout post,and, as it whirled round, the crowd cut the flesh from the victim while life remained. In somePage 337"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"villages Major Campbell found as many as fourteen of these wooden elephants, which hadbeen used at sacrifices. In one district the victim was put to death slowly by fire. A low stagewas formed, sloping on either side like a roof; upon it they laid the victim, his limbs woundround with cords to confine his struggles. Fires were then lighted and hot brands applied, tomake him roll up and down the slopes of the stage as long as possible; for the more tears heshed the more abundant would be the supply of rain. Next day the body was cut to pieces.The flesh cut from the victim was instantly taken home by the persons who had been deputedby each village to bring it. To secure its rapid arrival, it was sometimes forwarded by relays ofmen, and conveyed with postal fleetness fifty or sixty miles. In each village all who stayed athome fasted rigidly until the flesh arrived. The bearer deposited it in the place of publicassembly, where it was received by the priest and the heads of families. The priest divided itinto two portions, one of which he offered to the Earth Goddess by burying it in a hole in theground with his back turned, and without looking. Then each man added a little earth to buryit, and the priest poured water on the spot from a hill gourd. The other portion of flesh hedivided into as many shares as there were heads of houses present. Each head of a houserolled his shred of flesh in leaves, and buried it in his favourite field, placing it in the earthbehind his back without looking. In some places each man carried his portion of flesh to thestream which watered his fields, and there hung it on a pole. For three days thereafter nohouse was swept; and, in one district, strict silence was observed, no fire might be given out,no wood cut, and no strangers received. The remains of the human victim (namely, the head,bowels, and bones) were watched by strong parties the night after the sacrifice; and nextmorning they were burned, along with a whole sheep, on a funeral pile. The ashes were scat-tered over the fields, laid as paste over the houses and granaries, or mixed with the new cornto preserve it from insects. Sometimes, however, the head and bones were buried, not burnt.After the suppression of the human sacrifices, inferior victims were substituted in someplaces; for instance, in the capital of Chinna Kimedy a goat took the place of the human vic-tim. Others sacrifice a buffalo. They tie it to a wooden post in a sacred grove, dance wildlyround it with brandished knives, then, falling on the living animal, hack it to shreds and tattersin a few minutes, fighting and struggling with each other for every particle of flesh. As soon asa man has secured a piece he makes off with it at full speed to bury it in his fields, accordingto ancient custom, before the sun has set, and as some of them have far to go they must runvery fast. All the women throw clods of earth at the rapidly retreating figures of the men, someof them taking very good aim. Soon the sacred grove, so lately a scene of tumult, is silentand deserted except for a few people who remain to guard all that is left of the buffalo, to wit,the head, the bones, and the stomach, which are burned with ceremony at the foot of thestake.In these Khond sacrifices the Meriahs are represented by our authorities as victims offered topropitiate the Earth Goddess. But from the treatment of the victims both before and afterdeath it appears that the custom cannot be explained as merely a propitiatory sacrifice. A partof the flesh certainly was offered to the Earth Goddess, but the rest was buried by eachhouseholder in his fields, and the ashes of the other parts of the body were scattered over thefields, laid as paste on the granaries, or mixed with the new corn. These latter customs implythat to the body of the Meriah there was ascribed a direct or intrinsic power of making thecrops to grow, quite independent of the indirect efficacy which it might have as an offering tosecure the good-will of the deity. In other words, the flesh and ashes of the victim werebelieved to be endowed with a magical or physical power of fertilising the land. The sameintrinsic power was ascribed to the blood and tears of the Meriah, his blood causing the red-ness of the turmeric and his tears producing rain; for it can hardly be doubted that, originallyPage 338"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"at least, the tears were supposed to bring down the rain, not merely to prognosticate it.Similarly the custom of pouring water on the buried flesh of the Meriah was no doubt a rain-charm. Again, magical power as an attribute of the Meriah appears in the sovereign virtuebelieved to reside in anything that came from his person, as his hair or spittle. The ascriptionof such power to the Meriah indicates that he was much more than a mere man sacrificed topropitiate a deity. Once more, the extreme reverence paid him points to the same conclusion.Major Campbell speaks of the Meriah as “being regarded as something more than mortal,”and Major Macpherson says, “A species of reverence, which it is not easy to distinguish fromadoration, is paid to him.” In short, the Meriah seems to have been regarded as divine. Assuch, he may originally have represented the Earth Goddess or, perhaps, a deity of vegeta-tion; though in later times he came to be regarded rather as a victim offered to a deity than ashimself an incarnate god. This later view of the Meriah as a victim rather than a divinity mayperhaps have received undue emphasis from the European writers who have described theKhond religion. Habituated to the later idea of sacrifice as an offering made to a god for thepurpose of conciliating his favour, European observers are apt to interpret all religious slaugh-ter in this sense, and to suppose that wherever such slaughter takes place, there must neces-sarily be a deity to whom the carnage is believed by the slayers to be acceptable. Thus theirpreconceived ideas may unconsciously colour and warp their descriptions of savage rites.The same custom of killing the representative of a god, of which strong traces appear in theKhond sacrifices, may perhaps be detected in some of the other human sacrifices describedabove. Thus the ashes of the slaughtered Marimo were scattered over the fields; the blood ofthe Brahman lad was put on the crop and field; the flesh of the slain Naga was stowed in thecorn-bin; and the blood of the Sioux girl was allowed to trickle on the seed. Again, the identifi-cation of the victim with the corn, in other words, the view that he is an embodiment or spiritof the corn, is brought out in the pains which seem to be taken to secure a physical corre-spondence between him and the natural object which he embodies or represents. Thus theMexicans killed young victims for the young corn and old ones for the ripe corn; the Marimossacrifice, as “seed,” a short, fat man, the shortness of his stature corresponding to that of theyoung corn, his fatness to the condition which it is desired that the crops may attain; and thePawnees fattened their victims probably with the same view. Again, the identification of thevictim with the corn comes out in the African custom of killing him with spades and hoes, andthe Mexican custom of grinding him, like corn, between two stones.One more point in these savage customs deserves to be noted. The Pawnee chief devouredthe heart of the Sioux girl, and the Marimos and Gonds ate the victim’s flesh. If, as we sup-pose, the victim was regarded as divine, it follows that in eating his flesh his worshippersbelieved themselves to be partaking of the body of their god.4. THE CORN-SPIRIT SLAIN IN HIS HUMAN REPRESENTATIVESThe barbarous rites just described offer analogies to the harvest customs of Europe. Thus thefertilising virtue ascribed to the corn-spirit is shown equally in the savage custom of mixingthe victim’s blood or ashes with the seed-corn and the European custom of mixing the grainfrom the last sheaf with the young corn in spring. Again, the identification of the person withthe corn appears alike in the savage custom of adapting the age and stature of the victim tothe age and stature, whether actual or expected, of the crop; in the Scotch and Styrian rulesthat when the corn-spirit is conceived as the Maiden the last corn shall be cut by a youngmaiden, but when it is conceived as the Corn-mother it shall be cut by an old woman; in thewarning given to old women in Lorraine to save themselves when the Old Woman is beingPage 339"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"killed, that is, when the last corn is being threshed; and in the Tyrolese expectation that if theman who gives the last stroke at threshing is tall, the next year’s corn will be tall also. Further,the same identification is implied in the savage custom of killing the representative of thecorn-spirit with hoes or spades or by grinding him between stones, and in the European cus-tom of pretending to kill him with the scythe or the flail. Once more the Khond custom of pour-ing water on the buried flesh of the victim is parallel to the European customs of pouringwater on the personal representative of the corn-spirit or plunging him into a stream. Both theKhond and the European customs are rain-charms.To return now to the Lityerses story. It has been shown that in rude society human beingshave been commonly killed to promote the growth of the crops. There is therefore no improb-ability in the supposition that they may once have been killed for a like purpose in Phrygiaand Europe; and when Phrygian legend and European folk-custom, closely agreeing witheach other, point to the conclusion that men were so slain, we are bound, provisionally atleast, to accept the conclusion. Further, both the Lityerses story and European harvest-cus-toms agree in indicating that the victim was put to death as a representative of the corn-spirit,and this indication is in harmony with the view which some savages appear to take of the vic-tim slain to make the crops flourish. On the whole, then, we may fairly suppose that both inPhrygia and in Europe the representative of the corn-spirit was annually killed upon the har-vest-field. Grounds have been already shown for believing that similarly in Europe the repre-sentative of the tree-spirit was annually slain. The proofs of these two remarkable and closelyanalogous customs are entirely independent of each other. Their coincidence seems to fur-nish fresh presumption in favour of both.To the question, How was the representative of the corn-spirit chosen? one answer has beenalready given. Both the Lityerses story and European folk-custom show that passingstrangers were regarded as manifestations of the corn-spirit escaping from the cut orthreshed corn, and as such were seized and slain. But this is not the only answer which theevidence suggests. According to the Phrygian legend the victims of Lityerses were not simplypassing strangers, but persons whom he had vanquished in a reaping contest and afterwardswrapt up in corn-sheaves and beheaded. This suggests that the representative of the corn-spirit may have been selected by means of a competition on the harvest-field, in which thevanquished competitor was compelled to accept the fatal honour. The supposition is counte-nanced by European harvest-customs. We have seen that in Europe there is sometimes acontest amongst the reapers to avoid being last, and that the person who is vanquished inthis competition, that is, who cuts the last corn, is often roughly handled. It is true we havenot found that a pretence is made of killing him; but on the other hand we have found that apretence is made of killing the man who gives the last stroke at threshing, that is, who is van-quished in the threshing contest. Now, since it is in the character of representative of thecorn-spirit that the thresher of the last corn is slain in mimicry, and since the same represen-tative character attaches (as we have seen) to the cutter and binder as well as to the thresherof the last corn, and since the same repugnance is evinced by harvesters to be last in anyone of these labours, we may conjecture that a pretence has been commonly made of killingthe reaper and binder as well as the thresher of the last corn, and that in ancient times thiskilling was actually carried out. This conjecture is corroborated by the common superstitionthat whoever cuts the last corn must die soon. Sometimes it is thought that the person whobinds the last sheaf on the field will die in the course of next year. The reason for fixing on thereaper, binder, or thresher of the last corn as the representative of the corn-spirit may be this.The corn-spirit is supposed to lurk as long as he can in the corn, retreating before thereapers, the binders, and the threshers at their work. But when he is forcibly expelled from hisPage 340"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"refuge in the last corn cut or the last sheaf bound or the last grain threshed, he necessarilyassumes some other form than that of the corn-stalks, which had hitherto been his garmentor body. And what form can the expelled corn-spirit assume more naturally than that of theperson who stands nearest to the corn from which he (the corn-spirit) has just been expelled?But the person in question is necessarily the reaper, binder, or thresher of the last corn. He orshe, therefore, is seized and treated as the corn-spirit himself.Thus the person who was killed on the harvest-field as the representative of the corn-spiritmay have been either a passing stranger or the harvester who was last at reaping, binding, orthreshing. But there is a third possibility, to which ancient legend and modern folk-customalike point. Lityerses not only put strangers to death; he was himself slain, and apparently inthe same way as he had slain others, namely, by being wrapt in a corn-sheaf, beheaded, andcast into the river; and it is implied that this happened to Lityerses on his own land. Similarlyin modern harvest-customs the pretence of killing appears to be carried out quite as often onthe person of the master (farmer or squire) as on that of strangers. Now when we rememberthat Lityerses was said to have been a son of the King of Phrygia, and that in one account heis himself called a king, and when we combine with this the tradition that he was put to death,apparently as a representative of the corn-spirit, we are led to conjecture that we have hereanother trace of the custom of annually slaying one of those divine or priestly kings who areknown to have held ghostly sway in many parts of Western Asia and particularly in Phrygia.The custom appears, as we have seen, to have been so far modified in places that the king’sson was slain in the king’s stead. Of the custom thus modified the story of Lityerses would be,in one version at least, a reminiscence.Turning now to the relation of the Phrygian Lityerses to the Phrygian Attis, it may be remem-bered that at Pessinus—the seat of a priestly kingship—the high-priest appears to have beenannually slain in the character of Attis, a god of vegetation, and that Attis was described by anancient authority as “a reaped ear of corn.” Thus Attis, as an embodiment of the corn-spirit,annually slain in the person of his representative, might be thought to be ultimately identicalwith Lityerses, the latter being simply the rustic prototype out of which the state religion ofAttis was developed. It may have been so; but, on the other hand, the analogy of Europeanfolk-custom warns us that amongst the same people two distinct deities of vegetation mayhave their separate personal representatives, both of whom are slain in the character of godsat different times of the year. For in Europe, as we have seen, it appears that one man wascommonly slain in the character of the tree-spirit in spring, and another in the character of thecorn-spirit in autumn. It may have been so in Phrygia also. Attis was especially a tree-god,and his connexion with corn may have been only such an extension of the power of a tree-spirit as is indicated in customs like the Harvest-May. Again, the representative of Attisappears to have been slain in spring; whereas Lityerses must have been slain in summer orautumn, according to the time of the harvest in Phrygia. On the whole, then, while we are notjustified in regarding Lityerses as the prototype of Attis, the two may be regarded as parallelproducts of the same religious idea, and may have stood to each other as in Europe the OldMan of harvest stands to the Wild Man, the Leaf Man, and so forth, of spring. Both were spir-its or deities of vegetation, and the personal representatives of both were annually slain. Butwhereas the Attis worship became elevated into the dignity of a state religion and spread toItaly, the rites of Lityerses seem never to have passed the limits of their native Phrygia, andalways retained their character of rustic ceremonies performed by peasants on the harvest-field. At most a few villages may have clubbed together, as amongst the Khonds, to procure ahuman victim to be slain as representative of the corn-spirit for their common benefit. Suchvictims may have been drawn from the families of priestly kings or kinglets, which wouldPage 341"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"account for the legendary character of Lityerses as the son of a Phrygian king or as himself aking. When villages did not so club together, each village or farm may have procured its ownrepresentative of the corn-spirit by dooming to death either a passing stranger or the har-vester who cut, bound, or threshed the last sheaf. Perhaps in the olden time the practice ofhead-hunting as a means of promoting the growth of the corn may have been as commonamong the rude inhabitants of Europe and Western Asia as it still is, or was till lately, amongthe primitive agricultural tribes of Assam, Burma, the Philippine Islands, and the IndianArchipelago. It is hardly necessary to add that in Phrygia, as in Europe, the old barbarouscustom of killing a man on the harvest-field or the threshing-floor had doubtless passed into amere pretence long before the classical era, and was probably regarded by the reapers andthreshers themselves as no more than a rough jest which the license of a harvest-home per-mitted them to play off on a passing stranger, a comrade, or even on their master himself.I have dwelt on the Lityerses song at length because it affords so many points of comparisonwith European and savage folk-custom. The other harvest songs of Western Asia and Egypt,to which attention has been called above, may now be dismissed much more briefly. The sim-ilarity of the Bithynian Bormus to the Phrygian Lityerses helps to bear out the interpretationwhich has been given of the latter. Bormus, whose death or rather disappearance was annu-ally mourned by the reapers in a plaintive song, was, like Lityerses, a king’s son or at leastthe son of a wealthy and distinguished man. The reapers whom he watched were at work onhis own fields, and he disappeared in going to fetch water for them; according to one versionof the story he was carried off by the nymphs, doubtless the nymphs of the spring or pool orriver whither he went to draw water. Viewed in the light of the Lityerses story and of Europeanfolk-custom, this disappearance of Bormus may be a reminiscence of the custom of bindingthe farmer himself in a corn-sheaf and throwing him into the water. The mournful strain whichthe reapers sang was probably a lamentation over the death of the corn-spirit, slain either inthe cut corn or in the person of a human representative; and the call which they addressed tohim may have been a prayer that he might return in fresh vigour next year.The Phoenician Linus song was sung at the vintage, at least in the west of Asia Minor, as welearn from Homer; and this, combined with the legend of Syleus, suggests that in ancienttimes passing strangers were handled by vintagers and vine-diggers in much the same wayas they are said to have been handled by the reaper Lityerses. The Lydian Syleus, so ran thelegend, compelled passers-by to dig for him in his vineyard, till Hercules came and killed himand dug up his vines by the roots. This seems to be the outline of a legend like that ofLityerses; but neither ancient writers nor modern folk-custom enable us to fill in the details.But, further, the Linus song was probably sung also by Phoenician reapers, for Herodotuscompares it to the Maneros song, which, as we have seen, was a lament raised by Egyptianreapers over the cut corn. Further, Linus was identified with Adonis, and Adonis has someclaims to be regarded as especially a corn-deity. Thus the Linus lament, as sung at harvest,would be identical with the Adonis lament; each would be the lamentation raised by reapersover the dead spirit of the corn. But whereas Adonis, like Attis, grew into a stately figure ofmythology, adored and mourned in splendid cities far beyond the limits of his Phoenicianhome, Linus appears to have remained a simple ditty sung by reapers and vintagers amongthe corn-sheaves and the vines. The analogy of Lityerses and of folk-custom, both Europeanand savage, suggests that in Phoenicia the slain corn-spirit—the dead Adonis—may formerlyhave been represented by a human victim; and this suggestion is possibly supported by theHarran legend that Tammuz (Adonis) was slain by his cruel lord, who ground his bones in amill and scattered them to the wind. For in Mexico, as we have seen, the human victim atharvest was crushed between two stones; and both in Africa and India the ashes or otherPage 342"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"remains of the victim were scattered over the fields. But the Harran legend may be only amythical way of expressing the grinding of corn in the mill and the scattering of the seed. Itseems worth suggesting that the mock king who was annually killed at the Babylonian festivalof the Sacaea on the sixteenth day of the month Lous may have represented Tammuz him-self. For the historian Berosus, who records the festival and its date, probably used theMacedonian calendar, since he dedicated his history to Antiochus Soter; and in his day theMacedonian month Lous appears to have corresponded to the Babylonian month Tammuz. Ifthis conjecture is right, the view that the mock king at the Sacaea was slain in the characterof a god would be established.There is a good deal more evidence that in Egypt the slain corn-spirit—the dead Osiris—wasrepresented by a human victim, whom the reapers slew on the harvest-field, mourning hisdeath in a dirge, to which the Greeks, through a verbal misunderstanding, gave the name ofManeros. For the legend of Busiris seems to preserve a reminiscence of human sacrificesonce offered by the Egyptians in connexion with the worship of Osiris. Busiris was said tohave been an Egyptian king who sacrificed all strangers on the altar of Zeus. The origin of thecustom was traced to a dearth which afflicted the land of Egypt for nine years. A Cyprian seerinformed Busiris that the dearth would cease if a man were annually sacrificed to Zeus. SoBusiris instituted the sacrifice. But when Hercules came to Egypt, and was being dragged tothe altar to be sacrificed, he burst his bonds and slew Busiris and his son. Here then is a leg-end that in Egypt a human victim was annually sacrificed to prevent the failure of the crops,and a belief is implied that an omission of the sacrifice would have entailed a recurrence ofthat infertility which it was the object of the sacrifice to prevent. So the Pawnees, as we haveseen, believed that an omission of the human sacrifice at planting would have been followedby a total failure of their crops. The name Busiris was in reality the name of a city, pe-Asar,“the house of Osiris,” the city being so called because it contained the grave of Osiris. Indeedsome high modern authorities believe that Busiris was the original home of Osiris, from whichhis worship spread to other parts of Egypt. The human sacrifice were said to have beenoffered at his grave, and the victims were red-haired men, whose ashes were scatteredabroad by means of winnowing-fans. This tradition of human sacrifices offered at the tomb ofOsiris is confirmed by the evidence of the monuments.In the light of the foregoing discussion the Egyptian tradition of Busiris admits of a consistentand fairly probable explanation. Osiris, the corn-spirit, was annually represented at harvest bya stranger, whose red hair made him a suitable representative of the ripe corn. This man, inhis representative character, was slain on the harvest-field, and mourned by the reapers, whoprayed at the same time that the corn-spirit might revive and return (mââ-ne-rha, Maneros)with renewed vigour in the following year. Finally, the victim, or some part of him, was burned,and the ashes scattered by winnowing-fans over the fields to fertilise them. Here the choice ofthe victim on the ground of his resemblance to the corn which he was to represent agreeswith the Mexican and African customs already described. Similarly the woman who died in thecharacter of the Corn-mother at the Mexican midsummer sacrifice had her face painted redand yellow in token of the colours of the corn, and she wore a pasteboard mitre surmountedby waving plumes in imitation of the tassel of the maize. On the other hand, at the festival ofthe Goddess of the White Maize the Mexicans sacrificed lepers. The Romans sacrificed red-haired puppies in spring to avert the supposed blighting influence of the Dog-star, believingthat the crops would thus grow ripe and ruddy. The heathen of Harran offered to the sun,moon, and planets human victims who were chosen on the ground of their supposed resem-blance to the heavenly bodies to which they were sacrificed; for example, the priests, clothedin red and smeared with blood, offered a red-haired, red-cheeked man to “the red planetPage 343"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Mars” in a temple which was painted red and draped with red hangings. These and the likecases of assimilating the victim to the god, or to the natural phenomenon which he repre-sents, are based ultimately on the principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic, the notionbeing that the object aimed at will be most readily attained by means of a sacrifice whichresembles the effect that it is designed to bring about.The story that the fragments of Osiris’s body were scattered up and down the land, andburied by Isis on the spots where they lay, may very well be a reminiscence of a custom, likethat observed by the Khonds, of dividing the human victim in pieces and burying the pieces,often at intervals of many miles from each other, in the fields.Thus, if I am right, the key to the mysteries of Osiris is furnished by the melancholy cry of theEgyptian reapers, which down to Roman times could be heard year after year soundingacross the fields, announcing the death of the corn-spirit, the rustic prototype of Osiris.Similar cries, as we have seen, were also heard on all the harvest-fields of Western Asia. Bythe ancients they are spoken of as songs; but to judge from the analysis of the names Linusand Maneros, they probably consisted only of a few words uttered in a prolonged musicalnote which could be heard at a great distance. Such sonorous and long-drawn cries, raisedby a number of strong voices in concert, must have had a striking effect, and could hardly failto arrest the attention of any wayfarer who happened to be within hearing. The sounds,repeated again and again, could probably be distinguished with tolerable ease even at a dis-tance; but to a Greek traveller in Asia or Egypt the foreign words would commonly convey nomeaning, and he might take them, not unnaturally, for the name of some one (Maneros,Linus, Lityerses, Bormus) upon whom the reapers were calling. And if his journey led himthrough more countries than one, as Bithynia and Phrygia, or Phoenicia and Egypt, while thecorn was being reaped, he would have an opportunity of comparing the various harvest criesof the different peoples. Thus we can readily understand why these harvest cries were sooften noted and compared with each other by the Greeks. Whereas, if they had been regularsongs, they could not have been heard at such distances, and therefore could not haveattracted the attention of so many travellers; and, moreover, even if the wayfarer were withinhearing of them, he could not so easily have picked out the words.Down to recent times Devonshire reapers uttered cries of the same sort, and performed onthe field a ceremony exactly analogous to that in which, if I am not mistaken, the rites ofOsiris originated. The cry and the ceremony are thus described by an observer who wrote inthe first half of the nineteenth century. “After the wheat is all cut, on most farms in the north ofDevon, the harvest people have a custom of ‘crying the neck.’ I believe that this practice isseldom omitted on any large farm in that part of the country. It is done in this way. An oldman, or some one else well acquainted with the ceremonies used on the occasion (when thelabourers are reaping the last field of wheat), goes round to the shocks and sheaves, andpicks out a little bundle of all the best ears he can find; this bundle he ties up very neat andtrim, and plats and arranges the straws very tastefully. This is called ‘the neck’ of wheat, orwheaten-ears. After the field is cut out, and the pitcher once more circulated, the reapers,binders, and the women stand round in a circle. The person with ‘the neck’ stands in the cen-tre, grasping it with both hands. He first stoops and holds it near the ground, and all the menforming the ring take off their hats, stooping and holding them with both hands towards theground. They then all begin at once in a very prolonged and harmonious tone to cry ‘Theneck!’ at the same time slowly raising themselves upright, and elevating their arms and hatsabove their heads; the person with ‘the neck’ also raising it on high. This is done three times.They then change their cry to ‘Wee yen!’—’Way yen!’—which they sound in the same pro-Page 344"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"longed and slow manner as before, with singular harmony and effect, three times. This lastcry is accompanied by the same movements of the body and arms as in crying ‘the neck.’...After having thus repeated ‘the neck’ three times, and ‘wee yen,’ or ‘way yen’ as often, theyall burst out into a kind of loud and joyous laugh, flinging up their hats and caps into the air,capering about and perhaps kissing the girls. One of them then gets ‘the neck’ and runs ashard as he can down to the farmhouse, where the dairymaid, or one of the young femaledomestics, stands at the door prepared with a pail of water. If he who holds ‘the neck’ canmanage to get into the house, in any way unseen, or openly, by any other way than the doorat which the girl stands with the pail of water, then he may lawfully kiss her; but, if otherwise,he is regularly soused with the contents of the bucket. On a fine still autumn evening the ‘cry-ing of the neck’ has a wonderful effect at a distance, far finer than that of the Turkishmuezzin, which Lord Byron eulogises so much, and which he says is preferable to all thebells of Christendom. I have once or twice heard upwards of twenty men cry it, and some-times joined by an equal number of female voices. About three years back, on some highgrounds, where our people were harvesting, I heard six or seven ‘necks’ cried in one night,although I know that some of them were four miles off. They are heard through the quietevening air at a considerable distance sometimes.” Again, Mrs. Bray tells how, travelling inDevonshire, “she saw a party of reapers standing in a circle on a rising ground, holding theirsickles aloft. One in the middle held up some ears of corn tied together with flowers, and theparty shouted three times (what she writes as) ‘Arnack, arnack, arnack, we haven, we haven,we haven.’ They went home, accompanied by women and children carrying boughs of flow-ers, shouting and singing. The manservant who attended Mrs. Bray said ‘it was only the peo-ple making their games, as they always did, to the spirit of harvest.’” Here, as Miss Burneremarks, “‘arnack, we haven!’ is obviously in the Devon dialect, ‘a neck (or nack)! we haveun!’”Another account of this old custom, written at Truro in 1839, runs thus: “Now, when all thecorn was cut at Heligan, the farming men and maidens come in front of the house, and bringwith them a small sheaf of corn, the last that has been cut, and this is adorned with ribbonsand flowers, and one part is tied quite tight, so as to look like a neck. Then they cry out ‘Our(my) side, my side,’ as loud as they can; then the dairymaid gives the neck to the head farm-ing-man. He takes it, and says, very loudly three times, ‘I have him, I have him, I have him.’Then another farming-man shouts very loudly, ‘What have ye? what have ye? what have ye?’Then the first says, ‘A neck, a neck, a neck.’ And when he has said this, all the people makea very great shouting. This they do three times, and after one famous shout go away and eatsupper, and dance, and sing songs.” According to another account, “all went out to the fieldwhen the last corn was cut, the ‘neck’ was tied with ribbons and plaited, and they dancedround it, and carried it to the great kitchen, where by-and-by the supper was. The words wereas given in the previous account, and ‘Hip, hip, hack, heck, I have ‘ee, I have ‘ee, I have ‘ee.’It was hung up in the hall.” Another account relates that one of the men rushed from the fieldwith the last sheaf, while the rest pursued him with vessels of water, which they tried to throwover the sheaf before it could be brought into the barn.In the foregoing customs a particular bunch of ears, generally the last left standing, is con-ceived as the neck of the corn-spirit, who is consequently beheaded when the bunch is cutdown. Similarly in Shropshire the name “neck,” or “the gander’s neck,” used to be commonlygiven to the last handful of ears left standing in the middle of the field when all the rest of thecorn was cut. It was plaited together, and the reapers, standing ten or twenty paces off, threwtheir sickles at it. Whoever cut it through was said to have cut off the gander’s neck. The“neck” was taken to the farmer’s wife, who was supposed to keep it in the house for goodPage 345"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"luck till the next harvest came round. Near Trèves, the man who reaps the last standing corn“cuts the goat’s neck off.” At Faslane, on the Gareloch (Dumbartonshire), the last handful ofstanding corn was sometimes called the “head.” At Aurich, in East Friesland, the man whoreaps the last corn “cuts the hare’s tail off.” In mowing down the last corner of a field Frenchreapers sometimes call out, “We have the cat by the tail.” In Bresse (Bourgogne) the lastsheaf represented the fox. Beside it a score of ears were left standing to form the tail, andeach reaper, going back some paces, threw his sickle at it. He who succeeded in severing it“cut off the fox’s tail,” and a cry of “You cou cou!” was raised in his honour. These examplesleave no room to doubt the meaning of the Devonshire and Cornish expression “the neck,” asapplied to the last sheaf. The corn-spirit is conceived in human or animal form, and the laststanding corn is part of its body—its neck, its head, or its tail. Sometimes, as we have seen,the last corn is regarded as the navel-string. Lastly, the Devonshire custom of drenching withwater the person who brings in “the neck” is a raincharm, such as we have had many exam-ples of. Its parallel in the mysteries of Osiris was the custom of pouring water on the image ofOsiris or on the person who represented him.Chapter XLVIIIThe Corn-Spirit as an Animal1. ANIMAL EMBODIMENTS OF THE CORN-SPIRITIN some of the examples which I have cited to establish the meaning of the term “neck” asapplied to the last sheaf, the corn-spirit appears in animal form as a gander, a goat, a hare, acat, and a fox. This introduces us to a new aspect of the corn-spirit, which we must nowexamine. By doing so we shall not only have fresh examples of killing the god, but may hopealso to clear up some points which remain obscure in the myths and worship of Adonis, Attis,Osiris, Dionysus, Demeter, and Virbius.Amongst the many animals whose forms the corn-spirit is supposed to take are the wolf, dog,hare, fox, cock, goose, quail, cat, goat, cow (ox, bull), pig, and horse. In one or other of theseshapes the corn-spirit is often believed to be present in the corn, and to be caught or killed inthe last sheaf. As the corn is being cut the animal flees before the reapers, and if a reaper istaken ill on the field, he is supposed to have stumbled unwittingly on the corn-spirit, who hasthus punished the profane intruder. It is said “the Rye-wolf has got hold of him,” “the Harvest-goat has given him a push.” The person who cuts the last corn or binds the last sheaf getsthe name of the animal, as the Rye-wolf, the Rye-sow, the Oats-goat, and so forth, andretains the name sometimes for a year. Also the animal is frequently represented by a puppetmade out of the last sheaf or of wood, flowers, and so on, which is carried home amid rejoic-ings on the last harvest-waggon. Even where the last sheaf is not made up in animal shape, itis often called the Rye-wolf, the Hare, Goat, and so forth. Generally each kind of crop is sup-posed to have its special animal, which is caught in the last sheaf, and called the Rye-wolf,the Barley-wolf, the Oats-wolf, the Pea-wolf, or the Potato-wolf, according to the crop; butsometimes the figure of the animal is only made up once for all at getting in the last crop ofthe whole harvest. Sometimes the creature is believed to be killed by the last stroke of thesickle or scythe. But oftener it is thought to live so long as there is corn still unthreshed, andto be caught in the last sheaf threshed. Hence the man who gives the last stroke with the flailis told that he has got the Corn-sow, the Threshing-dog, or the like. When the threshing is fin-ished, a puppet is made in the form of the animal, and this is carried by the thresher of thelast sheaf to a neighbouring farm, where the threshing is still going on. This again shows thatthe corn-spirit is believed to live wherever the corn is still being threshed. Sometimes thePage 346"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"thresher of the last sheaf himself represents the animal; and if the people of the next farm,who are still threshing, catch him, they treat him like the animal he represents, by shuttinghim up in the pig-sty, calling him with the cries commonly addressed to pigs, and so forth.These general statements will now be illustrated by examples.2. THE CORN-SPIRIT AS A WOLF OR A DOGWe begin with the corn-spirit conceived as a wolf or a dog. This conception is common inFrance, Germany, and Slavonic countries. Thus, when the wind sets the corn in wave-likemotion the peasants often say, “The Wolf is going over, or through, the corn,” “the Rye-wolf isrushing over the field,” “the Wolf is in the corn,” “the mad Dog is in the corn,” “the big Dog isthere.” When children wish to go into the corn-fields to pluck ears or gather the blue corn-flowers, they are warned not to do so, for “the big Dog sits in the corn,” or “the Wolf sits in thecorn, and will tear you in pieces,” “the Wolf will eat you.” The wolf against whom the childrenare warned is not a common wolf, for he is often spoken of as the Corn-wolf, Rye-wolf, or thelike; thus they say, “The Rye-wolf will come and eat you up, children,” “the Rye-wolf will carryyou off,” and so forth. Still he has all the outward appearance of a wolf. For in the neighbour-hood of Feilenhof (East Prussia), when a wolf was seen running through a field, the peasantsused to watch whether he carried his tail in the air or dragged it on the ground. If he draggedit on the ground, they went after him, and thanked him for bringing them a blessing, and evenset tit-bits before him. But if he carried his tail high, they cursed him and tried to kill him. Herethe wolf is the corn-spirit whose fertilising power is in his tail.Both dog and wolf appear as embodiments of the corn-spirit in harvest-customs. Thus insome parts of Silesia the person who cuts or binds the last sheaf is called the Wheat-dog orthe Peas-pug. But it is in the harvest-customs of the north-east of France that the idea of theCorn-dog comes out most clearly. Thus when a harvester, through sickness, weariness, orlaziness, cannot or will not keep up with the reaper in front of him, they say, “The White Dogpassed near him,” “he has the White Bitch,” or “the White Bitch has bitten him. In the Vosgesthe Harvest-May is called the “Dog of the harvest,” and the person who cuts the last handfulof hay or wheat is said to “kill the Dog.” About Lons-le-Saulnier, in the Jura, the last sheaf iscalled the Bitch. In the neighbourhood of Verdun the regular expression for finishing the reap-ing is, “They are going to kill the Dog”; and at Epinal they say, according to the crop, “We willkill the Wheat-dog, or the Rye-dog, or the Potato-dog.” In Lorraine it is said of the man whocuts the last corn, “He is killing the Dog of the harvest.” At Dux, in the Tyrol, the man whogives the last stroke at threshing is said to “strike down the Dog”; and at Ahnebergen, nearStade, he is called, according to the crop, Corn-pug, Rye-pug, Wheat-pug.So with the wolf. In Silesia, when the reapers gather round the last patch of standing corn toreap it they are said to be about “to catch the Wolf.” In various parts of Mecklenburg, wherethe belief in the Corn-wolf is particularly prevalent, every one fears to cut the last corn,because they say that the Wolf is sitting in it; hence every reaper exerts himself to the utmostin order not to be the last, and every woman similarly fears to bind the last sheaf because“the Wolf is in it.” So both among the reapers and the binders there is a competition not to bethe last to finish. And in Germany generally it appears to be a common saying that “the Wolfsits in the last sheaf.” In some places they call out to the reaper, “Beware of the Wolf”; or theysay, “He is chasing the Wolf out of the corn.” In Mecklenburg the last bunch of standing cornis itself commonly called the Wolf, and the man who reaps it “has the Wolf,” the animal beingdescribed as the Rye-wolf, the Wheat-wolf, the Barley-wolf, and so on according to the partic-ular crop. The reaper of the last corn is himself called Wolf or the Rye-wolf, if the crop is rye,Page 347"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"and in many parts of Mecklenburg he has to support the character by pretending to bite theother harvesters or by howling like a wolf. The last sheaf of corn is also called the Wolf or theRye-wolf or the Oats-wolf according to the crop, and of the woman who binds it they say,“The Wolf is biting her,” “She has the Wolf,” “She must fetch the Wolf” (out of the corn).Moreover, she herself is called Wolf; they cry out to her, “Thou art the Wolf,” and she has tobear the name for a whole year; sometimes, according to the crop, she is called the Rye-wolfor the Potato-wolf. In the island of Rügen not only is the woman who binds the last sheafcalled Wolf, but when she comes home she bites the lady of the house and the stewardess,for which she receives a large piece of meat. Yet nobody likes to be the Wolf. The samewoman may be Rye-wolf, Wheat-wolf, and Oats-wolf, if she happens to bind the last sheaf ofrye, wheat, and oats. At Buir, in the district of Cologne, it was formerly the custom to give tothe last sheaf the shape of a wolf. It was kept in the barn till all the corn was threshed. Then itwas brought to the farmer and he had to sprinkle it with beer or brandy. At Brunshaupten inMecklenburg the young woman who bound the last sheaf of wheat used to take a handful ofstalks out of it and make “the Wheat-wolf” with them; it was the figure of a wolf about two feetlong and half a foot high, the legs of the animal being represented by stiff stalks and its tailand mane by wheat-ears. This Wheat-wolf she carried back at the head of the harvesters tothe village, where it was set up on a high place in the parlour of the farm and remained therefor a long time. In many places the sheaf called the Wolf is made up in human form anddressed in clothes. This indicates a confusion of ideas between the corn-spirit conceived inhuman and in animal form. Generally the Wolf is brought home on the last waggon with joyfulcries. Hence the last waggon-load itself receives the name of the Wolf.Again, the Wolf is supposed to hide himself amongst the cut corn in the granary, until he isdriven out of the last bundle by the strokes of the flail. Hence at Wanzleben, near Magdeburg,after the threshing the peasants go in procession, leading by a chain a man who is envelopedin the threshed-out straw and is called the Wolf. He represents the corn-spirit who has beencaught escaping from the threshed corn. In the district of Treves it is believed that the Corn-wolf is killed at threshing. The men thresh the last sheaf till it is reduced to chopped straw. Inthis way they think that the Corn-wolf, who was lurking in the last sheaf, has been certainlykilled.In France also the Corn-wolf appears at harvest. Thus they call out to the reaper of the lastcorn, “You will catch the Wolf.” Near Chambéry they form a ring round the last standing corn,and cry, “The Wolf is in there.” In Finisterre, when the reaping draws near an end, the har-vesters cry, “There is the Wolf; we will catch him.” Each takes a swath to reap, and he whofinishes first calls out, “I’ve caught the Wolf.” In Guyenne, when the last corn has beenreaped, they lead a wether all round the field. It is called “the Wolf of the field.” Its horns aredecked with a wreath of flowers and corn-ears, and its neck and body are also encircled withgarlands and ribbons. All the reapers march, singing, behind it. Then it is killed on the field. Inthis part of France the last sheaf is called the coujoulage, which, in the patois, means awether. Hence the killing of the wether represents the death of the corn-spirit, considered aspresent in the last sheaf; but two different conceptions of the corn-spirit—as a wolf and as awether—are mixed up together.Sometimes it appears to be thought that the Wolf, caught in the last corn, lives during thewinter in the farmhouse, ready to renew his activity as corn-spirit in the spring. Hence at mid-winter, when the lengthening days begin to herald the approach of spring, the Wolf makes hisappearance once more. In Poland a man, with a wolf’s skin thrown over his head, is led aboutat Christmas; or a stuffed wolf is carried about by persons who collect money. There are factsPage 348"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"which point to an old custom of leading about a man enveloped in leaves and called the Wolf,while his conductors collected money.3. THE CORN-SPIRIT AS A COCKAnother form which the corn-spirit often assumes is that of a cock. In Austria children arewarned against straying in the corn-fields, because the Corn-cock sits there, and will pecktheir eyes out. In North Germany they say that “the Cock sits in the last sheaf”; and at cuttingthe last corn the reapers cry, “Now we will chase out the Cock.” When it is cut they say, “Wehave caught the Cock.” At Braller, in Transylvania, when the reapers come to the last patch ofcorn, they cry, “Here we shall catch the Cock.” At Fürstenwalde, when the last sheaf is aboutto be bound, the master releases a cock, which he has brought in a basket, and lets it runover the field. All the harvesters chase it till they catch it. Elsewhere the harvesters all try toseize the last corn cut; he who succeeds in grasping it must crow, and is called Cock. Amongthe Wends it is or used to be customary for the farmer to hide a live cock under the last sheafas it lay on the field; and when the corn was being gathered up, the harvester who lightedupon this sheaf had a right to keep the cock, provided he could catch it. This formed the closeof the harvest-festival and was known as “the Cock-catching,” and the beer which was servedout to the reapers at this time went by the name of “Cock-beer.” The last sheaf is called Cock,Cock-sheaf, Harvest-cock, Harvest-hen, Autumn-hen. A distinction is made between a Wheat-cock, Bean-cock, and so on, according to the crop. At Wünschensuhl, in Thüringen, the lastsheaf is made into the shape of a cock, and called the Harvest-cock. A figure of a cock, madeof wood, pasteboard, ears of corn, or flowers, is borne in front of the harvest-waggon, espe-cially in Westphalia, where the cock carries in his beak fruits of the earth of all kinds.Sometimes the image of the cock is fastened to the top of a May-tree on the last harvest-waggon. Elsewhere a live cock, or a figure of one, is attached to a harvest-crown and carriedon a pole. In Galicia and elsewhere this live cock is fastened to the garland of corn-ears orflowers, which the leader of the women-reapers carries on her head as she marches in frontof the harvest procession. In Silesia a live cock is presented to the master on a plate. Theharvest-supper is called Harvest-cock, Stubble-cock, etc., and a chief dish at it, at least insome places, is a cock. If a waggoner upsets a harvest-waggon, it is said that “he has spiltthe Harvest-cock,” and he loses the cock, that is, the harvest-supper. The harvest-waggon,with the figure of the cock on it, is driven round the farmhouse before it is taken to the barn.Then the cock is nailed over or at the side of the house-door, or on the gable, and remainsthere till next harvest. In East Friesland the person who gives the last stroke at threshing iscalled the Clucking-hen, and grain is strewed before him as if he were a hen.Again, the corn-spirit is killed in the form of a cock. In parts of Germany, Hungary, Poland,and Picardy the reapers place a live cock in the corn which is to be cut last, and chase it overthe field, or bury it up to the neck in the ground; afterwards they strike off its head with a sick-le or scythe. In many parts of Westphalia, when the harvesters bring the wooden cock to thefarmer, he gives them a live cock, which they kill with whips or sticks, or behead with an oldsword, or throw into the barn to the girls, or give to the mistress to cook. It the Harvest-cockhas not been spilt—that is, if no waggon has been upset—the harvesters have the right to killthe farmyard cock by throwing stones at it or beheading it. Where this custom has fallen intodisuse, it is still common for the farmer’s wife to make cockie-leekie for the harvesters, and toshow them the head of the cock which has been killed for the soup. In the neighbourhood ofKlausenburg, Transylvania, a cock is buried on the harvest-field in the earth, so that only itshead appears. A young man then takes a scythe and cuts off the cock’s head at a singlesweep. If he fails to do this, he is called the Red Cock for a whole year, and people fear thatPage 349"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"next year’s crop will be bad. Near Udvarhely, in Transylvania, a live cock is bound up in thelast sheaf and killed with a spit. It is then skinned. The flesh is thrown away, but the skin andfeathers are kept till next year; and in spring the grain from the last sheaf is mixed with thefeathers of the cock and scattered on the field which is to be tilled. Nothing could set in aclearer light the identification of the cock with the spirit of the corn. By being tied up in the lastsheaf and killed, the cock is identified with the corn, and its death with the cutting of the corn.By keeping its feathers till spring, then mixing them with the seed-corn taken from the verysheaf in which the bird had been bound, and scattering the feathers together with the seedover the field, the identity of the bird with the corn is again emphasised, and its quickeningand fertilising power, as an embodiment of the corn-spirit, is intimated in the plainest manner.Thus the corn-spirit, in the form of a cock, is killed at harvest, but rises to fresh life and activi-ty in spring. Again, the equivalence of the cock to the corn is expressed, hardly less plainly, inthe custom of burying the bird in the ground, and cutting off its head (like the ears of corn)with the scythe.4. THE CORN-SPIRIT AS A HAREAnother common embodiment of the corn-spirit is the hare. In Galloway the reaping of thelast standing corn is called “cutting the Hare.” The mode of cutting it is as follows. When therest of the corn has been reaped, a handful is left standing to form the Hare. It is divided intothree parts and plaited, and the ears are tied in a knot. The reapers then retire a few yardsand each throws his or her sickle in turn at the Hare to cut it down. It must be cut below theknot, and the reapers continue to throw their sickles at it, one after the other, until one ofthem succeeds in severing the stalks below the knot. The Hare is then carried home andgiven to a maidservant in the kitchen, who places it over the kitchen-door on the inside.Sometimes the Hare used to be thus kept till the next harvest. In the parish of Minnigaff,when the Hare was cut, the unmarried reapers ran home with all speed, and the one whoarrived first was the first to be married. In Germany also one of the names for the last sheaf isthe Hare. Thus in some parts of Anhalt, when the corn has been reaped and only a few stalksare left standing, they say, “The Hare will soon come,” or the reapers cry to each other, “Lookhow the Hare comes jumping out.” In East Prussia they say that the Hare sits in the lastpatch of standing corn, and must be chased out by the last reaper. The reapers hurry withtheir work, each being anxious not to have “to chase out the Hare”; for the man who does so,that is, who cuts the last corn, is much laughed at. At Aurich, as we have seen, an expressionfor cutting the last corn is “to cut off the Hare’s tail.” “He is killing the Hare” is commonly saidof the man who cuts the last corn in Germany, Sweden, Holland, France, and Italy. In Norwaythe man who is thus said to “kill the Hare” must give “hare’s blood,” in the form of brandy, tohis fellows to drink. In Lesbos, when the reapers are at work in two neighbouring fields, eachparty tries to finish first in order to drive the Hare into their neighbour’s field; the reapers whosucceed in doing so believe that next year the crop will be better. A small sheaf of corn ismade up and kept beside the holy picture till next harvest.5. THE CORN-SPIRIT AS A CATAgain, the corn-spirit sometimes takes the form of a cat. Near Kiel children are warned not togo into the corn-fields because “the Cat sits there.” In the Eisenach Oberland they are told“the Corn-cat will come and fetch you,” “the Corn-cat goes in the corn.” In some parts ofSilesia at mowing the last corn they say, “The Cat is caught”; and at threshing, the man whogives the last stroke is called the Cat. In the neighbourhood of Lyons the last sheaf and theharvest-supper are both called the Cat. About Vesoul when they cut the last corn they say,Page 350"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"“We have the Cat by the tail.” At Briançon, in Dauphiné, at the beginning of reaping, a cat isdecked out with ribbons, flowers, and ears of corn. It is called the Cat of the ball-skin (le chatde peau de balle). If a reaper is wounded at his work, they make the cat lick the wound. Atthe close of the reaping the cat is again decked out with ribbons and ears of corn; then theydance and make merry. When the dance is over the girls solemnly strip the cat of its finery. AtGrüneberg, in Silesia, the reaper who cuts the last corn goes by the name of the Tom-cat. Heis enveloped in rye-stalks and green withes, and is furnished with a long plaited tail.Sometimes as a companion he has a man similarly dressed, who is called the (female) Cat.Their duty is to run after people whom they see and to beat them with a long stick. NearAmiens the expression for finishing the harvest is, “They are going to kill the Cat”; and whenthe last corn is cut they kill a cat in the farmyard. At threshing, in some parts of France, a livecat is placed under the last bundle of corn to be threshed, and is struck dead with the flails.Then on Sunday it is roasted and eaten as a holiday dish. In the Vosges Mountains the closeof haymaking or harvest is called “catching the cat,” “killing the dog,” or more rarely “catchingthe hare.” The cat, the dog, or the hare is said to be fat or lean according as the crop is goodor bad. The man who cuts the last handful of hay or of wheat is said to catch the cat or thehare or to kill the dog.6. THE CORN-SPIRIT AS A GOATFurther, the corn-spirit often appears in the form of a goat. In some parts of Prussia, when thecorn bends before the wind, they say, “The Goats are chasing each other,” “the wind is drivingthe Goats through the corn,” “the Goats are browsing there,” and they expect a very goodharvest. Again they say, “The Oats-goat is sitting in the oats-field,” “the Corn-goat is sitting inthe rye-field.” Children are warned not to go into the corn-fields to pluck the blue corn-flowers,or amongst the beans to pluck pods, because the Rye-goat, the Corn-goat, the Oats-goat, orthe Bean-goat is sitting or lying there, and will carry them away or kill them. When a harvesteris taken sick or lags behind his fellows at their work, they call out, “The Harvest-goat haspushed him,” “he has been pushed by the Corn-goat.” In the neighbourhood of Braunsberg(East Prussia) at binding the oats every harvester makes haste “lest the Corn-goat push him.”At Oefoten, in Norway, each reaper has his allotted patch to reap. When a reaper in the mid-dle has not finished reaping his piece after his neighbours have finished theirs, they say ofhim, “He remains on the island.” And if the laggard is a man, they imitate the cry with whichthey call a he-goat; if a woman, the cry with which they call a she-goat. Near Straubing, inLower Bavaria, it is said of the man who cuts the last corn that “he has the Corn-goat, or theWheat-goat, or the Oats-goat,” according to the crop. Moreover, two horns are set up on thelast heap of corn, and it is called “the horned Goat.” At Kreutzburg, East Prussia, they call outto the woman who is binding the last sheaf, “The Goat is sitting in the sheaf.” At Gablingen, inSwabia, when the last field of oats upon a farm is being reaped, the reapers carve a goat outof wood. Ears of oats are inserted in its nostrils and mouth, and it is adorned with garlands offlowers. It is set up on the field and called the Oats-goat. When the reaping approaches anend, each reaper hastens to finish his piece first; he who is the last to finish gets the Oats-goat. Again, the last sheaf is itself called the Goat. Thus, in the valley of the Wiesent, Bavaria,the last sheaf bound on the field is called the Goat, and they have a proverb, “The field mustbear a goat.” At Spachbrücken, in Hesse, the last handful of corn which is cut is called theGoat, and the man who cuts it is much ridiculed. At Dürrenbüchig and about Mosbach inBaden the last sheaf is also called the Goat. Sometimes the last sheaf is made up in the formof a goat, and they say, “The Goat is sitting in it.” Again, the person who cuts or binds the lastsheaf is called the Goat. Thus, in parts of Mecklenburg they call out to the woman who bindsthe last sheaf, “You are the Harvest-goat.” Near Uelzen, in Hanover, the harvest festivalPage 351"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"begins with “the bringing of the Harvest-goat”; that is, the woman who bound the last sheaf iswrapt in straw, crowned with a harvest-wreath, and brought in a wheel-barrow to the village,where a round dance takes place. About Luneburg, also, the woman who binds the last cornis decked with a crown of corn-ears and is called the Corn-goat. At Münzesheim in Baden thereaper who cuts the last handful of corn or oats is called the Corn-goat or the Oats-goat. Inthe Canton St. Gall, Switzerland, the person who cuts the last handful of corn on the field, ordrives the last harvest-waggon to the barn, is called the Corn-goat or the Rye-goat, or simplythe Goat. In the Canton Thurgau he is called Corn-goat; like a goat he has a bell hung roundhis neck, is led in triumph, and drenched with liquor. In parts of Styria, also, the man who cutsthe last corn is called Corn-goat, Oats-goat, or the like. As a rule, the man who thus gets thename of Corn-goat has to bear it a whole year till the next harvest.According to one view, the corn-spirit, who has been caught in the form of a goat or other-wise, lives in the farmhouse or barn over winter. Thus, each farm has its own embodiment ofthe corn-spirit. But, according to another view, the corn-spirit is the genius or deity, not of thecorn of one farm only, but of all the corn. Hence when the corn on one farm is all cut, he fleesto another where there is still corn left standing. This idea is brought out in a harvest-customwhich was formerly observed in Skye. The farmer who first finished reaping sent a man orwoman with a sheaf to a neighbouring farmer who had not finished; the latter in his turn,when he had finished, sent on the sheaf to his neighbour who was still reaping; and so thesheaf made the round of the farms till all the corn was cut. The sheaf was called the goabbirbhacagh, that is, the Cripple Goat. The custom appears not to be extinct at the present day,for it was reported from Skye not very many years ago. The corn-spirit was probably thus rep-resented as lame because he had been crippled by the cutting of the corn. Sometimes theold woman who brings home the last sheaf must limp on one foot.But sometimes the corn-spirit, in the form of a goat, is believed to be slain on the harvest-fieldby the sickle or scythe. Thus, in the neighbourhood of Bernkastel, on the Moselle, the reapersdetermine by lot the order in which they shall follow each other. The first is called the fore-reaper, the last the tail-bearer. If a reaper overtakes the man in front he reaps past him, bend-ing round so as to leave the slower reaper in a patch by himself. This patch is called theGoat; and the man for whom “the Goat is cut” in this way, is laughed and jeered at by his fel-lows for the rest of the day. When the tail-bearer cuts the last ears of corn, it is said, “He iscutting the Goat’s neck off.” In the neighbourhood of Grenoble, before the end of the reaping,a live goat is adorned with flowers and ribbons and allowed to run about the field. Thereapers chase it and try to catch it. When it is caught, the farmer’s wife holds it fast while thefarmer cuts off its head. The goat’s flesh serves to furnish the harvest-supper. A piece of theflesh is pickled and kept till the next harvest, when another goat is killed. Then all the har-vesters eat of the flesh. On the same day the skin of the goat is made into a cloak, which thefarmer, who works with his men, must always wear at harvest-time if rain or bad weather setsin. But if a reaper gets pains in his back, the farmer gives him the goat-skin to wear. The rea-son for this seems to be that the pains in the back, being inflicted by the corn-spirit, can alsobe healed by it. Similarly, we saw that elsewhere, when a reaper is wounded at reaping, acat, as the representative of the corn-spirit, is made to lick the wound. Esthonian reapers ofthe island of Mon think that the man who cuts the first ears of corn at harvest will get pains inhis back, probably because the corn-spirit is believed to resent especially the first wound;and, in order to escape pains in the back, Saxon reapers in Transylvania gird their loins withthe first handful of ears which they cut. Here, again, the corn-spirit is applied to for healing orprotection, but in his original vegetable form, not in the form of a goat or a cat.Page 352"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Further, the corn-spirit under the form of a goat is sometimes conceived as lurking among thecut corn in the barn, till he is driven from it by the threshing-flail. Thus in Baden the last sheafto be threshed is called the Corn-goat, the Spelt-goat, or the Oats-goat according to the kindof grain. Again, near Marktl, in Upper Bavaria, the sheaves are called Straw-goats or simplyGoats. They are laid in a great heap on the open field and threshed by two rows of menstanding opposite each other, who, as they ply their flails, sing a song in which they say thatthey see the Straw-goat amongst the corn-stalks. The last Goat, that is, the last sheaf, isadorned with a wreath of violets and other flowers and with cakes strung together. It is placedright in the middle of the heap. Some of the threshers rush at it and tear the best of it out;others lay on with their flails so recklessly that heads are sometimes broken. At Oberinntal, inthe Tyrol, the last thresher is called Goat. So at Haselberg, in West Bohemia, the man whogives the last stroke at threshing oats is called the Oats-goat. At Tettnang, in Würtemburg, thethresher who gives the last stroke to the last bundle of corn before it is turned goes by thename of the He-goat, and it is said, “He has driven the He-goat away.” The person who, afterthe bundle has been turned, gives the last stroke of all, is called the She-goat. In this customit is implied that the corn is inhabited by a pair of corn-spirits, male and female.Further, the corn-spirit, captured in the form of a goat at threshing, is passed on to a neigh-bour whose threshing is not yet finished. In Franche Comté, as soon as the threshing is over,the young people set up a straw figure of a goat on the farmyard of a neighbour who is stillthreshing. He must give them wine or money in return. At Ellwangen, in Würtemburg, the effi-gy of a goat is made out of the last bundle of corn at threshing; four sticks form its legs, andtwo its horns. The man who gives the last stroke with the flail must carry the Goat to the barnof a neighbour who is still threshing and throw it down on the floor; if he is caught in the act,they tie the Goat on his back. A similar custom is observed at Indersdorf, in Upper Bavaria;the man who throws the straw Goat into the neighbour’s barn imitates the bleating of a goat;if they catch him, they blacken his face and tie the Goat on his back. At Saverne, in Alsace,when a farmer is a week or more behind his neighbours with his threshing, they set a realstuffed goat or fox before his door.Sometimes the spirit of the corn in goat form is believed to be killed at threshing. In the dis-trict of Traunstein, Upper Bavaria, they think that the Oats-goat is in the last sheaf of oats. Heis represented by an old rake set up on end, with an old pot for a head. The children are thentold to kill the Oats-goat.7. THE CORN-SPIRIT AS A BULL, COW, OR OXAnother form which the corn-spirit often assumes is that of a bull, cow, or ox. When the windsweeps over the corn they say at Conitz, in West Prussia, “The Steer is running in the corn”;when the corn is thick and strong in one spot, they say in some parts of East Prussia, “TheBull is lying in the corn.” When a harvester has overstrained and lamed himself, they say inthe Graudenz district of West Prussia, “The Bull pushed him”; in Lorraine they say, “He hasthe Bull.” The meaning of both expressions is that he has unwittingly lighted upon the divinecorn-spirit, who has punished the profane intruder with lameness. So near Chambéry when areaper wounds himself with his sickle, it is said that he has “the wound of the Ox.” In the dis-trict of Bunzlau (Silesia) the last sheaf is sometimes made into the shape of a horned ox,stuffed with tow and wrapt in corn-ears. This figure is called the Old Man. In some parts ofBohemia the last sheaf is made up in human form and called the Buffalo-bull. These casesshow a confusion of the human with the animal shape of the corn-spirit. The confusion is likethat of killing a wether under the name of a wolf. All over Swabia the last bundle of corn onPage 353"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"the field is called the Cow; the man who cuts the last ears “has the Cow,” and is himselfcalled Cow or Barley-cow or Oats-cow, according to the crop; at the harvest-supper he gets anosegay of flowers and corn-ears and a more liberal allowance of drink than the rest. But heis teased and laughed at; so no one likes to be the Cow. The Cow was sometimes represent-ed by the figure of a woman made out of ears of corn and corn-flowers. It was carried to thefarmhouse by the man who had cut the last handful of corn. The children ran after him andthe neighbours turned out to laugh at him, till the farmer took the Cow from him. Here againthe confusion between the human and the animal form of the corn-spirit is apparent. In vari-ous parts of Switzerland the reaper who cuts the last ears of corn is called Wheat-cow, Corn-cow, Oats-cow, or Corn-steer, and is the butt of many a joke. On the other hand, in the districtof Rosenheim, Upper Bavaria, when a farmer is later of getting in his harvest than his neigh-bours, they set up on his land a Straw-bull, as it is called. This is a gigantic figure of a bullmade of stubble on a framework of wood and adorned with flowers and leaves. Attached to itis a label on which are scrawled doggerel verses in ridicule of the man on whose land theStraw-bull is set up.Again, the corn-spirit in the form of a bull or ox is killed on the harvest-field at the close of thereaping. At Pouilly, near Dijon, when the last ears of corn are about to be cut, an ox adornedwith ribbons, flowers, and ears of corn is led all round the field, followed by the whole troop ofreapers dancing. Then a man disguised as the Devil cuts the last ears of corn and immediate-ly slaughters the ox. Part of the flesh of the animal is eaten at the harvest-supper; part ispickled and kept till the first day of sowing in spring. At Pont à Mousson and elsewhere on theevening of the last day of reaping, a calf adorned with flowers and ears of corn is led thriceround the farmyard, being allured by a bait or driven by men with sticks, or conducted by thefarmer’s wife with a rope. The calf chosen for this ceremony is the calf which was born firston the farm in the spring of the year. It is followed by all the reapers with their tools. Then it isallowed to run free; the reapers chase it, and whoever catches it is called King of the Calf.Lastly, it is solemnly killed; at Lunéville the man who acts as butcher is the Jewish merchantof the village.Sometimes again the corn-spirit hides himself amongst the cut corn in the barn to reappear inbull or cow form at threshing. Thus at Wurmlingen, in Thüringen, the man who gives the laststroke at threshing is called the Cow, or rather the Barley-cow, Oats-cow, Peas-cow, or thelike, according to the crop. He is entirely enveloped in straw; his head is surmounted by sticksin imitation of horns, and two lads lead him by ropes to the well to drink. On the way thitherhe must low like a cow, and for a long time afterwards he goes by the name of the Cow. AtObermedlingen, in Swabia, when the threshing draws near an end, each man is careful toavoid giving the last stroke. He who does give it “gets the Cow,” which is a straw figuredressed in an old ragged petticoat, hood, and stockings. It is tied on his back with a straw-rope; his face is blackened, and being bound with straw-ropes to a wheelbarrow he iswheeled round the village. Here, again, we meet with that confusion between the human andanimal shape of the corn-spirit which we have noted in other customs. In CantonSchaffhausen the man who threshes the last corn is called the Cow; in Canton Thurgau, theCorn-bull; in Canton Zurich, the Thresher-cow. In the last-mentioned district he is wrapt instraw and bound to one of the trees in the orchard. At Arad, in Hungary, the man who givesthe last stroke at threshing is enveloped in straw and a cow’s hide with the horns attached toit. At Pessnitz, in the district of Dresden, the man who gives the last stroke with the flail iscalled Bull. He must make a straw-man and set it up before a neighbour’s window. Here,apparently, as in so many cases, the corn-spirit is passed on to a neighbour who has not fin-ished threshing. So at Herbrechtingen, in Thüringen, the effigy of a ragged old woman is flungPage 354"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"into the barn of the farmer who is last with his threshing. The man who throws it in cries,“There is the Cow for you.” If the threshers catch him they detain him over night and punishhim by keeping him from the harvest-supper. In these latter customs the confusion betweenthe human and the animal shape of the corn-spirit meets us again.Further, the corn-spirit in bull form is sometimes believed to be killed at threshing. At Auxerre,in threshing the last bundle of corn, they call out twelve times, “We are killing the Bull.” In theneighbourhood of Bordeaux, where a butcher kills an ox on the field immediately after theclose of the reaping, it is said of the man who gives the last stroke at threshing that “he haskilled the Bull.” At Chambéry the last sheaf is called the sheaf of the Young Ox, and a racetakes place to it in which all the reapers join. When the last stroke is given at threshing theysay that “the Ox is killed”; and immediately thereupon a real ox is slaughtered by the reaperwho cut the last corn. The flesh of the ox is eaten by the threshers at supper.We have seen that sometimes the young corn-spirit, whose task it is to quicken the corn ofthe coming year, is believed to be born as a Corn-baby on the harvest-field. Similarly in Berrythe young corn-spirit is sometimes supposed to be born on the field in calf form; for when abinder has not rope enough to bind all the corn in sheaves, he puts aside the wheat thatremains over and imitates the lowing of a cow. The meaning is that “the sheaf has given birthto a calf.” In Puy-de-Dôme when a binder cannot keep up with the reaper whom he or she fol-lows, they say “He (or she) is giving birth to the Calf.” In some parts of Prussia, in similar cir-cumstances, they call out to the woman, “The Bull is coming,” and imitate the bellowing of abull. In these cases the woman is conceived as the Corn-cow or old corn-spirit, while the sup-posed calf is the Corn-calf or young corn-spirit. In some parts of Austria a mythical calf(Muhkälbchen) is believed to be seen amongst the sprouting corn in spring and to push thechildren; when the corn waves in the wind they say, “The Calf is going about.” Clearly, asMannhardt observes, this calf of the spring-time is the same animal which is afterwardsbelieved to be killed at reaping.8. THE CORN-SPIRIT AS A HORSE OR MARESometimes the corn-spirit appears in the shape of a horse or mare. Between Kalw andStuttgart, when the corn bends before the wind, they say, “There runs the Horse.” AtBohlingen, near Radolfzell in Baden, the last sheaf of oats is called the Oats-stallion. InHertfordshire, at the end of the reaping, there is or used to be observed a ceremony called“crying the Mare.” The last blades of corn left standing on the field are tied together andcalled the Mare. The reapers stand at a distance and throw their sickles at it; he who cuts itthrough “has the prize, with acclamations and good cheer.” After it is cut the reapers cry thricewith a loud voice, “I have her!” Others answer thrice, “What have you?”—”A Mare! a Mare! aMare!”—”Whose is she?” is next asked thrice. “A. B.’s,” naming the owner thrice. “Whither willyou send her?”—”To C. D.,” naming some neighbour who has not reaped all his corn. In thiscustom the corn-spirit in the form of a mare is passed on from a farm where the corn is all cutto another farm where it is still standing, and where therefore the corn-spirit may be supposednaturally to take refuge. In Shropshire the custom is similar. The farmer who finishes his har-vest last, and who therefore cannot send the Mare to any one else, is said “to keep her allwinter.” The mocking offer of the Mare to a laggard neighbour was sometimes responded toby a mocking acceptance of her help. Thus an old man told an inquirer, “While we wun atsupper, a mon cumm’d wi’ a autar [halter] to fatch her away.” At one place a real mare usedto be sent, but the man who rode her was subjected to some rough treatment at the farm-house to which he paid his unwelcome visit.Page 355"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"In the neighbourhood of Lille the idea of the corn-spirit in horse form in clearly preserved.When a harvester grows weary at his work, it is said, “He has the fatigue of the Horse.” Thefirst sheaf, called the “Cross of the Horse,” is placed on a cross of boxwood in the barn, andthe youngest horse on the farm must tread on it. The reapers dance round the last blades ofcorn, crying, “See the remains of the Horse.” The sheaf made out of these last blades isgiven to the youngest horse of the parish (commune) to eat. This youngest horse of theparish clearly represents, as Mannhardt says, the corn-spirit of the following year, the Corn-foal, which absorbs the spirit of the old Corn-horse by eating the last corn cut; for, as usual,the old corn-spirit takes his final refuge in the last sheaf. The thresher of the last sheaf is saidto “beat the Horse.”9. THE CORN-SPIRIT AS A PIG (BOAR OR SOW)The last animal embodiment of the corn-spirit which we shall notice is the pig (boar or sow).In Thüringen, when the wind sets the young corn in motion, they sometimes say, “The Boar isrushing through the corn.” Amongst the Esthonians of the island of Oesel the last sheaf iscalled the Ryeboar, and the man who gets it is saluted with a cry of “You have the Rye-boaron your back!” In reply he strikes up a song, in which he prays for plenty. At Kohlerwinkel,near Augsburg, at the close of the harvest, the last bunch of standing corn is cut down, stalkby stalk, by all the reapers in turn. He who cuts the last stalk “gets the Sow,” and is laughedat. In other Swabian villages also the man who cuts the last corn “has the Sow,” or “has theRye-sow.” At Bohlingen, near Radolfzell in Baden, the last sheaf is called the Rye-sow or theWheat-sow, according to the crop; and at Röhrenbach in Baden the person who brings thelast armful for the last sheaf is called the Corn-sow or the Oats-sow. At Friedingen, in Swabia,the thresher who gives the last stroke is called Sow—Barley-sow, Corn-sow, or the like,according to the crop. At Onstmettingen the man who gives the last stroke at threshing “hasthe Sow”; he is often bound up in a sheaf and dragged by a rope along the ground. And, gen-erally, in Swabia the man who gives the last stroke with the flail is called Sow. He may, how-ever, rid himself of this invidious distinction by passing on to a neighbour the straw-rope,which is the badge of his position as Sow. So he goes to a house and throws the straw-ropeinto it, crying, “There, I bring you the Sow.” All the inmates give chase; and if they catch himthey beat him, shut him up for several hours in the pig-sty, and oblige him to take the “Sow”away again. In various parts of Upper Bavaria the man who gives the last stroke at threshingmust “carry the Pig”—that is, either a straw effigy of a pig or merely a bundle of straw-ropes.This he carries to a neighbouring farm where the threshing is not finished, and throws it intothe barn. If the threshers catch him they handle him roughly, beating him, blackening or dirty-ing his face, throwing him into filth, binding the Sow on his back, and so on; if the bearer ofthe Sow is a woman they cut off her hair. At the harvest supper or dinner the man who “car-ried the Pig” gets one or more dumplings made in the form of pigs. When the dumplings areserved up by the maidservant, all the people at table cry “Süz, süz, süz!” that being the cryused in calling pigs. Sometimes after dinner the man who “carried the Pig” has his face black-ened, and is set on a cart and drawn round the village by his fellows, followed by a crowd cry-ing “Süz, süz, süz!” as if they were calling swine. Sometimes, after being wheeled round thevillage, he is flung on the dunghill.Again, the corn-spirit in the form of a pig plays his part at sowing-time as well as at harvest.At Neuautz, in Courland, when barley is sown for the first time in the year, the farmer’s wifeboils the chine of a pig along with the tail, and brings it to the sower on the field. He eats of it,but cuts offPage 356"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"the tail and sticks it in the field; it is believed that the ears of corn will then grow as long asthe tail. Here the pig is the corn-spirit, whose fertilising power is sometimes supposed to lieespecially in his tail. As a pig he is put in the ground at sowing-time, and as a pig he reap-pears amongst the ripe corn at harvest. For amongst the neighbouring Esthonians, as wehave seen, the last sheaf is called the Rye-boar. Somewhat similar customs are observed inGermany. In the Salza district, near Meiningen, a certain bone in the pig is called “the Jew onthe winnowing-fan.” The flesh of this bone is boiled on Shrove Tuesday, but the bone is putamongst the ashes which the neighbours exchange as presents on St. Peter’s Day (the twen-ty-second of February), and then mix with the seedcorn. In the whole of Hesse, Meiningen,and other districts, people eat pea-soup with dried pig-ribs on Ash Wednesday or Candlemas.The ribs are then collected and hung in the room till sowing-time, when they are inserted inthe sown field or in the seed-bag amongst the flax seed. This is thought to be an infalliblespecific against earth-fleas and moles, and to cause the flax to grow well and tall.But the idea of the corn-spirit as embodied in pig form is nowhere more clearly expressedthan in the Scandinavian custom of the Yule Boar. In Sweden and Denmark at Yule(Christmas) it is the custom to bake a loaf in the form of a boar-pig. This is called the YuleBoar. The corn of the last sheaf is often used to make it. All through Yule the Yule Boarstands on the table. Often it is kept till the sowing-time in spring, when part of it is mixed withthe seed-corn and part given to the ploughman and plough-horses or ploughoxen to eat, inthe expectation of a good harvest. In this custom the corn-spirit, immanent in the last sheaf,appears at midwinter in the form of a boar made from the corn of the last sheaf; and hisquickening influence on the corn is shown by mixing part of the Yule Boar with the seed-corn,and giving part of it to the ploughman and his cattle to eat. Similarly we saw that the Corn-wolf makes his appearance at mid-winter, the time when the year begins to verge towardsspring. Formerly a real boar was sacrificed at Christmas, and apparently also a man in thecharacter of the Yule Boar. This, at least, may perhaps be inferred from a Christmas customstill observed in Sweden. A man is wrapt up in a skin, and carries a wisp of straw in hismouth, so that the projecting straws look like the bristles of a boar. A knife is brought, and anold woman, with her face blackened, pretends to sacrifice him.On Christmas Eve in some parts of the Esthonian island of Oesel they bake a long cake withthe two ends turned up. It is called the Christmas Boar, and stands on the table till the morn-ing of New Year’s Day, when it is distributed among the cattle. In other parts of the island theChristmas Boar is not a cake but a little pig born in March, which the housewife fattenssecretly, often without the knowledge of the other members of the family. On Christmas Evethe little pig is secretly killed, then roasted in the oven, and set on the table standing on allfours, where it remains in this posture for several days. In other parts of the island, again,though the Christmas cake has neither the name nor the shape of a boar, it is kept till theNew Year, when half of it is divided among all the members and all the quadrupeds of thefamily. The other half of the cake is kept till sowing-time comes round, when it is similarly dis-tributed in the morning among human beings and beasts. In other parts of Esthonia, again,the Christmas Boar, as it is called, is baked of the first rye cut at harvest; it has a conicalshape and a cross is impressed on it with a pig’s bone or a key, or three dints are made in itwith a buckle or a piece of charcoal. It stands with a light beside it on the table all through thefestal season. On New Year’s Day and Epiphany, before sunrise, a little of the cake is crum-bled with salt and given to the cattle. The rest is kept till the day when the cattle are drivenout to pasture for the first time in spring. It is then put in the herdsman’s bag, and at eveningis divided among the cattle to guard them from magic and harm. In some places theChristmas Boar is partaken of by farm-servants and cattle at the time of the barley sowing, forPage 357"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"the purpose of thereby producing a heavier crop.10. ON THE ANIMAL EMBODIMENTS OF THE CORN-SPIRITSo much for the animal embodiments of the corn-spirit as they are presented to us in the folk-customs of Northern Europe. These customs bring out clearly the sacramental character ofthe harvest-supper. The corn-spirit is conceived as embodied in an animal; this divine animalis slain, and its flesh and blood are partaken of by the harvesters. Thus the cock, the hare,the cat, the goat, and the OX are eaten sacramentally by the harvester, and the pig is eatensacramentally by ploughmen in spring. Again, as a substitute for the real flesh of the divinebeing, bread or dumplings are made in his image and eaten sacramentally; thus, pig-shapeddumplings are eaten by the harvesters, and loaves made in boar-shape (the Yule Boar) areeaten in spring by the ploughman and his cattle.The reader has probably remarked the complete parallelism between the conceptions of thecorn-spirit in human and in animal form. The parallel may be here briefly resumed. When thecorn waves in the wind it is said either that the Corn-mother or that the Corn-wolf, etc., ispassing through the corn. Children are warned against straying in corn-fields either becausethe Corn-mother or because the Corn-wolf, etc., is there. In the last corn cut or the last sheafthreshed either the Corn-mother or the Corn-wolf, etc., is supposed to be present. The lastsheaf is itself called either the Corn-mother or the Corn-wolf, etc., and is made up in theshape either of a woman or of a wolf, etc. The person who cuts, binds, or threshes the lastsheaf is called either the Old Woman or the Wolf, etc., according to the name bestowed onthe sheaf itself. As in some places a sheaf made in human form and called the Maiden, theMother of the Maize, etc., is kept from one harvest to the next in order to secure a continu-ance of the corn-spirit’s blessing, so in some places the Harvest-cock and in others the fleshof the goat is kept for a similar purpose from one harvest to the next. As in some places thegrain taken from the Corn-mother is mixed with the seed-corn in spring to make the cropabundant, so in some places the feathers of the cock, and in Sweden the Yule Boar, are kepttill spring and mixed with the seed-corn for a like purpose. As part of the Corn-mother orMaiden is given to the cattle at Christmas or to the horses at the first ploughing, so part of theYule Boar is given to the ploughing horses or oxen in spring. Lastly, the death of the corn-spirit is represented by killing or pretending to kill either his human or his animal representa-tive; and the worshippers partake sacramentally either of the actual body and blood of therepresentative of the divinity, or of bread made in his likeness.Other animal forms assumed by the corn-spirit are the fox, stag, roe, sheep, bear, ass,mouse, quail, stork, swan, and kite. If it is asked why the corn-spirit should be thought toappear in the form of an animal and of so many different animals, we may reply that to primi-tive man the simpleappearance of an animal or bird among the corn is probably enough to suggest a mysteriouslink between the creature and the corn; and when we remember that in the old days, beforefields were fenced in, all kinds of animals must have been free to roam over them, we neednot wonder that the corn-spirit should have been identified even with large animals like thehorse and cow, which nowadays could not, except by a rare accident, be found straying in anEnglish corn-field. This explanation applies with peculiar force to the very common case inwhich the animal embodiment of the corn-spirit is believed to lurk in the last standing corn.For at harvest a number of wild animals, such as hares, rabbits, and partridges, are common-ly driven by the progress of the reaping into the last patch of standing corn, and make theirescape from it as it is being cut down. So regularly does this happen that reapers and othersPage 358"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"often stand round the last patch of corn armed with sticks or guns, with which they kill the ani-mals as they dart out of their last refuge among the stalks. Now, primitive man, to whom mag-ical changes of shape seem perfectly credible, finds it most natural that the spirit of the corn,driven from his home in the ripe grain, should make his escape in the form of the animalwhich is seen to rush out of the last patch of corn as it falls under the scythe of the reaper.Thus the identification of the corn-spirit with an animal is analogous to the identification of himwith a passing stranger. As the sudden appearance of a stranger near the harvest-field orthreshing-floor is, to the primitive mind, enough to identify him as the spirit of the corn escap-ing from the cut or threshed corn, so the sudden appearance of an animal issuing from thecut corn is enough to identify it with the corn-spirit escaping from his ruined home. The twoidentifications are so analogous that they can hardly be dissociated in any attempt to explainthem. Those who look to some other principle than the one here suggested for the explana-tion of the latter identification are bound to show that their theory covers the former identifica-tion also.Chapter XLIXAncient Deities of Vegetation as Animals1. DIONYSUS, THE GOAT AND THE BULLHOWEVER we may explain it, the fact remains that in peasant folk-lore the corn-spirit is verycommonly conceived and represented in animal form. May not this fact explain the relation inwhich certain animals stood to the ancient deities of vegetation, Dionysus, Demeter, Adonis,Attis, and Osiris?To begin with Dionysus. We have seen that he was represented sometimes as a goat andsometimes as a bull. As a goat he can hardly be separated from the minor divinities, thePans, Satyrs, and Silenuses, all of whom are closely associated with him and are represent-ed more or less completely in the form of goats. Thus, Pan was regularly portrayed in sculp-ture and painting with the face and legs of a goat. The Satyrs were depicted with pointedgoat-ears, and sometimes with sprouting horns and short tails. They were sometimes spokenof simply as goats; and in the drama their parts were played by men dressed in goatskins.Silenus is represented in art clad in a goatskin. Further, the Fauns, the Italian counterpart ofthe Greek Pans and Satyrs, are described as being half goats, with goat-feet and goat-horns.Again, all these minor goat-formed divinities partake more or less clearly of the character ofwoodland deities. Thus, Pan was called by the Arcadians the Lord of the Wood. TheSilenuses kept company with the tree-nymphs. The Fauns are expressly designated as wood-land deities; and their character as such is still further brought out by their association, oreven identification, with Silvanus and the Silvanuses, who, as their name of itself indicates,are spirits of the woods. Lastly, the association of the Satyrs with the Silenuses, Fauns, andSilvanuses, proves that the Satyrs also were woodland deities. These goat-formed spirits ofthe woods have their counterparts in the folk-lore of Northern Europe. Thus, the Russianwood-spirits, called Ljeschie (from ljes, “wood”), are believed to appear partly in humanshape, but with the horns, ears, and legs of goats. The Ljeschi can alter his stature at pleas-ure; when he walks in the wood he is as tall as the trees; when he walks in the meadows heis no higher than the grass. Some of the Ljeschie are spirits of the corn as well as of thewood; before harvest they are as tall as the corn-stalks, but after it they shrink to the height ofthe stubble. This brings out—what we have remarked before—the close connexion betweentree-spirits and corn-spirits, and shows how easily the former may melt into the latter.Similarly the Fauns, though wood-spirits, were believed to foster the growth of the crops. WePage 359"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"have already seen how often the corn-spirit is represented in folk-custom as a goat. On thewhole, then, as Mannhardt argues, the Pans, Satyrs, and Fauns perhaps belong to a widelydiffused class of wood-spirits conceived in goat-form. The fondness of goats for straying inwoods and nibbling the bark of trees, to which indeed they are most destructive, is an obvi-ous and perhaps sufficient reason why wood-spirits should so often be supposed to take theform of goats. The inconsistency of a god of vegetation subsisting upon the vegetation whichhe personifies is not one to strike the primitive mind. Such inconsistencies arise when thedeity, ceasing to be immanent in the vegetation, comes to be regarded as its owner or lord;for the idea of owning the vegetation naturally leads to that of subsisting on it. Sometimes thecorn-spirit, originally conceived as immanent in the corn, afterwards comes to be regarded asits owner, who lives on it and is reduced to poverty and want by being deprived of it. Hencehe is often known as “the Poor Man” or “the Poor Woman.” Occasionally the last sheaf is leftstanding on the field for “the Poor Old Woman” or for “the Old Rye-woman.”Thus the representation of wood-spirits in the form of goats appears to be both widespreadand, to the primitive mind, natural. Therefore when we find, as we have done, thatDionysus—a tree-god—is sometimes represented in goat-form, we can hardly avoid conclud-ing that this representation is simply a part of his proper character as a tree-god and is not tobe explained by the fusion of two distinct and independent worships, in one of which he origi-nally appeared as a tree-god and in the other as a goat.Dionysus was also figured, as we have seen, in the shape of a bull. After what has gonebefore we are naturally led to expect that his bull form must have been only another expres-sion for his character as a deity of vegetation, especially as the bull is a common embodimentof the corn-spirit in Northern Europe; and the close association of Dionysus with Demeter andPersephone in the mysteries of Eleusis shows that he had at least strong agricultural affini-ties.The probability of this view will be somewhat increased if it can be shown that in other ritesthan those of Dionysus the ancients slew an OX as a representative of the spirit of vegeta-tion. This they appear to have done in the Athenian sacrifice known as “the murder of the OX”(bouphonia). It took place about the end of June or beginning of July, that is, about the timewhen the threshing is nearly over in Attica. According to tradition the sacrifice was instituted toprocure a cessation of drought and dearth which had afflicted the land. The ritual was as fol-lows. Barley mixed with wheat, or cakes made of them, were laid upon the bronze altar ofZeus Polieus on the Acropolis. Oxen were driven round the altar, and the OX which went upto the altar and ate the offering on it was sacrificed. The axe and knife with which the beastwas slain had been previously wetted with water brought by maidens called “water-carriers.”The weapons were then sharpened and handed to the butchers, one of whom felled the OXwith the axe and another cut its throat with the knife. As soon as he had felled the OX, theformer threw the axe from him and fled; and the man who cut the beast’s throat apparentlyimitated his example. Meantime the OX was skinned and all present partook of its flesh. Thenthe hide was stuffed with straw and sewed up; next the stuffed animal was set on its feet andyoked to a plough as if it were ploughing. A trial then took place in an ancient law-courtpresided over by the King (as he was called) to determine who had murdered the OX. Themaidens who had brought the water accused the men who had sharpened the axe and knife;the men who had sharpened the axe and knife blamed the men who had handed theseimplements to the butchers; the men who had handed the implements to the butchers blamedthe butchers; and the butchers laid the blame on the axe and knife, which were accordinglyfound guilty, condemned, and cast into the sea.Page 360"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"The name of this sacrifice,—”the murder of the OX,”—the pains taken by each person whohad a hand in the slaughter to lay the blame on some one else, together with the formal trialand punishment of the axe or knife or both, prove that the OX was here regarded not merelyas a victim offered to a god, but as itself a sacred creature, the slaughter of which was sacri-lege or murder. This is borne out by a statement of Varro that to kill an OX was formerly acapital crime in Attica. The mode of selecting the victim suggests that the OX which tasted thecorn was viewed as the corn-deity taking possession of his own. This interpretation is sup-ported by the following custom. In Beauce, in the district of Orleans, on the twenty-fourth ortwenty-fifth of April they make a straw man called “the great mondard.” For they say that theold mondard is now dead and it is necessary to make a new one. The straw man is carried insolemn procession up and down the village and at last is placed upon the oldest apple-tree.There he remains till the apples are gathered, when he is taken down and thrown into thewater, or he is burned and his ashes cast into water. But the person who plucks the first fruitfrom the tree succeeds to the title of “the great mondard.” Here the straw figure, called “thegreat mondard” and placed on the oldest apple-tree in spring, represents the spirit of the tree,who, dead in winter, revives when the apple-blossoms appear on the boughs. Thus the per-son who plucks the first fruit from the tree and thereby receives the name of “the great mon-dard” must be regarded as a representative of the tree-spirit. Primitive peoples are usuallyreluctant to taste the annual first-fruits of any crop, until some ceremony has been performedwhich makes it safe and pious for them to do so. The reason of this reluctance appears to bea belief that the first-fruits either belong to or actually contain a divinity. Therefore when aman or animal is seen boldly to appropriate the sacred first-fruits, he or it is naturally regard-ed as the divinity himself in human or animal form taking possession of his own. The time ofthe Athenian sacrifice, which fell about the close of the threshing, suggests that the wheatand barley laid upon the altar were a harvest offering; and the sacramental character of thesubsequent repast—all partaking of the flesh of the divine animal—would make it parallel tothe harvest-suppers of modern Europe, in which, as we have seen, the flesh of the animalwhich stands for the corn-spirit is eaten by the harvesters. Again, the tradition that the sacri-fice was instituted in order to put an end to drought and famine is in favour of taking it as aharvest festival. The resurrection of the corn-spirit, enacted by setting up the stuffed OX andyoking it to the plough, may be compared with the resurrection of the tree-spirit in the personof his representative, the Wild Man.The OX appears as a representative of the corn-spirit in other parts of the world. At GreatBassam, in Guinea, two oxen are slain annually to procure a good harvest. If the sacrifice isto be effectual, it is necessary that the oxen should weep. So all the women of the village sitin front of the beasts, chanting, “The OX will weep; yes, he will weep!” From time to time oneof the women walks round the beasts, throwing manioc meal or palm wine upon them, espe-cially into their eyes. When tears roll down from the eyes of the oxen, the people dance,singing, “The OX weeps! the OX weeps!” Then two men seize the tails of the beasts and cutthem off at one blow. It is believed that a great misfortune will happen in the course of theyear if the tails are not severed at one blow. The oxen are afterwards killed, and their flesh iseaten by the chiefs. Here the tears of the oxen, like those of the human victims amongst theKhonds and the Aztecs, are probably a rain-charm. We have already seen that the virtue ofthe corn-spirit, embodied in animal form, is sometimes supposed to reside in the tail, and thatthe last handful of corn is sometimes conceived as the tail of the corn-spirit. In the Mithraicreligion this conception is graphically set forth in some of the numerous sculptures which rep-resent Mithras kneeling on the back of a bull and plunging a knife into its flank; for on certainof these monuments the tail of the bull ends in three stalks of corn, and in one of them corn-Page 361"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"stalks instead of blood are seen issuing from the wound inflicted by the knife. Such represen-tations certainly suggest that the bull, whose sacrifice appears to have formed a leading fea-ture in the Mithraic ritual, was conceived, in one at least of its aspects, as an incarnation ofthe corn-spirit.Still more clearly does the ox appear as a personification of the corn-spirit in a ceremonywhich is observed in all the provinces and districts of China to welcome the approach ofspring. On the first day of spring, usually on the third or fourth of February, which is also thebeginning of the Chinese New Year, the governor or prefect of the city goes in procession tothe east gate of the city, and sacrifices to the Divine Husbandman, who is represented with abull’s head on the body of a man. A large effigy of an ox, cow, or buffalo has been preparedfor the occasion, and stands outside of the east gate, with agricultural implements beside it.The figure is made of differently-coloured pieces of paper pasted on a framework either by ablind man or according to the directions of a necromancer. The colours of the paper prognos-ticate the character of the coming year; if red prevails, there will be many fires; if white, therewill be floods and rain; and so with the other colours. The mandarins walk slowly round theox, beating it severely at each step with rods of various hues. It is filled with five kinds ofgrain, which pour forth when the effigy is broken by the blows of the rods. The paper frag-ments are then set on fire, and a scramble takes place for the burning fragments, becausethe people believe that whoever gets one of them is sure to be fortunate throughout the year.Alive buffalo is next killed, and its flesh is divided among the mandarins. According to oneaccount, the effigy of the ox is made of clay, and, after being beaten by the governor, isstoned by the people till they break it in pieces, “from which they expect an abundant year.”Here the corn-spirit appears to be plainly represented by the corn-filled ox, whose fragmentsmay therefore be supposed to bring fertility with them.On the whole we may perhaps conclude that both as a goat and as a bull Dionysus wasessentially a god of vegetation. The Chinese and European customs which I have cited mayperhaps shed light on the custom of rending a live bull or goat at the rites of Dionysus. Theanimal was torn in fragments, as the Khond victim was cut in pieces, in order that the wor-shippers might each secure a portion of the life-giving and fertilising influence of the god. Theflesh was eaten raw as a sacrament, and we may conjecture that some of it was taken hometo be buried in the fields, or otherwise employed so as to convey to the fruits of the earth thequickening influence of the god of vegetation. The resurrection of Dionysus, related in hismyth, may have been enacted in his rites by stuffing and setting up the slain ox, as was doneat the Athenian bouphonia.2. DEMETER, THE PIG AND THE HORSEPassing next to the corn-goddess Demeter, and remembering that in European folk-lore thepig is a common embodiment of the corn-spirit, we may now ask whether the pig, which wasso closely associated with Demeter, may not have been originally the goddess herself in ani-mal form. The pig was sacred to her; in art she was portrayed carrying or accompanied by apig; and the pig was regularly sacrificed in her mysteries, the reason assigned being that thepig injures the corn and is therefore an enemy of the goddess. But after an animal has beenconceived as a god, or a god as an animal, it sometimes happens, as we have seen, that thegod sloughs off his animal form and becomes purely anthropomorphic; and that then the ani-mal, which at first had been slain in the character of the god, comes to be viewed as a victimoffered to the god on the ground of its hostility to the deity; in short, the god is sacrificed tohimself on the ground that he is his own enemy. This happened to Dionysus, and it may havePage 362"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"happened to Demeter also. And in fact the rites of one of her festivals, the Thesmophoria,bear out the view that originally the pig was an embodiment of the corn-goddess herself,either Demeter or her daughter and double Persephone. The Attic Thesmophoria was anautumn festival, celebrated by women alone in October, and appears to have representedwith mourning rites the descent of Persephone (or Demeter) into the lower world, and with joyher return from the dead. Hence the name Descent or Ascent variously applied to the first,and the name Kalligeneia (fair-born) applied to the third day of the festival. Now it was cus-tomary at the Thesmophoria to throw pigs, cakes of dough, and branches of pine-trees into“the chasms of Demeter and Persephone,” which appear to have been sacred caverns orvaults. In these caverns or vaults there were said to be serpents, which guarded the cavernsand consumed most of the flesh of the pigs and dough-cakes which were thrown in.Afterwards—apparently at the next annual festival-the decayed remains of the pigs, thecakes, and the pine-branches were fetched by women called “drawers,” who, after observingrules of ceremonial purity for three days, descended into the caverns, and, frightening awaythe serpents by clapping their hands, brought up the remains and placed them on the altar.Whoever got a piece of the decayed flesh and cakes, and sowed it with the seed-corn in hisfield, was believed to be sure of a good crop. To explain the rude and ancient ritual of the Thesmophoria the following legend was told. Atthe moment when Pluto carried off Persephone, a swineherd called Eubuleus chanced to beherding his swine on the spot, and his herd was engulfed in the chasm down which Plutovanished with Persephone. Accordingly at the Thesmophoria pigs were annually thrown intocaverns to commemorate the disappearance of the swine of Eubuleus. It follows from thisthat the casting of the pigs into the vaults at the Thesmophoria formed part of the dramaticrepresentation of Persephone’s descent into the lower world; and as no image of Persephoneappears to have been thrown in, we may infer that the descent of the pigs was not so muchan accompaniment of her descent as the descent itself, in short, that the pigs werePersephone. Afterwards when Persephone or Demeter (for the two are equivalent) took onhuman form, a reason had to be found for the custom of throwing pigs into caverns at herfestival; and this was done by saying that when Pluto carried off Persephone there happenedto be some swine browsing near, which were swallowed up along with her. The story is obvi-ously a forced and awkward attempt to bridge over the gulf between the old conception of thecorn-spirit as a pig and the new conception of her as an anthropomorphic goddess. A trace ofthe older conception survived in the legend that when the sad mother was searching fortraces of the vanished Persephone, the footprints of the lost one were obliterated by the foot-prints of a pig; originally, we may conjecture, the footprints of the pig were the footprints ofPersephone and of Demeter herself. A consciousness of the intimate connexion of the pigwith the corn lurks in the legend that the swineherd Eubuleus was a brother of Triptolemus, towhom Demeter first imparted the secret of the corn. Indeed, according to one version of thestory, Eubuleus himself received, jointly with his brother Triptolemus, the gift of the corn fromDemeter as a reward for revealing to her the fate of Persephone. Further, it is to be notedthat at the Thesmophoria the women appear to have eaten swine’s flesh. The meal, if I amright, must have been a solemn sacrament or communion, the worshippers partaking of thebody of the god.As thus explained, the Thesmophoria has its analogies in the folk—customs of NorthernEurope which have been already described. Just as at the Thesmophoria—an autumn festivalin honour of the corn-goddess—swine’s flesh was partly eaten, partly kept in caverns till thefollowing year, when it was taken up to be sown with the seed-corn in the fields for the pur-pose of securing a good crop; so in the neighbourhood of Grenoble the goat killed on the har-Page 363"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"vest-field is partly eaten at the harvest-supper, partly pickled and kept till the next harvest; soat Pouilly the ox killed on the harvest-field is partly eaten by the harvesters, partly pickled andkept till the first day of sowing in spring, probably to be then mixed with the seed, or eaten bythe ploughmen, or both; so at Udvarhely the feathers of the cock which is killed in the lastsheaf at harvest are kept till spring, and then sown with the seed on the field; so in Hesseand Meiningen the flesh of pigs is eaten on Ash Wednesday or Candlemas, and the bonesare kept till sowing-time, when they are put into the field sown or mixed with the seed in thebag; so, lastly, the corn from the last sheaf is kept till Christmas, made into the Yule Boar, andafterwards broken and mixed with the seed-corn at sowing in spring. Thus, to put it generally,the corn-spirit is killed in animal form in autumn; part of his flesh is eaten as a sacrament byhis worshippers; and part of it is kept till next sowing-time or harvest as a pledge and securityfor the continuance or renewal of the corn-spirit’s energies.If persons of fastidious taste should object that the Greeks never could have conceivedDemeter and Persephone to be embodied in the form of pigs, it may be answered that in thecave of Phigalia in Arcadia the Black Demeter was portrayed with the head and mane of ahorse on the body of a woman. Between the portraits of a goddess as a pig, and the portraitof her as a woman with a horse’s head, there is little to choose in respect of barbarism. Thelegend told of the Phigalian Demeter indicates that the horse was one of the animal formsassumed in ancient Greece, as in modern Europe, by the cornspirit. It was said that in hersearch for her daughter, Demeter assumed the form of a mare to escape the addresses ofPoseidon, and that, offended at his importunity, she withdrew in dudgeon to a cave not farfrom Phigalia in the highlands of Western Arcadia. There, robed in black, she tarried so longthat the fruits of the earth were perishing, and mankind would have died of famine if Pan hadnot soothed the angry goddess and persuaded her to quit the cave. In memory of this event,the Phigalians set up an image of the Black Demeter in the cave; it represented a womandressed in a long robe, with the head and mane of a horse. The Black Demeter, in whoseabsence the fruits of the earth perish, is plainly a mythical expression for the bare wintry earthstripped of its summer mantle of green.3. ATTIS, ADONIS, AND THE PIGPassing now to Attis and Adonis, we may note a few facts which seem to show that thesedeities of vegetation had also, like other deities of the same class, their animal embodiments.The worshippers of Attis abstained from eating the flesh of swine. This appears to indicatethat the pig was regarded as an embodiment of Attis. And the legend that Attis was killed by aboar points in the same direction. For after the examples of the goat Dionysus and the pigDemeter it may almost be laid down as a rule that an animal which is said to have injured agod was originally the god himself. Perhaps the cry of “Hyes Attes! Hyes Attes!” which wasraised by the worshippers of Attis, may be neither more nor less than “Pig Attis! Pig Attis!”—hyes being possibly a Phrygian form of the Greek hys,— “a pig.”In regard to Adonis, his connexion with the boar was not always explained by the story thathe had been killed by the animal. According to another story, a boar rent with his tusk thebark of the tree in which the infant Adonis was born. According to yet another story, he per-ished at the hands of Hephaestus on Mount Lebanon while he was hunting wild boars. Thesevariations in the legend serve to show that, while the connexion of the boar with Adonis wascertain, the reason of the connexion was not understood, and that consequently different sto-ries were devised to explain it. Certainly the pig ranked as a sacred animal among theSyrians. At the great religious metropolis of Hierapolis on the Euphrates pigs were neitherPage 364"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"sacrificed nor eaten, and if a man touched a pig he was unclean for the rest of the day. Somepeople said this was because the pigs were unclean; others said it was because the pigswere sacred. This difference of opinion points to a hazy state of religious thought in which theideas of sanctity and uncleanness are not yet sharply distinguished, both being blent in a sortof vaporous solution to which we give the name of taboo. It is quite consistent with this thatthe pig should have been held to be an embodiment of the divine Adonis, and the analogiesof Dionysus and Demeter make it probable that the story of the hostility of the animal to thegod was only a late misapprehension of the old view of the god as embodied in a pig. Therule that pigs were not sacrificed or eaten by worshippers of Attis and presumably of Adonis,does not exclude the possibility that in these rituals the pig was slain on solemn occasions asa representative of the god and consumed sacramentally by the worshippers. Indeed, thesacramental killing and eating of an animal implies that the animal is sacred, and that, as ageneral rule, it is spared.The attitude of the Jews to the pig was as ambiguous as that of the heathen Syrians towardsthe same animal. The Greeks could not decide whether the Jews worshipped swine or abomi-nated them. On the one hand they might not eat swine; but on the other hand they might notkill them. And if the former rule speaks for the uncleanness, the latter speaks still morestrongly for the sanctity of the animal. For whereas both rules may, and one rule must, beexplained on the supposition that the pig was sacred; neither rule must, and one rule cannot,be explained on the supposition that the pig was unclean. If, therefore, we prefer the formersupposition, we must conclude that, originally at least, the pig was revered rather thanabhorred by the Israelites. We are confirmed in this opinion by observing that down to thetime of Isaiah some of the Jews used to meet secretly in gardens to eat the flesh of swineand mice as a religious rite. Doubtless this was a very ancient ceremony, dating from a timewhen both the pig and the mouse were venerated as divine, and when their flesh was partak-en of sacramentally on rare and solemn occasions as the body and blood of gods. And ingeneral it may perhaps be said that all so-called unclean animals were originally sacred; thereason for not eating them was that they were divine.4. OSIRIS, THE PIG AND THE BULLIn ancient Egypt, within historical times, the pig occupied the same dubious position as inSyria and Palestine, though at first sight its uncleanness is more prominent than its sanctity.The Egyptians are generally said by Greek writers to have abhorred the pig as a foul andloathsome animal. If a man so much as touched a pig in passing, he stepped into the riverwith all his clothes on, to wash off the taint. To drink pig’s milk was believed to cause leprosyto the drinker. Swineherds, though natives of Egypt, were forbidden to enter any temple, andthey were the only men who were thus excluded. No one would give his daughter in marriageto a swineherd, or marry a swineherd’s daughter; the swineherds married among themselves.Yet once a year the Egyptians sacrificed pigs to the moon and to Osiris, and not only sacri-ficed them, but ate of their flesh, though on any other day of the year they would neither sac-rifice them nor taste of their flesh. Those who were too poor to offer a pig on this day bakedcakes of dough, and offered them instead. This can hardly be explained except by the suppo-sition that the pig was a sacred animal which was eaten sacramentally by his worshippersonce a year.The view that in Egypt the pig was sacred is borne out by the very facts which, to moderns,might seem to prove the contrary. Thus the Egyptians thought, as we have seen, that to drinkpig’s milk produced leprosy. But exactly analogous views are held by savages about the ani-Page 365"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"mals and plants which they deem most sacred. Thus in the island of Wetar (between NewGuinea and Celebes) people believe themselves to be variously descended from wild pigs,serpents, crocodiles, turtles, dogs, and eels; a man may not eat an animal of the kind fromwhich he is descended; if he does so, he will become a leper, and go mad. Amongst theOmaha Indians of North America men whose totem is the elk, believe that if they ate the fleshof the male elk they would break out in boils and white spots in different parts of their bodies.In the same tribe men whose totem is the red maize, think that if they ate red maize theywould have running sores all round their mouths. The Bush negroes of Surinam, who practisetotemism, believe that if they ate the capiaï (an animal like a pig) it would give them leprosy;perhaps the capiaï is one of their totems. The Syrians, in antiquity, who esteemed fish sacred,thought that if they ate fish their bodies would break out in ulcers, and their feet and stomachwould swell up. The Chasas of Orissa believe that if they were to injure their totemic animalthey would be attacked by leprosy and their line would die out. These examples prove thatthe eating of a sacred animal is often believed to produce leprosy or other skin-diseases; sofar, therefore, they support the view that the pig must have been sacred in Egypt, since theeffect of drinking its milk was believed to be leprosy.Again, the rule that, after touching a pig, a man had to wash himself and his clothes, alsofavours the view of the sanctity of the pig. For it is a common belief that the effect of contactwith a sacred object must be removed, by washing or otherwise, before a man is free to min-gle with his fellows. Thus the Jews wash their hands after reading the sacred scriptures.Before coming forth from the tabernacle after the sin-offering, the high priest had to washhimself, and put off the garments which he had worn in the holy place. It was a rule of Greekritual that, in offering an expiatory sacrifice, the sacrificer should not touch the sacrifice, andthat, after the offering was made, he must wash his body and his clothes in a river or springbefore he could enter a city or his own house. The Polynesians felt strongly the need of rid-ding themselves of the sacred contagion, if it may be so called, which they caught by touch-ing sacred objects. Various ceremonies were performed for the purpose of removing this con-tagion. We have seen, for example, how in Tonga a man who happened to touch a sacredchief, or anything personally belonging to him, had to perform a certain ceremony before hecould feed himself with his hands; otherwise it was believed that he would swell up and die,or at least be afflicted with scrofula or some other disease. We have seen, too, what fataleffects are supposed to follow, and do actually follow, from contact with a sacred object inNew Zealand. In short, primitive man believes that what is sacred is dangerous; it is pervadedby a sort of electrical sanctity which communicates a shock to, even if it does not kill, whatev-er comes in contact with it. Hence the savage is unwilling to touch or even to see that whichhe deems peculiarly holy. Thus Bechuanas, of the Crocodile clan, think it “hateful andunlucky” to meet or see a crocodile; the sight is thought to cause inflammation of the eyes.Yet the crocodile is their most sacred object; they call it their father, swear by it, and celebrateit in their festivals. The goat is the sacred animal of the Madenassana Bushmen; yet “to lookupon it would be to render the man for the time impure, as well as to cause him undefineduneasiness.” The Elk clan, among the Omaha Indians, believe that even to touch the male elkwould be followed by an eruption of boils and white spots on the body. Members of theReptile clan in the same tribe think that if one of them touches or smells a snake, it will makehis hair white. In Samoa people whose god was a butterfly believed that if they caught a but-terfly it would strike them dead. Again, in Samoa the reddish-seared leaves of the banana-tree were commonly used as plates for handing food; but if any member of the Wild Pigeonfamily had used banana leaves for this purpose, it was supposed that he would suffer fromrheumatic swellings or an eruption all over the body like chicken-pox. The Mori clan of theBhils in Central India worship the peacock as their totem and make offerings of grain to it; yetPage 366"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"members of the clan believe that were they even to set foot on the tracks of a peacock theywould afterwards suffer from some disease, and if a woman sees a peacock she must veilher face and look away. Thus the primitive mind seems to conceive of holiness as a sort ofdangerous virus, which a prudent man will shun as far as possible, and of which, if he shouldchance to be infected by it, he will carefully disinfect himself by some form of ceremonialpurification.In the light of these parallels the beliefs and customs of the Egyptians touching the pig areprobably to be explained as based upon an opinion of the extreme sanctity rather than of theextreme uncleanness of the animal; or rather, to put it more correctly, they imply that the ani-mal was looked on, not simply as a filthy and disgusting creature, but as a being endowedwith high supernatural powers, and that as such it was regarded with that primitive sentimentof religious awe and fear in which the feelings of reverence and abhorrence are almost equal-ly blended. The ancients themselves seem to have been aware that there was another side tothe horror with which swine seemed to inspire the Egyptians. For the Greek astronomer andmathematician Eudoxus, who resided fourteen months in Egypt and conversed with thepriests, was of opinion that the Egyptians spared the pig, not out of abhorrence, but from aregard to its utility in agriculture; for, according to him, when the Nile had subsided, herds ofswine were turned loose over the fields to tread the seed down into the moist earth. But whena being is thus the object of mixed and implicitly contradictory feelings, he may be said tooccupy a position of unstable equilibrium. In course of time one of the contradictory feelings islikely to prevail over the other, and according as the feeling which finally predominates is thatof reverence or abhorrence, the being who is the object of it will rise into a god or sink into adevil. The latter, on the whole, was the fate of the pig in Egypt. For in historical times the fearand horror of the pig seem certainly to have outweighed the reverence and worship of whichhe may once have been the object, and of which, even in his fallen state, he never quite losttrace. He came to be looked on as an embodiment of Set or Typhon, the Egyptian devil andenemy of Osiris. For it was in the shape of a black pig that Typhon injured the eye of the godHorus, who burned him and instituted the sacrifice of the pig, the sun-god Ra having declaredthe beast abominable. Again, the story that Typhon was hunting a boar when he discoveredand mangled the body of Osiris, and that this was the reason why pigs were sacrificed once ayear, is clearly a modernised version of an older story that Osiris, like Adonis and Attis, wasslain or mangled by a boar, or by Typhon in the form of a boar. Thus, the annual sacrifice of apig to Osiris might naturally be interpreted as vengeance inflicted on the hostile animal thathad slain or mangled the god. But, in the first place, when an animal is thus killed as asolemn sacrifice once and once only in the year, it generally or always means that the animalis divine, that he is spared and respected the rest of the year as a god and slain, when he isslain, also in the character of a god. In the second place, the examples of Dionysus andDemeter, if not of Attis and Adonis, have taught us that the animal which is sacrificed to a godon the ground that he is the god’s enemy may have been, and probably was, originally thegod himself. Therefore, the annual sacrifice of a pig to Osiris, coupled with the alleged hostili-ty of the animal to the god, tends to show, first, that originally the pig was a god, and, second,that he was Osiris. At a later age, when Osiris became anthropomorphic and his original rela-tion to the pig had been forgotten, the animal was first distinguished from him, and afterwardsopposed as an enemy to him by mythologists who could think of no reason for killing a beastin connexion with the worship of a god except that the beast was the god’s enemy; or, asPlutarch puts it, not that which is dear to the gods, but that which is the contrary, is fit to besacrificed. At this later stage the havoc which a wild boar notoriously makes amongst the cornwould supply a plausible reason for regarding him as the foe of the corn-spirit, though origi-nally, if I am right, the very freedom with which the boar ranged at will through the corn ledPage 367"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"people to identify him with the corn-spirit, to whom he was afterwards opposed as an enemy.The view which identifies the pig with Osiris derives not a little support from the sacrifice ofpigs to him on the very day on which, according to tradition, Osiris himself was killed; for thusthe killing of the pig was the annual representation of the killing of Osiris, just as the throwingof the pigs into the caverns at the Thesmophoria was an annual representation of the descentof Persephone into the lower world; and both customs are parallel to the European practice ofkilling a goat, cock, and so forth, at harvest as a representative of the corn-spirit.Again, the theory that the pig, originally Osiris himself, afterwards came to be regarded as anembodiment of his enemy Typhon, is supported by the similar relation of red-haired men andred oxen to Typhon. For in regard to the red-haired men who were burned and whose asheswere scattered with winnowing-fans, we have seen fair grounds for believing that originally,like the red-haired puppies killed at Rome in spring, they were representatives of the corn-spirit himself that is, of Osiris, and were slain for the express purpose of making the corn turnred or golden. Yet at a later time these men were explained to be representatives, not ofOsiris, but of his enemy Typhon, and the killing of them was regarded as an act of vengeanceinflicted on the enemy of the god. Similarly, the red oxen sacrificed by the Egyptians weresaid to be offered on the ground of their resemblance to Typhon; though it is more likely thatoriginally they were slain on the ground of their resemblance to the corn-spirit Osiris. Wehave seen that the ox is a common representative of the corn-spirit and is slain as such onthe harvest-field.Osiris was regularly identified with the bull Apis of Memphis and the bull Mnevis of Heliopolis.But it is hard to say whether these bulls were embodiments of him as the corn-spirit, as thered oxen appear to have been, or whether they were not in origin entirely distinct deities whocame to be fused with Osiris at a later time. The universality of the worship of these two bullsseems to put them on a different footing from the ordinary sacred animals whose worshipswere purely local. But whatever the original relation of Apis to Osiris may have been, there isone fact about the former which ought not to be passed over in a disquisition on the customof killing a god. Although the bull Apis was worshipped as a god with much pomp and pro-found reverence, he was not suffered to live beyond a certain length of time which was pre-scribed by the sacred books, and on the expiry of which he was drowned in a holy spring.The limit, according to Plutarch, was twenty-five years; but it cannot always have beenenforced, for the tombs of the Apis bulls have been discovered in modern times, and from theinscriptions on them it appears that in the twenty-second dynasty two of the holy steers livedmore than twenty-six years.5. VIRBIUS AND THE HORSEWe are now in a position to hazard a conjecture as to the meaning of the tradition thatVirbius, the first of the divine Kings of the Wood at Aricia, had been killed in the character ofHippolytus by horses. Having found, first, that spirits of the corn are not infrequently repre-sented in the form of horses; and, second, that the animal which in later legends is said tohave injured the god was sometimes originally the god himself, we may conjecture that thehorses by which Virbius or Hippolytus was said to have been slain were really embodimentsof him as a deity of vegetation. The myth that he had been killed by horses was probablyinvented to explain certain features in his worship, amongst others the custom of excludinghorses from his sacred grove. For myth changes while custom remains constant; men contin-ue to do what their fathers did before them, though the reasons on which their fathers actedPage 368"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"have been long forgotten. The history of religion is a long attempt to reconcile old custom withnew reason, to find a sound theory for an absurd practice. In the case before us we may besure that the myth is more modern than the custom and by no means represents the originalreason for excluding horses from the grove. From their exclusion it might be inferred thathorses could not be the sacred animals or embodiments of the god of the grove. But theinference would be rash. The goat was at one time a sacred animal or embodiment ofAthena, as may be inferred from the practice of representing the goddess clad in a goat-skin(aegis). Yet the goat was neither sacrificed to her as a rule, nor allowed to enter her greatsanctuary, the Acropolis at Athens. The reason alleged for this was that the goat injured theolive, the sacred tree of Athena. So far, therefore, the relation of the goat to Athena is parallelto the relation of the horse to Virbius, both animals being excluded from the sanctuary on theground of injury done by them to the god. But from Varro we learn that there was an excep-tion to the rule which excluded the goat from the Acropolis. Once a year, he says, the goatwas driven on to the Acropolis for a necessary sacrifice. Now, as has been remarked before,when an animal is sacrificed once and once only in the year, it is probably slain, not as a vic-tim offered to the god, but as a representative of the god himself. Therefore we may infer thatif a goat was sacrificed on the Acropolis once a year, it was sacrificed in the character ofAthena herself; and it may be conjectured that the skin of the sacrificed animal was placed onthe statue of the goddess and formed the aegis, which would thus be renewed annually.Similarly at Thebes in Egypt rams were sacred and were not sacrificed. But on one day in theyear a ram was killed, and its skin was placed on the statue of the god Ammon. Now, if weknew the ritual of the Arician grove better, we might find that the rule of excluding horses fromit, like the rule of excluding goats from the Acropolis at Athens, was subject to an annualexception, a horse being once a year taken into the grove and sacrificed as an embodimentof the god Virbius. By the usual misunderstanding the horse thus killed would come in time tobe regarded as an enemy offered up in sacrifice to the god whom he had injured, like the pigwhich was sacrificed to Demeter and Osiris or the goat which was sacrificed to Dionysus, andpossibly to Athena. It is so easy for a writer to record a rule without noticing an exception thatwe need not wonder at finding the rule of the Arician grove recorded without any mention ofan exception such as I suppose. If we had had only the statements of Athenaeus and Pliny,we should have known only the rule which forbade the sacrifice of goats to Athena andexcluded them from the Acropolis, without being aware of the important exception which thefortunate preservation of Varro’s work has revealed to us.The conjecture that once a year a horse may have been sacrificed in the Arician grove as arepresentative of the deity of the grove derives some support from the similar sacrifice of ahorse which took place once a year at Rome. On the fifteenth of October in each year a char-iot-race was run on the Field of Mars. Stabbed with a spear, the right-hand horse of the victo-rious team was then sacrificed to Mars for the purpose of ensuring good crops, and its headwas cut off and adorned with a string of loaves. Thereupon the inhabitants of two wards—theSacred Way and the Subura—contended with each other who should get the head. If thepeople of the Sacred Way got it, they fastened it to a wall of the king’s house; if the people ofthe Subura got it, they fastened it to the Mamilian tower. The horse’s tail was cut off and car-ried to the king’s house with such speed that the blood dripped on the hearth of the house.Further, it appears that the blood of the horse was caught and preserved till the twenty-first ofApril, when the Vestal Virgins mixed it with the blood of the unborn calves which had beensacrificed six days before. The mixture was then distributed to shepherds, and used by themfor fumigating their flocks.In this ceremony the decoration of the horse’s head with a string of loaves, and the allegedPage 369"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"object of the sacrifice, namely, to procure a good harvest, seem to indicate that the horse waskilled as one of those animal representatives of the corn-spirit of which we have found somany examples. The custom of cutting off the horse’s tail is like the African custom of cuttingoff the tails of the oxen and sacrificing them to obtain a good crop. In both the Roman and theAfrican custom the animal apparently stands for the corn-spirit, and its fructifying power issupposed to reside especially in its tail. The latter idea occurs, as we have seen, in Europeanfolk-lore. Again, the practice of fumigating the cattle in spring with the blood of the horse maybe compared with the practice of giving the Old Wife, the Maiden, or the clyack sheaf as fod-der to the horses in spring or the cattle at Christmas, and giving the Yule Boar to the plough-ing oxen or horses to eat in spring. All these usages aim at ensuring the blessing of the corn-spirit on the homestead and its inmates and storing it up for another year.The Roman sacrifice of the October horse, as it was called, carries us back to the early dayswhen the Subura, afterwards a low and squalid quarter of the great metropolis, was still aseparate village, whose inhabitants engaged in a friendly contest on the harvest-field withtheir neighbours of Rome, then a little rural town. The Field of Mars on which the ceremonytook place lay beside the Tiber, and formed part of the king’s domain down to the abolition ofthe monarchy. For tradition ran that at the time when the last of the kings was driven fromRome, the corn stood ripe for the sickle on the crown lands beside the river; but no onewould eat the accursed grain and it was flung into the river in such heaps that, the waterbeing low with the summer heat, it formed the nucleus of an island. The horse sacrifice wasthus an old autumn custom observed upon the king’s corn-fields at the end of the harvest.The tail and blood of the horse, as the chief parts of the corn-spirit’s representative, weretaken to the king’s house and kept there; just as in Germany the harvest-cock is nailed on thegable or over the door of the farmhouse; and as the last sheaf, in the form of the Maiden, iscarried home and kept over the fireplace in the Highlands of Scotland. Thus the blessing ofthe corn-spirit was brought to the king’s house and hearth and, through them, to the commu-nity of which he was the head. Similarly in the spring and autumn customs of NorthernEurope the May-pole is sometimes set up in front of the house of the mayor or burgomaster,and the last sheaf at harvest is brought to him as the head of the village. But while the tailand blood fell to the king, the neighbouring village of the Subura, which no doubt once had asimilar ceremony of its own, was gratified by being allowed to compete for the prize of thehorse’s head. The Mamilian tower, to which the Suburans nailed the horse’s head when theysucceeded in carrying it off, appears to have been a peel-tower or keep of the old Mamilianfamily, the magnates of the village. The ceremony thus performed on the king’s fields and athis house on behalf of the whole town and of the neighbouring village presupposes a timewhen each township performed a similar ceremony on its own fields. In the rural districts ofLatium the villages may have continued to observe the custom, each on its own land, longafter the Roman hamlets had merged their separate harvest-homes in the common celebra-tion on the king’s lands. There is no intrinsic improbability in the supposition that the sacredgrove of Aricia, like the Field of Mars at Rome, may have been the scene of a common har-vest celebration, at which a horse was sacrificed with the same rude rites on behalf of theneighbouring villages. The horse would represent the fructifying spirit both of the tree and ofthe corn, for the two ideas melt into each other, as we see in customs like the Harvest-May.Chapter LEating the God1. THE SACRAMENTS OF FIRST-FRUITSPage 370"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"WE have now seen that the corn-spirit is represented sometimes in human, sometimes in ani-mal form, and that in both cases he is killed in the person of his representative and eatensacramentally. To find examples of actually killing the human representative of the corn-spiritwe had naturally to go to savage races; but the harvest-suppers of our European peasantshave furnished unmistakable examples of the sacramental eating of animals as representa-tives of the corn-spirit. But further, as might have been anticipated, the new corn is itselfeaten sacramentally, that is, as the body of the corn-spirit. In Wermland, Sweden, thefarmer’s wife uses the grain of the last sheaf to bake a loaf in the shape of a little girl; this loafis divided amongst the whole household and eaten by them. Here the loaf represents thecorn-spirit conceived as a maiden; just as in Scotland the corn-spirit is similarly conceivedand represented by the last sheaf made up in the form of a woman and bearing the name ofthe Maiden. As usual, the corn-spirit is believed to reside in the last sheaf; and to eat a loafmade from the last sheaf is, therefore, to eat the corn-spirit itself. Similarly at La Palisse, inFrance, a man made of dough is hung upon the fir-tree which is carried on the last harvest-waggon. The tree and the dough-man are taken to the mayor’s house and kept there till thevintage is over. Then the close of the harvest is celebrated by a feast at which the mayorbreaks the dough-man in pieces and gives the pieces to the people to eat.In these examples the corn-spirit is represented and eaten in human shape. In other cases,though the new corn is not baked in loaves of human shape, still the solemn ceremonies withwhich it is eaten suffice to indicate that it is partaken of sacramentally, that is, as the body ofthe corn-spirit. For example, the following ceremonies used to be observed by Lithuanianpeasants at eating the new corn. About the time of the autumn sowing, when all the corn hadbeen got in and the threshing had begun, each farmer held a festival called Sabarios, that is,“the mixing or throwing together.” He took nine good handfuls of each kind of crop—wheat,barley, oats, flax, beans, lentils, and the rest; and each handful he divided into three parts.The twentyseven portions of each grain were then thrown on a heap and all mixed up togeth-er. The grain used had to be that which was first threshed and winnowed and which had beenset aside and kept for this purpose. A part of the grain thus mixed was employed to bake littleloaves, one for each of the household; the rest was mixed with more barley or oats and madeinto beer. The first beer brewed from this mixture was for the drinking of the farmer, his wife,and children; the second brew was for the servants. The beer being ready, the farmer chosean evening when no stranger was expected. Then he knelt down before the barrel of beer,drew a jugful of the liquor and poured it on the bung of the barrel, saying, “O fruitful earth,make rye and barley and all kinds of corn to flourish.” Next he took the jug to the parlour,where his wife and children awaited him. On the floor of the parlour lay bound a black orwhite or speckled (not a red) cock and a hen of the same colour and of the same brood,which must have been hatched within the year. Then the farmer knelt down, with the jug inhis hand, and thanked God for the harvest and prayed for a good crop next year. Next all lift-ed up their hands and said, “O God, and thou, O earth, we give you this cock and hen as afree-will offering.” With that the farmer killed the fowls with the blows of a wooden spoon, forhe might not cut their heads off. After the first prayer and after killing each of the birds hepoured out a third of the beer. Then his wife boiled the fowls in a new pot which had neverbeen used before. After that, a bushel was set, bottom upwards, on the floor, and on it wereplaced the little loaves mentioned above and the boiled fowls. Next the new beer wasfetched, together with a ladle and three mugs, none of which was used except on this occa-sion. When the farmer had ladled the beer into the mugs, the family knelt down round thebushel. The father then uttered a prayer and drank off the three mugs of beer. The rest fol-lowed his example. Then the loaves and the flesh of the fowls were eaten, after which thebeer went round again, till every one had emptied each of the three mugs nine times. None ofPage 371"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"the food should remain over; but if anything did happen to be left, it was consumed nextmorning with the same ceremonies. The bones were given to the dog to eat; if he did not eatthem all up, the remains were buried under the dung in the cattle-stall. This ceremony wasobserved at the beginning of December. On the day on which it took place no bad word mightbe spoken.Such was the custom about two hundred years or more ago. At the present day in Lithuania,when new potatoes or loaves made from the new corn are being eaten, all the people at tablepull each other’s hair. The meaning of this last custom is obscure, but a similar custom wascertainly observed by the heathen Lithuanians at their solemn sacrifices. Many of theEsthonians of the island of Oesel will not eat bread baked of the new corn till they have firsttaken a bite at a piece of iron. The iron is here plainly a charm, intended to render harmlessthe spirit that is in the corn. In Sutherlandshire at the present day, when the new potatoes aredug all the family must taste them, otherwise “the spirits in them [the potatoes] take offence,and the potatoes would not keep.” In one part of Yorkshire it is still customary for the clergy-man to cut the first corn; and my informant believes that the corn so cut is used to make thecommunion bread. If the latter part of the custom is correctly reported (and analogy is all in itsfavour), it shows how the Christian communion has absorbed within itself a sacrament whichis doubtless far older than Christianity.The Aino or Ainu of Japan are said to distinguish various kinds of millet as male and femalerespectively, and these kinds, taken together, are called “the divine husband and wife cereal”(Umurek haru kamui). “Therefore before millet is pounded and made into cakes for generaleating, the old men have a few made for themselves first to worship. When they are readythey pray to them very earnestly and say: ‘O thou cereal deity, we worship thee. Thou hastgrown very well this year, and thy flavour will be sweet. Thou art good. The goddess of firewill be glad, and we also shall rejoice greatly. O thou god, O thou divine cereal, do thou nour-ish the people. I now partake of thee. I worship thee and give thee thanks.’ After having thusprayed, they, the worshippers, take a cake and eat it, and from this time the people may allpartake of the new millet. And so with many gestures of homage and words of prayer thiskind of food is dedicated to the well-being of the Ainu. No doubt the cereal offering is regard-ed as a tribute paid to a god, but that god is no other than the seed itself; and it is only a godin so far as it is beneficial to the human body.”At the close of the rice harvest in the East Indian island of Buru, each clan meets at a com-mon sacramental meal, to which every member of the clan is bound to contribute a little ofthe new rice. This meal is called “eating the soul of the rice,” a name which clearly indicatesthe sacramental character of the repast. Some of the rice is also set apart and offered to thespirits. Amongst the Alfoors of Minahassa, in Celebes, the priest sows the first rice-seed andplucks the first ripe rice in each field. This rice he roasts and grinds into meal, and givessome of it to each of the household. Shortly before the rice-harvest in Boland Mongondo,another district of Celebes, an offering is made of a small pig or a fowl. Then the priest plucksa little rice, first on his own field and next on those of his neighbours. All the rice thus pluckedby him he dries along with his own, and then gives it back to the respective owners, whohave it ground and boiled. When it is boiled the women take it back, with an egg, to thepriest, who offers the egg in sacrifice and returns the rice to the women. Of this rice everymember of the family, down to the youngest child, must partake. After this ceremony everyone is free to get in his rice.Amongst the Burghers or Badagas, a tribe of the Neilgherry Hills in Southern India, the firstPage 372"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"handful of seed is sown and the first sheaf reaped by a Curumbar, a man of a different tribe,the members of which the Burghers regard as sorcerers. The grain contained in the firstsheaf “is that day reduced to meal, made into cakes, and, being offered as a first-fruit obla-tion, is, together with the remainder of the sacrificed animal, partaken of by the Burgher andthe whole of his family, as the meat of a federal offering and sacrifice.” Among the Hindoos ofSouthern India the eating of the new rice is the occasion of a family festival called Pongol.The new rice is boiled in a new pot on a fire which is kindled at noon on the day when,according to Hindoo astrologers, the sun enters the tropic of Capricorn. The boiling of the potis watched with great anxiety by the whole family, for as the milk boils, so will the coming yearbe. If the milk boils rapidly, the year will be prosperous; but it will be the reverse if the milkboils slowly. Some of the new boiled rice is offered to the image of Ganesa; then every onepartakes of it. In some parts of Northern India the festival of the new crop is known as Navan,that is, “new grain.” When the crop is ripe, the owner takes the omens, goes to the field,plucks five or six ears of barley in the spring crop and one of the millets in the autumn har-vest. This is brought home, parched, and mixed with coarse sugar, butter, and curds. Some ofit is thrown on the fire in the name of the village gods and deceased ancestors; the rest iseaten by the family.The ceremony of eating the new yams at Onitsha, on the Niger, is thus described: “Eachheadman brought out six yams, and cut down young branches of palm-leaves and placedthem before his gate, roasted three of the yams, and got some kola-nuts and fish. After theyam is roasted, the Libia, or country doctor, takes the yam, scrapes it into a sort of meal, anddivides it into halves; he then takes one piece, and places it on the lips of the person who isgoing to eat the new yam. The eater then blows up the steam from the hot yam, and after-wards pokes the whole into his mouth, and says, ‘I thank God for being permitted to eat thenew yam’; he then begins to chew it heartily, with fish likewise.”Among the Nandi of British East Africa, when the eleusine grain is ripening in autumn, everywoman who owns a corn-field goes out into it with her daughters, and they all pluck some ofthe ripe grain. Each of the women then fixes one grain in her necklace and chews another,which she rubs on her forehead, throat, and breast. No mark of joy escapes them; sorrowfullythey cut a basketful of the new corn, and carrying it home place it in the loft to dry. As theceiling is of wickerwork, a good deal of the grain drops through the crevices and falls into thefire, where it explodes with a crackling noise. The people make no attempt to prevent thiswaste; for they regard the crackling of the grain in the fire as a sign that the souls of the deadare partaking of it. A few days later porridge is made from the new grain and served up withmilk at the evening meal. All the members of the family take some of the porridge and dab iton the walls and roofs of the huts; also they put a little in their mouths and spit it out towardsthe east and on the outside of the huts. Then, holding up some of the grain in his hand, thehead of the family prays to God for health and strength, and likewise for milk, and everybodypresent repeats the words of the prayer after him.Amongst the Caffres of Natal and Zululand, no one may eat of the new fruits till after a festi-val which marks the beginning of the Caffre year and falls at the end of December or thebeginning of January. All the people assemble at the king’s kraal, where they feast anddance. Before they separate the “dedication of the people” takes place. Various fruits of theearth, as corn, mealies, and pumpkins, mixed with the flesh of a sacrificed animal and with“medicine,” are boiled in great pots, and a little of this food is placed in each man’s mouth bythe king himself. After thus partaking of the sanctified fruits, a man is himself sanctified for thewhole year, and may immediately get in his crops. It is believed that if any man were to par-Page 373"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"take of the new fruits before the festival, he would die; if he were detected, he would be put todeath, or at least all his cattle would be taken from him. The holiness of the new fruits is wellmarked by the rule that they must be cooked in a special pot which is used only for this pur-pose, and on a new fire kindled by a magician through the friction of two sticks which arecalled “husband and wife.”Among the Bechuanas it is a rule that before they partake of the new crops they must purifythemselves. The purification takes place at the commencement of the new year on a day inJanuary which is fixed by the chief. It begins in the great kraal of the tribe, where all the adultmales assemble. Each of them takes in his hand leaves of a gourd called by the nativeslerotse (described as something between a pumpkin and a vegetable marrow); and havingcrushed the leaves he anoints with the expressed juice his big toes and his navel; many peo-ple indeed apply the juice to all the joints of their body, but the better-informed say that this isa vulgar departure from ancient custom. After this ceremony in the great kraal every mangoes home to his own kraal, assembles all the members of his family, men, women, and chil-dren, and smears them all with the juice of the lerotse leaves. Some of the leaves are alsopounded, mixed with milk in a large wooden dish, and given to the dogs to lap up. Then theporridge plate of each member of the family is rubbed with the lerotse leaves. When thispurification has been completed, but not before, the people are free to eat of the new crops.The Bororo Indians of Brazil think that it would be certain death to eat the new maize before ithas been blessed by the medicine-man. The ceremony of blessing it is as follows. The half-ripe husk is washed and placed before the medicine-man, who by dancing and singing forseveral hours, and by incessant smoking, works himself up into a state of ecstasy, whereuponhe bites into the husk, trembling in every limb and uttering shrieks from time to time. A similarceremony is performed whenever a large animal or a large fish is killed. The Bororo are firmlypersuaded that were any man to touch unconsecrated maize or meat, before the ceremonyhad been completed, he and his whole tribe would perish.Amongst the Creek Indians of North America, the busk or festival of first-fruits was the chiefceremony of the year. It was held in July or August, when the corn was ripe, and marked theend of the old year and the beginning of the new one. Before it took place, none of theIndians would eat or even handle any part of the new harvest. Sometimes each town had itsown busk; sometimes several towns united to hold one in common. Before celebrating thebusk, the people provided themselves with new clothes and new household utensils and fur-niture; they collected their old clothes and rubbish, together with all the remaining grain andother old provisions, cast them together in one common heap, and consumed them with fire.As a preparation for the ceremony, all the fires in the village were extinguished, and theashes swept clean away. In particular, the hearth or altar of the temple was dug up and theashes carried out. Then the chief priest put some roots of the button-snake plant, with somegreen tobacco leaves and a little of the new fruits, at the bottom of the fireplace, which heafterwards commanded to be covered up with white clay, and wetted over with clean water. Athick arbour of green branches of young trees was then made over the altar. Meanwhile thewomen at home were cleaning out their houses, renewing the old hearths, and scouring allthe cooking vessels that they might be ready to receive the new fire and the new fruits. Thepublic or sacred square was carefully swept of even the smallest crumbs of previous feasts,“for fear of polluting the first-fruit offerings.” Also every vessel that had contained or had beenused about any food during the expiring year was removed from the temple before sunset.Then all the men who were not known to have violated the law of the first-fruit offering andthat of marriage during the year were summoned by a crier to enter the holy square andPage 374"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"observe a solemn fast. But the women (except six old ones), the children, and all who hadnot attained the rank of warriors were forbidden to enter the square. Sentinels were also post-ed at the corners of the square to keep out all persons deemed impure and all animals. Astrict fast was then observed for two nights and a day, the devotees drinking a bitter decoc-tion of button-snake root “in order to vomit and purge their sinful bodies.” That the people out-side the square might also be purified, one of the old men laid down a quantity of greentobacco at a corner of the square; this was carried off by an old woman and distributed to thepeople without, who chewed and swallowed it “in order to afflict their souls.” During this gen-eral fast, the women, children, and men of weak constitution were allowed to eat after mid-day, but not before. On the morning when the fast ended, the women brought a quantity ofthe old year’s food to the outside of the sacred square. These provisions were then fetched inand set before the famished multitude, but all traces of them had to be removed before noon.When the sun was declining from the meridian, all the people were commanded by the voiceof a crier to stay within doors, to do no bad act, and to be sure to extinguish and throw awayevery spark of the old fire. Universal silence now reigned. Then the high priest made the newfire by the friction of two pieces of wood, and placed it on the altar under the green arbour.This new fire was believed to atone for all past crimes except murder. Next a basket of newfruits was brought; the high priest took out a little of each sort of fruit, rubbed it with bear’s oil,and offered it, together with some flesh, “to the bountiful holy spirit of fire, as a first-fruit offer-ing, and an annual oblation for sin.” He also consecrated the sacred emetics (the button-snake root and the cassina or black-drink) by pouring a little of them into the fire. The personswho had remained outside now approached, without entering, the sacred square; and thechief priest thereupon made a speech, exhorting the people to observe their old rites and cus-toms, announcing that the new divine fire had purged away the sins of the past year, andearnestly warning the women that, if any of them had not extinguished the old fire, or hadcontracted any impurity, they must forthwith depart, “lest the divine fire should spoil both themand the people.” Some of the new fire was then set down outside the holy square; the womencarried it home joyfully, and laid it on their unpolluted hearths. When several towns had unitedto celebrate the festival, the new fire might thus be carried for several miles. The new fruitswere then dressed on the new fires and eaten with bear’s oil, which was deemed indispensa-ble. At one point of the festival the men rubbed the new corn between their hands, then ontheir faces and breasts. During the festival which followed, the warriors, dressed in their wildmartial array, their heads covered with white down and carrying white feathers in their hands,danced round the sacred arbour, under which burned the new fire. The ceremonies lastedeight days, during which the strictest continence was practised. Towards the conclusion of thefestival the warriors fought a mock battle; then the men and women together, in three circles,danced round the sacred fire. Lastly, all the people smeared themselves with white clay andbathed in running water. They came out of the water believing that no evil could now befallthem for what they had done amiss in the past. So they departed in joy and peace.To this day, also, the remnant of the Seminole Indians of Florida, a people of the same stockas the Creeks, hold an annual purification and festival called the Green Corn Dance, at whichthe new corn is eaten. On the evening of the first day of the festival they quaff a nauseous“Black Drink,” as it is called, which acts both as an emetic and a purgative; they believe thathe who does not drink of this liquor cannot safely eat the new green corn, and besides thathe will be sick at some time in the year. While the liquor is being drunk, the dancing begins,and the medicine-men join in it. Next day they eat of the green corn; the following day theyfast, probably from fear of polluting the sacred food in their stomachs by contact with commonfood; but the third day they hold a great feast.Page 375"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"Even tribes which do not till the ground sometimes observe analogous ceremonies when theygather the first wild fruits or dig the first roots of the season. Thus among the Salish andTinneh Indians of North-West America, “before the young people eat the first berries or rootsof the season, they always addressed the fruit or plant, and begged for its favour and aid. Insome tribes regular First-fruit ceremonies were annually held at the time of picking the wildfruit or gathering the roots, and also among the salmon-eating tribes when the run of the‘sockeye’ salmon began. These ceremonies were not so much thanksgivings, as performanc-es to ensure a plentiful crop or supply of the particular object desired, for if they were notproperly and reverently carried out there was danger of giving offence to the ‘spirits’ of theobjects, and being deprived of them.” For example, these Indians are fond of the youngshoots or suckers of the wild raspberry, and they observe a solemn ceremony at eating thefirst of them in season. The shoots are cooked in a new pot: the people assemble and standin a great circle with closed eyes, while the presiding chief or medicine-man invokes the spiritof the plant, begging that it will be propitious to them and grant them a good supply of suck-ers. After this part of the ceremony is over the cooked suckers are handed to the presidingofficer in a newly carved dish, and a small portion is given to each person present, who rever-ently and decorously eats it.The Thompson Indians of British Columbia cook and eat the sunflower root (Balsamorrhizasagittata, Nutt.), but they used to regard it as a mysterious being, and observed a number oftaboos in connexion with it; for example, women who were engaged in digging or cooking theroot must practice continence, and no man might come near the oven where the women werebaking the root. When young people ate the first berries, roots, or other products of the sea-son, they addressed a prayer to the Sunflower-Root as follows: “I inform thee that I intend toeat thee. Mayest thou always help me to ascend, so that I may always be able to reach thetops of mountains, and may I never be clumsy! I ask this from thee, Sunflower-Root. Thou artthe greatest of all in mystery.” To omit this prayer would make the eater lazy and cause him tosleep long in the morning.These customs of the Thompson and other Indian tribes of North-West America are instruc-tive, because they clearly indicate the motive, or at least one of the motives, which underliesthe ceremonies observed at eating the first fruits of the season. That motive in the case ofthese Indians is simply a belief that the plant itself is animated by a conscious and more orless powerful spirit, who must be propitiated before the people can safely partake of the fruitsor roots which are supposed to be part of his body. Now if this is true of wild fruits and roots,we may infer with some probability that it is also true of cultivated fruits and roots, such asyams, and in particular that it holds good of the cereals, such as wheat, barley, oats, rice, andmaize. In all cases it seems reasonable to infer that the scruples which savages manifest ateating the first fruits of any crop, and the ceremonies which they observe before they over-come their scruples, are due at least in large measure to a notion that the plant or tree is ani-mated by a spirit or even a deity, whose leave must be obtained, or whose favour must besought, before it is possible to partake with safety of the new crop. This indeed is plainlyaffirmed of the Aino: they call the millet “the divine cereal,” “the cereal deity,” and they pray toand worship him before they will eat of the cakes made from the new millet. And even wherethe indwelling divinity of the first fruits is not expressly affirmed, it appears to be implied bothby the solemn preparations made for eating them and by the danger supposed to be incurredby persons who venture to partake of them without observing the prescribed ritual. In all suchcases, accordingly, we may not improperly describe the eating of the new fruits as a sacra-ment or communion with a deity, or at all events with a powerful spirit.Page 376"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"Among the usages which point to this conclusion are the custom of employing either new orspecially reserved vessels to hold the new fruits, and the practice of purifying the persons ofthe communicants before it is lawful to engage in the solemn act of communion with the divin-ity. Of all the modes of purification adopted on these occasions none perhaps brings out thesacramental virtue of the rite so clearly as the Creek and Seminole practice of taking a purga-tive before swallowing the new corn. The intention is thereby to prevent the sacred food frombeing polluted by contact with common food in the stomach of the eater. For the same reasonCatholics partake of the Eucharist fasting; and among the pastoral Masai of Eastern Africathe young warriors, who live on meat and milk exclusively, are obliged to eat nothing but milkfor so many days and then nothing but meat for so many more, and before they pass fromthe one food to the other they must make sure that none of the old food remains in theirstomachs; this they do by swallowing a very powerful purgative and emetic.In some of the festivals which we have examined, the sacrament of first-fruits is combinedwith a sacrifice or presentation of them to gods or spirits, and in course of time the sacrifice offirst-fruits tends to throw the sacrament into the shade, if not to supersede it. The mere fact ofoffering the first-fruits to the gods or spirits comes now to be thought a sufficient preparationfor eating the new corn; the higher powers having received their share, man is free to enjoythe rest. This mode of viewing the new fruits implies that they are regarded no longer asthemselves instinct with divine life, but merely as a gift bestowed by the gods upon man, whois bound to express his gratitude and homage to his divine benefactors by returning to them aportion of their bounty.2. EATING THE GOD AMONG THE AZTECSThe custom of eating bread sacramentally as the body of a god was practised by the Aztecsbefore the discovery and conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards. Twice a year, in May andDecember, an image of the great Mexican god Huitzilopochtli or Vitzilipuztli was made ofdough, then broken in pieces, and solemnly eaten by his worshippers. The May ceremony isthus described by the historian Acosta: “The Mexicans in the month of May made their princi-pal feast to their god Vitzilipuztli, and two days before this feast, the virgins whereof I havespoken (the which were shut up and secluded in the same temple and were as it were reli-gious women) did mingle a quantity of the seed of beets with roasted maize, and then theydid mould it with honey, making an idol of that paste in bigness like to that of wood, puttinginstead of eyes grains of green glass, of blue or white; and for teeth grains of maize set forthwith all the ornament and furniture that I have said. This being finished, all the noblemencame and brought it an exquisite and rich garment, like unto that of the idol, wherewith theydid attire it. Being thus clad and deckt, they did set it in an azured chair and in a litter to carryit on their shoulders. The morning of this feast being come, an hour before day all the maid-ens came forth attired in white, with new ornaments, the which that day were called theSisters of their god Vitzilipuztli, they came crowned with garlands of maize roasted andparched, being like unto azahar or the flower of orange; and about their necks they had greatchains of the same, which went bauldrick-wise under their left arm. Their cheeks were dyedwith vermilion, their arms from the elbow to the wrist were covered with red parrots’ feathers.”Young men, dressed in red robes and crowned like the virgins with maize, then carried theidol in its litter to the foot of the great pyramid-shaped temple, up the steep and narrow stepsof which it was drawn to the music of flutes, trumpets, cornets, and drums. “While theymounted up the idol all the people stood in the court with much reverence and fear. Beingmounted to the top, and that they had placed it in a little lodge of roses which they held ready,presently came the young men, which strewed many flowers of sundry kinds, wherewith theyPage 377"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"filled the temple both within and without. This done, all the virgins came out of their convent,bringing pieces of paste compounded of beets and roasted maize, which was of the samepaste whereof their idol was made and compounded, and they were of the fashion of greatbones. They delivered them to the young men, who carried them up and laid them at theidol’s feet, wherewith they filled the whole place that it could receive no more. They calledthese morsels of paste the flesh and bones of Vitzilipuztli. Having laid abroad these bones,presently came all the ancients of the temple, priests, Levites, and all the rest of the minis-ters, according to their dignities and antiquities (for herein there was a strict order amongstthem) one after another, with their veils of diverse colours and works, every one according tohis dignity and office, having garlands upon their heads and chains of flowers about theirnecks; after them came their gods and goddesses whom they worshipped, of diverse figures,attired in the same livery; then putting themselves in order about those morsels and pieces ofpaste, they used certain ceremonies with singing and dancing. By means whereof they wereblessed and consecrated for the flesh and bones of this idol. This ceremony and blessing(whereby they were taken for the flesh and bones of the idol) being ended, they honouredthose pieces in the same sort as their god.... All the city came to this goodly spectacle, andthere was a commandment very strictly observed throughout all the land, that the day of thefeast of the idol of Vitzilipuztli they should eat no other meat but this paste, with honey,whereof the idol was made. And this should be eaten at the point of day, and they shoulddrink no water nor any other thing till after noon: they held it for an ill sign, yea, for sacrilegeto do the contrary: but after the ceremonies ended, it was lawful for them to eat anything.During the time of this ceremony they hid the water from their little children, admonishing allsuch as had the use of reason not to drink any water; which, if they did, the anger of Godwould come upon them, and they should die, which they did observe very carefully and strict-ly. The ceremonies, dancing, and sacrifice ended, the went to unclothe themselves, and thepriests and superiors of the temple took the idol of paste, which they spoiled of all the orna-ments it had, and made many pieces, as well of the idol itself as of the truncheons which theyconsecrated, and then they gave them to the people in manner of a communion, beginningwith the greater, and continuing unto the rest, both men, women, and little children, whoreceived it with such tears, fear, and reverence as it was an admirable thing, saying that theydid eat the flesh and bones of God, where-with they were grieved. Such as had any sick folksdemanded thereof for them, and carried it with great reverence and veneration.”From this interesting passage we learn that the ancient Mexicans, even before the arrival ofChristian missionaries, were fully acquainted with the doctrine of transubstantiation and actedupon it in the solemn rites of their religion. They believed that by consecrating bread theirpriests could turn it into the very body of their god, so that all who thereupon partook of theconsecrated bread entered into a mystic communion with the deity by receiving a portion ofhis divine substance into themselves. The doctrine of transubstantiation, or the magical con-version of bread into flesh, was also familiar to the Aryans of ancient India long before thespread and even the rise of Christianity. The Brahmans taught that the rice-cakes offered insacrifice were substitutes for human beings, and that they were actually converted into thereal bodies of men by the manipulation of the priest. We read that “when it (the rice-cake) stillconsists of rice-meal, it is the hair. When he pours water on it, it becomes skin. When hemixes it, it becomes flesh: for then it becomes consistent; and consistent also is the flesh.When it is baked, it becomes bone: for then it becomes somewhat hard; and hard is thebone. And when he is about to take it off (the fire) and sprinkles it with butter, he changes itinto marrow. This is the completeness which they call the fivefold animal sacrifice.”Now, too, we can perfectly understand why on the day of their solemn communion with thePage 378"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"deity the Mexicans refused to eat any other food than the consecrated bread which theyrevered as the very flesh and bones of their God, and why up till noon they might drink noth-ing at all, not even water. They feared no doubt to defile the portion of God in their stomachsby contact with common things. A similar pious fear led the Creek and Seminole Indians, aswe saw, to adopt the more thoroughgoing expedient of rinsing out their bodies by a strongpurgative before they dared to partake of the sacrament of first-fruits.At the festival of the winter solstice in December the Aztecs killed their god Huitzilopochtli ineffigy first and ate him afterwards. As a preparation for this solemn ceremony an image of thedeity in the likeness of a man was fashioned out of seeds of various sorts, which were knead-ed into a dough with the blood of children. The bones of the god were represented by piecesof acacia wood. This image was placed on the chief altar of the temple, and on the day of thefestival the king offered incense to it. Early next day it was taken down and set on its feet in agreat hall. Then a priest, who bore the name and acted the part of the god Quetzalcoatl, tooka flint-tipped dart and hurled it into the breast of the dough-image, piercing it through andthrough. This was called “killing the god Huitzilopochtli so that his body might be eaten.” Oneof the priests cut out the heart of the image and gave it to the king to eat. The rest of theimage was divided into minute pieces, of which every man great and small, down to the malechildren in the cradle, receive one to eat. But no woman might taste a morsel. The ceremonywas called teoqualo, that is, “god is eaten.”At another festival the Mexicans made little images like men, which stood for the cloud-capped mountains. These images were moulded of a paste of various seeds and weredressed in paper ornaments. Some people fashioned five, others ten, others as many as fif-teen of them. Having been made, they were placed in the oratory of each house and wor-shipped. Four times in the course of the night offerings of food were brought to them in tinyvessels; and people sang and played the flute before them through all the hours of darkness.At break of day the priests stabbed the images with a weaver’s instrument, cut off theirheads, and tore out their hearts, which they presented to the master of the house on a greensaucer. The bodies of the images were then eaten by all the family, especially by the ser-vants, “in order that by eating them they might be preserved from certain distempers, to whichthose persons who were negligent of worship to those deities conceived themselves to besubject.”3. MANY MANII AT ARICIAWe are now able to suggest an explanation of the proverb “There are many Manii at Aricia.”Certain loaves made in the shape of men were called by the Romans maniae, and it appearsthat this kind of loaf was especially made at Aricia. Now, Mania, the name of one of theseloaves, was also the name of the Mother or Grandmother of Ghosts, to whom woollen effigiesof men and women were dedicated at the festival of the Compitalia. These effigies were hungat the doors of all the houses in Rome; one effigy was hung up for every free person in thehouse, and one effigy, of a different kind, for every slave. The reason was that on this day theghosts of the dead were believed to be going about, and it was hoped that, either out of goodnature or through simple inadvertence, they would carry off the effigies at the door instead ofthe living people in the house. According to tradition, these woollen figures were substitutesfor a former custom of sacrificing human beings. Upon data so fragmentary and uncertain, itis impossible to build with confidence; but it seems worth suggesting that the loaves in humanform, which appear to have been baked at Aricia, were sacramental bread, and that in the olddays, when the divine King of the Wood was annually slain, loaves were made in his image,Page 379"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"like the paste figures of the gods in Mexico, and were eaten sacramentally by his worship-pers. The Mexican sacraments in honour of Huitzilopochtli were also accompanied by thesacrifice of human victims. The tradition that the founder of the sacred grove at Aricia was aman named Manius, from whom many Manii were descended, would thus be an etymologicalmyth invented to explain the name maniae as applied to these sacramental loaves. A dim rec-ollection of the original connexion of the loaves with human sacrifices may perhaps be tracedin the story that the effigies dedicated to Mania at the Compitalia were substitutes for humanvictims. The story itself, however, is probably devoid of foundation, since the practice of put-ting up dummies to divert the attention of ghosts or demons from living people is not uncom-mon.For example, the Tibetans stand in fear of innumerable earth-demons, all of whom are underthe authority of Old Mother Khön-ma. This goddess, who may be compared to the RomanMania, the Mother or Grandmother of Ghosts, is dressed in golden-yellow robes, holds agolden noose in her hand, and rides on a ram. In order to bar the dwelling-house against thefoul fiends, of whom Old Mother Khön-ma is mistress, an elaborate structure somewhatresembling a chandelier is fixed above the door on the outside of the house. It contains aram’s skull, a variety of precious objects such as gold-leaf, silver, and turquoise, also somedry food, such as rice, wheat, and pulse, and finally images or pictures of a man, a woman,and a house. “The object of these figures of a man, wife, and house is to deceive the demonsshould they still come in spite of this offering, and to mislead them into the belief that the fore-going pictures are the inmates of the house, so that they may wreak their wrath on these bitsof wood and to save the real human occupants.” When all is ready, a priest prays to OldMother Khön-ma that she would be pleased to accept these dainty offerings and to close theopen doors of the earth, in order that the demons may not come forth to infest and injure thehousehold.Again, effigies are often employed as a means of preventing or curing sickness; the demonsof disease either mistake the effigies for living people or are persuaded or compelled to enterthem, leaving the real men and women well and whole. Thus the Alfoors of Minahassa, inCelebes, will sometimes transport a sick man to another house, while they leave on his bed adummy made up of a pillow and clothes. This dummy the demon is supposed to mistake forthe sick man, who consequently recovers. Cure or prevention of this sort seems to find espe-cial favour with the natives of Borneo. Thus, when an epidemic is raging among them, theDyaks of the Katoengouw River set up wooden images at their doors in the hope that thedemons of the plague may be deluded into carrying off the effigies instead of the people.Among the Oloh Ngadju of Borneo, when a sick man is supposed to be suffering from theassaults of a ghost, puppets of dough or rice-meal are made and thrown under the house assubstitutes for the patient, who thus rids himself of the ghost. In certain of the western dis-tricts of Borneo if a man is taken suddenly and violently sick, the physician, who in this part ofthe world is generally an old woman, fashions a wooden image and brings it seven times intocontact with the sufferer’s head, while she says: “This image serves to take the place of thesick man; sickness, pass over into the image.” Then, with some rice, salt, and tobacco in a lit-tle basket, the substitute is carried to the spot where the evil spirit is supposed to haveentered into the man. There it is set upright on the ground, after the physician has invokedthe spirit as follows: “O devil, here is an image which stands instead of the sick man. Releasethe soul of the sick man and plague the image, for it is indeed prettier and better than he.”Batak magicians can conjure the demon of disease out of the patient’s body into an imagemade out of a banana-tree with a human face and wrapt up in magic herbs; the image is thenhurriedly removed and thrown away or buried beyond the boundaries of the village.Page 380"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"Sometimes the image, dressed as a man or a woman according to the sex of the patient, isdeposited at a cross-road or other thoroughfare, in the hope that some passer-by, seeing it,may start and cry out, “Ah! So-and-So is dead”; for such an exclamation is supposed todelude the demon of disease into a belief that he has accomplished his fell purpose, so hetakes himself off and leaves the sufferer to get well. The Mai Darat, a Sakai tribe of the MalayPeninsula, attribute all kinds of diseases to the agency of spirits which they call nyani; fortu-nately, however, the magician can induce these maleficent beings to come out of the sick per-son and take up their abode in rude figures of grass, which are hung up outside the houses inlittle bell-shaped shrines decorated with peeled sticks. During an epidemic of small-pox theEwe negroes will sometimes clear a space outside of the town, where they erect a number oflow mounds and cover them with as many little clay figures as there are people in the place.Pots of food and water are also set out for the refreshment of the spirit of small-pox who, it ishoped, will take the clay figures and spare the living folk; and to make assurance doubly surethe road into the town is barricaded against him.With these examples before us we may surmise that the woollen effigies, which at the festivalof the Compitalia might be seen hanging at the doors of all the houses in ancient Rome, werenot substitutes for human victims who had formerly been sacrificed at this season, but rathervicarious offerings presented to the Mother or Grandmother of Ghosts, in the hope that on herrounds through the city she would accept or mistake the effigies for the inmates of the houseand so spare the living for another year. It is possible that the puppets made of rushes, whichin the month of May the pontiffs and Vestal Virgins annually threw into the Tiber from the oldSublician bridge at Rome, had originally the same significance; that is, they may have beendesigned to purge the city from demoniac influence by diverting the attention of the demonsfrom human beings to the puppets and then toppling the whole uncanny crew, neck and crop,into the river, which would soon sweep them far out to sea. In precisely the same way thenatives of Old Calabar used periodically to rid their town of the devils which infested it by lur-ing the unwary demons into a number of lamentable scarecrows, which they afterwards flunginto the river. This interpretation of the Roman custom is supported to some extent by the evi-dence of Plutarch, who speaks of the ceremony as “the greatest of purifications.”Chapter LIHomeopathic Magic of a Flesh DietTHE practice of killing a god has now been traced amongst peoples who have reached theagricultural stage of society. We have seen that the spirit of the corn, or of other cultivatedplants, is commonly represented either in human or in animal form, and that in some places acustom has prevailed of killing annually either the human or the animal representative of thegod. One reason for thus killing the corn-spirit in the person of his representative has beengiven implicitly in an earlier part of this work: we may suppose that the intention was to guardhim or her (for the corn-spirit is often feminine) from the enfeeblement of old age by transfer-ring the spirit, while still hale and hearty, to the person of a youthful and vigorous successor.Apart from the desirability of renewing his divine energies, the death of the corn-spirit mayhave been deemed inevitable under the sickles or the knives of the reapers, and his worship-pers may accordingly have felt bound to acquiesce in the sad necessity. But, further, we havefound a widespread custom of eating the god sacramentally, either in the shape of the man oranimal who represents the god, or in the shape of bread made in human or animal form. Thereasons for thus partaking of the body of the god are, from the primitive standpoint, simpleenough. The savage commonly believes that by eating the flesh of an animal or man heacquires not only the physical, but even the moral and intellectual qualities which were char-Page 381"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"acteristic of that animal or man; so when the creature is deemed divine, our simple savagenaturally expects to absorb a portion of its divinity along with its material substance. It may bewell to illustrate by instances this common faith in the acquisition of virtues or vices of manykinds through the medium of animal food, even when there is no pretence that the viandsconsist of the body or blood of a god. The doctrine forms part of the widely ramified system ofsympathetic or homoeopathic magic.Thus, for example, the Creeks, Cherokee, and kindred tribes of North American Indians“believe that nature is possest of such a property as to transfuse into men and animals thequalities, either of the food they use, or of those objects that are presented to their senses; hewho feeds on venison is, according to their physical system, swifter and more sagacious thanthe man who lives on the flesh of the clumsy bear, or helpless dunghill fowls, the slow-footedtame cattle, or the heavy wallowing swine. This is the reason that several of their old menrecommend, and say, that formerly their greatest chieftains observed a constant rule in theirdiet, and seldom ate of any animal of a gross quality, or heavy motion of body, fancying itconveyed a dullness through the whole system, and disabled them from exerting themselveswith proper vigour in their martial, civil, and religious duties.” The Zaparo Indians of Ecuador“will, unless from necessity, in most cases not eat any heavy meats, such as tapir and pecca-ry, but confine themselves to birds, monkeys, deer, fish, etc., principally because they arguethat the heavier meats make them unwieldy, like the animals who supply the flesh, impedingtheir agility, and unfitting them for the chase.” Similarly some of the Brazilian Indians wouldeat no beast, bird, or fish that ran, flew, or swam slowly, lest by partaking of its flesh theyshould lose their ability and be unable to escape from their enemies. The Caribs abstainedfrom the flesh of pigs lest it should cause them to have small eyes like pigs; and they refusedto partake of tortoises from a fear that if they did so they would become heavy and stupid likethe animal. Among the Fans of West Africa men in the prime of life never eat tortoises for asimilar reason; they imagine that if they did so, their vigour and fleetness of foot would begone. But old men may eat tortoises freely, because having already lost the power of runningthey can take no harm from the flesh of the slow-footed creature.While many savages thus fear to eat the flesh of slow-footed animals lest they should them-selves become slow-footed, the Bushmen of South Africa purposely ate the flesh of suchcreatures, and the reason which they gave for doing so exhibits a curious refinement of sav-age philosophy. They imagined that the game which they pursued would be influenced sym-pathetically by the food in the body of the hunter, so that if he had eaten of swift-footed ani-mals, the quarry would be swift-footed also and would escape him; whereas if he had eatenof slow-footed animals, the quarry would also be slow-footed, and he would be able to over-take and kill it. For that reason hunters of gemsbok particularly avoided eating the flesh of theswift and agile springbok; indeed they would not even touch it with their hands, because theybelieved the springbok to be a very lively creature which did not go to sleep at night, and theythought that if they ate springbok, the gemsbok which they hunted would likewise not be will-ing to go to sleep, even at night. How, then, could they catch it?The Namaquas abstain from eating the flesh of hares, because they think it would make themfaint-hearted as a hare. But they eat the flesh of the lion, or drink the blood of the leopard orlion, to get the courage and strength of these beasts. The Bushmen will not give their childrena jackal’s heart to eat, lest it should make them timid like the jackal; but they give them aleopard’s heart to eat to make them brave like the leopard. When a Wagogo man of EastAfrica kills a lion, he eats the heart in order to become brave like a lion; but he thinks that toeat the heart of a hen would make him timid. When a serious disease has attacked a ZuluPage 382"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"kraal, the medicine-man takes the bone of a very old dog, or the bone of an old cow, bull, orother very old animal, and administers it to the healthy as well as to the sick people, in orderthat they may live to be as old as the animal of whose bone they have partaken. So to restorethe aged Aeson to youth, the witch Medea infused into his veins a decoction of the liver of thelong-lived deer and the head of a crow that had outlived nine generations of men.Among the Dyaks of North-West Borneo young men and warriors may not eat venison,because it would make them as timid as deer; but the women and very old men are free toeat it. However, among the Kayans of the same region, who share the same view as to the illeffect of eating venison, men will partake of the dangerous viand provided it is cooked in theopen air, for then the timid spirit of the animal is supposed to escape at once into the jungleand not to enter into the eater. The Aino believe that the heart of the water-ousel is exceed-ingly wise, and that in speech the bird is most eloquent. Therefore whenever he is killed, heshould be at once torn open and his heart wrenched out and swallowed before it has time togrow cold or suffer damage of any kind. If a man swallows it thus, he will become very fluentand wise, and will be able to argue down all his adversaries. In Northern India people fancythat if you eat the eyeballs of an owl you will be able like an owl to see in the dark.When the Kansas Indians were going to war, a feast used to be held in the chief’s hut, andthe principal dish was dog’s flesh, because, said the Indians, the animal who is so brave thathe will let himself be cut in pieces in defence of his master, must needs inspire valour. Men ofthe Buru and Aru Islands, East Indies, eat the flesh of dogs in order to be bold and nimble inwar. Amongst the Papuans of the Port Moresby and Motumotu districts, New Guinea, younglads eat strong pig, wallaby, and large fish, in order to acquire the strength of the animal orfish. Some of the natives of Northern Australia fancy that by eating the flesh of the kangarooor emu they are enabled to jump or run faster than before. The Miris of Assam prize tiger’sflesh as food for men; it gives them strength and courage. But “it is not suited for women; itwould make them too strong-minded.” In Corea the bones of tigers fetch a higher price thanthose of leopards as a means of inspiring courage. A Chinaman in Seoul bought and ate awhole tiger to make himself brave and fierce. In Norse legend, Ingiald, son of King Aunund,was timid in his youth, but after eating the heart of a wolf he became very bold; Hialto gainedstrength and courage by eating the heart of a bear and drinking its blood.In Morocco lethargic patients are given ants to swallow, and to eat lion’s flesh will make acoward brave; but people abstain from eating the hearts of fowls, lest thereby they should berendered timid. When a child is late in learning to speak, the Turks of Central Asia will give itthe tongues of certain birds to eat. A North American Indian thought that brandy must be adecoction of hearts and tongues, “because,” said he, “after drinking it I fear nothing, and I talkwonderfully.” In Java there is a tiny earthworm which now and then utters a shrill sound likethat of the alarum of a small clock. Hence when a public dancing girl has screamed herselfhoarse in the exercise of her calling, the leader of the troop makes her eat some of theseworms, in the belief that thus she will regain her voice and will, after swallowing them, be ableto scream as shrilly as ever. The people of Darfur, in Central Africa, think that the liver is theseat of the soul, and that a man may enlarge his soul by eating the liver of an animal.“Whenever an animal is killed its liver is taken out and eaten, but the people are most carefulnot to touch it with their hands, as it is considered sacred; it is cut up in small pieces andeaten raw, the bits being conveyed to the mouth on the point of a knife, or the sharp point ofa stick. Any one who may accidentally touch the liver is strictly forbidden to partake of it,which prohibition is regarded as a great misfortune for him.” Women are not allowed to eatliver, because they have no soul.Page 383"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Again, the flesh and blood of dead men are commonly eaten and drunk to inspire bravery,wisdom, or other qualities for which the men themselves were remarkable, or which are sup-posed to have their special seat in the particular part eaten. Thus among the mountain tribesof South-Eastern Africa there are ceremonies by which the youths are formed into guilds orlodges, and among the rites of initiation there is one which is intended to infuse courage,intelligence, and other qualities into the novices. Whenever an enemy who has behaved withconspicuous bravery is killed, his liver, which is considered the seat of valour; his ears, whichare supposed to be the seat of intelligence; the skin of his forehead, which is regarded as theseat of perseverance; his testicles, which are held to be the seat of strength; and other mem-bers, which are viewed as the seat of other virtues, are cut from his body and baked to cin-ders. The ashes are carefully kept in the horn of a bull, and, during the ceremonies observedat circumcision, are mixed with other ingredients into a kind of paste, which is administeredby the tribal priest to the youths. By this means the strength, valour, intelligence, and othervirtues of the slain are believed to be imparted to the eaters. When Basutos of the mountainshave killed a very brave foe, they immediately cut out his heart and eat it, because this issupposed to give them his courage and strength in battle. When Sir Charles M’Carthy waskilled by the Ashantees in 1824, it is said that his heart was devoured by the chiefs of theAshantee army, who hoped by this means to imbibe his courage. His flesh was dried and par-celled out among the lower officers for the same purpose, and his bones were long kept atCoomassie as national fetishes. The Nauras Indians of New Granada ate the hearts ofSpaniards when they had the opportunity, hoping thereby to make themselves as dauntlessas the dreaded Castilian chivalry. The Sioux Indians used to reduce to powder the heart of avaliant enemy and swallow the powder, hoping thus to appropriate the dead man’s valour.But while the human heart is thus commonly eaten for the sake of imbuing the eater with thequalities of its original owner, it is not, as we have already seen, the only part of the bodywhich is consumed for this purpose. Thus warriors of the Theddora and Ngarigo tribes ofSouth-Eastern Australia used to eat the hands and feet of their slain enemies, believing thatin this way they acquired some of the qualities and courage of the dead. The Kamilaroi ofNew South Wales ate the liver as well as the heart of a brave man to get his courage. InTonquin also there is a popular superstition that the liver of a brave man makes brave anywho partake of it. With a like intent the Chinese swallow the bile of notorious bandits whohave been executed. The Dyaks of Sarawak used to eat the palms of the hands and the fleshof the knees of the slain in order to steady their own hands and strengthen their own knees.The Tolalaki, notorious head-hunters of Central Celebes, drink the blood and eat the brains oftheir victims that they may become brave. The Italones of the Philippine Islands drink theblood of their slain enemies, and eat part of the back of their heads and of their entrails rawto acquire their courage. For the same reason the Efugaos, another tribe of the Philippines,suck the brains of their foes. In like manner the Kai of German New Guinea eat the brains ofthe enemies they kill in order to acquire their strength. Among the Kimbunda of WesternAfrica, when a new king succeeds to the throne, a brave prisoner of war is killed in order thatthe king and nobles may eat his flesh, and so acquire his strength and courage. The notori-ous Zulu chief Matuana drank the gall of thirty chiefs, whose people he had destroyed, in thebelief that it would make him strong. It is a Zulu fancy that by eating the centre of the fore-head and the eyebrow of an enemy they acquire the power of looking steadfastly at a foe.Before every warlike expedition the people of Minahassa in Celebes used to take the locks ofhair of a slain foe and dabble them in boiling water to extract the courage; this infusion ofbravery was then drunk by the warriors. In New Zealand “the chief was an atua [god], butthere were powerful and powerless gods; each naturally sought to make himself one of thePage 384"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"former; the plan therefore adopted was to incorporate the spirits of others with their own;thus, when a warrior slew a chief, he immediately gouged out his eyes and swallowed them,the atua tonga, or divinity, being supposed to reside in that organ; thus he not only killed thebody, but also possessed himself of the soul of his enemy, and consequently the more chiefshe slew the greater did his divinity become.”It is now easy to understand why a savage should desire to partake of the flesh of an animalor man whom he regards as divine. By eating the body of the god he shares in the god’sattributes and powers. And when the god is a corn-god, the corn is his proper body; when heis a vine-god, the juice of the grape is his blood; and so by eating the bread and drinking thewine the worshipper partakes of the real body and blood of his god. Thus the drinking of winein the rites of a vine-god like Dionysus is not an act of revelry, it is a solemn sacrament. Yet atime comes when reasonable men find it hard to understand how any one in his senses cansuppose that by eating bread or drinking wine he consumes the body or blood of a deity.“When we call corn Ceres and wine Bacchus,” says Cicero, “we use a common figure ofspeech; but do you imagine that anybody is so insane as to believe that the thing he feedsupon is a god?”Chapter LIIKilling the Divine Animal1. KILLING THE SACRED BUZZARDIN the preceding chapters we saw that many communities which have progressed so far as tosubsist mainly by agriculture have been in the habit of killing and eating their farinaceousdeities either in their proper form of corn, rice, and so forth, or in the borrowed shapes of ani-mals and men. It remains to show that hunting and pastoral tribes, as well as agricultural peo-ples, have been in the habit of killing the beings whom they worship. Among the worshipfulbeings or gods, if indeed they deserve to be dignified by that name, whom hunters and shep-herds adore and kill are animals pure and simple, not animals regarded as embodiments ofother supernatural beings. Our first example is drawn from the Indians of California, who liv-ing in a fertile country under a serene and temperate sky, nevertheless rank near the bottomof the savage scale. The Acagchemem tribe adored the great buzzard, and once a year theycelebrated a great festival called Panes or bird-feast in its honour. The day selected for thefestival was made known to the public on the evening before its celebration and preparationswere at once made for the erection of a special temple (vanquech), which seems to havebeen a circular or oval enclosure of stakes with the stuffed skin of a coyote or prairie-wolf setup on a hurdle to represent the god Chinigchinich. When the temple was ready, the bird wascarried into it in solemn procession and laid on an altar erected for the purpose. Then all theyoung women, whether married or single, began to run to and fro, as if distracted, some inone direction and some in another, while the elders of both sexes remained silent spectatorsof the scene, and the captains, tricked out in paint and feathers, danced round their adoredbird. These ceremonies being concluded, they seized upon the bird and carried it to the prin-cipal temple, all the assembly uniting in the grand display, and the captains dancing andsinging at the head of the procession. Arrived at the temple, they killed the bird without losinga drop of its blood. The skin was removed entire and preserved with the feathers as a relic orfor the purpose of making the festal garment or paelt. The carcase was buried in a hole in thetemple, and the old women gathered round the grave weeping and moaning bitterly, whilethey threw various kinds of seeds or pieces of food on it, crying out, “Why did you run away?Would you not have been better with us? you would have made pinole (a kind of gruel) as wePage 385"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"do, and if you had not run away, you would not have become a Panes,” and so on. When thisceremony was concluded, the dancing was resumed and kept up for three days and nights.They said that the Panes was a woman who had run off to the mountains and there beenchanged into a bird by the god Chinigchinich. They believed that though they sacrificed thebird annually, she came to life again and returned to her home in the mountains. Moreover,they thought that “as often as the bird was killed, it became multiplied; because every year allthe different Capitanes celebrated the same feast of Panes, and were firm in the opinion thatthe birds sacrificed were but one and the same female.”The unity in multiplicity thus postulated by the Californians is very noticeable and helps toexplain their motive for killing the divine bird. The notion of the life of a species as distinctfrom that of an individual, easy and obvious as it seems to us, appears to be one which theCalifornian savage cannot grasp. He is unable to conceive the life of the species otherwisethan as an individual life, and therefore as exposed to the same dangers and calamitieswhich menace and finally destroy the life of the individual. Apparently he imagines that aspecies left to itself will grow old and die like an individual, and that therefore some step mustbe taken to save from extinction the particular species which he regards as divine. The onlymeans he can think of to avert the catastrophe is to kill a member of the species in whoseveins the tide of life is still running strong and has not yet stagnated among the fens of oldage. The life thus diverted from one channel will flow, he fancies, more freshly and freely in anew one; in other words, the slain animal will revive and enter on a new term of life with allthe spring and energy of youth. To us this reasoning is transparently absurd, but so too is thecustom. A similar confusion, it may be noted, between the individual life and the life of thespecies was made by the Samoans. Each family had for its god a particular species of ani-mal; yet the death of one of these animals, for example an owl, was not the death of the god,“he was supposed to be yet alive, and incarnate in all the owls in existence.”2. KILLING THE SACRED RAMThe rude Californian rite which we have just considered has a close parallel in the religion ofancient Egypt. The Thebans and all other Egyptians who worshipped the Theban god Ammonheld rams to be sacred, and would not sacrifice them. But once a year at the festival ofAmmon they killed a ram, skinned it, and clothed the image of the god in the skin. Then theymourned over the ram and buried it in a sacred tomb. The custom was explained by a storythat Zeus had once exhibited himself to Hercules clad in the fleece and wearing the head of aram. Of course the ram in this case was simply the beast-god of Thebes, as the wolf was thebeast-god of Lycopolis, and the goat was the beast-god of Mendes. In other words, the ramwas Ammon himself. On the monuments, it is true, Ammon appears in semi-human form withthe body of a man and the head of a ram. But this only shows that he was in the usualchrysalis state through which beast-gods regularly pass before they emerge as full-blownanthropomorphic gods. The ram, therefore, was killed, not as a sacrifice to Ammon, but asthe god himself, whose identity with the beast is plainly shown by the custom of clothing hisimage in the skin of the slain ram. The reason for thus killing the ram-god annually may havebeen that which I have assigned for the general custom of killing a god and for the specialCalifornian custom of killing the divine buzzard. As applied to Egypt, this explanation is sup-ported by the analogy of the bull-god Apis, who was not suffered to outlive a certain term ofyears. The intention of thus putting a limit to the life of the human god was, as I have argued,to secure him from the weakness and frailty of age. The same reasoning would explain thecustom—probably an older one—of putting the beast-god to death annually, as was done withthe ram of Thebes.Page 386"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"One point in the Theban ritual—the application of the skin to the image of the god—deservesparticular attention. If the god was at first the living ram, his representation by an image musthave originated later. But how did it originate? One answer to this question is perhaps fur-nished by the practice of preserving the skin of the animal which is slain as divine. TheCalifornians, as we have seen, preserved the skin of the buzzard; and the skin of the goat,which is killed on the harvest-field as a representative of the corn-spirit, is kept for varioussuperstitious purposes. The skin in fact was kept as a token or memorial of the god, or ratheras containing in it a part of the divine life, and it had only to be stuffed or stretched upon aframe to become a regular image of him. At first an image of this kind would be renewedannually, the new image being provided by the skin of the slain animal. But from annualimages to permanent images the transition is easy. We have seen that the older custom ofcutting a new May-tree every year was superseded by the practice of maintaining a perma-nent May-pole, which was, however, annually decked with fresh leaves and flowers, and evensurmounted each year by a fresh young tree. Similarly when the stuffed skin, as a represen-tative of the god, was replaced by a permanent image of him in wood, stone, or metal, thepermanent image was annually clad in the fresh skin of the slain animal. When this stage hadbeen reached, the custom of killing the ram came naturally to be interpreted as a sacrificeoffered to the image, and was explained by a story like that of Ammon and Hercules.3. KILLING THE SACRED SERPENTWest Africa appears to furnish another example of the annual killing of a sacred animal andthe preservation of its skin. The negroes of Issapoo, in the island of Fernando Po, regard thecobra-capella as their guardian deity, who can do them good or ill, bestow riches or inflict dis-ease and death. The skin of one of these reptiles is hung tail downwards from a branch of thehighest tree in the public square, and the placing of it on the tree is an annual ceremony. Assoon as the ceremony is over, all children born within the past year are carried out and theirhands made to touch the tail of the serpent’s skin. The latter custom is clearly a way of plac-ing the infants under the protection of the tribal god. Similarly in Senegambia a python isexpected to visit every child of the Python clan within eight days after birth; and the Psylli, aSnake clan of ancient Africa, used to expose their infants to snakes in the belief that thesnakes would not harm true-born children of the clan.4. KILLING THE SACRED TURTLESIn the Californian, Egyptian, and Fernando Po customs the worship of the animal seems tohave no relation to agriculture, and may therefore be presumed to date from the hunting orpastoral stage of society. The same may be said of the following custom, though the ZuniIndians of New Mexico, who practise it, are now settled in walled villages or towns of a pecu-liar type, and practise agriculture and the arts of pottery and weaving. But the Zuni custom ismarked by certain features which appear to place it in a somewhat different class from thepreceding cases. It may be well therefore to describe it at full length in the words of an eye-witness.“With midsummer the heat became intense. My brother [i.e. adopted Indian brother] and I sat,day after day, in the cool under-rooms of our house,—the latter [sic] busy with his quaint forgeand crude appliances, working Mexican coins over into bangles, girdles, ear-rings, buttons,and what not, for savage ornament. Though his tools were wonderfully rude, the work heturned out by dint of combined patience and ingenuity was remarkably beautiful. One day as IPage 387"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"sat watching him, a procession of fifty men went hastily down the hill, and off westward overthe plain. They were solemnly led by a painted and shell-bedecked priest, and followed by thetorch-bearing Shu-lu-wit-si or God of Fire. After they had vanished, I asked old brother what itall meant.“‘They are going,’ said he, ‘to the city of Ka-ka and the home of our others.’“Four days after, towards sunset, costumed and masked in the beautiful paraphernalia of theKa-k’ok-shi, or ‘Good Dance,’ they returned in file up the same pathway, each bearing in hisarms a basket filled with living, squirming turtles, which he regarded and carried as tenderlyas a mother would her infant. Some of the wretched reptiles were carefully wrapped in softblankets, their heads and forefeet protruding,—and, mounted on the backs of the plume-bedecked pilgrims, made ludicrous but solemn caricatures of little children in the same posi-tion. While I was at supper upstairs that evening, the governor’s brother-in-law came in. Hewas welcomed by the family as if a messenger from heaven. He bore in his tremulous fingersone of the much abused and rebellious turtles. Paint still adhered to his hands and bare feet,which led me to infer that he had formed one of the sacred embassy.“‘So you went to Ka-thlu-el-lon, did you?’ I asked.“‘E’e,’ replied the weary man, in a voice husky with long chanting, as he sank, almostexhausted, on a roll of skins which had been placed for him, and tenderly laid the turtle onthe floor. No sooner did the creature find itself at liberty than it made off as fast as its lamelegs would take it. Of one accord, the family forsook dish, spoon, and drinking-cup, and grab-bing from a sacred meal-bowl whole handfuls of the contents, hurriedly followed the turtleabout the room, into dark corners, around water-jars, behind the grinding-troughs, and outinto the middle of the floor again, praying and scattering meal on its back as they went. Atlast, strange to say, it approached the foot-sore man who had brought it.“‘Ha!’ he exclaimed with emotion; ‘see it comes to me again; ah, what great favours thefathers of all grant me this day,’ and, passing his hand gently over the sprawling animal, heinhaled from his palm deeply and long, at the same time invoking the favour of the gods.Then he leaned his chin upon his hand, and with large, wistful eyes regarded his ugly captiveas it sprawled about, blinking its meal-bedimmed eyes, and clawing the smooth floor in mem-ory of its native element. At this juncture I ventured a question:“‘Why do you not let him go, or give him some water?’“Slowly the man turned his eyes toward me, an odd mixture of pain, indignation, and pity onhis face, while the worshipful family stared at me with holy horror.“‘Poor younger brother!’ he said at last, ‘know you not how precious it is? It die? It will not die;I tell you, it cannot die.’“‘But it will die if you don’t feed it and give it water.’“‘I tell you it cannot die; it will only change houses to-morrow, and go back to the home of itsbrothers. Ah, well! How should you know?’ he mused. Turning to the blinded turtle again: ‘Ah!my poor dear lost child or parent, my sister or brother to have been! Who knows which?Maybe my own great-grandfather or mother!’ And with this he fell to weeping most pathetical-Page 388"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"ly, and, tremulous with sobs, which were echoed by the women and children, he buried hisface in his hands. Filled with sympathy for his grief, however mistaken, I raised the turtle tomy lips and kissed its cold shell; then depositing it on the floor, hastily left the grief-strickenfamily to their sorrows. Next day, with prayers and tender beseechings, plumes, and offerings,the poor turtle was killed, and its flesh and bones were removed and deposited in the littleriver, that it might ‘return once more to eternal life among its comrades in the dark waters ofthe lake of the dead.’ The shell, carefully scraped and dried, was made into a dance-rattle,and, covered by a piece of buckskin, it still hangs from the smoke-stained rafters of my broth-er’s house. Once a Navajo tried to buy it for a ladle; loaded with indignant reproaches, hewas turned cut of the house. Were any one to venture the suggestion that the turtle no longerlived, his remark would cause a flood of tears, and he would be reminded that it had only‘changed houses and gone to live for ever in the home of “our lost others.”’”In this custom we find expressed in the clearest way a belief in the transmigration of humansouls into the bodies of turtles. The theory of transmigration is held by the Moqui Indians, whobelong to the same race as the Zunis. The Moquis are divided into totem clans—the Bearclan, Deer clan, Wolf clan, Hare clan, and so on; they believe that the ancestors of the clanswere bears, deer, wolves, hares, and so forth; and that at death the members of each clanbecome bears, deer, and so on according to the particular clan to which they belonged. TheZuni are also divided into clans, the totems of which agree closely with those of the Moquis,and one of their totems is the turtle. Thus their belief in transmigration into the turtle is proba-bly one of the regular articles of their totem faith. What then is the meaning of killing a turtle inwhich the soul of a kinsman is believed to be present? Apparently the object is to keep up acommunication with the other world in which the souls of the departed are believed to beassembled in the form of turtles. It is a common belief that the spirits of the dead return occa-sionally to their old homes; and accordingly the unseen visitors are welcomed and feasted bythe living, and then sent upon their way. In the Zuni ceremony the dead are fetched home inthe form of turtles, and the killing of the turtles is the way of sending back the souls to thespirit-land. Thus the general explanation given above of the custom of killing a god seemsinapplicable to the Zuni custom, the true meaning of which is somewhat obscure. Nor is theobscurity which hangs over the subject entirely dissipated by a later and fuller account whichwe possess of the ceremony. From it we learn that the ceremony forms part of the elaborateritual which these Indians observe at the midsummer solstice for the purpose of ensuring anabundant supply of rain for the crops. Envoys are despatched to bring “their otherselves, thetortoises,” from the sacred lake Kothluwalawa, to which the souls of the dead are believed torepair. When the creatures have thus been solemnly brought to Zuni, they are placed in abowl of water and dances are performed beside them by men in costume, who personategods and goddesses. “After the ceremonial the tortoises are taken home by those whocaught them and are hung by their necks to the rafters till morning, when they are thrown intopots of boiling water. The eggs are considered a great delicacy. The meat is seldom touchedexcept as a medicine, which is curative for cutaneous diseases. Part of the meat is depositedin the river with kóhakwa (white shell beads) and turquoise beads as offerings to Council ofthe Gods.” This account at all events confirms the inference that the tortoises are supposedto be reincarnations of the human dead, for they are called the “otherselves” of the Zuni;indeed, what else should they be than the souls of the dead in the bodies of tortoises seeingthat they come from the haunted lake? As the principal object of the prayers uttered and ofthe dances performed at these midsummer ceremonies appears to be to procure rain for thecrops, it may be that the intention of bringing the tortoises to Zuni and dancing before them isto intercede with the ancestral spirit, incarnate in the animals, that they may be pleased toexert their power over the waters of heaven for the benefit of their living descendants.Page 389"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"5. KILLING THE SACRED BEARDoubt also hangs at first sight over the meaning of the bear-sacrifice offered by the Aino orAinu, a primitive people who are found in the Japanese island of Yezo or Yesso, as well as inSaghalien and the southern of the Kurile Islands. It is not quite easy to define the attitude ofthe Aino towards the bear. On the one hand they give it the name of kamui or “god”; but asthey apply the same word to strangers, it may mean no more than a being supposed to beendowed with superhuman, or at all events extraordinary, powers. Again, it is said that “thebear is their chief divinity”; “in the religion of the Aino the bear plays a chief part”; “amongstthe animals it is especially the bear which receives an idolatrous veneration”; “they worship itafter their fashion”; “there is no doubt that this wild beast inspires more of the feeling whichprompts worship than the inanimate forces of nature, and the Aino may be distinguished asbear-worshippers.” Yet, on the other hand, they kill the bear whenever they can; “in bygoneyears the Ainu considered bear-hunting the most manly and useful way in which a personcould possibly spend his time”; “the men spend the autumn, winter, and spring in hunting deerand bears. Part of their tribute or taxes is paid in skins, and they subsist on the dried meat”;bear’s flesh is indeed one of their staple foods; they eat it both fresh and salted; and the skinsof bears furnish them with clothing. In fact, the worship of which writers on this subject speakappears to be paid chiefly to the dead animal. Thus, although they kill a bear whenever theycan, “in the process of dissecting the carcass they endeavor to conciliate the deity, whoserepresentative they have slain, by making elaborate obeisances and deprecatory salutations”;“when a bear has been killed the Ainu sit down and admire it, make their salaams to it, wor-ship it, and offer presents of inao”; “when a bear is trapped or wounded by an arrow, thehunters go through an apologetic or propitiatory ceremony.” The skulls of slain bears receivea place of honour in their huts, or are set up on sacred posts outside the huts, and are treat-ed with much respect: libations of millet beer, and of sake, an intoxicating liquor, are offeredto them; and they are addressed as “divine preservers” or “precious divinities.” The skulls offoxes are also fastened to the sacred posts outside the huts; they are regarded as charmsagainst evil spirits, and are consulted as oracles. Yet it is expressly said, “The live fox isrevered just as little as the bear; rather they avoid it as much as possible, considering it a wilyanimal.” The bear can hardly, therefore, be described as a sacred animal of the Aino, nor yetas a totem; for they do not call themselves bears, and they kill and eat the animal freely.However, they have a legend of a woman who had a son by a bear; and many of them whodwell in the mountains pride themselves on being descended from a bear. Such people arecalled “Descendants of the bear” (Kimun Kamui sanikiri), and in the pride of their heart theywill say, “As for me, I am a child of the god of the mountains; I am descended from the divineone who rules in the mountains,” meaning by “the god of the mountains” no other than thebear. It is therefore possible that, as our principal authority, the Rev. J. Batchelor, believes,the bear may have been the totem of an Aino clan; but even if that were so it would notexplain the respect shown for the animal by the whole Aino people.But it is the bear-festival of the Aino which concerns us here. Towards the end of winter abear cub is caught and brought into the village. If it is very small, it is suckled by an Ainowoman, but should there be no woman able to suckle it, the little animal is fed from the handor the mouth. During the day it plays about in the hut with the children and is treated withgreat affection. But when the cub grows big enough to pain people by hugging or scratchingthem, he is shut up in a strong wooden cage, where he stays generally for two or three years,fed on fish and millet porridge, till it is time for him to be killed and eaten. But “it is a peculiarlystriking fact that the young bear is not kept merely to furnish a good meal; rather he is regard-Page 390"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"ed and honoured as a fetish, or even as a sort of higher being.” In Yezo the festival is gener-ally celebrated in September or October. Before it takes place the Aino apologise to theirgods, alleging that they have treated the bear kindly as long as they could, now they can feedhim no longer, and are obliged to kill him. A man who gives a bear-feast invites his relationsand friends; in a small village nearly the whole community takes part in the feast; indeed,guests from distant villages are invited and generally come, allured by the prospect of gettingdrunk for nothing. The form of invitation runs somewhat as follows: “I, so and so, am about tosacrifice the dear little divine thing who resides among the mountains. My friends and mas-ters, come ye to the feast; we will then unite in the great pleasure of sending the god away.Come.” When all the people are assembled in front of the cage, an orator chosen for the pur-pose addresses the bear and tells it that they are about to send it forth to its ancestors. Hecraves pardon for what they are about to do to it, hopes it will not be angry, and comforts it byassuring the animal that many of the sacred whittled sticks (inao) and plenty of cakes andwine will be sent with it on the long journey. One speech of this sort which Mr. Batchelorheard ran as follows: “O thou divine one, thou wast sent into the world for us to hunt. O thouprecious little divinity, we worship thee; pray hear our prayer. We have nourished thee andbrought thee up with a deal of pains and trouble, all because we love thee so. Now, as thouhast grown big, we are about to send thee to thy father and mother. When thou comest tothem please speak well of us, and tell them how kind we have been; please come to us againand we will sacrifice thee.” Having been secured with ropes, the bear is then let out of thecage and assailed with a shower of blunt arrows in order to arouse it to fury. When it hasspent itself in vain struggles, it is tied up to a stake, gagged and strangled, its neck beingplaced between two poles, which are then violently compressed, all the people eagerly help-ing to squeeze the animal to death. An arrow is also discharged into the beast’s heart by agood marksman, but so as not to shed blood, for they think that it would be very unlucky ifany of the blood were to drip on the ground. However, the men sometimes drink the warmblood of the bear “that the courage and other virtues it possesses may pass into them”; andsometimes they besmear themselves and their clothes with the blood in order to ensure suc-cess in hunting. When the animal has been strangled to death, it is skinned and its head iscut off and set in the east window of the house, where a piece of its own flesh is placed underits snout, together with a cup of its own meat boiled, some millet dumplings, and dried fish.Prayers are then addressed to the dead animal; amongst other things it is sometimes invited,after going away to its father and mother, to return into the world in order that it may again bereared for sacrifice. When the bear is supposed to have finished eating its own flesh, the manwho presides at the feast takes the cup containing the boiled meat, salutes it, and divides thecontents between all the company present: every person, young and old alike, must taste alittle. The cup is called “the cup of offering” because it has just been offered to the dead bear.When the rest of the flesh has been cooked, it is shared out in like manner among all thepeople, everybody partaking of at least a morsel; not to partake of the feast would be equiva-lent to excommunication, it would be to place the recreant outside the pale of Aino fellowship.Formerly every particle of the bear, except the bones, had to be eaten up at the banquet, butthis rule is now relaxed. The head, on being detached from the skin, is set up on a long polebeside the sacred wands (inao) outside of the house, where it remains till nothing but thebare white skull is left. Skulls so set up are worshipped not only at the time of the festival, butvery often as long as they last. The Aino assured Mr. Batchelor that they really do believe thespirits of the worshipful animals to reside in the skulls; that is why they address them as“divine preservers” and “precious divinities.”The ceremony of killing the bear was witnessed by Dr. B. Scheube on the tenth of August atKunnui, which is a village on Volcano Bay in the island of Yezo or Yesso. As his description ofPage 391"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"the rite contains some interesting particulars not mentioned in the foregoing account, it maybe worth while to summarize it.On entering the hut he found about thirty Aino present, men, women, and children, alldressed in their best. The master of the house first offered a libation on the fireplace to thegod of the fire, and the guests followed his example. Then a libation was offered to thehouse-god in his sacred corner of the hut. Meanwhile the housewife, who had nursed thebear, sat by herself, silent and sad, bursting now and then into tears. Her grief was obviouslyunaffected, and it deepened as the festival went on. Next, the master of the house and someof the guests went out of the hut and offered libations before the bear’s cage. A few dropswere presented to the bear in a saucer, which he at once upset. Then the women and girlsdanced round the cage, their faces turned towards it, their knees slightly bent, rising and hop-ping on their toes. As they danced they clapped their hands and sang a monotonous song.The housewife and a few old women, who might have nursed many bears, danced tearfully,stretching out their arms to the bear, and addressing it in terms of endearment. The youngfolks were less affected; they laughed as well as sang. Disturbed by the noise, the bearbegan to rush about his cage and howl lamentably. Next libations were offered at the inao(inabos) or sacred wands which stand outside of an Aino hut. These wands are about a cou-ple of feet high, and are whittled at the top into spiral shavings. Five new wands with bambooleaves attached to them had been set up for the festival. This is regularly done when a bearis killed; the leaves mean that the animal may come to life again. Then the bear was let out ofhis cage, a rope was thrown round his neck, and he was led about in the neighbourhood ofthe hut. While this was being done the men, headed by a chief, shot at the beast with arrowstipped with wooden buttons. Dr. Scheube had to do so also. Then the bear was taken beforethe sacred wands, a stick was put in his mouth, nine men knelt on him and pressed his neckagainst a beam. In five minutes the animal had expired without uttering a sound. Meantimethe women and girls had taken post behind the men, where they danced, lamenting, andbeating the men who were killing the bear. The bear’s carcase was next placed on the matbefore the sacred wands; and a sword and quiver, taken from the wands, were hung roundthe beast’s neck. Being a she-bear, it was also adorned with a necklace and ear-rings. Thenfood and drink were offered to it, in the shape of millet-broth, millet-cakes, and a pot of sake.The men now sat down on mats before the dead bear, offered libations to it, and drank deep.Meanwhile the women and girls had laid aside all marks of sorrow, and danced merrily, nonemore merrily than the old women. When the mirth was at its height two young Aino, who hadlet the bear out of his cage, mounted the roof of the hut and threw cakes of millet among thecompany, who all scrambled for them without distinction of age or sex. The bear was nextskinned and disembowelled, and the trunk severed from the head, to which the skin was lefthanging. The blood, caught in cups, was eagerly swallowed by the men. None of the womenor children appeared to drink the blood, though custom did not forbid them to do so. The liverwas cut in small pieces and eaten raw, with salt, the women and children getting their share.The flesh and the rest of the vitals were taken into the house to be kept till the next day butone, and then to be divided among the persons who had been present at the feast. Blood andliver were offered to Dr. Scheube. While the bear was being disembowelled, the women andgirls danced the same dance which they had danced at the beginning—not, however, roundthe cage, but in front of the sacred wands. At this dance the old women, who had been merrya moment before, again shed tears freely. After the brain had been extracted from the bear’shead and swallowed with salt, the skull, detached from the skin, was hung on a pole besidethe sacred wands. The stick with which the bear had been gagged was also fastened to thepole, and so were the sword and quiver which had been hung on the carcase. The latter wereremoved in about an hour, but the rest remained standing. The whole company, men andPage 392"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"women, danced noisily before the pole; and another drinking-bout, in which the womenjoined, closed the festival.Perhaps the first published account of the bear-feast of the Aino is one which was given tothe world by a Japanese writer in 1652. It has been translated into French and runs thus:“When they find a young bear, they bring it home, and the wife suckles it. When it is grownthey feed it with fish and fowl and kill it in winter for the sake of the liver, which they esteeman antidote to poison, the worms, colic, and disorders of the stomach. It is of a very bittertaste, and is good for nothing if the bear has been killed in summer. This butchery begins inthe first Japanese month. For this purpose they put the animal’s head between two longpoles, which are squeezed together by fifty or sixty people, both men and women. When thebear is dead they eat his flesh, keep the liver as a medicine, and sell the skin, which is blackand commonly six feet long, but the longest measure twelve feet. As soon as he is skinned,the persons who nourished the beast begin to bewail him; afterwards they make little cakes toregale those who helped them.”The Aino of Saghalien rear bear cubs and kill them with similar ceremonies. We are told thatthey do not look upon the bear as a god but only as a messenger whom they despatch withvarious commissions to the god of the forest. The animal is kept for about two years in acage, and then killed at a festival, which always takes place in winter and at night. The daybefore the sacrifice is devoted to lamentation, old women relieving each other in the duty ofweeping and groaning in front of the bear’s cage. Then about the middle of the night or veryearly in the morning an orator makes a long speech to the beast, reminding him how theyhave taken care of him, and fed him well, and bathed him in the river, and made him warmand comfortable. “Now,” he proceeds, “we are holding a great festival in your honour. Be notafraid. We will not hurt you. We will only kill you and send you to the god of the forest wholoves you. We are about to offer you a good dinner, the best you have ever eaten among us,and we will all weep for you together. The Aino who will kill you is the best shot among us.There he is, he weeps and asks your forgiveness; you will feel almost nothing, it will be doneso quickly. We cannot feed you always, as you will understand. We have done enough foryou; it is now your turn to sacrifice yourself for us. You will ask God to send us, for the winter,plenty of otters and sables, and for the summer, seals and fish in abundance. Do not forgetour messages, we love you much, and our children will never forget you.” When the bear haspartaken of his last meal amid the general emotion of the spectators, the old women weepingafresh and the men uttering stifled cries, he is strapped, not without difficulty and danger, andbeing let out of the cage is led on leash or dragged, according to the state of his temper,thrice round his cage, then round his master’s house, and lastly round the house of the ora-tor. Thereupon he is tied up to a tree, which is decked with sacred whittled sticks (inao) of theusual sort; and the orator again addresses him in a long harangue, which sometimes lasts tillthe day is beginning to break. “Remember,” he cries, “remember! I remind you of your wholelife and of the services we have rendered you. It is now for you to do your duty. Do not forgetwhat I have asked of you. You will tell the gods to give us riches, that our hunters may returnfrom the forest laden with rare furs and animals good to eat; that our fishers may find troopsof seals on the shore and in the sea, and that their nets may crack under the weight of thefish. We have no hope but in you. The evil spirits laugh at us, and too often they areunfavourable and malignant to us, but they will bow before you. We have given you food andjoy and health; now we kill you in order that you may in return send riches to us and to ourchildren.” To this discourse the bear, more and more surly and agitated, listens without con-viction; round and round the tree he paces and howls lamentably, till, just as the first beamsof the rising sun light up the scene, an archer speeds an arrow to his heart. No sooner has hePage 393"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"done so, than the marksman throws away his bow and flings himself on the ground, and theold men and women do the same, weeping and sobbing. Then they offer the dead beast arepast of rice and wild potatoes, and having spoken to him in terms of pity and thanked himfor what he has done and suffered, they cut off his head and paws and keep them as sacredthings. A banquet on the flesh and blood of the bear follows. Women were formerly excludedfrom it, but now they share with the men. The blood is drunk warm by all present; the flesh isboiled, custom forbids it to be roasted. And as the relics of the bear may not enter the houseby the door, and Aino houses in Saghalien have no windows, a man gets up on the roof andlets the flesh, the head, and the skin down through the smoke-hole. Rice and wild potatoesare then offered to the head, and a pipe, tobacco, and matches are considerately placedbeside it. Custom requires that the guests should eat up the whole animal before they depart;the use of salt and pepper at the meal is forbidden; and no morsel of the flesh may be givento the dogs. When the banquet is over, the head is carried away into the depth of the forestand deposited on a heap of bears’ skulls, the bleached and mouldering relics of similar festi-vals in the past.The Gilyaks, a Tunguzian people of Eastern Siberia, hold a bear-festival of the same sortonce a year in January. “The bear is the object of the most refined solicitude of an entire vil-lage and plays the chief part in their religious ceremonies.” An old she-bear is shot and hercub is reared, but not suckled, in the village. When the bear is big enough he is taken fromhis cage and dragged through the village. But first they lead him to the bank of the river, forthis is believed to ensure abundance of fish to each family. He is then taken into every housein the village, where fish, brandy, and so forth are offered to him. Some people prostratethemselves before the beast. His entrance into a house is supposed to bring a blessing; andif he snuffs at the food offered to him, this also is a blessing. Nevertheless they tease andworry, poke and tickle the animal continually, so that he is surly and snappish. After beingthus taken to every house, he is tied to a peg and shot dead with arrows. His head is then cutoff, decked with shavings, and placed on the table where the feast is set out. Here they begpardon of the beast and worship him. Then his flesh is roasted and eaten in special vesselsof wood finely carved. They do not eat the flesh raw nor drink the blood, as the Aino do. Thebrain and entrails are eaten last; and the skull, still decked with shavings, is placed on a treenear the house. Then the people sing and both sexes dance in ranks, as bears.One of these bear-festivals was witnessed by the Russian traveller L. von Schrenck and hiscompanions at the Gilyak village of Tebach in January 1856. From his detailed report of theceremony we may gather some particulars which are not noticed in the briefer accountswhich I have just summarised. The bear, he tells us, plays a great part in the life of all thepeoples inhabiting the region of the Amoor and Siberia as far as Kamtchatka, but amongnone of them is his importance greater than among the Gilyaks. The immense size which theanimal attains in the valley of the Amoor, his ferocity whetted by hunger, and the frequency ofhis appearance, all combine to make him the most dreaded beast of prey in the country. Nowonder, therefore, that the fancy of the Gilyaks is busied with him and surrounds him, both inlife and in death, with a sort of halo of superstitious fear. Thus, for example, it is thought thatif a Gilyak falls in combat with a bear, his soul transmigrates into the body of the beast.Nevertheless his flesh has an irresistible attraction for the Gilyak palate, especially when theanimal has been kept in captivity for some time and fattened on fish, which gives the flesh, inthe opinion of the Gilyaks, a peculiarly delicious flavour. But in order to enjoy this dainty withimpunity they deem it needful to perform a long series of ceremonies, of which the intention isto delude the living bear by a show of respect, and to appease the anger of the dead animalby the homage paid to his departed spirit. The marks of respect begin as soon as the beast isPage 394"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"captured. He is brought home in triumph and kept in a cage, where all the villagers take it inturns to feed him. For although he may have been captured or purchased by one man, hebelongs in a manner to the whole village. His flesh will furnish a common feast, and hence allmust contribute to support him in his life. The length of time he is kept in captivity depends onhis age. Old bears are kept only a few months; cubs are kept till they are full-grown. A thicklayer of fat on the captive bear gives the signal for the festival, which is always held in winter,generally in December but sometimes in January or February. At the festival witnessed by theRussian travellers, which lasted a good many days, three bears were killed and eaten. Morethan once the animals were led about in procession and compelled to enter every house inthe village, where they were fed as a mark of honour, and to show that they were welcomeguests. But before the beasts set out on this round of visits, the Gilyaks played at skipping-rope in presence, and perhaps, as L. von Schrenck inclined to believe, in honour of the ani-mals. The night before they were killed, the three bears were led by moonlight a long way onthe ice of the frozen river. That night no one in the village might sleep. Next day, after the ani-mals had been again led down the steep bank to the river, and conducted thrice round thehole in the ice from which the women of the village drew their water, they were taken to anappointed place not far from the village, and shot to death with arrows. The place of sacrificeor execution was marked as holy by being surrounded with whittled sticks, from the tops ofwhich shavings hung in curls. Such sticks are with the Gilyaks, as with the Aino, the regularsymbols that accompany all religious ceremonies.When the house has been arranged and decorated for their reception, the skins of the bears,with their heads attached to them, are brought into it, not, however, by the door, but through awindow, and then hung on a sort of scaffold opposite the hearth on which the flesh is to becooked. The boiling of the bears’ flesh among the Gilyaks is done only by the oldest men,whose high privilege it is; women and children, young men and boys have no part in it. Thetask is performed slowly and deliberately, with a certain solemnity. On the occasion describedby the Russian travellers the kettle was first of all surrounded with a thick wreath of shavings,and then filled with snow, for the use of water to cook bear’s flesh is forbidden. Meanwhile alarge wooden trough, richly adorned with arabesques and carvings of all sorts, was hungimmediately under the snouts of the bears; on one side of the trough was carved in relief abear, on the other side a toad. When the carcases were being cut up, each leg was laid onthe ground in front of the bears, as if to ask their leave, before being placed in the kettle; andthe boiled flesh was fished out of the kettle with an iron hook, and set in the trough before thebears, in order that they might be the first to taste of their own flesh. As fast, too, as the fatwas cut in strips it was hung up in front of the bears, and afterwards laid in a small woodentrough on the ground before them. Last of all the inner organs of the beasts were cut up andplaced in small vessels. At the same time the women made bandages out of parti-colouredrags, and after sunset these bandages were tied round the bears’ snouts just below the eyes“in order to dry the tears that flowed from them.”As soon as the ceremony of wiping away poor bruin’s tears had been performed, the assem-bled Gilyaks set to work in earnest to devour his flesh. The broth obtained by boiling the meathad already been partaken of. The wooden bowls, platters, and spoons out of which theGilyaks eat the broth and flesh of the bears on these occasions are always made specially forthe purpose at the festival and only then; they are elaborately ornamented with carved figuresof bears and other devices that refer to the animal or the festival, and the people have astrong superstitious scruple against parting with them. After the bones had been picked cleanthey were put back in the kettle in which the flesh had been boiled. And when the festal mealwas over, an old man took his stand at the door of the house with a branch of fir in his hand,Page 395"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"with which, as the people passed out, he gave a light blow to every one who had eaten of thebear’s flesh or fat, perhaps as a punishment for their treatment of the worshipful animal. Inthe afternoon the women performed a strange dance. Only one woman danced at a time,throwing the upper part of her body into the oddest postures, while she held in her hands abranch of fir or a kind of wooden castanets. The other women meanwhile played an accom-paniment by drumming on the beams of the house with clubs. Von Schrenk believed that afterthe flesh of the bear has been eaten the bones and the skull are solemnly carried out by theoldest people to a place in the forest not far from the village. There all the bones except theskull are buried. After that a young tree is felled a few inches above the ground, its stumpcleft, and the skull wedged into the cleft. When the grass grows over the spot, the skull disap-pears from view, and that is the end of the bear.Another description of the bear-festivals of the Gilyaks has been given us by Mr. LeoSternberg. It agrees substantially with the foregoing accounts, but a few particulars in it maybe noted. According to Mr. Sternberg, the festival is usually held in honour of a deceasedrelation: the next of kin either buys or catches a bear cub and nurtures it for two or threeyears till it is ready for the sacrifice. Only certain distinguished guests (Narch-en) are privi-leged to partake of the bear’s flesh, but the host and members of his clan eat a broth madefrom the flesh; great quantities of this broth are prepared and consumed on the occasion. Theguests of honour (Narch-en) must belong to the clan into which the host’s daughters and theother women of his clan are married: one of these guests, usually the host’s son-in-law, isentrusted with the duty of shooting the bear dead with an arrow. The skin, head, and flesh ofthe slain bear are brought into the house not through the door but through the smoke-hole; aquiver full of arrows is laid under the head and beside it are deposited tobacco, sugar, andother food. The soul of the bear is supposed to carry off the souls of these things with it onthe far journey. A special vessel is used for cooking the bear’s flesh, and the fire must be kin-dled by a sacred apparatus of flint and steel, which belongs to the clan and is handed downfrom generation to generation, but which is never used to light fires except on these solemnoccasions. Of all the many viands cooked for the consumption of the assembled people aportion is placed in a special vessel and set before the bear’s head: this is called “feeding thehead.” After the bear has been killed, dogs are sacrificed in couples of male and female.Before being throttled, they are fed and invited to go to their lord on the highest mountain, tochange their skins, and to return next year in the form of bears. The soul of the dead beardeparts to the same lord, who is also lord of the primaeval forest; it goes away laden with theofferings that have been made to it, and attended by the souls of the dogs and also by thesouls of the sacred whittled sticks, which figure prominently at the festival.The Goldi, neighbours of the Gilyaks, treat the bear in much the same way. They hunt and killit; but sometimes they capture a live bear and keep him in a cage, feeding him well and call-ing him their son and brother. Then at a great festival he is taken from his cage, paradedabout with marked consideration, and afterwards killed and eaten. “The skull, jaw-bones, andears are then suspended on a tree, as an antidote against evil spirits; but the flesh is eatenand much relished, for they believe that all who partake of it acquire a zest for the chase, andbecome courageous.”The Orotchis, another Tunguzian people of the region of the Amoor, hold bear-festivals of thesame general character. Any one who catches a bear cub considers it his bounden duty torear it in a cage for about three years, in order at the end of that time to kill it publicly and eatthe flesh with his friends. The feasts being public, though organised by individuals, the peopletry to have one in each Orotchi village every year in turn. When the bear is taken out of hisPage 396"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"cage, he is led about by means of ropes to all the huts, accompanied by people armed withlances, bows, and arrows. At each hut the bear and bear-leaders are treated to somethinggood to eat and drink. This goes on for several days until all the huts, not only in that villagebut also in the next, have been visited. The days are given up to sport and noisy jollity. Thenthe bear is tied to a tree or wooden pillar and shot to death by the arrows of the crowd, afterwhich its flesh is roasted and eaten. Among the Orotchis of the Tundja River women take partin the bear-feasts, while among the Orotchis of the River Vi the women will not even touchbear’s flesh.In the treatment of the captive bear by these tribes there are features which can hardly bedistinguished from worship. Such, for example, are the prayers offered to it both alive anddead; the offerings of food, including portions of its own flesh, laid before the animal’s skull;and the Gilyak custom of leading the living beast to the river in order to ensure a supply offish, and of conducting him from house to house in order that every family may receive hisblessing, just as in Europe a May-tree or a personal representative of the tree-spirit used tobe taken from door to door in spring for the sake of diffusing among all and sundry the freshenergies of reviving nature. Again, the solemn participation in his flesh and blood, and partic-ularly the Aino custom of sharing the contents of the cup which had been consecrated bybeing set before the dead beast, are strongly suggestive of a sacrament, and the suggestionis confirmed by the Gilyak practice of reserving special vessels to hold the flesh and cookingit on a fire kindled by a sacred apparatus which is never employed except on these religiousoccasions. Indeed our principal authority on Aino religion, the Rev. John Batchelor, franklydescribes as worship the ceremonious respect which the Aino pay to the bear, and he affirmsthat the animal is undoubtedly one of their gods. Certainly the Aino appear to apply theirname for god (kamui) freely to the bear; but, as Mr. Batchelor himself points out, that word isused with many different shades of meaning and is applied to a great variety of objects, sothat from its application to the bear we cannot safely argue that the animal is actually regard-ed as a deity. Indeed we are expressly told that the Aino of Saghalien do not consider thebear to be a god but only a messenger to the gods, and the message with which they chargethe animal at its death bears out the statement. Apparently the Gilyaks also look on the bearin the light of an envoy despatched with presents to the Lord of the Mountain, on whom thewelfare of the people depends. At the same time they treat the animal as a being of a higherorder than man, in fact as a minor deity, whose presence in the village, so long as he is keptand fed, diffuses blessings, especially by keeping at bay the swarms of evil spirits who areconstantly lying in wait for people, stealing their goods and destroying their bodies by sick-ness and disease. Moreover, by partaking of the flesh, blood, or broth of the bear, theGilyaks, the Aino, and the Goldi are all of opinion that they acquire some portion of the ani-mal’s mighty powers, particularly his courage and strength. No wonder, therefore, that theyshould treat so great a benefactor with marks of the highest respect and affection.Some light may be thrown on the ambiguous attitude of the Aino to bears by comparing thesimilar treatment which they accord to other creatures. For example, they regard the eagle-owl as a good deity who by his hooting warns men of threatened evil and defends themagainst it; hence he is loved, trusted, and devoutly worshipped as a divine mediator betweenmen and the Creator. The various names applied to him are significant both of his divinity andof his mediatorship. Whenever an opportunity offers, one of these divine birds is captured andkept in a cage, where he is greeted with the endearing titles of “Beloved god” and “Dear littledivinity.” Nevertheless the time comes when the dear little divinity is throttled and sent awayin his capacity of mediator to take a message to the superior gods or to the Creator himself.The following is the form of prayer addressed to the eagle-owl when it is about to be sacri-ficed: “Beloved deity, we have brought you up because we loved you, and now we are aboutPage 397"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"to send you to your father. We herewith offer you food, inao, wine, and cakes; take them toyour parent, and he will be very pleased. When you come to him say, ‘I have lived a long timeamong the Ainu, where an Ainu father and an Ainu mother reared me. I now come to thee. Ihave brought a variety of good things. I saw while living in Ainuland a great deal of distress. Iobserved that some of the people were possessed by demons, some were wounded by wildanimals, some were hurt by landslides, others suffered shipwreck, and many were attackedby disease. The people are in great straits. My father, hear me, and hasten to look upon theAinu and help them.’ If you do this, your father will help us.”Again, the Aino keep eagles in cages, worship them as divinities, and ask them to defend thepeople from evil. Yet they offer the bird in sacrifice, and when they are about to do so theypray to him, saying: “O precious divinity, O thou divine bird, pray listen to my words. Thoudost not belong to this world, for thy home is with the Creator and his golden eagles. Thisbeing so, I present thee with these inao and cakes and other precious things. Do thou rideupon the inao and ascend to thy home in the glorious heavens. When thou arrivest, assemblethe deities of thy own kind together and thank them for us for having governed the world. Dothou come again, I beseech thee, and rule over us. O my precious one, go thou quietly.”Once more, the Aino revere hawks, keep them in cages, and offer them in sacrifice. At thetime of killing one of them the following prayer should be addressed to the bird: “O divinehawk, thou art an expert hunter, please cause thy cleverness to descend on me.” If a hawk iswell treated in captivity and prayed to after this fashion when he is about to be killed, he willsurely send help to the hunter.Thus the Aino hopes to profit in various ways by slaughtering the creatures, which, neverthe-less, he treats as divine. He expects them to carry messages for him to their kindred or to thegods in the upper world; he hopes to partake of their virtues by swallowing parts of their bod-ies or in other ways; and apparently he looks forward to their bodily resurrection in this world,which will enable him again to catch and kill them, and again to reap all the benefits which hehas already derived from their slaughter. For in the prayers addressed to the worshipful bearand the worshipful eagle before they are knocked on the head the creatures are invited tocome again, which seems clearly to point to a faith in their future resurrection. If any doubtcould exist on this head, it would be dispelled by the evidence of Mr. Batchelor, who tells usthat the Aino “are firmly convinced that the spirits of birds and animals killed in hunting oroffered in sacrifice come and live again upon the earth clothed with a body; and they believe,further, that they appear here for the special benefit of men, particularly Ainu hunters.” TheAino, Mr. Batchelor tells us, “confessedly slays and eats the beast that another may come inits place and be treated in like manner”; and at the time of sacrificing the creatures “prayersare said to them which form a request that they will come again and furnish viands for anoth-er feast, as if it were an honour to them to be thus killed and eaten, and a pleasure as well.Indeed such is the people’s idea.” These last observations, as the context shows, refer espe-cially to the sacrifice of bears.Thus among the benefits which the Aino anticipates from the slaughter of the worshipful ani-mals not the least substantial is that of gorging himself on their flesh and blood, both on thepresent and on many a similar occasion hereafter; and that pleasing prospect again isderived from his firm faith in the spiritual immortality and bodily resurrection of the dead ani-mals. A like faith is shared by many savage hunters in many parts of the world and has givenrise to a variety of quaint customs, some of which will be described presently. Meantime it isnot unimportant to observe that the solemn festivals at which the Aino, the Gilyaks, and othertribes slaughter the tame caged bears with demonstrations of respect and sorrow, are proba-Page 398"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"bly nothing but an extension or glorification of similar rites which the hunter performs over anywild bear which he chances to kill in the forest. Indeed with regard to the Gilyaks we areexpressly informed that this is the case. If we would understand the meaning of the Gilyak rit-ual, says Mr. Sternberg, “we must above all remember that the bear-festivals are not, as isusually but falsely assumed, celebrated only at the killing of a house-bear but are held onevery occasion when a Gilyak succeeds in slaughtering a bear in the chase. It is true that insuch cases the festival assumes less imposing dimensions, but in its essence it remains thesame. When the head and skin of a bear killed in the forest are brought into the village, theyare accorded a triumphal reception with music and solemn ceremonial. The head is laid on aconsecrated scaffold, fed, and treated with offerings, just as at the killing of a house-bear; andthe guests of honour (Narch-en) are also assembled. So, too, dogs are sacrificed, and thebones of the bear are preserved in the same place and with the same marks of respect asthe bones of a house-bear. Hence the great winter festival is only an extension of the ritewhich is observed at the slaughter of every bear.”Thus the apparent contradiction in the practice of these tribes, who venerate and almost deifythe animals which they habitually hunt, kill, and eat, is not so flagrant as at first sight itappears to us: the people have reasons, and some very practical reasons, for acting as theydo. For the savage is by no means so illogical and unpractical as to superficial observers heis apt to seem; he has thought deeply on the questions which immediately concern him, hereasons about them, and though his conclusions often diverge very widely from ours, weought not to deny him the credit of patient and prolonged meditation on some fundamentalproblems of human existence. In the present case, if he treats bears in general as creatureswholly subservient to human needs and yet singles out certain individuals of the species forhomage which almost amounts to deification, we must not hastily set him down as irrationaland inconsistent, but must endeavour to place ourselves at his point of view, to see things ashe sees them, and to divest ourselves of the prepossessions which tinge so deeply our ownviews of the world. If we do so, we shall probably discover that, however absurd his conductmay appear to us, the savage nevertheless generally acts on a train of reasoning whichseems to him in harmony with the facts of his limited experience. This I propose to illustrate inthe following chapter, where I shall attempt to show that the solemn ceremonial of the bear-festival among the Ainos and other tribes of North-eastern Asia is only a particularly strikingexample of the respect which on the principles of his rude philosophy the savage habituallypays to the animals which he kills and eats.Chapter LIIIThe Propitiation of Wild Animals by HuntersTHE explanation of life by the theory of an indwelling and practically immortal soul is onewhich the savage does not confine to human beings but extends to the animate creation ingeneral. In so doing he is more liberal and perhaps more logical than the civilised man, whocommonly denies to animals that privilege of immortality which he claims for himself. The sav-age is not so proud; he commonly believes that animals are endowed with feelings and intelli-gence like those of men, and that, like men, they possess souls which survive the death oftheir bodies either to wander about as disembodied spirits or to be born again in animal form.Thus to the savage, who regards all living creatures as practically on a footing of equality withman, the act of killing and eating an animal must wear a very different aspect from that whichthe same act presents to us, who regard the intelligence of animals as far inferior to our ownand deny them the possession of immortal souls. Hence on the principles of his rude philoso-Page 399"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"phy the primitive hunter who slays an animal believes himself exposed to the vengeanceeither of its disembodied spirit or of all the other animals of the same species, whom he con-siders as knit together, like men, by the ties of kin and the obligations of the blood feud, andtherefore as bound to resent the injury done to one of their number. Accordingly the savagemakes it a rule to spare the life of those animals which he has no pressing motive for killing,at least such fierce and dangerous animals as are likely to exact a bloody vengeance for theslaughter of one of their kind. Crocodiles are animals of this sort. They are only found in hotcountries, where, as a rule, food is abundant and primitive man has therefore little reason tokill them for the sake of their tough and unpalatable flesh. Hence it is a custom with somesavages to spare crocodiles, or rather only to kill them in obedience to the law of blood feud,that is, as a retaliation for the slaughter of men by crocodiles. For example, the Dyaks ofBorneo will not kill a crocodile unless a crocodile has first killed a man. “For why, say they,should they commit an act of aggression, when he and his kindred can so easily repay them?But should the alligator take a human life, revenge becomes a sacred duty of the living rela-tives, who will trap the man-eater in the spirit of an officer of justice pursuing a criminal.Others, even then, hang back, reluctant to embroil themselves in a quarrel which does notconcern them. The man-eating alligator is supposed to be pursued by a righteous Nemesis;and whenever one is caught they have a profound conviction that it must be the guilty one, orhis accomplice.”Like the Dyaks, the natives of Madagascar never kill a crocodile “except in retaliation for oneof their friends who has been destroyed by a crocodile. They believe that the wanton destruc-tion of one of these reptiles will be followed by the loss of human life, in accordance with theprinciple of lex talionis.” The people who live near the lake Itasy in Madagascar make a yearlyproclamation to the crocodiles, announcing that they will revenge the death of some of theirfriends by killing as many crocodiles in return, and warning all well-disposed crocodiles tokeep out of the way, as they have no quarrel with them, but only with their evil-minded rela-tions who have taken human life. Various tribes of Madagascar believe themselves to bedescended from crocodiles, and accordingly they view the scaly reptile as, to all intents andpurposes, a man and a brother. If one of the animals should so far forget himself as to devourone of his human kinsfolk, the chief of the tribe, or in his absence an old man familiar with thetribal customs, repairs at the head of the people to the edge of the water, and summons thefamily of the culprit to deliver him up to the arm of justice. A hook is then baited and cast intothe river or lake. Next day the guilty brother, or one of his family, is dragged ashore, and afterhis crime has been clearly brought home to him by a strict interrogation, he is sentenced todeath and executed. The claims of justice being thus satisfied and the majesty of the law fullyvindicated, the deceased crocodile is lamented and buried like a kinsman; a mound is raisedover his relics and a stone marks the place of his head.Again, the tiger is another of those dangerous beasts whom the savage prefers to leavealone, lest by killing one of the species he should excite the hostility of the rest. No considera-tion will induce a Sumatran to catch or wound a tiger except in self-defence or immediatelyafter a tiger has destroyed a friend or relation. When a European has set traps for tigers, thepeople of the neighbourhood have been known to go by night to the place and explain to theanimals that the traps are not set by them nor with their consent. The inhabitants of the hillsnear Rajamahall, in Bengal, are very averse to killing a tiger, unless one of their kinsfolk hasbeen carried off by one of the beasts. In that case they go out for the purpose of hunting andslaying a tiger; and when they have succeeded they lay their bows and arrows on the car-case and invoke God, declaring that they slew the animal in retaliation for the loss of a kins-man. Vengeance having been thus taken, they swear not to attack another tiger except underPage 400"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"similar provocation.The Indians of Carolina would not molest snakes when they came upon them, but would passby on the other side of the path, believing that if they were to kill a serpent, the reptile’s kin-dred would destroy some of their brethren, friends, or relations in return. So the SeminoleIndians spared the rattlesnake, because they feared that the soul of the dead rattlesnakewould incite its kinsfolk to take vengeance. The Cherokee regard the rattlesnake as the chiefof the snake tribe and fear and respect him accordingly. Few Cherokee will venture to kill arattlesnake, unless they cannot help it, and even then they must atone for the crime by crav-ing pardon of the snake’s ghost either in their own person or through the mediation of apriest, according to a set formula. If these precautions are neglected, the kinsfolk of the deadsnake will send one of their number as an avenger of blood, who will track down the murdererand sting him to death. No ordinary Cherokee dares to kill a wolf, if he can possibly help it; forhe believes that the kindred of the slain beast would surely avenge its death, and that theweapon with which the deed had been done would be quite useless for the future, unless itwere cleaned and exorcised by a medicine-man. However, certain persons who know theproper rites of atonement for such a crime can kill wolves with impunity, and they are some-times hired to do so by people who have suffered from the raids of the wolves on their cattleor fish-traps. In Jebel-Nuba, a district of the Eastern Sudan, it is forbidden to touch the nestsor remove the young of a species of black birds, resembling our blackbirds, because the peo-ple believe that the parent birds would avenge the wrong by causing a stormy wind to blow,which would destroy the harvest.But the savage clearly cannot afford to spare all animals. He must either eat some of them orstarve, and when the question thus comes to be whether he or the animal must perish, he isforced to overcome his superstitious scruples and take the life of the beast. At the same timehe does all he can to appease his victims and their kinsfolk. Even in the act of killing them hetestifies his respect for them, endeavours to excuse or even conceal his share in procuringtheir death, and promises that their remains will be honourably treated. By thus robbing deathof its terrors, he hopes to reconcile his victims to their fate and to induce their fellows to comeand be killed also. For example, it was a principle with the Kamtchatkans never to kill a landor sea animal without first making excuses to it and begging that the animal would not take itill. Also they offered it cedarnuts and so forth, to make it think that it was not a victim but aguest at a feast. They believed that this hindered other animals of the same species fromgrowing shy. For instance, after they had killed a bear and feasted on its flesh, the host wouldbring the bear’s head before the company, wrap it in grass, and present it with a variety of tri-fles. Then he would lay the blame of the bear’s death on the Russians, and bid the beastwreak his wrath upon them. Also he would ask the bear to inform the other bears how well hehad been treated, that they too might come without fear. Seals, sea-lions, and other animalswere treated by the Kamtchatkans with the same ceremonious respect. Moreover, they usedto insert sprigs of a plant resembling bear’s wort in the mouths of the animals they killed; afterwhich they would exhort the grinning skulls to have no fear but to go and tell it to their fellows,that they also might come and be caught and so partake of this splendid hospitality. When theOstiaks have hunted and killed a bear, they cut off its head and hang it on a tree. Then theygather round in a circle and pay it divine honours. Next they run towards the carcase utteringlamentations and saying, “Who killed you? It was the Russians. Who cut off your head? Itwas a Russian axe. Who skinned you? It was a knife made by a Russian.” They explain, too,that the feathers which sped the arrow on its flight came from the wing of a strange bird, andthat they did nothing but let the arrow go. They do all this because they believe that the wan-dering ghost of the slain bear would attack them on the first opportunity, if they did not thusPage 401"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"appease it. Or they stuff the skin of the slain bear with hay; and after celebrating their victorywith songs of mockery and insult, after spitting on and kicking it, they set it up on its hindlegs, “and then, for a considerable time, they bestow on it all the veneration due to a guardiangod.” When a party of Koryak have killed a bear or a wolf, they skin the beast and dress oneof themselves in the skin. Then they dance round the skin-clad man, saying that it was notthey who killed the animal, but some one else, generally a Russian. When they kill a fox theyskin it, wrap the body in grass, and bid him go tell his companions how hospitably he hasbeen received, and how he has received a new cloak instead of his old one. A fuller accountof the Koryak ceremonies is given by a more recent writer. He tells us that when a dead bearis brought to the house, the women come out to meet it, dancing with firebrands. The bear-skin is taken off along with the head; and one of the women puts on the skin, dances in it,and entreats the bear not to be angry, but to be kind to the people. At the same time theyoffer meat on a wooden platter to the dead beast, saying, “Eat, friend.” Afterwards a ceremo-ny is performed for the purpose of sending the dead bear, or rather his spirit, away back tohis home. He is provided with provisions for the journey in the shape of puddings or reindeer-flesh packed in a grass bag. His skin is stuffed with grass and carried round the house, afterwhich he is supposed to depart towards the rising sun. The intention of the ceremonies is toprotect the people from the wrath of the slain bear and his kinsfolk, and so to ensure successin future bear-hunts. The Finns used to try to persuade a slain bear that he had not beenkilled by them, but had fallen from a tree, or met his death in some other way; moreover, theyheld a funeral festival in his honour, at the close of which bards expatiated on the homagethat had been paid to him, urging him to report to the other bears the high consideration withwhich he had been treated, in order that they also, following his example, might come and beslain. When the Lapps had succeeded in killing a bear with impunity, they thanked him for nothurting them and for not breaking the clubs and spears which had given him his deathwounds; and they prayed that he would not visit his death upon them by sending storms or inany other way. His flesh then furnished a feast.The reverence of hunters for the bear whom they regularly kill and eat may thus be traced allalong the northern region of the Old World from Bering’s Straits to Lappland. It reappears insimilar forms in North America. With the American Indians a bear hunt was an importantevent for which they prepared by long fasts and purgations. Before setting out they offeredexpiatory sacrifices to the souls of bears slain in previous hunts, and besought them to befavourable to the hunters. When a bear was killed the hunter lit his pipe, and putting themouth of it between the bear’s lips, blew into the bowl, filling the beast’s mouth with smoke.Then he begged the bear not to be angry at having been killed, and not to thwart him after-wards in the chase. The carcase was roasted whole and eaten; not a morsel of the fleshmight be left over. The head, painted red and blue, was hung on a post and addressed byorators, who heaped praise on the dead beast. When men of the Bear clan in the Ottawatribe killed a bear, they made him a feast of his own flesh, and addressed him thus: “Cherishus no grudge because we have killed you. You have sense; you see that our children arehungry. They love you and wish to take you into their bodies. Is it not glorious to be eaten bythe children of a chief?” Amongst the Nootka Indians of British Columbia, when a bear hadbeen killed, it was brought in and seated before the head chief in an upright posture, with achief’s bonnet, wrought in figures, on its head, and its fur powdered over with white down. Atray of provisions was then set before it, and it was invited by words and gestures to eat. Afterthat the animal was skinned, boiled, and eaten.Alike respect is testified for other dangerous creatures by the hunters who regularly trap andkill them. When Caffre hunters are in the act of showering spears on an elephant, they callPage 402"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"out, “Don’t kill us, great captain; don’t strike or tread upon us, mighty chief.” When he is deadthey make their excuses to him, pretending that his death was a pure accident. As a mark ofrespect they bury his trunk with much solemn ceremony; for they say that “the elephant is agreat lord; his trunk is his hand.” Before the Amaxosa Caffres attack an elephant they shoutto the animal and beg him to pardon them for the slaughter they are about to perpetrate, pro-fessing great submission to his person and explaining clearly the need they have of his tusksto enable them to procure beads and supply their wants. When they have killed him they buryin the ground, along with the end of his trunk, a few of the articles they have obtained for theivory, thus hoping to avert some mishap that would otherwise befall them. Amongst sometribes of Eastern Africa, when a lion is killed, the carcase is brought before the king, who doeshomage to it by prostrating himself on the ground and rubbing his face on the muzzle of thebeast. In some parts of Western Africa if a negro kills a leopard he is bound fast and broughtbefore the chiefs for having killed one of their peers. The man defends himself on the pleathat the leopard is chief of the forest and therefore a stranger. He is then set at liberty andrewarded. But the dead leopard, adorned with a chief’s bonnet, is set up in the village, wherenightly dances are held in its honour. The Baganda greatly fear the ghosts of buffaloes whichthey have killed, and they always appease these dangerous spirits. On no account will theybring the head of a slain buffalo into a village or into a garden of plantains: they always eatthe flesh of the head in the open country. Afterwards they place the skull in a small hut builtfor the purpose, where they pour out beer as an offering and pray to the ghost to stay wherehe is and not to harm them.Another formidable beast whose life the savage hunter takes with joy, yet with fear and trem-bling, is the whale. After the slaughter of a whale the maritime Koryak of North-easternSiberia hold a communal festival, the essential part of which “is based on the conception thatthe whale killed has come on a visit to the village; that it is staying for some time, duringwhich it is treated with great respect; that it then returns to the sea to repeat its visit the fol-lowing year; that it will induce its relatives to come along, telling them of the hospitable recep-tion that has been accorded to it. According to the Koryak ideas, the whales, like all other ani-mals, constitute one tribe, or rather family, of related individuals, who live in villages like theKoryak. They avenge the murder of one of their number, and are grateful for kindnesses thatthey may have received.” When the inhabitants of the Isle of St. Mary, to the north ofMadagascar, go a-whaling, they single out the young whales for attack and “humbly beg themother’s pardon, stating the necessity that drives them to kill her progeny, and requestingthat she will be pleased to go below while the deed is doing, that her maternal feelings maynot be outraged by witnessing what must cause her so much uneasiness.” An Ajumba hunterhaving killed a female hippopotamus on Lake Azyingo in West Africa, the animal was decapi-tated and its quarters and bowels removed. Then the hunter, naked, stepped into the hollowof the ribs, and kneeling down in the bloody pool washed his whole body with the blood andexcretions of the animal, while he prayed to the soul of the hippopotamus not to bear him agrudge for having killed her and so blighted her hopes of future maternity; and he furtherentreated the ghost not to stir up other hippopotamuses to avenge her death by butting atand capsizing his canoe.The ounce, a leopard-like creature, is dreaded for its depredations by the Indians of Brazil.When they have caught one of these animals in a snare, they kill it and carry the body hometo the village. There the women deck the carcase with feathers of many colours, put braceletson its legs, and weep over it, saying, “I pray thee not to take vengeance on our little ones forhaving been caught and killed through thine own ignorance. For it was not we who deceivedthee, it was thyself. Our husbands only set the trap to catch animals that are good to eat;Page 403"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"they never thought to take thee in it. Therefore, let not thy soul counsel thy fellows to avengethy death on our little ones!” When a Blackfoot Indian has caught eagles in a trap and killedthem, he takes them home to a special lodge, called the eagles’ lodge, which has been pre-pared for their reception outside of the camp. Here he sets the birds in a row on the ground,and propping up their heads on a stick, puts a piece of dried meat in each of their mouths inorder that the spirits of the dead eagles may go and tell the other eagles how well they arebeing treated by the Indians. So when Indian hunters of the Orinoco region have killed an ani-mal, they open its mouth and pour into it a few drops of the liquor they generally carry withthem, in order that the soul of the dead beast may inform its fellows of the welcome it hasmet with, and that they too, cheered by the prospect of the same kind reception, may comewith alacrity to be killed. When a Teton Indian is on a journey, and he meets a grey spider ora spider with yellow legs, he kills it, because some evil would befall him if he did not. But heis very careful not to let the spider know that he kills it, for if the spider knew, his soul wouldgo and tell the other spiders, and one of them would be sure to avenge the death of his rela-tion. So in crushing the insect, the Indian says, “O Grandfather Spider, the Thunder-beings killyou.” And the spider is crushed at once and believes what is told him. His soul probably runsand tells the other spiders that the Thunder-beings have killed him; but no harm comes ofthat. For what can grey or yellow-legged spiders do to the Thunder-beings?But it is not merely dangerous creatures with whom the savage desires to keep on goodterms. It is true that the respect which he pays to wild beasts is in some measure propor-tioned to their strength and ferocity. Thus the savage Stiens of Cambodia, believing that allanimals have souls which roam about after their death, beg an animal’s pardon when they killit, lest its soul should come and torment them. Also they offer it sacrifices, but these sacrificesare proportioned to the size and strength of the animal. The ceremonies which they observeat the death of an elephant are conducted with much pomp and last seven days. Similar dis-tinctions are drawn by North American Indians. “The bear, the buffalo, and the beaver aremanidos [divinities] which furnish food. The bear is formidable, and good to eat. They renderceremonies to him, begging him to allow himself to be eaten, although they know he has nofancy for it. We kill you, but you are not annihilated. His head and paws are objects of hom-age.... Other animals are treated similarly from similar reasons.... Many of the animalmanidos, not being dangerous, are often treated with contempt—the terrapin, the weasel,polecat, etc.” The distinction is instructive. Animals which are feared, or are good to eat, orboth, are treated with ceremonious respect; those which are neither formidable nor good toeat are despised. We have had examples of reverence paid to animals which are both fearedand eaten. It remains to prove that similar respect is shown to animals which, without beingfeared, are either eaten or valued for their skins.When Siberian sable-hunters have caught a sable, no one is allowed to see it, and they thinkthat if good or evil be spoken of the captured sable no more sables will be caught. A hunterhas been known to express his belief that the sables could hear what was said of them as faroff as Moscow. He said that the chief reason why the sable hunt was now so unproductivewas that some live sables had been sent to Moscow. There they had been viewed with aston-ishment as strange animals, and the sables cannot abide that. Another, though minor, causeof the diminished take of sables was, he alleged, that the world is now much worse than itused to be, so that nowadays a hunter will sometimes hide the sable which he has gotinstead of putting it into the common stock. This also, said he, the sables cannot abide.Alaskan hunters preserve the bones of sables and beavers out of reach of the dogs for a yearand then bury them carefully, “lest the spirits who look after the beavers and sables shouldconsider that they are regarded with contempt, and hence no more should be killed orPage 404"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"trapped.” The Canadian Indians were equally particular not to let their dogs gnaw the bones,or at least certain of the bones, of beavers. They took the greatest pains to collect and pre-serve these bones, and, when the beaver had been caught in a net, they threw them into theriver. To a Jesuit who argued that the beavers could not possibly know what became of theirbones, the Indians replied, “You know nothing about catching beavers and yet you will beprating about it. Before the beaver is stone dead, his soul takes a turn in the hut of the manwho is killing him and makes a careful note of what is done with his bones. If the bones aregiven to the dogs, the other beavers would get word of it and would not let themselves becaught. Whereas, if their bones are thrown into the fire or a river, they are quite satisfied; andit is particularly gratifying to the net which caught them.” Before hunting the beaver theyoffered a solemn prayer to the Great Beaver, and presented him with tobacco; and when thechase was over, an orator pronounced a funeral oration over the dead beavers. He praisedtheir spirit and wisdom. “You will hear no more,” said he, “the voice of the chieftains who com-manded you and whom you chose from among all the warrior beavers to give you laws. Yourlanguage, which the medicine-men understand perfectly, will be heard no more at the bottomof the lake. You will fight no more battles with the otters, your cruel foes. No, beavers! Butyour skins shall serve to buy arms; we will carry your smoked hams to our children; we willkeep the dogs from eating your bones, which are so hard.”The elan, deer, and elk were treated by the American Indians with the same punctiliousrespect, and for the same reason. Their bones might not be given to the dogs nor thrown intothe fire, nor might their fat be dropped upon the fire, because the souls of the dead animalswere believed to see what was done to their bodies and to tell it to the other beasts, livingand dead. Hence, if their bodies were illused, the animals of that species would not allowthemselves to be taken, neither in this world nor in the world to come. Among the Chiquites ofParaguay a sick man would be asked by the medicine-man whether he had not thrown awaysome of the flesh of the deer or turtle, and if he answered yes, the medicine-man would say,“That is what is killing you. The soul of the deer or turtle has entered into your body to avengethe wrong you did it.” The Canadian Indians would not eat the embryos of the elk, unless atthe close of the hunting season; otherwise the mother-elks would be shy and refuse to becaught.In the Timor-laut islands of the Indian Archipelago the skulls of all the turtles which a fisher-man has caught are hung up under his house. Before he goes out to catch another, headdresses himself to the skull of the last turtle that he killed, and having inserted betelbetween its jaws, he prays the spirit of the dead animal to entice its kinsfolk in the sea tocome and be caught. In the Poso district of Central Celebes hunters keep the jawbones ofdeer and wild pigs which they have killed and hang them up in their houses near the fire.Then they say to the jawbones, “Ye cry after your comrades, that your grandfathers, ornephews, or children may not go away.” Their notion is that the souls of the dead deer andpigs tarry near their jawbones and attract the souls of living deer and pigs, which are thusdrawn into the toils of the hunter. Thus the wily savage employs dead animals as decoys tolure living animals to their doom.The Lengua Indians of the Gran Chaco love to hunt the ostrich, but when they have killed oneof these birds and are bringing home the carcase to the village, they take steps to outwit theresentful ghost of their victim. They think that when the first natural shock of death is passed,the ghost of the ostrich pulls himself together and makes after his body. Acting on this sagecalculation, the Indians pluck feathers from the breast of the bird and strew them at intervalsalong the track. At every bunch of feathers the ghost stops to consider, “Is this the whole ofPage 405"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"my body or only a part of it?” The doubt gives him pause, and when at last he has made uphis mind fully at all the bunches, and has further wasted valuable time by the zigzag coursewhich he invariably pursues in going from one to another, the hunters are safe at home, andthe bilked ghost may stalk in vain round about the village, which he is too timid to enter.The Esquimaux about Bering Strait believe that the souls of dead sea-beasts, such as seals,walrus, and whales, remain attached to their bladders, and that by returning the bladders tothe sea they can cause the souls to be reincarnated in fresh bodies and so multiply the gamewhich the hunters pursue and kill. Acting on this belief every hunter carefully removes andpreserves the bladders of all the sea-beasts that he kills; and at a solemn festival held once ayear in winter these bladders, containing the souls of all the sea-beasts that have been killedthroughout the year, are honoured with dances and offerings of food in the public assembly-room, after which they are taken out on the ice and thrust through holes into the water; for thesimple Esquimaux imagine that the souls of the animals, in high good humour at the kindtreatment they have experienced, will thereafter be born again as seals, walrus, and whales,and in that form will flock willingly to be again speared, harpooned, or otherwise done todeath by the hunters.For like reasons, a tribe which depends for its subsistence, chiefly or in part, upon fishing iscareful to treat the fish with every mark of honour and respect. The Indians of Peru “adoredthe fish that they caught in greatest abundance; for they said that the first fish that was madein the world above (for so they named Heaven) gave birth to all other fish of that species, andtook care to send them plenty of its children to sustain their tribe. For this reason they wor-shipped sardines in one region, where they killed more of them than of any other fish; in oth-ers, the skate; in others, the dogfish; in others, the golden fish for its beauty; in others, thecrawfish; in others, for want of larger gods, the crabs, where they had no other fish, or wherethey knew not how to catch and kill them. In short, they had whatever fish was most servicea-ble to them as their gods.” The Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia think that when a salmonis killed its soul returns to the salmon country. Hence they take care to throw the bones andoffal into the sea, in order that the soul may reanimate them at the resurrection of the salmon.Whereas if they burned the bones the soul would be lost, and so it would be quite impossiblefor that salmon to rise from the dead. In like manner the Ottawa Indians of Canada, believingthat the souls of dead fish passed into other bodies of fish, never burned fish bones, for fearof displeasing the souls of the fish, who would come no more to the nets. The Hurons alsorefrained from throwing fish bones into the fire, lest the souls of the fish should go and warnthe other fish not to let themselves be caught, since the Hurons would burn their bones.Moreover, they had men who preached to the fish and persuaded them to come and becaught. A good preacher was much sought after, for they thought that the exhortations of aclever man had a great effect in drawing the fish to the nets. In the Huron fishing villagewhere the French missionary Sagard stayed, the preacher to the fish prided himself verymuch on his eloquence, which was of a florid order. Every evening after supper, having seenthat all the people were in their places and that a strict silence was observed, he preached tothe fish. His text was that the Hurons did not burn fish bones. “Then enlarging on this themewith extraordinary unction, he exhorted and conjured and invited and implored the fish tocome and be caught and to be of good courage and to fear nothing, for it was all to servetheir friends who honoured them and did not burn their bones.” The natives of the Duke ofYork Island annually decorate a canoe with flowers and ferns, lade it, or are supposed to ladeit, with shell-money, and set it adrift to compensate the fish for their fellows who have beencaught and eaten. It is especially necessary to treat the first fish caught with consideration inorder to conciliate the rest of the fish, whose conduct may be supposed to be influenced byPage 406"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"the reception given to those of their kind which were the first to be taken. Accordingly theMaoris always put back into the sea the first fish caught, “with a prayer that it may temptother fish to come and be caught.”Still more stringent are the precautions taken when the fish are the first of the season. Onsalmon rivers, when the fish begin to run up the stream in spring, they are received withmuch deference by tribes who, like the Indians of the Pacific Coast of North America, subsistlargely upon a fish diet. In British Columbia the Indians used to go out to meet the first fish asthey came up the river: “They paid court to them, and would address them thus: ‘You fish,you fish; you are all chiefs, you are; you are all chiefs.’” Amongst the Tlingit of Alaska the firsthalibut of the season is carefully handled and addressed as a chief, and a festival is given inhis honour, after which the fishing goes on. In spring, when the winds blow soft from thesouth and the salmon begin to run up the Klamath river, the Karoks of California dance forsalmon, to ensure a good catch. One of the Indians, called the Kareya or God-man, retires tothe mountains and fasts for ten days. On his return the people flee, while he goes to the river,takes the first salmon of the catch, eats some of it, and with the rest kindles the sacred fire inthe sweating house. “No Indian may take a salmon before this dance is held, nor for ten daysafter it, even if his family are starving.” The Karoks also believe that a fisherman will take nosalmon if the poles of which his spearing-booth is made were gathered on the river-side,where the salmon might have seen them. The poles must be brought from the top of the high-est mountain. The fisherman will also labour in vain if he uses the same poles a second yearin booths or weirs, “because the old salmon will have told the young ones about them. Thereis a favourite fish of the Aino which appears in their rivers about May and June. They preparefor the fishing by observing rules of ceremonial purity, and when they have gone out to fish,the women at home must keep strict silence or the fish would hear them and disappear.When the first fish is caught he is brought home and passed through a small opening at theend of the hut, but not through the door; for if he were passed through the door, “the otherfish would certainly see him and disappear.” This may partly explain the custom observed byother savages of bringing game in certain cases into their huts, not by the door, but by thewindow, the smoke-hole, or by a special opening at the back of the hut.With some savages a special reason for respecting the bones of game, and generally of theanimals which they eat, is a belief that, if the bones are preserved, they will in course of timebe reclothed with flesh, and thus the animal will come to life again. It is, therefore, clearly forthe interest of the hunter to leave the bones intact since to destroy them would be to diminishthe future supply of game. Many of the Minnetaree Indians “believe that the bones of thosebisons which they have slain and divested of flesh rise again clothed with renewed flesh, andquickened with life, and become fat, and fit for slaughter the succeeding June.” Hence on thewestern prairies of America, the skulls of buffaloes may be seen arranged in circles and sym-metrical piles, awaiting the resurrection. After feasting on a dog, the Dacotas carefully collectthe bones, scrape, wash, and bury them, “partly, as it is said, to testify to the dog-species,that in feasting upon one of their number no disrespect was meant to the species itself, andpartly also from a belief that the bones of the animal will rise and reproduce another.” In sacri-ficing an animal the Lapps regularly put aside the bones, eyes, ears, heart, lungs, sexualparts (if the animal was a male), and a morsel of flesh from each limb. Then, after eating theremainder of the flesh, they laid the bones and the rest in anatomical order in a coffin andburied them with the usual rites, believing that the god to whom the animal was sacrificedwould reclothe the bones with flesh and restore the animal to life in Jabme-Aimo, the subter-ranean world of the dead. Sometimes, as after feasting on a bear, they seem to have content-ed themselves with thus burying the bones. Thus the Lapps expected the resurrection of thePage 407"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"slain animal to take place in another world, resembling in this respect the Kamtchatkans, whobelieved that every creature, down to the smallest fly, would rise from the dead and liveunderground. On the other hand, the North American Indians looked for the resurrection ofthe animals in the present world. The habit, observed especially by Mongolian peoples, ofstuffing the skin of a sacrificed animal, or stretching it on a framework, points rather to a beliefin a resurrection of the latter sort. The objection commonly entertained by primitive peoples tobreak the bones of the animals which they have eaten or sacrificed may be based either on abelief in the resurrection of the animals, or on a fear of intimidating other creatures of thesame species and offending the ghosts of the slain animals. The reluctance of NorthAmerican Indians and Esquimaux to let dogs gnaw the bones of animals is perhaps only aprecaution to prevent the bones from being broken.But after all the resurrection of dead game may have its inconveniences, and accordinglysome hunters take steps to prevent it by hamstringing the animal so as to prevent it or itsghost from getting up and running away. This is the motive alleged for the practice by Kouihunters in Laos; they think that the spells which they utter in the chase may lose their magicalvirtue, and that the slaughtered animal may consequently come to life again and escape. Toprevent that catastrophe they therefore hamstring the beast as soon as they have butcheredit. When an Esquimau of Alaska has killed a fox, he carefully cuts the tendons of all the ani-mal’s legs in order to prevent the ghost from reanimating the body and walking about. Buthamstringing the carcase is not the only measure which the prudent savage adopts for thesake of disabling the ghost of his victim. In old days, when the Aino went out hunting andkilled a fox first, they took care to tie its mouth up tightly in order to prevent the ghost of theanimal from sallying forth and warning its fellows against the approach of the hunter. TheGilyaks of the Amoor River put out the eyes of the seals they have killed, lest the ghosts ofthe slain animals should know their slayers and avenge their death by spoiling the seal-hunt.Besides the animals which primitive man dreads for their strength and ferocity, and thosewhich he reveres on account of the benefits which he expects from them, there is anotherclass of creatures which he sometimes deems it necessary to conciliate by worship and sacri-fice. These are the vermin that infest his crops and his cattle. To rid himself of these deadlyfoes the farmer has recourse to many superstitious devices, of which, though some aremeant to destroy or intimidate the vermin, others aim at propitiating them and persuadingthem by fair means to spare the fruits of the earth and the herds. Thus Esthonian peasants,in the island of Oesel, stand in great awe of the weevil, an insect which is exceedinglydestructive to the grain. They give it a fine name, and if a child is about to kill a weevil theysay, “Don’t do it; the more we hurt him, the more he hurts us.” If they find a weevil they bury itin the earth instead of killing it. Some even put the weevil under a stone in the field and offercorn to it. They think that thus it is appeased and does less harm. Amongst the Saxons ofTransylvania, in order to keep sparrows from the corn, the sower begins by throwing the firsthandful of seed backwards over his head, saying, “That is for you, sparrows.” To guard thecorn against the attacks of leaf-flies he shuts his eyes and scatters three handfuls of oats indifferent directions. Having made this offering to the leaf-flies he feels sure that they will sparethe corn. A Transylvanian way of securing the crops against all birds, beasts, and insects, isthis: after he has finished sowing, the sower goes once more from end to end of the field imi-tating the gesture of sowing, but with an empty hand. As he does so he says, “I sow this forthe animals; I sow it for every thing that flies and creeps, that walks and stands, that singsand springs, in the name of God the Father, etc.” The following is a German way of freeing agarden from caterpillars. After sunset or at midnight the mistress of the house, or anotherfemale member of the family, walks all round the garden dragging a broom after her. She mayPage 408"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"not look behind her, and must keep murmuring, “Good evening, Mother Caterpillar, you shallcome with your husband to church.” The garden gate is left open till the following morning.Sometimes in dealing with vermin the farmer aims at hitting a happy mean between exces-sive rigour on the one hand and weak indulgence on the other; kind but firm, he tempersseverity with mercy. An ancient Greek treatise on farming advises the husbandman whowould rid his lands of mice to act thus: “Take a sheet of paper and write on it as follows: ‘Iadjure you, ye mice here present, that ye neither injure me nor suffer another mouse to doso. I give you yonder field’ (here you specify the field); ‘but if ever I catch you here again, bythe Mother of the Gods I will rend you in seven pieces.’ Write this, and stick the paper on anunhewn stone in the field before sunrise, taking care to keep the written side up.” In theArdennes they say that to get rid of rats you should repeat the following words: “Erat verbum,apud Deum vestrum. Male rats and female rats, I conjure you, by the great God, to go out ofmy house, out of all my habitations, and to betake yourselves to such and such a place, thereto end your days. Decretis, reversis et desembarassis virgo potens, clemens, justitiae.” Thenwrite the same words on pieces of paper, fold them up, and place one of them under the doorby which the rats are to go forth, and the other on the road which they are to take. This exor-cism should be performed at sunrise. Some years ago an American farmer was reported tohave written a civil letter to the rats, telling them that his crops were short, that he could notafford to keep them through the winter, that he had been very kind to them, and that for theirown good he thought they had better leave him and go to some of his neighbours who hadmore grain. This document he pinned to a post in his barn for the rats to read.Sometimes the desired object is supposed to be attained by treating with high distinction oneor two chosen individuals of the obnoxious species, while the rest are pursued with relentlessrigour. In the East Indian island of Bali, the mice which ravage the rice-fields are caught ingreat numbers, and burned in the same way that corpses are burned. But two of the capturedmice are allowed to live, and receive a little packet of white linen. Then the people bow downbefore them, as before gods, and let them go. When the farms of the Sea Dyaks or Ibans ofSarawak are much pestered by birds and insects, they catch a specimen of each kind of ver-min (one sparrow, one grasshopper, and so on), put them in a tiny boat of bark well-stockedwith provisions, and then allow the little vessel with its obnoxious passengers to float downthe river. If that does not drive the pests away, the Dyaks resort to what they deem a moreeffectual mode of accomplishing the same purpose. They make a clay crocodile as large aslife and set it up in the fields, where they offer it food, rice-spirit, and cloth, and sacrifice afowl and a pig before it. Mollified by these attentions, the ferocious animal very soon gobblesup all the creatures that devour the crops. In Albania, if the fields or vineyards are ravaged bylocusts or beetles, some of the women will assemble with dishevelled hair, catch a few of theinsects, and march with them in a funeral procession to a spring or stream, in which theydrown the creatures. Then one of the women sings, “O locusts and beetles who have left usbereaved,” and the dirge is taken up and repeated by all the women in chorus. Thus by cele-brating the obsequies of a few locusts and beetles, they hope to bring about the death ofthem all. When caterpillars invaded a vineyard or field in Syria, the virgins were gathered, andone of the caterpillars was taken and a girl made its mother. Then they bewailed and buriedit. Thereafter they conducted the “mother” to the place where the caterpillars were, consolingher, in order that all the caterpillars might leave the garden.Chapter LIVTypes of Animal SacramentPage 409"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"1. THE EGYPTIAN AND THE AINO TYPES OF SACRAMENTWE are now perhaps in a position to understand the ambiguous behaviour of the Aino andGilyaks towards the bear. It has been shown that the sharp line of demarcation which wedraw between mankind and the lower animals does not exist for the savage. To him many ofthe other animals appear as his equals or even his superiors, not merely in brute force but inintelligence; and if choice or necessity leads him to take their lives, he feels bound, out ofregard to his own safety, to do it in a way which will be as inoffensive as possible not merelyto the living animal, but to its departed spirit and to all the other animals of the same species,which would resent an affront put upon one of their kind much as a tribe of savages wouldrevenge an injury or insult offered to a tribesman. We have seen that among the manydevices by which the savage seeks to atone for the wrong done by him to his animal victimsone is to show marked deference to a few chosen individuals of the species, for such behav-iour is apparently regarded as entitling him to exterminate with impunity all the rest of thespecies upon which he can lay hands. This principle perhaps explains the attitude, at firstsight puzzling and contradictory, of the Aino towards the bear. The flesh and skin of the bearregularly afford them food and clothing; but since the bear is an intelligent and powerful ani-mal, it is necessary to offer some satisfaction or atonement to the bear species for the losswhich it sustains in the death of so many of its members. This satisfaction or atonement ismade by rearing young bears, treating them, so long as they live, with respect, and killingthem with extraordinary marks of sorrow and devotion. So the other bears are appeased, anddo not resent the slaughter of their kind by attacking the slayers or deserting the country,which would deprive the Aino of one of their means of subsistence.Thus the primitive worship of animals conforms to two types, which are in some respects theconverse of each other. On the one hand, animals are worshipped, and are therefore neitherkilled nor eaten. On the other hand, animals are worshipped because they are habituallykilled and eaten. In both types of worship the animal is revered on account of some benefit,positive or negative, which the savage hopes to receive from it. In the former worship thebenefit comes either in the positive shape of protection, advice, and help which the animalaffords the man, or in the negative shape of abstinence from injuries which it is in the powerof the animal to inflict. In the latter worship the benefit takes the material form of the animal’sflesh and skin. The two types of worship are in some measure antithetical: in the one, the ani-mal is not eaten because it is revered; in the other, it is revered because it is eaten. But bothmay be practised by the same people, as we see in the case of the North American Indians,who, while they apparently revere and spare their totem animals, also revere the animals andfish upon which they subsist. The aborigines of Australia have totemism in the most primitiveform known to us; but there is no clear evidence that they attempt, like the North AmericanIndians, to conciliate the animals which they kill and eat. The means which the Australiansadopt to secure a plentiful supply of game appear to be primarily based, not on conciliation,but on sympathetic magic, a principle to which the North American Indians also resort for thesame purpose. Hence, as the Australians undoubtedly represent a ruder and earlier stage ofhuman progress than the American Indians, it would seem that before hunters think of wor-shipping the game as a means of ensuring an abundant supply of it, they seek to attain thesame end by sympathetic magic. This, again, would show—what there is good reason forbelieving—that sympathetic magic is one of the earliest means by which man endeavours toadapt the agencies of nature to his needs.Corresponding to the two distinct types of animal worship, there are two distinct types of thecustom of killing the animal god. On the one hand, when the revered animal is habituallyPage 410"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"spared, it is nevertheless killed—and sometimes eaten—on rare and solemn occasions.Examples of this custom have been already given and an explanation of them offered. On theother hand, when the revered animal is habitually killed, the slaughter of any one of thespecies involves the killing of the god, and is atoned for on the spot by apologies and sacri-fices, especially when the animal is a powerful and dangerous one; and, in addition to thisordinary and everyday atonement, there is a special annual atonement, at which a select indi-vidual of the species is slain with extraordinary marks of respect and devotion. Clearly the twotypes of sacramental killing—the Egyptian and the Aino types, as we may call them for dis-tinction—are liable to be confounded by an observer; and, before we can say to which typeany particular example belongs, it is necessary to ascertain whether the animal sacramentallyslain belongs to a species which is habitually spared, or to one which is habitually killed bythe tribe. In the former case the example belongs to the Egyptian type of sacrament, in thelatter to the Aino type.The practice of pastoral tribes appears to furnish examples of both types of sacrament.“Pastoral tribes,” says Adolf Bastian, “being sometimes obliged to sell their herds to strangerswho may handle the bones disrespectfully, seek to avert the danger which such a sacrilegewould entail by consecrating one of the herd as an object of worship, eating it sacramentallyin the family circle with closed doors, and afterwards treating the bones with all the ceremoni-ous respect which, strictly speaking, should be accorded to every head of cattle, but which,being punctually paid to the representative animal, is deemed to be paid to all. Such familymeals are found among various peoples, especially those of the Caucasus. When amongstthe Abchases the shepherds in spring eat their common meal with their loins girt and theirstaves in their hands, this may be looked upon both as a sacrament and as an oath of mutualhelp and support. For the strongest of all oaths is that which is accompanied with the eatingof a sacred substance, since the perjured person cannot possibly escape the avenging godwhom he has taken into his body and assimilated.” This kind of sacrament is of the Aino orexpiatory type, since it is meant to atone to the species for the possible ill-usage of individu-als. An expiation, similar in principle but different in details, is offered by the Kalmucks to thesheep, whose flesh is one of their staple foods. Rich Kalmucks are in the habit of consecrat-ing a white ram under the title of “the ram of heaven” or “the ram of the spirit.” The animal isnever shorn and never sold; but when it grows old and its owner wishes to consecrate a newone, the old ram must be killed and eaten at a feast to which the neighbours are invited. On alucky day, generally in autumn when the sheep are fat, a sorcerer kills the old ram, aftersprinkling it with milk. Its flesh is eaten; the skeleton, with a portion of the fat, is burned on aturf altar; and the skin, with the head and feet, is hung up.An example of a sacrament of the Egyptian type is furnished by the Todas, a pastoral peopleof Southern India, who subsist largely upon the milk of their buffaloes. Amongst them “thebuffalo is to a certain degree held sacred” and “is treated with great kindness, even with adegree of adoration, by the people.” They never eat the flesh of the cow buffalo, and as a ruleabstain from the flesh of the male. But to the latter rule there is a single exception. Once ayear all the adult males of the village join in the ceremony of killing and eating a very youngmale calf—seemingly under a month old. They take the animal into the dark recesses of thevillage wood, where it is killed with a club made from the sacred tree of the Todas (theMillingtonia). A sacred fire having been made by the rubbing of sticks, the flesh of the calf isroasted on the embers of certain trees, and is eaten by the men alone, women being exclud-ed from the assembly. This is the only occasion on which the Todas eat buffalo flesh. TheMadi or Moru tribe of Central Africa, whose chief wealth is their cattle, though they also prac-tise agriculture, appear to kill a lamb sacramentally on certain solemn occasions. The customPage 411"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"is thus described by Dr. Felkin: “A remarkable custom is observed at stated times—once ayear, I am led to believe. I have not been able to ascertain what exact meaning is attached toit. It appears, however, to relieve the people’s minds, for beforehand they evince much sad-ness, and seem very joyful when the ceremony is duly accomplished. The following is whattakes place: A large concourse of people of all ages assemble, and sit down round a circle ofstones, which is erected by the side of a road (really a narrow path). A very choice lamb isthen fetched by a boy, who leads it four times round the assembled people. As it passes theypluck off little bits of its fleece and place them in their hair, or on to some other part of theirbody. The lamb is then led up to the stones, and there killed by a man belonging to a kind ofpriestly order, who takes some of the blood and sprinkles it four times over the people. Hethen applies it individually. On the children he makes a small ring of blood over the lower endof the breast bone, on women and girls he makes a mark above the breasts, and the men hetouches on each shoulder. He then proceeds to explain the ceremony, and to exhort the peo-ple to show kindness.... When this discourse, which is at times of great length, is over, thepeople rise, each places a leaf on or by the circle of stones, and then they depart with signsof great joy. The lamb’s skull is hung on a tree near the stones, and its flesh is eaten by thepoor. This ceremony is observed on a small scale at other times. If a family is in any greattrouble, through illness or bereavement, their friends and neighbours come together and alamb is killed; this is thought to avert further evil. The same custom prevails at the grave ofdeparted friends, and also on joyful occasions, such as the return of a son home after a veryprolonged absence.” The sorrow thus manifested by the people at the annual slaughter of thelamb seems to show that the lamb slain is a sacred or divine animal, whose death is mournedby his worshippers, just as the death of the sacred buzzard was mourned by the Californiansand the death of the Theban ram by the Egyptians. The smearing each of the worshipperswith the blood of the lamb is a form of communion with the divinity; the vehicle of the divinelife is applied externally instead of being taken internally, as when the blood is drunk or theflesh eaten.2. PROCESSIONS WITH SACRED ANIMALSThe form of communion in which the sacred animal is taken from house to house, that allmay enjoy a share of its divine influence, has been exemplified by the Gilyak custom of prom-enading the bear through the village before it is slain. A similar form of communion with thesacred snake is observed by a Snake tribe in the Punjaub. Once a year in the month ofSeptember the snake is worshipped by all castes and religions for nine days only. At the endof August the Mirasans, especially those of the Snake tribe, make a snake of dough whichthey paint black and red, and place on a winnowing basket. This basket they carry round thevillage, and on entering any house they say: “God be with you all! May every ill be far! Mayour patron’s (Gugga’s) word thrive!” Then they present the basket with the snake, saying: “Asmall cake of flour: a little bit of butter: if you obey the snake, you and yours shall thrive!”Strictly speaking, a cake and butter should be given, but it is seldom done. Every one, how-ever, gives something, generally a handful of dough or some corn. In houses where there is anew bride or whence a bride has gone, or where a son has been born, it is usual to give arupee and a quarter, or some cloth. Sometimes the bearers of the snake also sing: “Give the snake a piece of cloth, and he will send a lively bride!” When every house has been thus visited, the dough snake is buried and a small grave iserected over it. Thither during the nine days of September the women come to worship. Theybring a basin of curds, a small portion of which they offer at the snake’s grave, kneeling onPage 412"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"the ground and touching the earth with their foreheads. Then they go home and divide therest of the curds among the children. Here the dough snake is clearly a substitute for a realsnake. Indeed, in districts where snakes abound the worship is offered, not at the grave of thedough snake, but in the jungles where snakes are known to be. Besides this yearly worship,performed by all the people, the members of the Snake tribe worship in the same way everymorning after a new moon. The Snake tribe is not uncommon in the Punjaub. Members of itwill not kill a snake, and they say that its bite does not hurt them. If they find a dead snake,they put clothes on it and give it a regular funeral.Ceremonies closely analogous to this Indian worship of the snake have survived in Europeinto recent times, and doubtless date from a very primitive paganism. The best-known exam-ple is the “hunting of the wren.” By many European peoples—the ancient Greeks andRomans, the modern Italians, Spaniards, French, Germans, Dutch, Danes, Swedes, English,and Welsh—the wren has been designated the king, the little king, the king of birds, thehedge king, and so forth, and has been reckoned amongst those birds which it is extremelyunlucky to kill. In England it is supposed that if any one kills a wren or harries its nest, he willinfallibly break a bone or meet with some dreadful misfortune within the year; sometimes it isthought that the cows will give bloody milk. In Scotland the wren is called “the Lady ofHeaven’s hen,” and boys say: “Malisons, malisons, mair than ten, That harry the Ladye of Heaven’s hen!” At Saint Donan, in Brittany, people believe that if children touch the young wrens in the nest,they will suffer from the fire of St. Lawrence, that is, from pimples on the face, legs, and soon. In other parts of France it is thought that if a person kills a wren or harries its nest, hishouse will bestruck by lightning, or that the fingers with which he did the deed will shrivel up and drop off,or at least be maimed, or that his cattle will suffer in their feet.Notwithstanding such beliefs, the custom of annually killing the wren has prevailed widelyboth in this country and in France. In the Isle of Man down to the eighteenth century the cus-tom was observed on Christmas Eve, or rather Christmas morning. On the twenty-fourth ofDecember, towards evening, all the servants got a holiday; they did not go to bed all night,but rambled about till the bells rang in all the churches at midnight. When prayers were over,they went to hunt the wren, and having found one of these birds they killed it and fastened itto the top of a long pole with its wings extended. Thus they carried it in procession to everyhouse chanting the following rhyme: “We hunted the wren for Robin the Bobbin, We hunted the wren for Jack of the Can, We hunted the wren for Robin the Bobbin, We hunted the wren for every one.” When they had gone from house to house and collected all the money they could, they laidthe wren on a bier and carried it in procession to the parish churchyard, where they made agrave and buried it “with the utmost solemnity, singing dirges over her in the Manks language,which they call her knell; after which Christmas begins.” The burial over, the company outsidethe churchyard formed a circle and danced to music.Page 413"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"Awriter of the eighteenth century says that in Ireland the wren “is still hunted and killed by thepeasants on Christmas Day, and on the following (St. Stephen’s Day) he is carried about,hung by the leg, in the centre of two hoops, crossing each other at right angles, and a pro-cession made in every village, of men, women, and children, singing an Irish catch, importinghim to be the king of all birds.” Down to the present time the “hunting of the wren” still takesplace in parts of Leinster and Connaught. On Christmas Day or St. Stephen’s Day the boyshunt and kill the wren, fasten it in the middle of a mass of holly and ivy on the top of a broom-stick, and on St. Stephen’s Day go about with it from house to house, singing: “The wren, the wren, the king of all birds, St. Stephen’s Day was caught in the furze; Although he is little, his family’s great, I pray you, good landlady, give us a treat.” Money or food (bread, butter, eggs, etc.) were given them, upon which they feasted in theevening.In the first half of the nineteenth century similar customs were still observed in various partsof the south of France. Thus at Carcassone, every year on the first Sunday of December theyoung people of the street Saint Jean used to go out of the town armed with sticks, withwhich they beat the bushes, looking for wrens. The first to strike down one of these birds wasproclaimed King. Then they returned to the town in procession, headed by the King, who car-ried the wren on a pole. On the evening of the last day of the year the King and all who hadhunted the wren marched through the streets of the town to the light of torches, with drumsbeating and fifes playing in front of them. At the door of every house they stopped, and one ofthem wrote with chalk on the door vive le roi! with the number of the year which was about tobegin. On the morning of Twelfth Day the King again marched in procession with great pomp,wearing a crown and a blue mantle and carrying a sceptre. In front of him was borne thewren fastened to the top of a pole, which was adorned with a verdant wreath of olive, of oak,and sometimes of mistletoe grown on an oak. After hearing high mass in the parish church ofSt. Vincent, surrounded by his officers and guards, the King visited the bishop, the mayor, themagistrates, and the chief inhabitants, collecting money to defray the expenses of the royalbanquet which took place in the evening and wound up with a dance.The parallelism between this custom of “hunting the wren” and some of those which we haveconsidered, especially the Gilyak procession with the bear, and the Indian one with the snake,seems too close to allow us to doubt that they all belong to the same circle of ideas. The wor-shipful animal is killed with special solemnity once a year; and before or immediately afterdeath he is promenaded from door to door, that each of his worshippers may receive a por-tion of the divine virtues that are supposed to emanate from the dead or dying god. Religiousprocessions of this sort must have had a great place in the ritual of European peoples in pre-historic times, if we may judge from the numerous traces of them which have survived in folk-custom. For example, on the last day of the year, or Hogmanay as it was called, it used to becustomary in the Highlands of Scotland for a man to dress himself up in a cow’s hide andthus attired to go from house to house, attended by young fellows, each of them armed with astaff, to which a bit of raw hide was tied. Round every house the hide-clad man used to runthrice deiseal, that is, according to the course of the sun, so as to keep the house on his righthand; while the others pursued him, beating the hide with their staves and thereby making aloud noise like the beating of a drum. In this disorderly procession they also struck the wallsof the house. On being admitted, one of the party, standing within the threshold, pronouncedPage 414"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"a blessing on the family in these words: “May God bless the house and all that belongs to it,cattle, stones, and timber! In plenty of meat, of bed and body clothes, and health of men mayit ever abound!” Then each of the party singed in the fire a little bit of the hide which was tiedto his staff; and having done so he applied the singed hide to the nose of every person and ofevery domestic animal belonging to the house. This was imagined to secure them from dis-eases and other misfortunes, particularly from witchcraft, throughout the ensuing year. Thewhole ceremony was called calluinn because of the great noise made in beating the hide. Itwas observed in the Hebrides, including St. Kilda, down to the second half of the eighteenthcentury at least, and it seems to have survived well into the nineteenth century.Chapter LVThe Transference of Evil1. THE TRANSFERENCE TO INANIMATE OBJECTSWE have now traced the practice of killing a god among peoples in the hunting, pastoral, andagricultural stages of society; and I have attempted to explain the motives which led men toadopt so curious a custom. One aspect of the custom still remains to be noticed. The accu-mulated misfortunes and sins of the whole people are sometimes laid upon the dying god,who is supposed to bear them away for ever, leaving the people innocent and happy. Thenotion that we can transfer our guilt and sufferings to some other being who will bear them forus is familiar to the savage mind. It arises from a very obvious confusion between the physi-cal and the mental, between the material and the immaterial. Because it is possible to shift aload of wood, stones, or what not, from our own back to the back of another, the savage fan-cies that it is equally possible to shift the burden of his pains and sorrows to another, who willsuffer them in his stead. Upon this idea he acts, and the result is an endless number of veryunamiable devices for palming off upon some one else the trouble which a man shrinks frombearing himself. In short, the principle of vicarious suffering is commonly understood andpractised by races who stand on a low level of social and intellectual culture. In the followingpages I shall illustrate the theory and the practice as they are found among savages in alltheir naked simplicity, undisguised by the refinements of metaphysics and the subtleties oftheology.The devices to which the cunning and selfish savage resorts for the sake of easing himself atthe expense of his neighbour are manifold; only a few typical examples out of a multitude canbe cited. At the outset it is to be observed that the evil of which a man seeks to rid himselfneed not be transferred to a person; it may equally well be transferred to an animal or a thing,though in the last case the thing is often only a vehicle to convey the trouble to the first per-son who touches it. In some of the East Indian islands they think that epilepsy can be curedby striking the patient on the face with the leaves of certain trees and then throwing themaway. The disease is believed to have passed into the leaves, and to have been thrown awaywith them. To cure toothache some of the Australian blacks apply a heated spear-thrower tothe cheek. The spear-thrower is then cast away, and the toothache goes with it in the shapeof a black stone called karriitch. Stones of this kind are found in old mounds and sandhills.They are carefully collected and thrown in the direction of enemies in order to give themtoothache. The Bahima, a pastoral people of Uganda, often suffer from deep-seated abscess-es: “their cure for this is to transfer the disease to some other person by obtaining herbs fromthe medicine-man, rubbing them over the place where the swelling is, and burying them in theroad where people continually pass; the first person who steps over these buried herbs con-tracts the disease, and the original patient recovers.”Page 415"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"Sometimes in case of sickness the malady is transferred to an effigy as a preliminary to pass-ing it on to a human being. Thus among the Baganda the medicine-man would sometimesmake a model of his patient in clay; then a relative of the sick man would rub the image overthe sufferer’s body and either bury it in the road or hide it in the grass by the wayside. Thefirst person who stepped over the image or passed by it would catch the disease. Sometimesthe effigy was made out of a plantain-flower tied up so as to look like a person; it was used inthe same way as the clay figure. But the use of images for this maleficent purpose was acapital crime; any person caught in the act of burying one of them in the public road wouldsurely have been put to death.In the western district of the island of Timor, when men or women are making long and tiringjourneys, they fan themselves with leafy branches, which they afterwards throw away on par-ticular spots where their forefathers did the same before them. The fatigue which they felt isthus supposed to have passed into the leaves and to be left behind. Others use stonesinstead of leaves. Similarly in the Babar Archipelago tired people will strike themselves withstones, believing that they thus transfer to the stones the weariness which they felt in theirown bodies. They then throw away the stones in places which are specially set apart for thepurpose. A like belief and practice in many distant parts of the world have given rise to thosecairns or heaps of sticks and leaves which travellers often observe beside the path, and towhich every passing native adds his contribution in the shape of a stone, or stick, or leaf.Thus in the Solomon and Banks’ Islands the natives are wont to throw sticks, stones, orleaves upon a heap at a place of steep descent, or where a difficult path begins, saying,“There goes my fatigue.” The act is not a religious rite, for the thing thrown on the heap is notan offering to spiritual powers, and the words which accompany the act are not a prayer. It isnothing but a magical ceremony for getting rid of fatigue, which the simple savage fancies hecan embody in a stick, leaf, or stone, and so cast it from him.2. THE TRANSFERENCE TO ANIMALSAnimals are often employed as a vehicle for carrying away or transferring the evil. When aMoor has a headache he will sometimes take a lamb or a goat and beat it till it falls down,believing that the headache will thus be transferred to the animal. In Morocco most wealthyMoors keep a wild boar in their stables, in order that the jinn and evil spirits may be divertedfrom the horses and enter into the boar. Amongst the Caffres of South Africa, when otherremedies have failed, “natives sometimes adopt the custom of taking a goat into the presenceof a sick man, and confess the sins of the kraal over the animal. Sometimes a few drops ofblood from the sick man are allowed to fall on the head of the goat, which is turned out intoan uninhabited part of the veldt. The sickness is supposed to be transferred to the animal,and to become lost in the desert.” In Arabia, when the plague is raging, the people will some-times lead a camel through all the quarters of the town in order that the animal may take thepestilence on itself. Then they strangle it in a sacred place and imagine that they have ridthemselves of the camel and of the plague at one blow. It is said that when smallpox is ragingthe savages of Formosa will drive the demon of disease into a sow, then cut off the animal’sears and burn them or it, believing that in this way they rid themselves of the plague.Amongst the Malagasy the vehicle for carrying away evils is called a faditra. “The faditra isanything selected by the sikidy [divining board] for the purpose of taking away any hurtfulevils or diseases that might prove injurious to an individual’s happiness, peace, or prosperity.The faditra may be either ashes, cut money, a sheep, a pumpkin, or anything else the sikidyPage 416"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"may choose to direct. After the particular article is appointed, the priest counts upon it all theevils that may prove injurious to the person for whom it is made, and which he then chargesthe faditra to take away for ever. If the faditra be ashes, it is blown, to be carried away by thewind. If it be cut money, it is thrown to the bottom of deep water, or where it can never befound. If it be a sheep, it is carried away to a distance on the shoulders of a man, who runswith all his might, mumbling as he goes, as if in the greatest rage against the faditra, for theevils it is bearing away. If it be a pumpkin, it is carried on the shoulders to a little distance,and there dashed upon the ground with every appearance of fury and indignation.” AMalagasy was informed by a diviner that he was doomed to a bloody death, but that possiblyhe might avert his fate by performing a certain rite. Carrying a small vessel full of blood uponhis head, he was to mount upon the back of a bullock; while thus mounted, he was to spill theblood upon the bullock’s head, and then send the animal away into the wilderness, whence itmight never return.The Bataks of Sumatra have a ceremony which they call “making the curse to fly away.”When a woman is childless, a sacrifice is offered to the gods of three grasshoppers, repre-senting a head of cattle, a buffalo, and a horse. Then a swallow is set free, with a prayer thatthe curse may fall upon the bird and fly away with it. “The entrance into a house of an animalwhich does not generally seek to share the abode of man is regarded by the Malays as omi-nous of misfortune. If a wild bird flies into a house, it must be carefully caught and smearedwith oil, and must then be released in the open air, a formula being recited in which it is bid-den to fly away with all the ill-luck and misfortunes of the occupier.” In antiquity Greek womenseem to have done the same with swallows which they caught in the house: they poured oilon them and let them fly away, apparently for the purpose of removing ill-luck from the house-hold. The Huzuls of the Carpathians imagine that they can transfer freckles to the first swal-low they see in spring by washing their face in flowing water and saying, “Swallow, swallow,take my freckles, and give me rosy cheeks.”Among the Badagas of the Neilgherry Hills in Southern India, when a death has taken place,the sins of the deceased are laid upon a buffalo calf. For this purpose the people gatherround the corpse and carry it outside of the village. There an elder of the tribe, standing at thehead of the corpse, recites or chants a long list of sins such as any Badaga may commit, andthe people repeat the last word of each line after him. The confession of sins is thrice repeat-ed. “By a conventional mode of expression, the sum total of sins a man may do is said to bethirteen hundred. Admitting that the deceased has committed them all, the performer criesaloud, ‘Stay not their flight to God’s pure feet.’ As he closes, the whole assembly chants aloud‘Stay not their flight.’ Again the performer enters into details, and cries, ‘He killed the crawlingsnake. It is a sin.’ In a moment the last word is caught up, and all the people cry ‘It is a sin.’As they shout, the performer lays his hand upon the calf. The sin is transferred to the calf.Thus the whole catalogue is gone through in this impressive way. But this is not enough. Asthe last shout ‘Let all be well’ dies away, the performer gives place to another, and again con-fession is made, and all the people shout ‘It is a sin.’ A third time it is done. Then, still insolemn silence, the calf is let loose. Like the Jewish scapegoat, it may never be used for sec-ular work.” At a Badaga funeral witnessed by the Rev. A. C. Clayton the buffalo calf was ledthrice round the bier, and the dead man’s hand was laid on its head. “By this act, the calf wassupposed to receive all the sins of the deceased. It was then driven away to a great distance,that it might contaminate no one, and it was said that it would never be sold, but looked on asa dedicated sacred animal.” The idea of this ceremony is, that the sins of the deceased enterthe calf, or that the task of his absolution is laid on it. They say that the calf very soon disap-pears, and that it is never heard of.”Page 417"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"3. THE TRANSFERENCE TO MENAgain, men sometimes play the part of scapegoat by diverting to themselves the evils thatthreaten others. When a Cingalese is dangerously ill, and the physicians can do nothing, adevil-dancer is called in, who by making offerings to the devils, and dancing in the masksappropriate to them, conjures these demons of disease, one after the other, out of the sickman’s body and into his own. Having thus successfully extracted the cause of the malady, theartful dancer lies down on a bier, and shamming death is carried to an open place outside thevillage. Here, being left to himself, he soon comes to life again, and hastens back to claim hisreward. In 1590 a Scotch which of the name of Agnes Sampson was convicted of curing acertain Robert Kers of a disease “laid upon him by a westland warlock when he was atDumfries, whilk sickness she took upon herself, and kept the same with great groaning andtorment till the morn, at whilk time there was a great din heard in the house.” The noise wasmade by the witch in her efforts to shift the disease, by means of clothes, from herself to acat or dog. Unfortunately the attempt partly miscarried. The disease missed the animal and hitAlexander Douglas of Dalkeith, who dwined and died of it, while the original patient, RobertKers, was made whole.“In one part of New Zealand an expiation for sin was felt to be necessary; a service was per-formed over an individual, by which all the sins of the tribe were supposed to be transferredto him, a fern stalk was previously tied to his person, with which he jumped into the river, andthere unbinding, allowed it to float away to the sea, bearing their sins with it.” In great emer-gencies the sins of the Rajah of Manipur used to be transferred to somebody else, usually toa criminal, who earned his pardon by his vicarious sufferings. To effect the transference theRajah and his wife, clad in fine robes, bathed on a scaffold erected in the bazaar, while thecriminal crouched beneath it. With the water which dripped from them on him their sins alsowere washed away and fell on the human scapegoat. To complete the transference the Rajahand his wife made over their fine robes to their substitute, while they themselves, clad in newraiment, mixed with the people till evening. In Travancore, when a Rajah is near his end, theyseek out a holy Brahman, who consents to take upon himself the sins of the dying man inconsideration of the sum of ten thousand rupees. Thus prepared to immolate himself on thealtar of duty, the saint is introduced into the chamber of death, and closely embraces thedying Rajah, saying to him, “O King, I undertake to bear all your sins and diseases. May yourHighness live long and reign happily.” Having thus taken to himself the sins of the sufferer, heis sent away from the country and never more allowed to return. At Utch Kurgan in TurkestanMr. Schuyler saw an old man who was said to get his living by taking on himself the sins ofthe dead, and thenceforth devoting his life to prayer for their souls.In Uganda, when an army had returned from war, and the gods warned the king by their ora-cles that some evil had attached itself to the soldiers, it was customary to pick out a womanslave from the captives, together with a cow, a goat, a fowl, and a dog from the booty, and tosend them back under a strong guard to the borders of the country from which they hadcome. There their limbs were broken and they were left to die; for they were too crippled tocrawl back to Uganda. In order to ensure the transference of the evil to these substitutes,bunches of grass were rubbed over the people and cattle and then tied to the victims. Afterthat the army was pronounced clean and was allowed to return to the capital. So on hisaccession a new king of Uganda used to wound a man and send him away as a scapegoat toBunyoro to carry away any uncleanliness that might attach to the king or queen.Page 418"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"4. THE TRANSFERENCE OF EVIL IN EUROPEThe examples of the transference of evil hitherto adduced have been mostly drawn from thecustoms of savage or barbarous peoples. But similar attempts to shift the burden of disease,misfortune, and sin from one’s self to another person, or to an animal or thing, have beencommon also among the civilised nations of Europe, both in ancient and modern times. ARoman cure for fever was to pare the patient’s nails, and stick the parings with wax on aneighbour’s door before sunrise; the fever then passed from the sick man to his neighbour.Similar devices must have been resorted to by the Greeks; for in laying down laws for hisideal state, Plato thinks it too much to expect that men should not be alarmed at finding cer-tain wax figures adhering to their doors or to the tombstones of their parents, or lying atcross-roads. In the fourth century of our era Marcellus of Bordeaux prescribed a cure forwarts, which has still a great vogue among the superstitious in various parts of Europe. Youare to touch your warts with as many little stones as you have warts; then wrap the stones inan ivy leaf, and throw them away in a thoroughfare. Whoever picks them up will get the warts,and you will be rid of them. People in the Orkney Islands will sometimes wash a sick man,and then throw the water down at a gateway, in the belief that the sickness will leave thepatient and be transferred to the first person who passes through the gate. A Bavarian curefor fever is to write upon a piece of paper, “Fever, stay away, I am not at home,” and to putthe paper in somebody’s pocket. The latter then catches the fever, and the patient is rid of it.ABohemian prescription for the same malady is this. Take an empty pot, go with it to a cross-road, throw it down, and run away. The first person who kicks against the pot will catch yourfever, and you will be cured.Often in Europe, as among savages, an attempt is made to transfer a pain or malady from aman to an animal. Grave writers of antiquity recommended that, if a man be stung by a scor-pion, he should sit upon an ass with his face to the tail, or whisper in the animal’s ear, “Ascorpion has stung me”; in either case, they thought, the pain would be transferred from theman to the ass. Many cures of this sort are recorded by Marcellus. For example, he tells usthat the following is a remedy for toothache. Standing booted under the open sky on theground, you catch a frog by the head, spit into its mouth, ask it to carry away the ache, andthen let it go. But the ceremony must be performed on a lucky day and at a lucky hour. InCheshire the ailment known as aphtha or thrush, which affects the mouth or throat of infants,is not uncommonly treated in much the same manner. A young frog is held for a few momentswith its head inside the mouth of the sufferer, whom it is supposed to relieve by taking themalady to itself. “I assure you,” said an old woman who had often superintended such a cure,“we used to hear the poor frog whooping and coughing, mortal bad, for days after; it wouldhave made your heart ache to hear the poor creature coughing as it did about the garden.” ANorthamptonshire, Devonshire, and Welsh cure for a cough is to put a hair of the patient’shead between two slices of buttered bread and give the sandwich to a dog. The animal willthereupon catch the cough and the patient will lose it. Sometimes an ailment is transferred toan animal by sharing food with it. Thus in Oldenburg, if you are sick of a fever you set a bowlof sweet milk before a dog and say, “Good luck, you hound! may you be sick and I be sound!”Then when the dog has lapped some of the milk, you take a swig at the bowl; and then thedog must lap again, and then you must swig again; and when you and the dog have done itthe third time, he will have the fever and you will be quit of it.ABohemian cure for fever is to go out into the forest before the sun is up and look for asnipe’s nest. When you have found it, take out one of the young birds and keep it beside youfor three days. Then go back into the wood and set the snipe free. The fever will leave you atPage 419"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"once. The snipe has taken it away. So in Vedic times the Hindoos of old sent consumptionaway with a blue jay. They said, “O consumption, fly away, fly away with the blue jay! With thewild rush of the storm and the whirlwind, oh, vanish away!” In the village of Llandegla inWales there is a church dedicated to the virgin martyr St. Tecla, where the falling sickness is,or used to be, cured by being transferred to a fowl. The patient first washed his limbs in asacred well hard by, dropped fourpence into it as an offering, walked thrice round the well,and thrice repeated the Lord’s prayer. Then the fowl, which was a cock or a hen according asthe patient was a man or a woman, was put into a basket and carried round first the well andafterwards the church. Next the sufferer entered the church and lay down under the commun-ion table till break of day. After that he offered sixpence and departed, leaving the fowl in thechurch. If the bird died, the sickness was supposed to have been transferred to it from theman or woman, who was now rid of the disorder. As late as 1855 the old parish clerk of thevillage remembered quite well to have seen the birds staggering about from the effects of thefits which had been transferred to them.Often the sufferer seeks to shift his burden of sickness or ill-luck to some inanimate object. InAthens there is a little chapel of St. John the Baptist built against an ancient column. Feverpatients resort thither, and by attaching a waxed thread to the inner side of the columnbelieve that they transfer the fever from themselves to the pillar. In the Mark of Brandenburgthey say that if you suffer from giddiness you should strip yourself naked and run thrice rounda flax-field after sunset; in that way the flax will get the giddiness and you will be rid of it.But perhaps the thing most commonly employed in Europe as a receptacle for sickness andtrouble of all sorts is a tree or bush. A Bulgarian cure for fever is to run thrice around a willow-tree at sunrise, crying, “The fever shall shake thee, and the sun shall warm me.” In the Greekisland of Karpathos the priest ties a red thread round the neck of a sick person. Next morningthe friends of the patient remove the thread and go out to the hillside, where they tie thethread to a tree, thinking that they thus transfer the sickness to the tree. Italians attempt tocure fever in like manner by tethering it to a tree The sufferer ties a thread round his left wristat night, and hangs the thread on a tree next morning. The fever is thus believed to be tied upto the tree, and the patient to be rid of it; but he must be careful not to pass by that treeagain, otherwise the fever would break loose from its bonds and attack him afresh. A Flemishcure for the ague is to go early in the morning to an old willow, tie three knots in one of itsbranches, say, “Good-morrow, Old One, I give thee the cold; good-morrow, Old One,” thenturn and run away without looking round. In Sonnenberg, if you would rid yourself of gout youshould go to a young fir-tree and tie a knot in one of its twigs, saying, “God greet thee, noblefir. I bring thee my gout. Here will I tie a knot and bind my gout into it. In the name,” etc.Another way of transferring gout from a man to a tree is this. Pare the nails of the sufferer’sfingers and clip some hairs from his legs. Bore a hole in an oak, stuff the nails and hair in thehole, stop up the hole again, and smear it with cow’s dung. If, for three months thereafter, thepatient is free of gout, you may be sure the oak has it in his stead. In Cheshire if you wouldbe rid of warts, you have only to rub them with a piece of bacon, cut a slit in the bark of anash-tree, and slip the bacon under the bark. Soon the warts will disappear from your hand,only however to reappear in the shape of rough excrescences or knobs on the bark of thetree. At Berkhampstead, in Hertfordshire, there used to be certain oak-trees which were longcelebrated for the cure of ague. The transference of the malady to the tree was simple butpainful. A lock of the sufferer’s hair was pegged into an oak; then by a sudden wrench he lefthis hair and his ague behind him in the tree.Page 420"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"Chapter LVIThe Public Expulsion of Evils1. THE OMNIPRESENCE OF DEMONSIN the foregoing chapter the primitive principle of the transference of ills to another person,animal, or thing was explained and illustrated. But similar means have been adopted to free awhole community from diverse evils that afflict it. Such attempts to dismiss at once the accu-mulated sorrows of a people are by no means rare or exceptional; on the contrary they havebeen made in many lands, and from being occasional they tend to become periodic andannual.It needs some effort on our part to realise the frame of mind which prompts these attempts.Bred in a philosophy which strips nature of personality and reduces it to the unknown causeof an orderly series of impressions on our senses, we find it hard to put ourselves in the placeof the savage, to whom the same impressions appear in the guise of spirits or the handiworkof spirits. For ages the army of spirits, once so near, has been receding farther and fartherfrom us, banished by the magic wand of science from hearth and home, from ruined cell andivied tower, from haunted glade and lonely mere, from the riven murky cloud that belchesforth the lightning, and from those fairer clouds that pillow the silvery moon or fret with flakesof burning red the golden eve. The spirits are gone even from their last stronghold in the sky,whose blue arch no longer passes, except with children, for the screen that hides from mortaleyes the glories of the celestial world. Only in poets’ dreams or impassioned flights of oratoryis it given to catch a glimpse of the last flutter of the standards of the retreating host, to hearthe beat of their invisible wings, the sound of their mocking laughter, or the swell of angelmusic dying away in the distance. Far otherwise is it with the savage. To his imagination theworld still teems with those motley beings whom a more sober philosophy has discarded.Fairies and goblins, ghosts and demons, still hover about him both waking and sleeping. Theydog his footsteps, dazzle his senses, enter into him, harass and deceive and torment him in athousand freakish and mischievous ways. The mishaps that befall him, the losses he sus-tains, the pains he has to endure, he commonly sets down, if not to the magic of his enemies,to the spite or anger or caprice of the spirits. Their constant presence wearies him, theirsleepless malignity exasperates him; he longs with an unspeakable longing to be rid of themaltogether, and from time to time, driven to bay, his patience utterly exhausted, he turnsfiercely on his persecutors and makes a desperate effort to chase the whole pack of themfrom the land, to clear the air of their swarming multitudes, that he may breathe more freelyand go on his way unmolested, at least for a time. Thus it comes about that the endeavour ofprimitive people to make a clean sweep of all their troubles generally takes the form of agrand hunting out and expulsion of devils or ghosts. They think that if they can only shake offthese their accursed tormentors, they will make a fresh start in life, happy and innocent; thetales of Eden and the old poetic golden age will come true again.2. THE OCCASIONAL EXPULSION OF EVILSWe can therefore understand why those general clearances of evil, to which from time to timethe savage resorts, should commonly take the form of a forcible expulsion of devils. In theseevil spirits primitive man sees the cause of many if not of most of his troubles, and he fanciesthat if he can only deliver himself from them, things will go better with him. The publicattempts to expel the accumulated ills of a whole community may be divided into two classes,according as the expelled evils are immaterial and invisible or are embodied in a materialPage 421"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"vehicle or scape-goat. The former may be called the direct or immediate expulsion of evils;the latter the indirect or mediate expulsion, or the expulsion by scapegoat. We begin withexamples of the former.In the island of Rook, between New Guinea and New Britain, when any misfortune has hap-pened, all the people run together, scream, curse, howl, and beat the air with sticks to driveaway the devil, who is supposed to be the author of the mishap. From the spot where themishap took place they drive him step by step to the sea, and on reaching the shore theyredouble their shouts and blows in order to expel him from the island. He generally retires tothe sea or to the island of Lottin. The natives of New Britain ascribe sickness, drought, thefailure of crops, and in short all misfortunes, to the influence of wicked spirits. So at timeswhen many people sicken and die, as at the beginning of the rainy season, all the inhabitantsof a district, armed with branches and clubs, go out by moonlight to the fields, where theybeat and stamp on the ground with wild howls till morning, believing that this drives away thedevils; and for the same purpose they rush through the village with burning torches. Thenatives of New Caledonia are said to believe that all evils are caused by a powerful andmalignant spirit; hence in order to rid themselves of him they will from time to time dig a greatpit, round which the whole tribe gathers. After cursing the demon, they fill up the pit withearth, and trample on the top with loud shouts. This they call burying the evil spirit. Amongthe Dieri tribe of Central Australia, when a serious illness occurs, the medicine-men expelCootchie or the devil by beating the ground in and outside of the camp with the stuffed tail ofa kangaroo, until they have chased the demon away to some distance from the camp.When a village has been visited by a series of disasters or a severe epidemic, the inhabitantsof Minahassa in Celebes lay the blame upon the devils who are infesting the village and whomust be expelled from it. Accordingly, early one morning all the people, men, women, andchildren, quit their homes, carrying their household goods with them, and take up their quar-ters in temporary huts which have been erected outside the village. Here they spend severaldays, offering sacrifices and preparing for the final ceremony. At last the men, some wearingmasks, others with their faces blackened, and so on, but all armed with swords, guns, pikes,or brooms, steal cautiously and silently back to the deserted village. Then, at a signal fromthe priest, they rush furiously up and down the streets and into and under the houses (whichare raised on piles above the ground), yelling and striking on walls, doors, and windows, todrive away the devils. Next, the priests and the rest of the people come with the holy fire andmarch nine times round each house and thrice round the ladder that leads up to it, carryingthe fire with them. Then they take the fire into the kitchen, where it must burn for three dayscontinuously. The devils are now driven away, and great and general is the joy.The Alfoors of Halmahera attribute epidemics to the devil who comes from other villages tocarry them off. So, in order to rid the village of the disease, the sorcerer drives away the devil.From all the villagers he receives a costly garment and places it on four vessels, which hetakes to the forest and leaves at the spot where the devil is supposed to be. Then with mock-ing words he bids the demon abandon the place. In the Kei Islands to the south-west of NewGuinea, the evil spirits, who are quite distinct from the souls of the dead, form a mighty host.Almost every tree and every cave is the lodging-place of one of these fiends, who are more-over extremely irascible and apt to fly out on the smallest provocation. They manifest theirdispleasure by sending sickness and other calamities. Hence in times of public misfortune, aswhen an epidemic is raging, and all other remedies have failed, the whole population go forthwith the priest at their head to a place at some distance from the village. Here at sunset theyerect a couple of poles with a cross-bar between them, to which they attach bags of rice,Page 422"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"wooden models of pivot-guns, gongs, bracelets, and so on. Then, when everybody has takenhis place at the poles and a death-like silence reigns, the priest lifts up his voice and address-es the spirits in their own language as follows: “Ho! ho! ho! ye evil spirits who dwell in thetrees, ye evil spirits who live in the grottoes, ye evil spirits who lodge in the earth, we give youthese pivot-guns, these gongs, etc. Let the sickness cease and not so many people die of it.”Then everybody runs home as fast as their legs can carry them.In the island of Nias, when a man is seriously ill and other remedies have been tried in vain,the sorcerer proceeds to exorcise the devil who is causing the illness. A pole is set up in frontof the house, and from the top of the pole a rope of palm-leaves is stretched to the roof of thehouse. Then the sorcerer mounts the roof with a pig, which he kills and allows to roll from theroof to the ground. The devil, anxious to get the pig, lets himself down hastily from the roof bythe rope of palm-leaves, and a good spirit, invoked by the sorcerer, prevents him from climb-ing up again. If this remedy fails, it is believed that other devils must still be lurking in thehouse. So a general hunt is made after them. All the doors and windows in the house areclosed, except a single dormer-window in the roof. The men, shut up in the house, hew andslash with their swords right and left to the clash of gongs and the rub-a-dub of drums.Terrified at this onslaught, the devils escape by the dormer-window, and sliding down the ropeof palm-leaves take themselves off. As all the doors and windows, except the one in the roof,are shut, the devils cannot get into the house again. In the case of an epidemic, the proceed-ings are similar. All the gates of the village, except one, are closed; every voice is raised,every gong and drum beaten, every sword brandished. Thus the devils are driven out and thelast gate is shut behind them. For eight days thereafter the village is in a state of siege, noone being allowed to enter it.When cholera has broken out in a Burmese village the able-bodied men scramble on theroofs and lay about them with bamboos and billets of wood, while all the rest of the popula-tion, old and young, stand below and thump drums, blow trumpets, yell, scream, beat floors,walls, tin pans, everything to make a din. This uproar, repeated on three successive nights, isthought to be very effective in driving away the cholera demons. When smallpox firstappeared amongst the Kumis of South-Eastern India, they thought it was a devil come fromAracan. The villages were placed in a state of siege, no one being allowed to leave or enterthem. A monkey was killed by being dashed on the ground, and its body was hung at the vil-lage gate. Its blood, mixed with small river pebbles, was sprinkled on the houses, the thresh-old of every house was swept with the monkey’s tail, and the fiend was adjured to depart.When an epidemic is raging on the Gold Coast of West Africa, the people will sometimes turnout, armed with clubs and torches, to drive the evil spirits away. At a given signal the wholepopulation begin with frightful yells to beat in every corner of the houses, then rush like madinto the streets waving torches and striking frantically in the empty air. The uproar goes on tillsomebody reports that the cowed and daunted demons have made good their escape by agate of the town or village; the people stream out after them, pursue them for some distanceinto the forest, and warn them never to return. The expulsion of the devils is followed by ageneral massacre of all the cocks in the village or town, lest by their unseasonable crowingthey should betray to the banished demons the direction they must take to return to their oldhomes. When sickness was prevalent in a Huron village, and all other remedies had beentried in vain, the Indians had recourse to the ceremony called Lonouyroya, “which is the prin-cipal invention and most proper means, so they say, to expel from the town or village the dev-ils and evil spirits which cause, induce, and import all the maladies and infirmities which theysuffer in body and mind.” Accordingly, one evening the men would begin to rush like madmenPage 423"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"about the village, breaking and upsetting whatever they came across in the wigwams. Theythrew fire and burning brands about the streets, and all night long they ran howling andsinging without cessation. Then they all dreamed of something, a knife, dog, skin, or whateverit might be, and when morning came they went from wigwam to wigwam asking for presents.These they received silently, till the particular thing was given them which they had dreamedabout. On receiving it they uttered a cry of joy and rushed from the hut, amid the congratula-tions of all present. The health of those who received what they had dreamed of was believedto be assured; whereas those who did not get what they had set their hearts upon regardedtheir fate as sealed.Sometimes, instead of chasing the demon of disease from their homes, savages prefer toleave him in peaceable possession, while they themselves take to flight and attempt to pre-vent him from following in their tracks. Thus when the Patagonians were attacked by small-pox, which they attributed to the machinations of an evil spirit, they used to abandon their sickand flee, slashing the air with their weapons and throwing water about in order to keep off thedreadful pursuer; and when after several days’ march they reached a place where they hopedto be beyond his reach, they used by way of precaution to plant all their cutting weapons withthe sharp edges turned towards the quarter from which they had come, as if they wererepelling a charge of cavalry. Similarly, when the Lules or Tonocotes Indians of the GranChaco were attacked by an epidemic, they regularly sought to evade it by flight, but in sodoing they always followed a sinuous, not a straight, course; because they said that when thedisease made after them he would be so exhausted by the turnings and windings of the routethat he would never be able to come up with them. When the Indians of New Mexico weredecimated by smallpox or other infectious disease, they used to shift their quarters every day,retreating into the most sequestered parts of the mountains and choosing the thorniest thick-ets they could find, in the hope that the smallpox would be too afraid of scratching himself onthe thorns to follow them. When some Chins on a visit to Rangoon were attacked by cholera,they went about with drawn swords to scare away the demon, and they spent the day hidingunder bushes so that he might not be able to find them.3. THE PERIODIC EXPULSION OF EVILSThe expulsion of evils, from being occasional, tends to become periodic. It comes to bethought desirable to have a general riddance of evil spirits at fixed times, usually once a year,in order that the people may make a fresh start in life, freed from all the malignant influenceswhich have been long accumulating about them. Some of the Australian blacks annuallyexpelled the ghosts of the dead from their territory. The ceremony was witnessed by the Rev.W. Ridley on the banks of the River Barwan. “A chorus of twenty, old and young, were singingand beating time with boomerangs.... Suddenly, from under a sheet of bark darted a man withhis body whitened by pipeclay, his head and face coloured with lines of red and yellow, and atuft of feathers fixed by means of a stick two feet above the crown of his head. He stoodtwenty minutes perfectly still, gazing upwards. An aboriginal who stood by told me he waslooking for the ghosts of dead men. At last he began to move very slowly, and soon rushed toand fro at full speed, flourishing a branch as if to drive away some foes invisible to us. When Ithought this pantomime must be almost over, ten more, similarly adorned, suddenly appearedfrom behind the trees, and the whole party joined in a brisk conflict with their mysteriousassailants.... At last, after some rapid evolutions in which they put forth all their strength, theyrested from the exciting toil which they had kept up all night and for some hours after sunrise;they seemed satisfied that the ghosts were driven away for twelve months. They were per-forming the same ceremony at every station along the river, and I am told it is an annual cus-Page 424"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"tom.”Certain seasons of the year mark themselves naturally out as appropriate moments for a gen-eral expulsion of devils. Such a moment occurs towards the close of an Arctic winter, whenthe sun reappears on the horizon after an absence of weeks or months. Accordingly, at PointBarrow, the most northerly extremity of Alaska, and nearly of America, the Esquimaux choosethe moment of the sun’s reappearance to hunt the mischievous spirit Tuña from every house.The ceremony was witnessed by the members of the United States Polar Expedition, whowintered at Point Barrow. A fire was built in front of the council-house, and an old woman wasposted at the entrance to every house. The men gathered round the council-house while theyoung women and girls drove the spirit out of every house with their knives, stabbing viciouslyunder the bunk and deer-skins, and calling upon Tuña to be gone. When they thought he hadbeen driven out of every hole and corner, they thrust him down through the hole in the floorand chased him into the open air with loud cries and frantic gestures. Meanwhile the oldwoman at the entrance of the house made passes with a long knife in the air to keep himfrom returning. Each party drove the spirit towards the fire and invited him to go into it. Allwere by this time drawn up in a semicircle round the fire, when several of the leading menmade specific charges against the spirit; and each after his speech brushed his clothes vio-lently, calling on the spirit to leave him and go into the fire. Two men now stepped forwardwith rifles loaded with blank cartridges, while a third brought a vessel of urine and flung it onthe flames. At the same time one of the men fired a shot into the fire; and as the cloud ofsteam rose it received the other shot, which was supposed to finish Tunña for the time being.In late autumn, when storms rage over the land and break the icy fetters by which the frozensea is as yet but slightly bound, when the loosened floes are driven against each other andbreak with loud crashes, and when the cakes of ice are piled in wild disorder one upon anoth-er, the Esquimaux of Baffin Land fancy they hear the voices of the spirits who people the mis-chief-laden air. Then the ghosts of the dead knock wildly at the huts, which they cannot enter,and woe to the hapless wight whom they catch; he soon sickens and dies. Then the phantomof a huge hairless dog pursues the real dogs, which expire in convulsions and cramps atsight of him. All the countless spirits of evil are abroad striving to bring sickness and death,foul weather and failure in hunting on the Esquimaux. Most dreaded of all these spectral visi-tants are Sedna, mistress of the nether world, and her father, to whose share deadEsquimaux fall. While the other spirits fill the air and the water, she rises from under ground.It is then a busy season for the wizards. In every house you may hear them singing and pray-ing, while they conjure the spirits, seated in a mystic gloom at the back of the hut, which isdimly lit by a lamp burning low. The hardest task of all is to drive away Sedna, and this isreserved for the most powerful enchanter. A rope is coiled on the floor of a large hut in such away as to leave a small opening at the top, which represents the breathing hole of a seal.Two enchanters stand beside it, one of them grasping a spear as if he were watching a seal-hole in winter, the other holding the harpoon-line. A third sorcerer sits at the back of the hutchanting a magic song to lure Sedna to the spot. Now she is heard approaching under thefloor of the hut, breathing heavily; now she emerges at the hole; now she is harpooned andsinks away in angry haste, dragging the harpoon with her, while the two men hold on to theline with all their might. The struggle is severe, but at last by a desperate wrench she tearsherself away and returns to her dwelling in Adlivun. When the harpoon is drawn up out of thehole it is found to be splashed with blood, which the enchanters proudly exhibit as a proof oftheir prowess. Thus Sedna and the other evil spirits are at last driven away, and next day agreat festival is celebrated by old and young in honour of the event. But they must still becautious, for the wounded Sedna is furious and will seize any one she may find outside of hisPage 425"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"hut; so they all wear amulets on the top of their hoods to protect themselves against her.These amulets consist of pieces of the first garments that they wore after birth.The Iroquois inaugurated the new year in January, February, or March (the time varied) with a“festival of dreams” like that which the Hurons observed on special occasions. The whole cer-emonies lasted several days, or even weeks, and formed a kind of saturnalia. Men andwomen, variously disguised, went from wigwam to wigwam smashing and throwing downwhatever they came across. It was a time of general license; the people were supposed to beout of their senses, and therefore not to be responsible for what they did. Accordingly, manyseized the opportunity of paying off old scores by belabouring obnoxious persons, drenchingthem with ice-cold water, and covering them with filth or hot ashes. Others seized burningbrands or coals and flung them at the heads of the first persons they met. The only way ofescaping from these persecutors was to guess what they had dreamed of. On one day of thefestival the ceremony of driving away evil spirits from the village took place. Men clothed inthe skins of wild beasts, their faces covered with hideous masks, and their hands with theshell of the tortoise, went from hut to hut making frightful noises; in every hut they took thefuel from the fire and scattered the embers and ashes about the floor with their hands. Thegeneral confession of sins which preceded the festival was probably a preparation for thepublic expulsion of evil influences; it was a way of stripping the people of their moral burdens,that these might be collected and cast out.In September the Incas of Peru celebrated a festival called Situa, the object of which was tobanish from the capital and its vicinity all disease and trouble. The festival fell in Septemberbecause the rains begin about this time, and with the first rains there was generally muchsickness. As a preparation for the festival the people fasted on the first day of the moon afterthe autumnal equinox. Having fasted during the day, and the night being come, they baked acoarse paste of maize. This paste was made of two sorts. One was kneaded with the blood ofchildren aged from five to ten years, the blood being obtained by bleeding the childrenbetween the eyebrows. These two kinds of paste were baked separately, because they werefor different uses. Each family assembled at the house of the eldest brother to celebrate thefeast; and those who had no elder brother went to the house of their next relation of greaterage. On the same night all who had fasted during the day washed their bodies, and taking alittle of the blood-kneaded paste, rubbed it over their head, face, breast, shoulders, arms andlegs. They did this in order that the paste might take away all their infirmities. After this thehead of the family anointed the threshold with the same paste, and left it there as a token thatthe inmates of the house had performed their ablutions and cleansed their bodies. Meantimethe High Priest performed the same ceremonies in the temple of the Sun. As soon as the Sunrose, all the people worshipped and besought him to drive all evils out of the city, and thenthey broke their fast with the paste that had been kneaded without blood. When they had paidtheir worship and broken their fast, which they did at a stated hour, in order that all mightadore the Sun as one man, an Inca of the blood royal came forth from the fortress, as a mes-senger of the Sun, richly dressed, with his mantle girded round his body, and a lance in hishand. The lance was decked with feathers of many hues, extending from the blade to thesocket, and fastened with rings of gold. He ran down the hill from the fortress brandishing hislance, till he reached the centre of the great square, where stood the golden urn, like a foun-tain, that was used for the sacrifice of the fermented juice of the maize. Here four other Incasof the blood royal awaited him, each with a lance in his hand, and his mantle girded up to run.The messenger touched their four lances with his lance, and told them that the Sun badethem, as his messengers, drive the evils out of the city. The four Incas then separated andran down the four royal roads which led out of the city to the four quarters of the world. WhilePage 426"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"they ran, all the people, great and small, came to the doors of their houses, and with greatshouts of joy and gladness shook their clothes, as if they were shaking off dust, while theycried, “Let the evils be gone. How greatly desired has this festival been by us. O Creator of allthings, permit us to reach another year, that we may see another feast like this.” After theyhad shaken their clothes, they passed their hands over their heads, faces, arms, and legs, asif in the act of washing. All this was done to drive the evils out of their houses, that the mes-sengers of the Sun might banish them from the city; and it was done not only in the streetsthrough which the Incas ran, but generally in all quarters of the city. Moreover, they alldanced, the Inca himself amongst them, and bathed in the rivers and fountains, saying thattheir maladies would come out of them. Then they took great torches of straw, bound roundwith cords. These they lighted, and passed from one to the other, striking each other withthem, and saying, “Let all harm go away.” Meanwhile the runners ran with their lances for aquarter of a league outside the city, where they found four other Incas ready, who receivedthe lances from their hands and ran with them. Thus the lances were carried by relays of run-ners for a distance of five or six leagues, at the end of which the runners washed themselvesand their weapons in rivers, and set up the lances, in sign of a boundary within which thebanished evils might not return.The negroes of Guinea annually banish the devil from all their towns with much ceremony ata time set apart for the purpose. At Axim, on the Gold Coast, this annual expulsion is preced-ed by a feast of eight days, during which mirth and jollity, skipping, dancing, and singing pre-vail, and “a perfect lampooning liberty is allowed, and scandal so highly exalted, that theymay freely sing of all the faults, villanies, and frauds of their superiors as well as inferiors,without punishment, or so much as the least interruption.” On the eighth day they hunt out thedevil with a dismal cry, running after him and pelting him with sticks, stones, and whatevercomes to hand. When they have driven him far enough out of the town, they all return. In thisway he is expelled from more than a hundred towns at the same time. To make sure that hedoes not return to their houses, the women wash and scour all their wooden and earthen ves-sels, “to free them from all uncleanness and the devil.”At Cape Coast Castle, on the Gold Coast, the ceremony was witnessed on the ninth ofOctober, 1844, by an Englishman, who has described it as follows: “To-night the annual cus-tom of driving the evil spirit, Abonsam, out of the town has taken place. As soon as the eighto’clock gun fired in the fort the people began firing muskets in their houses, turning all theirfurniture out of doors, beating about in every corner of the rooms with sticks, etc., andscreaming as loudly as possible, in order to frighten the devil. Being driven out of the houses,as they imagine, they sallied forth into the streets, throwing lighted torches about, shouting,screaming, beating sticks together, rattling old pans, making the most horrid noise, in order todrive him out of the town into the sea. The custom is preceded by four weeks’ dead silence;no gun is allowed to be fired, no drum to be beaten, no palaver to be made between man andman. If, during these weeks, two natives should disagree and make a noise in the town, theyare immediately taken before the king and fined heavily. If a dog or pig, sheep or goat befound at large in the street, it may be killed, or taken by anyone, the former owner not beingallowed to demand any compensation. This silence is designed to deceive Abonsam, that,being off his guard, he may be taken by surprise, and frightened out of the place. If anyonedie during the silence, his relatives are not allowed to weep until the four weeks have beencompleted.”Sometimes the date of the annual expulsion of devils is fixed with reference to the agriculturalseasons. Thus among the Hos of Togoland, in West Africa, the expulsion is performed annu-Page 427"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"ally before the people partake of the new yams. The chiefs summon the priests and magi-cians and tell them that the people are now to eat the new yams and be merry, therefore theymust cleanse the town and remove the evils. Accordingly the evil spirits, witches, and all theills that infest the people are conjured into bundles of leaves and creepers, fastened to poles,which are carried away and set up in the earth on various roads outside the town. During thefollowing night no fire may be lit and no food eaten. Next morning the women sweep out theirhearths and houses, and deposit the sweepings on broken wooden plates. Then the peoplepray, saying, “All ye sicknesses that are in our body and plague us, we are come to-day tothrow you out.” Thereupon they run as fast as they can in the direction of Mount Adaklu, smit-ing their mouths and screaming, “Out to-day! Out to-day! That which kills anybody, out to-day!Ye evil spirits, out to-day! and all that causes our heads to ache, out to-day! Anlo and Adakluare the places whither all ill shall betake itself!” When they have come to a certain tree onMount Adaklu, they throw everything away and return home.At Kiriwina, in South-Eastern New Guinea, when the new yams had been harvested, the peo-ple feasted and danced for many days, and a great deal of property, such as armlets, nativemoney, and so forth, was displayed conspicuously on a platform erected for the purpose.When the festivities were over, all the people gathered together and expelled the spirits fromthe village by shouting, beating the posts of the houses, and overturning everything underwhich a wily spirit might be supposed to lurk. The explanation which the people gave to amissionary was that they had entertained and feasted the spirits and provided them with rich-es, and it was now time for them to take their departure. Had they not seen the dances, andheard the songs, and gorged themselves on the souls of the yams, and appropriated thesouls of the money and all the other fine things set out on the platform? What more could thespirits want? So out they must go.Among the Hos of North-Eastern India the great festival of the year is the harvest home, heldin January, when the granaries are full of grain, and the people, to use their own expression,are full of devilry. “They have a strange notion that at this period, men and women are soovercharged with vicious propensities, that it is absolutely necessary for the safety of the per-son to let off steam by allowing for a time full vent to the passions.” The ceremonies openwith a sacrifice to the village god of three fowls, a cock and two hens, one of which must beblack. Along with them are offered flowers of the palas tree (Butea frondosa), bread madefrom rice-flour, and sesamum seeds. These offerings are presented by the village priest, whoprays that during the year about to begin they and their children may be preserved from allmisfortune and sickness, and that they may have seasonable rain and good crops. Prayer isalso made in some places for the souls of the dead. At this time an evil spirit is supposed toinfest the place, and to get rid of it men, women, and children go in procession round andthrough every part of the village with sticks in their hands, as if beating for game, singing awild chant, and shouting vociferously, till they feel assured that the evil spirit must have fled.Then they give themselves up to feasting and drinking rice-beer, till they are in a fit state forthe wild debauch which follows. The festival now “becomes a saturnale, during which ser-vants forget their duty to their masters, children their reverence for parents, men their respectfor women, and women all notions of modesty, delicacy, and gentleness; they become ragingbacchantes.” Usually the Hos are quiet and reserved in manner, decorous and gentle towomen. But during this festival “their natures appear to undergo a temporary change. Sonsand daughters revile their parents in gross language, and parents their children; men andwomen become almost like animals in the indulgence of their amorous propensities.” TheMundaris, kinsmen and neighbours of the Hos, keep the festival in much the same manner.“The resemblance to a Saturnale is very complete, as at this festival the farm labourers arePage 428"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"feasted by their masters, and allowed the utmost freedom of speech in addressing them. It isthe festival of the harvest home; the termination of one year’s toil, and a slight respite from itbefore they commence again.”Amongst some of the Hindoo Koosh tribes, as among the Hos and Mundaris, the expulsion ofdevils takes place after harvest. When the last crop of autumn has been got in, it is thoughtnecessary to drive away evil spirits from the granaries. A kind of porridge is eaten, and thehead of the family takes his matchlock and fires it into the floor. Then, going outside, he setsto work loading and firing till his powder-horn is exhausted, while all his neighbours are simi-larly employed. The next day is spent in rejoicings. In Chitral this festival is called “devil-driv-ing.” On the other hand the Khonds of India expel the devils at seed-time instead of at har-vest. At this time they worship Pitteri Pennu, the god of increase and of gain in every shape.On the first day of the festival a rude car is made of a basket set upon a few sticks, tied uponthe bamboo rollers for wheels. The priest takes this car first to the house of the lineal head ofthe tribe, to whom precedence is given in all ceremonies connected with agriculture. Here hereceives a little of each kind of seed and some feathers. He then takes the car to all the otherhouses in the village, each of which contributes the same things. Lastly, the car is conductedto a field without the village, attended by all the young men, who beat each other and strikethe air violently with long sticks. The seed thus carried out is called the share of the “evil spir-its, spoilers of the seed.” “These are considered to be driven out with the car; and when it andits contents are abandoned to them, they are held to have no excuse for interfering with therest of the seed-corn.”The people of Bali, an island to the east of Java, have periodical expulsions of devils upon agreat scale. Generally the time chosen for the expulsion is the day of the “dark moon” in theninth month. When the demons have been long unmolested the country is said to be “warm,”and the priest issues orders to expel them by force, lest the whole of Bali should be rendereduninhabitable. On the day appointed the people of the village or district assemble at the prin-cipal temple. Here at a cross-road offerings are set out for the devils. After prayers have beenrecited by the priests, the blast of a horn summons the devils to partake of the meal whichhas been prepared for them. At the same time a number of men step forward and light theirtorches at the holy lamp which burns before the chief priest. Immediately afterwards, followedby the bystanders, they spread in all directions and march through the streets and lanes cry-ing, “Depart! go away!” Wherever they pass, the people who have stayed at home hasten, bya deafening clatter on doors, beams, rice-blocks, and so forth, to take their share in theexpulsion of devils. Thus chased from the houses, the fiends flee to the banquet which hasbeen set out for them; but here the priest receives them with curses which finally drive themfrom the district. When the last devil has taken his departure, the uproar is succeeded by adead silence, which lasts during the next day also. The devils, it is thought, are anxious toreturn to their old homes, and in order to make them think that Bali is not Bali but somedesert island, no one may stir from his own abode for twenty-four hours. Even ordinaryhousehold work, including cooking, is discontinued. Only the watchmen may show them-selves in the streets. Wreaths of thorns and leaves are hung at all the entrances to warnstrangers from entering. Not till the third day is this state of siege raised, and even then it isforbidden to work at the rice-fields or to buy and sell in the market. Most people still stay athome, whiling away the time with cards and dice.In Tonquin a theckydaw or general expulsion of maleyolent spirits commonly took place oncea year, especially if there was a great mortality amongst men, the elephants or horses of thegeneral’s stable, or the cattle of the country, “the cause of which they attribute to the mali-Page 429"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"cious spirits of such men as have been put to death for treason, rebellion, and conspiring thedeath of the king, general, or princes, and that in revenge of the punishment they have suf-fered, they are bent to destroy everything and commit horrible violence. To prevent whichtheir superstition has suggested to them the institution of this theckydaw, as a proper meansto drive the devil away, and purge the country of evil spirits.” The day appointed for the cere-mony was generally the twenty-fifth of February, one month after the beginning of the newyear, which fell on the twenty-fifth of January. The intermediate month was a season of feast-ing, merry-making of all kinds, and general licence. During the whole month the great sealwas kept shut up in a box, face downwards, and the law was, as it were, laid asleep. Allcourts of justice were closed; debtors could not be seized; small crimes, such as petty larce-ny, fighting, and assault, escaped with impunity; only treason and murder were taken accountof and the malefactors detained till the great seal should come into operation again. At theclose of the saturnalia the wicked spirits were driven away. Great masses of troops andartillery having been drawn up with flying colours and all the pomp of war, “the general begin-neth then to offer meat offerings to the criminal devils and malevolent spirits (for it is usualand customary likewise amongst them to feast the condemned before their execution), invit-ing them to eat and drink, when presently he accuses them in a strange language, by charac-ters and figures, etc., of many offences and crimes committed by them, as to their having dis-quieted the land, killed his elephants and horses, etc., for all which they justly deserve to bechastised and banished the country. Whereupon three great guns are fired as the last signal;upon which all the artillery and musquets are discharged, that, by their most terrible noise thedevils may be driven away; and they are so blind as to believe for certain, that they really andeffectually put them to flight.”In Cambodia the expulsion of evil spirits took place in March. Bits of broken statues andstones, considered as the abode of the demons, were collected and brought to the capital.Here as many elephants were collected as could be got together. On the evening of the fullmoon volleys of musketry were fired and the elephants charged furiously to put the devils toflight. The ceremony was performed on three successive days. In Siam the banishment ofdemons is annually carried into effect on the last day of the old year. A signal gun is fired fromthe palace; it is answered from the next station, and so on from station to station, till the firinghas reached the outer gate of the city. Thus the demons are driven out step by step. As soonas this is done a consecrated rope is fastened round the circuit of the city walls to prevent thebanished demons from returning. The rope is made of tough couch-grass and is painted inalternate stripes of red, yellow, and blue.Annual expulsions of demons, witches, or evil influences appear to have been commonamong the heathen of Europe, if we may judge from the relics of such customs among theirdescendants at the present day. Thus among the heathen Wotyaks, a Finnish people ofEastern Russia, all the young girls of the village assemble on the last day of the year or onNew Year’s Day, armed with sticks, the ends of which are split in nine places. With these theybeat every corner of the house and yard, saying, “We are driving Satan out of the village.”Afterwards the sticks are thrown into the river below the village, and as they float downstream Satan goes with them to the next village, from which he must be driven out in turn. Insome villages the expulsion is managed otherwise. The unmarried men receive from everyhouse in the village groats, flesh, and brandy. These they take to the fields, light a fire undera fir-tree, boil the groats, and eat of the food they have brought with them, after pronouncingthe words, “Go away into the wilderness, come not into the house.” Then they return to thevillage and enter every house where there are young women. They take hold of the youngwomen and throw them into the snow, saying, “May the spirits of disease leave you.” ThePage 430"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"remains of the groats and the other food are then distributed among all the houses in propor-tion to the amount that each contributed, and each family consumes its share. According to aWotyak of the Malmyz district the young men throw into the snow whomever they find in thehouses, and this is called “driving out Satan”; moreover, some of the boiled groats are castinto the fire with the words, “O god, afflict us not with sickness and pestilence, give us not upas a prey to the spirits of the wood.” But the most antique form of the ceremony is thatobserved by the Wotyaks of the Kasan Government. First of all a sacrifice is offered to theDevil at noon. Then all the men assemble on horseback in the centre of the village, anddecide with which house they shall begin. When this question, which often gives rise to hotdisputes, is settled, they tether their horses to the paling, and arm themselves with whips,clubs of lime-wood and bundles of lighted twigs. The lighted twigs are believed to have thegreatest terrors for Satan. Thus armed, they proceed with frightful cries to beat every cornerof the house and yard, then shut the door, and spit at the ejected fiend. So they go fromhouse to house, till the Devil has been driven from every one. Then they mount their horsesand ride out of the village, yelling wildly and brandishing their clubs in every direction. Outsideof the village they fling away the clubs and spit once more at the Devil. The Cheremiss,another Finnish people of Eastern Russia, chase Satan from their dwellings by beating thewalls with cudgels of lime-wood. For the same purpose they fire guns, stab the ground withknives, and insert burning chips of wood in the crevices. Also they leap over bonfires, shakingout their garments as they do so; and in some districts they blow on long trumpets of lime-tree bark to frighten him away. When he has fled to the wood, they pelt the trees with some ofthe cheese-cakes and eggs which furnished the feast.In Christian Europe the old heathen custom of expelling the powers of evil at certain times ofthe year has survived to modern times. Thus in some villages of Calabria the month of Marchis inaugurated with the expulsion of the witches. It takes place at night to the sound of thechurch bells, the people running about the streets and crying, “March is come.” They say thatthe witches roam about in March, and the ceremony is repeated every Friday evening duringthe month. Often, as might have been anticipated, the ancient pagan rite has attached itselfto church festivals. In Albania on Easter Eve the young people light torches of resinous woodand march in procession, swinging them, through the village. At last they throw the torchesinto the river, crying, “Ha, Kore! we throw you into the river, like these torches, that you maynever return.” Silesian peasants believe that on Good Friday the witches go their rounds andhave great power for mischief. Hence about Oels, near Strehlitz, the people on that day armthemselves with old brooms and drive the witches from house and home, from farmyard andcattle-stall, making a great uproar and clatter as they do so.In Central Europe the favourite time for expelling the witches is, or was, Walpurgis Night, theEve of May Day, when the baleful powers of these mischievous beings were supposed to beat their height. In the Tyrol, for example, as in other places, the expulsion of the powers of evilat this season goes by the name of “Burning out the Witches.” It takes place on May Day, butpeople have been busy with their preparations for days before. On a Thursday at midnightbundles are made up of resinous splinters, black and red spotted hemlock, caperspurge,rosemary, and twigs of the sloe. These are kept and burned on May Day by men who mustfirst have received plenary absolution from the Church. On the last three days of April all thehouses are cleansed and fumigated with juniper berries and rue. On May Day, when theevening bell has rung and the twilight is falling, the ceremony of “Burning out the Witches”begins. Men and boys make a racket with whips, bells, pots, and pans; the women carrycensers; the dogs are unchained and run barking and yelping about. As soon as the churchbells begin to ring, the bundles of twigs, fastened onPage 431"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"poles, are set on fire and the incense is ignited. Then all the house-bells and dinner-bells arerung, pots and pans are clashed, dogs bark, every one must make a noise. And amid thishubbub all scream at the pitch of their voices: “Witch flee, flee from here, or it will go ill with thee.” Then they run seven times round the houses, the yards, and the village. So the witches aresmoked out of their lurking-places and driven away. The custom of expelling the witches onWalpurgis Night is still, or was down to recent years, observed in many parts of Bavaria andamong the Germans of Bohemia. Thus in the Böhmer-wald Mountains all the young fellows ofthe village assemble after sunset on some height, especially at a cross-road, and crack whipsfor a while in unison with all their strength. This drives away the witches; for so far as thesound of the whips is heard, these maleficent beings can do no harm. In some places, whilethe young men are cracking their whips, the herdsmen wind their horns, and the long-drawnnotes, heard far off in the silence of night, are very effectual for banning the witches.Another witching time is the period of twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany. Hencein some parts of Silesia the people burn pine-resin all night long between Christmas and theNew Year in order that the pungent smoke may drive witches and evil spirits far away fromhouse and homestead; and on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve they fire shots over fieldsand meadows, into shrubs and trees, and wrap straw round the fruit-trees, to prevent the spir-its from doing them harm. On New Year’s Eve, which is Saint Sylvester’s Day, Bohemianlads, armed with guns, form themselves into circles and fire thrice into the air. This is called“Shooting the Witches” and is supposed to frighten the witches away. The last of the mystictwelve days is Epiphany or Twelfth Night, and it has been selected as a proper season for theexpulsion of the powers of evil in various parts of Europe. Thus at Brunnen, on the Lake ofLucerne, boys go about in procession on Twelfth Night carrying torches and making a greatnoise with horns, bells, whips, and so forth to frighten away two female spirits of the wood,Strudeli and Strätteli. The people think that if they do not make enough noise, there will be lit-tle fruit that year. Again, in Labruguière, a canton of Southern France, on the eve of TwelfthDay the people run through the streets, jangling bells, clattering kettles, and doing everythingto make a discordant noise. Then by the light of torches and blazing faggots they set up aprodigious hue and cry, an ear-splitting uproar, hoping thereby to chase all the wanderingghosts and devils from the town.Chapter LVIIPublic Scapegoats1. THE EXPULSION OF EMBODIED EVILSTHUS far we have dealt with that class of the general expulsion of evils which I have calleddirect or immediate. In this class the evils are invisible, at least to common eyes, and themode of deliverance consists for the most part in beating the empty air and raising such ahubbub as may scare the mischievous spirits and put them to flight. It remains to illustrate thesecond class of expulsions, in which the evil influences are embodied in a visible form or areat least supposed to be loaded upon a material medium, which acts as a vehicle to drawthem off from the people, village, or town.The Pomos of California celebrate an expulsion of devils every seven years, at which thedevils are represented by disguised men. “Twenty or thirty men array themselves in harlequinPage 432"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"rig and barbaric paint, and put vessels of pitch on their heads; then they secretly go out intothe surrounding mountains. These are to personify the devils. A herald goes up to the top ofthe assembly-house, and makes a speech to the multitude. At a signal agreed upon in theevening the masqueraders come in from the mountains, with the vessels of pitch flaming ontheir heads, and with all the frightful accessories of noise, motion, and costume which thesavage mind can devise in representation of demons. The terrified women and children fleefor life, the men huddle them inside a circle, and, on the principle of fighting the devil with fire,they swing blazing firebrands in the air, yell, whoop, and make frantic dashes at the maraud-ing and bloodthirsty devils, so creating a terrific spectacle, and striking great fear into thehearts of the assembled hundreds of women, who are screaming and fainting and clinging totheir valorous protectors. Finally the devils succeed in getting into the assembly-house, andthe bravest of the men enter and hold a parley with them. As a conclusion of the whole farce,the men summon courage, the devils are expelled from the assembly-house, and with aprodigious row and racket of sham fighting are chased away into the mountains.” In spring, assoon as the willow-leaves were full grown on the banks of the river, the Mandan Indians cele-brated their great annual festival, one of the features of which was the expulsion of the devil.Aman, painted black to represent the devil, entered the village from the prairie, chased andfrightened the women, and acted the part of a buffalo bull in the buffalo dance, the object ofwhich was to ensure a plentiful supply of buffaloes during the ensuing year. Finally he waschased from the village, the women pursuing him with hisses and gibes, beating him withsticks, and pelting him with dirt.Some of the native tribes of Central Queensland believe in a noxious being called Molonga,who prowls unseen and would kill men and violate women if certain ceremonies were not per-formed. These ceremonies last for five nights and consist of dances, in which only men, fan-tastically painted and adorned, take part. On the fifth night Molonga himself, personified by aman tricked out with red ochre and feathers and carrying a long feather-tipped spear, rushesforth from the darkness at the spectators and makes as if he would run them through. Greatis the excitement, loud are the shrieks and shouts, but after another feigned attack the demonvanishes in the gloom. On the last night of the year the palace of the Kings of Cambodia ispurged of devils. Men painted as fiends are chased by elephants about the palace courts.When they have been expelled, a consecrated thread of cotton is stretched round the palaceto keep them out. In Munzerabad, a district of Mysore in Southern India, when cholera orsmallpox has broken out in a parish, the inhabitants assemble and conjure the demon of thedisease into a wooden image, which they carry, generally at midnight, into the next parish.The inhabitants of that parish in like manner pass the image on to their neighbours, and thusthe demon is expelled from one village after another, until he comes to the bank of a river intowhich he is finally thrown.Oftener, however, the expelled demons are not represented at all, but are understood to bepresent invisibly in the material and visible vehicle which conveys them away. Here, again, itwill be convenient to distinguish between occasional and periodical expulsions. We begin withthe former.2. THE OCCASIONAL EXPULSION OF EVILS IN A MATERIAL VEHICLEThe vehicle which conveys away the demons may be of various kinds. A common one is a lit-tle ship or boat. Thus, in the southern district of the island of Ceram, when a whole villagesuffers from sickness, a small ship is made and filled with rice, tobacco, eggs, and so forth,which have been contributed by all the people. A little sail is hoisted on the ship. When all isPage 433"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"ready, a man calls out in a very loud voice, “O all ye sicknesses, ye smallpoxes, agues,measles, etc., who have visited us so long and wasted us so sorely, but who now cease toplague us, we have made ready this ship for you, and we have furnished you with provendersufficient for the voyage. Ye shall have no lack of food nor of betel-leaves nor of areca nutsnor of tobacco. Depart, and sail away from us directly; never come near us again; but go to aland which is far from here. Let all the tides and winds waft you speedily thither, and so con-vey you thither that for the time to come we may live sound and well, and that we may neversee the sun rise on you again.” Then ten or twelve men carry the vessel to the shore, and letit drift away with the land-breeze, feeling convinced that they are free from sickness for ever,or at least till the next time. If sickness attacks them again, they are sure it is not the samesickness, but a different one, which in due time they dismiss in the same manner. When thedemon-laden bark is lost to sight, the bearers return to the village, whereupon a man criesout, “The sicknesses are now gone, vanished, expelled, and sailed away.” At this all the peo-ple come running out of their houses, passing the word from one to the other with great joy,beating on gongs and on tinkling instruments.Similar ceremonies are commonly resorted to in other East Indian islands. Thus in Timor-laut,to mislead the demons who are causing sickness, a small proa, containing the image of aman and provisioned for a long voyage, is allowed to drift away with wind and tide. As it isbeing launched, the people cry, “O sickness, go from here; turn back; what do you here in thispoor land?” Three days after this ceremony a pig is killed, and part of the flesh is offered toDudilaa, who lives in the sun. One of the oldest men says, “Old sir, I beseech you make wellthe grand-children, children, women, and men, that we may be able to eat pork and rice andto drink palmwine. I will keep my promise. Eat your share, and make all the people in the vil-lage well.” If the proa is stranded at any inhabited spot, the sickness will break out there.Hence a stranded proa excites much alarm amongst the coast population, and they immedi-ately burn it, because demons fly from fire. In the island of Buru the proa which carries awaythe demons of disease is about twenty feet long, rigged out with sails, oars, anchor, and soon, and well stocked with provisions. For a day and a night the people beat gongs and drums,and rush about to frighten the demons. Next morning ten stalwart young men strike the peo-ple with branches, which have been previously dipped in an earthen pot of water. As soon asthey have done so, they run down to the beach, put the branches on board the proa, launchanother boat in great haste, and tow the disease-burdened bark far out to sea. There theycast it off, and one of them calls out, “Grandfather Smallpox, go away—go willingly away—govisit another land; we have made you food ready for the voyage, we have now nothing moreto give.” When they have landed, all the people bathe together in the sea. In this ceremonythe reason for striking the people with the branches is clearly to rid them of the disease-demons, which are then supposed to be transferred to the branches. Hence the haste withwhich the branches are deposited in the proa and towed away to sea. So in the inland dis-tricts of Ceram, when smallpox or other sickness is raging, the priest strikes all the houseswith consecrated branches, which are then thrown into the river, to be carried down to thesea; exactly as amongst the Wotyaks of Russia the sticks which have been used for expellingthe devils from the village are thrown into the river, that the current may sweep the balefulburden away. The plan of putting puppets in the boat to represent sick persons, in order tolure the demons after them, is not uncommon. For example, most of the pagan tribes on thecoast of Borneo seek to drive away epidemic disease as follows. They carve one or morerough human images from the pith of the sago palm and place them on a small raft or boat orfull-rigged Malay ship together with rice and other food. The boat is decked with blossoms ofthe areca palm and with ribbons made from its leaves, and thus adorned the little craft isallowed to float out to sea with the ebb-tide, bearing, as the people fondly think or hope, thePage 434"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"sickness away with it.Often the vehicle which carries away the collected demons or ills of a whole community is ananimal or scapegoat. In the Central Provinces of India, when cholera breaks out in a village,every one retires after sunset to his house. The priests then parade the streets, taking fromthe roof of each house a straw, which is burnt with an offering of rice, ghee, and turmeric, atsome shrine to the east of the village. Chickens daubed with vermilion are driven away in thedirection of the smoke, and are believed to carry the disease with them. If they fail, goats aretried, and last of all pigs. When cholera rages among the Bhars, Mallans, and Kurmis of India,they take a goat or a buffalo—in either case the animal must be a female, and as black aspossible—then having tied some grain, cloves, and red lead in a yellow cloth on its back theyturn it out of the village. The animal is conducted beyond the boundary and not allowed toreturn. Sometimes the buffalo is marked with a red pigment and driven to the next village,where he carries the plague with him.Amongst the Dinkas, a pastoral people of the White Nile, each family possesses a sacredcow. When the country is threatened with war, famine, or any other public calamity, the chiefsof the village require a particular family to surrender their sacred cow to serve as a scape-goat. The animal is driven by the women to the brink of the river and across it to the otherbank, there to wander in the wilderness and fall a prey to ravening beasts. Then the womenreturn in silence and without looking behind them; were they to cast a backward glance, theyimagine that the ceremony would have no effect. In 1857, when the Aymara Indians of Boliviaand Peru were suffering from a plague, they loaded a black llama with the clothes of theplague-stricken people, sprinkled brandy on the clothes, and then turned the animal loose onthe mountains, hoping that it would carry the pest away with it.Occasionally the scapegoat is a man. For example, from time to time the gods used to warnthe King of Uganda that his foes the Banyoro were working magic against him and his peopleto make them die of disease. To avert such a catastrophe the king would send a scapegoat tothe frontier of Bunyoro, the land of the enemy. The scapegoat consisted of either a man anda boy or a woman and her child, chosen because of some mark or bodily defect, which thegods had noted and by which the victims were to be recognised. With the human victimswere sent a cow, a goat, a fowl, and a dog; and a strong guard escorted them to the landwhich the god had indicated. There the limbs of the victims were broken and they were left todie a lingering death in the enemy’s country, being too crippled to crawl back to Uganda. Thedisease or plague was thought to have been thus transferred to the victims and to have beenconveyed back in their persons to the land from which it came.Some of the aboriginal tribes of China, as a protection against pestilence, select a man ofgreat muscular strength to act the part of scapegoat. Having besmeared his face with paint,he performs many antics with the view of enticing all pestilential and noxious influences toattach themselves to him only. He is assisted by a priest. Finally the scapegoat, hotly pursuedby men and women beating gongs and tom-toms, is driven with great haste out of the town orvillage. In the Punjaub a cure for the murrain is to hire a man of the Chamar caste, turn hisface away from the village, brand him with a red-hot sickle, and let him go out into the jungletaking the murrain with him. He must not look back.3. THE PERIODIC EXPULSION OF EVILS IN A MATERIAL VEHICLEThe mediate expulsion of evils by means of a scapegoat or other material vehicle, like thePage 435"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"immediate expulsion of them in invisible form, tends to become periodic, and for a like rea-son. Thus every year, generally in March, the people of Leti, Moa, and Lakor, islands of theIndian Archipelago, send away all their diseases to sea. They make a proa about six feetlong, rig it with sails, oars, rudder, and other gear, and every family deposits in its some rice,fruit, a fowl, two eggs, insects that ravage the fields, and so on. Then they let it drift away tosea, saying, “Take away from here all kinds of sickness, take them to other islands, to otherlands, distribute them in places that lie eastward, where the sun rises.” The Biajas of Borneoannually send to sea a little bark laden with the sins and misfortunes of the people. The crewof any ship that falls in with the ill-omened bark at sea will suffer all the sorrows with which itis laden. A like custom is annually observed by the Dusuns of the Tuaran district in BritishNorth Borneo. The ceremony is the most important of the whole year. Its aim is to bring goodluck to the village during the ensuing year by solemnly expelling all the evil spirits that mayhave collected in or about the houses throughout the last twelve months. The task of routingout the demons and banishing them devolves chiefly on women. Dressed in their finest array,they go in procession through the village. One of them carries a small sucking pig in a basketon her back; and all of them bear wands, with which they belabour the little pig at the appro-priate moment; its squeals help to attract the vagrant spirits. At every house the womendance and sing, clashing castanets or cymbals of brass and jingling bunches of little brassbells in both hands. When the performance has been repeated at every house in the village,the procession defiles down to the river, and all the evil spirits, which the performers havechased from the houses, follow them to the edge of the water. There a raft has been madeready and moored to the bank. It contains offerings of food, cloth, cooking-pots, and swords;and the deck is crowded with figures of men, women, animals, and birds, all made out of theleaves of the sago palm. The evil spirits now embark on the raft, and when they are allaboard, it is pushed off and allowed to float down with the current, carrying the demons withit. Should the raft run aground near the village, it is shoved off with all speed, lest the invisiblepassengers should seize the opportunity of landing and returning to the village. Finally, thesufferings of the little pig, whose squeals served to decoy the demons from their lurking-places, are terminated by death, for it is killed and its carcase thrown away.Every year, at the beginning of the dry season, the Nicobar Islanders carry the model of aship through their villages. The devils are chased out of the huts, and driven on board the lit-tle ship, which is then launched and suffered to sail away with the wind. The ceremony hasbeen described by a catechist, who witnessed it at Car Nicobar in July 1897. For three daysthe people were busy preparing two very large floating cars, shaped like canoes, fitted withsails, and loaded with certain leaves, which possessed the valuable property of expelling dev-ils. While the young people were thus engaged, the exorcists and the elders sat in a housesinging songs by turns; but often they would come forth, pace the beach armed with rods,and forbid the devil to enter the village. The fourth day of the solemnity bore a name whichmeans “Expelling the Devil by Sails.” In the evening all the villagers assembled, the womenbringing baskets of ashes and bunches of devil-expelling leaves. These leaves were then dis-tributed to everybody, old and young. When all was ready, a band of robust men, attended bya guard of exorcists, carried one of the cars down to the sea on the right side of the villagegraveyard, and set it floating in the water. As soon as they had returned, another band of mencarried the other car to the beach and floated it similarly in the sea to the left of the grave-yard. The demon-laden barks being now launched, the women threw ashes from the shore,and the whole crowd shouted, saying, “Fly away, devil, fly away, never come again!” The windand the tide being favourable, the canoes sailed quickly away; and that night all the peoplefeasted together with great joy, because the devil had departed in the direction of Chowra. Asimilar expulsion of devils takes place once a year in other Nicobar villages; but the cere-Page 436"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"monies are held at different times in different places.Amongst many of the aboriginal tribes of China, a great festival is celebrated in the thirdmonth of every year. It is held by way of a general rejoicing over what the people believe tobe a total annihilation of the ills of the past twelve months. The destruction is supposed to beeffected in the following way. A large earthenware jar filled with gunpowder, stones, and bitsof iron is buried in the earth. A train of gunpowder, communicating with the jar, is then laid;and a match being applied, the jar and its contents are blown up. The stones and bits of ironrepresent the ills and disasters of the past year, and the dispersion of them by the explosionis believed to remove the ills and disasters themselves. The festival is attended with muchrevelling and drunkenness.At Old Calabar on the coast of Guinea, the devils and ghosts are, or used to be, publiclyexpelled once in two years. Among the spirits thus driven from their haunts are the souls of allthe people who died since the last lustration of the town. About three weeks or a monthbefore the expulsion, which according to one account takes place in the month of November,rude effigies representing men and animals, such as crocodiles, leopards, elephants, bul-locks, and birds, are made of wicker-work or wood, and being hung with strips of cloth andbedizened with gew-gaws, are set before the door of every house. About three o’clock in themorning of the day appointed for the ceremony the whole population turns out into thestreets, and proceeds with a deafening uproar and in a state of the wildest excitement todrive all lurking devils and ghosts into the effigies, in order that they may be banished withthem from the abodes of men. For this purpose bands of people roam through the streetsknocking on doors, firing guns, beating drums, blowing on horns, ringing bells, clattering potsand pans, shouting and hallooing with might and main, in short making all the noise it is pos-sible for them to raise. The hubbub goes on till the approach of dawn, when it gradually sub-sides and ceases altogether at sunrise. By this time the houses have been thoroughly swept,and all the frightened spirits are supposed to have huddled into the effigies or their flutteringdrapery. In these wicker figures are also deposited the sweepings of the houses and theashes of yesterday’s fires. Then the demon-laden images are hastily snatched up, carried intumultuous procession down to the brink of the river, and thrown into the water to the tuck ofdrums. The ebb-tide bears them away seaward, and thus the town is swept clean of ghostsand devils for another two years.Similar annual expulsions of embodied evils are not unknown in Europe. On the evening ofEaster Sunday the gypsies of Southern Europe take a wooden vessel like a band-box, whichrests cradle-wise on two cross pieces of wood. In this they place herbs and simples, togetherwith the dried carcase of a snake, or lizard, which every person present must first havetouched with his fingers. The vessel is then wrapt in white and red wool, carried by the oldestman from tent to tent, and finally thrown into running water, not, however, before every mem-ber of the band has spat into it once, and the sorceress has uttered some spells over it. Theybelieve that by performing this ceremony they dispel all the illnesses that would otherwisehave afflicted them in the course of the year; and that if any one finds the vessel and opens itout of curiosity, he and his will be visited by all the maladies which the others have escaped.The scapegoat by means of which the accumulated ills of a whole year are publicly expelledis sometimes an animal. For example, among the Garos of Assam, “besides the sacrifices forindividual cases of illness, there are certain ceremonies which are observed once a year by awhole community or village, and are intended to safeguard its members from dangers of theforest, and from sickness and mishap during the coming twelve months. The principal ofPage 437"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"these is the Asongtata ceremony. Close to the outskirts of every big village a number ofstones may be noticed stuck into the ground, apparently without order or method. These areknown by the name of asong, and on them is offered the sacrifice which the Asongtatademands. The sacrifice of a goat takes place, and a month later, that of a langur (Entellusmonkey) or a bamboo-rat is considered necessary. The animal chosen has a rope fastenedround its neck and is led by two men, one on each side of it, to every house in the village. Itis taken inside each house in turn, the assembled villagers, meanwhile, beating the wallsfrom the outside, to frighten and drive out any evil spirits which may have taken up their resi-dence within. The round of the village having been made in this manner, the monkey or rat isled to the outskirts of the village, killed by a blow of a dao, which disembowels it, and thencrucified on bamboos set up in the ground. Round the crucified animal long, sharp bamboostakes are placed, which form chevaux de frise round about it. These commemorate the dayswhen such defences surrounded the villages on all sides to keep off human enemies, andthey are now a symbol to ward off sickness and dangers to life from the wild animals of theforest. The langur required for the purpose is hunted down some days before, but should it befound impossible to catch one, a brown monkey may take its place; a hulock may not beused.” Here the crucified ape or rat is the public scapegoat, which by its vicarious sufferingsand death relieves the people from all sickness and mishap in the coming year.Again, on one day of the year the Bhotiyas of Juhar, in the Western Himalayas, take a dog,intoxicate him with spirits and bhang or hemp, and having fed him with sweetmeats, lead himround the village and let him loose. They then chase and kill him with sticks and stones, andbelieve that, when they have done so, no disease or misfortune will visit the village during theyear. In some parts of Breadalbane it was formerly the custom on New Year’s Day to take adog to the door, give him a bit of bread, and drive him out, saying, “Get away, you dog!Whatever death of men or loss of cattle would happen in this house to the end of the presentyear, may it all light on your head!” On the Day of Atonement, which was the tenth day of theseventh month, the Jewish high-priest laid both his hands on the head of a live goat, con-fessed over it all the iniquities of the Children of Israel, and, having thereby transferred thesins of the people to the beast, sent it away into the wilderness.The scapegoat upon whom the sins of the people are periodically laid, may also be a humanbeing. At Onitsha, on the Niger, two human beings used to be annually sacrificed to takeaway the sins of the land. The victims were purchased by public subscription. All personswho, during the past year, had fallen into gross sins, such as incendiarism, theft, adultery,witchcraft, and so forth, were expected to contribute 28 ngugas, or a little over £2. The moneythus collected was taken into the interior of the country and expended in the purchase of twosickly persons “to be offered as a sacrifice for all these abominable crimes—one for the landand one for the river.” A man from a neighbouring town was hired to put them to death. Onthe twenty-seventh of February 1858 the Rev. J. C. Taylor witnessed the sacrifice of one ofthese victims. The sufferer was a woman, about nineteen or twenty years of age. Theydragged her alive along the ground, face downwards, from the king’s house to the river, a dis-tance of two miles, the crowds who accompanied her crying, “Wickedness! wickedness!” Theintention was “to take away the iniquities of the land. The body was dragged along in a merci-less manner, as if the weight of all their wickedness was thus carried away.” Similar customsare said to be still secretly practised every year by many tribes in the delta of the Niger inspite of the vigilance of the British Government. Among the Yoruba negroes of West Africa“the human victim chosen for sacrifice, and who may be either a freeborn or a slave, a personof noble or wealthy parentage, or one of humble birth, is, after he has been chosen andmarked out for the purpose, called an Oluwo. He is always well fed and nourished and sup-Page 438"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"plied with whatever he should desire during the period of his confinement. When the occasionarrives for him to be sacrificed and offered up, he is commonly led about and paradedthrough the streets of the town or city of the Sovereign who would sacrifice him for the well-being of his government and of every family and individual under it, in order that he mightcarry off the sin, guilt, misfortune and death of all without exception. Ashes and chalk wouldbe employed to hide his identity by the one being freely thrown over his head, and his facepainted with the latter, whilst individuals would often rush out of their houses to lay theirhands upon him that they might thus transfer to him their sin, guilt, trouble, and death.” Thisparade over, he is taken to an inner sanctuary and beheaded. His last words or dying groansare the signal for an outburst of joy among the people assembled outside, who believe thatthe sacrifice has been accepted and the divine wrath appeased.In Siam it used to be the custom on one day of the year to single out a woman broken downby debauchery, and carry her on a litter through all the streets to the music of drums andhautboys. The mob insulted her and pelted her with dirt; and after having carried her throughthe whole city, they threw her on a dunghill or a hedge of thorns outside the ramparts, forbid-ding her ever to enter the walls again. They believed that the woman thus drew upon herselfall the malign influences of the air and of evil spirits. The Bataks of Sumatra offer either a redhorse or a buffalo as a public sacrifice to purify the land and obtain the favour of the gods.Formerly, it is said, a man was bound to the same stake as the buffalo, and when they killedthe animal, the man was driven away; no one might receive him, converse with him, or givehim food. Doubtless he was supposed to carry away the sins and misfortunes of the people.Sometimes the scapegoat is a divine animal. The people of Malabar share the Hindoo rever-ence for the cow, to kill and eat which “they esteem to be a crime as heinous as homicide orwilful murder.” Nevertheless the “Bramans transfer the sins of the people into one or moreCows, which are then carry’d away, both the Cows and the Sins wherewith these Beasts arecharged, to what place the Braman shall appoint.” When the ancient Egyptians sacrificed abull, they invoked upon its head all the evils that might otherwise befall themselves and theland of Egypt, and thereupon they either sold the bull’s head to the Greeks or cast it into theriver. Now, it cannot be said that in the times known to us the Egyptians worshipped bulls ingeneral, for they seem to have commonly killed and eaten them. But a good many circum-stances point to the conclusion that originally all cattle, bulls as well as cows, were heldsacred by the Egyptians. For not only were all cows esteemed holy by them and never sacri-ficed, but even bulls might not be sacrificed unless they had certain natural marks; a priestexamined every bull before it was sacrificed; if it had the proper marks, he put his seal on theanimal in token that it might be sacrificed; and if a man sacrificed a bull which had not beensealed, he was put to death. Moreover, the worship of the black bulls Apis and Mnevis, espe-cially the former, played an important part in Egyptian religion; all bulls that died a naturaldeath were carefully buried in the suburbs of the cities, and their bones were afterwards col-lected from all parts of Egypt and interred in a single spot; and at the sacrifice of a bull in thegreat rites of Isis all the worshippers beat their breasts and mourned. On the whole, then, weare perhaps entitled to infer that bulls were originally, as cows were always, esteemed sacredby the Egyptians, and that the slain bull upon whose head they laid the misfortunes of thepeople was once a divine scapegoat. It seems not improbable that the lamb annually slain bythe Madis of Central Africa is a divine scapegoat, and the same supposition may partlyexplain the Zuni sacrifice of the turtle.Lastly, the scapegoat may be a divine man. Thus, in November the Gonds of India worshipGhansyam Deo, the protector of the crops, and at the festival the god himself is said toPage 439"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"descend on the head of one of the worshippers, who is suddenly seized with a kind of fit and,after staggering about, rushes off into the jungle, where it is believed that, if left to himself, hewould die mad. However, they bring him back, but he does not recover his senses for one ortwo days. The people think that one man is thus singled out as a scapegoat for the sins of therest of the village. In the temple of the Moon the Albanians of the Eastern Caucasus kept anumber of sacred slaves, of whom many were inspired and prophesied. When one of thesemen exhibited more than usual symptoms of inspiration or insanity, and wandered solitary upand down the woods, like the Gond in the jungle, the high priest had him bound with a sacredchain and maintained him in luxury for a year. At the end of the year he was anointed withunguents and led forth to be sacrificed. A man whose business it was to slay these humanvictims and to whom practice had given dexterity, advanced from the crowd and thrust asacred spear into the victim’s side, piercing his heart. From the manner in which the slainman fell, omens were drawn as to the welfare of the commonwealth. Then the body was car-ried to a certain spot where all the people stood upon it as a purificatory ceremony. This lastcircumstance clearly indicates that the sins of the people were transferred to the victim, justas the Jewish priest transferred the sins of the people to the scapegoat by laying his handson the animal’s head; and since the man was believed to be possessed by the divine spirit,we have here an undoubted example of a man-god slain to take away the sins and misfor-tunes of the people.In Tibet the ceremony of the scapegoat presents some remarkable features. The Tibetan newyear begins with the new moon which appears about the fifteenth of February. For twenty-three days afterwards the government of Lhasa, the capital, is taken out of the hands of theordinary rulers and entrusted to the monk of the Debang monastery who offers to pay thehighest sum for the privilege. The successful bidder is called the Jalno, and he announces hisaccession to power in person, going through the streets of Lhasa with a silver stick in hishand. Monks from all the neighbouring monasteries and temples assemble to pay him hom-age. The Jalno exercises his authority in the most arbitrary manner for his own benefit, as allthe fines which he exacts are his by purchase. The profit he makes is about ten times theamount of the purchase money. His men go about the streets in order to discover any con-duct on the part of the inhabitants that can be found fault with. Every house in Lhasa is taxedat this time, and the slightest offence is punished with unsparing rigour by fines. This severityof the Jalno drives all working classes out of the city till the twenty-three days are over. But ifthe laity go out, the clergy come in. All the Buddhist monasteries of the country for milesround about open their gates and disgorge their inmates. All the roads that lead down intoLhasa from the neighbouring mountains are full of monks hurrying to the capital, some onfoot, some on horseback, some riding asses or lowing oxen, all carrying their prayer-booksand culinary utensils. In such multitudes do they come that the streets and squares of the cityare encumbered with their swarms, and incarnadined with their red cloaks. The disorder andconfusion are indescribable. Bands of the holy men traverse the streets chanting prayers, oruttering wild cries. They meet, they jostle, they quarrel, they fight; bloody noses, black eyes,and broken heads are freely given and received. All day long, too, from before the peep ofdawn till after darkness has fallen, these red-cloaked monks hold services in the dim incense-laden air of the great Machindranath temple, the cathedral of Lhasa; and thither they crowdthrice a day to receive their doles of tea and soup and money. The cathedral is a vast build-ing, standing in the centre of the city, and surrounded by bazaars and shops. The idols in itare richly inlaid with gold and precious stones.Twenty-four days after the Jalno has ceased to have authority, he assumes it again, and forten days acts in the same arbitrary manner as before. On the first of the ten days the priestsPage 440"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"again assemble at the cathedral, pray to the gods to prevent sickness and other evils amongthe people, “and, as a peace-offering, sacrifice one man. The man is not killed purposely, butthe ceremony he undergoes often proves fatal. Grain is thrown against his head, and his faceis painted half white, half black.” Thus grotesquely disguised, and carrying a coat of skin onhis arm, he is called the King of the Years, and sits daily in the market-place, where he helpshimself to whatever he likes and goes about shaking a black yak’s tail over the people, whothus transfer their bad luck to him. On the tenth day, all the troops in Lhasa march to thegreat temple and form in line before it. The King of the Years is brought forth from the templeand receives small donations from the assembled multitude. He then ridicules the Jalno, say-ing to him, “What we perceive through the five senses is no illusion. All you teach is untrue,”and the like. The Jalno, who represents the Grand Lama for the time being, contests theseheretical opinions; the dispute waxes warm, and at last both agree to decide the questions atissue by a cast of the dice, the Jalno offering to change places with the scapegoat should thethrow be against him. If the King of the Years wins, much evil is prognosticated; but if theJalno wins, there is great rejoicing, for it proves that his adversary has been accepted by thegods as a victim to bear all the sins of the people of Lhasa. Fortune, however, always favoursthe Jalno, who throws sixes with unvarying success, while his opponent turns up only ones.Nor is this so extraordinary as at first sight it might appear; for the Jalno’s dice are markedwith nothing but sixes and his adversary’s with nothing but ones. When he sees the finger ofProvidence thus plainly pointed against him, the King of the Years is terrified and flees awayupon a white horse, with a white dog, a white bird, salt, and so forth, which have all been pro-vided for him by the government. His face is still painted half white and half black, and he stillwears his leathern coat. The whole populace pursues him, hooting, yelling, and firing blankshots in volleys after him. Thus driven out of the city, he is detained for seven days in thegreat chamber of horrors at the Samyas monastery, surrounded by monstrous and terrificimages of devils and skins of huge serpents and wild beasts. Thence he goes away into themountains of Chetang, where he has to remain an outcast for several months or a year in anarrow den. If he dies before the time is out, the people say it is an auspicious omen; but ifhe survives, he may return to Lhasa and play the part of scapegoat over again the followingyear.This quaint ceremonial, still annually observed in the secluded capital of Buddhism—theRome of Asia—is interesting because it exhibits, in a clearly marked religious stratification, aseries of divine redeemers themselves redeemed, of vicarious sacrifices vicariously atonedfor, of gods undergoing a process of fossilisation, who, while they retain the privileges, havedisburdened themselves of the pains and penalties of divinity. In the Jalno we may withoutundue straining discern a successor of those temporary kings, those mortal gods, who pur-chase a short lease of power and glory at the price of their lives. That he is the temporarysubstitute of the Grand Lama is certain; that he is, or was once, liable to act as scapegoat forthe people is made nearly certain by his offer to change places with the real scapegoat—theKing of the Years—if the arbitrament of the dice should go against him. It is true that the con-ditions under which the question is now put to the hazard have reduced the offer to an idleform. But such forms are no mere mushroom growths, springing up of themselves in a night.If they are now lifeless formalities, empty husks devoid of significance, we may be sure thatthey once had a life and a meaning; if at the present day they are blind alleys leadingnowhere, we may be certain that in former days they were paths that led somewhere, if onlyto death. That death was the goal to which of old the Tibetan scapegoat passed after his briefperiod of licence in the market-place, is a conjecture that has much to commend it. Analogysuggests it; the blank shots fired after him, the statement that the ceremony often provesfatal, the belief that his death is a happy omen, all confirm it. We need not wonder then thatPage 441"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"the Jalno, after paying so dear to act as deputy-deity for a few weeks, should have preferredto die by deputy rather than in his own person when his time was up. The painful but neces-sary duty was accordingly laid on some poor devil, some social outcast, some wretch withwhom the world had gone hard, who readily agreed to throw away his life at the end of a fewdays if only he might have his fling in the meantime. For observe that while the time allowedto the original deputy—the Jalno—was measured by weeks, the time allowed to the deputy’sdeputy was cut down to days, ten days according to one authority, seven days according toanother. So short a rope was doubtless thought a long enough tether for so black or sickly asheep; so few sands in the hour-glass, slipping so fast away, sufficed for one who had wastedso many precious years. Hence in the jack-pudding who now masquerades with motley coun-tenance in the market-place of Lhasa, sweeping up misfortune with a black yak’s tail, we mayfairly see the substitute of a substitute, the vicar of a vicar, the proxy on whose back theheavy burden was laid when it had been lifted from nobler shoulders. But the clue, if we havefollowed it aright, does not stop at the Jalno; it leads straight back to the pope of Lhasa him-self, the Grand Lama, of whom the Jalno is merely the temporary vicar. The analogy of manycustoms in many lands points to the conclusion that, if this human divinity stoops to resign hisghostly power for a time into the hands of a substitute, it is, or rather was once, for no otherreason than that the substitute might die in his stead. Thus through the mist of ages unillu-mined by the lamp of history, the tragic figure of the pope of Buddhism—God’s vicar on earthfor Asia—looms dim and sad as the man-god who bore his people’s sorrows, the GoodShepherd who laid down his life for the sheep.4. ON SCAPEGOATS IN GENERALThe foregoing survey of the custom of publicly expelling the accumulated evils of a village ortown or country suggests a few general observations.In the first place, it will not be disputed that what I have called the immediate and the mediateexpulsions of evil are identical in intention; in other words, that whether the evils are con-ceived of as invisible or as embodied in a material form, is a circumstance entirely subordi-nate to the main object of the ceremony, which is simply to effect a total clearance of all theills that have been infesting a people. If any link were wanting to connect the two kinds ofexpulsion, it would be furnished by such a practice as that of sending the evils away in a litteror a boat. For here, on the one hand, the evils are invisible and intangible; and, on the otherhand, there is a visible and tangible vehicle to convey them away. And a scapegoat is nothingmore than such a vehicle.In the second place, when a general clearance of evils is resorted to periodically, the intervalbetween the celebrations of the ceremony is commonly a year, and the time of year when theceremony takes place usually coincides with some well-marked change of season, such asthe beginning or end of winter in the arctic and temperate zones, and the beginning or end ofthe rainy season in the tropics. The increased mortality which such climatic changes are aptto produce, especially amongst ill-fed, ill-clothed, and ill-housed savages, is set down by prim-itive man to the agency of demons, who must accordingly be expelled. Hence, in the tropicalregions of New Britain and Peru, the devils are or were driven out at the beginning of therainy season; hence, on the dreary coasts of Baffin Land, they are banished at the approachof the bitter Arctic winter. When a tribe has taken to husbandry, the time for the general expul-sion of devils is naturally made to agree with one of the great epochs of the agricultural year,as sowing, or harvest; but, as these epochs themselves naturally coincide with changes ofseason, it does not follow that the transition from the hunting or pastoral to the agricultural lifePage 442"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"involves any alteration in the time of celebrating this great annual rite. Some of the agricultur-al communities of India and the Hindoo Koosh, as we have seen, hold their general clearanceof demons at harvest, others at sowing-time. But, at whatever season of the year it is held,the general expulsion of devils commonly marks the beginning of the new year. For, beforeentering on a new year, people are anxious to rid themselves of the troubles that haveharassed them in the past; hence it comes about that in so many communities the beginningof the new year is inaugurated with a solemn and public banishment of evil spirits.In the third place, it is to be observed that this public and periodic expulsion of devils is com-monly preceded or followed by a period of general license, during which the ordinaryrestraints of society are thrown aside, and all offences, short of the gravest, are allowed topass unpunished. In Guinea and Tonquin the period of license precedes the public expulsionof demons; and the suspension of the ordinary government in Lhasa previous to the expul-sion of the scapegoat is perhaps a relic of a similar period of universal license. Amongst theHos of India the period of license follows the expulsion of the devil. Amongst the Iroquois ithardly appears whether it preceded or followed the banishment of evils. In any case, theextraordinary relaxation of all ordinary rules of conduct on such occasions is doubtless to beexplained by the general clearance of evils which precedes or follows it. On the one hand,when a general riddance of evil and absolution from all sin is in immediate prospect, men areencouraged to give the rein to their passions, trusting that the coming ceremony will wipe outthe score which they are running up so fast. On the other hand, when the ceremony has justtaken place, men’s minds are freed from the oppressive sense, under which they generallylabour, of an atmosphere surcharged with devils; and in the first revulsion of joy they overleapthe limits commonly imposed by custom and morality. When the ceremony takes place at har-vest-time, the elation of feeling which it excites is further stimulated by the state of physicalwellbeing produced by an abundant supply of food.Fourthly, the employment of a divine man or animal as a scapegoat is especially to be noted;indeed, we are here directly concerned with the custom of banishing evils only in so far asthese evils are believed to be transferred to a god who is afterwards slain. It may be suspect-ed that the custom of employing a divine man or animal as a public scapegoat is much morewidely diffused than appears from the examples cited. For, as has already been pointed out,the custom of killing a god dates from so early a period of human history that in later ages,even when the custom continues to be practised, it is liable to be misinterpreted. The divinecharacter of the animal or man is forgotten, and he comes to be regarded merely as an ordi-nary victim. This is especially likely to be the case when it is a divine man who is killed. Forwhen a nation becomes civilised, if it does not drop human sacrifices altogether, it at leastselects as victims only such wretches as would be put to death at any rate. Thus the killing ofa god may sometimes come to be confounded with the execution of a criminal.If we ask why a dying god should be chosen to take upon himself and carry away the sinsand sorrows of the people, it may be suggested that in the practice of using the divinity as ascapegoat we have a combination of two customs which were at one time distinct and inde-pendent. On the one hand we have seen that it has been customary to kill the human or ani-mal god in order to save his divine life from being weakened by the inroads of age. On theother hand we have seen that it has been customary to have a general expulsion of evils andsins once a year. Now, if it occurred to people to combine these two customs, the resultwould be the employment of the dying god as a scapegoat. He was killed, not originally totake away sin, but to save the divine life from the degeneracy of old age; but, since he had tobe killed at any rate, people may have thought that they might as well seize the opportunity toPage 443"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"lay upon him the burden of their sufferings and sins, in order that he might bear it away withhim to the unknown world beyond the grave.The use of the divinity as a scapegoat clears up the ambiguity which, as we saw, appears tohang about the European folk-custom of “carrying out Death.” Grounds have been shown forbelieving that in this ceremony the so-called Death was originally the spirit of vegetation, whowas annually slain in spring, in order that he might come to life again with all the vigour ofyouth. But, as I pointed out, there are certain features in the ceremony which are not explica-ble on this hypothesis alone. Such are the marks of joy with which the effigy of Death is car-ried out to be buried or burnt, and the fear and abhorrence of it manifested by the bearers.But these features become at once intelligible if we suppose that the Death was not merelythe dying god of vegetation, but also a public scapegoat, upon whom were laid all the evilsthat had afflicted the people during the past year. Joy on such an occasion is natural andappropriate; and if the dying god appears to be the object of that fear and abhorrence whichare properly due not to himself, but to the sins and misfortunes with which he is laden, thisarises merely from the difficulty of distinguishing, or at least of marking the distinction,between the bearer and the burden. When the burden is of a baleful character, the bearer ofit will be feared and shunned just as much as if he were himself instinct with those dangerousproperties of which, as it happens, he is only the vehicle. Similarly we have seen that dis-ease-laden and sin-laden boats are dreaded and shunned by East Indian peoples. Again, theview that in these popular customs the Death is a scapegoat as well as a representative ofthe divine spirit of vegetation derives some support from the circumstance that its expulsion isalways celebrated in spring and chiefly by Slavonic peoples. For the Slavonic year began inspring; and thus, in one of its aspects, the ceremony of “carrying out Death” would be anexample of the widespread custom of expelling the accumulated evils of the old year beforeentering on a new one.Chapter LVIIIHuman Scapegoats in Classical Antiquity1. THE HUMAN SCAPEGOAT IN ANCIENT ROMEWE are now prepared to notice the use of the human scapegoat in classical antiquity. Everyyear on the fourteenth of March a man clad in skins was led in procession through the streetsof Rome, beaten with long white rods, and driven out of the city. He was called MamuriusVeturius, that is, “the old Mars,” and as the ceremony took place on the day preceding thefirst full moon of the old Roman year (which began on the first of March), the skin-clad manmust have represented the Mars of the past year, who was driven out at the beginning of anew one. Now Mars was originally not a god of war but of vegetation. For it was to Mars thatthe Roman husbandman prayed for the prosperity of his corn and his vines, his fruit-trees andhis copses; it was to Mars that the priestly college of the Arval Brothers, whose business itwas to sacrifice for the growth of the crops, addressed their petitions almost exclusively; andit was to Mars, as we saw, that a horse was sacrificed in October to secure an abundant har-vest. Moreover, it was to Mars, under his title of “Mars of the woods” (Mars Silvanus), thatfarmers offered sacrifice for the welfare of their cattle. We have already seen that cattle arecommonly supposed to be under the special patronage of tree-gods. Once more, the conse-cration of the vernal month of March to Mars seems to point him out as the deity of thesprouting vegetation. Thus the Roman custom of expelling the old Mars at the beginning ofthe new year in spring is identical with the Slavonic custom of “carrying out Death,” if the viewhere taken of the latter custom is correct. The similarity of the Roman and Slavonic customsPage 444"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"has been already remarked by scholars, who appear, however, to have taken MamuriusVeturius and the corresponding figures in the Slavonic ceremonies to be representatives ofthe old year rather than of the old god of vegetation. It is possible that ceremonies of this kindmay have come to be thus interpreted in later times even by the people who practised them.But the personification of a period of time is too abstract an idea to be primitive. However, inthe Roman, as in the Slavonic, ceremony, the representative of the god appears to have beentreated not only as a deity of vegetation but also as a scapegoat. His expulsion implies this;for there is no reason why the god of vegetation, as such, should be expelled the city. But it isotherwise if he is also a scapegoat; it then becomes necessary to drive him beyond theboundaries, that he may carry his sorrowful burden away to other lands. And, in fact,Mamurius Veturius appears to have been driven away to the land of the Oscans, the enemiesof Rome.2. THE HUMAN SCAPEGOAT IN ANCIENT GREECEThe ancient Greeks were also familiar with the use of a human scapegoat. In Plutarch’snative town of Chaeronea a ceremony of this kind was performed by the chief magistrate atthe Town Hall, and by each householder at his own home. It was called the “expulsion ofhunger.” A slave was beaten with rods of the agnus castus, and turned out of doors with thewords, “Out with hunger, and in with wealth and health.” When Plutarch held the office ofchief magistrate of his native town he performed this ceremony at the Town Hall, and he hasrecorded the discussion to which the custom afterwards gave rise.But in civilised Greece the custom of the scapegoat took darker forms than the innocent riteover which the amiable and pious Plutarch presided. Whenever Marseilles, one of the busiestand most brilliant of Greek colonies, was ravaged by a plague, a man of the poorer classesused to offer himself as a scapegoat. For a whole year he was maintained at the publicexpense, being fed on choice and pure food. At the expiry of the year he was dressed insacred garments, decked with holy branches, and led through the whole city, while prayerswere uttered that all the evils of the people might fall on his head. He was then cast out of thecity or stoned to death by the people outside of the walls. The Athenians regularly maintaineda number of degraded and useless beings at the public expense; and when any calamity,such as plague, drought, or famine, befell the city, they sacrificed two of these outcast scape-goats. One of the victims was sacrificed for the men and the other for the women. The formerwore round his neck a string of black, the latter a string of white figs. Sometimes, it seems,the victim slain on behalf of the women was a woman. They were led about the city and thensacrificed, apparently by being stoned to death outside the city. But such sacrifices were notconfined to extraordinary occasions of public calamity; it appears that every year, at the festi-val of the Thargelia in May, two victims, one for the men and one for the women, were led outof Athens and stoned to death. The city of Abdera in Thrace was publicly purified once a year,and one of the burghers, set apart for the purpose, was stoned to death as a scapegoat orvicarious sacrifice for the life of all the others; six days before his execution he was excom-municated, “in order that he alone might bear the sins of all the people.”From the Lover’s Leap, a white bluff at the southern end of their island, the Leucadians usedannually to hurl a criminal into the sea as a scapegoat. But to lighten his fall they fastenedlive birds and feathers to him, and a flotilla of small boats waited below to catch him and con-vey him beyond the boundary. Probably these humane precautions were a mitigation of anearlier custom of flinging the scapegoat into the sea to drown. The Leucadian ceremony tookplace at the time of a sacrifice to Apollo, who had a temple or sanctuary on the spot.Page 445"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"Elsewhere it was customary to cast a young man every year into the sea, with the prayer, “Bethou our offscouring.” This ceremony was supposed to rid the people of the evils by whichthey were beset, or according to a somewhat different interpretation it redeemed them bypaying the debt they owed to the sea-god. As practised by the Greeks of Asia Minor in thesixth century before our era, the custom of the scapegoat was as follows. When a city suf-fered from plague, famine, or other public calamity, an ugly or deformed person was chosento take upon himself all the evils which afflicted the community. He was brought to a suitableplace, where dried figs, a barley loaf, and cheese were put into his hand. These he ate. Thenhe was beaten seven times upon his genital organs with squills and branches of the wild figand other wild trees, while the flutes played a particular tune. Afterwards he was burned on apyre built of the wood of forest trees; and his ashes were cast into the sea. A similar customappears to have been annually celebrated by the Asiatic Greeks at the harvest festival of theThargelia.In the ritual just described the scourging of the victim with squills, branches of the wild fig,and so forth, cannot have been intended to aggravate his sufferings, otherwise any stickwould have been good enough to beat him with. The true meaning of this part of the ceremo-ny has been explained by W. Mannhardt. He points out that the ancients attributed to squills amagical power of averting evil influences, and that accordingly they hung them up at thedoors of their houses and made use of them in purificatory rites. Hence the Arcadian customof whipping the image of Pan with squills at a festival, or whenever the hunters returnedempty-handed, must have been meant, not to punish the god, but to purify him from theharmful influences which were impeding him in the exercise of his divine functions as a godwho should supply the hunter with game. Similarly the object of beating the human scapegoaton the genital organs with squills and so on, must have been to release his reproductiveenergies from any restraint or spell under which they might be laid by demoniacal or othermalignant agency; and as the Thargelia at which he was annually sacrificed was an early har-vest festival celebrated in May, we must recognise in him a representative of the creative andfertilising god of vegetation. The representative of the god was annually slain for the purposeI have indicated, that of maintaining the divine life in perpetual vigour, untainted by the weak-ness of age; and before he was put to death it was not unnatural to stimulate his reproductivepowers in order that these might be transmitted in full activity to his successor, the new godor new embodiment of the old god, who was doubtless supposed immediately to take theplace of the one slain. Similar reasoning would lead to a similar treatment of the scapegoaton special occasions, such as drought or famine. If the crops did not answer to the expecta-tion of the husbandman, this would be attributed to some failure in the generative powers ofthe god whose function it was to produce the fruits of the earth. It might be thought that hewas under a spell or was growing old and feeble. Accordingly he was slain in the person ofhis representative, with all the ceremonies already described, in order that, born young again,he might infuse his own youthful vigour into the stagnant energies of nature. On the sameprinciple we can understand why Mamurius Veturius was beaten with rods, why the slave atthe Chaeronean ceremony was beaten with the agnus castus (a tree to which magical prop-erties were ascribed), why the effigy of Death in some parts of Europe is assailed with sticksand stones, and why at Babylon the criminal who played the god scourged before he wascrucified. The purpose of the scourging was not to intensify the agony of the divine sufferer,but on the contrary to dispel any malignant influences by which at the supreme moment hemight conceivably be beset.Thus far I have assumed that the human victims at the Thargelia represented the spirits ofvegetation in general, but it has been well remarked by Mr. W. R. Paton that these poorPage 446"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"wretches seem to have masqueraded as the spirits of fig-trees in particular. He points out thatthe process of caprification, as it is called, that is, the artificial fertilisation of the cultivated fig-trees by hanging strings of wild figs among the boughs, takes place in Greece and Asia Minorin June about a month after the date of the Thargelia, and he suggests that the hanging ofthe black and white figs round the necks of the two human victims, one of whom representedthe men and the other the women, may have been a direct imitation of the process of caprifi-cation designed, on the principle of imitative magic, to assist the fertilisation of the fig-trees.And since caprification is in fact a marriage of the male fig-tree with the female fig-tree, Mr.Paton further supposes that the loves of the trees may, on the same principle of imitativemagic, have been simulated by a mock or even a real marriage between the two human vic-tims, one of whom appears sometimes to have been a woman. On this view the practice ofbeating the human victims on their genitals with branches of wild fig-trees and with squillswas a charm intended to stimulate the generative powers of the man and woman who for thetime being personated the male and the female fig-trees respectively, and who by their unionin marriage, whether real or pretended, were believed to help the trees to bear fruit.The interpretation which I have adopted of the custom of beating the human scapegoat withcertain plants is supported by many analogies. Thus among the Kai of German New Guinea,when a man wishes to make his banana shoots bear fruit quickly, he beats them with a stickcut from a banana-tree which has already borne fruit. Here it is obvious that fruitfulness isbelieved to inhere in a stick cut from a fruitful tree and to be imparted by contact to the youngbanana plants. Similarly in New Caledonia a man will beat his taro plants lightly with abranch, saying as he does so, “I beat this taro that it may grow,” after which he plants thebranch in the ground at the end of the field. Among the Indians of Brazil at the mouth of theAmazon, when a man wishes to increase the size of his generative organ, he strikes it withthe fruit of a white aquatic plant called aninga, which grows luxuriantly on the banks of theriver. The fruit, which is inedible, resembles a banana, and is clearly chosen for this purposeon account of its shape. The ceremony should be performed three days before or after thenew moon. In the county of Bekes, in Hungary, barren women are fertilised by being struckwith a stick which has first been used to separate pairing dogs. Here a fertilising virtue isclearly supposed to be inherent in the stick and to be conveyed by contact to the women. TheToradjas of Central Celebes think that the plant Dracaena terminalis has a strong soul,because when it is lopped, it soon grows up again. Hence when a man is ill, his friends willsometimes beat him on the crown of the head with Dracaena leaves in order to strengthenhis weak soul with the strong soul of the plant.These analogies, accordingly, support the interpretation which, following my predecessors W.Mannhardt and Mr. W. R. Paton, I have given of the beating inflicted on the human victims atthe Greek harvest festival of the Thargelia. That beating, being administered to the generativeorgans of the victims by fresh green plants and branches, is most naturally explained as acharm to increase the reproductive energies of the men or women either by communicating tothem the fruitfulness of the plants and branches, or by ridding them of the maleficent influ-ences; and this interpretation is confirmed by the observation that the two victims representedthe two sexes, one of them standing for the men in general and the other for the women. Theseason of the year when the ceremony was performed, namely the time of the corn harvest,tallies well with the theory that the rite had an agricultural significance. Further, that it wasabove all intended to fertilise the fig-trees is strongly suggested by the strings of black andwhite figs which were hung round the necks of the victims, as well as by the blows whichwere given their genital organs with the branches of a wild fig-tree; since this procedureclosely resembles the procedure which ancient and modern husbandmen in Greek landsPage 447"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"have regularly resorted to for the purpose of actually fertilising their fig-trees. When weremember what an important part the artificial fertilisation of the date palm-tree appears tohave played of old not only in the husbandry but in the religion of Mesopotamia, there seemsno reason to doubt that the artificial fertilisation of the fig-tree may in like manner have vindi-cated for itself a place in the solemn ritual of Greek religion.If these considerations are just, we must apparently conclude that while the human victims atthe Thargelia certainly appear in later classical times to have figured chiefly as public scape-goats, who carried away with them the sins, misfortunes, and sorrows of the whole people, atan earlier time they may have been looked on as embodiments of vegetation, perhaps of thecorn but particularly of the fig-trees; and that the beating which they received and the deathwhich they died were intended primarily to brace and refresh the powers of vegetation thenbeginning to droop and languish under the torrid heat of the Greek summer.The view here taken of the Greek scapegoat, if it is correct, obviates an objection which mightotherwise be brought against the main argument of this book. To the theory that the priest ofAricia was slain as a representative of the spirit of the grove, it might have been objected thatsuch a custom has no analogy in classical antiquity. But reasons have now been given forbelieving that the human being periodically and occasionally slain by the Asiatic Greeks wasregularly treated as an embodiment of a divinity of vegetation. Probably the persons whomthe Athenians kept to be sacrificed were similarly treated as divine. That they were social out-casts did not matter. On the primitive view a man is not chosen to be the mouth-piece orembodiment of a god on account of his high moral qualities or social rank. The divine afflatusdescends equally on the good and the bad, the lofty and the lowly. If then the civilised Greeksof Asia and Athens habitually sacrificed men whom they regarded as incarnate gods, therecan be no inherent improbability in the supposition that at the dawn of history a similar cus-tom was observed by the semibarbarous Latins in the Arician Grove.But to clinch the argument, it is clearly desirable to prove that the custom of putting to death ahuman representative of a god was known and practised in ancient Italy elsewhere than inthe Arician Grove. This proof I now propose to adduce.3. THE ROMAN SATURNALIAWe have seen that many peoples have been used to observe an annual period of license,when the customary restraints of law and morality are thrown aside, when the whole popula-tion give themselves up to extravagant mirth and jollity, and when the darker passions find avent which would never be allowed them in the more staid and sober course of ordinary life.Such outbursts of the pent-up forces of human nature, too often degenerating into wild orgiesof lust and crime, occur most commonly at the end of the year, and are frequently associated,as I have had occasion to point out, with one or other of the agricultural seasons, especiallywith the time of sowing or of harvest. Now, of all these periods of license the one which isbest known and which in modern language has given its name to the rest, is the Saturnalia.This famous festival fell in December, the last month of the Roman year, and was popularlysupposed to commemorate the merry reign of Saturn, the god of sowing and of husbandry,who lived on earth long ago as a righteous and beneficent king of Italy, drew the rude andscattered dwellers on the mountains together, taught them to till the ground, gave them laws,and ruled in peace. His reign was the fabled Golden Age: the earth brought forth abundantly:no sound of war or discord troubled the happy world: no baleful love of lucre worked like poi-son in the blood of the industrious and contented peasantry. Slavery and private propertyPage 448"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"were alike unknown: all men had all things in common. At last the good god, the kindly king,vanished suddenly; but his memory was cherished to distant ages, shrines were reared in hishonour, and many hills and high places in Italy bore his name. Yet the bright tradition of hisreign was crossed by a dark shadow: his altars are said to have been stained with the bloodof human victims, for whom a more merciful age afterwards substituted effigies. Of thisgloomy side of the god’s religion there is little or no trace in the descriptions which ancientwriters have left us of the Saturnalia. Feasting and revelry and all the mad pursuit of pleasureare the features that seem to have especially marked this carnival of antiquity, as it went onfor seven days in the streets and public squares and houses of ancient Rome from the sev-enteenth to the twenty-third of December.But no feature of the festival is more remarkable, nothing in it seems to have struck theancients themselves more than the license granted to slaves at this time. The distinctionbetween the free and the servile classes was temporarily abolished. The slave might rail athis master, intoxicate himself like his betters, sit down at table with them, and not even aword of reproof would be administered to him for conduct which at any other season mighthave been punished with stripes, imprisonment, or death. Nay, more, masters actuallychanged places with their slaves and waited on them at table; and not till the serf had doneeating and drinking was the board cleared and dinner set for his master. So far was this inver-sion of ranks carried, that each household became for a time a mimic republic in which thehigh offices of state were discharged by the slaves, who gave their orders and laid down thelaw as if they were indeed invested with all the dignity of the consulship, the praetorship, andthe bench. Like the pale reflection of power thus accorded to bondsmen at the Saturnalia wasthe mock kingship for which freemen cast lots at the same season. The person on whom thelot fell enjoyed the title of king, and issued commands of a playful and ludicrous nature to histemporary subjects. One of them he might order to mix the wine, another to drink, another tosing, another to dance, another to speak in his own dispraise, another to carry a flute-girl onhis back round the house.Now, when we remember that the liberty allowed to slaves at this festive season was sup-posed to be an imitation of the state of society in Saturn’s time, and that in general theSaturnalia passed for nothing more or less than a temporary revival or restoration of the reignof that merry monarch, we are tempted to surmise that the mock king who presided over therevels may have originally represented Saturn himself. The conjecture is strongly confirmed, ifnot established, by a very curious and interesting account of the way in which the Saturnaliawas celebrated by the Roman soldiers stationed on the Danube in the reign of Maximian andDiocletian. The account is preserved in a narrative of the martyrdom of St. Dasius, which wasunearthed from a Greek manuscript in the Paris library, and published by Professor FranzCumont of Ghent. Two briefer descriptions of the event and of the custom are contained inmanuscripts at Milan and Berlin; one of them had already seen the light in an obscure volumeprinted at Urbino in 1727, but its importance for the history of the Roman religion, bothancient and modern, appears to have been overlooked until Professor Cumont drew theattention of scholars to all three narratives by publishing them together some years ago.According to these narratives, which have all the appearance of being authentic, and of whichthe longest is probably based on official documents, the Roman soldiers at Durostorum inLower Moesia celebrated the Saturnalia year by year in the following manner. Thirty daysbefore the festival they chose by lot from amongst themselves a young and handsome man,who was then clothed in royal attire to resemble Saturn. Thus arrayed and attended by a mul-titude of soldiers he went about in public with full license to indulge his passions and to tasteof every pleasure, however base and shameful. But if his reign was merry, it was short andPage 449"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"ended tragically; for when the thirty days were up and the festival of Saturn had come, he cuthis own throat on the altar of the god whom he personated. In the year A.D. 303 the lot fellupon the Christian soldier Dasius, but he refused to play the part of the heathen god and soilhis last days by debauchery. The threats and arguments of his commanding officer Bassusfailed to shake his constancy, and accordingly he was beheaded, as the Christian martyrolo-gist records with minute accuracy, at Durostorum by the soldier John on Friday the twentiethday of November, being the twenty-fourth day of the moon, at the fourth hour.Since this narrative was published by Professor Cumont, its historical character, which hadbeen doubted or denied, has received strong confirmation from an interesting discovery. Inthe crypt of the cathedral which crowns the promontory of Ancona there is preserved, amongother remarkable antiquities, a white marble sarcophagus bearing a Greek inscription, incharacters of the age of Justinian, to the following effect: “Here lies the holy martyr Dasius,brought from Durostorum.” The sarcophagus was transferred to the crypt of the cathedral in1848 from the church of San Pellegrino, under the high altar of which, as we learn from aLatin inscription let into the masonry, the martyr’s bones still repose with those of two othersaints. How long the sarcophagus was deposited in the church of San Pellegrino, we do notknow; but it is recorded to have been there in the year 1650. We may suppose that the saint’srelics were transferred for safety to Ancona at some time in the troubled centuries which fol-lowed his martyrdom, when Moesia was occupied and ravaged by successive hordes of bar-barian invaders. At all events it appears certain from the independent and mutually confirma-tory evidence of the martyrology and the monuments that Dasius was no mythical saint, but areal man, who suffered death for his faith at Durostorum in one of the early centuries of theChristian era. Finding the narrative of the nameless martyrologist thus established as to theprincipal fact recorded, namely, the martyrdom of St. Dasius, we may reasonably accept histestimony as to the manner and cause of the martyrdom, all the more because his narrative isprecise, circumstantial, and entirely free from the miraculous element. Accordingly I concludethat the account which he gives of the celebration of the Saturnalia among the Roman sol-diers is trustworthy.This account sets in a new and lurid light the office of the King of the Saturnalia, the ancientLord of Misrule, who presided over the winter revels at Rome in the time of Horace andTacitus. It seems to prove that his business had not always been that of a mere harlequin ormerry-andrew whose only care was that the revelry should run high and the fun grow fast andfurious, while the fire blazed and crackled on the hearth, while the streets swarmed with fes-tive crowds, and through the clear frosty air, far away to the north, Soracte showed his coro-nal of snow. When we compare this comic monarch of the gay, the civilised metropolis withhis grim counterpart of the rude camp on the Danube, and when we remember the long arrayof similar figures, ludicrous yet tragic, who in other ages and in other lands, wearing mockcrowns and wrapped in sceptred palls, have played their little pranks for a few brief hours ordays, then passed before their time to a violent death, we can hardly doubt that in the King ofthe Saturnalia at Rome, as he is depicted by classical writers, we see only a feeble emascu-lated copy of that original, whose strong features have been fortunately preserved for us bythe obscure author of the Martyrdom of St. Dasius. In other words, the martyrologist’s accountof the Saturnalia agrees so closely with the accounts of similar rites elsewhere which couldnot possibly have been known to him, that the substantial accuracy of his description may beregarded as established; and further, since the custom of putting a mock king to death as arepresentative of a god cannot have grown out of a practice of appointing him to preside overa holiday revel, whereas the reverse may very well have happened, we are justified in assum-ing that in an earlier and more barbarous age it was the universal practice in ancient Italy,Page 450"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"wherever the worship of Saturn prevailed, to choose a man who played the part and enjoyedall the traditionary privileges of Saturn for a season, and then died, whether by his own oranother’s hand, whether by the knife or the fire or on the gallows-tree, in the character of thegood god who gave his life for the world. In Rome itself and other great towns the growth ofcivilisation had probably mitigated this cruel custom long before the Augustan age, and trans-formed it into the innocent shape it wears in the writings of the few classical writers whobestow a passing notice on the holiday King of the Saturnalia. But in remoter districts theolder and sterner practice may long have survived; and even if after the unification of Italy thebarbarous usage was suppressed by the Roman government, the memory of it would behanded down by the peasants and would tend from time to time, as still happens with thelowest forms of superstition among ourselves, to lead to a recrudescence of the practice,especially among the rude soldiery on the outskirts of the empire over whom the once ironhand of Rome was beginning to relax its grasp.The resemblance between the Saturnalia of ancient and the Carnival of modern Italy hasoften been remarked; but in the light of all the facts that have come before us, we may wellask whether the resemblance does not amount to identity. We have seen that in Italy, Spain,and France, that is, in the countries where the influence of Rome has been deepest and mostlasting, a conspicuous feature of the Carnival is a burlesque figure personifying the festiveseason, which after a short career of glory and dissipation is publicly shot, burnt, or otherwisedestroyed, to the feigned grief or genuine delight of the populace. If the view here suggestedof the Carnival is correct, this grotesque personage is no other than a direct successor of theold King of the Saturnalia, the master of the revels, the real man who personated Saturn and,when the revels were over, suffered a real death in his assumed character. The King of theBean on Twelfth Night and the mediaeval Bishop of Fools, Abbot of Unreason, or Lord ofMisrule are figures of the same sort and may perhaps have had a similar origin. Whether thatwas so or not, we may conclude with a fair degree of probability that if the King of the Woodat Aricia lived and died as an incarnation of a sylvan deity, he had of old a parallel at Rome inthe men who, year by year, were slain in the character of King Saturn, the god of the sownand sprouting seed.Chapter LIXKilling the God in MexicoBY no people does the custom of sacrificing the human representative of a god appear tohave been observed so commonly and with so much solemnity as by the Aztecs of ancientMexico. With the ritual of these remarkable sacrifices we are well acquainted, for it has beenfully described by the Spaniards who conquered Mexico in the sixteenth century, and whosecuriosity was naturally excited by the discovery in this distant region of a barbarous and cruelreligion which presented many curious points of analogy to the doctrine and ritual of their ownchurch. “They took a captive,” says the Jesuit Acosta, “such as they thought good; and aforethey did sacrifice him unto their idols, they gave him the name of the idol, to whom he shouldbe sacrificed, and apparelled him with the same ornaments like their idol, saying, that he didrepresent the same idol. And during the time that this representation lasted, which was for ayear in some feasts, in others six months, and in others less, they reverenced and wor-shipped him in the same manner as the proper idol; and in the meantime he did eat, drink,and was merry. When he went through the streets, the people came forth to worship him, andevery one brought him an alms, with children and sick folks, that he might cure them, andbless them, suffering him to do all things at his pleasure, only he was accompanied with tenor twelve men lest he should fly. And he (to the end he might be reverenced as he passed)Page 451"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"sometimes sounded upon a small flute, that the people might prepare to worship him. Thefeast being come, and he grown fat, they killed him, opened him, and ate him, making asolemn sacrifice of him.”This general description of the custom may now be illustrated by particular examples. Thus atthe festival called Toxcatl, the greatest festival of the Mexican year, a young man was annual-ly sacrificed in the character of Tezcatlipoca, “the god of gods,” after having been maintainedand worshipped as that great deity in person for a whole year. According to the oldFranciscan monk Sahagun, our best authority on the Aztec religion, the sacrifice of thehuman god fell at Easter or a few days later, so that, if he is right, it would correspond in dateas well as in character to the Christian festival of the death and resurrection of the Redeemer.More exactly he tells us that the sacrifice took place on the first day of the fifth Aztec month,which according to him began on the twenty-third or twenty-seventh day of April.At this festival the great god died in the person of one human representative and came to lifeagain in the person of another, who was destined to enjoy the fatal honour of divinity for ayear and to perish, like all his predecessors, at the end of it. The young man singled out forthis high dignity was carefully chosen from among the captives on the ground of his personalbeauty. He had to be of unblemished body, slim as a reed and straight as a pillar, neither tootall nor too short. If through high living he grew too fat, he was obliged to reduce himself bydrinking salt water. And in order that he might behave in his lofty station with becoming graceand dignity he was carefully trained to comport himself like a gentleman of the first quality, tospeak correctly and elegantly, to play the flute, to smoke cigars and to snuff at flowers with adandified air. He was honourably lodged in the temple, where the nobles waited on him andpaid him homage, bringing him meat and serving him like a prince. The king himself saw to itthat he was apparelled in gorgeous attire, “for already he esteemed him as a god.” Eagledown was gummed to his head and white cock’s feathers were stuck in his hair, whichdrooped to his girdle. A wreath of flowers like roasted maize crowned his brows, and a gar-land of the same flowers passed over his shoulders and under his armpits. Golden ornamentshung from his nose, golden armlets adorned his arms, golden bells jingled on his legs atevery step he took; earrings of turquoise dangled from his ears, bracelets of turquoisebedecked his wrists; necklaces of shells encircled his neck and depended on his breast; hewore a mantle of network, and round his middle a rich waistcloth. When this bejewelled exqui-site lounged through the streets playing on his flute, puffing at a cigar, and smelling at anosegay, the people whom he met threw themselves on the earth before him and prayed tohim with sighs and tears, taking up the dust in their hands and putting it in their mouths intoken of the deepest humiliation and subjection. Women came forth with children in their armsand presented them to him, saluting him as a god. For “he passed for our Lord God; the peo-ple acknowledged him as the Lord.” All who thus worshipped him on his passage he salutedgravely and courteously. Lest he should flee, he was everywhere attended by a guard of eightpages in the royal livery, four of them with shaven crowns like the palace-slaves, and four ofthem with the flowing locks of warriors; and if he contrived to escape, the captain of the guardhad to take his place as the representative of the god and to die in his stead. Twenty daysbefore he was to die, his costume was changed, and four damsels delicately nurtured andbearing the names of four goddesses—the Goddess of Flowers, the Goddess of the YoungMaize, the Goddess “Our Mother among the Water,” and the Goddess of Salt—were givenhim to be his brides, and with them he consorted. During the last five days divine honourswere showered on the destined victim. The king remained in his palace while the whole courtwent after the human god. Solemn banquets and dances followed each other in regular suc-cession and at appointed places. On the last day the young man, attended by his wives andPage 452"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"pages, embarked in a canoe covered with a royal canopy and was ferried across the lake to aspot where a little hill rose from the edge of the water. It was called the Mountain of Parting,because there his wives bade him a last farewell. Then, accompanied only by his pages, herepaired to a small and lonely temple by the wayside. Like the Mexican temples in general, itwas built in the form of a pyramid; and as the young man ascended the stairs he broke atevery step one of the flutes on which he had played in the days of his glory. On reaching thesummit he was seized and held down by the priests on his back upon a block of stone, whileone of them cut open his breast, thrust his hand into the wound, and wrenching out his heartheld it up in sacrifice to the sun. The body of the dead god was not, like the bodies of com-mon victims, sent rolling down the steps of the temple, but was carried down to the foot,where the head was cut off and spitted on a pike. Such was the regular end of the man whopersonated the greatest god of the Mexican pantheon.The honour of living for a short time in the character of a god and dying a violent death in thesame capacity was not restricted to men in Mexico; women were allowed, or rather com-pelled, to enjoy the glory and to share the doom as representatives of goddesses. Thus at agreat festival in September, which was preceded by a strict fast of seven days, they sanctifieda young slave girl of twelve or thirteen years, the prettiest they could find, to represent theMaize Goddess Chicomecohuatl. They invested her with the ornaments of the goddess, put-ting a mitre on her head and maize-cobs round her neck and in her hands, and fastening agreen feather upright on the crown of her head to imitate an ear of maize. This they did, weare told, in order to signify that the maize was almost ripe at the time of the festival, butbecause it was still tender they chose a girl of tender years to play the part of the MaizeGoddess. The whole long day they led the poor child in all her finery, with the green plumenodding on her head, from house to house dancing merrily to cheer people after the dulnessand privations of the fast.In the evening all the people assembled at the temple, the courts of which they lit up by amultitude of lanterns and candles. There they passed the night without sleeping, and at mid-night, while the trumpets, flutes, and horns discoursed solemn music, a portable framework orpalanquin was brought forth, bedecked with festoons of maize-cobs and peppers and filledwith seeds of all sorts. This the bearers set down at the door of the chamber in which thewooden image of the goddess stood. Now the chamber was adorned and wreathed, both out-side and inside, with wreaths of maize-cobs, peppers, pumpkins, roses, and seeds of everykind, a wonder to behold; the whole floor was covered deep with these verdant offerings ofthe pious. When the music ceased, a solemn procession came forth of priests and dignitaries,with flaring lights and smoking censers, leading in their midst the girl who played the part ofthe goddess. Then they made her mount the framework, where she stood upright on themaize and peppers and pumpkins with which it was strewed, her hands resting on two ban-nisters to keep her from falling. Then the priests swung the smoking censers round her; themusic struck up again, and while it played, a great dignitary of the temple suddenly steppedup to her with a razor in his hand and adroitly shore off the green feather she wore on herhead, together with the hair in which it was fastened, snipping the lock off by the root. Thefeather and the hair he then presented to the wooden image of the goddess with great solem-nity and elaborate ceremonies, weeping and giving her thanks for the fruits of the earth andthe abundant crops which she had bestowed on the people that year; and as he wept andprayed, all the people, standing in the courts of the temple, wept and prayed with him. Whenthat ceremony was over, the girl descended from the framework and was escorted to theplace where she was to spend the rest of the night. But all the people kept watch in thecourts of the temple by the light of torches till break of day.Page 453"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"The morning being come, and the courts of the temple being still crowded by the multitude,who would have deemed it sacrilege to quit the precincts, the priests again brought forth thedamsel attired in the costume of the goddess, with the mitre on her head and the cobs ofmaize about her neck. Again she mounted the portable framework or palanquin and stood onit, supporting herself by her hands on the bannisters. Then the elders of the temple lifted it ontheir shoulders, and while some swung burning censers and others played on instruments orsang, they carried it in procession through the great courtyard to the hall of the godHuitzilopochtli and then back to the chamber, where stood the wooden image of the MaizeGoddess, whom the girl personated. There they caused the damsel to descend from thepalanquin and to stand on the heaps of corn and vegetables that had been spread in profu-sion on the floor of the sacred chamber. While she stood there all the elders and nobles camein a line, one behind the other, carrying saucers full of dry and clotted blood which they haddrawn from their ears by way of penance during the seven days’ fast. One by one they squat-ted on their haunches before her, which was the equivalent of falling on their knees with us,and scraping the crust of blood from the saucer cast it down before her as an offering inreturn for the benefits which she, as the embodiment of the Maize Goddess, had conferredupon them. When the men had thus humbly offered their blood to the human representativeof the goddess, the women, forming a long line, did so likewise, each of them dropping on herhams before the girl and scraping her blood from the saucer. The ceremony lasted a longtime, for great and small, young and old, all without exception had to pass before the incar-nate deity and make their offering. When it was over, the people returned home with gladhearts to feast on flesh and viands of every sort as merrily, we are told, as good Christians atEaster partake of meat and other carnal mercies after the long abstinence of Lent. And whenthey had eaten and drunk their fill and rested after the night watch, they returned quiterefreshed to the temple to see the end of the festival. And the end of the festival was this. Themultitude being assembled, the priests solemnly incensed the girl who personated the god-dess; then they threw her on her back on the heap of corn and seeds, cut off her head,caught the gushing blood in a tub, and sprinkled the blood on the wooden image of the god-dess, the walls of the chamber, and the offerings of corn, peppers, pumpkins, seeds, andvegetables which cumbered the floor. After that they flayed the headless trunk, and one of thepriests made shift to squeeze himself into the bloody skin. Having done so they clad him in allthe robes which the girl had worn; they put the mitre on his head, the necklace of goldenmaize-cobs about his neck, the maize-cobs of feathers and gold in his hands; and thusarrayed they led him forth in public, all of them dancing to the tuck of drum, while he acted asfugleman, skipping and posturing at the head of the procession as briskly as he could beexpected to do, incommoded as he was by the tight and clammy skin of the girl and by herclothes, which must have been much too small for a grown man.In the foregoing custom the identification of the young girl with the Maize Goddess appears tobe complete. The golden maize-cobs which she wore round her neck, the artificial maize-cobs which she carried in her hands, the green feather which was stuck in her hair in imita-tion (we are told) of a green ear of maize, all set her forth as a personification of the corn-spirit; and we are expressly informed that she was specially chosen as a young girl to repre-sent the young maize, which at the time of the festival had not yet fully ripened. Further, heridentification with the corn and the corn-goddess was clearly announced by making her standon the heaps of maize and there receive the homage and blood-offerings of the whole peo-ple, who thereby returned her thanks for the benefits which in her character of a divinity shewas supposed to have conferred upon them. Once more, the practice of beheading her on aheap of corn and seeds and sprinkling her blood, not only on the image of the MaizePage 454"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"Goddess, but on the piles of maize, peppers, pumpkins, seeds, and vegetables, can seem-ingly have had no other object but to quicken and strengthen the crops of corn and the fruitsof the earth in general by infusing into their representatives the blood of the Corn Goddessherself. The analogy of this Mexican sacrifice, the meaning of which appears to be indis-putable, may be allowed to strengthen the interpretation which I have given of other humansacrifices offered for the crops. If the Mexican girl, whose blood was sprinkled on the maize,indeed personated the Maize Goddess, it becomes more than ever probable that the girlwhose blood the Pawnees similarly sprinkled on the seed corn personated in like manner thefemale Spirit of the Corn; and so with the other human beings whom other races haveslaughtered for the sake of promoting the growth of the crops.Lastly, the concluding act of the sacred drama, in which the body of the dead Maize Goddesswas flayed and her skin worn, together with all her sacred insignia, by a man who dancedbefore the people in this grim attire, seems to be best explained on the hypothesis that it wasintended to ensure that the divine death should be immediately followed by the divine resur-rection. If that was so, we may infer with some degree of probability that the practice of killinga human representative of a deity has commonly, perhaps always, been regarded merely asa means of perpetuating the divine energies in the fulness of youthful vigour, untainted by theweakness and frailty of age, from which they must have suffered if the deity had been allowedto die a natural death.These Mexican rites suffice to prove that human sacrifices of the sort I suppose to have pre-vailed at Aricia were, as a matter of fact, regularly offered by a people whose level of culturewas probably not inferior, if indeed it was not distinctly superior, to that occupied by the Italianraces at the early period to which the origin of the Arician priesthood must be referred. Thepositive and indubitable evidence of the prevalence of such sacrifices in one part of the worldmay reasonably be allowed to strengthen the probability of their prevalence in places forwhich the evidence is less full and trustworthy. Taken all together, the facts which we havepassed in review seem to show that the custom of killing men whom their worshippers regardas divine has prevailed in many parts of the world.Chapter LXBetween Heaven and Earth1. NOT TO TOUCH THE EARTHATthe outset of this book two questions were proposed for answer: Why had the priest ofAricia to slay his predecessor? And why, before doing so, had he to pluck the Golden Bough?Of these two questions the first has now been answered. The priest of Aricia, if I am right,was one of those sacred kings or human divinities on whose life the welfare of the communityand even the course of nature in general are believed to be intimately dependent. It does notappear that the subjects or worshippers of such a spiritual potentate form to themselves anyvery clear notion of the exact relationship in which they stand to him; probably their ideas onthe point are vague and fluctuating, and we should err if we attempted to define the relation-ship with logical precision. All that the people know, or rather imagine, is that somehow theythemselves, their cattle, and their crops are mysteriously bound up with their divine king, sothat according as he is well or ill the community is healthy or sickly, the flocks and herdsthrive or languish with disease, and the fields yield an abundant or a scanty harvest. Theworst evil which they can conceive of is the natural death of their ruler, whether he succumbto sickness or old age, for in the opinion of his followers such a death would entail the mostPage 455"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"disastrous consequences on themselves and their possessions; fatal epidemics would sweepaway man and beast, the earth would refuse her increase, nay, the very frame of nature itselfmight be dissolved. To guard against these catastrophes it is necessary to put the king todeath while he is still in the full bloom of his divine manhood, in order that his sacred life,transmitted in unabated force to his successor, may renew its youth, and thus by successivetransmissions through a perpetual line of vigorous incarnations may remain eternally freshand young, a pledge and security that men and animals shall in like manner renew their youthby a perpetual succession of generations, and that seedtime and harvest, and summer andwinter, and rain and sunshine shall never fail. That, if my conjecture is right, was why thepriest of Aricia, the King of the Wood at Nemi, had regularly to perish by the sword of his suc-cessor.But we have still to ask, What was the Golden Bough? and why had each candidate for theArician priesthood to pluck it before he could slay the priest? These questions I will now try toanswer.It will be well to begin by noticing two of those rules or taboos by which, as we have seen, thelife of divine kings or priests is regulated. The first of the rules to which I would call the read-er’s attention is that the divine personage may not touch the ground with his foot. This rulewas observed by the supreme pontiff of the Zapotecs in Mexico; he profaned his sanctity if heso much as touched the ground with his foot. Montezuma, emperor of Mexico, never set footon the ground; he was always carried on the shoulders of noblemen, and if he lighted any-where they laid rich tapestry for him to walk upon. For the Mikado of Japan to touch theground with his foot was a shameful degradation; indeed, in the sixteenth century, it wasenough to deprive him of his office. Outside his palace he was carried on men’s shoulders;within it he walked on exquisitely wrought mats. The king and queen of Tahiti might not touchthe ground anywhere but within their hereditary domains; for the ground on which they trodbecame sacred. In travelling from place to place they were carried on the shoulders of sacredmen. They were always accompanied by several pairs of these sanctified attendants; andwhen it became necessary to change their bearers, the king and queen vaulted on to theshoulders of their new bearers without letting their feet touch the ground. It was an evil omenif the king of Dosuma touched the ground, and he had to perform an expiatory ceremony.Within his palace the king of Persia walked on carpets on which no one else might tread; out-side of it he was never seen on foot but only in a chariot or on horseback. In old days theking of Siam never set foot upon the earth, but was carried on a throne of gold from place toplace. Formerly neither the kings of Uganda, nor their mothers, nor their queens might walkon foot outside of the spacious enclosures in which they lived. Whenever they went forth theywere carried on the shoulders of men of the Buffalo clan, several of whom accompanied anyof these royal personages on a journey and took it in turn to bear the burden. The king satastride the bearer’s neck with a leg over each shoulder and his feet tucked under the bearer’sarms. When one of these royal carriers grew tired he shot the king onto the shoulders of asecond man without allowing the royal feet to touch the ground. In this way they went at agreat pace and travelled long distances in a day, when the king was on a journey. The bear-ers had a special hut in the king’s enclosure in order to be at hand the moment they werewanted. Among the Bakuba, or rather Bushongo, a nation in the southern region of theCongo, down to a few years ago persons of the royal blood were forbidden to touch theground; they must sit on a hide, a chair, or the back of a slave, who crouched on hands andfeet; their feet rested on the feet of others. When they travelled they were carried on thebacks of men; but the king journeyed in a litter supported on shafts. Among the Ibo peopleabout Awka, in Southern Nigeria, the priest of the Earth has to observe many taboos; forPage 456"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"example, he may not see a corpse, and if he meets one on the road he must hide his eyeswith his wristlet. He must abstain from many foods, such as eggs, birds of all sorts, mutton,dog, bush-buck, and so forth. He may neither wear nor touch a mask, and no masked manmay enter his house. If a dog enters his house, it is killed and thrown out. As priest of theEarth he may not sit on the bare ground, nor eat things that have fallen on the ground, normay earth be thrown at him. According to ancient Brahmanic ritual a king at his inaugurationtrod on a tiger’s skin and a golden plate; he was shod with shoes of boar’s skin, and so longas he lived thereafter he might not stand on the earth with his bare feet.But besides persons who are permanently sacred or tabooed and are therefore permanentlyforbidden to touch the ground with their feet, there are others who enjoy the character ofsanctity or taboo only on certain occasions, and to whom accordingly the prohibition in ques-tion only applies at the definite seasons during which they exhale the odour of sanctity. Thusamong the Kayans or Bahaus of Central Borneo, while the priestesses are engaged in theperformance of certain rites they may not step on the ground, and boards are laid for them totread on. Warriors, again, on the war-path are surrounded, so to say, by an atmosphere oftaboo; hence some Indians of North America might not sit on the bare ground the whole timethey were out on a warlike expedition. In Laos the hunting of elephants gives rise to manytaboos; one of them is that the chief hunter may not touch the earth with his foot. Accordingly,when he alights from his elephant, the others spread a carpet of leaves for him to step upon.Apparently holiness, magical virtue, taboo, or whatever we may call that mysterious qualitywhich is supposed to pervade sacred or tabooed persons, is conceived by the primitivephilosopher as a physical substance or fluid, with which the sacred man is charged just as aLeyden jar is charged with electricity; and exactly as the electricity in the jar can be dis-charged by contact with a good conductor, so the holiness or magical virtue in the man canbe discharged and drained away by contact with the earth, which on this theory serves as anexcellent conductor for the magical fluid. Hence in order to preserve the charge from runningto waste, the sacred or tabooed personage must be carefully prevented from touching theground; in electrical language he must be insulated, if he is not to be emptied of the precioussubstance or fluid with which he, as a vial, is filled to the brim. And in many cases apparentlythe insulation of the tabooed person is recommended as a precaution not merely for his ownsake but for the sake of others; for since the virtue of holiness or taboo is, so to say, a power-ful explosive which the smallest touch may detonate, it is necessary in the interest of the gen-eral safety to keep it within narrow bounds, lest breaking out it should blast, blight, anddestroy whatever it comes into contact with.2. NOT TO SEE THE SUNThe second rule to be here noted is that the sun may not shine upon the divine person. Thisrule was observed both by the Mikado and by the pontiff of the Zapotecs. The latter “waslooked upon as a god whom the earth was not worthy to hold, nor the sun to shine upon.”The Japanese would not allow that the Mikado should expose his sacred person to the openair, and the sun was not thought worthy to shine on his head. The Indians of Granada, inSouth America, “kept those who were to be rulers or commanders, whether men or women,locked up for several years when they were children, some of them seven years, and this soclose that they were not to see the sun, for if they should happen to see it they forfeited theirlordship, eating certain sorts of food appointed; and those who were their keepers at certaintimes went into their retreat or prison and scourged them severely.” Thus, for example, theheir to the throne of Bogota, who was not the son but the sister’s son of the king, had toPage 457"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"undergo a rigorous training from his infancy; he lived in complete retirement in a temple,where he might not see the sun nor eat salt nor converse with a woman; he was surroundedby guards who observed his conduct and noted all his actions; if he broke a single one of therules laid down for him, he was deemed infamous and forfeited all his rights to the throne. So,too, the heir to the kingdom of Sogamoso, before succeeding to the crown, had to fast forseven years in the temple, being shut up in the dark and not allowed to see the sun or light.The prince who was to become Inca of Peru had to fast for a month without seeing light.3. THE SECLUSION OF GIRLS AT PUBERTYNow it is remarkable that the foregoing two rules—not to touch the ground and not to see thesun—are observed either separately or conjointly by girls at puberty in many parts of theworld. Thus amongst the negroes of Loango girls at puberty are confined in separate huts,and they may not touch the ground with any part of their bare body. Among the Zulus and kin-dred tribes of South Africa, when the first signs of puberty show themselves “while a girl iswalking, gathering wood, or working in the field, she runs to the river and hides herself amongthe reeds for the day, so as not to be seen by men. She covers her head carefully with herblanket that the sun may not shine on it and shrivel her up into a withered skeleton, as wouldresult from exposure to the sun’s beams. After dark she returns to her home and is secluded”in a hut for some time. With the Awa-nkonde, a tribe at the northern end of Lake Nyassa, it isa rule that after her first menstruation a girl must be kept apart, with a few companions of herown sex, in a darkened house. The floor is covered with dry banana leaves, but no fire maybe lit in the house, which is called “the house of the Awasungu,” that is, “of maidens whohave no hearts.”In New Ireland girls are confined for four or five years in small cages, being kept in the darkand not allowed to set foot on the ground. The custom has been thus described by an eye-witness. “I heard from a teacher about some strange custom connected with some of theyoung girls here, so I asked the chief to take me to the house where they were. The housewas about twenty-five feet in length, and stood in a reed and bamboo enclosure, across theentrance to which a bundle of dried grass was suspended to show that it was strictly ‘tabu.’Inside the house were three conical structures about seven or eight feet in height, and aboutten or twelve feet in circumference at the bottom, and for about four feet from the ground, atwhich point they tapered off to a point at the top. These cages were made of the broad leavesof the pandanus-tree, sewn quite close together so that no light and little or no air could enter.On one side of each is an opening which is closed by a double door of plaited cocoa-nut treeand pandanus-tree leaves. About three feet from the ground there is a stage of bambooswhich forms the floor. In each of these cages we were told there was a young woman con-fined, each of whom had to remain for at least four or five years, without ever being allowedto go outside the house. I could scarcely credit the story when I heard it; the whole thingseemed too horrible to be true. I spoke to the chief, and told him that I wished to see theinside of the cages, and also to see the girls that I might make them a present of a fewbeads. He told me that it was ‘tabu,’ forbidden for any men but their own relations to look atthem; but I suppose the promised beads acted as an inducement, and so he sent away forsome old lady who had charge, and who alone is allowed to open the doors. While we werewaiting we could hear the girls talking to the chief in a querulous way as if objecting to some-thing or expressing their fears. The old woman came at length and certainly she did not seema very pleasant jailor or guardian; nor did she seem to favour the request of the chief to allowus to see the girls, as she regarded us with anything but pleasant looks. However, she had toundo the door when the chief told her to do so, and then the girls peeped out at us, and,Page 458"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"when told to do so, they held out their hands for the beads. I, however, purposely sat at somedistance away and merely held out the beads to them, as I wished to draw them quite out-side, that I might inspect the inside of the cages. This desire of mine gave rise to another diffi-culty, as these girls were not allowed to put their feet to the ground all the time they were con-fined in these places. However, they wished to get the beads, and so the old lady had to gooutside and collect a lot of pieces of wood and bamboo, which she placed on the ground, andthen going to one of the girls, she helped her down and held her hand as she stepped fromone piece of wood to another until she came near enough to get the beads I held out to her. Ithen went to inspect the inside of the cage out of which she had come, but could scarely putmy head inside of it, the atmosphere was so hot and stifling. It was clean and contained noth-ing but a few short lengths of bamboo for holding water. There was only room for the girl to sitor lie down in a crouched position on the bamboo platform, and when the doors are shut itmust be nearly or quite dark inside. The girls are never allowed to come out except once aday to bathe in a dish or wooden bowl placed close to each cage. They say that they perspireprofusely. They are placed in these stifling cages when quite young, and must remain thereuntil they are young women, when they are taken out and have each a great marriage feastprovided for them. One of them was about fourteen or fifteen years old, and the chief told usthat she had been there for five years, but would soon be taken out now. The other two wereabout eight and ten years old, and they have to stay there for several years longer.”In Kabadi, a district of British New Guinea, “daughters of chiefs, when they are about twelveor thirteen years of age, are kept indoors for two or three years, never being allowed, underany pretence, to descend from the house, and the house is so shaded that the sun cannotshine on them.” Among the Yabim and Bukaua, two neighbouring and kindred tribes on thecoast of Northern New Guinea, a girl at puberty is secluded for some five or six weeks in aninner part of the house; but she may not sit on the floor, lest her uncleanliness should cleaveto it, so a log of wood is placed for her to squat on. Moreover, she may not touch the groundwith her feet; hence if she is obliged to quit the house for a short time, she is muffled up inmats and walks on two halves of a coco-nut shell, which are fastened like sandals to her feetby creeping plants. Among the Ot Danoms of Borneo girls at the age of eight or ten years areshut up in a little room or cell of the house, and cut off from all intercourse with the world for along time. The cell, like the rest of the house, is raised on piles above the ground, and is lit bya single small window opening on a lonely place, so that the girl is in almost total darkness.She may not leave the room on any pretext whatever, not even for the most necessary pur-poses. None of her family may see her all the time she is shut up, but a single slave womanis appointed to wait on her. During her lonely confinement, which often lasts seven years, thegirl occupies herself in weaving mats or with other handiwork. Her bodily growth is stunted bythe long want of exercise, and when, on attaining womanhood, she is brought out, her com-plexion is pale and wax-like. She is now shown the sun, the earth, the water, the trees, andthe flowers, as if she were newly born. Then a great feast is made, a slave is killed, and thegirl is smeared with his blood. In Ceram girls at puberty were formerly shut up by themselvesin a hut which was kept dark. In Yap, one of the Caroline Islands, should a girl be overtakenby her first menstruation on the public road, she may not sit down on the earth, but must begfor a coco-nut shell to put under her. She is shut up for several days in a small hut at a dis-tance from her parents’ house, and afterwards she is bound to sleep for a hundred days inone of the special houses which are provided for the use of menstruous women.In the island of Mabuiag, Torres Straits, when the signs of puberty appear on a girl, a circle ofbushes is made in a dark corner of the house. Here, decked with shoulder-belts, armlets,leglets just below the knees, and anklets, wearing a chaplet on her head, and shell orna-Page 459"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"ments in her ears, on her chest, and on her back, she squats in the midst of the bushes,which are piled so high round about her that only her head is visible. In this state of seclusionshe must remain for three months. All this time the sun may not shine upon her, but at nightshe is allowed to slip out of the hut, and the bushes that hedge her in are then changed. Shemay not feed herself or handle food, but is fed by one or two old women, her maternal aunts,who are especially appointed to look after her. One of these women cooks food for her at aspecial fire in the forest. The girl is forbidden to eat turtle or turtle eggs during the seasonwhen the turtles are breeding; but no vegetable food is refused her. No man, not even herown father, may come into the house while her seclusion lasts; for if her father saw her at thistime he would certainly have bad luck in his fishing, and would probably smash his canoe thevery next time he went out in it. At the end of the three months she is carried down to a fresh-water creek by her attendants, hanging on to their shoulders in such a way that her feet donot touch the ground, while the women of the tribe form a ring round her, and thus escort herto the beach. Arrived at the shore, she is stripped of her ornaments, and the bearers staggerwith her into the creek, where they immerse her, and all the other women join in splashingwater over both the girl and her bearers. When they come out of the water one of the twoattendants makes a heap of grass for her charge to squat upon. The other runs to the reef,catches a small crab, tears off its claws, and hastens back with them to the creek. Here in themeantime a fire has been kindled, and the claws are roasted at it. The girl is then fed by herattendants with the roasted claws. After that she is freshly decorated, and the whole partymarches back to the village in a single rank, the girl walking in the centre between her two oldaunts, who hold her by the wrists. The husbands of her aunts now receive her and lead herinto the house of one of them, where all partake of food, and the girl is allowed once more tofeed herself in the usual manner. A dance follows, in which the girl takes a prominent part,dancing between the husbands of the two aunts who had charge of her in her retirement.Among the Yaraikanna tribe of Cape York Peninsula, in Northern Queensland, a girl at puber-ty is said to live by herself for a month or six weeks; no man may see her, though any womanmay. She stays in a hut or shelter specially made for her, on the floor of which she liessupine. She may not see the sun, and towards sunset she must keep her eyes shut until thesun has gone down, otherwise it is thought that her nose will be diseased. During her seclu-sion she may eat nothing that lives in salt water, or a snake would kill her. An old womanwaits upon her and supplies her with roots, yams, and water. Some Australian tribes are wontto bury their girls at such seasons more or less deeply in the ground, perhaps in order to hidethem from the light of the sun.Among the Indians of California a girl at her first menstruation “was thought to be possessedof a particular degree of supernatural power, and this was not always regarded as entirelydefiling or malevolent. Often, however, there was a strong feeling of the power of evil inherentin her condition. Not only was she secluded from her family and the community, but anattempt was made to seclude the world from her. One of the injunctions most strongly laidupon her was not to look about her. She kept her head bowed and was forbidden to see theworld and the sun. Some tribes covered her with a blanket. Many of the customs in this con-nection resembled those of the North Pacific Coast most strongly, such as the prohibition tothe girl to touch or scratch her head with her hand, a special implement being furnished herfor the purpose. Sometimes she could eat only when fed and in other cases fasted altogeth-er.”Among the Chinook Indians who inhabited the coast of Washington State, when a chief’sdaughter attained to puberty, she was hidden for five days from the view of the people; shePage 460"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"might not look at them nor at the sky, nor might she pick berries. It was believed that if shewere to look at the sky, the weather would be bad; that if she picked berries, it would rain;and that when she hung her towel of cedar-bark on a spruce-tree, the tree withered up atonce. She went out of the house by a separate door and bathed in a creek far from the vil-lage. She fasted for some days, and formany days more she might not eat fresh food.Amongst the Aht or Nootka Indians of Vancouver Island, when girls reach puberty they areplaced in a sort of gallery in the house “and are there surrounded completely with mats, sothat neither the sun nor any fire can be seen. In this cage they remain for several days. Wateris given them, but no food. The longer a girl remains in this retirement the greater honour is itto the parents; but she is disgraced for life if it is known that she has seen fire or the sun dur-ing this initiatory ordeal.” Pictures of the mythical thunder-bird are painted on the screensbehind which she hides. During her seclusion she may neither move nor lie down, but mustalways sit in a squatting posture. She may not touch her hair with her hands, but is allowed toscratch her head with a comb or a piece of bone provided for the purpose. To scratch herbody is also forbidden, as it is believed that every scratch would leave a scar. For eightmonths after reaching maturity she may not eat any fresh food, particularly salmon; moreover,she must eat by herself, and use a cup and dish of her own.In the Tsetsaut tribe of British Columbia a girl at puberty wears a large hat of skin whichcomes down over her face and screens it from the sun. It is believed that if she were toexpose her face to the sun or to the sky, rain would fall. The hat protects her face alsoagainst the fire, which ought not to strike her skin; to shield her hands she wears mittens. Inher mouth she carries the tooth of an animal to prevent her own teeth from becoming hollow.For a whole year she may not see blood unless her face is blackened; otherwise she wouldgrow blind. For two years she wears the hat and lives in a hut by herself, although she isallowed to see other people. At the end of two years a man takes the hat from her head andthrows it away. In the Bilqula or Bella Coola tribe of British Columbia, when a girl attainspuberty she must stay in the shed which serves as her bedroom, where she has a separatefireplace. She is not allowed to descend to the main part of the house, and may not sit by thefire of the family. For four days she is bound to remain motionless in a sitting posture. Shefasts during the day, but is allowed a little food and drink very early in the morning. After thefour days’ seclusion she may leave her room, but only through a separate opening cut in thefloor, for the houses are raised on piles. She may not yet come into the chief room. In leavingthe house she wears a large hat which protects her face against the rays of the sun. It isbelieved that if the sun were to shine on her face her eyes would suffer. She may pick berrieson the hills, but may not come near the river or sea for a whole year. Were she to eat freshsalmon she would lose her senses, or her mouth would be changed into a long beak.Amongst the Tlingit (Thlinkeet) or Kolosh Indians of Alaska, when a girl showed signs ofwomanhood she used to be confined to a little hut or cage, which was completely blocked upwith the exception of a small air-hole. In this dark and filthy abode she had to remain a year,without fire, exercise, or associates. Only her mother and a female slave might supply herwith nourishment. Her food was put in at the little window; she had to drink out of the wing-bone of a white-headed eagle. The time of her seclusion was afterwards reduced in someplaces to six or three months or even less. She had to wear a sort of hat with long flaps, thather gaze might not pollute the sky; for she was thought unfit for the sun to shine upon, and itwas imagined that her look would destroy the luck of a hunter, fisher, or gambler, turn thingsto stone, and do other mischief. At the end of her confinement her old clothes were burnt,Page 461"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"new ones were made, and a feast was given, at which a slit was cut in her under lip parallelto the mouth, and a piece of wood or shell was inserted to keep the aperture open. Amongthe Koniags, an Esquimau people of Alaska, a girl at puberty was placed in a small hut inwhich she had to remain on her hands and feet for six months; then the hut was enlarged alittle so as to allow her to straighten her back, but in this posture she had to remain for sixmonths more. All this time she was regarded as an unclean being with whom no one mighthold intercourse.When symptoms of puberty appeared on a girl for the first time, the Guaranis of SouthernBrazil, on the borders of Paraguay, used to sew her up in her hammock, leaving only a smallopening in it to allow her to breathe. In this condition, wrapt up and shrouded like a corpse,she was kept for two or three days or so long as the symptoms lasted, and during this timeshe had to observe a most rigorous fast. After that she was entrusted to a matron, who cutthe girl’s hair and enjoined her to abstain most strictly from eating flesh of any kind until herhair should be grown long enough to hide her ears. In similar circumstances the Chiriguanosof South-eastern Bolivia hoisted the girl in her hammock to the roof, where she stayed for amonth: the second month the hammock was let half-way down from the roof; and in the thirdmonth old women, armed with sticks, entered the hut and ran about striking everything theymet, saying they were hunting the snake that had wounded the girl.Among the Matacos or Mataguayos, an Indian tribe of the Gran Chaco, a girl at puberty hasto remain in seclusion for some time. She lies covered up with branches or other things in acorner of the hut, seeing no one and speaking to no one, and during this time she may eatneither flesh nor fish. Meantime a man beats a drum in front of the house. Among theYuracares, an Indian tribe of Eastern Bolivia, when a girl perceives the signs of puberty, herfather constructs a little hut of palm leaves near the house. In this cabin he shuts up hisdaughter so that she cannot see the light, and there she remains fasting rigorously for fourdays.Amongst the Macusis of British Guiana, when a girl shows the first signs of puberty, she ishung in a hammock at the highest point of the hut. For the first few days she may not leavethe hammock by day, but at night she must come down, light a fire, and spend the nightbeside it, else she would break out in sores on her neck, throat, and other parts of her body.So long as the symptoms are at their height, she must fast rigorously. When they have abat-ed, she may come down and take up her abode in a little compartment that is made for her inthe darkest corner of the hut. In the morning she may cook her food, but it must be at a sepa-rate fire and in a vessel of her own. After about ten days the magician comes and undoes thespell by muttering charms and breathing on her and on the more valuable of the things withwhich she has come in contact. The pots and drinking-vessels which she used are brokenand the fragments buried. After her first bath, the girl must submit to be beaten by her motherwith thin rods without uttering a cry. At the end of the second period she is again beaten, butnot afterwards. She is now “clean,” and can mix again with people. Other Indians of Guiana,after keeping the girl in her hammock at the top of the hut for a month, expose her to certainlarge ants, whose bite is very painful. Sometimes, in addition to being stung with ants, thesufferer has to fast day and night so long as she remains slung up on high in her hammock,so that when she comes down she is reduced to a skeleton.When a Hindoo maiden reaches maturity she is kept in a dark room for four days, and is for-bidden to see the sun. She is regarded as unclean; no one may touch her. Her diet is restrict-ed to boiled rice, milk, sugar, curd, and tamarind without salt. On the morning of the fifth dayPage 462"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"she goes to a neighbouring tank, accompanied by five women whose husbands are alive.Smeared with turmeric water, they all bathe and return home, throwing away the mat andother things that were in the room. The Rarhi Brahmans of Bengal compel a girl at puberty tolive alone, and do not allow her to see the face of any male. For three days she remains shutup in a dark room, and has to undergo certain penances. Fish, flesh, and sweetmeats are for-bidden her; she must live upon rice and ghee. Among the Tiyans of Malabar a girl is thoughtto be polluted for four days from the beginning of her first menstruation. During this time shemust keep to the north side of the house, where she sleeps on a grass mat of a particularkind, in a room festooned with garlands of young coco-nut leaves. Another girl keeps hercompany and sleeps with her, but she may not touch any other person, tree or plant. Further,she may not see the sky, and woe betide her if she catches sight of a crow or a cat! Her dietmust be strictly vegetarian, without salt, tamarinds, or chillies. She is armed against evil spir-its by a knife, which is placed on the mat or carried on her person.In Cambodia a girl at puberty is put to bed under a mosquito curtain, where she should stay ahundred days. Usually, however, four, five, ten, or twenty days are thought enough; and eventhis, in a hot climate and under the close meshes of the curtain, is sufficiently trying.According to another account, a Cambodian maiden at puberty is said to “enter into theshade.” During her retirement, which, according to the rank and position of her family, maylast any time from a few days to several years, she has to observe a number of rules, suchas not to be seen by a strange man, not to eat flesh or fish, and so on. She goes nowhere,not even to the pagoda. But this state of seclusion is discontinued during eclipses; at suchtimes she goes forth and pays her devotions to the monster who is supposed to causeeclipses by catching the heavenly bodies between his teeth. This permission to break her ruleof retirement and appear abroad during an eclipse seems to show how literally the injunctionis interpreted which forbids maidens entering on womanhood to look upon the sun.Asuperstition so widely diffused as this might be expected to leave traces in legends andfolk-tales. And it has done so. The old Greek story of Danae, who was confined by her fatherin a subterranean chamber or a brazen tower, but impregnated by Zeus, who reached her inthe shape of a shower of gold, perhaps belongs to this class of tales. It has its counterpart inthe legend which the Kirghiz of Siberia tell of their ancestry. A certain Khan had a fair daugh-ter, whom he kept in a dark iron house, that no man might see her. An old woman tended her;and when the girl was grown to maidenhood she asked the old woman, “Where do you go sooften?” “My child,” said the old dame, “there is a bright world. In that bright world your fatherand mother live, and all sorts of people live there. That is where I go.” The maiden said,“Good mother, I will tell nobody, but show me that bright world.” So the old woman took thegirl out of the iron house. But when she saw the bright world, the girl tottered and fainted; andthe eye of God fell upon her, and she conceived. Her angry father put her in a golden chestand sent her floating away (fairy gold can float in fairyland) over the wide sea. The shower ofgold in the Greek story, and the eye of God in the Kirghiz legend, probably stand for sunlightand the sun. The idea that women may be impregnated by the sun is not uncommon in leg-ends, and there are even traces of it in marriage customs.4. REASONS FOR THE SECLUSION OF GIRLS AT PUBERYThe motive for the restraints so commonly imposed on girls at puberty is the deeplyengrained dread which primitive man universally entertains of menstruous blood. He fears itat all times but especially on its first appearance; hence the restrictions under which womenlie at their first menstruation are usually more stringent than those which they have to observePage 463"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"at any subsequent recurrence of the mysterious flow. Some evidence of the fear and of thecustoms based on it has been cited in an earlier part of this work; but as the terror, for it isnothing less, which the phenomenon periodically strikes into the mind of the savage hasdeeply influenced his life and institutions, it may be well to illustrate the subject with some fur-ther examples.Thus in the Encounter Bay tribe of South Australia there is, or used to be, a “superstitionwhich obliges a woman to separate herself from the camp at the time of her monthly illness,when if a young man or boy should approach, she calls out, and he immediately makes a cir-cuit to avoid her. If she is neglectful upon this point, she exposes herself to scolding, andsometimes to severe beating by her husband or nearest relation, because the boys are toldfrom their infancy, that if they see the blood they will early become grey-headed, and theirstrength will fail prematurely.” The Dieri of Central Australia believe that if women at thesetimes were to eat fish or bathe in a river, the fish would all die and the water would dry up.The Arunta of the same region forbid menstruous women to gather the irriakura bulbs, whichform a staple article of diet for both men and women. They think that were a woman to breakthis rule, the supply of bulbs would fail.In some Australian tribes the seclusion of menstruous women was even more rigid, and wasenforced by severer penalties than a scolding or a beating. Thus “there is a regulation relatingto camps in the Wakelbura tribe which forbids the women coming into the encampment by thesame path as the men. Any violation of this rule would in a large camp be punished withdeath. The reason for this is the dread with which they regard the menstrual period of women.During such a time, a woman is kept entirely away from the camp, half a mile at least. Awoman in such a condition has boughs of some tree of her totem tied round her loins, and isconstantly watched and guarded, for it is thought that should any male be so unfortunate asto see a woman in such a condition, he would die. If such a woman were to let herself beseen by a man, she would probably be put to death. When the woman has recovered, she ispainted red and white, her head covered with feathers, and returns to the camp.”In Muralug, one of the Torres Straits Islands, a menstruous woman may not eat anything thatlives in the sea, else the natives believe that the fisheries would fail. In Galela, to the west ofNew Guinea, women at their monthly periods may not enter a tobacco-field, or the plantswould be attacked by disease. The Minangkabauers of Sumatra are persuaded that if awoman in her unclean state were to go near a rice-field, the crop would be spoiled.The Bushmen of South Africa think that, by a glance of a girl’s eye at the time when sheought to be kept in strict retirement, men become fixed in whatever positions they happen tooccupy, with whatever they were holding in their hands, and are changed into trees that talk.Cattle-rearing tribes of South Africa hold that their cattle would die if the milk were drunk by amenstruous woman; and they fear the same disaster if a drop of her blood were to fall on theground and the oxen were to pass over it. To prevent such a calamity women in general, notmenstruous women only, are forbidden to enter the cattle enclosure; and more than that, theymay not use the ordinary paths in entering the village or in passing from one hut to another.They are obliged to make circuitous tracks at the back of the huts in order to avoid theground in the middle of the village where the cattle stand or lie down. These women’s tracksmay be seen at every Caffre village. Among the Baganda, in like manner, no menstruouswoman might drink milk or come into contact with any milk-vessel; and she might not touchanything that belonged to her husband, nor sit on his mat, nor cook his food. If she touchedanything of his at such a time it was deemed equivalent to wishing him dead or to actuallyPage 464"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"working magic for his destruction. Were she to handle any article of his, he would surely fallill; were she to touch his weapons, he would certainly be killed in the next battle. Further, theBaganda would not suffer a menstruous woman to visit a well; if she did so, they feared thatthe water would dry up, and that she herself would fall sick and die, unless she confessed herfault and the medicine-man made atonement for her. Among the Akikuyu of British EastAfrica, if a new hut is built in a village and the wife chances to menstruate in it on the day shelights the first fire there, the hut must be broken down and demolished the very next day. Thewoman may on no account sleep a second night in it; there is a curse both on her and on it.According to the Talmud, if a woman at the beginning of her period passes between two men,she thereby kills one of them. Peasants of the Lebanon think that menstruous women are thecause or many misfortunes; their shadow causes flowers to wither and trees to perish, it evenarrests the movements of serpents; if one of them mounts a horse, the animal might die or atleast be disabled for a long time.The Guayquiries of the Orinoco believe that when a woman has her courses, everything uponwhich she steps will die, and that if a man treads on the place where she has passed, hislegs will immediately swell up. Among the Bri-bri Indians of Costa Rica a married woman ather periods uses for plates only banana leaves, which, when she has done with them, shethrows away in a sequestered spot; for should a cow find and eat them, the animal wouldwaste away and perish. Also she drinks only out of a special vessel, because any person whoshould afterwards drink out of the same vessel would infallibly pine away and die.Among most tribes of North American Indians the custom was that women in their coursesretired from the camp or the village and lived during the time of their uncleanness in specialhuts or shelters which were appropriated to their use. There they dwelt apart, eating andsleeping by themselves, warming themselves at their own fires, and strictly abstaining from allcommunications with men, who shunned them just as if they were stricken with the plague.Thus, to take examples, the Creek and kindred Indians of the United States compelledwomen at menstruation to live in separate huts at some distance from the village. There thewomen had to stay, at the risk of being surprised and cut off by enemies. It was thought “amost horrid and dangerous pollution” to go near the women at such times; and the dangerextended to enemies who, if they slew the women, had to cleanse themselves from the pollu-tion by means of certain sacred herbs and roots. The Stseelis Indians of British Columbiaimagined that if a menstruous woman were to step over a bundle of arrows, the arrows wouldthereby be rendered useless and might even cause the death of their owner; and similarlythat if she passed in front of a hunter who carried a gun, the weapon would never shootstraight again. Among the Chippeways and other Indians of the Hudson Bay Territory, men-struous women are excluded from the camp, and take up their abode in huts of branches.They wear long hoods, which effectually conceal the head and breast. They may not touchthe household furniture nor any objects used by men; for their touch “is supposed to defilethem, so that their subsequent use would be followed by certain mischief or misfortune,” suchas disease or death. They must drink out of a swan’s bone. They may not walk on the com-mon paths nor cross the tracks of animals. They “are never permitted to walk on the ice ofrivers or lakes, or near the part where the men are hunting beaver, or where a fishing-net isset, for fear of averting their success. They are also prohibited at those times from partakingof the head of any animal, and even from walking in or crossing the track where the head of adeer, moose, beaver, and many other animals have lately been carried, either on a sledge oron the back. To be guilty of a violation of this custom is considered as of the greatest impor-Page 465"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"tance; because they firmly believe that it would be a means of preventing the hunter fromhaving an equal success in his future excursions.” So the Lapps forbid women at menstrua-tion to walk on that part of the shore where the fishers are in the habit of setting out their fish;and the Esquimaux of Bering Strait believe that if hunters were to come near women in theircourses they would catch no game. For a like reason the Carrier Indians will not suffer amenstruous woman to cross the tracks of animals; if need be, she is carried over them. Theythink that if she waded in a stream or a lake, the fish would die.Amongst the civilised nations of Europe the superstitions which cluster round this mysteriousaspect of woman’s nature are not less extravagant than those which prevail among savages.In the oldest existing cyclopaedia—the Natural History of Pliny—the list of dangers appre-hended from menstruation is longer than any furnished by mere barbarians. According toPliny, the touch of a menstruous woman turned wine to vinegar, blighted crops, killedseedlings, blasted gardens, brought down the fruit from trees, dimmed mirrors, bluntedrazors, rusted iron and brass (especially at the waning of the moon), killed bees, or at leastdrove them from their hives, caused mares to miscarry, and so forth. Similarly, in variousparts of Europe, it is still believed that if a woman in her courses enters a brewery the beerwill turn sour; if she touches beer, wine, vinegar, or milk, it will go bad; if she makes jam, itwill not keep; if she mounts a mare, it will miscarry; if she touches buds, they will wither; ifshe climbs a cherry tree, it will die. In Brunswick people think that if a menstruous womanassists at the killing of a pig, the pork will putrefy. In the Greek island of Calymnos a womanat such times may not go to the well to draw water, nor cross a running stream, nor enter thesea. Her presence in a boat is said to raise storms.Thus the object of secluding women at menstruation is to neutralise the dangerous influenceswhich are supposed to emanate from them at such times. That the danger is believed to beespecially great at the first menstruation appears from the unusual precautions taken to iso-late girls at this crisis. Two of these precautions have been illustrated above, namely, therules that the girls may not touch the ground nor see the sun. The general effect of theserules is to keep her suspended, so to say, between heaven and earth. Whether enveloped inher hammock and slung up to the roof, as in South America, or raised above the ground in adark and narrow cage, as in New Ireland, she may be considered to be out of the way ofdoing mischief, since, being shut off both from the earth and from the sun, she can poisonneither of these great sources of life by her deadly contagion. In short, she is rendered harm-less by being, in electrical language, insulated. But the precautions thus taken to isolate orinsulate the girl are dictated by a regard for her own safety as well as for the safety of others.For it is thought that she herself would suffer if she were to neglect the prescribed regimen.Thus Zulu girls, as we have seen, believe that they would shrivel to skeletons if the sun wereto shine on them at puberty, and the Macusis imagine that, if a young woman were to trans-gress the rules, she would suffer from sores on various parts of her body. In short, the girl isviewed as charged with a powerful force which, if not kept within bounds, may prove destruc-tive both to herself and to all with whom she comes in contact. To repress this force within thelimits necessary for the safety of all concerned is the object of the taboos in question.The same explanation applies to the observance of the same rules by divine kings andpriests. The uncleanness, as it is called, of girls at puberty and the sanctity of holy men donot, to the primitive mind, differ materially from each other. They are only different manifesta-tions of the same mysterious energy which, like energy in general, is in itself neither good norbad, but becomes beneficent or maleficent according to its application. Accordingly, if, likegirls at puberty, divine personages may neither touch the ground nor see the sun, the reasonPage 466"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"is, on the one hand, a fear lest their divinity might, at contact with earth or heaven, dischargeitself with fatal violence on either; and, on the other hand, an apprehension that the divinebeing, thus drained of his ethereal virtue, might thereby be incapacitated for the future per-formance of those magical functions, upon the proper discharge of which the safety of thepeople and even of the world is believed to hang. Thus the rules in question fall under thehead of the taboos which we examined in an earlier part of this book; they are intended topreserve the life of the divine person and with it the life of his subjects and worshippers.Nowhere, it is thought, can his precious yet dangerous life be at once so safe and so harm-less as when it is neither in heaven nor in earth, but, as far as possible, suspended betweenthe two.Chapter LXIThe Myth of BalderADEITY whose life might in a sense be said to be neither in heaven nor on earth butbetween the two, was the Norse Balder, the good and beautiful god, the son of the great godOdin, and himself the wisest, mildest, best beloved of all the immortals. The story of hisdeath, as it is told in the younger or prose Edda, runs thus. Once on a time Balder dreamedheavy dreams which seemed to forebode his death. Thereupon the gods held a council andresolved to make him secure against every danger. So the goddess Frigg took an oath fromfire and water, iron and all metals, stones and earth, from trees, sicknesses and poisons, andfrom all four-footed beasts, birds, and creeping things, that they would not hurt Balder. Whenthis was done Balder was deemed invulnerable; so the gods amused themselves by settinghim in their midst, while some shot at him, others hewed at him, and others threw stones athim. But whatever they did, nothing could hurt him; and at this they were all glad. Only Loki,the mischief-maker, was displeased, and he went in the guise of an old woman to Frigg, whotold him that the weapons of the gods could not wound Balder, since she had made them allswear not to hurt him. Then Loki asked, “Have all things sworn to spare Balder?” Sheanswered, “East of Walhalla grows a plant called mistletoe; it seemed to me too young toswear.” So Loki went and pulled the mistletoe and took it to the assembly of the gods. Therehe found the blind god Hother standing at the outside of the circle. Loki asked him, “Why doyou not shoot at Balder?” Hother answered, “Because I do not see where he stands; besidesI have no weapon.” Then said Loki, “Do like the rest and show Balder honour, as they all do. Iwill show you where he stands, and do you shoot at him with this twig.” Hother took themistletoe and threw it at Balder, as Loki directed him. The mistletoe struck Balder and piercedhim through and through, and he fell down dead. And that was the greatest misfortune thatever befell gods and men. For a while the gods stood speechless, then they lifted up theirvoices and wept bitterly. They took Balder’s body and brought it to the sea-shore. There stoodBalder’s ship; it was called Ringhorn, and was the hugest of all ships. The gods wished tolaunch the ship and to burn Balder’s body on it, but the ship would not stir. So they sent for agiantess called Hyrrockin. She came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fireflashed from the rollers and all the earth shook. Then Balder’s body was taken and placed onthe funeral pile upon his ship. When his wife Nanna saw that, her heart burst for sorrow andshe died. So she was laid on the funeral pile with her husband, and fire was put to it. Balder’shorse, too, with all its trappings, was burned on the pile.Whether he was a real or merely a mythical personage, Balder was worshipped in Norway.On one of the bays of the beautiful Sogne Fiord, which penetrates far into the depths of thesolemn Norwegian mountains, with their sombre pine-forests and their lofty cascades dissolv-ing into spray before they reach the dark water of the fiord far below, Balder had a greatPage 467"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"sanctuary. It was called Balder’s Grove. A palisade enclosed the hallowed ground, and withinit stood a spacious temple with the images of many gods, but none of them was worshippedwith such devotion as Balder. So great was the awe with which the heathen regarded theplace that no man might harm another there, nor steal his cattle, nor defile himself withwomen. But women cared for the images of the gods in the temple; they warmed them at thefire, anointed them with oil, and dried them with cloths.Whatever may be thought of an historical kernel underlying a mythical husk in the legend ofBalder, the details of the story suggest that it belongs to that class of myths which have beendramatised an ritual, or, to put it otherwise, which have been performed as magical cere-monies for the sake of producing those natural effects which they describe in figurative lan-guage. A myth is never so graphic and precise in its details as when it is, so to speak, thebook of the words which are spoken and acted by the performers of the sacred rite. That theNorse story of Balder was a myth of this sort will become probable if we can prove that cere-monies resembling the incidents in the tale have been performed by Norsemen and otherEuropean peoples. Now the main incidents in the tale are two—first, the pulling of the mistle-toe, and second, the death and burning of the god; and both of them may perhaps be foundto have had their counterparts in yearly rites observed, whether separately or conjointly, bypeople in various parts of Europe. These rites will be described and discussed in the followingchapters. We shall begin with the annual festivals of fire and shall reserve the pulling of themistletoe for consideration later on.—————————————————————Chapter LXIIThe Fire-Festivals of Europe1. THE FIRE-FESTIVALS IN GENERALALL over Europe the peasants have been accustomed from time immemorial to kindle bon-fires on certain days of the year, and to dance round or leap over them. Customs of this kindcan be traced back on historical evidence to the Middle Ages, and their analogy to similarcustoms observed in antiquity goes with strong internal evidence to prove that their originmust be sought in a period long prior to the spread of Christianity. Indeed the earliest proof oftheir observance in Northern Europe is furnished by the attempts made by Christian synodsin the eighth century to put them down as heathenish rites. Not uncommonly effigies areburned in these fires, or a pretence is made of burning a living person in them; and there aregrounds for believing that anciently human beings were actually burned on these occasions.Abrief view of the customs in question will bring out the traces of human sacrifice, and willserve at the same time to throw light on their meaning.The seasons of the year when these bonfires are most commonly lit are spring and midsum-mer; but in some places they are kindled also at the end of autumn or during the course ofthe winter, particularly on Hallow E’en (the thirty-first of October), Christmas Day, and the Eveof Twelfth Day. Space forbids me to describe all these festivals at length; a few specimensmust serve to illustrate their general character. We shall begin with the fire-festivals of spring,which usually fall on the first Sunday of Lent (Quadragesima or Invocavit), Easter Eve, andMay Day.2. THE LENTEN FIRESThe custom of kindling bonfires on the first Sunday in Lent has prevailed in Belgium, thePage 468"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"north of France, and many parts of Germany. Thus in the Belgian Ardennes for a week or afortnight before the “day of the great fire,” as it is called, children go about from farm to farmcollecting fuel. At Grand Halleux any one who refuses their request is pursued next day bythe children, who try to blacken his face with the ashes of the extinct fire. When the day hascome, they cut down bushes, especially juniper and broom, and in the evening great bonfiresblaze on all the heights. It is a common saying that seven bonfires should be seen if the vil-lage is to be safe from conflagrations. If the Meuse happens to be frozen hard at the time,bonfires are lit also on the ice. At Grand Halleux they set up a pole called makral, or “thewitch,” in the midst of the pile, and the fire is kindled by the man who was last married in thevillage. In the neighbourhood of Morlanwelz a straw man is burnt in the fire. Young peopleand children dance and sing round the bonfires, and leap over the embers to secure goodcrops or a happy marriage within the year, or as a means of guarding themselves againstcolic. In Brabant on the same Sunday, down to the beginning of the nineteenth century,women and men disguised in female attire used to go with burning torches to the fields,where they danced and sang comic songs for the purpose, as they alleged, of driving away“the wicked sower,” who is mentioned in the Gospel for the day. At Pâturages, in the provinceof Hainaut, down to about 1840 the custom was observed under the name of Escouvion orScouvion. Every year on the first Sunday of Lent, which was called the Day of the LittleScouvion, young folks and children used to run with lighted torches through the gardens andorchards. As they ran they cried at the pitch of their voices: “Bear apples, bear pears, and cherries all black To Scouvion!”At these words the torch-bearer whirled his blazing brand and hurled it among the branchesof the apple-trees, the pear-trees, and the cherry-trees. The next Sunday was called the Dayof the Great Scouvion, and the same race with lighted torches among the trees of theorchards was repeated in the afternoon till darkness fell.In the French department of the Ardennes the whole village used to dance and sing aroundthe bonfires which were lighted on the first Sunday in Lent. Here, too, it was the person lastmarried, sometimes a man and sometimes a woman, who put the match to the fire. The cus-tom is still kept up very commonly in the district. Cats used to be burnt in the fire or roasted todeath by being held over it; and while they were burning the shepherds drove their flocksthrough the smoke and flames as a sure means of guarding them against sickness and witch-craft. In some communes it was believed that the livelier the dance round the fire, the betterwould be the crops that year.In the French province of Franche-Comté, to the west of the Jura Mountains, the first Sundayof Lent is known as the Sunday of the Firebrands (Brandons), on account of the fires which itis customary to kindle on that day. On the Saturday or the Sunday the village lads harnessthemselves to a cart and drag it about the streets, stopping at the doors of the houses wherethere are girls and begging fora faggot. When they have got enough, they cart the fuel to aspot at some little distance from the village, pile it up, and set it on fire. All the people of theparish come out to see the bonfire. In some villages, when the bells have rung the Angelus,the signal for the observance is given by cries of, “To the fire! to the fire!” Lads, lasses, andchildren dance round the blaze, and when the flames have died down they vie with eachother in leaping over the red embers. He or she who does so without singeing his or her gar-ments will be married within the year. Young folk also carry lighted torches about the streetsor the fields, and when they pass an orchard they cry out, “More fruit than leaves!” Down toPage 469"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"recent years at Laviron, in the department of Doubs, it was the young married couples of theyear who had charge of the bonfires. In the midst of the bonfire a pole was planted with awooden figure of a cock fastened to the top. Then there were races, and the winner receivedthe cock as a prize.In Auvergne fires are everywhere kindled on the evening of the first Sunday in Lent. Every vil-lage, every hamlet, even every ward, every isolated farm has its bonfire or figo, as it is called,which blazes up as the shades of night are falling. The fires may be seen flaring on theheights and in the plains; the people dance and sing round about them and leap through theflames. Then they proceed to the ceremony of the Grannas-mias. A granno-mio is a torch ofstraw fastened to the top of a pole. When the pyre is half consumed, the bystanders kindlethe torches at the expiring flames and carry them into the neighbouring orchards, fields, andgardens, wherever there are fruit-trees. As they march they sing at the top of their voices,“Granno my friend, Granno my father, Granno my mother.” Then they pass the burning torch-es under the branches of every tree, singing. “Brando, brandounci tsaque brantso, in plan panei!” that is, “Firebrand burn; every branch a basketful!” In some villages the people also runacross the sown fields and shake the ashes of the torches on the ground; also they put someof the ashes in the fowls’ nests, in order that the hens may lay plenty of eggs throughout theyear. When all these ceremonies have been performed, everybody goes home and feasts;the special dishes of the evening are fritters and pancakes. Here the application of the fire tothe fruit-trees, to the sown fields, and to the nests of the poultry is clearly a charm intended toensure fertility; and the Granno to whom the invocations are addressed, and who gives hisname to the torches, may possibly be, as Dr. Pommerol suggests, no other than the ancientCeltic god Grannus, whom the Romans identified with Apollo, and whose worship is attestedby inscriptions found not only in France but in Scotland and on the Danube.The custom of carrying lighted torches of straw (brandons) about the orchards and fields tofertilise them on the first Sunday of Lent seems to have been common in France, whether itwas accompanied with the practice of kindling bonfires or not. Thus in the province of Picardy“on the first Sunday of Lent people carried torches through the fields, exorcising the field-mice, the darnel, and the smut. They imagined that they did much good to the gardens andcaused the onions to grow large. Children ran about the fields, torch in hand, to make theland more fertile.” At Verges, a village between the Jura and the Combe d’Ain, the torches atthis season were kindled on the top of a mountain, and the bearers went to every house inthe village, demanding roasted peas and obliging all couples who had been married withinthe year to dance. In Berry, a district of Central France, it appears that bonfires are not lightedon this day, but when the sun has set the whole population of the villages, armed with blazingtorches of straw, disperse over the country and scour the fields, the vineyards, and theorchards. Seen from afar, the multitude of moving lights, twinkling in the darkness, appear likewill-o’-the-wisps chasing each other across the plains, along the hillsides, and down the val-leys. While the men wave their flambeaus about the branches of the fruit-trees, the womenand children tie bands of wheaten-straw round the tree-trunks. The effect of the ceremony issupposed to be to avert the various plagues from which the fruits of the earth are apt to suf-fer; and the bands of straw fastened round the stems of the trees are believed to render themfruitful.In Germany, Austria, and Switzerland at the same season similar customs have prevailed.Page 470"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Thus in the Eifel Mountains, Rhenish Prussia, on the first Sunday in Lent young people usedto collect straw and brushwood from house to house. These they carried to an eminence andpiled up round a tall, slim beech-tree, to which a piece of wood was fastened at right anglesto form a cross. The structure was known as the “hut” or “castle.” Fire was set to it and theyoung people marched round the blazing “castle” bareheaded, each carrying a lighted torchand praying aloud. Sometimes a straw-man was burned in the “hut.” People observed thedirection in which the smoke blew from the fire. If it blew towards the corn-fields, it was a signthat the harvest would be abundant. On the same day, in some parts of the Eifel, a greatwheel was made of straw and dragged by three horses to the top of the hill. Thither the vil-lage boys marched at nightfall, set fire to the wheel, and sent it rolling down the slope. AtOberstattfeld the wheel had to be provided by the young man who was last married. AboutEchternach in Luxemburg the same ceremony is called “burning the witch.” At Voralberg inthe Tyrol, on the first Sunday in Lent, a slender young fir-tree is surrounded with a pile ofstraw and firewood. To the top of the tree is fastened a human figure called the “witch,” madeof old clothes and stuffed with gunpowder. At night the whole is set on fire and boys and girlsdance round it, swinging torches and singing rhymes in which the words “corn in the winnow-ing-basket, the plough in the earth” may be distinguished. In Swabia on the first Sunday inLent a figure called the “witch” or the “old wife” or “winter’s grandmother” is made up ofclothes and fastened to a pole. This is stuck in the middle of a pile of wood, to which fire isapplied. While the “witch” is burning, the young people throw blazing discs into the air. Thediscs are thin round pieces of wood, a few inches in diameter, with notched edges to imitatethe rays of the sun or stars. They have a hole in the middle, by which they are attached to theend of a wand. Before the disc is thrown it is set on fire, the wand is swung to and fro, andthe impetus thus communicated to the disc is augmented by dashing the rod sharply againsta sloping board. The burning disc is thus thrown off, and mounting high into the air, describesa long fiery curve before it reaches the ground. The charred embers of the burned “witch” anddiscs are taken home and planted in the flax-fields the same night, in the belief that they willkeep vermin from the fields. In the Rhön Mountains, situated on the borders of Hesse andBavaria, the people used to march to the top of a hill or eminence on the first Sunday in Lent.Children and lads carried torches, brooms daubed with tar, and poles swathed in straw. Awheel, wrapt in combustibles, was kindled and rolled down the hill; and the young peoplerushed about the fields with their burning torches and brooms, till at last they flung them in aheap, and standing round them, struck up a hymn or a popular song. The object of runningabout the fields with the blazing torches was to “drive away the wicked sower.” Or it was donein honour of the Virgin, that she might preserve the fruits of the earth throughout the year andbless them. In neighbouring villages of Hesse, between the Rhön and the Vogel Mountains, itis thought that wherever the burning wheels roll, the fields will be safe from hail and strom.In Switzerland, also, it is or used to be customary to kindle bonfires on high places on theevening of the first Sunday in Lent, and the day is therefore popularly known as SparkSunday. The custom prevailed, for example, throughout the canton of Lucerne. Boys wentabout from house to house begging for wood and straw, then piled the fuel on a conspicuousmountain or hill round about a pole, which bore a straw effigy called “the witch.” At nightfallthe pile was set on fire, and the young folks danced wildly round it, some of them crackingwhips or ringing bells; and when the fire burned low enough, they leaped over it. This wascalled “burning the witch.” In some parts of the canton also they used to wrap old wheels instraw and thorns, put a light to them, and send them rolling and blazing down hill. The morebonfires could be seen sparkling and flaring in the darkness, the more fruitful was the yearexpected to be; and the higher the dancers leaped beside or over the fire, the higher, it wasthought, would grow the flax. In some districts it was the last married man or woman whoPage 471"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"must kindle the bonfire.It seems hardly possible to separate from these bonfires, kindled on the first Sunday in Lent,the fires in which, about the same season, the effigy called Death is burned as part of the cer-emony of “carrying out Death.” We have seen that at Spachendorf, in Austrian Silesia, on themorning of Rupert’s Day (Shrove Tuesday?), a straw-man, dressed in a fur coat and a furcap, is laid in a hole outside the village and there burned, and that while it is blazing everyone seeks to snatch a fragment of it, which he fastens to a branch of the highest tree in hisgarden or buries in his field, believing that this will make the crops to grow better. The cere-mony is known as the “burying of Death.” Even when the straw-man is not designated asDeath, the meaning of the observance is probably the same; for the name Death, as I havetried to show, does not express the original intention of the ceremony. At Cobern in the EifelMountains the lads make up a straw-man on Shrove Tuesday. The effigy is formally tried andaccused of having perpetrated all the thefts that have been committed in the neighbourhoodthroughout the year. Being condemned to death, the straw-man is led through the village,shot, and burned upon a pyre. They dance round the blazing pile, and the last bride mustleap over it. In Oldenburg on the evening of Shrove Tuesday people used to make long bun-dles of straw, which they set on fire, and then ran about the fields waving them, shrieking,and singing wild songs. Finally they burned a straw-man on the field. In the district ofDüsseldorf the straw-man burned on Shrove Tuesday was made of an unthreshed sheaf ofcorn. On the first Monday after the spring equinox the urchins of Zurich drag a straw-man ona little cart through the streets, while at the same time the girls carry about a May-tree. Whenvespers ring, the straw-man is burned. In the district of Aachen on Ash Wednesday, a manused to be encased in peas-straw and taken to an appointed place. Here he slipped quietlyout of his straw casing, which was then burned, the children thinking that it was the man whowas being burned. In the Val di Ledro (Tyrol) on the last day of the Carnival a figure is madeup of straw and brushwood and then burned. The figure is called the Old Woman, and theceremony “burning the Old Woman.”3. THE EASTER FIRESAnother occasion on which these fire-festivals are held is Easter Eve, the Saturday beforeEaster Sunday. On that day it has been customary in Catholic countries to extinguish all thelights in the churches, and then to make a new fire, sometimes with flint and steel, sometimeswith a burning-glass. At this fire is lit the great Paschal or Easter candle, which is then usedto rekindle all the extinguished lights in the church. In many parts of Germany a bonfire isalso kindled, by means of the new fire, on some open space near the church. It is consecrat-ed, and the people bring sticks of oak, walnut, and beech, which they char in the fire, andthen take home with them. Some of these charred sticks are thereupon burned at home in anewly-kindled fire, with a prayer that God will preserve the homestead from fire, lightning, andhail. Thus every house receives “new fire.” Some of the sticks are kept throughout the yearand laid on the hearth-fire during heavy thunder-storms to prevent the house from beingstruck by lightning, or they are inserted in the roof with the like intention. Others are placed inthe fields, gardens, and meadows, with a prayer that God will keep them from blight and hail.Such fields and gardens are thought to thrive more than others; the corn and the plants thatgrow in them are not beaten down by hail, nor devoured by mice, vermin, and beetles; nowitch harms them, and the ears of corn stand close and full. The charred sticks are alsoapplied to the plough. The ashes of the Easter bonfire, together with the ashes of the conse-crated palm-branches, are mixed with the seed at sowing. A wooden figure called Judas issometimes burned in the consecrated bonfire, and even where this custom has been abol-Page 472"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"ished the bonfire itself in some places goes by the name of “the burning of Judas.”The essentially pagan character of the Easter fire festival appears plainly both from the modein which it is celebrated by the peasants and from the superstitious beliefs which they associ-ate with it. All over Northern and Central Germany, from Altmark and Anhalt on the east,through Brunswick, Hanover, Oldenburg, the Harz district, and Hesse to Westphalia theEaster bonfires still blaze simultaneously on the hill-tops. As many as forty may sometimes becounted within sight at once. Long before Easter the young people have been busy collectingfirewood; every farmer contributes, and tar-barrels, petroleum cases, and so forth go to swellthe pile. Neighbouring villages vie with each other as to which shall send up the greatestblaze. The fires are always kindled, year after year, on the same hill, which accordingly oftentakes the name of Easter Mountain. It is a fine spectacle to watch from some eminence thebonfires flaring up one after another on the neighbouring heights. As far as their light reaches,so far, in the belief of the peasants, the fields will be fruitful, and the houses on which theyshine will be safe from conflagration or sickness. At Volkmarsen and other places in Hessethe people used to observe which way the wind blew the flames, and then they sowed flaxseed in that direction, confident that it would grow well. Brands taken from the bonfires pre-serve houses from being struck by lightning; and the ashes increase the fertility of the fields,protect them from mice, and mixed with the drinking-water of cattle make the animals thriveand ensure them against plague. As the flames die down, young and old leap over them, andcattle are sometimes driven through the smouldering embers. In some places tar-barrels orwheels wrapt in straw used to be set on fire, and then sent rolling down the hillside. In othersthe boys light torches and wisps of straw at the bonfires and rush about brandishing them intheir hands.In Münsterland these Easter fires are always kindled upon certain definite hills, which arehence known as Easter or Paschal Mountains. The whole community assembles about thefire. The young men and maidens, singing Easter hymns, march round and round the fire, tillthe blaze dies down. Then the girls jump over the fire in a line, one after the other, each sup-ported by two young men who hold her hands and run beside her. In the twilight boys withblazing bundles of straw run over the fields to make them fruitful. At Delmenhorst, inOldenburg, it used to be the custom to cut down two trees, plant them in the ground side byside, and pile twelve tar-barrels against each. Brush-wood was then heaped about the trees,and on the evening of Easter Saturday the boys, after rushing about with blazing bean-polesin their hands, set fire to the whole. At the end of the ceremony the urchins tried to blackeneach other and the clothes of grown-up people. In the Altmark it is believed that as far as theblaze of the Easter bonfire is visible, the corn will grow well throughout the year, and no con-flagration will break out. At Braunröde, in the Harz Mountains, it was the custom to burn squir-rels in the Easter bonfire. In the Altmark, bones were burned in it.Near Forchheim, in Upper Franken, a straw-man called the Judas used to be burned in thechurchyards on Easter Saturday. The whole village contributed wood to the pyre on which heperished, and the charred sticks were afterwards kept and planted in the fields on WalpurgisDay (the first of May) to preserve the wheat from blight and mildew. About a hundred yearsago or more the custom at Althenneberg, in Upper Bavaria, used to be as follows. On theafternoon of Easter Saturday the lads collected wood, which they piled in a cornfield, while inthe middle of the pile they set up a tall wooden cross all swathed in straw. After the eveningservice they lighted their lanterns at the consecrated candle in the church, and ran with themat full speed to the pyre, each striving to get there first. The first to arrive set fire to the heap.No woman or girl might come near the bonfire, but they were allowed to watch it from a dis-Page 473"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"tance. As the flames rose the men and lads rejoiced and made merry, shouting, “We areburning the Judas!” The man who had been the first to reach the pyre and to kindle it wasrewarded on Easter Sunday by the women, who gave him coloured eggs at the church door.The object of the whole ceremony was to keep off the hail. At other villages of Upper Bavariathe ceremony, which took place between nine and ten at night on Easter Saturday, was called“burning the Easter Man.” On a height about a mile from the village the young fellows set upa tall cross enveloped in straw, so that it looked like a man with his arms stretched out. Thiswas the Easter Man. No lad under eighteen years of age might take part in the ceremony.One of the young men stationed himself beside the Easter Man, holding in his hand a conse-crated taper which he had brought from the church and lighted. The rest stood at equal inter-vals in a great circle round the cross. At a given signal they raced thrice round the circle, andthen at a second signal ran straight at the cross and at the lad with the lighted taper beside it;the one who reached the goal first had the right of setting fire to the Easter Man. Great wasthe jubilation while he was burning. When he had been consumed in the flames, three ladswere chosen from among the rest, and each of the three drew a circle on the ground with astick thrice round the ashes. Then they all left the spot. On Easter Monday the villagers gath-ered the ashes and strewed them on their fields; also they planted in the fields palmbrancheswhich had been consecrated on Palm Sunday, and sticks which had been charred and hal-lowed on Good Friday, all for the purpose of protecting their fields against showers of hail. Insome parts of Swabia the Easter fires might not be kindled with iron or steel or flint, but onlyby the friction of wood.The custom of the Easter fires appears to have prevailed all over Central and WesternGermany from north to south. We find it also in Holland, where the fires were kindled on thehighest eminences, and the people danced round them and leaped through the flames orover the glowing embers. Here too, as often in Germany, the materials for the bonfire werecollected by the young folk from door to door. In many parts of Sweden firearms are dis-charged in all directions on Easter Eve, and huge bonfires are lighted on hills and eminences.Some people think that the intention is to keep off the Troll and other evil spirits who areespecially active at this season.4. THE BELTANE FIRESIn the central Highlands of Scotland bonfires, known as the Beltane fires, were formerly kin-dled with great ceremony on the first of May, and the traces of human sacrifices at them wereparticularly clear and unequivocal. The custom of lighting the bonfires lasted in various placesfar into the eighteenth century, and the descriptions of the ceremony by writers of that periodpresent such a curious and interesting picture of ancient heathendom surviving in our owncountry that I will reproduce them in the words of their authors. The fullest of the descriptionsis the one bequeathed to us by John Ramsay, laird of Ochtertyre, near Crieff, the patron ofBurns and the friend of Sir Walter Scott. He says: “But the most considerable of the Druidicalfestivals is that of Beltane, or May-day, which was lately observed in some parts of theHighlands with extraordinary ceremonies.... Like the other public worship of the Druids, theBeltane feast seems to have been performed on hills or eminences. They thought it degrad-ing to him whose temple is the universe, to suppose that he would dwell in any house madewith hands. Their sacrifices were therefore offered in the open air, frequently upon the tops ofhills, where they were presented with the grandest views of nature, and were nearest the seatof warmth and order. And, according to tradition, such was the manner of celebrating this fes-tival in the Highlands within the last hundred years. Butsince the decline of superstition, it has been celebrated by the people of each hamlet onPage 474"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"some hill or rising ground around which their cattle were pasturing. Thither the young folksrepaired in the morning, and cut a trench, on the summit of which a seat of turf was formedfor the company. And in the middle a pile of wood or other fuel was placed, which of old theykindled with tein-eigin—i.e., forced-fire or need-fire. Although, for many years past, they havebeen contented with common fire, yet we shall now describe the process, because it willhereafter appear that recourse is still had to the tein-eigin upon extraordinary emergencies. “The night before, all the fires in the country were carefully extinguished, and next morningthe materials for exciting this sacred fire were prepared. The most primitive method seems tobe that which was used in the islands of Skye, Mull, and Tiree. A well-seasoned plank of oakwas procured, in the midst of which a hole was bored. A wimble of the same timber was thenapplied, the end of which they fitted to the hole. But in some parts of the mainland themachinery was different. They used a frame of green wood, of a square form, in the centre ofwhich was an axle-tree. In some places three times three persons, in others three times nine,were required for turning round by turns the axle-tree or wimble. If any of them had beenguilty of murder, adultery, theft, or other atrocious crime, it was imagined either that the firewould not kindle, or that it would be devoid of its usual virtue. So soon as any sparks wereemitted by means of the violent friction, they applied a species of agaric which grows on oldbirch-trees, and is very combustible. This fire had the appearance of being immediatelyderived from heaven, and manifold were the virtues ascribed to it. They esteemed it a preser-vative against witch-craft, and a sovereign remedy against malignant diseases, both in thehuman species and in cattle; and by it the strongest poisons were supposed to have theirnature changed.“After kindling the bonfire with the tein-eigin the company prepared their victuals. And as soonas they had finished their meal, they amused themselves a while in singing and dancinground the fire. Towards the close of the entertainment, the person who officiated as master ofthe feast produced a large cake baked with eggs and scalloped round the edge, called ambonnach bea-tine—i.e., the Beltane cake. It was divided into a number of pieces, and distrib-uted in great form to the company. There was one particular piece which whoever got wascalled cailleach beal-tine—i.e., the Beltane carline, a term of great reproach. Upon his beingknown, part of the company laid hold of him and made a show of putting him into the fire; butthe majority interposing, he was rescued. And in some places they laid him flat on the ground,making as if they would quarter him. Afterwards, he was pelted with egg-shells, and retainedthe odious appellation during the whole year. And while the feast was fresh in people’s mem-ory, they affected to speak of the cailleach beal-tine as dead.”In the parish of Callander, a beautiful district of Western Perthshire, the Beltane custom wasstill in vogue towards the end of the eighteenth century. It has been described as follows bythe parish minister of the time: “Upon the first day of May, which is called Beltan, or Balteinday, all the boys in a township or hamlet, meet in the moors. They cut a table in the greensod, of a round figure, by casting a trench in the ground, of such circumference as to hold thewhole company. They kindle a fire, and dress a repast of eggs and milk in the consistence ofa custard. They knead a cake of oatmeal, which is toasted at the embers against a stone.After the custard is eaten up, they divide the cake into so many portions, as similar as possi-ble to one another in size and shape, as there are persons in the company. They daub one ofthese portions all over with charcoal, until it be perfectly black. They put all the bits of thecake into a bonnet. Every one, blindfold, draws out a portion. He who holds the bonnet, isentitled to the last bit. Whoever draws the black bit, is the devoted person who is to be sacri-ficed to Baal, whose favour they mean to implore, in rendering the year productive of the sus-Page 475"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"tenance of man and beast. There is little doubt of these inhuman sacrifices having been onceoffered in this country, as well as in the east, although they now pass from the act of sacrific-ing, and only compel the devoted person to leap three times through the flames; with whichthe ceremonies of this festival are closed.”Thomas Pennant, who travelled in Perthshire in the year 1769, tells us that “on the first ofMay, the herdsmen of every village hold their Bel-tien, a rural sacrifice. They cut a squaretrench on the ground, leaving the turf in the middle; on that they make a fire of wood, onwhich they dress a large caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal and milk; and bring besides theingredients of the caudle, plenty of beer and whisky; for each of the company must contributesomething. The rites begin with spilling some of the caudle on the ground, by way of libation:on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal, upon which are raised nine square knobs, eachdedicated to some particular being, the supposed preserver of their flocks and herds, or tosome particular animal, the real destroyer of them: each person then turns his face to the fire,breaks off a knob, and flinging it over his shoulders, says, ‘This I give to thee, preserve thoumy horses; this to thee, preserve thou my sheep; and so on.’ After that, they use the sameceremony to the noxious animals: ‘This I give to thee, O fox! spare thou my lambs; this tothee, O hooded crow! this to thee, O eagle!’ When the ceremony is over, they dine on thecaudle; and after the feast is finished, what is left is hid by two persons deputed for that pur-pose; but on the next Sunday they reassemble, and finish the reliques of the first entertain-ment.”Another writer of the eighteenth century has described the Beltane festival as it was held inthe parish of Logierait in Perthshire. He says: “On the first of May, O.S., a festival calledBeltan is annually held here. It is chiefly celebrated by the cow-herds, who assemble byscores in the fields, to dress a dinner for themselves, of boiled milk and eggs. These dishesthey eat with a sort of cakes baked for the occasion, and having small lumps in the form ofnipples, raised all over the surface.” In this last account no mention is made of bonfires, butthey were probably lighted, for a contemporary writer informs us that in the parish ofKirkmichael, which adjoins the parish of Logierait on the east, the custom of lighting a fire inthe fields and baking a consecrated cake on the first of May was not quite obsolete in histime. We may conjecture that the cake with knobs was formerly used for the purpose of deter-mining who should be the “Beltane carline” or victim doomed to the flames. A trace of thiscustom survived, perhaps, in the custom of baking oatmeal cakes of a special kind and rollingthem down hill about noon on the first of May; for it was thought that the person whose cakebroke as it rolled would die or be unfortunate within the year. These cakes, or bannocks aswe call them in Scotland, were baked in the usual way, but they were washed over with a thinbatter composed of whipped egg, milk or cream, and a little oatmeal. This custom appears tohave prevailed at or near Kingussie in Inverness-shire.In the north-east of Scotland the Beltane fires were still kindled in the latter half of the eigh-teenth century; the herdsmen of several farms used to gather dry wood, kindle it, and dancethree times “southways” about the burning pile. But in this region, according to a later authori-ty, the Beltane fires were lit not on the first but on the second of May, Old Style. They werecalled bone-fires. The people believed that on that evening and night the witches were abroadand busy casting spells on cattle and stealing cows’ milk. To counteract their machinations,pieces of rowan-tree and woodbine, but especially of rowan-tree, were placed over the doorsof the cow-houses, and fires were kindled by every farmer and cottar. Old thatch, straw, furze,or broom was piled in a heap and set on fire a little after sunset. While some of thebystanders kept tossing the blazing mass, others hoisted portions of it on pitchforks or polesPage 476"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"and ran hither and thither, holding them as high as they could. Meantime the young peopledanced round the fire or ran through the smoke shouting, “Fire! blaze and burn the witches;fire! fire! burn the witches.” In some districts a large round cake of oat or barley meal wasrolled through the ashes. When all the fuel was consumed, the people scattered the ashes farand wide, and till the night grew quite dark they continued to run through them, crying, “Fire!burn the witches.”In the Hebrides “the Beltane bannock is smaller than that made at St. Michael’s, but is madein the same way; it is no longer made in Uist, but Father Allan remembers seeing his grand-mother make one about twenty-five years ago. There was also a cheese made, generally onthe first of May, which was kept to the next Beltane as a sort of charm against the bewitchingof milk-produce. The Beltane customs seem to have been the same as elsewhere. Every firewas put out and a large one lit on the top of the hill, and the cattle driven round it sunwards(dessil), to keep off murrain all the year. Each man would take home fire wherewith to kindlehis own.”In Wales also the custom of lighting Beltane fires at the beginning of May used to beobserved, but the day on which they were kindled varied from the eve of May Day to the thirdof May. The flame was sometimes elicited by the friction of two pieces of oak, as appearsfrom the following description. “The fire was done in this way. Nine men would turn their pock-ets inside out, and see that every piece of money and all metals were off their persons. Thenthe men went into the nearest woods, and collected sticks of nine different kinds of trees.These were carried to the spot where the fire had to be built. There a circle was cut in thesod, and the sticks were set crosswise. All around the circle the people stood and watchedthe proceedings. One of the men would then take two bits of oak, and rub them together untila flame was kindled. This was applied to the sticks, and soon a large fire was made.Sometimes two fires were set up side by side. These fires, whether one or two, were calledcoelcerth or bonfire. Round cakes of oatmeal and brown meal were split in four, and placed ina small flour-bag, and everybody present had to pick out a portion. The last bit in the bag fellto the lot of the bag-holder. Each person who chanced to pick up a piece of brown-meal cakewas compelled to leap three times over the flames, or to run thrice between the two fires, bywhich means the people thought they were sure of a plentiful harvest. Shouts and screams ofthose who had to face the ordeal could be heard ever so far, and those who chanced to pickthe oatmeal portions sang and danced and clapped their hands in approval, as the holders ofthe brown bits leaped three times over the flames, or ran three times between the two fires.”The belief of the people that by leaping thrice over the bonfires or running thrice betweenthem they ensured a plentiful harvest is worthy of note. The mode in which this result wassupposed to be brought about is indicated by another writer on Welsh folk-lore, according towhom it used to be held that “the bonfires lighted in May or Midsummer protected the landsfrom sorcery, so that good crops would follow. The ashes were also considered valuable ascharms.” Hence it appears that the heat of the fires was thought to fertilise the fields, notdirectly by quickening the seeds in the ground, but indirectly by counteracting the baleful influ-ence of witchcraft or perhaps by burning up the persons of the witches.The Beltane fires seem to have been kindled also in Ireland, for Cormac, “or somebody in hisname, says that belltaine, May-day, was so called from the ‘lucky fire,’ or the ‘two fires,’ whichthe druids of Erin used to make on that day with great incantations; and cattle, he adds, usedto be brought to those fires, or to be driven between them, as a safeguard against the dis-eases of the year.” The custom of driving cattle through or between fires on May Day or thePage 477"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"eve of May Day persisted in Ireland down to a time within living memory.The first of May is a great popular festival in the more midland and southern parts of Sweden.On the eve of the festival huge bonfires, which should be lighted by striking two flints togeth-er, blaze on all the hills and knolls. Every large hamlet has its own fire, round which theyoung people dance in a ring. The old folk notice whether the flames incline to the north or tothe south. In the former case, the spring will be cold and backward; in the latter, it will be mildand genial. In Bohemia, on the eve of May Day, young people kindle fires on hills and emi-nences, at crossways, and in pastures, and dance round them. They leap over the glowingembers or even through the flames. The ceremony is called “burning the witches.” In someplaces an effigy representing a witch used to be burnt in the bonfire. We have to rememberthat the eve of May Day is the notorious Walpurgis Night, when the witches are everywherespeeding unseen through the air on their hellish errands. On this witching night children inVoigtland also light bonfires on the heights and leap over them. Moreover, they wave burningbrooms or toss them into the air. So far as the light of the bonfire reaches, so far will a bless-ing rest on the fields. The kindling of the fires on Walpurgis Night is called “driving away thewitches.” The custom of kindling fires on the eve of May Day (Walpurgis Night) for the pur-pose of burning the witches is, or used to be, widespread in the Tyrol, Moravia, Saxony andSilesia.5. THE MIDSUMMER FIRESBut the season at which these firefestivals have been most generally held all over Europe isthe summer solstice, that is Midsummer Eve (the twenty-third of June) or Midsummer day(the twenty-fourth of June). A faint tinge of Christianity has been given to them by namingMidsummer Day after St. John the Baptist, but we cannot doubt that the celebration datesfrom a time long before the beginning of our era. The summer solstice, or Midsummer Day, isthe great turning-point in the sun’s career, when, after climbing higher and higher day by dayin the sky, the luminary stops and thenceforth retraces his steps down the heavenly road.Such a moment could not but be regarded with anxiety by primitive man so soon as he beganto observe and ponder the courses of the great lights across the celestial vault; and havingstill to learn his own powerlessness in face of the vast cyclic changes of nature, he may havefancied that he could help the sun in his seeming decline—could prop his failing steps andrekindle the sinking flame of the red lamp in his feeble hand. In some such thoughts as thesethe midsummer festivals of our European peasantry may perhaps have taken their rise.Whatever their origin, they have prevailed all over this quarter of the globe, from Ireland onthe west to Russia on the east, and from Norway and Sweden on the north to Spain andGreece on the south. According to a mediaeval writer, the three great features of the midsum-mer celebration were the bonfires, the procession with torches round the fields, and the cus-tom of rolling a wheel. He tells us that boys burned bones and filth of various kinds to make afoul smoke, and that the smoke drove away certain noxious dragons which at this time, excit-ed by the summer heat, copulated in the air and poisoned the wells and rivers by droppingtheir seed into them; and he explains the custom of trundling a wheel to mean that the sun,having now reached the highest point in the ecliptic, begins thenceforward to descend. The main features of the midsummer fire-festival resemble those which we have found tocharacterise the vernal festivals of fire. The similarity of the two sets of ceremonies will plainlyappear from the following examples. Awriter of the first half of the sixteenth century informs us that in almost every village andPage 478"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"town of Germany public bonfires were kindled on the Eve of St. John, and young and old, ofboth sexes, gathered about them and passed the time in dancing and singing. People on thisoccasion wore chaplets of mugwort and vervain, and they looked at the fire through bunchesof larkspur which they held in their hands, believing that this would preserve their eyes in ahealthy state throughout the year. As each departed, he threw the mugwort and vervain intothe fire, saying, “May all my ill-luck depart and be burnt up with these.” At Lower Konz, a vil-lage situated on a hillside overlooking the Moselle, the midsummer festival used to be cele-brated as follows. A quantity of straw was collected on the top of the steep Stromberg Hill.Every inhabitant, or at least every householder, had to contribute his share of straw to thepile. At nightfall the whole male population, men and boys, mustered on the top of the hill; thewomen and girls were not allowed to join them, but had to take up their position at a certainspring half-way down the slope. On the summit stood a huge wheel completely encased insome of the straw which had been jointly contributed by the villagers; the rest of the strawwas made into torches. From each side of the wheel the axle-tree projected about three feet,thus furnishing handles to the lads who were to guide it in its descent. The mayor of theneighbouring town of Sierck, who always received a basket of cherries for his services, gavethe signal; a lighted torch was applied to the wheel, and as it burst into flame, two young fel-lows, strong-limbed and swift of foot, seized the handles and began running with it down theslope. A great shout went up. Every man and boy waved a blazing torch in the air, and tookcare to keep it alight so long as the wheel was trundling down the hill. The great object of theyoung men who guided the wheel was to plunge it blazing into the water of the Moselle; butthey rarely succeeded in their efforts, for the vineyards which cover the greater part of thedeclivity impeded their progress, and the wheel was often burned out before it reached theriver. As it rolled past the women and girls at the spring, they raised cries of joy which wereanswered by the men on the top of the mountain; and the shouts were echoed by the inhabi-tants of neighbouring villages who watched the spectacle from their hills on the opposite bankof the Moselle. If the fiery wheel was successfully conveyed to the bank of the river and extin-guished in the water, the people looked for an abundant vintage that year, and the inhabitantsof Konz had the right to exact a waggon-load of white wine from the surrounding vineyards.On the other hand, they believed that, if they neglected to perform the ceremony, the cattlewould be attacked by giddiness and convulsions and would dance in their stalls.Down at least to the middle of the nineteenth century the midsummer fires used to blaze allover Upper Bavaria. They were kindled especially on the mountains, but also far and wide inthe lowlands, and we are told that in the darkness and stillness of night the moving groups, litup by the flickering glow of the flames, presented an impressive spectacle. Cattle were driventhrough the fire to cure the sick animals and to guard such as were sound against plague andharm of every kind throughout the year. Many a householder on that day put out the fire onthe domestic hearth and rekindled it by means of a brand taken from the midsummer bonfire.The people judged of the height to which the flax would grow in the year by the height towhich the flames of the bonfire rose; and whoever leaped over the burning pile was sure notto suffer from backache in reaping the corn at harvest. In many parts of Bavaria it wasbelieved that the flax would grow as high as the young people leaped over the fire. In othersthe old folk used to plant three charred sticks from the bonfire in the fields, believing that thiswould make the flax grow tall. Elsewhere an extinguished brand was put in the roof of thehouse to protect it against fire. In the towns about Würzburg the bonfires used to be kindledin the market-places, and the young people who jumped over them wore garlands of flowers,especially of mugwort and vervain, and carried sprigs of larkspur in their hands. They thoughtthat such as looked at the fire holding a bit of larkspur before their face would be troubled byno malady of the eyes throughout the year. Further, it was customary at Würzburg, in the six-Page 479"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"teenth century, for the bishop’s followers to throw burning discs of wood into the air from amountain which overhangs the town. The discs were discharged by means of flexible rods,and in their flight through the darkness presented the appearance of fiery dragons.Similarly in Swabia, lads and lasses, hand in hand, leap over the midsummer bonfire, prayingthat the hemp may grow three ells high, and they set fire to wheels of straw and send themrolling down the hill. Sometimes, as the people sprang over the midsummer bonfire they criedout, “Flax, flax! may the flax this year grow seven ells high!” At Rottenburg a rude effigy inhuman form, called the Angelman, used to be enveloped in flowers and then burnt in the mid-summer fire by boys, who afterwards leaped over the glowing embers.So in Baden the children collected fuel from house to house for the midsummer bonfire on St.John’s Day; and lads and lasses leaped over the fire in couples. Here, as elsewhere, a closeconnexion was traced between these bonfires and the harvest. In some places it was thoughtthat those who leaped over the fires would not suffer from backache at reaping. Sometimes,as the young folk sprang over the flames, they cried, “Grow, that the hemp may be three ellshigh!” This notion that the hemp or the corn would grow as high as the flames blazed or asthe people jumped over them, seems to have been widespread in Baden. It was held that theparents of the young people who bounded highest over the fire would have the most abun-dant harvest; and on the other hand, if a man contributed nothing to the bonfire, it was imag-ined that there would be no blessing on his crops, and that his hemp in particular would nevergrow. At Edersleben, near Sangerhausen, a high pole was planted in the ground and a tarbar-rel was hung from it by a chain which reached to the ground. The barrel was then set on fireand swung round the pole amid shouts of joy.In Denmark and Norway also midsummer fires were kindled on St. John’s Eve on roads,open spaces, and hills. People in Norway thought that the fires banished sickness fromamong the cattle. Even yet the fires are said to be lighted all over Norway on MidsummerEve. They are kindled in order to keep off the witches, who are said to be flying from all partsthat night to the Blocksberg, where the big witch lives. In Sweden the Eve of St. John (St.Hans) is the most joyous night of the whole year. Throughout some parts of the country,especially in the provinces of Bohus and Scania and in districts bordering on Norway, it is cel-ebrated by the frequent discharge of firearms and by huge bonfires, formerly called Balder’sBalefires (Balder’s Balar), which are kindled at dusk on hills and eminences and throw a glareof light over the surrounding landscape. The people dance round the fires and leap over orthrough them. In parts of Norrland on St. John’s Eve the bonfires are lit at the cross-roads.The fuel consists of nine different sorts of wood, and the spectators cast into the flames akind of toad-stool (Bäran) in order to counteract the power of the Trolls and other evil spirits,who are believed to be abroad that night; for at that mystic season the mountains open andfrom their cavernous depths the uncanny crew pours forth to dance and disport themselvesfor a time. The peasants believe that should any of the Trolls be in the vicinity they will showthemselves; and if an animal, for example a he or she goat, happens to be seen near theblazing, crackling pile, the peasants are firmly persuaded that it is no other than the Evil Onein person. Further, it deserves to be remarked that in Sweden St. John’s Eve is a festival ofwater as well as of fire; for certain holy springs are then supposed to be endowed with won-derful medicinal virtues, and many sick people resort to them for the healing of their infirmi-ties.In Austria the midsummer customs and superstitions resemble those of Germany. Thus insome parts of the Tyrol bonfires are kindled and burning discs hurled into the air. In the lowerPage 480"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"valley of the Inn a tatterdemalion effigy is carted about the village on Midsummer Day andthen burned. He is called the Lotter, which has been corrupted into Luther. At Ambras, one ofthe villages where Martin Luther is thus burned in effigy, they say that if you go through thevillage between eleven and twelve on St. John’s Night and wash yourself in three wells, youwill see all who are to die in the following year. At Gratz on St. John’s Eve (the twenty-third ofJune) the common people used to make a puppet called the Tatermann, which they draggedto the bleaching ground, and pelted with burning besoms till it took fire. At Reutte, in the Tyrol,people believed that the flax would grow as high as they leaped over the midsummer bonfire,and they took pieces of charred wood from the fire and stuck them in their flax-fields thesame night, leaving them there till the flax harvest had been got in. In Lower Austria bonfiresare kindled on the heights, and the boys caper round them, brandishing lighted torchesdrenched in pitch. Whoever jumps thrice across the fire will not suffer from fever within theyear. Cart-wheels are often smeared with pitch, ignited, and sent rolling and blazing down thehillsides.All over Bohemia bonfires still burn on Midsummer Eve. In the afternoon boys go about withhandcarts from house to house collecting fuel and threatening with evil consequences thecurmudgeons who refuse them a dole. Sometimes the young men fell a tall straight fir in thewoods and set it up on a height, where the girls deck it with nosegays, wreaths of leaves, andred ribbons. Then brushwood is piled about it, and at nightfall the whole is set on fire. Whilethe flames break out, the young men climb the tree and fetch down the wreaths which thegirls had placed on it. After that lads and lasses stand on opposite sides of the fire and look atone another through the wreaths to see whether they will be true to each other and marrywithin the year. Also the girls throw the wreaths across the flames to the men, and woe to theawkward swain who fails to catch the wreath thrown him by his sweetheart. When the blazehas died down, each couple takes hands and leaps thrice across the fire. He or she whodoes so will be free from ague throughout the year, and the flax will grow as high as theyoung folks leap. A girl who sees nine bonfires on Midsummer Eve will marry before the yearis out. The singed wreaths are carried home and carefully preserved throughout the year.During thunderstorms a bit of the wreath is burned on the hearth with a prayer; some of it isgiven to kine that are sick or calving, and some of it serves to fumigate house and cattle-stall,that man and beast may keep hale and well. Sometimes an old cart-wheel is smeared withresin, ignited, and sent rolling down the hill. Often the boys collect all the worn-out besomsthey can get hold of, dip them in pitch, and having set them on fire wave them about or throwthem high into the air. Or they rush down the hillside in troops, brandishing the flamingbrooms and shouting. The stumps of the brooms and embers from the fire are preserved andstuck in cabbage gardens to protect the cabbages from caterpillars and gnats. Some peopleinsert charred sticks and ashes from the midsummer bonfire in their sown fields and mead-ows, in their gardens and the roofs of their houses, as a talisman against lightning and foulweather; or they fancy that the ashes placed in the roof will prevent any fire from breaking outin the house. In some districts they crown or gird themselves with mugwort while the midsum-mer fire is burning, for this is supposed to be a protection against ghosts, witches, and sick-ness; in particular, a wreath of mugwort is a sure preventive of sore eyes. Sometimes thegirls look at the bonfires through garlands of wild flowers, praying the fire to strengthen theireyes and eyelids. She who does this thrice will have no sore eyes all that year. In some partsof Bohemia they used to drive the cows through the midsummer fire to guard them againstwitchcraft.In Slavonic countries, also, the midsummer festival is celebrated with similar rites. We havealready seen that in Russia on the Eve of St. John young men and maidens jump over a bon-Page 481"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"fire in couples carrying a straw effigy of Kupalo in their arms. In some parts of Russia animage of Kupalo is burnt or thrown into a stream on St. John’s Night. Again, in some districtsof Russia the young folk wear garlands of flowers and girdles of holy herbs when they springthrough the smoke or flames; and sometimes they drive the cattle also through the fire inorder to protect the animals against wizards and witches, who are then ravenous after milk. InLittle Russia a stake is driven into the ground on St. John’s Night, wrapt in straw, and set onfire. As the flames rise the peasant women throw birchen boughs into them, saying, “May myflax be as tall as this bough!” In Ruthenia the bonfires are lighted by a flame procured by thefriction of wood. While the elders of the party are engaged in thus “churning” the fire, the restmaintain a respectful silence; but when the flame bursts from the wood, they break forth intojoyous songs. As soon as the bonfires are kindled, the young people take hands and leap inpairs through the smoke, if not through the flames; and after that the cattle in their turn aredriven through the fire.In many parts of Prussia and Lithuania great fires are kindled on Midsummer Eve. All theheights are ablaze with them, as far as the eye can see. The fires are supposed to be a pro-tection against witchcraft, thunder, hail, and cattle disease, especially if next morning the cat-tle are driven over the places where the fires burned. Above all, the bonfires ensure thefarmer against the arts of witches, who try to steal the milk from his cows by charms andspells. That is why next morning you may see the young fellows who lit the bonfire going fromhouse to house and receiving jugfuls of milk. And for the same reason they stick burs andmugwort on the gate or the hedge through which the cows go to pasture, because that is sup-posed to be a preservative against witchcraft. In Masuren, a district of Eastern Prussia inhab-ited by a branch of the Polish family, it is the custom on the evening of Midsummer Day to putout all the fires in the village. Then an oaken stake is driven into the ground and a wheel isfixed on it as on an axle. This wheel the villagers, working by relays, cause to revolve withgreat rapidity till fire is produced by friction. Every one takes home a lighted brand from thenew fire and with it rekindles the fire on the domestic hearth. In Serbia on Midsummer Eveherdsmen light torches of birch bark and march round the sheepfolds and cattle-stalls; thenthey climb the hills and there allow the torches to burn out.Among the Magyars in Hungary the midsummer fire-festival is marked by the same featuresthat meet us in so many parts of Europe. On Midsummer Eve in many places it is customaryto kindle bonfires on heights and to leap over them, and from the manner in which the youngpeople leap the bystanders predict whether they will marry soon. On this day also manyHungarian swineherds make fire by rotating a wheel round a wooden axle wrapt in hemp, andthrough the fire thus made they drive their pigs to preserve them from sickness.The Esthonians of Russia, who, like the Magyars, belong to the great Turanian family ofmankind, also celebrate the summer solstice in the usual way. They think that the St. John’sfire keeps witches from the cattle, and they say that he who does not come to it will have hisbarley full of thistles and his oats full of weeds. In the Esthonian island of Oesel, while theythrow fuel into the midsummer fire, they call out, “Weeds to the fire, flax to the field,” or theyfling three billets into the flames, saying, “Flax grow long!” And they take charred sticks fromthe bonfire home with them and keep them to make the cattle thrive. In some parts of theisland the bonfire is formed by piling brushwood and other combustibles round a tree, at thetop of which a flag flies. Whoever succeeds in knocking down the flag with a pole before itbegins to burn will have good luck. Formerly the festivities lasted till daybreak, and ended inscenes of debauchery which looked doubly hideous by the growing light of a summer morn-ing.Page 482"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"When we pass from the east to the west of Europe we still find the summer solstice celebrat-ed with rites of the same general character. Down to about the middle of the nineteenth cen-tury the custom of lighting bonfires at midsummer prevailed so commonly in France that therewas hardly a town or a village, we are told, where they were not kindled. People dancedround and leaped over them, and took charred sticks from the bonfire home with them to pro-tect the houses against lightning, conflagrations, and spells.In Brittany, apparently, the custom of the midsummer bonfires is kept up to this day. When theflames have died down, the whole assembly kneels round about the bonfire and an old manprays aloud. Then they all rise and march thrice round the fire; at the third turn they stop andevery one picks up a pebble and throws it on the burning pile. After that they disperse. InBrittany and Berry it is believed that a girl who dances round nine midsummer bonfires willmarry within the year. In the valley of the Orne the custom was to kindle the bonfire just at themoment when the sun was about to dip below the horizon; and the peasants drove their cat-tle through the fires to protect them against witchcraft, especially against the spells of witchesand wizards who attempted to steal the milk and butter. At Jumièges in Normandy, down tothe first half of the nineteenth century, the midsummer festival was marked by certain singularfeatures which bore the stamp of a very high antiquity. Every year, on the twenty-third ofJune, the Eve of St. John, the Brotherhood of the Green Wolf chose a new chief or master,who had always to be taken from the hamlet of Conihout. On being elected, the new head ofthe brotherhood assumed the title of the Green Wolf, and donned a peculiar costume consist-ing of a long green mantle and a very tall green hat of a conical shape and without a brim.Thus arrayed he stalked solemnly at the head of the brothers, chanting the hymn of St. John,the crucifix and holy banner leading the way, to a place called Chouquet. Here the processionwas met by the priest, precentors, and choir, who conducted the brotherhood to the parishchurch. After hearing mass the company adjourned to the house of the Green Wolf, where asimple repast was served up to them. At night a bonfire was kindled to the sound of hand-bells by a young man and a young woman, both decked with flowers. Then the Green Wolfand his brothers, with their hoods down on their shoulders and holding each other by thehand, ran round the fire after the man who had been chosen to be the Green Wolf of the fol-lowing year. Though only the first and the last man of the chain had a hand free, their busi-ness was to surround and seize thrice the future Green Wolf, who in his efforts to escapebelaboured the brothers with a long wand which he carried. When at last they succeeded incatching him they carried him to the burning pile and made as if they would throw him on it.This ceremony over, they returned to the house of the Green Wolf, where a supper, still of themost meagre fare, was set before them. Up till midnight a sort of religious solemnity pre-vailed. But at the stroke of twelve all this was changed. Constraint gave way to license; pioushymns were replaced by Bacchanalian ditties, and the shrill quavering notes of the village fid-dle hardly rose above the roar of voices that went up from the merry brotherhood of theGreen Wolf. Next day, the twenty-fourth of June or Midsummer Day, was celebrated by thesame personages with the same noisy gaiety. One of the ceremonies consisted in parading,to the sound of musketry, an enormous loaf of consecrated bread, which, rising in tiers, wassurmounted by a pyramid of verdure adorned with ribbons. After that the holy hand-bells,deposited on the step of the altar, were entrusted as insignia of office to the man who was tobe the Green Wolf next year.At Château-Thierry, in the department of Aisne, the custom of lighting bonfires and dancinground them at the midsummer festival of St. John lasted down to about 1850; the fires werekindled especially when June had been rainy, and the people thought that the lighting of thePage 483"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"bonfires would cause the rain to cease. In the Vosges it is still customary to kindle bonfiresupon the hill-tops on Midsummer Eve; the people believe that the fires help to preserve thefruits of the earth and ensure good crops.Bonfires were lit in almost all the hamlets of Poitou on the Eve of St. John. People marchedround them thrice, carrying a branch of walnut in their hand. Shepherdesses and childrenpassed sprigs of mullein (verbascum) and nuts across the flames; the nuts were supposed tocure toothache, and the mullein to protect the cattle from sickness and sorcery. When the firedied down people took some of the ashes home with them, either to keep them in the houseas a preservative against thunder or to scatter them on the fields for the purpose of destroy-ing corn-cockles and darnel. In Poitou also it used to be customary on the Eve of St. John totrundle a blazing wheel wrapt in straw over the fields to fertilise them.In the mountainous part of Comminges, a province of Southern France, the midsummer fire ismade by splitting open the trunk of a tall tree, stuffing the crevice with shavings, and ignitingthe whole. A garland of flowers is fastened to the top of the tree, and at the moment when thefire is lighted the man who was last married has to climb up a ladder and bring the flowersdown. In the flat parts of the same district the materials of the midsummer bonfires consist offuel piled in the usual way; but they must be put together by men who have been marriedsince the last midsummer festival, and each of these benedicts is obliged to lay a wreath offlowers on the top of the pile.In Provence the midsummer fires are still popular. Children go from door to door begging forfuel, and they are seldom sent empty away. Formerly the priest, the mayor, and the aldermenused to walk in procession to the bonfire, and even deigned to light it; after which the assem-bly marched thrice round the burning pile. At Aix a nominal king, chosen from among theyouth for his skill in shooting at a popinjay, presided over the midsummer festival. He selectedhis own officers, and escorted by a brilliant train marched to the bonfire, kindled it, and wasthe first to dance round it. Next day he distributed largesse to his followers. His reign lasted ayear, during which he enjoyed certain privileges. He was allowed to attend the mass celebrat-ed by the commander of the Knights of St. John on St. John’s Day; the right of hunting wasaccorded to him, and soldiers might not be quartered in his house. At Marseilles also on thisday one of the guilds chose a king of the badache or double axe; but it does not appear thathe kindled the bonfire, which is said to have been lighted with great ceremony by the préfetand other authorities.In Belgium the custom of kindling the midsummer bonfires has long disappeared from thegreat cities, but it is still kept up in rural districts and small towns. In that country the Eve ofSt. Peter’s Day (the twenty-ninth of June) is celebrated by bonfires and dances exactly likethose which commemorate St. John’s Eve. Some people say that the fires of St. Peter, likethose of St. John, are lighted in order to drive away dragons. In French Flanders down to1789 a straw figure representing a man was always burned in the midsummer bonfire, andthe figure of a woman was burned on St. Peter’s Day, the twenty-ninth of June. In Belgiumpeople jump over the midsummer bonfires as a preventive of colic, and they keep the ashesat home to hinder fire from breaking out.The custom of lighting bonfires at midsummer has been observed in many parts of our owncountry, and as usual people danced round and leaped over them. In Wales three or nine dif-ferent kinds of wood and charred faggots carefully preserved from the last midsummer weredeemed necessary to build the bonfire, which was generally done on rising ground. In thePage 484"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"Vale of Glamorgan a cart-wheel swathed in straw used to be ignited and sent rolling down thehill. If it kept alight all the way down and blazed for a long time, an abundant harvest wasexpected. On Midsummer Eve people in the Isle of Man were wont to light fires to the wind-ward of every field, so that the smoke might pass over the corn; and they folded their cattleand carried blazing furze or gorse round them several times. In Ireland cattle, especially bar-ren cattle, were driven through the midsummer fires, and the ashes were thrown on the fieldsto fertilise them, or live coals were carried into them to prevent blight. In Scotland the tracesof midsummer fires are few; but at that season in the highlands of Perthshire cowherds usedto go round their folds thrice, in the direction of the sun, with lighted torches. This they did topurify the flocks and herds and to keep them from falling sick.The practice of lighting bonfires on Midsummer Eve and dancing or leaping over them is, orwas till recently, common all over Spain and in some parts of Italy and Sicily. In Malta greatfires are kindled in the streets and squares of the towns and villages on the Eve of St. John(Midsummer Eve); formerly the Grand Master of the Order of St. John used on that eveningto set fire to a heap of pitch barrels placed in front of the sacred Hospital. In Greece, too, thecustom of kindling fires on St. John’s Eve and jumping over them is said to be still universal.One reason assigned for it is a wish to escape from the fleas. According to another account,the women cry out, as they leap over the fire, “I leave my sins behind me.” In Lesbos the fireson St. John’s Eve are usually lighted by threes, and the people spring thrice over them, eachwith a stone on his head, saying, “I jump the hare’s fire, my head a stone!” In Calymnos themidsummer fire is supposed to ensure abundance in the coming year as well as deliverancefrom fleas. The people dance round the fires singing, with stones on their heads, and thenjump over the blaze or the glowing embers. When the fire is burning low, they throw thestones into it; and when it is nearly out, they make crosses on their legs and then go straight-way and bathe in the sea.The custom of kindling bonfires on Midsummer Day or on Midsummer Eve is widely spreadamong the Mohammedan peoples of North Africa, particularly in Morocco and Algeria; it iscommon both to the Berbers and to many of the Arabs or Arabic-speaking tribes. In thesecountries Midsummer Day (the twenty-fourth of June, Old Style) is called l’ánsara. The firesare lit in the courtyards, at cross-roads, in the fields, and sometimes on the threshing-floors.Plants which in burning give out a thick smoke and an aromatic smell are much sought afterfor fuel on these occasions; among the plants used for the purpose are giant-fennel, thyme,rue, chervil-seed, camomile, geranium, and penny-royal. People expose themselves, andespecially their children, to the smoke, and drive it towards the orchards and the crops. Alsothey leap across the fires; in some places everybody ought to repeat the leap seven times.Moreover they take burning brands from the fires and carry them through the houses in orderto fumigate them. They pass things through the fire, and bring the sick into contact with it,while they utter prayers for their recovery. The ashes of the bonfires are also reputed to pos-sess beneficial properties; hence in some places people rub their hair or their bodies withthem. In some places they think that by leaping over the fires they rid themselves of all mis-fortune, and that childless couples thereby obtain offspring. Berbers of the Rif province, inNorthern Morocco, make great use of fires at midsummer for the good of themselves, theircattle, and their fruit-trees. They jump over the bonfires in the belief that this will preservethem in good health, and they light fires under fruit-trees to keep the fruit from falling untimely.And they imagine that by rubbing a paste of the ashes on their hair they prevent the hair fromfalling off their heads. In all these Moroccan customs, we are told, the beneficial effect isattributed wholly to the smoke, which is supposed to be endued with a magical quality thatremoves misfortune from men, animals, fruit-trees and crops.Page 485"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"The celebration of a midsummer festival by Mohammedan peoples is particularly remarkable,because the Mohammedan calendar, being purely lunar and uncorrected by intercalation,necessarily takes no note of festivals which occupy fixed points in the solar year; all strictlyMohammedan feasts, being pinned to the moon, slide gradually with that luminary throughthe whole period of the earth’s revolution about the sun. This fact of itself seems to prove thatamong the Mohammedan peoples of Northern Africa, as among the Christian peoples ofEurope, the midsummer festival is quite independent of the religion which the people publiclyprofess, and is a relic of a far older paganism.6. THE HALLOWE’EN FIRESFrom the foregoing survey we may infer that among the heathen forefathers of the Europeanpeoples the most popular and widespread fire-festival of the year was the great celebration ofMidsummer Eve or Midsummer Day. The coincidence of the festival with the summer solsticecan hardly be accidental. Rather we must suppose that our pagan ancestors purposely timedthe ceremony of fire on earth to coincide with the arrival of the sun at the highest point of hiscourse in the sky. If that was so, it follows that the old founders of the midsummer rites hadobserved the solstices or turning-points of the sun’s apparent path in the sky, and that theyaccordingly regulated their festal calendar to some extent by astronomical considerations.But while this may be regarded as fairly certain for what we may call the aborigines through-out a large part of the continent, it appears not to have been true of the Celtic peoples whoinhabited the Land’s End of Europe, the islands and promontories that stretch out into theAtlantic Ocean on the North-West. The principal fire-festivals of the Celts, which have sur-vived, though in a restricted area and with diminished pomp, to modern times and even to ourown day, were seemingly timed without any reference to the position of the sun in the heav-en. They were two in number, and fell at an interval of six months, one being celebrated onthe eve of May Day and the other on Allhallow Even or Hallowe’en, as it is now commonlycalled, that is, on the thirty-first of October, the day preceding All Saints’ or Allhallows’ Day.These dates coincide with none of the four great hinges on which the solar year revolves, towit, the solstices and the equinoxes. Nor do they agree with the principal seasons of the agri-cultural year, the sowing in spring and the reaping in autumn. For when May Day comes, theseed has long been committed to the earth; and when November opens, the harvest has longbeen reaped and garnered, the fields lie bare, the fruit-trees are stripped, and even the yellowleaves are fast fluttering to the ground. Yet the first of May and the first of November markturning-points of the year in Europe; the one ushers in the genial heat and the rich vegetationof summer, the other heralds, if it does not share, the cold and barrenness of winter. Nowthese particular points of the year, as has been well pointed out by a learned and ingeniouswriter, while they are of comparatively little moment to the European husbandman, do deeplyconcern the European herdsman; for it is on the approach of summer that he drives his cattleout into the open to crop the fresh grass, and it is on the approach of winter that he leadsthem back to the safety and shelter of the stall. Accordingly it seems not improbable that theCeltic bisection of the year into two halves at the beginning of May and the beginning ofNovember dates from a time when the Celts were mainly a pastoral people, dependent fortheir subsistence on their herds, and when accordingly the great epochs of the year for themwere the days on which the cattle went forth from the homestead in early summer andreturned to it again in early winter. Even in Central Europe, remote from the region now occu-pied by the Celts, a similar bisection of the year may be clearly traced in the great popularity,on the one hand, of May Day and its Eve (Walpurgis Night), and, on the other hand, of thePage 486"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"Feast of All Souls at the beginning of November, which under a thin Christian cloak concealsan ancient pagan festival of the dead. Hence we may conjecture that everywhere throughoutEurope the celestial division of the year according to the solstices was preceded by what wemay call a terrestrial division of the year according to the beginning of summer and the begin-ning of winter.Be that as it may, the two great Celtic festivals of May Day and the first of November or, to bemore accurate, the Eves of these two days, closely resemble each other in the manner oftheir celebration and in the superstitions associated with them, and alike, by the antique char-acter impressed upon both, betray a remote and purely pagan origin. The festival of May Dayor Beltane, as the Celts called it, which ushered in summer, has already been described; itremains to give some account of the corresponding festival of Hallowe’en, which announcedthe arrival of winter.Of the two feasts Hallowe’en was perhaps of old the more important, since the Celts wouldseem to have dated the beginning of the year from it rather than from Beltane. In the Isle ofMan, one of the fortresses in which the Celtic language and lore longest held out against thesiege of the Saxon invaders, the first of November, Old Style, has been regarded as NewYear’s day down to recent times. Thus Manx mummers used to go round on Hallowe’en (OldStyle), singing, in the Manx language, a sort of Hogmanay song which began “To-night isNew Year’s Night, Hogunnaa!” In ancient Ireland, a new fire used to be kindled every year onHallowe’en or the Eve of Samhain, and from this sacred flame all the fires in Ireland wererekindled. Such a custom points strongly to Samhain or All Saints’ Day (the first of November)as New Year’s Day; since the annual kindling of a new fire takes place most naturally at thebeginning of the year, in order that the blessed influence of the fresh fire may last throughoutthe whole period of twelve months. Another confirmation of the view that the Celts dated theiryear from the first of November is furnished by the manifold modes of divination which werecommonly resorted to by Celtic peoples on Hallowe’en for the purpose of ascertaining theirdestiny, especially their fortune in the coming year; for when could these devices for pryinginto the future be more reasonably put in practice than at the beginning of the year? As aseason of omens and auguries Hallowe’en seems to have far surpassed Beltane in the imagi-nation of the Celts; from which we may with some probability infer that they reckoned theiryear from Hallowe’en rather than Beltane. Another circumstance of great moment whichpoints to the same conclusion is the association of the dead with Hallowe’en. Not only amongthe Celts but throughout Europe, Hallowe’en, the night which marks the transition fromautumn to winter, seems to have been of old the time of year when the souls of the departedwere supposed to revisit their old homes in order to warm themselves by the fire and to com-fort themselves with the good cheer provided for them in the kitchen or the parlour by theiraffectionate kinsfolk. It was, perhaps, a natural thought that the approach of winter shoulddrive the poor shivering hungry ghosts from the bare fields and the leafless woodlands to theshelter of the cottage with its familiar fireside. Did not the lowing kine then troop back fromthe summer pastures in the forests and on the hills to be fed and cared for in the stalls, whilethe bleak winds whistled among the swaying boughs and the snow-drifts deepened in the hol-lows? and could the good-man and the good-wife deny to the spirits of their dead the wel-come which they gave to the cows?But it is not only the souls of the departed who are supposed to be hovering unseen on theday “when autumn to winter resigns the pale year.” Witches then speed on their errands ofmischief, some sweeping through the air on besoms, others galloping along the roads ontabby-cats, which for that evening are turned into coal-black steeds. The fairies, too, are all letPage 487"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"loose, and hobgoblins of every sort roam freely about.Yet while a glamour of mystery and awe has always clung to Hallowe’en in the minds of theCeltic peasantry, the popular celebration of the festival has been, at least in modern times, byno means of a prevailing gloomy cast; on the contrary it has been attended by picturesquefeatures and merry pastimes, which rendered it the gayest night of all the year. Amongst thethings which in the Highlands of Scotland contributed to invest the festival with a romanticbeauty were the bonfires which used to blaze at frequent intervals on the heights. “On the lastday of autumn children gathered ferns, tar-barrels, the long thin stalks called gàinisg, andeverything suitable for a bonfire. These were placed in a heap on some eminence near thehouse, and in the evening set fire to. The fires were called Samhnagan. There was one foreach house, and it was an object of ambition who should have the biggest. Whole districtswere brilliant with bonfires, and their glare across a Highland loch, and from many emi-nences, formed an exceedingly picturesque scene.” Like the Beltane fires on the first of May,the Hallowe’en bonfires seem to have been kindled most commonly in the PerthshireHighlands. In the parish of Callander they still blazed down to near the end of the eighteenthcentury. When the fire had died down, the ashes were carefully collected in the form of a cir-cle, and a stone was put in, near the circumference, for every person of the several familiesinterested in the bonfire. Next morning, if any of these stones was found to be displaced orinjured, the people made sure that the person represented by it was fey or devoted, and thathe could not live twelve months from that day. At Balquhidder down to the latter part of thenineteenth century each household kindled its bonfire at Hallowe’en, but the custom waschiefly observed by children. The fires were lighted on any high knoll near the house; therewas no dancing round them. Hallowe’en fires were also lighted in some districts of the north-east of Scotland, such as Buchan. Villagers and farmers alike must have their fire. In the vil-lages the boys went from house to house and begged a peat from each householder, usuallywith the words, “Ge’s a peat t’ burn the witches.” When they had collected enough peats, theypiled them in a heap, together with straw, furze, and other combustible materials, and set thewhole on fire. Then each of the youths, one after another, laid himself down on the ground asnear to the fire as he could without being scorched, and thus lying allowed the smoke to rollover him. The others ran through the smoke and jumped over their prostrate comrade. Whenthe heap was burned down, they scattered the ashes, vying with each other who should scat-ter them most.In the northern part of Wales it used to be customary for every family to make a great bonfirecalled Coel Coeth on Hallowe’en. The fire was kindled on the most conspicuous spot near thehouse; and when it had nearly gone out every one threw into the ashes a white stone, whichhe had first marked. Then having said their prayers round the fire, they went to bed. Nextmorning, as soon as they were up, they came to search out the stones, and if any one ofthem was found to be missing, they had a notion that the person who threw it would diebefore he saw another Hallowe’en. According to Sir John Rhys, the habit of celebratingHallowe’en by lighting bonfires on the hills is perhaps not yet extinct in Wales, and men stillliving can remember how the people who assisted at the bonfires would wait till the last sparkwas out and then would suddenly take to their heels, shouting at the top of their voices, “Thecropped black sow seize the hindmost!” The saying, as Sir John Rhys justly remarks, impliesthat originally one of the company became a victim in dead earnest. Down to the present timethe saying is current in Carnarvonshire, where allusions to the cutty black sow are still occa-sionally made to frighten children. We can now understand why in Lower Brittany every per-son throws a pebble into the midsummer bonfire. Doubtless there, as in Wales and theHighlands of Scotland, omens of life and death have at one time or other been drawn fromPage 488"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"the position and state of the pebbles on the morning of All Saints’ Day. The custom, thusfound among three separate branches of the Celtic stock, probably dates from a periodbefore their dispersion, or at least from a time when alien races had not yet driven home thewedges of separation between them.In the Isle of Man also, another Celtic country, Hallowe’en was celebrated down to moderntimes by the kindling of fires, accompanied with all the usual ceremonies designed to preventthe baneful influence of fairies and witches.7. THE MIDWINTER FIRESIf the heathen of ancient Europe celebrated, as we have good reason to believe, the seasonof Midsummer with a great festival of fire, of which the traces have survived in many placesdown to our own time, it is natural to suppose that they should have observed with similarrites the corresponding season of Midwinter; for Midsummer and Midwinter, or, in more tech-nical language, the summer solstice and the winter solstice, are the two great turningpoints inthe sun’s apparent course through the sky, and from the standpoint of primitive man nothingmight seem more appropriate than to kindle fires on earth at the two moments when the fireand heat of the great luminary in heaven begin to wane or to wax.In modern Christendom the ancient fire-festival of the winter solstice appears to survive, or tohave survived down to recent years, in the old custom of the Yule log, clog, or block, as itwas variously called in England. The custom was widespread in Europe, but seems to haveflourished especially in England, France, and among the South Slavs; at least the fullestaccounts of the custom come from these quarters. That the Yule log was only the wintercounterpart of the midsummer bonfire, kindled within doors instead of in the open air onaccount of the cold and inclement weather of the season, was pointed out long ago by ourEnglish antiquary John Brand; and the view is supported by the many quaint superstitionsattaching to the Yule log, superstitions which have no apparent connexion with Christianitybut carry their heathen origin plainly stamped upon them. But while the two solstitial celebra-tions were both festivals of fire, the necessity or desirability of holding the winter celebrationwithin doors lent it the character of a private or domestic festivity, which contrasts stronglywith the publicity of the summer celebration, at which the people gathered on some openspace or conspicuous height, kindled a huge bonfire in common, and danced and mademerry round it together.Down to about the middle of the nineteenth century the old rite of the Yule log was kept up insome parts of Central Germany. Thus in the valleys of the Sieg and Lahn the Yule log, aheavy block of oak, was fitted into the floor of the hearth, where, though it glowed under thefire, it was hardly reduced to ashes within a year. When the new log was laid next year, theremains of the old one were ground to powder and strewed over the fields during the TwelveNights, which was supposed to promote the growth of the crops. In some villages ofWestphalia, the practice was to withdraw the Yule log (Christbrand) from the fire so soon as itwas slightly charred; it was then kept carefully to be replaced on the fire whenever a thunder-storm broke, because the people believed that lightning would not strike a house in which theYule log was smouldering. In other villages of Westphalia the old custom was to tie up theYule log in the last sheaf cut at harvest.In several provinces of France, and particularly in Provence, the custom of the Yule log or tré-foir, as it was called in many places, was long observed. A French writer of the seventeenthPage 489"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"century denounces as superstitious “the belief that a log called the tréfoir or Christmas brand,which you put on the fire for the first time on Christmas Eve and continue to put on the fire fora little while every day till Twelfth Night, can, if kept under the bed, protect the house for awhole year from fire and thunder; that it can prevent the inmates from having chilblains ontheir heels in winter; that it can cure the cattle of many maladies; that if a piece of it besteeped in the water which cows drink it helps them to calve; and lastly that if the ashes ofthe log be strewn on the fields it can save the wheat from mildew.”In some parts of Flanders and France the remains of the Yule log were regularly kept in thehouse under a bed as a protection against thunder and lightning; in Berry, when thunder washeard, a member of the family used to take a piece of the log and throw it on the fire, whichwas believed to avert the lightning. Again, in Perigord, the charcoal and ashes are carefullycollected and kept for healing swollen glands; the part of the trunk which has not been burntin the fire is used by ploughmen to make the wedge for their plough, because they allege thatit causes the seeds to thrive better; and the women keep pieces of it till Twelfth Night for thesake of their chickens. Some people imagine that they will have as many chickens as thereare sparks that fly out of the brands of the log when they shake them; and others place theextinct brands under the bed to drive away vermin. In various parts of France the charred logis thought to guard the house against sorcery as well as against lightning.In England the customs and beliefs concerning the Yule log used to be similar. On the nightof Christmas Eve, says the antiquary John Brand, “our ancestors were wont to light up can-dles of an uncommon size, called Christmas Candles, and lay a log of wood upon the fire,called a Yule-clog or Christmas-block, to illuminate the house, and, as it were, to turn nightinto day.” The old custom was to light the Yule log with a fragment of its predecessor, whichhad been kept throughout the year for the purpose; where it was so kept, the fiend could dono mischief. The remains of the log were also supposed to guard the house against fire andlightning.To this day the ritual of bringing in the Yule log is observed with much solemnity among theSouthern Slavs, especially the Serbians. The log is usually a block of oak, but sometimes ofolive or beech. They seem to think that they will have as many calves, lambs, pigs, and kidsas they strike sparks out of the burning log. Some people carry a piece of the log out to thefields to protect them against hail. In Albania down to recent years it was a common customto burn a Yule log at Christmas, and the ashes of the fire were scattered on the fields to makethem fertile. The Huzuls, a Slavonic people of the Carpathians, kindle fire by the friction ofwood on Christmas Eve (Old Style, the fifth of January) and keep it burning till Twelfth Night.It is remarkable how common the belief appears to have been that the remains of the Yulelog, if kept throughout the year, had power to protect the house against fire and especiallyagainst lightning. As the Yule log was frequently of oak, it seems possible that this belief maybe a relic of the old Aryan creed which associated the oak-tree with the god of thunder.Whether the curative and fertilising virtues ascribed to the ashes of the Yule log, which aresupposed to heal cattle as well as men, to enable cows to calve, and to promote the fruitful-ness of the earth, may not be derived from the same ancient source, is a question whichdeserves to be considered.8. THE NEED-FIREThe fire-festivals hitherto described are all celebrated periodically at certain stated times ofPage 490"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"the year. But besides these regularly recurring celebrations the peasants in many parts ofEurope have been wont from time immemorial to resort to a ritual of fire at irregular intervalsin seasons of distress and calamity, above all when their cattle were attacked by epidemicdisease. No account of the popular European fire-festivals would be complete without somenotice of these remarkable rites, which have all the greater claim on our attention becausethey may perhaps be regarded as the source and origin of all the other fire-festivals; certainlythey must date from a very remote antiquity. The general name by which they are knownamong the Teutonic peoples is need-fire. Sometimes the need-fire was known as “wild fire,” todistinguish it no doubt from the tame fire produced by more ordinary methods. AmongSlavonic peoples it is called “living fire.”The history of the custom can be traced from the early Middle Ages, when it was denouncedby the Church as a heathen superstition, down to the first half of the nineteenth century, whenit was still occasionally practised in various parts of Germany, England, Scotland, and Ireland.Among Slavonic peoples it appears to have lingered even longer. The usual occasion for per-forming the rite was an outbreak of plague or cattle-disease, for which the need-fire wasbelieved to be an infallible remedy. The animals which were subjected to it included cows,pigs, horses, and sometimes geese. As a necessary preliminary to the kindling of the need-fire all other fires and lights in the neighbourhood were extinguished, so that not so much asa spark remained alight; for so long as even a night-light burned in a house, it was imaginedthat the need-fire could not kindle. Sometimes it was deemed enough to put out all the fires inthe village; but sometimes the extinction extended to neighbouring villages or to a wholeparish. In some parts of the Highlands of Scotland the rule was that all householders whodwelt within the two nearest running streams should putout their lights and fires on the day appointed. Usually the need-fire was made in the open air,but in some parts of Serbia it was kindled in a dark room; sometimes the place was a cross-way or a hollow in a road. In the Highlands of Scotland the proper places for performing therite seem to have been knolls or small islands in rivers.The regular method of producing the need-fire was by the friction of two pieces of wood; itmight not be struck by flint and steel. Very exceptionally among some South Slavs we read ofa practice of kindling a need-fire by striking a piece of iron on an anvil. Where the wood to beemployed is specified, it is generally said to be oak; but on the Lower Rhine the fire was kin-dled by the friction of oak-wood or fir-wood. In Slavonic countries we hear of poplar, pear, andcornel wood being used for the purpose. Often the material is simply described as two piecesof dry wood. Sometimes nine different kinds of wood were deemed necessary, but rather per-haps to be burned in the bonfire than to be rubbed together for the production of the need-fire. The particular mode of kindling the need-fire varied in different districts; a very commonone was this. Two poles were driven into the ground about a foot and a half from each other.Each pole had in the side facing the other a socket into which a smooth cross-piece or rollerwas fitted. The sockets were stuffed with linen, and the two ends of the roller were rammedtightly into the sockets. To make it more inflammable the roller was often coated with tar. Arope was then wound round the roller, and the free ends at both sides were gripped by two ormore persons, who by pulling the rope to and fro caused the roller to revolve rapidly, tillthrough the friction the linen in the sockets took fire. The sparks were immediately caught intow or oakum and waved about in a circle until they burst into a bright glow, when straw wasapplied to it, and the blazing straw used to kindle the fuel that had been stacked to make thebonfire. Often a wheel, sometimes a cart-wheel or even a spinning-wheel, formed part of themechanism; in Aberdeenshire it was called “the muckle wheel”; in the island of Mull the wheelwas turned from east to west over nine spindles of oak-wood. Sometimes we are merely toldPage 491"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"that two wooden planks were rubbed together. Sometimes it was prescribed that the cart-wheel used for fire-making and the axle on which it turned should both be new. Similarly itwas said that the rope which turned the roller should be new; if possible it should be woven ofstrands taken from a gallows rope with which people had been hanged, but this was a coun-sel of perfection rather than a strict necessity.Various rules were also laid down as to the kind of persons who might or should make theneed-fire. Sometimes it was said that the two persons who pulled the rope which twirled theroller should always be brothers or at least bear the same baptismal name; sometimes it wasdeemed sufficient if they were both chaste young men. In some villages of Brunswick peoplethought that if everybody who lent a hand in kindling the need-fire did not bear the sameChristian name, they would labour in vain. In Silesia the tree employed to produce the need-fire used to be felled by a pair of twin brothers. In the western islands of Scotland the fire waskindled by eighty-one married men, who rubbed two great planks against each other, workingin relays of nine; in North Uist the nine times nine who made the fire were all first-begottensons, but we are not told whether they were married or single. Among the Serbians the need-fire is sometimes kindled by a boy and girl between eleven and fourteen years of age, whowork stark naked in a dark room; sometimes it is made by an old man and an old woman alsoin the dark. In Bulgaria, too, the makers of need-fire strip themselves of their clothes; inCaithness they divested themselves of all kinds of metal. If after long rubbing of the wood nofire was elicited they concluded that some fire must still be burning in the village; so a strictsearch was made from house to house, any fire that might be found was put out, and thenegligent householder punished or upbraided; indeed a heavy fine might be inflicted on him.When the need-fire was at last kindled, the bonfire was lit from it, and as soon as the blazehad somewhat died down, the sick animals were driven over the glowing embers, sometimesin a regular order of precedence, first the pigs, next the cows, and last of all the horses.Sometimes they were driven twice or thrice through the smoke and flames, so that occasion-ally some of them were scorched to death. As soon as all the beasts were through, the youngfolk would rush wildly at the ashes and cinders, sprinkling and blackening each other withthem; those who were most blackened would march in triumph behind the cattle into the vil-lage and would not wash themselves for a long time. From the bonfire people carried liveembers home and used them to rekindle the fires in their houses. These brands, after beingextinguished in water, they sometimes put in the managers at which the cattle fed, and keptthem there for a while. Ashes from the need-fire were also strewed on the fields to protect thecrops against vermin; sometimes they were taken home to be employed as remedies in sick-ness, being sprinkled on the ailing part or mixed in water and drunk by the patient. In thewestern islands of Scotland and on the adjoining mainland, as soon as the fire on the domes-tic hearth had been rekindled from the need-fire a pot full of water was set on it, and thewater thus heated was afterwards sprinkled upon the people infected with the plague or uponthe cattle that were tainted by the murrain. Special virtue was attributed to the smoke of thebonfire; in Sweden fruit-trees and nets were fumigated with it, in order that the trees mightbear fruit and the nets catch fish. In the Highlands of Scotland the need-fire was accounted asovereign remedy for witchcraft. In the island of Mull, when the fire was kindled as a cure forthe murrain, we hear of the rite being accompanied by the sacrifice of a sick heifer, which wascut in pieces and burnt. Slavonian and Bulgarian peasants conceive cattle-plague as a foulfiend or vampyre which can be kept at bay by interposing a barrier of fire between it and theherds. A similar conception may perhaps have originally everywhere underlain the use of theneed-fire as a remedy for the murrain. It appears that in some parts of Germany the peopledid not wait for an outbreak of cattleplague, but, taking time by the forelock, kindled a need-Page 492"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"fire annually to prevent the calamity. Similarly in Poland the peasants are said to kindle firesin the village streets every year on St. Rochus’s day and to drive the cattle thrice throughthem in order to protect the beasts against the murrain. We have seen that in the Hebridesthe cattle were in like manner driven annually round the Beltane fires for the same purpose.In some cantons of Switzerland children still kindle a need-fire by the friction of wood for thesake of dispelling a mist.Chapter LXIIIThe Interpretation of the Fire-Festivals1. ON THE FIRE-FESTIVALS IN GENERALTHE foregoing survey of the popular fire-festivals of Europe suggests some general observa-tions. In the first place we can hardly help being struck by the resemblance which the cere-monies bear to each other, at whatever time of the year and in whatever part of Europe theyare celebrated. The custom of kindling great bonfires, leaping over them, and driving cattlethrough or round them would seem to have been practically universal throughout Europe, andthe same may be said of the processions or races with blazing torches round fields, orchards,pastures, or cattle-stalls. Less widespread are the customs of hurling lighted discs into the airand trundling a burning wheel down hill. The ceremonial of the Yule log is distinguished fromthat of the other fire-festivals by the privacy and domesticity which characterise it; but this dis-tinction may well be due simply to the rough weather of midwinter, which is apt not only torender a public assembly in the open air disagreeable, but also at any moment to defeat theobject of the assembly by extinguishing the all-important fire under a downpour of rain or afall of snow. Apart from these local or seasonal differences, the general resemblance betweenthe fire-festivals at all times of the year and in all places is tolerably close. And as the cere-monies themselves resemble each other, so do the benefits which the people expect to reapfrom them. Whether applied in the form of bonfires blazing at fixed points, or of torches car-ried about from place to place, or of embers and ashes taken from the smouldering heap offuel, the fire is believed to promote the growth of the crops and the welfare of man and beast,either positively by stimulating them, or negatively by averting the dangers and calamitieswhich threaten them from such causes as thunder and lightning, conflagration, blight, mildew,vermin, sterility, disease, and not least of all witchcraft.But we naturally ask, How did it come about that benefits so great and manifold were sup-posed to be attained by means so simple? In what way did people imagine that they couldprocure so many goods or avoid so many ills by the application of fire and smoke, of embersand ashes? Two different explanations of the fire-festivals have been given by modern enquir-ers. On the one hand it has been held that they are sun-charms or magical ceremoniesintended, on the principle of imitative magic, to ensure a needful supply of sunshine for men,animals, and plants by kindling fires which mimic on earth the great source of light and heatin the sky. This was the view of Wilhelm Mannhardt. It may be called the solar theory. On theother hand it has been maintained that the ceremonial fires have no necessary reference tothe sun but are simply purificatory in intention, being designed to burn up and destroy allharmful influences, whether these are conceived in a personal form as witches, demons, andmonsters, or in an impersonal form as a sort of pervading taint or corruption of the air. This isthe view of Dr. Edward Westermarck and apparently of Professor Eugen Mogk. It may becalled the purificatory theory. Obviously the two theories postulate two very different concep-tions of the fire which plays the principal part in the rites. On the one view, the fire, like sun-shine in our latitude, is a genial creative power which fosters the growth of plants and thePage 493"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"development of all that makes for health and happiness; on the other view, the fire is a fiercedestructive power which blasts and consumes all the noxious elements, whether spiritual ormaterial, that menace the life of men, of animals, and of plants. According to the one theorythe fire is a stimulant, according to the other it is a disinfectant; on the one view its virtue ispositive, on the other it is negative.Yet the two explanations, different as they are in the character which they attribute to the fire,are perhaps not wholly irreconcilable. If we assume that the fires kindled at these festivalswere primarily intended to imitate the sun’s light and heat, may we not regard the purificatoryand disinfecting qualities, which popular opinion certainly appears to have ascribed to them,as attributes derived directly from the purificatory and disinfecting qualities of sunshine? Inthis way we might conclude that, while the imitation of sunshine in these ceremonies was pri-mary and original, the purification attributed to them was secondary and derivative. Such aconclusion, occupying an intermediate position between the two opposing theories and recog-nising an element of truth in both of them, was adopted by me in earlier editions of this work;but in the meantime Dr. Westermarck has argued powerfully in favour of the purificatory theo-ry alone, and I am bound to say that his arguments carry great weight, and that on a fullerreview of the facts the balance of evidence seems to me to incline decidedly in his favour.However, the case is not so clear as to justify us in dismissing the solar theory without discus-sion, and accordingly I propose to adduce the considerations which tell for it before proceed-ing to notice those which tell against it. A theory which had the support of so learned andsagacious an investigator as W. Mannhardt is entitled to a respectful hearing.2. THE SOLAR THEORY OF THE FIRE-FESTIVALSIn an earlier part of this work we saw that savages resort to charms for making sunshine, andit would be no wonder if primitive man in Europe did the same. Indeed, when we consider thecold and cloudy climate of Europe during a great part of the year, we shall find it natural thatsun-charms should have played a much more prominent part among the superstitious prac-tices of European peoples than among those of savages who live nearer the equator and whoconsequently are apt to get in the course of nature more sunshine than they want. This viewof the festivals may be supported by various arguments drawn partly from their dates, partlyfrom the nature of the rites, and partly from the influence which they are believed to exertupon the weather and on vegetation.First, in regard to the dates of the festivals it can be no mere accident that two of the mostimportant and widely spread of the festivals are timed to coincide more or less exactly withthe summer and winter solstices, that is, with the two turning-points in the sun’s apparentcourse in the sky when he reaches respectively his highest and his lowest elevation at noon.Indeed with respect to the midwinter celebration of Christmas we are not left to conjecture;we know from the express testimony of the ancients that it was instituted by the church tosupersede an old heathen festival of the birth of the sun, which was apparently conceived tobe born again on the shortest day of the year, after which his light and heat were seen togrow till they attained their full maturity at midsummer. Therefore it is no very far-fetched con-jecture to suppose that the Yule log, which figures so prominently in the popular celebration ofChristmas, was originally designed to help the labouring sun of midwinter to rekindle hisseemingly expiring light.Not only the date of some of the festivals but the manner of their celebration suggests a con-scious imitation of the sun. The custom of rolling a burning wheel down a hill, which is oftenPage 494"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"observed at these ceremonies, might well pass for an imitation of the sun’s course in the sky,and the imitation would be especially appropriate on Midsummer Day when the sun’s annualdeclension begins. Indeed the custom has been thus interpreted by some of those who haverecorded it. Not less graphic, it may be said, is the mimicry of his apparent revolution byswinging a burning tar-barrel round a pole. Again, the common practice of throwing fierydiscs, sometimes expressly said to be shaped like suns, into the air at the festivals may wellbe a piece of imitative magic. In these, as in so many cases, the magic force may be sup-posed to take effect through mimicry or sympathy: by imitating the desired result you actuallyproduce it: by counterfeiting the sun’s progress through the heavens you really help the lumi-nary to pursue his celestial journey with punctuality and despatch. The name “fire of heaven,”by which the midsummer fire is sometimes popularly known, clearly implies a consciousnessof a connexion between the earthly and the heavenly flame.Again, the manner in which the fire appears to have been originally kindled on these occa-sions has been alleged in support of the view that it was intended to be a mock-sun. As somescholars have perceived, it is highly probable that at the periodic festivals in former times firewas universally obtained by the friction of two pieces of wood. It is still so procured in someplaces both at the Easter and the Midsummer festivals, and it is expressly said to have beenformerly so procured at the Beltane celebration both in Scotland and Wales. But what makesit nearly certain that this was once the invariable mode of kindling the fire at these periodicfestivals is the analogy of the needfire, which has almost always been produced by the fric-tion of wood, and sometimes by the revolution of a wheel. It is a plausible conjecture that thewheel employed for this purpose represents the sun, and if the fires at the regularly recurringcelebrations were formerly produced in the same way, it might be regarded as a confirmationof the view that they were originally sun-charms. In point of fact there is, as Kuhn has indicat-ed, some evidence to show that the midsummer fire was originally thus produced. We haveseen that many Hungarian swine-herds make fire on Midsummer Eve by rotating a wheelround a wooden axle wrapt in hemp, and that they drive their pigs through the fire thus made.At Obermedlingen, in Swabia, the “fire of heaven,” as it was called, was made on St. Vitus’sDay (the fifteenth of June) by igniting a cart-wheel, which, smeared with pitch and plaited withstraw, was fastened on a pole twelve feet high, the top of the pole being inserted in the naveof the wheel. This fire was made on the summit of a mountain, and as the flame ascended,the people uttered a set form of words, with eyes and arms directed heavenward. Here thefixing of a wheel on a pole and igniting it suggests that originally the fire was produced, as inthe case of the need-fire, by the revolution of a wheel. The day on which the ceremony takesplace (the fifteenth of June) is near midsummer; and we have seen that in Masuren fire is, orused to be, actually made on Midsummer Day by turning a wheel rapidly about an oakenpole, though it is not said that the new fire so obtained is used to light a bonfire. However, wemust bear in mind that in all such cases the use of a wheel may be merely a mechanicaldevice to facilitate the operation of fire-making by increasing the friction; it need not have anysymbolical significance.Further, the influence which these fires, whether periodic or occasional, are supposed to exerton the weather and vegetation may be cited in support of the view that they are sun-charms,since the effects ascribed to them resemble those of sunshine. Thus, the French belief that ina rainy June the lighting of the midsummer bonfires will cause the rain to cease appears toassume that they can disperse the dark clouds and make the sun to break out in radiantglory, drying the wet earth and dripping trees. Similarly the use of the need-fire by Swiss chil-dren on foggy days for the purpose of clearing away the mist may very naturally be interpret-ed as a sun-charm. In the Vosges Mountains the people believe that the midsummer firesPage 495"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"help to preserve the fruits of the earth and ensure good crops. In Sweden the warmth or coldof the coming season is inferred from the direction in which the flames of the May Day bonfireare blown; if they blow to the south, it will be warm, if to the north, cold. No doubt at presentthe direction of the flames is regarded merely as an augury of the weather, not as a mode ofinfluencing it. But we may be pretty sure that this is one of the cases in which magic hasdwindled into divination. So in the Eifel Mountains, when the smoke blows towards the corn-fields, this is an omen that the harvest will be abundant. But the older view may have beennot merely that the smoke and flames prognosticated, but that they actually produced anabundant harvest, the heat of the flames acting like sunshine on the corn. Perhaps it was withthis view that people in the Isle of Man lit fires to windward of their fields in order that thesmoke might blow over them. So in South Africa, about the month of April, the Matabeles lighthuge fires to the windward of their gardens, “their idea being that the smoke, by passing overthe crops, will assist the ripening of them.” Among the Zulus also “medicine is burned on afire placed to windward of the garden, the fumigation which the plants in consequencereceive being held to improve the crop.” Again, the idea of our European peasants that thecorn will grow well as far as the blaze of the bonfire is visible, may be interpreted as a rem-nant of the belief in the quickening and fertilising power of the bonfires. The same belief, itmay be argued, reappears in the notion that embers taken from the bonfires and inserted inthe fields will promote the growth of the crops, and it may be thought to underlie the customsof sowing flax-seed in the direction in which the flames blow, of mixing the ashes of the bon-fire with the seed-corn at sowing, of scattering the ashes by themselves over the field to fer-tilise it, and of incorporating a piece of the Yule log in the plough to make the seeds thrive.The opinion that the flax or hemp will grow as high as the flames rise or the people leap overthem belongs clearly to the same class of ideas.Again, at Konz, on the banks of the Moselle, if the blazing wheel which was trundled downthe hillside reached the river without being extinguished, this was hailed as a proof that thevintage would be abundant. So firmly was this belief held that the successful performance ofthe ceremony entitled the villagers to levy a tax upon the owners of the neighbouring vine-yards. Here the unextinguished wheel might be taken to represent an unclouded sun, whichin turn would portend an abundant vintage. So the waggon-load of white wine which the vil-lagers received from the vineyards round about might pass for a payment for the sunshinewhich they had procured for the grapes. Similarly in the Vale of Glamorgan a blazing wheelused to be trundled down hill on Midsummer Day, and if the fire were extinguished before thewheel reached the foot of the hill, the people expected a bad harvest; whereas if the wheelkept alight all the way down and continued to blaze for a long time, the farmers looked for-ward to heavy crops that summer. Here, again, it is natural to suppose that the rustic mindtraced a direct connexion between the fire of the wheel and the fire of the sun, on which thecrops are dependent.But in popular belief the quickening and fertilising influence of the bonfires is not limited to thevegetable world; it extends also to animals. This plainly appears from the Irish custom of driv-ing barren cattle through the midsummer fires, from the French belief that the Yule logsteeped in water helps cows to calve, from the French and Serbian notion that there will beas many chickens, calves, lambs, and kids as there are sparks struck out of the Yule log,from the French custom of putting the ashes of the bonfires in the fowls’ nests to make thehens lay eggs, and from the German practice of mixing the ashes of the bonfires with thedrink of cattle in order to make the animals thrive. Further, there are clear indications thateven human fecundity is supposed to be promoted by the genial heat of the fires. In Moroccothe people think that childless couples can obtain offspring by leaping over the midsummerbonfire. It is an Irish belief that a girl who jumps thrice over the midsummer bonfire will soonPage 496"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"marry and become the mother of many children; in Flanders women leap over the midsum-mer fires to ensure an easy delivery; in various parts of France they think that if a girl dancesround nine fires she will be sure to marry within the year, and in Bohemia they fancy that shewill do so if she merely sees nine of the bonfires. On the other hand, in Lechrain people saythat if a young man and woman, leaping over the midsummer fire together, escapeunsmirched, the young woman will not become a mother within twelve months; the flameshave not touched and fertilised her. In parts of Switzerland and France the lighting of the Yulelog is accompanied by a prayer that the women may bear children, the she-goats bring forthkids, and the ewes drop lambs. The rule observed in some places that the bonfires should bekindled by the person who was last married seems to belong to the same class of ideas,whether it be that such a person is supposed to receive from, or to impart to, the fire a gener-ative and fertilising influence. The common practice of lovers leaping over the fires hand inhand may very well have originated in a notion that thereby their marriage would be blessedwith offspring; and the like motive would explain the custom which obliges couples marriedwithin the year to dance to the light of torches. And the scenes of profligacy which appear tohave marked the midsummer celebration among the Esthonians, as they once marked thecelebration of May Day among ourselves, may have sprung, not from the mere licence of hol-iday-makers, but from a crude notion that such orgies were justified, if not required, by somemysterious bond which linked the life of man to the courses of the heavens at this turning-point of the year.At the festivals which we are considering the custom of kindling bonfires is commonly associ-ated with a custom of carrying lighted torches about the fields, the orchards, the pastures, theflocks and the herds; and we can hardly doubt that the two customs are only two differentways of attaining the same object, namely, the benefits which are believed to flow from thefire, whether it be stationary or portable. Accordingly if we accept the solar theory of the bon-fires, we seem bound to apply it also to the torches; we must suppose that the practice ofmarching or running with blazing torches about the country is simply a means of diffusing farand wide the genial influence of the sunshine of which these flickering flames are a feebleimitation. In favour of this view it may be said that sometimes the torches are carried aboutthe fields for the express purpose of fertilising them, and with the same intention live coalsfrom the bonfires are sometimes placed in the fields to prevent blight. On the eve of TwelfthDay in Normandy men, women, and children run wildly through the fields and orchards withlighted torches, which they wave about the branches and dash against the trunks of the fruit-trees for the sake of burning the moss and driving away the moles and field-mice. “Theybelieve that the ceremony fulfills the double object of exorcising the vermin whose multiplica-tion would be a real calamity, and of imparting fecundity to the trees, the fields, and even thecattle”; and they imagine that the more the ceremony is prolonged, the greater will be thecrop of fruit next autumn. In Bohemia they say that the corn will grow as high as they fling theblazing besoms into the air. Nor are such notions confined to Europe. In Corea, a few daysbefore the New Year festival, the eunuchs of the palace swing burning torches, chanting invo-cations the while, and this is supposed to ensure bountiful crops for the next season. Thecustom of trundling a burning wheel over the fields, which used to be observed in Poitou forthe express purpose of fertilising them, may be thought to embody the same idea in a stillmore graphic form; since in this way the mock-sun itself, not merely its light and heat repre-sented by torches, is made actually to pass over the ground which is to receive its quickeningand kindly influence. Once more, the custom of carrying lighted brands round cattle is plainlyequivalent to driving the animals through the bonfire; and if the bonfire is a suncharm, thetorches must be so also.Page 497"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"3. THE PURIFICATORY THEORY OF THE FIRE-FESTIVALSThus far we have considered what may be said for the theory that at the European fire-festi-vals the fire is kindled as a charm to ensure an abundant supply of sunshine for man andbeast, for corn and fruits. It remains to consider what may be said against this theory and infavour of the view that in these rites fire is employed not as a creative but as a cleansingagent, which purifies men, animals, and plants by burning up and consuming the noxious ele-ments, whether material or spiritual, which menace all living things with disease and death.First, then, it is to be observed that the people who practise the fire-customs appear never toallege the solar theory in explanation of them, while on the contrary they do frequently andemphatically put forward the purificatory theory. This is a strong argument in favour of thepurificatory and against the solar theory; for the popular explanation of a popular custom isnever to be rejected except for grave cause. And in the present case there seems to be noadequate reason for rejecting it. The conception of fire as a destructive agent, which can beturned to account for the consumption of evil things, is so simple and obvious that it couldhardly escape the minds even of the rude peasantry with whom these festivals originated. Onthe other hand the conception of fire as an emanation of the sun, or at all events as linked toit by a bond of physical sympathy, is far less simple and obvious; and though the use of fireas a charm to produce sunshine appears to be undeniable, nevertheless in attempting toexplain popular customs we should never have recourse to a more recondite idea when asimpler one lies to hand and is supported by the explicit testimony of the people themselves.Now in the case of the fire-festivals the destructive aspect of fire is one upon which the peo-ple dwell again and again; and it is highly significant that the great evil against which the fireis directed appears to be witchcraft. Again and again we are told that the fires are intended toburn or repel the witches; and the intention is sometimes graphically expressed by burning aneffigy of a witch in the fire. Hence, when we remember the great hold which the dread ofwitchcraft has had on the popular European mind in all ages, we may suspect that the pri-mary intention of all these fire-festivals was simply to destroy or at all events get rid of thewitches, who were regarded as the causes of nearly all the misfortunes and calamities thatbefall men, their cattle, and their crops.This suspicion is confirmed when we examine the evils for which the bonfires and torcheswere supposed to provide a remedy. Foremost, perhaps, among these evils we may reckonthe diseases of cattle; and of all the ills that witches are believed to work there is probablynone which is so constantly insisted on as the harm they do to the herds, particularly by steal-ing the milk from the cows. Now it is significant that the need-fire, which may perhaps beregarded as the parent of the periodic fire-festivals, is kindled above all as a remedy for amurrain or other disease of cattle; and the circumstance suggests, what on general groundsseems probable, that the custom of kindling the need-fire goes back to a time when theancestors of the European peoples subsisted chiefly on the products of their herds, and whenagriculture as yet played a subordinate part in their lives. Witches and wolves are the twogreat foes still dreaded by the herdsman in many parts of Europe; and we need not wonderthat he should resort to fire as a powerful means of banning them both. Among Slavonic peo-ples it appears that the foes whom the need-fire is designed to combat are not so much livingwitches as vampyres and other evil spirits, and the ceremony aims rather at repelling thesebaleful beings than at actually consuming them in the flames. But for our present purposethese distinctions are immaterial. The important thing to observe is that among the Slavs theneed-fire, which is probably the original of all the ceremonial fires now under consideration, isnot a sun-charm, but clearly and unmistakably nothing but a means of protecting man andPage 498"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"beast against the attacks of maleficent creatures, whom the peasant thinks to burn or scareby the heat of the fire, just as he might burn or scare wild animals.Again, the bonfires are often supposed to protect the fields against hail and the homesteadagainst thunder and lightning. But both hail and thunderstorms are frequently thought to becaused by witches; hence the fire which bans the witches necessarily serves at the sametime as a talisman against hail, thunder, and lightning. Further, brands taken from the bonfiresare commonly kept in the houses to guard them against conflagration; and though this mayperhaps be done on the principle of homoeopathic magic, one fire being thought to act as apreventive of another, it is also possible that the intention may be to keep witch-incendiariesat bay. Again, people leap over the bonfires as a preventive of colic, and look at the flamessteadily in order to preserve their eyes in good health; and both colic and sore eyes are inGermany, and probably elsewhere, set down to the machinations of witches. Once more, toleap over the midsummer fires or to circumambulate them is thought to prevent a person fromfeeling pains in his back at reaping; and in Germany such pains are called “witch-shots” andascribed to witchcraft.But if the bonfires and torches of the fire-festivals are to be regarded primarily as weaponsdirected against witches and wizards, it becomes probable that the same explanation appliesnot only to the flaming discs which are hurled into the air, but also to the burning wheelswhich are rolled down hill on these occasions; discs and wheels, we may suppose, are alikeintended to burn the witches who hover invisible in the air or haunt unseen the fields, theorchards, and the vineyards on the hillside. Certainly witches are constantly thought to ridethrough the air on broomsticks or other equally convenient vehicles; and if they do so, howcan you get at them so effectually as by hurling lighted missiles, whether discs, torches, orbesoms, after them as they flit past overhead in the gloom? The South Slavonian peasantbelieves that witches ride in the dark hail-clouds; so he shoots at the clouds to bring down thehags, while he curses them, saying, “Curse, curse Herodias, thy mother is a heathen,damned of God and fettered through the Redeemer’s blood.” Also he brings out a pot of glow-ing charcoal on which he has thrown holy oil, laurel leaves, and wormwood to make a smoke.The fumes are supposed to ascend to the clouds and stupefy the witches, so that they tumbledown to earth. And in order that they may not fall soft, but may hurt themselves very much,the yokel hastily brings out a chair and tilts it bottom up so that the witch in falling may breakher legs on the legs of the chair. Worse than that, he cruelly lays scythes, bill-hooks, andother formidable weapons edge upwards so as to cut and mangle the poor wretches whenthey drop plump upon them from the clouds.On this view the fertility supposed to follow the application of fire in the form of bonfires,torches, discs, rolling wheels, and so forth, is not conceived as resulting directly from anincrease of solar heat which the fire has magically generated; it is merely an indirect resultobtained by freeing the reproductive powers of plants and animals from the fatal obstructionof witchcraft. And what is true of the reproduction of plants and animals may hold good alsoof the fertility of the human sexes. The bonfires are supposed to promote marriage and toprocure offspring for childless couples. This happy effect need not flow directly from anyquickening or fertilising energy in the fire; it may follow indirectly from the power of the fire toremove those obstacles which the spells of witches and wizards notoriously present to theunion of man and wife.On the whole, then, the theory of the purificatory virtue of the ceremonial fires appears moreprobable and more in accordance with the evidence than the opposing theory of their connex-Page 499"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"ion with the sun.Chapter LXIVThe Burning of Human Beings in the Fires1. THE BURNING OF EFFIGIES IN THE FIRESWE have still to ask, What is the meaning of burning effigies in the fire at these festivals?After the preceding investigation the answer to the question seems obvious. As the fires areoften alleged to be kindled for the purpose of burning the witches, and as the effigy burnt inthem is sometimes called “the Witch,” we might naturally be disposed to conclude that all theeffigies consumed in the flames on these occasions represent witches or warlocks, and thatthe custom of burning them is merely a substitute for burning the wicked men and womenthemselves, since on the principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic you practically destroythe witch herself in destroying her effigy. On the whole this explanation of the burning of strawfigures in human shape at the festivals is perhaps the most probable.Yet it may be that this explanation does not apply to all the cases, and that certain of themmay admit and even require another interpretation. For the effigies so burned, as I havealready remarked, can hardly be separated from the effigies of Death which are burned orotherwise destroyed in spring; and grounds have been already given for regarding the so-called effigies of Death as really representatives of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation. Arethe other effigies, which are burned in the spring and midsummer bonfires, susceptible of thesame explanation? It would seem so. For just as the fragments of the so-called Death arestuck in the fields to make the crops grow, so the charred embers of the figure burned in thespring bonfires are sometimes laid on the fields in the belief that they will keep vermin fromthe crop. Again, the rule that the last married bride must leap over the fire in which the straw-man is burned on Shrove Tuesday, is probably intended to make her fruitful. But, as we haveseen, the power of blessing women with offspring is a special attribute of tree-spirits; it istherefore a fair presumption that the burning effigy over which the bride must leap is a repre-sentative of the fertilising tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation. This character of the effigy, as rep-resentative of the spirit of vegetation, is almost unmistakable when the figure is composed ofan unthreshed sheaf of corn or is covered from head to foot with flowers. Again, it is to benoted that, instead of a puppet, trees, either living or felled, are sometimes burned both in thespring and midsummer bonfires. Now, considering the frequency with which the tree-spirit isrepresented in human shape, it is hardly rash to suppose that when sometimes a tree andsometimes an effigy is burned in these fires, the effigy and the tree are regarded as equiva-lent to each other, each being a representative of the tree-spirit. This, again, is confirmed byobserving, first, that sometimes the effigy which is to be burned is carried about simultane-ously with a May-tree, the former being carried by the boys, the latter by the girls; and, sec-ond, that the effigy is sometimes tied to a living tree and burned with it. In these cases, wecan scarcely doubt, the tree-spirit is represented, as we have found it represented before, induplicate, both by the tree and by the effigy. That the true character of the effigy as a repre-sentative of the beneficent spirit of vegetation should sometimes be forgotten, is natural. Thecustom of burning a beneficent god is too foreign to later modes of thought to escape misin-terpretation. Naturally enough the people who continued to burn his image came in time toidentify it as the effigy of persons, whom, on various grounds, they regarded with aversion,such as Judas Iscariot, Luther, and a witch.The general reasons for killing a god or his representative have been examined in a preced-Page 500"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"ing chapter. But when the god happens to be a deity of vegetation, there are special reasonswhy he should die by fire. For light and heat are necessary to vegetable growth; and, on theprinciple of sympathetic magic, by subjecting the personal representative of vegetation totheir influence, you secure a supply of these necessaries for trees and crops. In other words,by burning the spirit of vegetation in a fire which represents the sun, you make sure that, for atime at least, vegetation shall have plenty of sun. It may be objected that, if the intention issimply to secure enough sunshine for vegetation, this end would be better attained, on theprinciples of sympathetic magic, by merely passing the representative of vegetation throughthe fire instead of burning him. In point of fact this is sometimes done. In Russia, as we haveseen, the straw figure of Kupalo is not burned in the midsummer fire, but merely carried back-wards and forwards across it. But, for the reasons already given, it is necessary that the godshould die; so next day Kupalo is stripped of her ornaments and thrown into a stream. In thisRussian custom the passage of the image through the fire, if it is not simply a purification,may possibly be a sun-charm; the killing of the god is a separate act, and the mode of killinghim—by drowning—is probably a rain-charm. But usually peoplehave not thought it necessary to draw this fine distinction; for the various reasons alreadyassigned, it is advantageous, they think, to expose the godof vegetation to a considerable degree of heat, and it is also advantageous to kill him, andthey combine these advantages in a rough-and-ready way by burning him.2. THE BURNING OF MEN AND ANIMALS IN THE FIRESIn the popular customs connected with the fire-festivals of Europe there are certain featureswhich appear to point to a former practice of human sacrifice. We have seen reasons forbelieving that in Europe living persons have often acted as representatives of the tree-spiritand corn-spirit and have suffered death as such. There is no reason, therefore, why theyshould not have been burned, if any special advantages were likely to be attained by puttingthem to death in that way. The consideration of human suffering is not one which enters intothe calculations of primitive man. Now, in the fire-festivals which we are discussing, the pre-tence of burning people is sometimes carried so far that it seems reasonable to regard it as amitigated survival of an older custom of actually burning them. Thus in Aachen, as we saw,the man clad in peas-straw acts so cleverly that the children really believe he is being burned.At Jumièges in Normandy the man clad all in green, who bore the title of the Green Wolf, waspursued by his comrades, and when they caught him they feigned to fling him upon the mid-summer bonfire. Similarly at the Beltane fires in Scotland the pretended victim was seized,and a show made of throwing him into the flames, and for some time afterwards peopleaffected to speak of him as dead. Again, in the Hallowe’en bonfires of Northeastern Scotlandwe may perhaps detect a similar pretence in the custom observed by a lad of lying down asclose to the fire as possible and allowing the other lads to leap over him. The titular king atAix, who reigned for a year and danced the first dance round the midsummer bonfire, mayperhaps in days of old have discharged the less agreeable duty of serving as fuel for that firewhich in later times he only kindled. In the following customs Mannhardt is probably right inrecognising traces of an old custom of burning a leaf-clad representative of the spirit of vege-tation. At Wolfeck, in Austria, on Midsummer Day, a boy completely clad in green fir branchesgoes from house to house, accompanied by a noisy crew, collecting wood for the bonfire. Ashe gets the wood he sings: “Forest trees I want, No sour milk for me, But beer and wine, Page 501"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"So can the wood-man be jolly and gay.”In some parts of Bavaria, also, the boys who go from house to house collecting fuel for themidsummer bonfire envelop one of their number from head to foot in green branches of firs,and lead him by a rope through the whole village. At Moosheim, in Wurtemberg, the festival ofSt. John’s Fire usually lasted for fourteen days, ending on the second Sunday afterMidsummer Day. On this last day the bonfire was left in charge of the children, while the olderpeople retired to a wood. Here they encased a young fellow in leaves and twigs, who, thusdisguised, went to the fire, scattered it, and trod it out. All the people present fled at the sightof him.But it seems possible to go farther than this. Of human sacrifices offered on these occasionsthe most unequivocal traces, as we have seen, are those which, about a hundred years ago,still lingered at the Beltane fires in the Highlands of Scotland, that is, among a Celtic peoplewho, situated in a remote corner of Europe and almost completely isolated from foreign influ-ence, had till then conserved their old heathenism better perhaps than any other people in theWest of Europe. It is significant, therefore, that human sacrifices by fire are known, onunquestionable evidence, to have been systematically practised by the Celts. The earliestdescription of these sacrifices has been bequeathed to us by Julius Caesar. As conqueror ofthe hitherto independent Celts of Gaul, Caesar had ample opportunity of observing thenational Celtic religion and manners, while these were still fresh and crisp from the nativemint and had not yet been fused in the melting-pot of Roman civilisation. With his own notesCaesar appears to have incorporated the observations of a Greek explorer, by namePosidonius, who travelled in Gaul about fifty years before Caesar carried the Roman arms tothe English Channel. The Greek geographer Strabo and the historian Diodorus seem also tohave derived their descriptions of the Celtic sacrifices from the work of Posidonius, but inde-pendently of each other, and of Caesar, for each of the three derivative accounts containsome details which are not to be found in either of the others. By combining them, therefore,we can restore the original account of Posidonius with some probability, and thus obtain apicture of the sacrifices offered by the Celts of Gaul at the close of the second century beforeour era. The following seem to have been the main outlines of the custom. Condemned crimi-nals were reserved by the Celts in order to be sacrificed to the gods at a great festival whichtook place once in every five years. The more there were of such victims, the greater wasbelieved to be the fertility of the land. If there were not enough criminals to furnish victims,captives taken in war were immolated to supply the deficiency. When the time came the vic-tims were sacrificed by the Druids or priests. Some they shot down with arrows, some theyimpaled, and some they burned alive in the following manner. Colossal images of wicker-workor of wood and grass were constructed; these were filled with live men, cattle, and animals ofother kinds; fire was then applied to the images, and they were burned with their living con-tents.Such were the great festivals held once every five years. But besides these quinquennial fes-tivals, celebrated on so grand a scale, and with, apparently, so large an expenditure of humanlife, it seems reasonable to suppose that festivals of the same sort, only on a lesser scale,were held annually, and that from these annual festivals are lineally descended some at leastof the fire-festivals which, with their traces of human sacrifices, are still celebrated year byyear in many parts of Europe. The gigantic images constructed of osiers or covered withgrass in which the Druids enclosed their victims remind us of the leafy framework in which thehuman representative of the tree-spirit is still so often encased. Hence, seeing that the fertilityof the land was apparently supposed to depend upon the due performance of these sacri-Page 502"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"fices, Mannhardt interpreted the Celtic victims, cased in osiers and grass, as representativesof the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation.These wicker giants of the Druids seem to have had till lately, if not down to the present time,their representatives at the spring and midsummer festivals of modern Europe. At Douay,down at least to the early part of the nineteenth century, a procession took place annually onthe Sunday nearest to the seventh of July. The great feature of the procession was a colossalfigure, some twenty or thirty feet high, made of osiers, and called “the giant,” which wasmoved through the streets by means of rollers and ropes worked by men who were enclosedwithin the effigy. The figure was armed as a knight with lance and sword, helmet and shield.Behind him marched his wife and his three children, all constructed of osiers on the sameprinciple, but on a smaller scale. At Dunkirk the procession of the giants took place onMidsummer Day, the twenty-fourth of June. The festival, which was known as the Follies ofDunkirk, attracted multitudes of spectators. The giant was a huge figure of wicker-work, occa-sionally as much as forty-five feet high, dressed in a long blue robe with gold stripes, whichreached to his feet, concealing the dozen or more men who made it dance and bob its headto the spectators. This colossal effigy went by the name of Papa Reuss, and carried in itspocket a bouncing infant of Brobdingnagian proportions. The rear was brought up by thedaughter of the giant, constructed, like her sire, of wicker-work, and little, if at all, inferior tohim in size. Most towns and even villages of Brabant and Flanders have, or used to have,similar wicker giants which were annually led about to the delight of the populace, who lovedthese grotesque figures, spoke of them with patriotic enthusiasm, and never wearied of gaz-ing at them. At Antwerp the giant was so big that no gate in the city was large enough to lethim go through; hence he could not visit his brother giants in neighbouring towns, as theother Belgian giants used to do on solemn occasions.In England artificial giants seem to have been a standing feature of the midsummer festival. Awriter of the sixteenth century speaks of “Midsommer pageants in London, where to make thepeople wonder, are set forth great and uglie gyants marching as if they were alive, and armedat all points, but within they are stuffed full of browne paper and tow, which the shrewd boyes,underpeering, do guilefully discover, and turne to a greate derision.” At Chester the annualpageant on Midsummer Eve included the effigies of four giants, with animals, hobby-horses,and other figures. At Coventry it appears that the giant’s wife figured beside the giant. AtBurford, in Oxfordshire, Midsummer Eve used to be celebrated with great jollity by the carry-ing of a giant and a dragon up and down the town. The last survivor of these perambulatingEnglish giants lingered at Salisbury, where an antiquary found him mouldering to decay in theneglected hall of the Tailors’ Company about the year 1844. His bodily framework was a lathand hoop, like the one which used to be worn by Jack-in-the-Green on May Day.In these cases the giants merely figured in the processions. But sometimes they were burnedin the summer bonfires. Thus the people of the Rue aux Ours in Paris used annually to makea great wicker-work figure, dressed as a soldier, which they promenaded up and down thestreets for several days, and solemnly burned on the third of July, the crowd of spectatorssinging Salve Regina. A personage who bore the title of king presided over the ceremony witha lighted torch in his hand. The burning fragments of the image were scattered among thepeople, who eagerly scrambled for them. The custom was abolished in 1743. In Brie, Isle deFrance, a wicker-work giant, eighteen feet high, was annually burned on Midsummer Eve.Again, the Druidical custom of burning live animals, enclosed in wicker-work, has its counter-part at the spring and midsummer festivals. At Luchon in the Pyrenees on Midsummer Eve “aPage 503"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"hollow column, composed of strong wicker-work, is raised to the height of about sixty feet inthe centre of the principal suburb, and interlaced with green foliage up to the very top; whilethe most beautiful flowers and shrubs procurable are artistically arranged in groups below, soas to form a sort of background to the scene. The column is then filled with combustiblematerials, ready for ignition. At an appointed hour—about 8 P.M.—a grand procession, com-posed of the clergy, followed by young men and maidens in holiday attire, pour forth from thetown chanting hymns, and take up their position around the column. Meanwhile, bonfires arelit, with beautiful effect, in the surrounding hills. As many living serpents as could be collectedare now thrown into the column, which is set on fire at the base by means of torches, armedwith which about fifty boys and men dance around with frantic gestures. The serpents, toavoid the flames, wriggle their way to the top, whence they are seen lashing out laterally untilfinally obliged to drop, their struggles for life giving rise to enthusiastic delight among the sur-rounding spectators. This is a favourite annual ceremony for the inhabitants of Luchon and itsneighbourhood, and local tradition assigns it to a heathen origin.” In the midsummer fires for-merly kindled on the Place de Grève at Paris it was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, orsack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes afox was burned. The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home,believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles andeven lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 Louis the Fourteenth, crowned with awreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it andpartook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when amonarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At Metz midsummer fires were lightedwith great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in wicker cages, were burnedalive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly at Gap, in the department of the HighAlps, cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire. In Russia a white cock was some-times burned in the midsummer bonfire; in Meissen or Thuringia a horse’s head used to bethrown into it. Sometimes animals are burned in the spring bonfires. In the Vosges cats wereburned on Shrove Tuesday; in Alsace they were thrown into the Easter bonfire. In the depart-ment of the Ardennes cats were flung into the bonfires kindled on the first Sunday in Lent;sometimes, by a refinement of cruelty, they were hung over the fire from the end of a poleand roasted alive. “The cat, which represented the devil, could never suffer enough.” Whilethe creatures were perishing in the flames, the shepherds guarded their flocks and forcedthem to leap over the fire, esteeming this an infallible means of preserving them from diseaseand witchcraft. We have seen that squirrels were sometimes burned in the Easter fire.Thus it appears that the sacrificial rites of the Celts of ancient Gaul can be traced in the popu-lar festivals of modern Europe. Naturally it is in France, or rather in the wider area comprisedwithin the limits of ancient Gaul, that these rites have left the clearest traces in the customs ofburning giants of wicker-work and animals enclosed in wicker-work or baskets. These cus-toms, it will have been remarked, are generally observed at or about midsummer. From thiswe may infer that the original rites of which these are the degenerate successors were solem-nised at midsummer. This inference harmonises with the conclusion suggested by a generalsurvey of European folk-custom, that the midsummer festival must on the whole have beenthe most widely diffused and the most solemn of all the yearly festivals celebrated by theprimitive Aryans in Europe. At the same time we must bear in mind that among the BritishCelts the chief fire-festivals of the year appear certainly to have been those of Beltane (MayDay) and Hallowe’en (the last day of October); and this suggests a doubt whether the Celts ofGaul also may not have celebrated their principal rites of fire, including their burnt sacrificesof men and animals, at the beginning of May or the beginning of November rather than atMidsummer.Page 504"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"We have still to ask, What is the meaning of such sacrifices? Why were men and animalsburnt to death at these festivals? If we are right in interpreting the modern European fire-festi-vals as attempts to break the power of witchcraft by burning or banning the witches and war-locks, it seems to follow that we must explain the human sacrifices of the Celts in the samemanner; that is, we must suppose that the men whom the Druids burnt in wicker-work imageswere condemned to death on the ground that they were witches or wizards, and that themode of execution by fire was chosen because burning alive is deemed the surest mode ofgetting rid of these noxious and dangerous beings. The same explanation would apply to thecattle and wild animals of many kinds which the Celts burned along with the men. They, too,we may conjecture, were supposed to be either under the spell of witchcraft or actually to bethe witches and wizards, who had transformed themselves into animals for the purpose ofprosecuting their infernal plots against the welfare of their fellow-creatures. This conjecture isconfirmed by the observation that the victims most commonly burned in modern bonfires havebeen cats, and that cats are precisely the animals into which, with the possible exception ofhares, witches were most usually supposed to transform themselves. Again, we have seenthat serpents and foxes used sometimes to be burnt in the midsummer fires; and Welsh andGerman witches are reported to have assumed the form both of foxes and serpents. In short,when we remember the great variety of animals whose forms witches can assume at pleas-ure, it seems easy on this hypothesis to account for the variety of living creatures that havebeen burnt at festivals both in ancient Gaul and modern Europe; all these victims, we maysurmise, were doomed to the flames, not because they were animals, but because they werebelieved to be witches who had taken the shape of animals for their nefarious purposes. Oneadvantage of explaining the ancient Celtic sacrifices in this way is that it introduces, as itwere, a harmony and consistency into the treatment which Europe has meted out to witchesfrom the earliest times down to about two centuries ago, when the growing influence of ration-alism discredited the belief in witchcraft and put a stop to the custom of burning witches. Bethat as it may, we can now perhaps understand why the Druids believed that the more per-sons they sentenced to death, the greater would be the fertility of the land. To a modern read-er the connexion at first sight may not be obvious between the activity of the hangman andthe productivity of the earth. But a little reflection may satisfy him that when the criminals whoperish at the stake or on the gallows are witches, whose delight it is to blight the crops of thefarmer or to lay them low under storms of hail, the execution of these wretches is really calcu-lated to ensure an abundant harvest by removing one of the principal causes which paralysethe efforts and blast the hopes of the husbandman.The Druidical sacrifices which we are considering were explained in a different way by W.Mannhardt. He supposed that the men whom the Druids burned in wicker-work images repre-sented the spirits of vegetation, and accordingly that the custom of burning them was a magi-cal ceremony intended to secure the necessary sunshine for the crops. Similarly, he seems tohave inclined to the view that the animals which used to be burnt in the bonfires representedthe cornspirit, which, as we saw in an earlier part of this work, is often supposed to assumethe shape of an animal. This theory is no doubt tenable, and the great authority of W.Mannhardt entitles it to careful consideration. I adopted it in former editions of this book; buton reconsideration it seems to me on the whole to be less probable than the theory that themen and animals burnt in the fires perished in the character of witches. This latter view isstrongly supported by the testimony of the people who celebrate the fire-festivals, since apopular name for the custom of kindling the fires is “burning the witches,” effigies of witchesare sometimes consumed in the flames, and the fires, their embers, or their ashes are sup-posed to furnish protection against witchcraft. On the other hand there is little to show that thePage 505"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"effigies or the animals burnt in the fires are regarded by the people as representatives of thevegetation-spirit, and that the bonfires are sun-charms. With regard to serpents in particular,which used to be burnt in the midsummer fire at Luchon, I am not aware of any certain evi-dence that in Europe snakes have been regarded as embodiments of the tree-spirit or corn-spirit, though in other parts of the world the conception appears to be not unknown. Whereasthe popular faith in the transformation of witches into animals is so general and deeply rooted,and the fear of these uncanny beings is so strong, that it seems safer to suppose that thecats and other animals which were burnt in the fire suffered death as embodiments of witchesthan that they perished as representatives of vegetation-spirits.Chapter LXVBalder and the MistletoeTHE reader may remember that the preceding account of the popular fire-festivals of Europewas suggested by the myth of the Norse god Balder, who is said to have been slain by abranch of mistletoe and burnt in a great fire. We have now to enquire how far the customswhich have been passed in review help to shed light on the myth. In this enquiry it may beconvenient to begin with the mistletoe, the instrument of Balder’s death.From time immemorial the mistletoe has been the object of superstitious veneration inEurope. It was worshipped by the Druids, as we learn from a famous passage of Pliny. Afterenumerating the different kinds of mistletoe, he proceeds: “In treating of this subject, theadmiration in which the mistletoe is held throughout Gaul ought not to pass unnoticed. TheDruids, for so they call their wizards, esteem nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and thetree on which it grows, provided only that the tree is an oak. But apart from this they chooseoak-woods for their sacred groves and perform no sacred rites without oak-leaves; so that thevery name of Druids may be regarded as a Greek appellation derived from their worship ofthe oak. For they believe that whatever grows on these trees is sent from heaven, and is asign that the tree has been chosen by the god himself. The mistletoe is very rarely to be metwith; but when it is found, they gather it with solemn ceremony. This they do above all on thesixth day of the moon, from whence they date the beginnings of their months, of their years,and of their thirty years’ cycle, because by the sixth day the moon has plenty of vigour andhas not run half its course. After due preparations have been made for a sacrifice and a feastunder the tree, they hail it as the universal healer and bring to the spot two white bulls, whosehorns have never been bound before. A priest clad in a white robe climbs the tree and with agolden sickle cuts the mistletoe, which is caught in a white cloth. Then they sacrifice the vic-tims, praying that God may make his own gift to prosper with those upon whom he hasbestowed it. They believe that a potion prepared from mistletoe will make barren animals tobring forth, and that the plant is a remedy against all poison.”In another passage Pliny tells us that in medicine the mistletoe which grows on an oak wasesteemed the most efficacious, and that its efficacy was by some superstitious people sup-posed to be increased if the plant was gathered on the first day of the moon without the useof iron, and if when gathered it was not allowed to touch the earth; oak-mistletoe thusobtained was deemed a cure for epilepsy; carried about by women it assisted them to con-ceive; and it healed ulcers most effectually, if only the sufferer chewed a piece of the plantand laid another piece on the sore. Yet, again, he says that mistletoe was supposed, likevinegar and an egg, to be an excellent means of extinguishing a fire.If in these latter passages Pliny refers, as he apparently does, to the beliefs current amongPage 506"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"his contemporaries in Italy, it will follow that the Druids and the Italians were to some extentagreed as to the valuable properties possessed by mistletoe which grows on an oak; both ofthem deemed it an effectual remedy for a number of ailments, and both of them ascribed to ita quickening virtue, the Druids believing that a potion prepared from mistletoe would fertilisebarren cattle, and the Italians holding that a piece of mistletoe carried about by a womanwould help her to conceive a child. Further, both peoples thought that if the plant were toexert its medicinal properties it must be gathered in a certain way and at a certain time. Itmight not be cut with iron, hence the Druids cut it with gold; and it might not touch the earth,hence the Druids caught it in a white cloth. In choosing the time for gathering the plant, bothpeoples were determined by observation of the moon; only they differed as to the particularday of the moon, the Italians preferring the first, and the Druids the sixth.With these beliefs of the ancient Gauls and Italians as to the wonderful medicinal propertiesof mistletoe we may compare the similar beliefs of the modern Aino of Japan. We read thatthey, “like many nations of the Northern origin, hold the mistletoe in peculiar veneration. Theylook upon it as a medicine, good in almost every disease, and it is sometimes taken in foodand at others separately as a decoction. The leaves are used in preference to the berries, thelatter being of too sticky a nature for general purposes.... But many, too, suppose this plant tohave the power of making the gardens bear plentifully. When used for this purpose, theleaves are cut up into fine pieces, and, after having been prayed over, are sown with the mil-let and other seeds, a little also being eaten with the food. Barren women have also beenknown to eat the mistletoe, in order to be made to bear children. That mistletoe which growsupon the willow is supposed to have the greatest efficacy. This is because the willow islooked upon by them as being an especially sacred tree.”Thus the Aino agree with the Druids in regarding mistletoe as a cure for almost every dis-ease, and they agree with the ancient Italians that applied to women it helps them to bearchildren. Again, the Druidical notion that the mistletoe was an “all-healer” or panacea may becompared with a notion entertained by the Walos of Senegambia. These people “have muchveneration for a sort of mistletoe, which they call tob; they carry leaves of it on their personswhen they go to war as a preservative against wounds, just as if the leaves were real talis-mans (gris-gris).” The French writer who records this practice adds: “Is it not very curious thatthe mistletoe should be in this part of Africa what it was in the superstitions of the Gauls? Thisprejudice, common to the two countries, may have the same origin; blacks and whites willdoubtless have seen, each of them for themselves, something supernatural in a plant whichgrows and flourishes without having roots in the earth. May they not have believed, in fact,that it was a plant fallen from the sky, a gift of the divinity?”This suggestion as to the origin of the superstition is strongly confirmed by the Druidicalbelief, reported by Pliny, that whatever grew on an oak was sent from heaven and was a signthat the tree had been chosen by the god himself. Such a belief explains why the Druids cutthe mistletoe, not with a common knife, but with a golden sickle, and why, when cut, it wasnot suffered to touch the earth; probably they thought that the celestial plant would have beenprofaned and its marvellous virtue lost by contact with the ground. With the ritual observed bythe Druids in cutting the mistletoe we may compare the ritual which in Cambodia is pre-scribed in a similar case. They say that when you see an orchid growing as a parasite on atamarind tree, you should dress in white, take a new earthenware pot, then climb the tree atnoon, break off the plant, put it in the pot and let the pot fall to the ground. After that youmake in the pot a decoction which confers the gift of invulnerability. Thus just as in Africa theleaves of one parasitic plant are supposed to render the wearer invulnerable, so in CambodiaPage 507"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"a decoction made from another parasitic plant is considered to render the same service tosuch as make use of it, whether by drinking or washing. We may conjecture that in bothplaces the notion of invulnerability is suggested by the position of the plant, which, occupyinga place of comparative security above the ground, appears to promise to its fortunate posses-sor a similar security from some of the ills that beset the life of man on earth. We havealready met with examples of the store which the primitive mind sets on such vantagegrounds.Whatever may be the origin of these beliefs and practices concerning the mistletoe, certain itis that some of them have their analogies in the folk-lore of modern European peasants. Forexample, it is laid down as a rule in various parts of Europe that mistletoe may not be cut inthe ordinary way but must be shot or knocked down with stones from the tree on which it isgrowing. Thus, in the Swiss canton of Aargau “all parasitic plants are esteemed in a certainsense holy by the country folk, but most particularly so the mistletoe growing on an oak. Theyascribe great powers to it, but shrink from cutting it off in the usual manner. Instead of thatthey procure it in the following manner. When the sun is in Sagittarius and the moon is on thewane, on the first, third, or fourth day before the new moon, one ought to shoot down with anarrow the mistletoe of an oak and to catch it with the left hand as it falls. Such mistletoe is aremedy for every ailment of children.” Here among the Swiss peasants, as among the Druidsof old, special virtue is ascribed to mistletoe which grows on an oak: it may not be cut in theusual way: it must be caught as it falls to the ground; and it is esteemed a panacea for all dis-eases, at least of children. In Sweden, also, it is a popular superstition that if mistletoe is topossess its peculiar virtue, it must either be shot down out of the oak or knocked down withstones. Similarly, “so late as the early part of the nineteenth century, people in Wales believedthat for the mistletoe to have any power, it must be shot or struck down with stones off thetree where it grew.”Again, in respect of the healing virtues of mistletoe the opinion of modern peasants, and evenof the learned, has to some extent agreed with that of the ancients. The Druids appear tohave called the plant, or perhaps the oak on which it grew, the “all-healer”; and “all-healer” issaid to be still a name of the mistletoe in the modern Celtic speech of Brittany, Wales, Ireland,and Scotland. On St. John’s morning (Midsummer morning) peasants of Piedmont andLombardy go out to search the oak-leaves for the “oil of St. John,” which is supposed to healall wounds made with cutting instruments. Originally, perhaps, the “oil of St. John” was simplythe mistletoe, or a decoction made from it. For in Holstein the mistletoe, especially oak-mistle-toe, is still regarded as a panacea for green wounds and as a sure charm to secure successin hunting; and at Lacaune, in the south of France, the old Druidical belief in the mistletoe asan antidote to all poisons still survives among the peasantry; they apply the plant to the stom-ach of the sufferer or give him a decoction of it to drink. Again, the ancient belief that mistle-toe is a cure for epilepsy has survived in modern times not only among the ignorant butamong the learned. Thus in Sweden persons afflicted with the falling sickness think they canward off attacks of the malady by carrying about with them a knife which has a handle of oakmistletoe; and in Germany for a similar purpose pieces of mistletoe used to be hung roundthe necks of children. In the French province of Bourbonnais a popular remedy for epilepsy isa decoction of mistletoe which has been gathered on an oak on St. John’s Day and boiledwith rye-flour. So at Bottesford in Lincolnshire a decoction of mistletoe is supposed to be apalliative for this terrible disease. Indeed mistletoe was recommended as a remedy for thefalling sickness by high medical authorities in England and Holland down to the eighteenthcentury.Page 508"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"However, the opinion of the medical profession as to the curative virtues of mistletoe hasundergone a radical alteration. Whereas the Druids thought that mistletoe cured everything,modern doctors appear to think that it cures nothing. If they are right, we must conclude thatthe ancient and widespread faith in the medicinal virtue of mistletoe is a pure superstitionbased on nothing better than the fanciful inferences which ignorance has drawn from the par-asitic nature of the plant, its position high up on the branch of a tree seeming to protect itfrom the dangers to which plants and animals are subject on the surface of the ground. Fromthis point of view we can perhaps understand why mistletoe has so long and so persistentlybeen prescribed as a cure for the falling sickness. As mistletoe cannot fall to the groundbecause it is rooted on the branch of a tree high above the earth, it seems to follow as a nec-essary consequence that an epileptic patient cannot possibly fall down in a fit so long as hecarries a piece of mistletoe in his pocket or a decoction of mistletoe in his stomach. Such atrain of reasoning would probably be regarded even now as cogent by a large portion of thehuman species.Again the ancient Italian opinion that mistletoe extinguishes fire appears to be shared bySwedish peasants, who hang up bunches of oak-mistletoe on the ceilings of their rooms as aprotection against harm in general and conflagration in particular. A hint as to the way inwhich mistletoe comes to be possessed of this property is furnished by the epithet “thunder-bosom,” which people of the Aargau canton in Switzerland apply to the plant. For a thunder-besom is a shaggy, bushy excrescence on branches of trees, which is popularly believed tobe produced by a flash of lightning; hence in Bohemia a thunder-besom burnt in the fire pro-tects the house against being struck by a thunder-bolt. Being itself a product of lightning itnaturally serves, on homoeopathic principles, as a protection against lightning, in fact as akind of lightning-conductor. Hence the fire which mistletoe in Sweden is designed especiallyto avert from houses may be fire kindled by lightning; though no doubt the plant is equallyeffective against conflagration in general.Again, mistletoe acts as a master-key as well as a lightning-conductor; for it is said to open alllocks. But perhaps the most precious of all the virtues of mistletoe is that it affords efficientprotection against sorcery and witchcraft. That, no doubt, is the reason why in Austria a twigof mistletoe is laid on the threshold as a preventive of nightmare; and it may be the reasonwhy in the north of England they say that if you wish your dairy to thrive you should give yourbunch of mistletoe to the first cow that calves after New Year’s Day, for it is well known thatnothing is so fatal to milk and butter as witchcraft. Similarly in Wales, for the sake of ensuringgood luck to the dairy, people used to give a branch of mistletoe to the first cow that gavebirth to a calf after the first hour of the New Year; and in rural districts of Wales, where mistle-toe abounded, there was always a profusion of it in the farmhouses. When mistletoe wasscarce, Welsh farmers used to say, “No mistletoe, no luck”; but if there was a fine crop ofmistletoe, they expected a fine crop of corn. In Sweden mistletoe is diligently sought after onSt. John’s Eve, the people “believing it to be, in a high degree, possessed of mystic qualities;and that if a sprig of it be attached to the ceiling of the dwelling-house, the horse’s stall, or thecow’s crib, the Troll will then be powerless to injure either man or beast.”With regard to the time when the mistletoe should be gathered opinions have varied. TheDruids gathered it above all on the sixth day of the moon, the ancient Italians apparently onthe first day of the moon. In modern times some have preferred the full moon of March andothers the waning moon of winter when the sun is in Sagittarius. But the favourite time wouldseem to be Midsummer Eve or Midsummer Day. We have seen that both in France andSweden special virtues are ascribed to mistletoe gathered at Midsummer. The rule in SwedenPage 509"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"is that “mistletoe must be cut on the night of Midsummer Eve when sun and moon stand inthe sign of their might.” Again, in Wales it was believed that a sprig of mistletoe gathered onSt. John’s Eve (Midsummer Eve), or at any time before the berries appeared, would inducedreams of omen, both good and bad, if it were placed under the pillow of the sleeper. Thusmistletoe is one of the many plants whose magical or medicinal virtues are believed to culmi-nate with the culmination of the sun on the longest day of the year. Hence it seems reason-able to conjecture that in the eyes of the Druids, also, who revered the plant so highly, thesacred mistletoe may have acquired a double portion of its mystic qualities at the solstice inJune, and that accordingly they may have regularly cut it with solemn ceremony onMidsummer Eve.Be that as it may, certain it is that the mistletoe, the instrument of Balder’s death, has beenregularly gathered for the sake of its mystic qualities on Midsummer Eve in Scandinavia,Balder’s home. The plant is found commonly growing on pear-trees, oaks, and other trees inthick damp woods throughout the more temperate parts of Sweden. Thus one of the two mainincidents of Balder’s myth is reproduced in the great midsummer festival of Scandinavia. Butthe other main incident of the myth, the burning of Balder’s body on a pyre, has also its coun-terpart in the bonfires which still blaze, or blazed till lately, in Denmark, Norway, and Swedenon Midsummer Eve. It does not appear, indeed, that any effigy is burned in these bonfires;but the burning of an effigy is a feature which might easily drop out after its meaning was for-gotten. And the name of Balder’s balefires (Balder’s Ba&breve;lar), by which these midsum-mer fires were formerly known in Sweden, puts their connexion with Balder beyond the reachof doubt, and makes it probable that in former times either a living representative or an effigyof Balder was annually burned in them. Midsummer was the season sacred to Balder, and theSwedish poet Tegner, in placing the burning of Balder at midsummer, may very well have fol-lowed an old tradition that the summer solstice was the time when the good god came to hisuntimely end.Thus it has been shown that the leading incidents of the Balder myth have their counterpartsin those fire-festivals of our European peasantry which undoubtedly date from a time longprior to the introduction of Christianity. The pretence of throwing the victim chosen by lot intothe Beltane fire, and the similar treatment of the man, the future Green Wolf, at the midsum-mer bonfire in Normandy, may naturally be interpreted as traces of an older custom of actual-ly burning human beings on these occasions; and the green dress of the Green Wolf, coupledwith the leafy envelope of the young fellow who trod out the midsummer fire at Moosheim,seems to hint that the persons who perished at these festivals did so in the character of tree-spirits or deities of vegetation. From all this we may reasonably infer that in the Balder mython the one hand, and the fire-festivals and custom of gathering mistletoe on the other hand,we have, as it were, the two broken and dissevered halves of an original whole. In otherwords, we may assume with some degree of probability that the myth of Balder’s death wasnot merely a myth, that is, a description of physical phenomena in imagery borrowed fromhuman life, but that it was at the same time the story which people told to explain why theyannually burned a human representative of the god and cut the mistletoe with solemn cere-mony. If I am right, the story of Balder’s tragic end formed, so to say, the text of the sacreddrama which was acted year by year as a magical rite to cause the sun to shine, trees togrow, crops to thrive, and to guard man and beast from the baleful arts of fairies and trolls, ofwitches and warlocks. The tale belonged, in short, to that class of nature myths which aremeant to be supplemented by ritual; here, as so often, myth stood to magic in the relation oftheory to practice.Page 510"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"But if the victims—the human Balders—who died by fire, whether in spring or at midsummer,were put to death as living embodiments of tree-spirits or deities of vegetation, it would seemthat Balder himself must have been a tree-spirit or deity of vegetation. It becomes desirable,therefore, to determine, if we can, the particular kind of tree or trees, of which a personal rep-resentative was burned at the fire-festivals. For we may be quite sure that it was not as a rep-resentative of vegetation in general that the victim suffered death. The idea of vegetation ingeneral is too abstract to be primitive. Most probably the victim at first represented a particu-lar kind of sacred tree. But of all European trees none has such claims as the oak to be con-sidered as pre-eminently the sacred tree of the Aryans. We have seen that its worship isattested for all the great branches of the Aryan stock in Europe; hence we may certainly con-clude that the tree was venerated by the Aryans in common before the dispersion, and thattheir primitive home must have lain in a land which was clothed with forests of oak.Now, considering the primitive character and remarkable similarity of the fire-festivalsobserved by all the branches of the Aryan race in Europe, we may infer that these festivalsform part of the common stock of religious observances which the various peoples carriedwith them in their wanderings from their old home. But, if I am right, an essential feature ofthose primitive fire-festivals was the burning of a man who represented the tree-spirit. In view,then, of the place occupied by the oak in the religion of the Aryans, the presumption is thatthe tree so represented at the fire-festivals must originally have been the oak. So far as theCelts and Lithuanians are concerned, this conclusion will perhaps hardly be contested. Butboth for them and for the Germans it is confirmed by a remarkable piece of religious conser-vatism. The most primitive method known to man of producing fire is by rubbing two pieces ofwood against each other till they ignite; and we have seen that this method is still used inEurope for kindling sacred fires such as the need-fire, and that most probably it was formerlyresorted to at all the fire-festivals under discussion. Now it is sometimes required that theneed-fire, or other sacred fire, should be made by the friction of a particular kind of wood; andwhen the kind of wood is prescribed, whether among Celts, Germans, or Slavs, that woodappears to be generally the oak. But if the sacred fire was regularly kindled by the friction ofoak-wood, we may infer that originally the fire was also fed with the same material. In point offact, it appears that the perpetual fire of Vesta at Rome was fed with oak-wood, and that oak-wood was the fuel consumed in the perpetual fire which burned under the sacred oak at thegreat Lithuanian sanctuary of Romove. Further, that oak-wood was formerly the fuel burned inthe midsummer fires may perhaps be inferred from the custom, said to be still observed bypeasants in many mountain districts of Germany, of making up the cottage fire on MidsummerDay with a heavy block of oak-wood. The block is so arranged that it smoulders slowly and isnot finally reduced to charcoal till the expiry of a year. Then upon next Midsummer Day thecharred embers of the old log are removed to make room for the new one, and are mixedwith the seed-corn or scattered about the garden. This is believed to guard the food cookedon the hearth from witchcraft, to preserve the luck of the house, to promote the growth of thecrops, and to keep them from blight and vermin. Thus the custom is almost exactly parallel tothat of the Yule-log, which in parts of Germany, France, England, Serbia, and other Slavoniclands was commonly of oak-wood. The general conclusion is, that at those periodic or occa-sional ceremonies the ancient Aryans both kindled and fed the fire with the sacred oak-wood.But if at these solemn rites the fire was regularly made of oakwood, it follows that any manwho was burned in it as a personification of the tree-spirit could have represented no tree butthe oak. The sacred oak was thus burned in duplicate; the wood of the tree was consumed inthe fire, and along with it was consumed a living man as a personification of the oak-spirit.The conclusion thus drawn for the European Aryans in general is confirmed in its specialPage 511"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"application to the Scandinavians by the relation in which amongst them the mistletoe appearsto have stood to the burning of the victim in the midsummer fire. We have seen that amongScandinavians it has been customary to gather the mistletoe at midsummer. But so far asappears on the face of this custom, there is nothing to connect it with the midsummer fires inwhich human victims or effigies of them were burned. Even if the fire, as seems probable,was originally always made with oak-wood, why should it have been necessary to pull themistletoe? The last link between the midsummer customs of gathering the mistletoe and light-ing the bonfires is supplied by Balder’s myth, which can hardly be disjoined from the customsin question. The myth suggests that a vital connexion may once have been believed to sub-sist between the mistletoe and the human representative of the oak who was burned in thefire. According to the myth, Balder could be killed by nothing in heaven or earth except themistletoe; and so long as the mistletoe remained on the oak, he was not only immortal butinvulnerable. Now, if we suppose that Balder was the oak, the origin of the myth becomesintelligible. The mistletoe was viewed as the seat of life of the oak, and so long as it was unin-jured nothing could kill or even wound the oak. The conception of the mistletoe as the seat oflife of the oak would naturally be suggested to primitive people by the observation that whilethe oak is deciduous, the mistletoe which grows on it is evergreen. In winter the sight of itsfresh foliage among the bare branches must have been hailed by the worshippers of the treeas a sign that the divine life which had ceased to animate the branches yet survived in themistletoe, as the heart of a sleeper still beats when his body is motionless. Hence when thegod had to be killed—when the sacred tree had to be burnt—it was necessary to begin bybreaking off the mistletoe. For so long as the mistletoe remained intact, the oak (so peoplemight think) was invulnerable; all the blows of their knives and axes would glance harmlessfrom its surface. But once tear from the oak its sacred heart—the mistletoe—and the treenodded to its fall. And when in later times the spirit of the oak came to be represented by aliving man, it was logically necessary to suppose that, like the tree he personated, he couldneither be killed nor wounded so long as the mistletoe remained uninjured. The pulling of themistletoe was thus at once the signal and the cause of his death.On this view the invulnerable Balder is neither more nor less than a personification of amistletoe-bearing oak. The interpretation is confirmed by what seems to have been anancient Italian belief, that the mistletoe can be destroyed neither by fire nor water; for if theparasite is thus deemed indestructible, it might easily be supposed to communicate its ownindestructibility to the tree on which it grows, so long as the two remain in conjunction. Or, toput the same idea in mythical form, we might tell how the kindly god of the oak had his lifesecurely deposited in the imperishable mistletoe which grew among the branches; howaccordingly so long as the mistletoe kept its place there, the deity himself remained invulnera-ble; and how at last a cunning foe, let into the secret of the god’s invulnerability, tore themistletoe from the oak, thereby killing the oak-god and afterwards burning his body in a firewhich could have made no impression on him so long as the incombustible parasite retainedits seat among the boughs.But since the idea of a being whose life is thus, in a sense, outside himself, must be strangeto many readers, and has, indeed, not yet been recognised in its full bearing on primitivesuperstition, it will be worth while to illustrate it by examples drawn both from story and cus-tom. The result will be to show that, in assuming this idea as the explanation of Balder’s rela-tion to the mistletoe, I assume a principle which is deeply engraved on the mind of primitiveman.Chapter LXVIPage 512"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"The External Soul in Folk-TalesIN a former part of this work we saw that, in the opinion of primitive people, the soul may tem-porarily absent itself from the body without causing death. Such temporary absences of thesoul are often believed to involve considerable risk, since the wandering soul is liable to avariety of mishaps at the hands of enemies, and so forth. But there is another aspect to thispower of disengaging the soul from the body. If only the safety of the soul can be ensuredduring its absence, there is no reason why the soul should not continue absent for an indefi-nite time; indeed a man may, on a pure calculation of personal safety, desire that his soulshould never return to his body. Unable to conceive of life abstractly as a “permanent possi-bility of sensation” or a “continuous adjustment of internal arrangements to external relations,”the savage thinks of it as a concrete material thing of a definite bulk, capable of being seenand handled, kept in a box or jar, and liable to be bruised, fractured, or smashed in pieces. Itis not needful that the life, so conceived, should be in the man; it may be absent from hisbody and still continue to animate him by virtue of a sort of sympathy or action at a distance.So long as this object which he calls his life or soul remains unharmed, the man is well; if it isinjured, he suffers; if it is destroyed, he dies. Or, to put it otherwise, when a man is ill or dies,the fact is explained by saying that the material object called his life or soul, whether it be inhis body or out of it, has either sustained injury or been destroyed. But there may be circum-stances in which, if the life or soul remains in the man, it stands a greater chance of sustain-ing injury than if it were stowed away in some safe and secret place. Accordingly, in such cir-cumstances, primitive man takes his soul out of his body and deposits it for security in somesnug spot, intending to replace it in his body when the danger is past. Or if he should discov-er some place of absolute security, he may be content to leave his soul there permanently.The advantage of this is that, so long as the soul remains unharmed in the place where hehas deposited it, the man himself is immortal; nothing can kill his body, since his life is not init.Evidence of this primitive belief is furnished by a class of folk-tales of which the Norse story of“The giant who had no heart in his body” is perhaps the best-known example. Stories of thiskind are widely diffused over the world, and from their number and the variety of incident andof details in which the leading idea is embodied, we may infer that the conception of an exter-nal soul is one which has had a powerful hold on the minds of men at an early stage of histo-ry. For folk-tales are a faithful reflection of the world as it appeared to the primitive mind; andwe may be sure that any idea which commonly occurs in them, however absurd it may seemto us, must once have been an ordinary article of belief. This assurance, so far as it concernsthe supposed power of disengaging the soul from the body for a longer or shorter time, isamply corroborated by a comparison of the folk-tales in question with the actual beliefs andpractices of savages. To this we shall return after some specimens of the tales have beengiven. The specimens will be selected with a view of illustrating both the characteristic fea-tures and the wide diffusion of this class of tales.In the first place, the story of the external soul is told, in various forms, by all Aryan peoplesfrom Hindoostan to the Hebrides. A very common form of it is this: A warlock, giant, or otherfairyland being is invulnerable and immortal because he keeps his soul hidden far away insome secret place; but a fair princess, whom he holds enthralled in his enchanted castle,wiles his secret from him and reveals it to the hero, who seeks out the warlock’s soul, heart,life, or death (as it is variously called), and by destroying it, simultaneously kills the warlock.Thus a Hindoo story tells how a magician called Punchkin held a queen captive for twelveyears, and would fain marry her, but she would not have him. At last the queen’s son came toPage 513"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"rescue her, and the two plotted together to kill Punchkin. So the queen spoke the magicianfair, and pretended that she had at last made up her mind to marry him. “And do tell me,” shesaid, “are you quite immortal? Can death never touch you? And are you too great anenchanter ever to feel human suffering?” “It is true,” he said, “that I am not as others. Far, faraway, hundreds of thousands of miles from this, there lies a desolate country covered withthick jungle. In the midst of the jungle grows a circle of palm trees, and in the centre of thecircle stand six chattees full of water, piled one above another: below the sixth chattee is asmall cage, which contains a little green parrot;—on the life of the parrot depends my life;—and if the parrot is killed I must die. It is, however,” he added, “impossible that the parrotshould sustain any injury, both on account of the inaccessibility of the country, and because,by my appointment, many thousand genii surround the palm trees, and kill all who approachthe place.” But the queen’s young son overcame all difficulties, and got possession of the par-rot. He brought it to the door of the magician’s palace, and began playing with it. Punchkin,the magician, saw him, and, coming out, tried to persuade the boy to give him the parrot.“Give me my parrot!” cried Punchkin. Then the boy took hold of the parrot and tore off one ofhis wings; and as he did so the magician’s right arm fell off. Punchkin then stretched out hisleft arm, crying, “Give me my parrot!” The prince pulled off the parrot’s second wing, and themagician’s left arm tumbled off. “Give me my parrot!” cried he, and fell on his knees. Theprince pulled off the parrot’s right leg, the magician’s right leg fell off; the prince pulled off theparrot’s left leg, down fell the magician’s left. Nothing remained of him except the trunk andthe head; but still he rolled his eyes, and cried, “Give me my parrot!” “Take your parrot, then,”cried the boy; and with that he wrung the bird’s neck, and threw it at the magician; and, as hedid so, Punchkin’s head twisted round, and, with a fearful groan, he died! In another Hindootale an ogre is asked by his daughter, “Papa, where do you keep your soul?” “Sixteen milesaway from this place,” he said, “is a tree. Round the tree are tigers, and bears, and scorpions,and snakes; on the top of the tree is a very great fat snake; on his head is a little cage; in thecage is a bird; and my soul is in that bird.” The end of the ogre is like that of the magician inthe previous tale. As the bird’s wings and legs are torn off, the ogre’s arms and legs drop off;and when its neck is wrung he falls down dead. In a Bengalee story it is said that all theogres dwell in Ceylon, and that all their lives are in a single lemon. A boy cuts the lemon inpieces, and all the ogres die.In a Siamese or Cambodian story, probably derived from India, we are told that Thossakan orRavana, the King of Ceylon, was able by magic art to take his soul out of his body and leaveit in a box at home, while he went to the wars. Thus he was invulnerable in battle. When hewas about to give battle to Rama, he deposited his soul with a hermit called Fire-eye, whowas to keep it safe for him. So in the fight Rama was astounded to see that his arrows struckthe king without wounding him. But one of Rama’s allies, knowing the secret of the king’sinvulnerability, transformed himself by magic into the likeness of the king, and going to thehermit asked back his soul. On receiving it he soared up into the air and flew to Rama, bran-dishing the box and squeezing it so hard that all the breath left the King of Ceylon’s body, andhe died. In a Bengalee story a prince going into a far country planted with his own hands atree in the courtyard of his father’s palace, and said to his parents, “This tree is my life. Whenyou see the tree green and fresh, then know that it is well with me; when you see the treefade in some parts, then know that I am in an ill case; and when you see the whole tree fade,then know that I am dead and gone.” In another Indian tale a prince, setting forth on his trav-els, left behind him a barley plant, with instructions that it should be carefully tended andwatched; for if it flourished, he would be alive and well, but if it drooped, then some mis-chance was about to happen to him. And so it fell out. For the prince was beheaded, and ashis head rolled off, the barley plant snapped in two and the ear of barley fell to the ground.Page 514"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"In Greek tales, ancient and modern, the idea of an external soul is not uncommon. WhenMeleager was seven days old, the Fates appeared to his mother and told her that Meleagerwould die when the brand which was blazing on the hearth had burnt down. So his mothersnatched the brand from the fire and kept it in a box. But in after-years, being enraged at herson for slaying her brothers, she burnt the brand in the fire and Meleager expired in agonies,as if flames were preying on his vitals. Again, Nisus King of Megara had a purple or goldenhair on the middle of his head, and it was fated that whenever the hair was pulled out the kingshould die. When Megara was besieged by the Cretans, the king’s daughter Scylla fell in lovewith Minos, their king, and pulled out the fatal hair from her father’s head. So he died. In amodern Greek folk-tale a man’s strength lies in three golden hairs on his head. When hismother pulls them out, he grows weak and timid and is slain by his enemies. In another mod-ern Greek story the life of an enchanter is bound up with three doves which are in the belly ofa wild boar. When the first dove is killed, the magician grows sick; when the second is killed,he grows very sick; and when the third is killed, he dies. In another Greek story of the samesort an ogre’s strength is in three singing birds which are in a wild boar. The hero kills two ofthe birds, and then coming to the ogre’s house finds him lying on the ground in great pain. Heshows the third bird to the ogre, who begs that the hero will either let it fly away or give it tohim to eat. But the hero wrings the bird’s neck, and the ogre dies on the spot.In a modern Roman version of “Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp,” the magician tells theprincess, whom he holds captive in a floating rock in mid-ocean, that he will never die. Theprincess reports this to the prince her husband, who has come to rescue her. The princereplies, “It is impossible but that there should be some one thing or other that is fatal to him;ask him what that one fatal thing is.” So the princess asked the magician, and he told her thatin the wood was a hydra with seven heads; in the middle head of the hydra was a leveret, inthe head of the leveret was a bird, in the bird’s head was a precious stone, and if this stonewere put under his pillow he would die. The prince procured the stone, and the princess laid itunder the magician’s pillow. No sooner did the enchanter lay his head on the pillow than hegave three terrible yells, turned himself round and round three times, and died.Stories of the same sort are current among Slavonic peoples. Thus a Russian story tells howa warlock called Koshchei the Deathless carried off a princess and kept her prisoner in hisgolden castle. However, a prince made up to her one day as she was walking alone and dis-consolate in the castle garden, and cheered by the prospect of escaping with him she went tothe warlock and coaxed him with false and flattering words, saying, “My dearest friend, tellme, I pray you, will you never die?” “Certainly not,” says he. “Well,” says she, “and where isyour death? is it in your dwelling?” “To be sure it is,” says he, “it is in the broom under thethreshold.” Thereupon the princess seized the broom and threw it on the fire, but although thebroom burned, the deathless Koshchei remained alive; indeed not so much as a hair of himwas singed. Balked in her first attempt, the artful hussy pouted and said, “You do not love metrue, for you have not told me where your death is; yet I am not angry, but love you with allmy heart.” With these fawning words she besought the warlock to tell her truly where hisdeath was. So he laughed and said, “Why do you wish to know? Well then, out of love I willtell you where it lies. In a certain field there stand three green oaks, and under the roots ofthe largest oak is a worm, and if ever this worm is found and crushed, that instant I shall die.”When the princess heard these words, she went straight to her lover and told him all; and hesearched till he found the oaks and dug up the worm and crushed it. Then he hurried to thewarlock’s castle, but only to learn from the princess that the warlock was still alive. Then shefell to wheedling and coaxing Koshchei once more, and this time, overcome by her wiles, hePage 515"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"opened his heart to her and told her the truth. “My death,” said he, “is far from here and hardto find, on the wide ocean. In that sea is an island, and on the island there grows a greenoak, and beneath the oak is an iron chest, and in the chest is a small basket, and in the bas-ket is a hare, and in the hare is a duck, and in the duck is an egg; and he who finds the eggand breaks it, kills me at the same time.” The prince naturally procured the fateful egg andwith it in his hands he confronted the deathless warlock. The monster would have killed him,but the prince began to squeeze the egg. At that the warlock shrieked with pain, and turningto the false princess, who stood by smirking and smiling, “Was it not out of love for you,” saidhe, “that I told you where my death was? And is this the return you make to me?” With thathe grabbed at his sword, which hung from a peg on the wall; but before he could reach it, theprince had crushed the egg, and sure enough the deathless warlock found his death at thesame moment. “In one of the descriptions of Koshchei’s death, he is said to be killed by ablow on the forehead inflicted by the mysterious egg—that last link in the magic chain bywhich his life is darkly bound. In another version of the same story, but told of a snake, thefatal blow is struck by a small stone found in the yolk of an egg, which is inside a duck, whichis inside a hare, which is inside a stone, which is on an island.”Amongst peoples of the Teutonic stock stories of the external soul are not wanting. In a taletold by the Saxons of Transylvania it is said that a young man shot at a witch again andagain. The bullets went clean through her but did her no harm, and she only laughed andmocked at him. “Silly earthworm,” she cried, “shoot as much as you like. It does me no harm.For know that my life resides not in me but far, far away. In a mountain is a pond, on the pondswims a duck, in the duck is an egg, in the egg burns a light, that light is my life. If you couldput out that light, my life would be at an end. But that can never, never be.” However, theyoung man got hold of the egg, smashed it, and put out the light, and with it the witch’s lifewent out also. In a German story a cannibal called Body without Soul or Soulless keeps hissoul in a box, which stands on a rock in the middle of the Red Sea. A soldier gets possessionof the box and goes with it to Soulless, who begs the soldier to give him back his soul. Butthe soldier opens the box, takes out the soul, and flings it backward over his head. At thesame moment the cannibal drops dead to the ground.In another German story and old warlock lives with a damsel all alone in the midst of a vastand gloomy wood. She fears that being old he may die and leave her alone in the forest. Buthe reassures her. “Dear child,” he said, “I cannot die, and I have no heart in my breast.” Butshe importuned him to tell her where his heart was. So he said, “Far, far from here in anunknown and lonesome land stands a great church. The church is well secured with irondoors, and round about it flows a broad deep moat. In the church flies a bird and in the bird ismy heart. So long as the bird lives, I live. It cannot die of itself, and no one can catch it; there-fore I cannot die, and you need have no anxiety.” However the young man, whose bride thedamsel was to have been before the warlock spirited her away, contrived to reach the churchand catch the bird. He brought it to the damsel, who stowed him and it away under the war-lock’s bed. Soon the old warlock came home. He was ailing, and said so. The girl wept andsaid, “Alas, daddy is dying; he has a heart in his breast after all.” “Child,” replied the warlock,“hold your tongue. I can’t die. It will soon pass over.” At that the young man under the bedgave the bird a gentle squeeze; and as he did so, the old warlock felt very unwell and satdown. Then the young man gripped the bird tighter, and the warlock fell senseless from hischair. “Now squeeze him dead,” cried the damsel. Her lover obeyed, and when the bird wasdead, the old warlock also lay dead on the floor.In the Norse tale of “the giant who had no heart in his body,” the giant tells the captivePage 516"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"princess, “Far, far away in a lake lies an island, on that island stands a church, in that churchis a well, in that well swims a duck, in that duck there is an egg, and in that egg there lies myheart.” The hero of the tale, with the help of some animals to whom he had been kind, obtainsthe egg and squeezes it, at which the giant screams piteously and begs for his life. But thehero breaks the egg in pieces and the giant at once bursts. In another Norse story a hill-ogretells the captive princess that she will never be able to return home unless she finds the grainof sand which lies under the ninth tongue of the ninth head of a certain dragon; but if thatgrain of sand were to come over the rock in which the ogres live, they would all burst “and therock itself would become a gilded palace, and the lake green meadows.” The hero finds thegrain of sand and takes it to the top of the high rock in which the ogres live. So all the ogresburst and the rest falls out as one of the ogres had foretold.In a Celtic tale, recorded in the West Highlands of Scotland, a giant is questioned by a cap-tive queen as to where he keeps his soul. At last, after deceiving her several times, he con-fides to her the fatal secret: “There is great flagstone under the threshold. There is a wetherunder the flag. There is a duck in the wether’s belly, and an egg in the belly of the duck, andit is in the egg that my soul is.” On the morrow when the giant was gone, the queen contrivedto get possession of the egg and crushed it in her hands, and at that very moment the giant,who was coming home in the dusk, fell down dead. In another Celtic tale, a sea beast hascarried off a king’s daughter, and an old smith declares that there is no way of killing thebeast but one. “In the island that is in the midst of the loch is Eillid Chaisfhion—the white-foot-ed hind, of the slenderest legs, and the swiftest step, and though she should be caught, therewould spring a hoodie out of her, and though the hoodie should be caught, there would springa trout out of her, but there is an egg in the mouth of the trout, and the soul of the beast is inthe egg, and if the egg breaks, the beast is dead.” As usual the egg is broken and the beastdies.In an Irish story we read how a giant kept a beautiful damsel a prisoner in his castle on thetop of a hill, which was white with the bones of the champions who had tried in vain to rescuethe fair captive. At last the hero, after hewing and slashing at the giant all to no purpose, dis-covered that the only way to kill him was to rub a mole on the giant’s right breast with a cer-tain egg, which was in a duck, which was in a chest, which lay locked and bound at the bot-tom of the sea. With the help of some obliging animals, the hero made himself master of theprecious egg and slew the giant by merely striking it against the mole on his right breast.Similarly in a Breton story there figures a giant whom neither fire nor water nor steel canharm. He tells his seventh wife, whom he has just married after murdering all her predeces-sors, “I am immortal, and no one can hurt me unless he crushes on my breast an egg, whichis in a pigeon, which is in the belly of a hare; this hare is in the belly of a wolf, and this wolf isin the belly of my brother, who dwells a thousand leagues from here. So I am quite easy onthat score.” A soldier contrived to obtain the egg and crush it on the breast of the giant, whoimmediately expired. In another Breton tale the life of a giant resides in an old box-tree whichgrows in his castle garden; and to kill him it is necessary to sever the tap-root of the tree at asingle blow of an axe without injuring any of the lesser roots. This task the hero, as usual,successfully accomplishes, and at the same moment the giant drops dead.The notion of an external soul has now been traced in folk-tales told by Aryan peoples fromIndia to Ireland. We have still to show that the same idea occurs commonly in the popularstories of peoples who do not belong to the Aryan stock. In the ancient Egyptian tale of “TheTwo Brothers,” which was written down in the reign of Rameses II., about 1300 B.C., we readhow one of the brothers enchanted his heart and placed it in the flower of an acacia tree, andPage 517"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"how, when the flower was cut at the instigation of his wife, he immediately fell down dead, butrevived when his brother found the lost heart in the berry of the acacia and threw it into a cupof fresh water.In the story of Seyf el-Mulook in the Arabian Nights the jinnee tells the captive daughter of theKing of India, “When I was born, the astrologers declared that the destruction of my soulwould be effected by the hand of one of the sons of the human kings. I therefore took mysoul, and put it into the crop of a sparrow, and I imprisoned the sparrow in a little box, and putthis into another small box, and this I put within seven other small boxes, and I put thesewithin seven chests, and the chests I put into a coffer of marble within the verge of this cir-cumambient ocean; for this part is remote from the countries of mankind, and none ofmankind can gain access to it.” But Seyf el-Mulook got possession of the sparrow and stran-gled it, and the jinnee fell upon the ground a heap of black ashes. In a Kabyle story an ogredeclares that his fate is far away in an egg, which is in a pigeon, which is in a camel, which isin the sea. The hero procures the egg and crushes it between his hands, and the ogre dies.In a Magyar folk-tale, an old witch detains a young prince called Ambrose in the bowels of theearth. At last she confided to him that she kept a wild boar in a silken meadow, and if it werekilled, they would find a hare inside, and inside the hare a pigeon, and inside the pigeon asmall box, and inside the box one black and one shining beetle: the shining beetle held herlife, and the black one held her power; if these two beetles died, then her life would come toan end also. When the old hag went out, Ambrose killed the wild boar, and took out the hare;from the hare he took the pigeon, from the pigeon the box, and from the box the two beetles;he killed the black beetle, but kept the shining one alive. So the witch’s power left her immedi-ately, and when she came home, she had to take to her bed. Having learned from her how toescape from his prison to the upper air, Ambrose killed the shining beetle, and the old hag’sspirit left her at once. In a Kalmuck tale we read how a certain khan challenged a wise man toshow his skill by stealing a precious stone on which the khan’s life depended. The sage con-trived to purloin the talisman while the khan and his guards slept; but not content with this hegave a further proof of his dexterity by bonneting the slumbering potentate with a bladder.This was too much for the khan. Next morning he informed the sage that he could overlookeverything else, but that the indignity of being bonneted with a bladder was more than hecould bear; and he ordered his facetious friend to instant execution. Pained at this exhibitionof royal ingratitude, the sage dashed to the ground the talisman which he still held in hishand; and at the same instant blood flowed from the nostrils of the khan, and he gave up theghost.In a Tartar poem two heroes named Ak Molot and Bulat engage in mortal combat. Ak Molotpierces his foe through and through with an arrow, grapples with him, and dashes him to theground, but all in vain, Bulat could not die. At last when the combat has lasted three years, afriend of Ak Molot sees a golden casket hanging by a white thread from the sky, and bethinkshim that perhaps this casket contains Bulat’s soul. So he shot through the white thread withan arrow, and down fell the casket. He opened it, and in the casket sat ten white birds, andone of the birds was Bulat’s soul. Bulat wept when he saw that his soul was found in the cas-ket. But one after the other the birds were killed, and then Ak Molot easily slew his foe. Inanother Tartar poem, two brothers going to fight two other brothers take out their souls andhide them in the form of a white herb with six stalks in a deep pit. But one of their foes seesthem doing so and digs up their souls, which he puts into a golden ram’s horn, and thensticks the ram’s horn in his quiver. The two warriors whose souls have thus been stolen knowthat they have no chance of victory, and accordingly make peace with their enemies. Inanother Tartar poem a terrible demon sets all the gods and heroes at defiance. At last aPage 518"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"valiant youth fights the demon, binds him hand and foot, and slices him with his sword. Butstill the demon is not slain. So the youth asked him, “Tell me, where is your soul hidden? Forif your soul had been hidden in your body, you must have been dead long ago.” The demonreplied, “On the saddle of my horse is a bag. In the bag is a serpent with twelve heads. In theserpent is my soul. When you have killed the serpent, you have killed me also.” So the youthtook the saddle-bag from the horse and killed the twelve-headed serpent, whereupon thedemon expired. In another Tartar poem a hero called Kök Chan deposits with a maiden agolden ring, in which is half his strength. Afterwards when Kök Chan is wrestling long with ahero and cannot kill him, a woman drops into his mouth the ring which contains half hisstrength. Thus inspired with fresh force he slays his enemy.In a Mongolian story the hero Joro gets the better of his enemy the lama Tschoridong in thefollowing way. The lama, who is an enchanter, sends out his soul in the form of a wasp tosting Joro’s eyes. But Joro catches the wasp in his hand, and by alternately shutting andopening his hand he causes the lama alternately to lose and recover consciousness. In aTartar poem two youths cut open the body of an old witch and tear out her bowels, but all tono purpose, she still lives. On being asked where her soul is, she answers that it is in themiddle of her shoe-sole in the form of a seven-headed speckled snake. So one of the youthsslices her shoe-sole with his sword, takes out the speckled snake, and cuts off its sevenheads. Then the witch dies. Another Tartar poem describes how the hero Kartaga grappledwith the Swan-woman. Long they wrestled. Moons waxed and waned and still they wrestled;years came and went, and still the struggle went on. But the piebald horse and the blackhorse knew that the Swan-woman’s soul was not in her. Under the black earth flow nine seas;where the seas meet and form one, the sea comes to the surface of the earth. At the mouthof the nine seas rises a rock of copper; it rises to the surface of the ground, it rises upbetween heaven and earth, this rock of copper. At the foot of the copper rock is a black chest,in the black chest is a golden casket, and in the golden casket is the soul of the Swan-woman. Seven little birds are the soul of the Swan-woman; if the birds are killed the Swan-woman will die straightway. So the horses ran to the foot of the copper rock, opened theblack chest, and brought back the golden casket. Then the piebald horse turned himself intoa bald-headed man, opened the golden casket, and cut off the heads of the seven birds. Sothe Swan-woman died. In another Tartar poem the hero, pursuing his sister who has drivenaway his cattle, is warned to desist from the pursuit because his sister has carried away hissoul in a golden sword and a golden arrow, and if he pursues her she will kill him by throwingthe golden sword or shooting the golden arrow at him.AMalay poem relates how once upon a time in the city of Indrapoora there was a certainmerchant who was rich and prosperous, but he had no children. One day as he walked withhis wife by the river they found a baby girl, fair as an angel. So they adopted the child andcalled her Bidasari. The merchant caused a golden fish to be made, and into this fish hetransferred the soul of his adopted daughter. Then he put the golden fish in a golden box fullof water, and hid it in a pond in the midst of his garden. In time the girl grew to be a lovelywoman. Now the King of Indrapoora had a fair young queen, who lived in fear that the kingmight take to himself a second wife. So, hearing of the charms of Bidasari, the queenresolved to put her out of the way. She lured the girl to the palace and tortured her cruelly;but Bidasari could not die, because her soul was not in her. At last she could stand the tortureno longer and said to the queen, “If you wish me to die, you must bring the box which is inthe pond in my father’s garden.” So the box was brought and opened, and there was thegolden fish in the water. The girl said, “My soul is in that fish. In the morning you must takethe fish out of the water, and in the evening you must put it back into the water. Do not let thePage 519"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"fish lie about, but bind it round your neck. If you do this, I shall soon die.” So the queen tookthe fish out of the box and fastened it round her neck; and no sooner had she done so thanBidasari fell into a swoon. But in the evening, when the fish was put back into the water,Bidasari came to herself again. Seeing that she thus had the girl in her power, the queen senther home to her adopted parents. To save her from further persecution her parents resolvedto remove their daughter from the city. So in a lonely and desolate spot they built a house andbrought Bidasari thither. There she dwelt alone, undergoing vicissitudes that correspondedwith the vicissitudes of the golden fish in which was her soul. All day long, while the fish wasout of the water, she remained unconscious; but in the evening, when the fish was put intothe water, she revived. One day the king was out hunting, and coming to the house whereBidasari lay unconscious, was smitten with her beauty. He tried to waken her, but in vain.Next day, towards evening, he repeated his visit, but still found her unconscious. However,when darkness fell, she came to herself and told the king the secret of her life. So the kingreturned to the palace, took the fish from the queen, and put it in water. Immediately Bidasarirevived, and the king took her to wife.Another story of an external soul comes from Nias, an island to the west of Sumatra. Once ona time a chief was captured by his enemies, who tried to put him to death but failed. Waterwould not drown him nor fire burn him nor steel pierce him. At last his wife revealed thesecret. On his head he had a hair as hard as a copper wire; and with this wire his life wasbound up. So the hair was plucked out, and with it his spirit fled.AWest African story from Southern Nigeria relates how a king kept his soul in a little brownbird, which perched on a tall tree beside the gate of the palace. The king’s life was so boundup with that of the bird that whoever should kill the bird would simultaneously kill the king andsucceed to the kingdom. The secret was betrayed by the queen to her lover, who shot thebird with an arrow and thereby slew the king and ascended the vacant throne. A tale told bythe Ba-Ronga of South Africa sets forth how the lives of a whole family were contained in onecat. When a girl of the family, named Titishan, married a husband, she begged her parents tolet her take the precious cat with her to her new home. But they refused, saying, “You knowthat our life is attached to it”; and they offered to give her an antelope or even an elephantinstead of it. But nothing would satisfy her but the cat. So at last she carried it off with her andshut it up in a place where nobody saw it; even her husband knew nothing about it. One day,when she went to work in the fields, the cat escaped from its place of concealment, enteredthe hut, put on the warlike trappings of the husband, and danced and sang. Some children,attracted by the noise, discovered the cat at its antics, and when they expressed their aston-ishment, the animal only capered the more and insulted them besides. So they went to theowner and said, “There is somebody dancing in your house, and he insulted us.” “Hold yourtongues,” said he, “I’ll soon put a stop to your lies.” So he went and hid behind the door andpeeped in, and there sure enough was the cat prancing about and singing. He fired at it, andthe animal dropped down dead. At the same moment his wife fell to the ground in the fieldwhere she was at work; said she, “I have been killed at home.” But she had strength enoughleft to ask her husband to go with her to her parents’ village, taking with him the dead catwrapt up in a mat. All her relatives assembled, and bitterly they reproached her for havinginsisted on taking the animal with her to her husband’s village. As soon as the mat wasunrolled and they saw the dead cat, they all fell down lifeless one after the other. So the Clanof the Cat was destroyed; and the bereaved husband closed the gate of the village with abranch, and returned home, and told his friends how in killing the cat he had killed the wholeclan, because their lives depended on the life of the cat.Page 520"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"Ideas of the same sort meet us in stories told by the North American Indians. Thus theNavajoes tell of a certain mythical being called “the Maiden that becomes a Bear,” wholearned the art of turning herself into a bear from the prairie wolf. She was a great warrior andquite invulnerable; for when she went to war she took out her vital organs and hid them, sothat no one could kill her; and when the battle was over she put the organs back in theirplaces again. The Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia tell of an ogress, who could not bekilled because her life was in a hemlock branch. A brave boy met her in the woods, smashedher head with a stone, scattered her brains, broke her bones, and threw them into the water.Then, thinking he had disposed of the ogress, he went into her house. There he saw awoman rooted to the floor, who warned him, saying, “Now do not stay long. I know that youhave tried to kill the ogress. It is the fourth time that somebody has tried to kill her. She neverdies; she has nearly come to life. There in that covered hemlock branch is her life. Go there,and as soon as you see her enter, shoot her life. Then she will be dead.” Hardly had she fin-ished speaking when sure enough in came the ogress, singing as she walked. But the boyshot at her life, and she fell dead to the floor.Chapter LXVIIThe External Soul in Folk-Custom1. THE EXTERNAL SOUL IN INANIMATE THINGSTHUS the idea that the soul may be deposited for a longer or shorter time in some place ofsecurity outside the body, or at all events in the hair, is found in the popular tales of manyraces. It remains to show that the idea is not a mere figment devised to adorn a tale, but is areal article of primitive faith, which has given rise to a corresponding set of customs.We have seen that in the tales the hero, as a preparation for battle, sometimes removes hissoul from his body, in order that his body may be invulnerable and immortal in the combat.With a like intention the savage removes his soul from his body on various occasions of realor imaginary peril. Thus among the people of Minahassa in Celebes, when a family movesinto a new house, a priest collects the souls of the whole family in a bag, and afterwardsrestores them to their owners, because the moment of entering a new house is supposed tobe fraught with supernatural danger. In Southern Celebes, when a woman is brought to bed,the messenger who fetches the doctor or the midwife always carries with him somethingmade of iron, such as a chopping-knife, which he delivers to the doctor. The doctor must keepthe thing in his house till the confinement is over, when he gives it back, receiving a fixed sumof money for doing so. The chopping-knife, or whatever it is, represents the woman’s soul,which at this critical time is believed to be safer out of her body than in it. Hence the doctormust take great care of the object; for were it lost, the woman’s soul would assuredly, theythink, be lost with it.Among the Dyaks of Pinoeh, a district of South-eastern Borneo, when a child is born, a medi-cine-man is sent for, who conjures the soul of the infant into half a coco-nut, which he there-upon covers with a cloth and places on a square platter or charger suspended by cords fromthe roof. This ceremony he repeats at every new moon for a year. The intention of the cere-mony is not explained by the writer who describes it, but we may conjecture that it is to placethe soul of the child in a safer place than its own frail little body. This conjecture is confirmedby the reason assigned for a similar custom observed elsewhere in the Indian Archipelago. Inthe Kei Islands, when there is a newly-born child in a house, an empty coco-nut, split andspliced together again, may sometimes be seen hanging beside a rough wooden image of anPage 521"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"ancestor. The soul of the infant is believed to be temporarily deposited in the coco-nut inorder that it may be safe from the attacks of evil spirits; but when the child grows bigger andstronger, the soul will take up its permanent abode in its own body. Similarly among theEsquimaux of Alaska, when a child is sick, the medicine-man will sometimes extract its soulfrom its body and place it for safe-keeping in an amulet, which for further security he depositsin his own medicine-bag. It seems probable that many amulets have been similarly regardedas soul-boxes, that is, as safes in which the souls of the owners are kept for greater security.An old Mang’anje woman in the West Shire district of British Central Africa used to wearround her neck an ivory ornament, hollow, and about three inches long, which she called herlife or soul. Naturally, she would not part with it; a planter tried to buy it of her, but in vain.When Mr. James Macdonald was one day sitting in the house of a Hlubi chief, awaiting theappearance of that great man, who was busy decorating his person, a native pointed to a pairof magnificent ox-horns, and said, “Ntame has his soul in these horns.” The horns were thoseof an animal which had been sacrificed, and they were held sacred. A magician had fastenedthem to the roof to protect the house and its inmates from the thunder-bolt. “The idea,” addsMr. Macdonald, “is in no way foreign to South African thought. A man’s soul there may dwellin the roof of his house, in a tree, by a spring of water, or on some mountain scaur.” Amongthe natives of the Gazelle Peninsula in New Britain there is a secret society which goes bythe name of Ingniet or Ingiet. On his entrance into it every man receives a stone in the shapeeither of a human being or of an animal, and henceforth his soul is believed to be knit up in amanner with the stone. If it breaks, it is an evil omen for him; they say that the thunder hasstruck the stone and that he who owns it will soon die. If nevertheless the man survives thebreaking of his soul-stone, they say that it was not a proper soul-stone and he gets a newone instead. The emperor Romanus Lecapenus was once informed by an astronomer thatthe life of Simeon, prince of Bulgaria, was bound up with a certain column in Constantinople,so that if the capital of the column were removed, Simeon would immediately die. The emper-or took the hint and removed the capital, and at the same hour, as the emperor learned byenquiry, Simeon died of heart disease in Bulgaria.Again, we have seen that in folk-tales a man’s soul or strength is sometimes represented asbound up with his hair, and that when his hair is cut off he dies or grows weak. So the nativesof Amboyna used to think that their strength was in their hair and would desert them if it wereshorn. A criminal under torture in a Dutch Court of that island persisted in denying his guilt tillhis hair was cut off, when he immediately confessed. One man, who was tried for murder,endured without flinching the utmost ingenuity of his torturers till he saw the surgeon standingwith a pair of shears. On asking what this was for, and being told that it was to cut his hair, hebegged they would not do it, and made a clean breast. In subsequent cases, when torturefailed to wring a confession from a prisoner, the Dutch authorities made a practice of cuttingoff his hair.Here in Europe it used to be thought that the maleficent powers of witches and wizardsresided in their hair, and that nothing could make any impression on the miscreants so longas they kept their hair on. Hence in France it was customary to shave the whole bodies ofpersons charged with sorcery before handing them over to the torturer. Millaeus witnessedthe torture of some persons at Toulouse, from whom no confession could be wrung until theywere stripped and completely shaven, when they readily acknowledged the truth of thecharge. A woman also, who apparently led a pious life, was put to the torture on suspicion ofwitchcraft, and bore her agonies with incredible constancy, until complete depilation drove herto admit her guilt. The noted inquisitor Sprenger contented himself with shaving the head ofthe suspected witch or wizard; but his more thoroughgoing colleague Cumanus shaved thePage 522"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"whole bodies of forty-seven women before committing them all to the flames. He had highauthority for this rigorous scrutiny, since Satan himself, in a sermon preached from the pulpitof North Berwick church, comforted his many servants by assuring them that no harm couldbefall them “sa lang as their hair wes on, and sould newir latt ane teir fall fra thair ene.”Similarly in Bastar, a province of India, “if a man is adjudged guilty of witchcraft, he is beatenby the crowd, his hair is shaved, the hair being supposed to constitute his power of mischief,his front teeth are knocked out, in order, it is said, to prevent him from muttering incanta-tions.... Women suspected of sorcery have to undergo the same ordeal; if found guilty, thesame punishment is awarded, and after being shaved, their hair is attached to a tree in somepublic place.” So among the Bhils of India, when a woman was convicted of witchcraft andhad been subjected to various forms of persuasion, such as hanging head downwards from atree and having pepper put into her eyes, a lock of hair was cut from her head and buried inthe ground, “that the last link between her and her former powers of mischief might be bro-ken.” In like manner among the Aztecs of Mexico, when wizards and witches “had done theirevil deeds, and the time came to put an end to their detestable life, some one laid hold ofthem and cropped the hair on the crown of their heads, which took from them all their powerof sorcery and enchantment, and then it was that by death they put an end to their odiousexistence.”2. THE EXTERNAL SOULS IN PLANTSFurther it has been shown that in folk-tales the life of a person is sometimes so bound up withthe life of a plant that the withering of the plant will immediately follow or be followed by thedeath of the person. Among the M’Bengas in Western Africa, about the Gaboon, when twochildren are born on the same day, the people plant two trees of the same kind and danceround them. The life of each of the children is believed to be bound up with the life of one ofthe trees; and if the tree dies or is thrown down, they are sure that the child will soon die. Inthe Cameroons, also, the life of a person is believed to be sympathetically bound up with thatof a tree. The chief of Old Town in Calabar kept his soul in a sacred grove near a spring ofwater. When some Europeans, in frolic or ignorance, cut down part of the grove, the spiritwas most indignant and threatened the perpetrators of the deed, according to the king, withall manner of evil.Some of the Papuans unite the life of a new-born babe sympathetically with that of a tree bydriving a pebble into the bark of the tree. This is supposed to give them complete masteryover the child’s life; if the tree is cut down, the child will die. After a birth the Maoris used tobury the navel-string in a sacred place and plant a young sapling over it. As the tree grew, itwas a tohu oranga or sign of life for the child; if it flourished, the child would prosper; if it with-ered and died, the parents augured the worst for the little one. In some parts of Fiji the navel-string of a male infant is planted together with a coco-nut or the slip of a breadfruit-tree, andthe child’s life is supposed to be intimately connected with that of the tree. Amongst theDyaks of Landak and Tajan, districts of Dutch Borneo, it is customary to plant a fruit-tree for ababy, and henceforth in the popular belief the fate of the child is bound up with that of thetree. If the tree shoots up rapidly, it will go well with the child; but if the tree is dwarfed orshrivelled, nothing but misfortune can be expected for its human counterpart.It is said that there are still families in Russia, Germany, England, France, and Italy who areaccustomed to plant a tree at the birth of a child. The tree, it is hoped, will grow with the child,and it is tended with special care. The custom is still pretty general in the canton of Aargau inSwitzerland; an apple-tree is planted for a boy and a pear-tree for a girl, and the people thinkPage 523"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"that the child will flourish or dwindle with the tree. In Mecklenburg the afterbirth is thrown outat the foot of a young tree, and the child is then believed to grow with the tree. Near theCastle of Dalhousie, not far from Edinburgh, there grows an oak-tree, called the EdgewellTree, which is popularly believed to be linked to the fate of the family by a mysterious tie; forthey say that when one of the family dies, or is about to die, a branch falls from the EdgewellTree. Thus, on seeing a great bough drop from the tree on a quiet, still day in July 1874, anold forester exclaimed, “The laird’s deid noo!” and soon after news came that Fox Maule,eleventh Earl of Dalhousie, was dead.In England children are sometimes passed through a cleft ash-tree as a cure for rupture orrickets, and thenceforward a sympathetic connexion is supposed to exist between them andthe tree. An ash-tree which had been used for this purpose grew at the edge of Shirley Heath,on the road from Hockly House to Birmingham. “Thomas Chillingworth, son of the owner ofan adjoining farm, now about thirty-four, was, when an infant of a year old, passed through asimilar tree, now perfectly sound, which he preserves with so much care that he will not suffera single branch to be touched, for it is believed the life of the patient depends on the life ofthe tree, and the moment that is cut down, be the patient ever so distant, the rupture returns,and a mortification ensues, and terminates in death, as was the case in a man driving a wag-gon on the very road in question.” “It is not uncommon, however,” adds the writer, “for per-sons to survive for a time the felling of the tree.” The ordinary mode of effecting the cure is tosplit a young ash-sapling longitudinally for a few feet and pass the child, naked, either threetimes or three times three through the fissure at sunrise. In the West of England it is said thatthe passage should be “against the sun.” As soon as the ceremony has been performed, thetree is bound tightly up and the fissure plastered over with mud or clay. The belief is that justas the cleft in the tree closes up, so the rupture in the child’s body will be healed; but that ifthe rift in the tree remains open, the rupture in the child will remain too, and if the tree were todie, the death of the child would surely follow.Asimilar cure for various diseases, but especially for rupture and rickets, has been commonlypractised in other parts of Europe, as Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden; but in thesecountries the tree employed for the purpose is usually not an ash but an oak; sometimes awillow-tree is allowed or even prescribed instead. In Mecklenburg, as in England, the sympa-thetic relation thus established between the tree and the child is believed to be so close that ifthe tree is cut down the child will die.3. THE EXTERNAL SOUL IN ANIMALSBut in practice, as in folk-tales, it is not merely with inanimate objects and plants that a per-son is occasionally believed to be united by a bond of physical sympathy. The same bond, itis supposed, may exist between a man and an animal, so that the welfare of the one dependson the welfare of the other, and when the animal dies the man dies also. The analogybetween the custom and the tales is all the closer because in both of them the power of thusremoving the soul from the body and stowing it away in an animal is often a special privilegeof wizards and witches. Thus the Yakuts of Siberia believe that every shaman or wizardkeeps his soul, or one of his souls, incarnate in an animal which is carefully concealed fromall the world. “Nobody can find my external soul,” said one famous wizard, “it lies hidden faraway in the stony mountains of Edzhigansk.” Only once a year, when the last snows melt andthe earth turns black, do these external souls of wizards appear in the shape of animalsamong the dwellings of men. They wander everywhere, yet none but wizards can see them.The strong ones sweep roaring and noisily along, the weak steal about quietly and furtively.Page 524"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"Often they fight, and then the wizard whose external soul is beaten, falls ill or dies. The weak-est and most cowardly wizards are they whose souls are incarnate in the shape of dogs, forthe dog gives his human double no peace, but gnaws his heart and tears his body. The mostpowerful wizards are they whose external souls have the shape of stallions, elks, black bears,eagles, or boars. Again, the Samoyeds of the Turukhinsk region hold that every shaman hasa familiar spirit in the shape of a boar, which he leads about by a magic belt. On the death ofthe boar the shaman himself dies; and stories are told of battles between wizards, who sendtheir spirits to fight before they encounter each other in person. The Malays believe that “thesoul of a person may pass into another person or into an animal, or rather that such a myste-rious relation can arise between the two that the fate of the one is wholly dependent on thatof the other.”Among the Melanesians of Mota, one of the New Hebrides islands, the conception of anexternal soul is carried out in the practice of daily life. In the Mota language the word tamaniusignifies “something animate or inanimate which a man has come to believe to have an exis-tence intimately connected with his own.... It was not every one in Mota who had his tamaniu;only some men fancied that they had this relation to a lizard, a snake, or it might be a stone;sometimes the thing was sought for and found by drinking the infusion of certain leaves andheaping together the dregs; then whatever living thing was first seen in or upon the heap wasthe tamaniu. It was watched but not fed or worshipped; the natives believed that it came atcall, and that the life of the man was bound up with the life of his tamaniu, if a living thing, orwith its safety; should it die, or if not living get broken or be lost, the man would die. Hence incase of sickness they would send to see if the tamaniu was safe and well.”The theory of an external soul deposited in an animal appears to be very prevalent in WestAfrica, particularly in Nigeria, the Cameroons, and the Gaboon. Among the Fans of theGaboon every wizard is believed at initiation to unite his life with that of some particular wildanimal by a rite of blood-brotherhood; he draws blood from the ear of the animal and from hisown arm, and inoculates the animal with his own blood, and himself with the blood of thebeast. Henceforth such an intimate union is established between the two that the death of theone entails the death of the other. The alliance is thought to bring to the wizard or sorcerer agreat accession of power, which he can turn to his advantage in various ways. In the firstplace, like the warlock in the fairy tales who has deposited his life outside of himself in somesafe place, the Fan wizard now deems himself invulnerable. Moreover, the animal with whichhe has exchanged blood has become his familiar, and will obey any orders he may choose togive it; so he makes use of it to injure and kill his enemies. For that reason the creature withwhom he establishes the relation of blood-brotherhood is never a tame or domestic animal,but always a ferocious and dangerous wild beast, such as a leopard, a black serpent, a croc-odile, a hippopotamus, a wild boar, or a vulture. Of all these creatures the leopard is by farthe commonest familiar of Fan wizards, and next to it comes the black serpent; the vulture isthe rarest. Witches as well as wizards have their familiars; but the animals with which thelives of women are thus bound up generally differ from those to which men commit theirexternal souls. A witch never has a panther for her familiar, but often a venomous species ofserpent, sometimes a horned viper, sometimes a black serpent, sometimes a green one thatlives in banana-trees; or it may be a vulture, an owl, or other bird of night. In every case thebeast or bird with which the witch or wizard has contracted this mystic alliance is an individ-ual, never a species; and when the individual animal dies the alliance is naturally at an end,since the death of the animal is supposed to entail the death of the man.Similar beliefs are held by the natives of the Cross River valley within the provinces of thePage 525"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"Cameroons. Groups of people, generally the inhabitants of a village, have chosen variousanimals, with which they believe themselves to stand on a footing of intimate friendship orrelationship. Amongst such animals are hippopotamuses, elephants, leopards, crocodiles,gorillas, fish, and serpents, all of them creatures which are either very strong or can easilyhide themselves in the water or a thicket. This power of concealing themselves is said to bean indispensable condition of the choice of animal familiars, since the animal friend or helperis expected to injure his owner’s enemy by stealth; for example, if he is a hippopotamus, hewill bob up suddenly out of the water and capsize the enemy’s canoe. Between the animalsand their human friends or kinsfolk such a sympathetic relation is supposed to exist that themoment the animal dies the man dies also, and similarly the instant the man perishes sodoes the beast. From this it follows that the animal kinsfolk may never be shot at or molestedfor fear of injuring or killing the persons whose lives are knit up with the lives of the brutes.This does not, however, prevent the people of a village, who have elephants for their animalfriends, from hunting elephants. For they do not respect the whole species but merely certainindividuals of it, which stand in an intimate relation to certain individual men and women; andthey imagine that they can always distinguish these brother elephants from the common herdof elephants which are mere elephants and nothing more. The recognition indeed is said tobe mutual. When a hunter, who has an elephant for his friend, meets a human elephant, aswe may call it, the noble animal lifts up a paw and holds it before his face, as much as to say,“Don’t shoot.” Were the hunter so inhuman as to fire on and wound such an elephant, theperson whose life was bound up with the elephant would fall ill.The Balong of the Cameroons think that every man has several souls, of which one is in hisbody and another in an animal, such as an elephant, a wild pig, a leopard, and so forth.When a man comes home, feeling ill, and says, “I shall soon die,” and dies accordingly, thepeople aver that one of his souls has been killed in a wild pig or a leopard and that the deathof the external soul has caused the death of the soul in his body. A similar belief in the exter-nal souls of living people is entertained by the Ibos, an important tribe of the Niger delta. Theythink that a man’s spirit can quit his body for a time during life and take up its abode in ananimal. A man who wishes to acquire this power procures a certain drug from a wise man andmixes it with his food. After that his soul goes out and enters into an animal. If it should hap-pen that the animal is killed while the man’s soul is lodged in it, the man dies; and if the ani-mal be wounded, the man’s body will presently be covered with boils. This belief instigates tomany deeds of darkness; for a sly rogue will sometimes surreptitiously administer the magicaldrug to his enemy in his food, and having thus smuggled the other’s soul into an animal willdestroy the creature, and with it the man whose soul is lodged in it.The negroes of Calabar, at the mouth of the Niger, believe that every person has four souls,one of which always lives outside of his or her body in the form of a wild beast in the forest.This external soul, or bush soul, as Miss Kingsley calls it, may be almost any animal, forexample, a leopard, a fish, or a tortoise; but it is never a domestic animal and never a plant.Unless he is gifted with second sight, a man cannot see his own bush soul, but a diviner willoften tell him what sort of creature his bush soul is, and after that the man will be careful notto kill any animal of that species, and will strongly object to any one else doing so. A man andhis sons have usually the same sort of animals for their bush souls, and so with a mother andher daughters. But sometimes all the children of a family take after the bush soul of theirfather; for example, if his external soul is a leopard, all his sons and daughters will have leop-ards for their external souls. And on the other hand, sometimes they all take after their moth-er; for instance, if her external soul is a tortoise, all the external souls of her sons and daugh-ters will be tortoises too. So intimately bound up is the life of the man with that of the animalPage 526"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"which he regards as his external or bush soul, that the death or injury of the animal necessar-ily entails the death or injury of the man. And, conversely, when the man dies, his bush soulcan no longer find a place of rest, but goes mad and rushes into the fire or charges peopleand is knocked on the head, and that is an end of it.Near Eket in North Calabar there is a sacred lake, the fish of which are carefully preservedbecause the people believe that their own souls are lodged in the fish, and that with everyfish killed a human life would be simultaneously extinguished. In the Calabar River not verymany years ago there used to be a huge old crocodile, popularly supposed to contain theexternal soul of a chief who resided in the flesh at Duke Town. Sporting vice-consuls usedfrom time to time to hunt the animal, and once an officer contrived to hit it. Forthwith the chiefwas laid up with a wound in his leg. He gave out that a dog had bitten him, but no doubt thewise shook their heads and refused to be put off with so flimsy a pretext. Again, among sev-eral tribes on the banks of the Niger between Lokoja and the delta there prevails “a belief inthe possibility of a man possessing an alter ego in the form of some animal such as a croco-dile or a hippopotamus. It is believed that such a person’s life is bound up with that of the ani-mal to such an extent that, whatever affects the one produces a corresponding impressionupon the other, and that if one dies the other must speedily do so too. It happened not verylong ago that an Englishman shot a hippopotamus close to a native village; the friends of awoman who died the same night in the village demanded and eventually obtained five poundsas compensation for the murder of the woman.”Amongst the Zapotecs of Central America, when a woman was about to be confined, herrelations assembled in the hut, and began to draw on the floor figures of different animals,rubbing each one out as soon as it was completed. This went on till the moment of birth, andthe figure that then remained sketched upon the ground was called the child’s tona or secondself. “When the child grew old enough, he procured the animal that represented him and tookcare of it, as it was believed that health and existence were bound up with that of the ani-mal’s, in fact that the death of both would occur simultaneously,” or rather that when the ani-mal died the man would die too. Among the Indians of Guatemala and Honduras the nagualor naual is “that animate or inanimate object, generally an animal, which stands in a parallelrelation to a particular man, so that the weal and woe of the man depend on the fate of thenagual.” According to an old writer, many Indians of Guatemala “are deluded by the devil tobelieve that their life dependeth upon the life of such and such a beast (which they take untothem as their familiar spirit), and think that when that beast dieth they must die; when he ischased, their hearts pant; when he is faint, they are faint; nay, it happeneth that by the devil’sdelusion they appear in the shape of that beast (which commonly by their choice is a buck, ordoe, a lion, or tigre, or dog, or eagle) and in that shape have been shot at and wounded.” TheIndians were persuaded that the death of their nagual would entail their own. Legend affirmsthat in the first battles with the Spaniards on the plateau of Quetzaltenango the naguals of theIndian chiefs fought in the form of serpents. The nagual of the highest chief was especiallyconspicuous, because it had the form of a great bird, resplendent in green plumage. TheSpanish general Pedro de Alvarado killed the bird with his lance, and at the same momentthe Indian chief fell dead to the ground.In many tribes of South-Eastern Australia each sex used to regard a particular species of ani-mals in the same way that a Central American Indian regarded his nagual, but with this differ-ence, that whereas the Indian apparently knew the individual animal with which his life wasbound up, the Australians only knew that each of their lives was bound up with some one ani-mal of the species, but they could not say with which. The result naturally was that every manPage 527"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"spared and protected all the animals of the species with which the lives of the men werebound up; and every woman spared and protected all the animals of the species with whichthe lives of the women were bound up; because no one knew but that the death of any ani-mal of the respective species might entail his or her own; just as the killing of the green birdwas immediately followed by the death of the Indian chief, and the killing of the parrot by thedeath of Punchkin in the fairy tale. Thus, for example, the Wotjobaluk tribe of South-EasternAustralia “held that ‘the life of Ngunungunut (the Bat) is the life of a man, and the life ofYártatgurk (the Nightjar) is the life of a woman,’ and that when either of these creatures iskilled the life of some man or of some woman is shortened. In such a case every man orevery woman in the camp feared that he or she might be the victim, and from this causegreat fights arose in this tribe. I learn that in these fights, men on one side and women on theother, it was not at all certain which would be victorious, for at times the women gave the mena severe drubbing with their yamsticks, while often women were injured or killed by spears.”The Wotjobaluk said that the bat was the man’s “brother” and that the nightjar was his “wife.”The particular species of animals with which the lives of the sexes were believed to berespectively bound up varied somewhat from tribe to tribe. Thus whereas among theWotjobaluk the bat was the animal of the men, at Gunbower Creek on the Lower Murray thebat seems to have been the animal of the women, for the natives would not kill it for the rea-son that “if it was killed, one of their lubras [women] would be sure to die in consequence.”But whatever the particular sorts of creature with which the lives of men and women werebelieved to be bound up, the belief itself and the fights to which it gave rise are known tohave prevailed over a large part of South-Eastern Australia, and probably they extendedmuch farther. The belief was a very serious one, and so consequently were the fights whichsprang from it. Thus among some tribes of Victoria “the common bat belongs to the men, whoprotect it against injury, even to the half-killing of their wives for its sake. The fern owl, orlarge goatsucker, belongs to the women, and, although a bird of evil omen, creating terror atnight by its cry, it is jealously protected by them. If a man kills one, they are as much enragedas if it was one of their children, and will strike him with their long poles.”The jealous protection thus afforded by Australian men and women to bats and owls respec-tively (for bats and owls seem to be the creatures usually allotted to the two sexes) is notbased upon purely selfish considerations. For each man believes that not only his own life butthe lives of his father, brothers, sons, and so on are bound up with the lives of particular bats,and that therefore in protecting the bat species he is protecting the lives of all his male rela-tions as well as his own. Similarly, each woman believes that the lives of her mother, sisters,daughters, and so forth, equally with her own, are bound up with the lives of particular owls,and that in guarding the owl species she is guarding the lives of all her female relationsbesides her own. Now, when men’s lives are thus supposed to be contained in certain ani-mals, it is obvious that the animals can hardly be distinguished from the men, or the menfrom the animals. If my brother John’s life is in a bat, then, on the one hand, the bat is mybrother as well as John; and, on the other hand, John is in a sense a bat, since his life is in abat. Similarly, if my sister Mary’s life is in an owl, then the owl is my sister and Mary is an owl.This is a natural enough conclusion, and the Australians have not failed to draw it. When thebat is the man’s animal, it is called his brother; and when the owl is the woman’s animal, it iscalled her sister. And conversely a man addresses a woman as an owl, and she addresseshim as a bat. So with the other animals allotted to the sexes respectively in other tribes. Forexample, among the Kurnai all emu-wrens were “brothers” of the men, and all the men wereemu-wrens; all superb warblers were “sisters” of the women, and all the women were superbwarblers.Page 528"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"But when a savage names himself after an animal, calls it his brother, and refuses to kill it,the animal is said to be his totem. Accordingly in the tribes of South-Eastern Australia whichwe have been considering the bat and the owl, the emu-wren and the superb warbler, mayproperly be described as totems of the sexes. But the assignation of a totem to a sex is com-paratively rare, and has hitherto been discovered nowhere but in Australia. Far more com-monly the totem is appropriated not to a sex, but to a clan, and is hereditary either in themale or female line. The relation of an individual to the clan totem does not differ in kind fromhis relation to the sex totem; he will not kill it, he speaks of it as his brother, and he calls him-self by its name. Now if the relations are similar, the explanation which holds good of the oneought equally to hold good of the other. Therefore, the reason why a clan revere a particularspecies of animals or plants (for the clan totem may be a plant) and call themselves after it,would seem to be a belief that the life of each individual of the clan is bound up with someone animal or plant of the species, and that his or her death would be the consequence ofkilling that particular animal, or destroying that particular plant. This explanation of totemismsquares very well with Sir George Grey’s definition of a totem or kobong in Western Australia.He says: “A certain mysterious connexion exists between a family and its kobong, so that amember of the family will never kill an animal of the species to which his kobong belongs,should he find it asleep; indeed he always kills it reluctantly, and never without affording it achance to escape. This arises from the family belief that some one individual of the species istheir nearest friend, to kill whom would be a great crime, and to be carefully avoided.Similarly, a native who has a vegetable for his kobong may not gather it under certain circum-stances, and at a particular period of the year.” Here it will be observed that though each manspares all the animals or plants of the species, they are not all equally precious to him; farfrom it, out of the whole species there is only one which is specially dear to him; but as hedoes not know which the dear one is, he is obliged to spare them all from fear of injuring theone. Again, this explanation of the clan totem harmonises with the supposed effect of killingone of the totem species. “One day one of the blacks killed a crow. Three or four days after-wards a Boortwa (crow) [i.e. a man of the Crow clan] named Larry died. He had been ailingfor some days, but the killing of his wingong [totem] hastened his death.” Here the killing ofthe crow caused the death of a man of the Crow clan, exactly as, in the case of the sex-totems, the killing of a bat causes the death of a Bat-man or the killing of an owl causes thedeath of an Owl-woman. Similarly, the killing of his nagual causes the death of a CentralAmerican Indian, the killing of his bush soul causes the death of a Calabar negro, the killingof his tamaniu causes the death of a Banks Islander, and the killing of the animal in which hislife is stowed away causes the death of the giant or warlock in the fairy tale.Thus it appears that the story of “The giant who had no heart in his body” may perhaps fur-nish the key to the relation which is supposed to subsist between a man and his totem. Thetotem, on this theory, is simply the receptacle in which a man keeps his life, as Punchkin kepthis life in a parrot, and Bidasari kept her soul in a golden fish. It is no valid objection to thisview that when a savage has both a sex totem and a clan totem his life must be bound upwith two different animals, the death of either of which would entail his own. If a man hasmore vital places than one in his body, why, the savage may think, should he not have morevital places than one outside it? Why, since he can put his life outside himself, should he nottransfer one portion of it to one animal and another to another? The divisibility of life, or, toput it otherwise, the plurality of souls, is an idea suggested by many familiar facts, and hascommended itself to philosophers like Plato, as well as to savages. It is only when the notionof a soul, from being a quasi-scientific hypothesis, becomes a theological dogma that its unityand indivisibility are insisted upon as essential. The savage, unshackled by dogma, is free toexplain the facts of life by the assumption of as many souls as he thinks necessary. Hence,Page 529"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"for example, the Caribs supposed that there was one soul in the head, another in the heart,and other souls at all the places where an artery is felt pulsating. Some of the Hidatsa Indiansexplain the phenomena of gradual death, when the extremities appear dead first, by suppos-ing that man has four souls, and that they quit the body, not simultaneously, but one after theother, dissolution being only complete when all four have departed. Some of the Dyaks ofBorneo and the Malays of the Peninsula believe that every man has seven souls. The Alfoorsof Poso in Celebes are of opinion that he has three. The natives of Laos suppose that thebody is the seat of thirty spirits, which reside in the hands, the feet, the mouth, the eyes, andso on. Hence, from the primitive point of view, it is perfectly possible that a savage shouldhave one soul in his sex totem and another in his clan totem. However, as I have observed,sex totems have been found nowhere but in Australia; so that as a rule the savage who prac-tises totemism need not have more than one soul out of his body at a time.If this explanation of the totem as a receptacle in which a man keeps his soul or one of hissouls is correct, we should expect to find some totemic people of whom it is expressly saidthat every man amongst them is believed to keep at least one soul permanently out of hisbody, and that the destruction of this external soul is supposed to entail the death of itsowner. Such a people are the Bataks of Sumatra. The Bataks are divided into exogamousclans (margas) with descent in the male line; and each clan is forbidden to eat the flesh of aparticular animal. One clan may not eat the tiger, another the ape, another the crocodile,another the dog, another the cat, another the dove, another the white buffalo, and another thelocust. The reason given by members of a clan for abstaining from the flesh of the particularanimal is either that they are descended from animals of that species, and that their soulsafter death may transmigrate into the animals, or that they or their forefathers have beenunder certain obligations to the creatures. Sometimes, but not always, the clan bears thename of the animal. Thus the Bataks have totemism in full. But, further, each Batak believesthat he has seven or, on a more moderate computation, three souls. One of these souls isalways outside the body, but nevertheless whenever it dies, however far away it may be atthe time, that same moment the man dies also. The writer who mentions this belief says noth-ing about the Batak totems; but on the analogy of the Australian, Central American, andAfrican evidence we may conjecture that the external soul, whose death entails the death ofthe man, is housed in the totemic animal or plant.Against this view it can hardly be thought to militate that the Batak does not in set termsaffirm his external soul to be in his totem, but alleges other grounds for respecting the sacredanimal or plant of his clan. For if a savage seriously believes that his life is bound up with anexternal object, it is in the last degree unlikely that he will let any stranger into the secret. Inall that touches his inmost life and beliefs the savage is exceedingly suspicious and reserved;Europeans have resided among savages for years without discovering some of their capitalarticles of faith, and in the end the discovery has often been the result of accident. Above all,the savage lives in an intense and perpetual dread of assassination by sorcery; the most tri-fling relics of his person—the clippings of his hair and nails, his spittle, the remnants of hisfood, his very name—all these may, he fancies, be turned by the sorcerer to his destruction,and he is therefore anxiously careful to conceal or destroy them. But if in matters such asthese, which are but the outposts and outworks of his life, he is so shy and secretive, howclose must be the concealment, how impenetrable the reserve in which he enshrouds theinner keep and citadel of his being! When the princess in the fairy tale asks the giant wherehe keeps his soul, he often gives false or evasive answers, and it is only after much coaxingand wheedling that the secret is at last wrung from him. In his jealous reticence the giantresembles the timid and furtive savage; but whereas the exigencies of the story demand thatPage 530"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"the giant should at last reveal his secret, no such obligation is laid on the savage; and noinducement that can be offered is likely to tempt him to imperil his soul by revealing its hiding-place to a stranger. It is therefore no matter for surprise that the central mystery of the sav-age’s life should so long have remained a secret, and that we should be left to piece it togeth-er from scattered hints and fragments and from the recollections of it which linger in fairytales.4. THE RITUAL OF DEATH AND RESURRECTIONThis view of totemism throws light on a class of religious rites of which no adequate explana-tion, so far as I am aware, has yet been offered. Amongst many savage tribes, especiallysuch as are known to practice totemism, it is customary for lads at puberty to undergo certaininitiatory rites, of which one of the commonest is a pretence of killing the lad and bringing himto life again. Such rites become intelligible if we suppose that their substance consists inextracting the youth’s soul in order to transfer it to his totem. For the extraction of his soulwould naturally be supposed to kill the youth or at least to throw him into a death-like trance,which the savage hardly distinguishes from death. His recovery would then be attributedeither to the gradual recovery of his system from the violent shock which it had received, or,more probably, to the infusion into him of fresh life drawn from the totem. Thus the essence ofthese initiatory rites, so far as they consist in a simulation of death and resurrection, would bean exchange of life or souls between the man and his totem. The primitive belief in the possi-bility of such an exchange of souls comes clearly out in a story of a Basque hunter whoaffirmed that he had been killed by a bear, but that the bear had, after killing him, breathed itsown soul into him, so that the bear’s body was now dead, but he himself was a bear, beinganimated by the bear’s soul. This revival of the dead hunter as a bear is exactly analogous towhat, on the theory here suggested, is supposed to take place in the ceremony of killing a ladat puberty and bringing him to life again. The lad dies as a man and comes to life again as ananimal; the animal’s soul is now in him, and his human soul is in the animal. With good right,therefore, does he call himself a Bear or a Wolf, etc., according to his totem; and with goodright does he treat the bears or the wolves, etc., as his brethren, since in these animals arelodged the souls of himself and his kindred.Examples of this supposed death and resurrection at initiation are as follows. In the Wonghior Wonghibon tribe of New South Wales the youths on approaching manhood are initiated ata secret ceremony, which none but initiated men may witness. Part of the proceedings con-sists in knocking out a tooth and giving a new name to the novice, indicative of the changefrom youth to manhood. While the teeth are being knocked out an instrument known as abull-roarer, which consists of a flat piece of wood with serrated edges tied to the end of astring, is swung round so as to produce a loud humming noise. The uninitiated are notallowed to see this instrument. Women are forbidden to witness the ceremonies under pain ofdeath. It is given out that the youths are each met in turn by a mythical being, calledThuremlin (more commonly known as Daramulun) who takes the youth to a distance, killshim, and in some instances cuts him up, after which he restores him to life and knocks out atooth. Their belief in the power of Thuremlin is said to be undoubted.The Ualaroi of the Upper Darling River said that at initiation the boy met a ghost, who killedhim and brought him to life again as a young man. Among the natives on the Lower Lachlanand Murray Rivers it was Thrumalun (Daramulun) who was thought to slay and resuscitatethe novices. In the Unmatjera tribe of Central Australia women and children believe that aspirit called Twanyirika kills the youth and afterwards brings him to life again during the periodPage 531"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"of initiation. The rites of initiation in this tribe, as in the other Central tribes, comprise theoperations of circumcision and subincision; and as soon as the second of these has beenperformed on him, the young man receives from his father a sacred stick (churinga), withwhich, he is told, his spirit was associated in the remotest past. While he is out in the bushrecovering from his wounds, he must swing the bull-roarer, or a being who lives up in the skywill swoop down and carry him off. In the Binbinga tribe, on the western coast of the Gulf ofCarpentaria, the women and children believe that the noise of the bull-roarer at initiation ismade by a spirit named Katajalina, who lives in an ant-hill and comes out and eats up theboy, afterwards restoring him to life. Similarly among their neighbours the Anula the womenimagine that the droning sound of the bull-roarer is produced by a spirit called Gnabaia, whoswallows the lads at initiation and afterwards disgorges them in the form of initiated men.Among the tribes settled on the southern coast of New South Wales, of which the CoastMurring tribe may be regarded as typical, the drama of resurrection from the dead was exhib-ited in a graphic form to the novices at initiation. The ceremony has been described for us byan eye-witness. A man, disguised with stringy bark fibre, lay down in a grave and was lightlycovered up with sticks and earth. In his hand he held a small bush, which appeared to begrowing in the soil, and other bushes were stuck in the ground to heighten the effect. Thenthe novices were brought and placed beside the grave. Next, a procession of men, disguisedin stringy bark fibre, drew near. They represented a party of medicine-men, guided by tworeverend seniors, who had come on pilgrimage to the grave of a brother medicine-man, wholay buried there. When the little procession, chanting an invocation to Daramulun, had defiledfrom among the rocks and trees into the open, it drew up on the side of the grave opposite tothe novices, the two old men taking up a position in the rear of the dancers. For some timethe dance and song went on till the tree that seemed to grow from the grave began to quiver.“Look there!” cried the men to the novices, pointing to the trembling leaves. As they looked,the tree quivered more and more, then was violently agitated and fell to the ground, whileamid the excited dancing of the dancers and the chanting of the choir the supposed deadman spurned from him the superincumbent mass of sticks and leaves, and springing to hisfeet danced his magic dance in the grave itself, and exhibited in his mouth the magic sub-stances which he was supposed to have received from Daramulun in person.Some tribes of Northern New Guinea—the Yabim, Bukaua, Kai, and Tami—like manyAustralian tribes, require every male member of the tribe to be circumcised before he ranksas a full-grown man; and the tribal initiation, of which circumcision is the central feature, isconceived by them, as by some Australian tribes, as a process of being swallowed and dis-gorged by a mythical monster, whose voice is heard in the humming sound of the bull-roarer.Indeed the New Guinea tribes not only impress this belief on the minds of women and chil-dren, but enact it in a dramatic form at the actual rites of initiation, at which no woman oruninitiated person may be present. For this purpose a hut about a hundred feet long is erect-ed either in the village or in a lonely part of the forest. It is modelled in the shape of the mythi-cal monster; at the end which represents his head it is high, and it tapers away at the otherend. A betel-palm, grubbed up with the roots, stands for the backbone of the great being andits clustering fibres for his hair; and to complete the resemblance the butt end of the buildingis adorned by a native artist with a pair of goggle eyes and a gaping mouth. When after atearful parting from their mothers and women folk, who believe or pretend to believe in themonster that swallows their dear ones, the awe-struck novices are brought face to face withthis imposing structure, the huge creature emits a sullen growl, which is in fact no other thanthe humming note of bull-roarers swung by men concealed in the monster’s belly. The actualprocess of deglutition is variously enacted. Among the Tami it is represented by causing thePage 532"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"candidates to defile past a row of men who hold bull-roarers over their heads; among the Kaiit is more graphically set forth by making them pass under a scaffold on which stands a man,who makes a gesture of swallowing and takes in fact a gulp of water as each tremblingnovice passes beneath him. But the present of a pig, opportunely offered for the redemptionof the youth, induces the monster to relent and disgorge his victim; the man who representsthe monster accepts the gift vicariously, a gurgling sound is heard, and the water which hadjust been swallowed descends in a jet on the novice. This signifies that the young man hasbeen released from the monster’s belly. However, he has now to undergo the more painfuland dangerous operation of circumcision. It follows immediately, and the cut made by theknife of the operator is explained to be a bite or scratch which the monster inflicted on thenovice in spewing him out of his capacious maw. While the operation is proceeding, a prodi-gious noise is made by the swinging of bull-roarers to represent the roar of the dreadful beingwho is in the act of swallowing the young man.When, as sometimes happens, a lad dies from the effect of the operation, he is buried secret-ly in the forest, and his sorrowing mother is told that the monster has a pig’s stomach as wellas a human stomach, and that unfortunately her son slipped into the wrong stomach, fromwhich it was impossible to extricate him. After they have been circumcised the lads mustremain for some months in seclusion, shunning all contact with women and even the sight ofthem. They live in the long hut which represents the monster’s belly. When at last the lads,now ranking as initiated men, are brought back with great pomp and ceremony to the village,they are received with sobs and tears of joy by the women, as if the grave had given up itsdead. At first the young men keep their eyes rigidly closed or even sealed with a plaster ofchalk, and they appear not to understand the words of command which are given them by anelder. Gradually, however, they come to themselves as if awakening from a stupor, and nextday they bathe and wash off the crust of white chalk with which their bodies had been coated.It is highly significant that all these tribes of New Guinea apply the same word to the bull-roar-er and to the monster, who is supposed to swallow the novices at circumcision, and whosefearful roar is represented by the hum of the harmless wooden instruments. Further, itdeserves to be noted that in three languages out of the four the same word which is appliedto the bull-roarer and to the monster means also a ghost or spirit of the dead, while in thefourth language (the Kai) it signifies “grandfather.” From this it seems to follow that the beingwho swallows and disgorges the novices at initiation is believed to be a powerful ghost orancestral spirit, and that the bull-roarer, which bears his name, is his material representative.That would explain the jealous secrecy with which the sacred implement is kept from the sightof women. While they are not in use, the bull-roarers are stowed away in the men’s club-houses, which no woman may enter; indeed no woman or uninitiated person may set eyes ona bull-roarer under pain of death. Similarly among the Tugeri or Kaya-Kaya, a large Papuantribe on the south coast of Dutch New Guinea, the name of the bull-roarer, which they callsosom, is given to a mythical giant, who is supposed to appear every year with the south-eastmonsoon. When he comes, a festival is held in his honour and bull-roarers are swung. Boysare presented to the giant, and he kills them, but considerately brings them to life again.In certain districts of Viti Levu, the largest of the Fijian Islands, the drama of death and resur-rection used to be acted with much solemnity before the eyes of young men at initiation. In asacred enclosure they were shown a row of dead or seemingly dead men lying on theground, their bodies cut open and covered with blood, their entrails protruding. But at a yellfrom the high priest the counterfeit dead men started to their feet and ran down to the river tocleanse themselves from the blood and guts of pigs with which they were beslobbered. SoonPage 533"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"they marched back to the sacred enclosure as if come to life, clean, fresh, and garlanded,swaying their bodies in time to the music of a solemn hymn, and took their places in front ofthe novices. Such was the drama of death and resurrection.The people of Rook, an island between New Guinea and New Britain, hold festivals at whichone or two disguised men, their heads covered with wooden masks, go dancing through thevillage, followed by all the other men. They demand that the circumcised boys who have notyet been swallowed by Marsaba (the devil) shall be given up to them. The boys, tremblingand shrieking, are delivered to them, and must creep between the legs of the disguised men.Then the procession moves through the village again, and announces that Marsaba haseaten up the boys, and will not disgorge them till he receives a present of pigs, taro, and soforth. So all the villagers, according to their means, contribute provisions, which are then con-sumed in the name of Marsaba.In the west of Ceram boys at puberty are admitted to the Kakian association. Modern writershave commonly regarded this association as primarily a political league instituted to resist for-eign domination. In reality its objects are purely religious and social, though it is possible thatthe priests may have occasionally used their powerful influence for political ends. The societyis in fact merely one of those widely-diffused primitive institutions, of which a chief object isthe initiation of young men. In recent years the true nature of the association has been dulyrecognised by the distinguished Dutch ethnologist, J. G. F. Riedel. The Kakian house is anoblong wooden shed, situated under the darkest trees in the depth of the forest, and is built toadmit so little light that it is impossible to see what goes on in it. Every village has such ahouse. Thither the boys who are to be initiated are conducted blindfold, followed by their par-ents and relations. Each boy is led by the hand of two men, who act as his sponsors orguardians, looking after him during the period of initiation. When all are assembled before theshed, the high priest calls aloud upon the devils. Immediately a hideous uproar is heard toproceed from the shed. It is made by men with bamboo trumpets, who have been secretlyintroduced into the building by a back door, but the women and children think it is made bythe devils, and are much terrified. Then the priests enter the shed, followed by the boys, oneat a time. As soon as each boy has disappeared within the precincts, a dull chopping sound isheard, a fearful cry rings out, and a sword or spear, dripping with blood, is thrust through theroof of the shed. This is a token that the boy’s head has been cut off, and that the devil hascarried him away to the other world, there to regenerate and transform him. So at sight of thebloody sword the mothers weep and wail, crying that the devil has murdered their children. Insome places, it would seem, the boys are pushed through an opening made in the shape of acrocodile’s jaws or a cassowary’s beak, and it is then said that the devil has swallowed them.The boys remain in the shed for five or nine days. Sitting in the dark, they hear the blast ofthe bamboo trumpets, and from time to time the sound of musket shots and the clash ofswords. Every day they bathe, and their faces and bodies are smeared with a yellow dye, togive them the appearance of having been swallowed by the devil. During his stay in theKakian house each boy has one or two crosses tattooed with thorns on his breast or arm.When they are not sleeping, the lads must sit in a crouching posture without moving a mus-cle. As they sit in a row cross-legged, with their hands stretched out, the chief takes his trum-pet, and placing the mouth of it on the hands of each lad, speaks through it in strange tones,imitating the voice of the spirits. He warns the lads, under pain of death, to observe the rulesof the Kakian society, and never to reveal what has passed in the Kakian house. The novicesare also told by the priests to behave well to their blood relations, and are taught the tradi-tions and secrets of the tribe. Page 534"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"Meantime the mothers and sisters of the lads have gone home to weep and mourn. But in aday or two the men who acted as guardians or sponsors to the novices return to the villagewith the glad tidings that the devil, at the intercession of the priests, has restored the lads tolife. The men who bring this news come in a fainting state and daubed with mud, like mes-sengers freshly arrived from the nether world. Before leaving the Kakian house, each ladreceives from the priest a stick adorned at both ends with a cock’s or cassowary’s feathers.The sticks are supposed to have been given to the lads by the devil at the time when herestored them to life, and they serve as a token that the youths have been in the spirit land.When they return to their homes they totter in their walk, and enter the house backward, as ifthey had forgotten how to walk properly; or they enter the house by the back door. If a plateof food is given to them, they hold it upside down. They remain dumb, indicating their wantsby signs only. All this is to show that they are still under the influence of the devil or the spir-its. Their sponsors have to teach them all the common acts of life, as if they were newbornchildren. Further, upon leaving the Kakian house the boys are strictly forbidden to eat of cer-tain fruits until the next celebration of the rites has taken place. And for twenty or thirty daystheir hair may not be combed by their mothers or sisters. At the end of that time the highpriest takes them to a lonely place in the forest, and cuts off a lock of hair from the crown ofeach of their heads. After these initiatory rites the lads are deemed men, and may marry; itwould be a scandal if they married before. In the region of the Lower Congo a simulation of death and resurrection is, or rather used tobe, practised by the members of a guild or secret society called ndembo. “In the practice ofNdembo the initiating doctors get some one to fall down in a pretended fit, and in that statehe is carried away to an enclosed place outside the town. This is called ‘dying Ndembo.’Others follow suit, generally boys and girls, but often young men and women... . They aresupposed to have died. But the parents and friends supply food, and after a period varying,according to custom, from three months to three years, it is arranged that the doctor shallbring them to life again... . When the doctor’s fee has been paid, and money (goods) savedfor a feast, the Ndembo people are brought to life. At first they pretend to know no one andnothing; they do not even know how to masticate food, and friends have to perform that officefor them. They want everything nice that any one uninitiated may have, and beat them if it isnot granted, or even strangle and kill people. They do not get into trouble for this, because itis thought that they do not know better. Sometimes they carry on the pretence of talking gib-berish, and behaving as if they had returned from the spirit-world. After this they are knownby another name, peculiar to those who have ‘died Ndembo.’ ... We hear of the custom faralong on the upper river, as well as in the cataract region.”Among some of the Indian tribes of North America there exist certain religious associationswhich are only open to candidates who have gone through a pretence of being killed andbrought to life again. In 1766 or 1767 Captain Jonathan Carver witnessed the admission of acandidate to an association called “the friendly society of the Spirit” (Wakon-Kitchewah)among the Naudowessies, a Siouan or Dacotan tribe in the region of the great lakes. Thecandidate knelt before the chief, who told him that “he himself was now agitated by the samespirit which he should in a few moments communicate to him; that it would strike him dead,but that he would instantly be restored again to life; to this he added, that the communication,however terrifying, was a necessary introduction to the advantages enjoyed by the communityinto which he was on the point of being admitted. As he spoke this, he appeared to be greatlyagitated; till at last his emotions became so violent, that his countenance was distorted, andhis whole frame convulsed. At this juncture he threw something that appeared both in shapeand colour like a small bean, at the young man, which seemed to enter his mouth, and hePage 535"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"instantly fell as motionless as if he had been shot.” For a time the man lay like dead, butunder a shower of blows he showed signs of consciousness, and finally, discharging from hismouth the bean, or whatever it was that the chief had thrown at him, he came to life. In othertribes, for example, the Ojebways, Winnebagoes, and Dacotas or Sioux, the instrument bywhich the candidate is apparently slain is the medicine-bag. The bag is made of the skin ofan animal (such as the otter, wild cat, serpent, bear, raccoon, wolf, owl, weasel), of which itroughly preserves the shape. Each member of the society has one of these bags, in which hekeeps the odds and ends that make up his “medicine” or charms. “They believe that from themiscellaneous contents in the belly of the skin bag or animal there issues a spirit or breath,which has the power, not only to knock down and kill a man, but also to set him up andrestore him to life.” The mode of killing a man with one of these medicine-bags is to thrust itat him; he falls like dead, but a second thrust of the bag restores him to life.Aceremony witnessed by the castaway John R. Jewitt during his captivity among the Indiansof Nootka Sound doubtless belongs to this class of customs. The Indian king or chief “dis-charged a pistol close to his son’s ear, who immediately fell down as if killed, upon which allthe women of the house set up a most lamentable cry, tearing handfuls of hair from theirheads, and exclaiming that the prince was dead; at the same time a great number of theinhabitants rushed into the house armed with their daggers, muskets, etc., enquiring thecause of their outcry. These were immediately followed by two others dressed in wolf-skins,with masks over their faces representing the head of that animal. The latter came in on theirhands and feet in the manner of a beast, and taking up the prince, carried him off upon theirbacks, retiring in the same manner they entered.” In another place Jewitt mentions that theyoung prince—a lad of about eleven years of age—wore a mask in imitation of a wolf’s head.Now, as the Indians of this part of America are divided into totem clans, of which the Wolfclan is one of the principal, and as the members of each clan are in the habit of wearingsome portion of the totem animal about their person, it is probable that the prince belonged tothe Wolf clan, and that the ceremony described by Jewitt represented the killing of the lad inorder that he might be born anew as a wolf, much in the same way that the Basque huntersupposed himself to have been killed and to have come to life again as a bear.This conjectural explanation of the ceremony has, since it was first put forward, been to someextent confirmed by the researches of Dr. Franz Boas among these Indians; though it wouldseem that the community to which the chief’s son thus obtained admission was not so mucha totem clan as a secret society called Tlokoala, whose members imitated wolves. Every newmember of the society must be initiated by the wolves. At night a pack of wolves, personatedby Indians dressed in wolf-skins and wearing wolf-masks, make their appearance, seize thenovice, and carry him into the woods. When the wolves are heard outside the village, comingto fetch away the novice, all the members of the society blacken their faces and sing, “Amongall the tribes is great excitement, because I am Tlokoala.” Next day the wolves bring back thenovice dead, and the members of the society have to revive him. The wolves are supposed tohave put a magic stone into his body, which must be removed before he can come to life. Tillthis is done the pretended corpse is left lying outside the house. Two wizards go and removethe stone, which appears to be quartz, and then the novice is resuscitated. Among the NiskaIndians of British Columbia, who are divided into four principal clans with the raven, the wolf,the eagle, and the bear for their respective totems, the novice at initiation is always broughtback by an artificial totem animal. Thus when a man was about to be initiated into a secretsociety called Olala, his friends drew their knives and pretended to kill him. In reality they lethim slip away, while they cut off the head of a dummy which had been adroitly substituted forhim. Then they laid the decapitated dummy down and covered it over, and the women beganPage 536"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"to mourn and wail. His relations gave a funeral banquet and solemnly burnt the effigy. Inshort, they held a regular funeral. For a whole year the novice remained absent and wasseen by none but members of the secret society. But at the end of that time he came backalive, carried by an artificial animal which represented his totem.In these ceremonies the essence of the rite appears to be the killing of the novice in his char-acter of a man and his restoration to life in the form of the animal which is thenceforward tobe, if not his guardian spirit, at least linked to him in a peculiarly intimate relation. It is to beremembered that the Indians of Guatemala, whose life was bound up with an animal, weresupposed to have the power of appearing in the shape of the particular creature with whichthey were thus sympathetically united. Hence it seems not unreasonable to conjecture that inlike manner the Indians of British Columbia may imagine that their life depends on the life ofsome one of that species of creature to which they assimilate themselves by their costume. Atleast if that is not an article of belief with the Columbian Indians of the present day, it mayvery well have been so with their ancestors in the past, and thus may have helped to mouldthe rites and ceremonies both of the totem clans and of the secret societies. For though thesetwo sorts of communities differ in respect of the mode in which membership of them isobtained—a man being born into his totem clan but admitted into a secret society later inlife—we can hardly doubt that they are near akin and have their root in the same mode ofthought. That thought, if I am right, is the possibility of establishing a sympathetic relation withan animal, a spirit, or other mighty being, with whom a man deposits for safe-keeping his soulor some part of it, and from whom he receives in return a gift of magical powers.Thus, on the theory here suggested, wherever totemism is found, and wherever a pretence ismade of killing and bringing to life again the novice at initiation, there may exist or have exist-ed not only a belief in the possibility of permanently depositing the soul in some externalobject—animal, plant, or what not—but an actual intention of so doing. If the question is put,why do men desire to deposit their life outside their bodies? the answer can only be that, likethe giant in the fairy tale, they think it safer to do so than to carry it about with them, just aspeople deposit their money with a banker rather than carry it on their persons. We have seenthat at critical periods the life or soul is sometimes temporarily stowed away in a safe place tillthe danger is past. But institutions like totemism are not resorted to merely on special occa-sions of danger; they are systems into which every one, or at least every male, is obliged tobe initiated at a certain period of life. Now the period of life at which initiation takes place isregularly puberty; and this fact suggests that the special danger which totemism and systemslike it are intended to obviate is supposed not to arise till sexual maturity has been attained, infact, that the danger apprehended is believed to attend the relation of the sexes to eachother. It would be easy to prove by a long array of facts that the sexual relation is associatedin the primitive mind with many serious perils; but the exact nature of the danger apprehend-ed is still obscure. We may hope that a more exact acquaintance with savage modes ofthought will in time disclose this central mystery of primitive society, and will thereby furnishthe clue, not only to totemism, but to the origin of the marriage system.Chapter LXVIIIThe Golden BoughTHUS the view that Balder’s life was in the mistletoe is entirely in harmony with primitivemodes of thought. It may indeed sound like a contradiction that, if his life was in the mistletoe,he should nevertheless have been killed by a blow from the plant. But when a person’s life isconceived as embodied in a particular object, with the existence of which his own existence isPage 537"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"inseparably bound up, and the destruction of which involves his own, the object in questionmay be regarded and spoken of indifferently as his life or his death, as happens in the fairytales. Hence if a man’s death is in an object, it is perfectly natural that he should be killed bya blow from it. In the fairy tales Koshchei the Deathless is killed by a blow from the egg or thestone in which his life or death is secreted; the ogres burst when a certain grain of sand—doubtless containing their life or death—is carried over their heads; the magician dies whenthe stone in which his life or death is contained is put under his pillow; and the Tartar hero iswarned that he may be killed by the golden arrow or golden sword in which his soul has beenstowed away.The idea that the life of the oak was in the mistletoe was probably suggested, as I have said,by the observation that in winter the mistletoe growing on the oak remains green while theoak itself is leafless. But the position of the plant—growing not from the ground but from thetrunk or branches of the tree—might confirm this idea. Primitive man might think that, likehimself, the oak-spirit had sought to deposit his life in some safe place, and for this purposehad pitched on the mistletoe, which, being in a sense neither on earth nor in heaven, mightbe supposed to be fairly out of harm’s way. In a former chapter we saw that primitive manseeks to preserve the life of his human divinities by keeping them poised between earth andheaven, as the place where they are least likely to be assailed by the dangers that encom-pass the life of man on earth. We can therefore understand why it has been a rule both ofancient and of modern folk-medicine that the mistletoe should not be allowed to touch theground; were it to touch the ground, its healing virtue would be gone. This may be a survivalof the old superstition that the plant in which the life of the sacred tree was concentratedshould not be exposed to the risk incurred by contact with the earth. In an Indian legend,which offers a parallel to the Balder myth, Indra swore to the demon Namuci that he wouldslay him neither by day nor by night, neither with staff nor with bow, neither with the palm ofthe hand nor with the fist, neither with the wet nor with the dry. But he killed him in the morn-ing twilight by sprinkling over him the foam of the sea. The foam of the sea is just such anobject as a savage might choose to put his life in, because it occupies that sort of intermedi-ate or nondescript position between earth and sky or sea and sky in which primitive man seessafety. It is therefore not surprising that the foam of the river should be the totem of a clan inIndia.Again, the view that the mistletoe owes its mystic character partly to its not growing on theground is confirmed by a parallel superstition about the mountain-ash or rowan-tree. InJutland a rowan that is found growing out of the top of another tree is esteemed “exceedinglyeffective against witchcraft: since it does not grow on the ground witches have no power overit; if it is to have its full effect it must be cut on Ascension Day.” Hence it is placed over doorsto prevent the ingress of witches. In Sweden and Norway, also, magical properties areascribed to a “flying-rowan” (flögrönn), that is to a rowan which is found growing not in theordinary fashion on the ground but on another tree, or on a roof, or in a cleft of the rock,where it has sprouted from seed scattered by birds. They say that a man who is out in thedark should have a bit of “flying-rowan” with him to chew; else he runs a risk of beingbewitched and of being unable to stir from the spot. Just as in Scandinavia the parasiticrowan is deemed a countercharm to sorcery, so in Germany the parasitic mistletoe is stillcommonly considered a protection against witch-craft, and in Sweden, as we saw, the mistle-toe which is gathered on Midsummer Eve is attached to the ceiling of the house, the horse’sstall or the cow’s crib, in the belief that this renders the Troll powerless to injure man or beast.The view that the mistletoe was not merely the instrument of Balder’s death, but that it con-Page 538"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"tained his life, is countenanced by the analogy of a Scottish superstition. Tradition ran that thefate of the Hays of Errol, an estate in Perthshire, near the Firth of Tay, was bound up with themistletoe that grew on a certain great oak. A member of the Hay family has recorded the oldbelief as follows: “Among the low country families the badges are now almost generally for-gotten; but it appears by an ancient MS., and the tradition of a few old people in Perthshire,that the badge of the Hays was the mistletoe. There was formerly in the neighbourhood ofErrol, and not far from the Falcon stone, a vast oak of an unknown age, and upon which grewa profusion of the plant: many charms and legends were considered to be connected with thetree, and the duration of the family of Hay was said to be united with its existence. It wasbelieved that a sprig of the mistletoe cut by a Hay on Allhallowmas eve, with a new dirk, andafter surrounding the tree three times sunwise, and pronouncing a certain spell, was a surecharm against all glamour or witchery, and an infallible guard in the day of battle. A spraygathered in the same manner was placed in the cradle of infants, and thought to defend themfrom being changed for elfbairns by the fairies. Finally, it was affirmed, that when the root ofthe oak had perished, ‘the grass should grow in the hearth of Errol, and a raven should sit inthe falcon’s nest.’ The two most unlucky deeds which could be done by one of the name ofHay was, to kill a white falcon, and to cut down a limb from the oak of Errol. When the oldtree was destroyed I could never learn. The estate has been sold out of the family of Hay,and of course it is said that the fatal oak was cut down a short time before.” The old supersti-tion is recorded in verses which are traditionally ascribed to Thomas the Rhymer: While the mistletoe bats on Errol’s aik, And that aik stands fast, The Hays shall flourish, and their good grey hawk Shall nocht flinch before the blast. But when the root of the aik decays,And the mistletoe dwines on its withered breast, The grass shall grow on Errol’s hearthstane, And the corbie roup in the falcon’s nest.It is not a new opinion that the Golden Bough was the mistletoe. True, Virgil does not identifybut only compares it with mistletoe. But this may be only a poetical device to cast a mysticglamour over the humble plant. Or, more probably, his description was based on a popularsuperstition that at certain times the mistletoe blazed out into a supernatural golden glory. Thepoet tells how two doves, guiding Aeneas to the gloomy vale in whose depth grew the GoldenBough, alighted upon a tree, “whence shone a flickering gleam of gold. As in the woods inwinter cold the mistletoe—a plant not native to its tree—is green with fresh leaves and twinesits yellow berries about the boles; such seemed upon the shady holm-oak the leafy gold, sorustled in the gentle breeze the golden leaf.” Here Virgil definitely describes the GoldenBough as growing on a holm-oak, and compares it with the mistletoe. The inference is almostinevitable that the Golden Bough was nothing but the mistletoe seen through the haze ofpoetry or of popular superstition.Now grounds have been shown for believing that the priest of the Arician grove—the King ofthe Wood—personified the tree on which grew the Golden Bough. Hence if that tree was theoak, the King of the Wood must have been a personification of the oakspirit. It is, therefore,easy to understand why, before he could be slain, it was necessary to break the GoldenBough. As an oak-spirit, his life or death was in the mistletoe on the oak, and so long as themistletoe remained intact, he, like Balder, could not die. To slay him, therefore, it was neces-sary to break the mistletoe, and probably, as in the case of Balder, to throw it at him. And toPage 539"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"complete the parallel, it is only necessary to suppose that the King of the Wood was formerlyburned, dead or alive, at the midsummer fire festival which, as we have seen, was annuallycelebrated in the Arician grove. The perpetual fire which burned in the grove, like the perpetu-al fire which burned in the temple of Vesta at Rome and under the oak at Romove, was prob-ably fed with the sacred oak-wood; and thus it would be in a great fire of oak that the King ofthe Wood formerly met his end. At a later time, as I have suggested, his annual tenure ofoffice was lengthened or shortened, as the case might be, by the rule which allowed him tolive so long as he could prove his divine right by the strong hand. But he only escaped thefire to fall by the sword.Thus it seems that at a remote age in the heart of Italy, beside the sweet Lake of Nemi, thesame fiery tragedy was annually enacted which Italian merchants and soldiers were after-wards to witness among their rude kindred, the Celts of Gaul, and which, if the Roman eagleshad ever swooped on Norway, might have been found repeated with little difference amongthe barbarous Aryans of the North. The rite was probably an essential feature in the ancientAryan worship of the oak.It only remains to ask, Why was the mistletoe called the Golden Bough? The whitish-yellow ofthe mistletoe berries is hardly enough to account for the name, for Virgil says that the boughwas altogether golden, stems as well as leaves. Perhaps the name may be derived from therich golden yellow which a bough of mistletoe assumes when it has been cut and kept forsome months; the bright tint is not confined to the leaves, but spreads to the stalks as well,so that the whole branch appears to be indeed a Golden Bough. Breton peasants hang upgreat bunches of mistletoe in front of their cottages, and in the month of June these bunchesare conspicuous for the bright golden tinge of their foliage. In some parts of Brittany, especial-ly about Morbihan, branches of mistletoe are hung over the doors of stables and byres to pro-tect the horses and cattle, probably against witchcraft.The yellow colour of the withered bough may partly explain why the mistletoe has beensometimes supposed to possess the property of disclosing treasures in the earth; for on theprinciples of homoeopathic magic there is a natural affinity between a yellow bough and yel-low gold. This suggestion is confirmed by the analogy of the marvellous properties popularlyascribed to the mythical fern-seed, which is popularly supposed to bloom like gold or fire onMidsummer Eve. Thus in Bohemia it is said that “on St. John’s Day fern-seed blooms withgolden blossoms that gleam like fire.” Now it is a property of this mythical fern-seed that who-ever has it, or will ascend a mountain holding it in his hand on Midsummer Eve, will discovera vein of gold or will see the treasures of the earth shining with a bluish flame. In Russia theysay that if you succeed in catching the wondrous bloom of the fern at midnight on MidsummerEve, you have only to throw it up into the air, and it will fall like a star on the very spot wherea treasure lies hidden. In Brittany treasure-seekers gather fern-seed at midnight onMidsummer Eve, and keep it till Palm Sunday of the following year; then they strew the seedon the ground where they think a treasure is concealed. Tyrolese peasants imagine that hid-den treasures can be seen glowing like flame on Midsummer Eve, and that fern-seed, gath-ered at this mystic season, with the usual precautions, will help to bring the buried gold to thesurface. In the Swiss canton of Freiburg people used to watch beside a fern on St. John’snight in the hope of winning a treasure, which the devil himself sometimes brought to them. InBohemia they say that he who procures the golden bloom of the fern at this season hasthereby the key to all hidden treasures; and that if maidens will spread a cloth under the fast-fading bloom, red gold will drop into it. And in the Tryol and Bohemia if you place fern-seedamong money, the money will never decrease, however much of it you spend. Sometimes thePage 540"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"fern-seed is supposed to bloom on Christmas night, and whoever catches it will become veryrich. In Styria they say that by gathering fern-seed on Christmas night you can force the devilto bring you a bag of money.Thus, on the principle of like by like, fern-seed is supposed to discover gold because it isitself golden; and for a similar reason it enriches its possessor with an unfailing supply ofgold. But while the fern-seed is described as golden, it is equally described as glowing andfiery. Hence, when we consider that two great days for gathering the fabulous seed areMidsummer Eve and Christmas—that is, the two solstices (for Christmas is nothing but an oldheathen celebration of the winter solstice)—we are led to regard the fiery aspect of the fern-seed as primary, and its golden aspect as secondary and derivative. Fern-seed, in fact, wouldseem to be an emanation of the sun’s fire at the two turning-points of its course, the summerand winter solstices. This view is confirmed by a German story in which a hunter is said tohave procured fern-seed by shooting at the sun on Midsummer Day at noon; three drops ofblood fell down, which he caught in a white cloth, and these blood-drops were the fern-seed.Here the blood is clearly the blood of the sun, from which the fern-seed is thus directlyderived. Thus it may be taken as probable that fern-seed is golden, because it is believed tobe an emanation of the sun’s golden fire.Now, like fern-seed, the mistletoe is gathered either at Midsummer or at Christmas—that is,either at the summer or at the winter solstice—and, like fern-seed, it is supposed to possessthe power of revealing treasures in the earth. On Midsummer Eve people in Sweden makedivining-rods of mistletoe, or of four different kinds of wood one of which must be mistletoe.The treasure-seeker places the rod on the ground after sundown, and when it rests directlyover treasure, the rod begins to move as if it were alive. Now, if the mistletoe discovers gold,it must be in its character of the Golden Bough; and if it is gathered at the solstices, must notthe Golden Bough, like the golden fern-seed, be an emanation of the sun’s fire? The questioncannot be answered with a simple affirmative. We have seen that the old Aryans perhaps kin-dled the solstitial and other ceremonial fires in part as sun-charms, that is, with the intentionof supplying the sun with fresh fire; and as these fires were usually made by the friction orcombustion of oak-wood, it may have appeared to the ancient Aryan that the sun was periodi-cally recruited from the fire which resided in the sacred oak. In other words, the oak mayhave seemed to him the original storehouse or reservoir of the fire which was from time totime drawn out to feed the sun. But if the life of the oak was conceived to be in the mistletoe,the mistletoe must on that view have contained the seed or germ of the fire which was elicitedby friction from the wood of the oak. Thus, instead of saying that the mistletoe was an ema-nation of the sun’s fire, it might be more correct to say that the sun’s fire was regarded as anemanation of the mistletoe. No wonder, then, that the mistletoe shone with a golden splen-dour, and was called the Golden Bough. Probably, however, like fern-seed, it was thought toassume its golden aspect only at those stated times, especially midsummer, when fire wasdrawn from the oak to light up the sun. At Pulverbatch, in Shropshire, it was believed withinliving memory that the oak-tree blooms on Midsummer Eve and the blossom withers beforedaylight. A maiden who wishes to know her lot in marriage should spread a white cloth underthe tree at night, and in the morning she will find a little dust, which is all that remains of theflower. She should place the pinch of dust under her pillow, and then her future husband willappear to her in her dreams. This fleeting bloom of the oak, if I am right, was probably themistletoe in its character of the Golden Bough. The conjecture is confirmed by the observa-tion that in Wales a real sprig of mistletoe gathered on Midsummer Eve is similarly placedunder the pillow to induce prophetic dreams; and further the mode of catching the imaginarybloom of the oak in a white cloth is exactly that which was employed by the Druids to catchPage 541"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"the real mistletoe when it dropped from the bough of the oak, severed by the golden sickle.As Shropshire borders on Wales, the belief that the oak blooms on Midsummer Eve may beWelsh in its immediate origin, though probably the belief is a fragment of the primitive Aryancreed. In some parts of Italy, as we saw, peasants still go out on Midsummer morning tosearch the oak-trees for the “oil of St. John,” which, like the mistletoe, heals all wounds, andis, perhaps, the mistletoe itself in its glorified aspect. Thus it is easy to understand how a titlelike the Golden Bough, so little descriptive of its usual appearance on the tree, should havebeen applied to the seemingly insignificant parasite. Further, we can perhaps see why inantiquity mistletoe was believed to possess the remarkable property of extinguishing fire, andwhy in Sweden it is still kept in houses as a safeguard against conflagration. Its fiery naturemarks it out, on homoeopathic principles, as the best possible cure or preventive of injury byfire.These considerations may partially explain why Virgil makes Aeneas carry a glorified boughof mistletoe with him on his descent into the gloomy subterranean world. The poet describeshow at the very gates of hell there stretched a vast and gloomy wood, and how the hero, fol-lowing the flight of two doves that lured him on, wandered into the depths of the immemorialforest till he saw afar off through the shadows of the trees the flickering light of the GoldenBough illuminating the matted boughs overhead. If the mistletoe, as a yellow withered boughin the sad autumn woods, was conceived to contain the seed of fire, what better companioncould a forlorn wanderer in the nether shades take with him than a bough that would be alamp to his feet as well as a rod and staff to his hands? Armed with it he might boldly confrontthe dreadful spectres that would cross his path on his adventurous journey. Hence whenAeneas, emerging from the forest, comes to the banks of Styx, winding slow with sluggishstream through the infernal marsh, and the surly ferryman refuses him passage in his boat,he has but to draw the Golden Bough from his bosom and hold it up, and straightway theblusterer quails at the sight and meekly receives the hero into his crazy bark, which sinksdeep in the water under the unusual weight of the living man. Even in recent times, as wehave seen, mistletoe has been deemed a protection against witches and trolls, and theancients may well have credited it with the same magical virtue. And if the parasite can, assome of our peasants believe, open all locks, why should it not have served as an “openSesame” in the hands of Aeneas to unlock the gates of death?Now, too, we can conjecture why Virbius at Nemi came to be confounded with the sun. IfVirbius was, as I have tried to show, a tree-spirit, he must have been the spirit of the oak onwhich grew the Golden Bough; for tradition represented him as the first of the Kings of theWood. As an oak-spirit he must have been supposed periodically to rekindle the sun’s fire,and might therefore easily be confounded with the sun itself. Similarly we can explain whyBalder, an oak-spirit, was described as “so fair of face and so shining that a light went forthfrom him,” and why he should have been so often taken to be the sun. And in general wemay say that in primitive society, when the only known way of making fire is by the friction ofwood, the savage must necessarily conceive of fire as a property stored away, like sap orjuice, in trees, from which he has laboriously to extract it. The Senal Indians of California “pro-fess to believe that the whole world was once a globe of fire, whence that element passed upinto the trees, and now comes out whenever two pieces of wood are rubbed together.”Similarly the Maidu Indians of California hold that “the earth was primarily a globe of moltenmatter, and from that the principle of fire ascended through the roots into the trunk andbranches of trees, whence the Indians can extract it by means of their drill.” In Namoluk, oneof the Caroline Islands, they say that the art of making fire was taught men by the gods.Olofaet, the cunning master of flames, gave fire to the bird mwi and bade him carry it to earthPage 542"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"in his bill. So the bird flew from tree to tree and stored away the slumbering force of the fire inthe wood, from which men can elicit it by friction. In the ancient Vedic hymns of India the fire-god Agni “is spoken of as born in wood, as the embryo of plants, or as distributed in plants.He is also said to have entered into all plants or to strive after them. When he is called theembryo of trees or of trees as well as plants, there may be a side-glance at the fire producedin forests by the friction of the boughs of trees.”Atree which has been struck by lightning is naturally regarded by the savage as charged witha double or triple portion of fire; for has he not seen the mighty flash enter into the trunk withhis own eyes? Hence perhaps we may explain some of the many superstitious beliefs con-cerning trees that have been struck by lightning. When the Thompson Indians of BritishColumbia wished to set fire to the houses of their enemies, they shot at them arrows whichwere either made from a tree that had been struck by lightning or had splinters of such woodattached to them. Wendish peasants of Saxony refuse to burn in their stoves the wood oftrees that have been struck by lightning; they say that with such fuel the house would beburnt down. In like manner the Thonga of South Africa will not use such wood as fuel norwarm themselves at a fire which has been kindled with it. On the contrary, when lightning setsfire to a tree, the Winamwanga of Northern Rhodesia put out all the fires in the village andplaster the fireplaces afresh, while the head men convey the lightning-kindled fire to the chief,who prays over it. The chief then sends out the new fire to all his villages, and the villagersreward his messengers for the boon. This shows that they look upon fire kindled by lightningwith reverence, and the reverence is intelligible, for they speak of thunder and lightning asGod himself coming down to earth. Similarly the Maidu Indians of California believe that aGreat Man created the world and all its inhabitants, and that lightning is nothing but the GreatMan himself descending swiftly out of heaven and rending the trees with his flaming arms.It is a plausible theory that the reverence which the ancient peoples of Europe paid to theoak, and the connexion which they traced between the tree and their sky-god, were derivedfrom the much greater frequency with which the oak appears to be struck by lightning thanany other tree of our European forests. This peculiarity of the tree has seemingly been estab-lished by a series of observations instituted within recent years by scientific enquirers whohave no mythological theory to maintain. However we may explain it, whether by the easierpassage of electricity through oak-wood than through any other timber, or in some other way,the fact itself may well have attracted the notice of our rude forefathers, who dwelt in the vastforests which then covered a large part of Europe; and they might naturally account for it intheir simple religious way by supposing that the great sky-god, whom they worshipped andwhose awful voice they heard in the roll of thunder, loved the oak above all the trees of thewood and often descended into it from the murky cloud in a flash of lightning, leaving a tokenof his presence or of his passage in the riven and blackened trunk and the blasted foliage.Such trees would thenceforth be encircled by a nimbus of glory as the visible seats of thethundering sky-god. Certain it is that, like some savages, both Greeks and Romans identifiedtheir great god of the sky and of the oak with the lightning flash which struck the ground; andthey regularly enclosed such a stricken spot and treated it thereafter as sacred. It is not rashto suppose that the ancestors of the Celts and Germans in the forests of Central Europe paida like respect for like reasons to a blasted oak.This explanation of the Aryan reverence for the oak and of the association of the tree with thegreat god of the thunder and the sky, was suggested or implied long ago by Jacob Grimm,and has been in recent years powerfully reinforced by Mr. W. Warde Fowler. It appears to besimpler and more probable than the explanation which I formerly adopted, namely, that thePage 543"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"oak was worshipped primarily for the many benefits which our rude forefathers derived fromthe tree, particularly for the fire which they drew by friction from its wood; and that the con-nexion of the oak with the sky was an after-thought based on the belief that the flash of light-ning was nothing but the spark which the sky-god up aloft elicited by rubbing two pieces ofoak-wood against each other, just as his savage worshipper kindled fire in the forest on earth.On that theory the god of the thunder and the sky was derived from the original god of theoak; on the present theory, which I now prefer, the god of the sky and the thunder was thegreat original deity of our Aryan ancestors, and his association with the oak was merely aninference based on the frequency with which the oak was seen to be struck by lightning. If theAryans, as some think, roamed the wide steppes of Russia or Central Asia with their flocksand herds before they plunged into the gloom of the European forests, they may have wor-shipped the god of the blue or cloudy firmament and the flashing thunderbolt long before theythought of associating him with the blasted oaks in their new home.Perhaps the new theory has the further advantage of throwing light on the special sanctityascribed to mistletoe which grows on an oak. The mere rarity of such a growth on an oakhardly suffices to explain the extent and the persistence of the superstition. A hint of its realorigin is possibly furnished by the statement of Pliny that the Druids worshipped the plantbecause they believed it to have fallen from heaven and to be a token that the tree on whichit grew was chosen by the god himself. Can they have thought that the mistletoe dropped onthe oak in a flash of lightning? The conjecture is confirmed by the name thunder-besom whichis applied to mistletoe in the Swiss canton of Aargau, for the epithet clearly implies a closeconnexion between the parasite and the thunder; indeed “thunder-besom” is a popular namein Germany for any bushy nest-like excrescence growing on a branch, because such a para-sitic growth is actually believed by the ignorant to be a product of lightning. If there is anytruth in this conjecture, the real reason why the Druids worshipped a mistletoe-bearing oakabove all other trees of the forest was a belief that every such oak had not only been struckby lightning but bore among its branches a visible emanation of the celestial fire; so that incutting the mistletoe with mystic rites they were securing for themselves all the magical prop-erties of a thunder-bolt. If that was so, we must apparently conclude that the mistletoe wasdeemed an emanation of the lightning rather than, as I have thus far argued, of the midsum-mer sun. Perhaps, indeed, we might combine the two seemingly divergent views by suppos-ing that in the old Aryan creed the mistletoe descended from the sun on Midsummer Day in aflash of lightning. But such a combination is artificial and unsupported, so far as I know, byany positive evidence. Whether on mythical principles the two interpretations can really bereconciled with each other or not, I will not presume to say; but even should they prove to bediscrepant, the inconsistency need not have prevented our rude forefathers from embracingboth of them at the same time with an equal fervour of conviction; for like the great majority ofmankind the savage is above being hidebound by the trammels of a pedantic logic. Inattempting to track his devious thought through the jungle of crass ignorance and blind fear,we must always remember that we are treading enchanted ground, and must beware of tak-ing for solid realities the cloudy shapes that cross our path or hover and gibber at us throughthe gloom. We can never completely replace ourselves at the standpoint of primitive man, seethings with his eyes, and feel our hearts beat with the emotions that stirred his. All our theo-ries concerning him and his ways must therefore fall far short of certainty; the utmost we canaspire to in such matters is a reasonable degree of probability.To conclude these enquiries we may say that if Balder was indeed, as I have conjectured, apersonification of a mistletoe—bearing oak, his death by a blow of the mistletoe might on thenew theory be explained as a death by a stroke of lightning. So long as the mistletoe, inPage 544"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"which the flame of the lightning smouldered, was suffered to remain among the boughs, solong no harm could befall the good and kindly god of the oak, who kept his life stowed awayfor safety between earth and heaven in the mysterious parasite; but when once that seat ofhis life, or of his death, was torn from the branch and hurled at the trunk, the tree fell—thegod died—smitten by a thunderbolt.And what we have said of Balder in the oak forests of Scandinavia may perhaps, with all duediffidence in a question so obscure and uncertain, be applied to the priest of Diana, the Kingof the Wood, at Aricia in the oak forests of Italy. He may have personated in flesh and bloodthe great Italian god of the sky, Jupiter, who had kindly come down from heaven in the light-ning flash to dwell among men in the mistletoe—the thunder—besom—the Golden Bough—growing on the sacred oak in the dells of Nemi. If that was so, we need not wonder that thepriest guarded with drawn sword the mystic bough which contained the god’s life and hisown. The goddess whom he served and married was herself, if I am right, no other than theQueen of Heaven, the true wife of the sky-god. For she, too, loved the solitude of the woodsand the lonely hills, and sailing overhead on clear nights in the likeness of the silver moonlooked down with pleasure on her own fair image reflected on the calm, the burnished surfaceof the lake, Diana’s Mirror.Chapter LXIXFarewell to NemiWE are at the end of our enquiry, but as often happens in the search after truth, if we haveanswered one question, we have raised many more; if we have followed one track home, wehave had to pass by others that opened off it and led, or seemed to lead, to far other goalsthan the sacred grove at Nemi. Some of these paths we have followed a little way; others, iffortune should be kind, the writer and the reader may one day pursue together. For the pres-ent we have journeyed far enough together, and it is time to part. Yet before we do so, wemay well ask ourselves whether there is not some more general conclusion, some lesson, ifpossible, of hope and encouragement, to be drawn from the melancholy record of humanerror and folly which has engaged our attention in this book.If then we consider, on the one hand, the essential similarity of man’s chief wants everywhereand at all times, and on the other hand, the wide difference between the means he hasadopted to satisfy them in different ages, we shall perhaps be disposed to conclude that themovement of the higher thought, so far as we can trace it, has on the whole been from magicthrough religion to science. In magic man depends on his own strength to meet the difficultiesand dangers that beset him on every side. He believes in a certain established order ofnature on which he can surely count, and which he can manipulate for his own ends. Whenhe discovers his mistake, when he recognises sadly that both the order of nature which hehad assumed and the control which he had believed himself to exercise over it were purelyimaginary, he ceases to rely on his own intelligence and his own unaided efforts, and throwshimself humbly on the mercy of certain great invisible beings behind the veil of nature, towhom he now ascribes all those far-reaching powers which he once arrogated to himself.Thus in the acuter minds magic is gradually superseded by religion, which explains the suc-cession of natural phenomena as regulated by the will, the passion, or the caprice of spiritualbeings like man in kind, though vastly superior to him in power.But as time goes on this explanation in its turn proves to be unsatisfactory. For it assumesthat the succession of natural events is not determined by immutable laws, but is to somePage 545"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"extent variable and irregular, and this assumption is not borne out by closer observation. Onthe contrary, the more we scrutinise that succession the more we are struck by the rigid uni-formity, the punctual precision with which, wherever we can follow them, the operations ofnature are carried on. Every great advance in knowledge has extended the sphere of orderand correspondingly restricted the sphere of apparent disorder in the world, till now we areready to anticipate that even in regions where chance and confusion appear still to reign, afuller knowledge would everywhere reduce the seeming chaos to cosmos. Thus the keenerminds, still pressing forward to a deeper solution of the mysteries of the universe, come toreject the religious theory of nature as inadequate, and to revert in a measure to the olderstandpoint of magic by postulating explicitly, what in magic had only been implicitly assumed,to wit, an inflexible regularity in the order of natural events, which, if carefully observed,enables us to foresee their course with certainty and to act accordingly. In short, religion,regarded as an explanation of nature, is displaced by science.But while science has this much in common with magic that both rest on a faith in order asthe underlying principle of all things, readers of this work will hardly need to be reminded thatthe order presupposed by magic differs widely from that which forms the basis of science.The difference flows naturally from the different modes in which the two orders have beenreached. For whereas the order on which magic reckons is merely an extension, by falseanalogy, of the order in which ideas present themselves to our minds, the order laid down byscience is derived from patient and exact observation of the phenomena themselves. Theabundance, the solidity, and the splendour of the results already achieved by science are wellfitted to inspire us with a cheerful confidence in the soundness of its method. Here at last,after groping about in the dark for countless ages, man has hit upon a clue to the labyrinth, agolden key that opens many locks in the treasury of nature. It is probably not too much to saythat the hope of progress—moral and intellectual as well as material—in the future is boundup with the fortunes of science, and that every obstacle placed in the way of scientific discov-ery is a wrong to humanity.Yet the history of thought should warn us against concluding that because the scientific theoryof the world is the best that has yet been formulated, it is necessarily complete and final. Wemust remember that at bottom the generalisations of science or, in common parlance, thelaws of nature are merely hypotheses devised to explain that ever-shifting phantasmagoria ofthought which we dignify with the high-sounding names of the world and the universe. In thelast analysis magic, religion, and science are nothing but theories of thought; and as sciencehas supplanted its predecessors, so it may hereafter be itself superseded by some more per-fect hypothesis, perhaps by some totally different way of looking at the phenomena—of regis-tering the shadows on the screen—of which we in this generation can form no idea. Theadvance of knowledge is an infinite progression towards a goal that for ever recedes. Weneed not murmur at the endless pursuit: Fatti non foste a viver come bruti Ma per seguir virtute e conoscenza.Great things will come of that pursuit, though we may not enjoy them. Brighter stars will riseon some voyager of the future—some great Ulysses of the realms of thought—than shine onus. The dreams of magic may one day be the waking realities of science. But a dark shadowlies athwart the far end of this fair prospect. For however vast the increase of knowledge andof power which the future may have in store for man, he can scarcely hope to stay the sweepof those great forces which seem to be making silently but relentlessly for the destruction ofPage 546"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"all this starry universe in which our earth swims as a speck or mote. In the ages to come manmay be able to predict, perhaps even to control, the wayward courses of the winds andclouds, but hardly will his puny hands have strength to speed afresh our slackening planet inits orbit or rekindle the dying fire of the sun. Yet the philosopher who trembles at the idea ofsuch distant catastrophes may console himself by reflecting that these gloomy apprehen-sions, like the earth and the sun themselves, are only parts of that unsubstantial world whichthought has conjured up out of the void, and that the phantoms which the subtle enchantresshas evoked to-day she may ban tomorrow. They too, like so much that to common eyesseems solid, may melt into air, into thin air.Without dipping so far into the future, we may illustrate the course which thought has hithertorun by likening it to a web woven of three different threads—the black thread of magic, thered thread of religion, and the white thread of science, if under science we may include thosesimple truths, drawn from observation of nature, of which men in all ages have possessed astore. Could we then survey the web of thought from the beginning, we should probably per-ceive it to be at first a chequer of black and white, a patchwork of true and false notions,hardly tinged as yet by the red thread of religion. But carry your eye farther along the fabricand you will remark that, while the black and white chequer still runs through it, there rests onthe middle portion of the web, where religion has entered most deeply into its texture, a darkcrimson stain, which shades off insensibly into a lighter tint as the white thread of science iswoven more and more into the tissue. To a web thus chequered and stained, thus shot withthreads of diverse hues, but gradually changing colour the farther it is unrolled, the state ofmodern thought, with all its divergent aims and conflicting tendencies, may be compared. Willthe great movement which for centuries has been slowly altering the complexion of thoughtbe continued in the near future? or will a reaction set in which may arrest progress and evenundo much that has been done? To keep up our parable, what will be the colour of the webwhich the Fates are now weaving on the humming loom of time? will it be white or red? Wecannot tell. A faint glimmering light illumines the backward portion of the web. Clouds andthick darkness hide the other end.Our long voyage of discovery is over and our bark has drooped her weary sails in port at last.Once more we take the road to Nemi. It is evening, and as we climb the long slope of theAppian Way up to the Alban Hills, we look back and see the sky aflame with sunset, its gold-en glory resting like the aureole of a dying saint over Rome and touching with a crest of firethe dome of St. Peter’s. The sight once seen can never be forgotten, but we turn from it andpursue our way darkling along the mountain side, till we come to Nemi and look down on thelake in its deep hollow, now fast disappearing in the evening shadows. The place haschanged but little since Diana received the homage of her worshippers in the sacred grove.The temple of the sylvan goddess, indeed, has vanished and the King of the Wood no longerstands sentinel over the Golden Bough. But Nemi’s woods are still green, and as the sunsetfades above them in the west, there comes to us, borne on the swell of the wind, the soundof the church bells of Aricia ringing the Angelus. Ave Maria! Sweet and solemn they chime outfrom the distant town and die lingeringly away across the wide Campagnan marshes. Le roiest mort, vive le roi! Ave Maria!Page 547"}]
