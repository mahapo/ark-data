Catherine M. Bell's profound insight was that ritual, longunderstood as thoughtless action stripped of context, is more interestinglyunderstood as strategy: a culturally strategic way of acting in the world.Ritual is a form of social activity. This argument is meticulously establishedand beautifully presented in the chapters that follow. Unfolding like a com-manding lecture, Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice remains Catherine's great-est contribution to the study of religion.This book, in many ways, constitutes one part of what Anthony Gid-dens would call the \"front and back regions\" of any scholarly life. RitualTheory, Ritual Practice presents the theories and observations that Cath-erine placed \"front\" and center for all to see. Explicit in her life but alsoembedded in this book, however, are other lessons. They linger in the \"backregion,\" so to speak, for someone to notice and point out.These lessons are strikingly visible to me because, for thirty yearsCatherine Bell was a friend, a mentor, and an inspiration to me. I met herfirst at the University of Chicago in the late 'yos when we were graduatestudents at the Divinity School. I was studying Freud, Rorschach, andreligion; she was studying Chinese morality books. Hearing her presenther research in Joseph Kitagawa's seminar, was an \"aha experience\" forme: \"So that's how to do a seminar presentation!\" I found myself tak-ing notes on how she organized her material and presented her thesis. In1985 Catherine joined the Religious Studies department at Santa ClaraUniversity where I had been teaching for a year, and that graduate school\"aha experience\" deepened into a close friendship. During our years ascolleagues, I found myself continuing to take notes on Catherine's way ofthinking, working, and living - her \"practices\" until her death in 2008.Note i: Don't be constrained by the present or the past.Catherine had a remarkable ability to think beyond the frame of both currentdiscourse and past practice. While many scholars recount the debates thathave shaped their field and make a small contribution to move the discourse"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"viii Foreword: Notes on a Friendshipforward, she transformed the way that scholars in our field think and write.She sketched out contemporary debates, traced historical lineages, and thentook stunning conceptual leaps, rearranging pieces in entirely new, and thor-oughly enlightening, ways. There's a fearlessness to her work. She speaksthe truth, unconstrained by concerns about critical reactions - an importantlesson for those whose schooling in tact and diplomacy can place limits oncreative vision.Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice illustrates well her fearless intellectualstyle and her sense of freedom from past constructions. The book receivedthe award for the \"Best First Book in the History of Religions\" in 1994,and has redirected the thinking of the discipline. One cannot write on ritualtoday without citing her work. Her ability to perceive the current topogra-phy and see beyond the horizon inspires me still.Note 2: Look for large patterns and ask big questions.Catherine's practice of asking big questions and seeking large patterns isclearly visible in her work; it was evident in her course development andpedagogy as well. She structured every course around a compelling intel-lectual question that would both capture the interest of her students andtackle an unresolved problem in the discipline. Her students - all under-graduates - participated in creating scholarly trajectories, sorting throughdata, discerning patterns, and struggling to find answers. Whether teachingmethodology in \"Ways of Studying Religion,\" area studies in \"Asian Reli-gions,\" or advanced courses like \"Magic, Science and Religion,\" \"Time andthe Millennium,\" or \"Religion and Violence,\" she challenged and inspiredher students to ask real questions, to understand the significance of thosequestions for the contemporary world, and to perceive the larger patternsemerging from texts and practices.Always attentive to the patterns in how students learn, it was Cath-erine who first brought me a copy of Benjamin Bloom's taxonomy ofcognitive development: she had designed a series of assignments to guidestudents toward increasingly sophisticated thinking, challenging them tomove from comparison to interpretation, and then to analysis and evalua-tion. She suggested that in the classroom \"nothing stands alone\" - everytext must be carefully paired with another so that students can tease outcontradictions and develop new syntheses. And she created guidelines on\"how to read a book when you're not reading it for pleasure.\" Her instruc-tions started with self awareness and self inquiry: \"What are your ques-tions?\" Next, she instructed, one must ask about the author as \"Other\":\"What is the author's intent?\" Finally, she directed her students to inte-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Foreword: Notes on a Friendship ixgrate self understanding and close reading of the text by \"engaging incritical reflection and creative response.\" Her guidelines worked: her stu-dents were truly touched by the books they read with her. They producedremarkable work in her courses, and they carried newly developed criticaland creative abilities into other courses, into graduate programs, and intolife beyond the academy.Note 3: Transform the personal into the professional.Catherine was a master at understanding how individual questions or prob-lems could be addressed through structural changes. Her legacy in thisregard is visible within a number of lasting structures at Santa Clara. Expe-riencing a need for greater community among women she created a still-thriving Women's Faculty Group. Perceiving a need for mentoring of juniorfaculty she urged the creation of a now flourishing Faculty DevelopmentProgram. Struggling within a hierarchical administrative structure, she leda movement to transform university governance and decision-making into asystem that garnered a 1998 Ralph S. Brown Award for Shared Governancefrom the American Association of University Professors. She consistentlyused her own experience as a spark to ignite creative thinking and buildcommunity.Catherine left behind an unfinished manuscript, Believing and thePractice of Religion, in which she wrote, \"An investigation of a topicshould begin with an exploration of why that topic warrants one's inter-est in the first place An investigator should understand why the topicconstitutes a 'problem' - at least for her.\" She beautifully captures thisshift from personal to professional: \"Once I was a believer, thought-fully and intimately committed, and then I was no longer one, with adifferent set of thoughts and emotions. While I was able to 'explain'my believing and my not-believing in the popular Freudian patois ofthe day, I wanted to assemble a fuller picture of what had happened andexplore whether what was true for me might be useful for understand-ing others.\"And she proposed a new way of speaking about belief, a more selfconscious and critically reflexive analysis of the category of belief, aimingto change \"where our confidence lies\" when using the \"language of belief.\"Her goal: to create a conversation about \"how we think of ourselves.. .andhow we think about what we are doing with our inherited interpretive cat-egories.\" Catherine's unfinished manuscript will be available to scholarsthrough the archives of Santa Clara University's library."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"x Foreword: Notes on a FriendshipNote 4: Find pleasure in creativity.Catherine's creativity transcended her academic and scholarly contribu-tions. Her luminous spirit is vividly present in writings both playful andprofound drafted for more limited audiences. At the turn of the millen-nium, she wrote a \"Millennial Masque,\" a play in Shakespearean versefor a group of friends and colleagues to perform on New Year's Eve. Shewas to play \"The Scholar\"; I was to read the part of \"Madame Butterfly\"wearing a red silk kimono she had purchased in Japan. Her husband hadthe role of Cardinal Ex Corde; my husband was commissioned to be themusician for the performance. Other colleagues were assigned such rolesas: \"The Grim Reaper,\" \"The Keeper of the Clocks,\" and the \"OrphicChorus.\"The \"Masque\" was never performed. Tragically, Catherine spent thefirst night of the new millennium in the emergency room with the firstsymptoms of the multiple sclerosis that would shadow the last decade ofher life. The \"Millennial Masque\" captures her spirit beautifully: it's liter-ary, playful, and profound. It's about life, death, and love; beginnings andendings; and the desire for change. As if she anticipated her own life story,time and the millennium serve as metaphors for the presence of death in themidst of life:The time is upon us for a millennial shiftTo mark the moment -we offer this giftIf it be more beginning or endI cannot presume to suggest or pretendBut whether welcomed or welcomed notTis a moment of time not soon forgot...Time is what binds us and tears us apartBut for every ending we can attempt a new start.Writing in May 2009, just a year after her death, I am only too awarethat these notes on a friendship fail to capture the luminous reality of Cathe-rine's presence and practice. But I am immensely grateful to have had threedecades - an extended \"moment of time not soon forgot\" - to take notes onthe practice of a generous mentor, an inspiring colleague, and a dear friend.And I am honored to be a participant in the reissuing of this volume, anembodiment, in some sense, of Catherine's words: \"for every ending wecan attempt a new start.\"Diane Jonte-Pace, Santa Clara University"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Foreword: Notes on a Friendship xiBell, Catherine, 1999. \"A Millennial Masque: Wherein the Arbitrariness ofTime Reveals the Illusiveness of All Human Expectations.\" Unpublishedmanuscript.- No date.

The problems and issues engaged herewere first formulated for a dissertation chapter, but since then theyhave continued to intrude on several very different projects. I couldno longer resist the temptation to follow through on a few key ideasand see what might emerge, although I knew that as a book onritual, the project would display one obvious idiosyncrasy: ratherthan contributing to the conceptual integrity and scope of the notionof ritual, this book is designed to be something of a lightning rodfor the dilemmas of theory, analysis, and practice. The concept ofritual is not destroyed in the process, but I hope this study succeedsin shaking it up a little.Several very different scholars of religion and ritual have influ-enced my particular formulation of the \"problem\" of ritual. Durk-heim was the first such influence since I was exposed to the fullsweep of his Elementary Forms of the Religious Life very early inmy education. In defining religion as a formal object of theoreticaland comparative analysis, Durkheim laid out categories that I coulduse to locate my own experience of religion in the schools andchurches of pre—Vatican II Catholicism. Nonetheless, these cate-gories did not always fit, and I have argued with Durkheim in myhead ever since. In the end, it is with Durkheim's pragmatic for-mulation of religion as a matter of primary beliefs and secondaryrites that the battle is joined and my analysis of ritual begins. I haveenjoyed the prospect of a subsequent and complementary studygiving full attention to the problem of 'belief."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiv   PrefaceThe pedagogy and essays of Jonathan Z. Smith have been asecond influence. Many years ago, his argumentative assertion that\"ritual is work!\" raised innumerable questions for me about theconstruction and use of categories in the study of religion.8 Theelement of surprise in his statement came, of course, from the em-phasis on ritual as labor in contrast to the tendency to see ritual interms of symbolic or idealized expression. Aside from provocativeconnections to Marxist theories of labor, his inversion ultimatelysuggested that the more common perspective was supported by anunexamined logic, which made it seem immediately convincing andright. I began to trace how the categories and rhetoric mobilizedin standard approaches to ritual functioned to substantiate largerentities such as religion, society, or culture. Since then the \"dis-mantling\" of concepts like ritual and other deconstructive impulseshas become more fashionable.Another set of issues crystallized for me around the recent emer-gence of ritual studies as an independent and interdisciplinary fieldof study. As both an observer and participant at many conferencepanels I have been intrigued with the swelling of interest in ritual.The development of ritual studies as a distinct focus is clearly duein great part to the vision and efforts of a few individuals, partic-ularly Ronald Grimes. His sense of intellectual purpose and wide-ranging inquiry has effectively encouraged a dialogue among quitedifferent types of scholars. Yet the emergence and appeal of ritualstudies must also be rooted in other forces operative within aca-demic life. In the course of various formal discussions of ritual, Ibecame curious about the intellectual and practical imperatives thatwould foster the construction of a category, such as 'ritual', in sucha way as to organize and legitimize an independent discourse, ex-pertise, and scholarly identity. I wondered if ritual studies as suchcould survive a major reorganization of the notion of ritual.Writing this book has answered some but not all of the questionsI brought to the project. In the end I have been content to maketwo main arguments about ritual activity. First, after tracing someof the connections that can make a discourse on ritual seem socompelling and useful to studies of cultural activity, I contend thatfew if any of the current theories of ritual avoid a rather predeter-mined circularity. This circularity functions to constitute ritual asan object of analysis in such a way as to mandate a particular"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Preface   xvmethod, expertise, and way of knowing. Perhaps a similar conclu-sion could be reached about many other topics of study, but ritualis an interesting case study of these practices for several reasons.Most simply, ritual is so readily cast as action in opposition tothought and theory that the structuring effect of assumptions aboutthought and action can be traced with great clarity. Moreover, ritualstudies, as a recent mode of discourse, has claimed an odd exemp-tion from the general critique that scholarship distorts and exploits,tending to see itself, by virtue of its interest in ritual performancesper se, as somehow able to transcend the politics of those who studyand those who are studied.My second argument attempts to break free of the circularitythat has structured thinking about acting by undermining the verycategory of ritual itself. I abandon the focus on ritual as a set ofspecial practices in favor of a focus on some of the more commonstrategies of \"ritualization,\" initially defined as a way of acting thatdifferentiates some acts from others. To approach ritual within theframework of practical activity raises, I suggest, potentially morefruitful questions about the origins, purposes, and efficacy of \"ri-tualized actions\" than are accessible through current models.My critical appraisal of the theoretical literature on ritual andthe subsequent sketch of an alternative direction of inquiry attemptto address an impasse in ritual theory not unrecognized by others.It is probable that my alternative framework does not fully succeedin breaking free of the structures that have shaped thinking aboutritual. Yet I suspect that even this failure will illuminate somethingbasic about the constraints that are intrinsic to scholarly discourseon ritual and to the more general strategies by which we define andstructure an authoritative interpretation. In any case, for reasonsspelled out in the chapters that follow, I am not interested in pre-senting a systematic critique of all work on ritual or a new theoryof ritual in general. Neither am I concerned to make any pro-nouncements on the intrinsic value of studying ritual per se. Rather,I am launching an analytical exploration of the social existence ofthe concept of ritual, the values ascribed to it, and the ramificationsof these perspectives for scholarship.Preliminary versions of certain sections of this book appearedelsewhere.

Besidesanthropologists, sociologists, and historians of religion, there aresociobiologists, philosophers, and intellectual historians who haveturned to ritual as a \"window\" on the cultural dynamics by whichpeople make and remake their worlds. The result has been a rela-tively broad and interdisciplinary conversation known as \"ritualstudies.\" Certainly the notion of ritual has been central to researchin religion and society since the late nineteenth century, and fewother single terms have been more fundamental in defining the issuesbasic to culture, society, and religion. Now, however, ritual hasbecome a topic of interest in its own right, not merely a tool forunderstanding more embracing social phenomena. Indeed, ritualhas simultaneously become an object, a method, and even some-thing of a style of scholarship on the American academic scene.Given both the history and scope of the appeal to ritual as acategory of experience and analysis, the term is overdue for anextended critical rethinking. Jack Goody first addressed the stateof ritual theory in a definitive study published nearly thirty yearsago. Yet when he last addressed it in 1976, he expressed a dramaticloss of confidence in the formal category of ritual.9 Aside from hiscomments, there has been no sustained analysis of the term thatevaluates its role in our thinking on religion, society, and culture.10Nor has there been any concomitant assessment of the underlyingproblems engaged by the term 'ritual' and the structure this categoryimposes on theoretical discourse.3"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"4  IntroductionThis book undertakes such an analysis in two ways: first, througha critical reading of how the notion of ritual has been used in thestudy of religion, society, and culture; and second, through an at-tempt to carve out an approach to ritual activities that is less en-cumbered by assumptions about thinking and acting and moredisclosing of the strategies by which ritualized activities do whatthey do. I do not provide a comprehensive history of the term, areview of the most famous ethnographic examples, or a revisedtheory of ritual—useful though these projects might be. The pur-pose of this book is both more ambitious and more pragmatic—to reassess what we have been doing with the category of ritual,why we have ended up where we are, and how we might formulatean analytic direction better able to grasp how such activities com-pare to other forms of social action.The sections that follow concentrate on a broad but selective setof influential theories about ritual. My discussion remains focusedon an explicitly theoretical level of reflection about ritual ratherthan one more linked to ethnographic data. While many theoriescome embedded in particular ethnographic studies, none confinethemselves to interpreting just the rites of a particular group. Theyall generalize in order to discuss ritual action per se. Since I amconcerned with the most basic assumptions and tendencies in think-ing about ritual activities, the analyses that follow also remain ratherabstract. My starting point is not some objective instance of ritualactivity that I attempt to interpret, such as Vedic ritual or the gardenmagic of the Trobriand Islanders. Rather, my starting point is anexploration of what makes us identify some acts as ritual, whatsuch a category does for the production and organization of knowl-edge about other cultures, and how we might assess the assumptionsthat create and constrain the notion of ritual. Truly thick ethno-graphic descriptions of particular rites rarely succumb to the sys-tematic division of human experience evidenced in theoreticalstudies. When they do, it is frequently due to the influence of cat-egories developed to empower theoretical discourse. The divergencebetween theoretical formulations and descriptive studies is germaneto the issues raised here, but a fuller treatment is regrettably beyondthe scope of this book.11In addition to analyzing the category of ritual and proposinganother framework within which to assess ritual activity, this book"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction  5has a third level of concern. In arguing how categories of ritualpractice have been used to define objects and methods of theoreticalpractice, I raise questions about the dynamics of theoretical practiceas such. By dismantling ritual as a theoretical construct, it is possibleto uncover some of the more hidden but decisive practices by whicha body of theoretical knowledge is generated and theoretical activityis differentiated from other forms of social activity. As part of itsexploration of ritual, therefore, this book initiates a foray beyondthe customary confines of ritual theory to suggest some of the strat-egies basic to other forms of practice and the social relationshipsthese practices support.The intellectual framework for 'doing theory' has shifted dra-matically in the last twenty years. The premises and boundaries ofthe theoretical enterprise have undergone a wave of challenges, aperiodic but no less traumatic experience, leaving us to wonder howand what we can know. This series of challenges has generated anopen debate on the social and political ramifications of particularforms of knowing.11 Some consensus has emerged from this debatethat critical analysis of a theoretical perspective must look not onlyto the logic of the set of ideas under scrutiny, but also to the historyof their construction.13 In addition, a critical analysis must alsoincorporate a reflexive awareness of the conditions under which itoperates to constitute meaningful interpretation/4 In this era oftheoretical practice, therefore, we are \"rethinking\" entire concep-tual constructions handed down within our fields of inquiry.15 Anythorough process of rethinking these basic concepts appears to in-volve three closely related operations: first, a deconstruction of thehistorical definitions of the problem or issue and a delineation ofthe circumstances under which the problem has been a problem forus; second, the proposal of an interpretive perspective on the issuethat enables our cultural categories seriously to engage and be en-gaged by the material addressed; and third, an extension of thisperspective to real applications and examples in order to explorerelationships among hitherto unrelated issues.16In rethinking ritual these operations form three stages of theargument that spans the following sections. The first stage disclosesthe construction of ritual as an object of analysis and thereby revealsthe problems for us that have been embodied in the term and dis-course on it. The second stage formulates an interpretation of this"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"6  Introductionproblem that reflexively provides an analysis of its own conditionsas an interpretation. And the third stage, by applying this inter-pretation to a field of interrelated issues, attempts to generate anopen but coherent framework for seeing new relationships amongtraditional issues, without losing sight of the contingent and deter-mined nature of this framework.More specifically, the chapters in Part I take up the initial taskof a critical theory of ritual by addressing the construction of thecategory itself and the role this construction has played in organizinga broad discourse on religion, society, and culture. Despite thedifferences among historians of religion, sociologists, and anthro-pologists, their theories of ritual all similarly function to resolvethe complex problems posed by an initial bifurcation of thoughtand action. Indeed, theoretical discourse about ritual is organizedas a coherent whole by virtue of a logic based on the oppositionof thought and action. This argument suggests that, historically,the whole issue of ritual arose as a discrete phenomenon to the eyesof social observers in that period in which 'reason' and the scientificpursuit of knowledge were defining a particular hegemony in West-ern intellectual life.Given such a sociohistorical and logical-practical context for theterm \"ritual\" as a category of experience and of analysis, a questionarises: Can there be any argument for continuing to ascribe validityto the term? Goody, as noted earlier, sees no further usefulness ina \"global construct\" like ritual and has seriously called for its re-tirement in favor of a revitalizing \"paradigm shift.\"17 Although itis interesting to imagine a paradigm shift, any number of problemsbeset the attempt to jettison an older category, whether it be toimpose a new one or simply to clear the field. There is hardly aconsensus, first of all, about the inadequacy of the term ritual. Itis still being used widely both by the general public and by manyacademic disciplines less immediately concerned with the problemsthat attend it. In fact, the popularity of the term and the topic,evidenced in ritual studies, reflects the very success scholars havehad in securing the retirement of older and more obviously prob-lematic terms. That is, ritual has replaced terms such as 'liturgy'versus 'magic', which were used to distinguish high religion fromprimitive superstition or our ritual from theirs. To try to discardthe term ritual just when scholars have been successful in popular-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction  jizing its use would imply a desire for esoteric categories accessibleonly to the cognoscenti.Such housecleaning could also undermine any thorough explo-ration of how and why the term has become problematic. It is farfrom clear that a quickly summoned paradigm shift could solveeither our immediate problems or the more buried ones they restupon. Many attempts to produce a paradigm shift end up simplyrepackaging older problems in new jargon. Rather than eventuallyfind that the disgraced presuppositions of the abandoned term haveresurfaced in a newly deployed set of categories, it seems moreresponsible to hold on to our battered terminology, just as we holdon to the artifacts of our own personal histories no matter howdifficult they might become. They ensure that we do not forgetwhere we come from. They curb our pretenses. We may decide totailor our terms with annotations or hyphenations, but it would beill-advised to pretend to abandon what has been so well internalized.A real revolution will not be accomplished by a mere change ofterms, nor will it be held off by modifying older ones. I do intendto modify the term ritual to function as something other than a\"global construct\" or \"a key to culture.\"18 Yet my close relianceupon current and preceding scholarship ensures continuity with thecommonsense notion of ritual while making explicit some of theassumptions and perspectives built into it. Given the analysis ofdiscourse on ritual presented in Part I, it becomes apparent thatrethinking ritual will yield less rather than more—less generality,less universality, and perhaps less of the trappings of persuasive,explanative power. This 'less-ness' may ultimately be more effectivein spurring a shift of paradigms than the introduction of newlydesigned terms.Part II, which takes on the second task of critical theorizing,proposes that so-called ritual activities be removed from their iso-lated position as special paradigmatic acts and restored to the con-text of social activity in general. Some attempts to see ritual associal praxis are analyzed, as are the stubborn difficulties encoun-tered by 'practice theory' in its attempt to transcend only the mostobvious forms of the thought—action dichotomy. In response, Ipropose a focus on 'ritualization' as a strategic way of acting andthen turn to explore how and why this way of acting differentiatesitself from other practices. When analyzed as ritualization, acting"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"8  Introductionritually emerges as a particular cultural strategy of differentiationlinked to particular social effects and rooted in a distinctive interplayof a socialized body and the environment it structures. The con-fusions that accompany attempts to distinguish clearly between riteand non-rite—those perennial obstacles to neat definitions and clas-sification—are revealed to be highly significant for understandingwhat ritualization does.Part III addresses the large body of theories that discuss ritual asa form of social control. In so doing it attempts to fulfill the thirdtask of a critical theory by applying an interpretation of ritualizationas a culturally strategic way of acting to several classic issues withinthe traditional study of ritual, namely, belief, ideology, legitimation,and power. The main argument suggests that ritualization is a strat-egy for the construction of a limited and limiting power relationship.This is not a relationship in which one social group has absolutecontrol over another, but one that simultaneously involves bothconsent and resistance, misunderstanding and appropriation. In ex-ploring how ritualized ways of acting negotiate authority, self, andsociety, I attempt to delineate something of the social dynamics bywhich all activity reproduces and manipulates its own contextualground.As a particular reading of much of what has been written onritual, this book is neither an objective nor a systematic reviewdesigned to evaluate each contribution in its own context and onits own merits. On the contrary, I have read to discover the cracks,instabilities, and manipulated themes in order to undo the processby which the notion of ritual has been constructed and to illuminatedynamics basic to how we think about the actions of others. At therisk of making the reading more difficult than it needs to be, I havetried to quote or paraphrase terms and descriptions as much aspossible, since much of my argument rests on the subtle ways inwhich language is used.Fredric Jameson introduced a recent study by calling attentionto its \"organizational fiction,\" the textual ploy that implies theexistence of a problem the study will resolve.19 The problem ofritual is, of course, just such an organizational fiction. This bookis organized around a problem it first constructs and then solves—the problem of how the notion of ritual orders a body of theoreticaldiscourse. I must first convince you that there is a problem and that"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction  9the nature of it is such that you will find the proposed solutionsuitable. This is a strategy of scholarly production, aspects of whichare common to other forms of socially effective action. It is myhope that this book, by virtue of its arguments about ritual theoryas well as its own performance as a piece of theoretical practice(with all its schemes, feints, and blind spots), will contribute to adiscussion of the activities of understanding."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"NotesEpigraphsi.

As a tool,it must be kept from slipping out of the analyst's hand and intothe objective data he or she is trying to interpret. Yet it has be-come increasingly obvious that a tighter hold on the term doesnot seem to prevent such \"slippage\" or maintain the clarity ofthe boundary between theory and data.z To understand this in-terpretive slippage as well as the variety of positions taken withregard to ritual, it is necessary to inquire into the larger dis-courses of which ritual is a part.In the last quarter of a century scholars have discovered thattheoretical categories are more than mere tools that can be wieldedwith control or carelessness. Thomas Kuhn's reappraisal of para-digms in scientific inquiry, for example, began to disclose howanalytical categories serve more embracing models of the universeand of knowing.3 More recently, Michel Foucault's historical ar-cheology of discontinuous discourses suggests that analytical toolsdo not simply slip from a state of objectivity to which they can bereturned, but that the nature of objectivity itself rests on historicalparadigms and strategies of human inquiry effective within a specific13"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"14  The Practice of Ritual Theorymilieu. Subsequent attempts to relegitimate knowledge have madeeven more apparent the dynamics involved in the production ofparticular bodies of knowledge based on particular relationshipsbetween subject and object.4 Thus, it is no longer so easy to arguethat we can establish adequate categories merely by defining themas objective analytical tools. They will not stay neutral. Rather, theywill conform to whatever subtle purposes the larger analysis serves.We have learned that such categories are merely the most visibleof those pieces put into play within discourses whose boundaries,objectives, and rules retreat from our conscious grasp. To challengethe adequacy of our categories today, scholars must attempt totrack the dynamics of the discourse in which they operate and thediscursive logic by which they function.5The notion of ritual first emerged as a formal term of analysis inthe nineteenth century to identify what was believed to be a uni-versal category of human experience. The term expressed, therefore,the beginnings of a major shift in the way European culture com-pared itself to other cultures and religions. Since then many otherdefinitions of ritual have been developed linked to a wide varietyof scholarly endeavors. Many myth-and-ritual theorists, for ex-ample, looked to ritual in order to describe 'religion'. Later socialfunctionalists, in contrast, explored ritual actions and values inorder to analyze 'society' and the nature of social phenomena. Morerecently symbolic anthropologists have found ritual to be funda-mental to the dynamics of 'culture'. From W. Robertson Smith toClifford Geertz, the notion of ritual has been meaningful preciselybecause it functioned as much more than a simple analytical tool.Rather, it has been integral to the mutual construction of both anobject for and method of analysis.In debates about the relationship of myths (or beliefs) and rites,ritual was used to elucidate the social existence and influence ofreligious ideas. The theories of Max Miiller, Edward Tylor, HerbertSpencer, James Frazer, Rudolf Otto, William James, and E. O.James, among others, all stressed the primacy of religious ideas,born of pseudoscientific explanations or emotional experiences, asthe basis of religion. Ritual, as exemplary religious behavior, wasthe necessary but secondary expression of these mental orienta-tions.6 This understanding of ritual accompanied a primary focus"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Practice of Ritual Theory  15on religion, as having to do with the sacred, which is still seen inthe work of phenomenologists of religion today.7Fustel de Coulanges and Robertson Smith explored other nuancesof ritual as a category of human experience, coming to see it asmore basic than beliefs and integral to the social dimensions ofreligion.8 This perspective received it fullest formulation in EmileDurkheim's The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, wherereligion is analyzed as both beliefs and rites: rites could be definedonly with regard to their object, whereas in beliefs \"the specialnature of this object\" was expressed.9 Although Durkheim gave ananalytic primacy to beliefs, ritual, in the guise of \"cultus,\" playeda dynamic and necessary role in social integration and consolida-tion. Henri Hubert and Marcel Mauss, who demonstrated howritual activities effectively sacralize things, people, or events, in-verted earlier perspectives by tracing how religious phenomena andideas derived from social activities.10 In the process, ritual wasreinforced as both a central sociological concept and a universalcategory of social life.In the development of the legacy of Mauss and the other Annalestheoreticians, ritual's effect on social cohesion and equilibrium cameto be interpreted in terms of other, seemingly more basic functionssuch as symbolization and social communication. This perspectivecoincides with the emergence of culture as a category of analysis.The analysis of culture, as opposed to society and religion per se,gave a particularly critical place to ritual. The prominence of ritualin the work of cultural anthropologists such as Victor Turner, Clif-ford Geertz, Edmund Leach, and Marshall Sahlins fueled the emer-gence of a focus on ritual itself in the cross-disciplinary endeavorof ritual studies.The prominence of ritual in cultural theories has also occa-sioned some speculation. George Marcus and Michael Fishernote that description and analysis of ritual have been a populardevice for organizing ethnographic texts. This is due, they rea-son, to ritual's public nature, whereby rituals are \"analogous toculturally produced texts\" that can be systematically read to en-dow \"meaning upon experience.\"11 This understanding appearsto have promoted the study of ritual in a variety of areas in re-cent years, particularly in historical studies, communication the-"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"16  The Practice of Ritual Theoryory, theater studies, and social psychology—disciplines whosepractitioners see them, or are beginning to see them, as primarily'interpretive' endeavors. A recent consensus has emerged that rit-ual, aside from its role in illuminating religion, society, or cul-ture, should be studied in itself and for itself.\" The developmentof ritual studies as an independent and interdisciplinary area ofscholarly research evinces, perhaps, the final result of the com-plex coexistence of ritual as an analytical tool and as a universalhuman experience—its universality is taken to ensure its useful-ness and primacy as analytical concept.13Although these theories have formulated the interrelationshipsof religion, society, and culture in a variety of ways, in each caseritual is seen as a definitive component of the various processesthat are deemed to constitute religion, or society, or culture.Moreover, despite the variety of avowed methodological per-spectives and ramifications, there is a surprising degree of con-sistency in the descriptions of ritual: ritual is a type of criticaljuncture wherein some pair of opposing social or cultural forcescomes together. Examples include the ritual integration of beliefand behavior, tradition and change, order and chaos, the indi-vidual and the group, subjectivity and objectivity, nature andculture, the real and the imaginative ideal. Whether it is definedin terms of features of 'enthusiasm' (fostering groupism) or 'for-malism' (fostering the repetition of the traditional), ritual is con-sistently depicted as a mechanistically discrete and paradigmaticmeans of sociocultural integration, appropriation, or transfor-mation. Given the variety of theoretical objectives and methods,such consistency is surprising and interesting.The following chapters analyze this consistency in the theoreticaldepiction of ritual. I will show theoretical discourse on ritual to behighly structured by the differentiation and subsequent reintegra-tion of two particular categories of human experience: thought andaction. An exploration of the internal logic of this differentiationand reintegration of thought and action in ritual theory suggeststhat the recent role of ritual as a category in the study of culturehas been inextricably linked to the construction of a specifically'cultural' methodology, a theoretical approach that defines and ad-dresses 'cultural' data.

In some cases addedqualifications may soften the distinction, but rarely do such de-scriptions question this immediate differentiation or the usefulnessof distinguishing what is thought from what is done. Likewise,beliefs, creeds, symbols, and myths emerge as forms of mental con-tent or conceptual blueprints: they direct, inspire, or promote ac-tivity, but they themselves are not activities.14 Ritual, like action,will act out, express, or perform these conceptual orientations.Sometimes the push for typological clarity will drive such differ-entiations to the extreme. Ritual is then described as particularlythoughtless action—routinized, habitual, obsessive, or mimetic—and therefore the purely formal, secondary, and mere physicalexpression of logically prior ideas. Just as the differentiation ofritual and belief in terms of thought and action is usually taken forgranted, so too is the priority this differentiation accords to thought.For example, Edward Shils argues that ritual and belief are inter-twined and yet separable, since it is conceivable that one mightaccept beliefs but not the ritual activities associated with them. Heconcludes that logically, therefore, \"beliefs could exist without rit-uals; rituals, however, could not exist without beliefs.\"15 ClaudeLevi-Strauss takes this logic much further when an initial distinctionbetween ritual and myth eventuates in a distinction between livingand thinking.16Aside from this basic structural pattern in which ritual is differ-19"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"2,0  The Practice of Ritual Theoryentiated from mental categories as readily as action is differentiatedfrom thought, there is a second structural pattern in theoreticaldiscussions of ritual. This second pattern describes ritual as a typeof functional or structural mechanism to reintegrate the thought-action dichotomy, which may appear in the guise of a distinctionbetween belief and behavior or any number of other homologouspairs. Both of these structural patterns—the differentiation of ritualas action from thought and the portrayal of ritual as a mechanismfor integrating thought and action—can be demonstrated in severalrepresentative approaches to ritual.Durkheim argued that religion is composed of beliefs and rites:beliefs consist of representations of the sacred; rites are determinedmodes of action that can be characterized only in terms of therepresentations of the sacred that are their object. \"Between thesetwo classes of facts,\" he wrote, \"there is all the difference whichseparates thought from action.\"17 Yet despite the secondary natureof ritual given in these initial definitions, Durkheim's importantdiscussion of cult at the end of The Elementary Forms reintroducesritual as the means by which collective beliefs and ideals are si-multaneously generated, experienced, and affirmed as real by thecommunity. Hence, ritual is the means by which individual per-ception and behavior are socially appropriated or conditioned.18 InDurkheim's model the ritual activity of cult constitutes the necessaryinteraction between the collective representations of social life (asa type of mental or metamental category) and individual experienceand behavior (as a category of activity).19These two patterns turn up also in another, loosely structural,model employed with great sophistication by Stanley Tambiah butmore simplistically by many others. There ritual is provisionallydistinguished as the synchronic, continuous, traditional, or onto-logical in opposition to the diachronic, changing, historical, or so-cial. However, ritual is also subsequently portrayed as the arena inwhich such pairs of forces interact. It is the mediating process bywhich the synchronic comes to be reexpressed in terms of the diach-ronic and vice versa.zoA third model, presented most fully in the early work of V.Turner, also portrays these two patterns. Turner initially describedritual as the affirmation of communal unity in contrast to the fric-tions, constraints, and competitiveness of social life and organiza-"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Constructing Ritual  2.1tion.\" Rite affords a creative 'antistructure' that is distinguishedfrom the rigid maintenance of social orders, hierarchies, and tra-ditional forms. However, when subsequently portrayed as em-bodying aspects of both structure and antistructure, he describesrituals as those special, paradigmatic activities that mediate or or-chestrate the necessary and opposing demands of both communitasand the formalized social order.Each of these examples employs the two structural patterns de-scribed previously: ritual is first differentiated as a discrete objectof analysis by means of various dichotomies that are loosely anal-ogous to thought and action; then ritual is subsequently elaboratedas the very means by which these dichotomous categories, neitherof which could exist without the other, are reintegrated. These twostructural patterns are rarely explicit and the first, in particular, inwhich ritual is differentiated from conceptual categories, is routinelytaken for granted. However, the relationship that develops betweenthese two patterns when they are simultaneously operative in atheoretical description of ritual is even less acknowledged and muchmore powerful. In effect, the dichotomy that isolates ritual on theone hand and the dichotomy that is mediated by ritual on the otherbecome loosely homologized with each other. Essentially, as I willdemonstrate, the underlying dichotomy between thought and actioncontinues to push for a loose systemization of several levels ofhomologized dichotomies, including the relations between the ritualobserver and the ritual actor. It is this invisible process of 'homo-logization', driven by the implicit presence of an opposition betweenconceptual and behavioral categories, that begins to construct apersuasive and apparently logical body of discourse.Dichotomies and DialecticsJameson analyzes a type of logical structure within linguistical the-ory that is similar to the two patterns sketched out earlier for ritualtheory.\" The structured argument that he isolates provides a usefulcontrast to the one I am recovering here. Jameson points to a logicalstructure in which an initial differentiation, originally proposed toenable the theorist to concentrate on just one of the differentiatedterms, surfaces again and again within subsequent analysis of that"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"2.2,  The Practice of Ritual Theoryterm. Specifically addressing Ferdinand Saussure's system of lin-guistics, Jameson shows that an initial distinction between structureand history (synchrony and diachrony) enables Saussure to focusupon and systematically elucidate one aspect of language, the syn-chronic or structural aspect. However, Saussure never resolved ortranscended the dichotomy between synchrony and diachrony butreproduced it even in the final terms of his system/3 How did sucha replication occur?In reaction against historicism in linguistics, Jameson explains,Saussure attempted to talk about the nonhistorical aspects of lan-guage. On a primary level, he distinguished between diachrony andsynchrony, thereby providing himself a clear focus on the syn-chronic side of linguistics as opposed to the other side, where, heargued, everyone else was working. On a second level, and thereforewithin the synchronic system itself, Saussure also distinguished be-tween langue and parole in order to further differentiate synchroniclanguage from speech. He therein had his first internal replicationof the original opposition. On yet a third level, Saussure took langueas a system and within it distinguished two ways in which signsare related, the syntagmatic and the associative (or paradigmatic),replicating his original dichotomy for a second time within thesystem as a whole.Z4 The original differentiation between diachronyand synchrony was applied, through various pairs of categories, tothree levels of analysis. In other words, the continual applicationof the dichotomy between synchrony and diachrony systematicallygenerated successive and homologous levels of analysis.At this point, Jameson suggests that it becomes quite \"proble-matical to what degree the object of study is the thought patternof the linguist himself, rather than that of the language.\" Moreover,this is also the point at which the originality of Saussure's initialdistinction becomes a constraint on the whole system he has gen-erated from it. Saussure's \"initial repudiation of history,\" remarksJameson, \"which at the very outset resulted in an inability to absorbchange into the system as anything but a meaningless and contingentdatum, is now reproduced, at the very heart of the system itself, asan inability to deal with syntax as such.\"*5Theoretical discourse on ritual displays a similar logical structure:a distinction between belief and rite, made as readily as the heuristicdistinction between thought and action, clears the way to focus on"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Constructing Ritual  2.3ritual alone. This is the first structural pattern noted previously.Ritual, however, becomes in turn a new starting point at which todifferentiate once again between conceptual and behavioral com-ponents. This is the second structural pattern described earlier.However, ritual theory goes on to do something that Saussure, inthe rigor of his focus and logic, according to Jameson, failed to do,namely, provide a stage of synthetic integration. Differentiated frombelief in the first structural pattern, ritual becomes a second pointat which to distinguish thought and action. Yet at this second stageritual is seen as synthetic, as the very mechanism or medium throughwhich thought and action are integrated. The elaboration of ritualas a mechanism for the fusion of opposing categories simultaneouslyserves both to differentiate and unite a set of terms. That is, thesecond structural pattern in ritual theory, in which ritual mediatesthought and action, posits a dialectical relation between the differ-entiated entities instead of replicating an unmediated dichotomy.Ritual emerges as the means for a provisional synthesis of someform of the original opposition.Saussure generated his linguistic system by positing an initialdistinction, the successive and systematic replication of which ren-dered the distinction an ahistorical, nondialectical, or pure oppo-sition.16 Most ritual theory avoids this by incorporating the notionof dialectic or synthesis: ritual is a dialectical means for the pro-visional convergence of those opposed forces whose interaction isseen to constitute culture in some form.The three representative theories of ritual briefly described clearlypresent ritual as just such a medium of integration or synthesis foropposing sociocultural forces. These are not isolated examples.There is a strong impetus within theoretical studies of religion andculture for this type of dialectic. This impetus can be seen, forexample, in contemporary evaluations of Durkheim's theory of rit-ual. Some argue that his notion of ritual contains a dialectical me-diation of the social and the individual; others argue that itsfundamental weakness is precisely that his notion of ritual lackssuch a dialectic. E. E. Evans-Pritchard has pinpointed Durkheim'stheory of ritual as the central but \"most obscure\" and \"uncon-vincing\" part of his notion of society and religion.17 Nancy Munn,on the other hand, has found it to be of \"signal importance\" forritual studies today/8 She argues that Durkheim developed a model"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"2.4  The Practice of Ritual Theoryof \"social (ritual) symbolism as the switch point between the ex-ternal moral constraints and groupings of the socio-political order,and the internal feelings and imaginative concepts of the individualactor.\"29 Although it is precisely the nature of this switch point thatEvans-Pritchard finds obscure, Munn is clearly attempting to findrooted in Durkheim a dialectical relationship between two irre-ducible entities, the individual's subjective state and the communalorder, a dialectic mediated therefore by the collective representa-tions generated and appropriated in the cult.Sahlins has also looked for a synthetic reintegration of thoughtand action, self and society within Durkheim's theory and not foundit. He argues that Durkheim's collective representations fail to me-diate at all. Rather, as idealized representations of social values andstructures, they merely act upon subjective states to mold them. ForSahlins, Durkheim's collective representations are unable to mediateor rearticulate individual experience within social categories; allthey can do is simply appropriate and organize it into a \"metalan-guage.\"30 In a somewhat similar argument, Levi-Strauss suggestedthat Durkheim lacked an \"adequate\" notion of a symbol and sym-bolic action.31 That is, in contrast to how symbols function, Durk-heim's collective representations are mere signs, idealizations of theforms of social morphology that have become independent of theseforms, and thus act solely to subordinate and structure individualperception and experience.32Ultimately, Sahlins and Levi-Strauss find Durkheim's theory ofcult and ritual action less than complete for two reasons: first, itdoes not generate a level of cultural analysis as such; and second,it does not overcome the fundamental duality that resurfaced forDurkheim even in his portrayal of human nature itself. \"This is theobjective foundation of the idea of the soul: Those representationswhose flow constitutes our interior life are of two different specieswhich are irreducible one into another. Some concern themselveswith the external and material world; others, with an ideal worldto which we attribute a moral superiority over the first.\" For Durk-heim, therefore, \"we are really made up of two beings facing indifferent and almost contrary directions, one of whom exercises areal pre-eminence over the other. Such is the profound meaning ofthe antithesis which all men have more or less clearly conceived"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Constructing Ritual  2.5between the body and the soul, the material and the spiritual beingswho coexist within us.\"33Whether Durkheim provides a complete notion of ritual or not,we can see in his work and in the arguments of those reading hima tendency to isolate two types of sociocultural processes or entitiesand then to seek in ritual theory a model of their necessary rein-tegration. Indeed, given any initial avowal or assumption of suchdifferentiated processes, a theoretician would have to come up withsome phenomenon structured to mediate them if it did not alreadyexist. Hence, I am suggesting that descriptions of how rituals workhave been constructed according to a logic rooted in the dynamicsof theoretical speculation and the unconscious manipulation of thethought—action dichotomy is intrinsic to this construction.Saussure could not see how his initial distinctions radically limitedthe descriptive power of his system. Likewise, we do not see howsuch dichotomies as continuity and change, individual experienceand social forms, and beliefs and behavior invoke an assumptionabout thought and action that runs particularly deep in the intel-lectual traditions of Western culture. We do not see that we arewielding a particularly powerful analytical tool, nor do we see howour unconscious manipulation of it is driven not only by the needto resolve the dichotomy it establishes, but also simultaneously toaffirm and resolve the more fundamental opposition it poses—theopposition between the theoretician and the object of theoreticaldiscourse. In other words, we do not see how such dichotomiescontribute to the relational definition of a knower, a known, anda particular type of knowledge.Geertz and the Window of RitualTo clarify the relationship between dichotomies and dialecticswithin the structure of ritual theory, a fuller example is needed todemonstrate how a coherent discourse on ritual is generated. Thework of Geertz provides an excellent extended illustration for thispurpose. Geertz has been a major influence in the study of religionand ritual, as well as a navigator for many through the shoals andreefs of various methodological issues. This is due in part to the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"^6  The Practice of Ritual Theorysymmetry of his terminology, its appeal to common sense, and hisrichly anecdotal ethnographies in which texture and nuance appearto defy ethnographic reductionism.Geertz maintains that the thrust of his theoretical approach isthe explanation of \"meaning\" in cultural phenomena.34 With thisfocus he wishes to go beyond the functional or mechanistic analysesof human activity that he correlates with the reductionism of sub-ordinating either the social to the cultural or vice versa.35 Basic tothis project is a distinction between \"ethos\" and \"worldview.\"Ethos designates the moral and aesthetic aspects of a culture—apeople's \"underlying attitude toward themselves and their world.\"36Elsewhere Geertz describes ethos in terms of \"dispositions,\" definednot as activity but as the likelihood of activity taking place undercertain circumstances. Such dispositions are, in turn, further dif-ferentiated into two kinds: moods and motivations.37 Worldview,on the other hand, indicates for Geertz the \"cognitive, existentialaspects\" of a culture, a people's sense of the really real, their mostcomprehensive idea of a general order of existence.38 Understoodin this way, these two terms clearly lend themselves to a polarizationin which ethos is to worldview as action is to thought.At times Geertz explicitly correlates religious ritual with ethosand religious belief with worldview, thus invoking the first struc-tural pattern in which ritual is taken for activity in contrast to beliefas thought.39 At other times he presents ethos and worldview assynthesized, fused, or stored in symbols that are arranged in varioussystems, patterns, or control mechanisms such as ritual, art, religion,language, and myth.40 However, these systems do not only store asynthesis of ethos and worldview; they are also seen to effect it.Geertz argues with regard to ritual that \"any religious ritual nomatter how apparently automatic or conventional... involves thissymbolic fusion of ethos and world view.\"41 Here the second struc-tural pattern appears in which ritual involves the integration ofthought and action categories.The dialectical nature of this fusion of ethos and worldview ismade clear in Geertz's related discussion of symbolic systems, suchas religion, which involve both \"models for\" and \"models of\" real-ity. These systems are \"culture patterns.\" That is, they \"give mean-ing ... [or] objective form, to social and psychological reality bothby shaping themselves to it and by shaping it to themselves.\"41 With"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Constructing Ritual  2,7regard to ritual per se, Geertz suggests that \"it is in some sort ofceremonial form—even if that form be hardly more than the re-citation of a myth, the consultation of an oracle, or the decorationof a grave—that the moods and motivations which sacred symbolsinduce in men and the general conceptions of the order of existencewhich they formulate for men meet and reinforce one another.\" Hegoes on: \"In ritual, the world as lived and the world as imagined,fused under the agency of a single set of symbolic forms, turns outto be the same world.\"43Here the simplest ritual activities are seen to \"fuse\" a people'sconceptions of order and their dispositions (moods and motiva-tions) for action. For Geertz, this opposition of conceptions anddispositions, or the world as imagined and the world as lived, con-stitutes cultural life per se. Moreover, our perception and analysisof their opposition and resolution constitute a theoretical expla-nation of 'meaning' in culture. Indeed, failure to grasp the inter-action of these two fundamentally differentiated categories—conceptions and dispositions—is tantamount to the reductionismthat Geertz specifically decries, the reductionism of the social to thecultural or the cultural to the social.44 Thus, the dichotomous natureof conceptions of order (worldview) and dispositions for action(ethos) is fundamental to Geertz's approach, as is their resolutionin such symbolic systems as ritual. The temporary resolution of adichotomy is cast as the central dynamic of cultural life.So far this analysis of Geertz has simply invoked the two struc-tural patterns discussed earlier. However, Geertz also reveals a thirdpattern and the further implications of his model of ritual. He goeson to explain that cultural performances such as religious ritual are\"not only the point at which the dispositional and conceptual as-pects of religious life converge for the believer, but also the pointat which the interaction between them can be most readily examinedby the detached observer\"*5What does he mean by this? Since ritual enacts, performs, orobjectifies religious beliefs (action gives expression to thought) andin so doing actually fuses the conceptual and the dispositional as-pects of religious symbols (ritual integrates thought and action),Geertz must be concluding that ritual offers a special vantage pointfor the theorist to observe these processes. Why and how, we mightask, does ritual work to facilitate the theorist's project? The answer"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"2,8  The Practice of Ritual Theoryis left implicitly in Geertz's text. To answer explicitly, we need toretrace the homologizations that silently push his argumentforward.Outsiders, states Geertz, will see in ritual only the mere presen-tation of a particular religious perspective which they may appre-ciate aesthetically or analyze scientifically.46 Neither response, heimplies, penetrates to the real meaning and dynamics of such acultural phenomenon. For participants, on the other hand, rites are\"enactments, materializations, realizations\" of a particular religiousperspective, \"not only models of what they believe, but also modelsfor the believing of it.\"47 Thus, the outsider has only conceptualcategories with which he or she approaches the ritual activity. Par-ticipants, in contrast, actually experience in the rite the integrationof their own conceptual framework and dispositional imperatives.In this argument, Geertz is setting up a third structural pattern anda third permutation of the thought-action dichotomy. That is, ritualparticipants act, whereas those observing them think. In ritual ac-tivity, conceptions and dispositions are fused for the participants,which yields meaning. Meaning for the outside theorist comes dif-ferently: insofar as he or she can perceive in ritual the true basis ofits meaningfulness for the ritual actors—that is, its fusion of con-ceptual and dispositional categories—then the theorist can go be-yond mere thoughts about activity to grasp the meaningfulness ofthe ritual. By recognizing the ritual mechanism of meaningfulnessfor participants, the theorist in turn can grasp its meaningfulnessas a cultural phenomenon. Ritual activity can then become mean-ingful to the theorist. Thus, a cultural focus on ritual activity rendersthe rite a veritable window on the most important processes ofcultural life.48Slipping in by virtue of its homologization with the other twostructural patterns, the third one organizes the argument in such away that the theoretical explanation of 'meaning' is itself a fusionof thought and action—the theorist's thought (conceptual cate-gories) and the activity of the ritual participants (which is also afusion of conceptions and dispositions in its own right). Herein liesthe implicit structural homology: the fusion of thought and actiondescribed within ritual is homologized to a fusion of the theoreticalproject and its object, ritual activity. Both generate meaning—thefirst for the ritual actor and the second for the theorist."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Constructing Ritual  2.9Another example of an argument for a particular relationshipbetween the project of the outside observer and the project of theritual is laid out by Theodore Jennings.49 Jennings describes ritualas, first of all, a display to an observer (god, theorist, etc.) or ob-servers (the community itself) and, second, as an epistemologicalproject. Both of these dimensions of ritual act as a \"point of contact\"between the rite and the attempt by outside observers to grasp a\"theoretical-critical understanding of it.\"50 We need not castigateour pursuit of the meaning of ritual as \"voyeurism or whoring,\"Jennings asserts, since our cognitive concerns are simply an \"ex-tension\" of those of the ritual we are \"invited\" to watch.51All the delicate assumptions of Jennings's approach find theirinevitable contrast in Stephen Greenblatt's account of the episte-mological project of the amateur ethnographer Captain John G.Bourke. Bourke \"witnessed among the Zuni Indians extreme andsimultaneous violations of the codes governing food and waste, andhence experienced extreme disgust.\" His reaction, Greenblatt spec-ulates, was \"not simply an occupational hazard; after all, it is theethnographer's nausea that gives him his particular discursive field.\"The parameters of Bourke's lengthy 1891 opus, Scatologic Rites ofAll Nations, were defined, asserts Greenblatt, \"precisely by therising of his gorge.\" \"It would be absurd,\" he continues, \"to con-clude that a similar, if better disguised, revulsion lies at the con-stitutive moment of all ethnography, but one may easily find otherand more respectable instances than the work of Captain Bourke,in which aversion serves to transform behavior and material sub-stances into the objects of representation and interpretation.\"5iGreenblatt suggests that Bourke instinctively depended on hisrevulsion to define his epistemological project and the 'otherness'it both required and established. Geertz and Jennings, in contrast,would have us depend on the essential congruity or likeness of doingritual and generating theoretical interpretations of ritual to establishboth our difference from and access to the \"other.\""},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"2Constructing MeaningThe result, for Geertz, of the convergence of concepts and dispo-sitions effected by ritual is the theorist's understanding of the cul-tural meaning of a ritual. What is this meaning exactly? What doesit render meaningful and meaningless? Citing Milton Singer, Geertzsuggests how the convergence effected in ritual enables one to un-derstand the way in which people regard their religion as \"encap-sulated\" in specific performances that can be performed for visitorsand themselves.53 He quotes with much approval a well-knownpassage by Singer: \"Whenever Madrasi Brahmins (and non-Brahmins, too, for that matter) wished to exhibit to me some fea-tures of Hinduism, they always referred to, or invited me to see, aparticular rite or ceremony in the life cycle, in a temple festival, orin the general sphere of religious and cultural performances. Re-flecting on this in the course of my interviews and observations Ifound that the more abstract generalizations about Hinduism (myown as well as those I heard) could generally be checked, directlyor indirectly, against these observable performances.\"54Singer's comments are presented as the discovery of an insight-ful method. They are also, however, an excellent example of thenaturalness of the thought—action dichotomy in ritual discourse.First, in regard to Hinduism, he says that the Hindus have riteswhich they can enact or exhibit, whereas the researcher has con-cepts which can be thought or talked about. As a consequenceof this distinction, the particularity of any one local ritual is con-trasted with the more embracing, abstract generalizations of theresearcher. Second, such rites are seen not only as very particular30"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Constructing Meaning  31enactments of that abstract totality, Hinduism, but they are alsoportrayed as enactments exhibited to others for evaluation or ap-propriation in terms of their more purely theoretical knowledge.Third, because enactment of the rite is already implicitly con-strued as effecting an integration for participants between a sup-posed conceptual totality (Hinduism) and the practical needs ofa particular time and place (the dispositions within the ritualcontext), the researcher easily sees in the exhibition of these ritesfor theoretical interpretation an equally effective convergence oftheory and practice on another level—our conceptual abstrac-tions integrated with their specific practices.Thus, a model of ritual based upon our two structural patterns—in which ritual is both activity and the fusion of thought and ac-tivity—ultimately involves a third pattern, one in which the di-chotomy underlying a thinking theorist and an acting actor issimultaneously affirmed and resolved. It is this homologization thatmakes ritual appear to provide such a privileged vantage point onculture and the meaningfulness of cultural phenomena.To question Geertz's or Singer's appreciation of the way thatritual obliges the detached observer is to discover that ritual doesso by virtue of those very features with which it has been theoret-ically constituted in the first place. Again we are faced with thequestion raised by Jameson: To what extent is the object of studythe thought pattern of the theorist rather than the supposed object,ritual?We have seen in Geertz's work not only the two patterns of thethought-action dichotomy described here but a third one as well.First, ritual was said to dramatize, enact, materialize, or perform asystem of symbols. This formulation invokes the notion that activityis a secondary, physical manifestation or expression of thought.Second, by enacting the symbolic system, ritual was said to integratetwo irreducible aspects of symbols, the conceptual (worldview) andthe dispositional (ethos). In this way a thought-action dichotomyis inscribed within the opposing sociocultural forces that Geertzisolates in order to be subsequently resolved in the performance ofthe rite. On a third level, or in a third structural pattern, ritual asperformance likewise enables the integration of the theorist's ab-stract conceptual categories and the cultural particularity of therite. With this third level or pattern, the thought-action dichotomy"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"32.  The Practice of Ritual Theoryhas differentiated native ritual as activity from the thought of thetheorist, while casting the resolution of this thought-action op-position in a theoretical grasp of the meaning of the ritual acts.What constitutes meaning for the ritual actors is seen as the inte-gration of their conceptual and dispositional orientations that takesplace in ritual. What constitutes meaning for the theorist is the samemodel, the integration of his or her conceptual categories with theritual dispositions of the native actors, an integration afforded byproper analysis of ritual.To restate the structure of this argument more formally is tomake ludicrously explicit a type of logic that is effective onlywhen left unexamined. Most simply, we might say, ritual is tothe symbols it dramatizes as action is to thought; on a secondlevel, ritual integrates thought and action; and on a third level, afocus on ritual performances integrates our thought and their ac-tion. The opposition of the theorist and the ritual object be-comes homologized with two other oppositions, namely, theopposition that differentiates ritual (beliefs versus activities) andthe opposition of two fundamental sociocultural forces that is re-solved by ritual (conceptual versus dispositional forces). This ho-mology is achieved by a hidden appeal to a type of commondenominator, the opposition of thought and action. In the end, amodel of ritual that integrates opposing sociocultural forces be-comes homologized to a mode of theoretical discourse that rein-tegrates the dichotomy underlying the identification of a thinkingtheorist and an acting object.This type of expedient logic carries another inevitable corollary,however. That is, theories of ritual which attempt to integratethought and action in any guise simultaneously function to maintaintheir differentiation. This type of discourse on ritual not only con-structs a model that integrates a thinking observer and an actingobject; it simultaneously functions to distinguish them clearly. Theresolution of a dichotomy functions to affirm the polarity of theterms involved. The implications, therefore, of differentiating a sub-ject and object on the basis of thought and action are rather strikingand present some interesting ramifications to be examined later inthe next chapter. At this point, a final example further illustratesthe circular logic built up by these homologies and the theory ofritual that emerges."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Constructing Meaning  33When Ritual FailsIn his study of a Javanese funeral ceremony, Geertz ventured toanalyze \"a ritual which failed to function properly.\"55 The analysisis simple and compelling. He begins by discussing the inability offunctionalism to deal with social change and transformational socialprocesses.56 The reason for this, he suggests, is the tendency offunctional theory to identify social conflict as disintegration and totreat sociological and cultural processes unequally, reducing eitherone to the other.57 Such reductionism makes it impossible to artic-ulate social change, which arises in \"the failure of cultural patternsto be perfectly congruent with the forms of social organizations.\"58Thus, to develop theoretical tools capable of analyzing socialchange, Geertz wishes to distinguish clearly between culture andthe social system. He defines culture \"as an ordered system of mean-ing and of symbols, in terms of which social interaction takes place.\"The social system, on the other hand, is \"the pattern of socialinteraction itself.\"59 The conceptual-dispositional nature of this dis-tinction is made apparent when he further describes them as a\"framework of beliefs\" in contrast to ongoing processes of \"inter-active behavior.\" Culture is the set of meaningful terms people usefor interpretation and guidance; social system is the actual \"formthat action takes.\"60With these categories and a great deal of contextual detail, Geertzanalyses the particular failure of funeral services held after the sud-den death of a young boy. He considers the funeral rites to havefailed for the following reasons: first, they heightened tension anddistress in the community rather than producing the usual effectsof iklas, a detached acceptance of death, and rukun, communalharmony; second, the usual Islamic procedures were not followeddue to a local officiant's sense of conflict between these practicesand the politics of a new group to which the household of the boybelonged; and third, the modifications desperately introduced inorder to proceed with a funeral of some sort were ad hoc, unau-thorized, and initiated by individual enterprise rather than byconsensus.61Geertz concludes that the conflict which surfaced at the funeralwas the result of a growing discontinuity between the community'scultural framework of beliefs and the actual patterns of social in-"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"34  The Practice of Ritual Theoryteraction. That is, community members were urbanites who stillthought like villagers, expecting village values to fit increasinglyurban forms of organization behind which quite different valueswere actually operative.61 Geertz argues that a conflict between thecommunity's cultural categories (beliefs and values) and their cus-tomary social behavior (group affiliation) emerged in the funeral.This example illustrates the expedient homologizing and col-lapsing of levels of analysis that can make an interpretation appearso effective.63 Geertz's initial discussion contrasts the functionalismof sociological and social-psychological approaches with an ap-proach that can articulate the dynamics of change in positive terms.Within the space of just a few paragraphs, however, these con-trasting analytical perspectives have been rendered loosely equiv-alent to a distinction between sociological and cultural processesthat Geertz argues should be considered independently and treatedequally. These processes are then described as the forces that aremobilized and brought to confrontation in ritual. Since a ritual thatdoes not work is identified as one in which cultural and sociologicalcategories are experienced as discontinuous, we are led to assumethat successful rituals are those in which these terms or forces are\"perfectly congruent.\"Geertz has done two things in this analysis. First, the two meth-odological perspectives (the sociological and the cultural) have beenhomologized with a pair of analytical categories (culture and thesocial system, as defined by Geertz), which were then found to bethose very sundered forces underlying the dynamics of the unsuc-cessful ritual. This is a collapse of three levels and an implicit iden-tification of three sets of oppositions. Ultimately, the discontinuityaffirmed in the conclusion is a direct replication of the differentia-tion established in the beginning.Second, there are some implications for ritual. Geertz's usualmodel of ritual is upheld in this analysis by the implication that asuccessful ritual is one in which the differentiated forces of cultureand the social system can be effectively integrated. In addition,however, if an unsuccessful ritual effects change, then a successfulone maintains stasis or no change. Thus, in Geertz's analysis, ritualas an integrative mechanism is also a synchronic force within thesociety, rendering it roughly equivalent to what he considers 'cul-ture.' Although it is fairly clear that Geertz wants to conclude that"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Constructing Meaning  3 5ritual facilitates change, he is logically kept from such a conclusionby the description of this rite as a failure and by the pure oppositionsthat such an unsuccessful ritual leaves unresolved.The Myth of the Fundamental ContradictionThere are several other ways in which ritual has been cast as amechanism for the resolution of basic oppositions or contradictions.The most common approach, I have argued, is exemplified in thework of Geertz. A slightly different form can be seen in the workof Max Gluckman and some of V. Turner's analyses. In this ap-proach ritual is the arena in which purely social conflicts are workedout. In general, they describe how social conflict is recognized withinthe strategic limits of ritual where it can be systematically subsumedwithin a reaffirmation of unity.Gregory Bateson and Levi-Strauss both employ yet another per-mutation of the approach. For them, the conflict is not as generalas that between ethos and worldview, nor is it as simple and concreteas a social conflict between two parties. The problem is identifiedas one embedded in the social structure, while the ritual solutionis a more or less symbolic one that does not effect any real changes.For Bateson, an outstanding feature of the latmul naven ceremonywas the cross-dressing of particular relatives and the specific sexualgesture of the mother's brother. Analyzing these acts and featuresled Bateson to conclude that the ritual strengthens the tense andambiguous relationship between a child and his or her mother'sfamily.64 For his part, Levi-Strauss saw in the asymmetrical facialpaintings of the Caduveo Indians the attempt to resolve a \"lived\"contradiction, namely, the dilemma of marriage in a rigidly hier-archical society lacking any institutional structure for unrestrictedand egalitarian exchange.65 He suggested that the facial paintingswere the \"symbolic\" expression of an attempt at a compromisesince the Caduveo were never really able to articulate and resolveeffectively the contradiction in which they were caught.66 Levi-Strauss argued that ritual ultimately seeks the resolution of theinherent conflict of culture and nature.As with Geertz's approach, these theories see ritual as designedto address fundamental conflicts and contradictions in the society,"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"36  The Practice of Ritual Theoryand there is similarly little evidence that the conflicts so addressedare not simply imposed through the categories of the observer. Aswe have seen, it is quite common for scholars to see ritual as re-solving the conflict between thought and action, particularly in theguise of belief systems in conflict with the real world.'Contradiction' is, of course, a standard Hegelian and Marxistterm that figures prominently in analyses of social process/7 ForMarx, contradiction occurs when the forces of material productionbegin to outstrip the system of social relations to which they earliergave rise.68 Other Marxist analyses suggest that the perception ofsuch contradictions can be repressed by the generation of ideologicalstructures. Thus, cultural artifacts such as Caduveo face paintingsor works of literature are seen as expressions of this repressed butlived contradiction, expressions that embody the contradictionwhile attempting to resolve some version of it. For Marxists andmany cultural anthropologists, therefore, a basic contradiction atthe root of social experience provides the impulse for the generationof a variety of integral social phenomena—historical change andrevolution, or culture itself with its arts and institutions.69 Whetherthe emphasis is on how such fundamental contradictions are re-pressed or expressed, displaced or resolved, they are usually linkedto \"fissures\" of a type that provide the theorist with an interpretiveentre into the ideological structures of a society, an activity, or acultural artifact.Levi-Strauss and Bourdieu talk of \"fundamental oppositions\"that generate various oppositional series, which can all be reducedin turn to the most fundamental opposition. In some passages thesefundamental oppositions do not seem to mean much in themselvesbut are effective for the internal organization of taxonomic schemesthat generate the sense of a coherent cultural unity.70 That is, suchoppositions are not basic or fundamental in the sense of beingunderlying or absolute social, metaphysical, or logical values;rather, they are particularly useful tools for invoking and manip-ulating the taxonomic schemes of a culture. Bourdieu also describesritual's role in effecting change in terms of how it breaks up the'natural' taxonomic order so as to impose the reordering of 'culture.'Ritual, he states, always aims to facilitate and authorize passagesor encounters between opposed orders, presumably the orders of"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Constructing Meaning  37nature and culture or, equally reified, the old order and the neworder.71In this general type of argument the notion of a fundamentalsocial contradiction appears highly suspicious—at least by virtueof the way in which the imposition of a neat logical structure rendersritual action amenable to theoretical analysis. Certainly, the iden-tification of a contradiction out there at the root of culture andsociety also works to construct an object and method of analysisby which theory can be seen to grasp and explain the puzzles that'the other' simply lives. Roy Wagner states that \"anthropology istheorized and taught so as to rationalize contradiction, paradoxand dialectic.\"71 Indeed, contradiction in some form is readily pre-sumed in order to mandate the rational exercises, resolutions, andbreakthroughs of theory. The notion that ritual resolves a funda-mental social contradiction can be seen as a type of myth legiti-mating the whole apparatus of ritual studies.Equally mythical, perhaps, is the notion that there is anythingfundamental. As a counterpart in logic to the search for origins inhistorical studies, the notion of a fundamental force or conflict alsofunctions suspiciously like some key to understanding. In an ex-asperated tone, Foucault has declared that \"nothing is fundamen-tal\" and that, he continues, is what is really interesting about socialphenomena: \"There are only reciprocal relations, and the perpetualgaps between intentions in relation to one another.\"73In the interests of identifying such seductive myths and exploringtruly alternative conceptions of ritual activity, it is probably moreuseful to proceed with the notion that ritual is not some basicmechanism for resolving or disguising conflicts fundamental to so-ciocultural life. However, as I will explore in Parts II and III, thestrategies of ritual may well generate the sense of a basic and com-pelling conflict or opposition in light of which other contrasts areorchestrated.\"Performance\" and Other AnalogiesIn recent years the notion of 'cultural performance' has becomeincreasingly popular as a category and general approach. This pop-"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"3 8  The Practice of Ritual Theoryularity appears to have been nourished by a variety of sources.Foremost among these are Kenneth Burke's notion of \"dramatism,\"V. Turner's work on social dramas, the multiplication of categoriessuch as \"civil ceremonial\" and \"secular rites,\" work on the soci-ology of role playing along with Erving Goffman's interaction rit-uals and, last but not least, perhaps, J. L. Austin's and John Searle'sanalyses of \"speech acts.\"74In its own way, performance theory signals a strong dissatisfac-tion with the traditional categories brought to the study of ritual.At the same time, however, its focus on ritual, theater, or sports as'genres' or 'universals' of performance appears to involve the con-struction of very traditional types of relationships and categories.75Some performance theorists have explicitly aspired \"to transcendsuch conventional dichotomies as oral and written, public and pri-vate, doing and thinking, primitive and modern, sacred and secu-lar.\"76 Clearly these dichotomies have contributed to the perceptionthat theoretical analysis is failing to convey something importantabout how ritual activities are generated and experienced. Grimeshas rued how \"foreign\" ritual has become for us, while V. Turnerechoed D. H. Lawrence's quip that \"analysis presupposes acorpse.\"77 Turner, in particular, repeatedly argued that a \"livingquality frequently fails to emerge from our pedagogics.\"78 Morespecifically, Sherry Ortner suggests that frustration with structurallinguistics was responsible for this turning to how language com-municates via performance.79 Robert Wuthnow supports this ideaby explicitly contrasting dramaturgical and structural approachesto analyzing culture. The former, he argues, which focuses on ritualin the broadest sense, is able to incorporate the social dimensionlost to structural analysis.80 For Wuthnow, the dramaturgical ap-proach recasts the problem of meaning by affording a shift fromanalysis of the subjective or semantic meaning of symbols to analysisof the conditions under which symbolic acts are meaningful.81Despite their insights into the problems of ritual theory, neitherWuthnow nor the others cited effectively break free of a theoreticalframework in which activity is seen as dramatizing or enacting priorconceptual entities in order to reaffirm or reexperience them.Grimes, for example, argues \"the primacy of the human body\" inritual studies, but he equates this primacy with the body's \"capacity"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Constructing Meaning  39to enact social roles and body forth cultural meanings.\"81 Althoughthe notion of performance appears to many to offer some solutionto the way in which theory fails to grasp action, as a whole thecontributions of performance theory and terminology to the for-mulation of an approach that does not dichotomize doing andthinking remain somewhat obscure. Indeed, the performance ap-proach appears to suggest a further exaggeration of the structuredrelations between thinking theorist and acting object which I havealready examined.Performance theorists frequently base themselves on two inter-related points originally articulated by Singer. First, as noted pre-viously, people \"think of their culture as encapsulated withindiscrete performances, which they can exhibit to outsiders as wellas to themselves.\" Second, such performances constitute for theoutside observer \"the most concrete observable units of the culturalstructure\"—since each performance \"has a definitely limited timespan, a beginning and an end, an organized program of activity, aset of performers, an audience, and a place and occasion of per-formance.\"83 Although such statements do not constitute an agendafor systematic analysis, they are more than a simple application ofthe \"drama analogy\" with its whole system of terms, relationships,and assumptions.84 Singer did not merely suggest an approach toritual that guarantees direct access to native units of experience andclear observation of sociocultural processes; he also defined cultureitself in terms of those very activities that appear to provide suchclear access and observation. That is, cultural performances are theways in which the cultural content of a tradition \"is organized andtransmitted on particular occasions through specific media.\"85Thus, these performances are the specific and particular manifes-tations ('instances') of culture aside from which culture is just anabstract category.86 However, if culture is the giving of perfor-mances, then culture is that which is given to an 'audience' or theoutside theorist who has joined it. Researchers and theorists arerepositioned in performance theory: no longer peering in throughthe window, they are now comfortably seated as members of theaudience for whom the performance is being presented. As such,the theorist-observer has become an important participant, one whois integral both to the actors' ability to act culturally (i.e., to per-"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"40  The Practice of Ritual Theoryform) and to their ability to understand their own culture (sincesuch understanding is the result of expressing their general culturalorientations in discrete ritual activities).In some cases, performance theory appears to promote an evenmore intense mode of participation. In discussing ritual and socialdrama, for example, Turner calls for the \"performance of ethnog-raphy\" by both anthropologists and professional actors.87 JohnMacAloon refers to the \"performance\" given by academic partic-ipants at a symposium that resulted in the book he subtitled \"Re-hearsals Toward a Theory of Cultural Performance.\"88 Grimes findsthat the activities of scattered experiments in improvisational the-ater are \"crucial both to the practice and study of religion, partic-ularly ritual studies.\"89This enhanced participation of the scholar-observer takes an in-teresting form in Grimes's development of the project of \"ritualcriticism.\" Ritual criticism is loosely modeled on the relationshipof literary criticism to literature and on cultural-critical develop-ments in anthropology (as described by Marcus and Fischer). More-over, Grimes's critical evaluation of ritual can be conducted in avariety of ways: through indigenous forms of emic criticism, eticforms by scholars or foreign critics, and even criticism of one re-ligious tradition by another. In another formulation, he contraststhe criticism practiced by rites and ritualists themselves with thecritical activities of \"ritologists.\"90 The position of the critical ob-server, Grimes suggests, should be neither scientifically neutral northeologically normative; the purpose of critical observation is toaid in the recognition of ritual exploitation on the one hand orappropriate revision and borrowing of ritual practices on theother.91 It appears that two concerns are central to Grimes's project:first, an appreciation of the inadequacy of earlier models of partic-ipant-observer relations and, second, a real sense of shared purposebetween participants and critics. What Jennings saw as a shared\"epistemological\" project, Grimes would appear to embrace as ashared project of both cultural critique and reflexive self-observation.Performance terminology has been used in a wide variety of ways.By far the most cautious performance position was laid out by theBritish anthropologist Gilbert Lewis. According to Lewis, our ten-dency to be preoccupied with the intellectual aspects of responses"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Constructing Meaning  41to ritual (i.e., deciphering the meaning of its coded messages) leadsus to overlook more immediate sensory responses. He suggests \"lik-ening\" ritual to the performance of a play or a piece of music, buthe cautions against using such insights into ritual to define it.92If Lewis has been the most cautious of those who invoke per-formance, then V. Turner was certainly one of the most enthusiastic.Yet Turner's late work on ritual and performance remains funda-mentally within the framework of his early theory of ritual as thetransformational dialectic of structure and antistructure (or orga-nization and communitas) to serve as a vehicle for unfolding socialdramas.93 Social dramas are embodied in ritual, where they haveparadigmatic functions that make clear the deepest values of theculture. In Turner's view, such paradigmatic functions also serveto provide the outsider with a \"limited area of transparency in theotherwise opaque surface of regular, uneventful social life.\"94 Thisis the same \"window of ritual\" evoked by Geertz.Performance theory probably has one of its most sophisticatedpresentations in the work of Stanley Tambiah. Tambiah explicitlyreacts against the opposition of thought and action and suggeststhat the devaluation of action embedded in the distinction can beredressed by a focus on performance.95 Like Ortner and Wuthnow,he argues that the social dimension becomes more accessiblethrough performance theory. Tambiah is particularly concerned, infact, that the significance of the semantic structure of words andacts not lead us to ignore the significance of social relations bothwithin the ritual itself and within the larger context of the rite.96He breaks with the Durkheimian approach developed by Gluckmanand V. Turner in arguing that ritual does not evoke feelings orexpress the mental orientation of individuals in any sort of directand spontaneous way. Rather, he emphasizes the formalism of ritualas having a distancing effect that serves to articulate and commu-nicate attitudes of institutionalized communication.97 Tambiah'sappreciation for the social dimension also leads him to amend Aus-tin and Searle by explicating the necessary social conditions underwhich \"saying is doing\" and ritual is \"a mode of social action.\"98Saying is just saying and formalized acts are idiosyncratic, he argues,unless they conform to established social conventions and subjectthemselves to judgments of legitimacy.99Tambiah distinguishes three ways in which ritual is performative:"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"42,  The Practice of Ritual Theory(i) it involves doing things, even if the doing is saying in the Aus-tinian sense; (2.) it is staged and uses multiple media to affordparticipants an intense experience; and (3) it involves indexicalvalues in the sense laid out by Pierce. The indexical features of ritualare seen in its graded scale of ostentatiousness, the choice of site,the degree of redundancy or elaboration, and so on, all of whichpresent and validate the social hierarchy indirectly depicted by them.As a system of communication, ritual involves both indexical fea-tures that refer to the social hierarchy and symbolic features thatrefer to the cosmos. Indeed, Tambiah goes on to elaborate a seriesof opposing features mobilized in ritual, including semantic/refer-ential components versus pragmatic components, form versus con-tent, the cultural and the universal, and indexical symbolism versusindexical iconicity.100 Thus, despite his focus on performance andhis concerns about the thought-action dichotomy, he also is drawninto the familiar dilemma of setting out to transcend one bifurcationonly to generate others that find their integration in ritual as amechanism for fusing theoretical distinctions.101Performance theory rests of course on the slippery implicationsof an extended metaphor, specifically the analogy between ritualactivities and the acts of performing and dramatizing. While it offersa new descriptive vantage point on aspects of ritual activities, as aparadigm or model it is gravely disadvantaged in several ways. First,the increased naturalization of the outside observer that is obtainedin the very definition of act as performance takes the relationshipbetween subject and object constructed by the theorist and inscribesit into the nature of the object itself. In other words, ritual comesto be seen as performance in the sense of symbolic acts specificallymeant to have an impact on an audience and entreat their interpre-tive appropriation. Second, the notion of performance as a theo-retical tool for approaching certain activities comes to be used asdescriptive of the fundamental nature of those activities; in otherwords, a model of ritual activity provides the criteria for what isor is not ritual. Third, although performance may become a criterionfor what is or is not ritual, insofar as performance is broadly usedfor a vast spectrum of activities, there is no basis to differentiateamong ways of performing. An initial focus on the performativeaspects of ritual easily leads to the difficulty of being unable to"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Constructing Meaning  43distinguish how ritual is not the same as dramatic theater or spec-tator sports.IOZRappaport attempts to avoid some of these problems when hemaintains that ritual is not drama, although performance, like for-mality, is a sine qua non of ritual.103 In this way he holds on to theprimacy of doing and acting that a performance focus promises,but he does not succumb to the slippage of explaining by analogy.In a somewhat similar vein, Emily Ahern also challenges the de-scription of ritual as a dramatization that is meant to affect theparticipants as opposed to the external world.104 In so doing, shepoints to an interesting problem inherent in the performance met-aphor: Since performance theory denies any validity to indigenousclaims that certain actions affect the gods, the harvest, or anythingbeyond the dispositions of the actors and audience, how muchepistemological sharing can there actually be between Chinese par-ticipants and Western interpreters concerning the type of project atstake in a Chinese \"soul-settling\" ceremony?Performance theorists, of course, argue that what ritual does iscommunicate (and hence, it does not secure the intercession ofdeities, pacify the dead, or encourage rain, etc.) and it is throughthis function that ritual indirectly affects social realities and per-ceptions of those realities. However, when performance theory at-tempts to explain such communication it must fall back on ritualactivity as depicting, modeling, enacting, or dramatizing what areseen as prior conceptual ideas and values. The meaningfulness ofritual that such interpretations attempt to explicate has nothing todo with the efficacy that the ritual acts are thought to have by thosewho perform them. The idiom of communication through symbolicacts maybe a corrective to the notion of magic, but it does little toconvey what these acts mean to those involved in them.In his famous discussion of \"blurred genres,\" Geertz looks atthree popular analogies adopted by the social sciences to interpretsocial behavior.105 He begins with the \"game\" analogy, then goeson to explore the \"drama\" analogy, and finally turns to the \"text\"analogy. The drama analogy, he suggests, affords an appreciationof certain features of action, specifically its temporality, collectivity,public nature, and power to transmute not just opinions but peoplethemselves. However, it lumps all types of social action together as"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"44  The Practice of Ritual Theoryhaving the same form without any ability to appreciate the differ-ences in content. The game and text analogies likewise illuminatecertain features and confuse others. All of these analogies, he argues,are examples of a cases-and-interpretations approach to social the-ory, rather than the older laws-and-instances approach. Thus, theyare concerned with interpretation and meaning, specifically, what\"all the usual objects of social-scientific interest\" mean to thosewho are immediately involved in them.106 Yet it is not at all clearthat this actually is the type of meaning derived from the theoreticaldeployment of these analogies. While Geertz finds that \"religioussymbols... reek of meaning,\" Tambiah has his doubts.107 Tambiahrejects such \"intentionality\" theories as inadequate to the interpre-tation of formalized and conventionalized action and finds the var-ious conceptions of meaning in anthropology a \"deadly source ofconfusion.\"108 With the exception of Tambiah, however, the pop-ularity of performance metaphors and theories represents somethingof a consensus about \"meaning\" as a specifically hermeneuticalconception.In the same vein, Marcus and Fischer suggest that the popularityof ritual as a theoretical focus is based on how readily a publicperformance can be read like a text.109 The text analogy is usedexplicitly in Alton Becker's study of Indonesian wayang perfor-mances as \"text-building.\" It is more implicit in James Fernandez'sstudy (with its echoes of Boas and Burke) of ritual as the strategicdeployment of a metaphor.110 In both cases, however, the inter-pretative hermeneutic brought to bear on ritual approaches the riteas if it were a text. In his essay \"Deep Play,\" Geertz also explicitlyapproaches ritualized activities as a text to be decoded.111 Yet heconcludes his later comparison of blurred genres with a recognitionof the particular dangers and implausibility of the text analogy. Itsapplication to action is, Geertz argues, an example of \"a thorough-going conceptual wrench.\"112 Hinting at the problems involved inthe readiness to decode ritual, Geertz nearly echoes some of Tam-biah's reservations after all.Paul Ricoeur has argued both systematically and pointedly that\"meaningful action\" is indeed like a text, delineating criteria fortextuality that meaningful action also fulfills.113 For the most part,however, the textual analogy is usually applied with much lessclarity. Moreover, the analogy tends to be based not on the assertion"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Constructing Meaning  45of a similarity between texts and rites but on the similarity of theinterpretive position of the theorist in each case. In fact, if we thinkin terms of the mode of interpretation rather than the similaritiesof such objects as rite, drama, and text, the text analogy can beseen to underlie the drama analogy and be quite basic to perfor-mance theory.Certainly there is a general tendency in the social sciences to'textualize' the objects of its concern. Such textualization, accordingto Jameson, is \"a methodological hypothesis whereby the objectsof study of the human sciences... are considered to constitute somany texts which we decipher and interpret, as distinguished fromthe older view of those objects as realities or existants or substanceswhich we in one way or another attempt to know.\"114 We textualize,he implies, not because rites are intrinsically like texts, but becausewe approach both looking for meaning as something that can bedeciphered, decoded, or interpreted. Developing Geertz's contrastbetween \"law-and-instances\" and \"cases-and-interpretation\" stylesof analysis, one might suppose that the shift in cultural studies awayfrom the model of science and the dogma of scientific objectivityhas been essentially based on an interpretive-textual model.115Yet the interpretive project, whether conducted in literary criti-cism or anthropology, carries some important assumptions. Fore-most among them are the assumptions that the text (rite or anotherexample of meaningful social action) is autonomous and unified onthe one hand, and that its latent meaning is fully accessible to aclose reading of its manifest form on the other.116 Both assumptionspresent problems when it comes to the avowed benefits of a per-formance approach to ritual. For example, the emphasis on theactivity of ritual which performance theory attempts to developmay actually be something of an illusion. The interpretive endeavorrequires, and assumes, that activity encodes something. As the fore-going thought—action argument illustrated, the assumed existenceof such a 'something,' the latent meaning of the act, once againdevalues the action itself, making it a second-stage representationof prior values.It has been suggested that the reasons for the shift to a perfor-mance approach, with its underlying interpretive-textual paradigm,are the perceived failures of earlier models and the greater explan-ative power, particularly in terms of social dimensions, of the new"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"46  The Practice of Ritual Theoryparadigm. The performance paradigm deserves a thorough assess-ment of its \"merits as a concept,\" as Leach would say, and theresults might vindicate this explanation of its popularity. Yet it isalso possible to see some basis for its popularity in the distinctiveimagery of performance theory (that of a sensitive and appreciativeparticipant interpreter, not a coldly detached, analytic scientist) andin the greater obscurity of the slippage involved (how much morereadily 'performance' slips from being a tool for analysis to beinga feature of the object and thereby validates an approach and awhole discourse). While it is this type of slippage that affords theexpedient logic on which many theories of ritual are based, thisimagery is an equally powerful incentive for ritual studies."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"3Constructing DiscourseThe preceding chapter suggested that there is a logic of sorts tomost theoretical discourse on ritual and that this discourse is fun-damentally organized by an underlying opposition between thoughtand action. Although initially employed to afford a heuristic focuson ritual as a type of activity, this fundamental dichotomy helps togenerate a series of homologized oppositions that come to includethe relationship between the theorist and the actors. At the sametime, ritual is portrayed as mediating or integrating all these op-positions. Constituting ritual in this way involves a particular struc-turing of the subject's relationship with its object. It is not simplya matter of constituting ritual as an autonomous and general objectof study distinct from particular rites—in the way that Saussureconstituted linguistics by differentiating language from its actuali-zation or Panofsky established art as objectively distinct from pe-culiarly valued works.117 The thought—action dichotomy not onlydifferentiates ritual-as-activity as an object of theoretical attention;it also differentiates a 'thinking' subject from an 'acting' object—or, when pushed to its logical conclusion, a 'thinking' subject froma 'nonthinking' object. Then, in the same way that ritual is seen toreintegrate thought and action in some form, discourse on ritual isseen to afford special access to cultural understanding by integratingthe subject's thought and the object's activities.As demonstrated, this discursive structure can be delineated in aseries of three structural patterns. In the first, ritual as activity isdifferentiated from conceptual categories. In the second, ritual isthe cultural medium by which thoughts and acts (or concepts and47"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"48  The Practice of Ritual Theorydispositions, beliefs and behavior, etc.) are reintegrated. In the third,the activities of the object (the actors) and the concepts of the subject(the theorist) are also integrated by means of a discursive focus onthe integrative function of ritual. Of course these patterns are not'logical' in the usual sense of the term. Rather, an initial and oftenunconscious assumption—to think about ritual as a type of ac-tivity—invokes a powerful dichotomy between thought and actionthat helps in turn to generate a discourse loosely structured buteffectively, or persuasively, systematized by the expedient logic ofhomologized levels of structural patterns.118It is possible that the whole structure of theoretical discourse onritual primarily serves to solve the problems posed for scholars bytheir reliance on a distinction between thought and action. It is adistinction used not only to differentiate project and object, methodand data, or theory and facts; it also appears to be essential to anyso-called theoretical project in the first place and, in a second place,to the generation of meaning or explanation.119 Thus, an implicituse of the dichotomy may well overdetermine the real problemsthat remain.Perhaps the initial generation of polarized distinctions and theirsubsequent homologous replication is inevitable in the process ofanalysis or interpretation. Indeed, dichotomization and the systemsof practical homologies that such dichotomies can generate arethought to be integral to the fundamental processes of differentia-tion involved in perception, cognition, and human activity in gen-eral. However, a closed and highly structured discourse may benecessary only to an attempt to generate and secure bodies of knowl-edge that have a particular function with regard to the knower andthe known: they set up a relationship based on differentiating onefrom the other while inscribing the basis for this differentiation intothe nature of the object itself, that is, the reality of ritual.IZOIn the final analysis the results of such a differentiation betweenthought and action cannot be presumed to provide an adequateposition vis-a-vis human activity as such. Naturally, as many othershave argued before, the differentiation tends to distort not only thenature of so-called physical activities, but the nature of mental onesas well. Yet the more subtle and far-reaching distortion is not theobvious bifurcation of a single, complex reality into dichotomousaspects that can exist in theory only. Rather, it is the far more"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Constructing Discourse  49powerful act of subordination disguised in such differentiations, thesubordination of act to thought, or actors to thinkers. Indeed, nomatter how provisional or heuristic, a distinction between thoughtand action is not a differentiation between two equally weightedterms. When used, it is rarely intended to be. Despite the seemingequality of abstract distinctions—male-female, black-white, true-false, one—many—such dichotomies are implicitly employed to af-ford one term some purchase over the other. To perceive this is tograsp differentiation itself as an activity and, therefore, to begin toappreciate the strategic activity of theory-making in general.Let us look at this particular form of theoretical activity moreclosely. To generate theoretical discourse on culture, or almost anytheoretical discourse for that matter, it is necessary to do two things:first, to specify a distinct level or mode of analysis, in this case a'cultural' level; and second, to identify an object or phenomenonthat exists as a 'meaningful totality' only on such a level of analysis.This object will act as the natural object of the specified mode ofanalysis, although the object so identified is not independent of thisanalysis; it is constituted and depicted as such in terms of the spec-ified method of analysis. That is, the object and the method areactually intrinsic to each other, one demonstrating the naturalnessand validity of the other. As we have seen with ritual, particularlyin the extended example drawn from Geertz, the structure of theconstituted object is a veritable model of the method of analysisand vice versa.Mauss provides a particularly clear and concise example of howthis process was used to establish a specifically 'sociological' levelof analysis, the object of which was, he indicated, \"total socialphenomena.\" Mauss argued that his new method sees social systemsas wholes, that is, as where \"body, soul, society—everythingmerges.\" It is only as wholes that the \"essence\" of the social systemis revealed.IZI \"We are dealing with something more than a set ofthemes,\" he wrote, \"more than institutional elements, more thaninstitutions, more even than systems of institutions divisible intolegal, economic, religious and other parts. We are concerned with'wholes', with systems in their entirety.\" Such wholes cannot bebroken down into smaller elements since \"it is only by consideringthem as wholes that we have been able to see their essence, theiroperation and their living aspect.\"1\""},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"50  The Practice of Ritual TheoryMauss argued that a total social phenomenon such as gift-givingcan be analyzed in its totality and essence only through a specificallysociological method of analysis, that is, the study of dynamic me-tasystems that include legal, economic, religious institutions as wellas persons in their sense of themselves as individuals and as a group.It is an inherently circular argument, of course—which is preciselywhat enables it to demonstrate perfectly the simultaneous construc-tion of an object, a method, and a framework of discourse, all ofwhich reinforce each other.To establish a level of analysis that is distinctly cultural, one mustlikewise identify 'cultural facts' that exist as meaningful wholes onlyon the horizon of this cultural perspective and can be analyzed forthe essence of their wholeness only through a specifically culturalmethod of analysis. We saw that Geertz made \"meaning\" in \"cul-tural phenomena\" the object of his analysis. In his studies thismeaning was revealed through a particular method: the initial dif-ferentiation of conceptual and dispositional categories, which fa-cilitated a recognition of their fusion (or failure to fuse) in suchcultural phenomena as ritual and religion. The method is also amodel of the object upon which Geertz focused—namely, ritual asthat which fuses conceptual and dispositional categories. Further-more, the method is the means of identifying a new and specificrelationship between a knower and the object known, a relationshipthat is mediated by a specifically cultural body of knowledge.The same pattern for constructing object, method, and subject-object relationship can be seen in Hans-Georg Gadamer's or Ri-coeur's application of the model of the text to the interpretation ofsocial action.123 Ricoeur, as noted earlier, specifies four criteria forwhat constitutes a text: its fixing of meaning, its dissociation fromthe mental intention of the author, the display of nonostensivereferences, and the universal range of its addresses.124 The mostpertinent is the objectification that \"fixing\" in writing brings. Ri-coeur goes on to argue that action can be similarly fixed (and italso displays the other three criteria), implying that it is this objec-tification that renders action open to investigation and hence tomeaningfulness. The meaning of the act can be detached from theevent of the act in the same way that a text can be detached fromits author. This \"autonomization,\" he argues, is the basis of action'ssocial dimension and meaning.125 As a result, a meaningful action"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Constructing Discourse  51is an action whose importance goes beyond its relevance to its initialsituation. In other words, an action can be meaningful only whenit is detached from its initial context and objectified as an auton-omous entity, and when its autonomous significance is assessed forany relevance or importance that can be addressed to \"an indefiniterange of possible readers.\"1*6 Ricoeur rightly appreciates howmeaning is conferred or awarded when decontextualized entitiescan prove themselves relevant to the interpreter. And his appreci-ation of this is based on his understanding of the mediating role ofobjectification—as the creation of an autonomous \"object\"—inscientific methodology.To treat action as a text, Ricoeur argues, is to objectify it andtherein disjoin \"meaning\" from intentionality of the author or ac-tor.IZ7 This process engenders a first-stage dialectic between ver-stehen and erkldren, understanding and explanation, guessing andvalidating, a subjective approach and an objective approach. Asecond stage involves the reverse dialectic—from explanation tounderstanding—starting with the referential functions of the action-as-text and moving beyond the ostensive situation (surface-levelsemantics), via a structural act of distancing, to the depth semanticsthat will yield an interpretation. For Ricoeur, these depth semanticsopen up for interpretation the \"ultimate referent\" of the text action,its \"world propositions\"—which are not what the text action issaying but what it is talking about.128 (Note that Geertz also talksabout \"how the said is rescued from its saying\" by the inter-preter.)IZ9 The understanding that results is, of course, \"entirelymediated by the whole of the explanatory procedures which precedeit and accompany it.\"130 As a result, this act of hermeneutical un-derstanding does not appropriate a foreign experience; rather, it isan act that appropriates the power to disclose the world that is thetrue referent of the text.131In this very abbreviated summary, Ricoeur can be seen to lay outthe steps for creating an object amenable to a certain type of scru-tiny; insofar as the object so constructed and scrutinized is seen toyield a higher, fuller, truer meaning (indeed, its only real meaning-fulness), it simultaneously constructs and legitimates that methodof scrutiny. For Ricoeur, the social dimension of an act is its abilityto act outside its initial context and help construct meaningfulnessfor the interpreter. Ricoeur is very aware that these steps construct"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"5 2,  The Practice of Ritual Theorya particular discourse, that of hermeneutics per se, and he is self-consciously extending that discourse to address social action. In theend, meaningfulness mediates subject and its object; it constitutesthem and is simultaneously constituted by them. The goal of thewhole enterprise is clearly the discourse itself, constructed by awinding series of oppositions, homologized, mediated, and redun-dant. Ultimately, the discourse is a function of meaning and meaninga function of the discourse.Marcus and Fischer suggest that the trend in anthropology in thelast twenty years or so has been a gradual shift away from theconstruction of grand theories of culture and society to a moreinterpretive and narrowly focused mode of reflection upon field-work, writing, and hermeneutical problems.131 Quentin Skinner, ofcourse, argues the opposite with regard to the more broadly defined\"human sciences.\"133 Skinner finds that despite themselves the ma-jor \"anti-theorists\" of the last few decades have generated com-prehensive and architectonic theoretical frameworks. Differentfrom the \"laws-and-instances\" mode of theorizing, as Geertz putit, the more recent style of object-and-discourse construction canappear to its participants as antitheoretical and committed to cul-tural self-reflection. Indeed, the cultural knowledge constituted inthis type of discourse tends to see itself as both salvaging othercultures from Westernization and serving as the basis for the West'sown cultural critique.134Roy Wagner, for example, depicts the role of the anthropologistas a \"bridge\" that mediates two cultures, not merely outsider toboth but also inventor of both cultures through the activity ofstudying and interpreting.135 In Ricoeur's terms, such a figure is amaker of meaning. For both Wagner and Ricoeur, it is a crucial ifslightly melodramatic role. Rereading these types of descriptions,one cannot help but recall Susan Sontag's description of Levi-Straussand hear in it more ambivalence today, perhaps, than she intendedin 1961.He is not, like recent generations of American anthropologists, simplya modest data-collecting \"observer.\" Nor does he have any axe—Christian, rationalist, Freudian, or otherwise—to grind. Essentially heis engaged in saving his own soul, by a curious and ambitious act of"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Constructing Discourse  53intellectual catharsis The anthropologist... acts out a heroic, dil-igent and complex modern pessimism.136These sentiments are echoed elsewhere: \"Anthropology is not themindless collection of the exotic, but the use of cultural richnessfor self-reflection and self-growth.\"137 Or, \"anthropology, reifiedas the study of man, is the study of men in crisis by men in crisis.\"138\"The history of anthropology is a sustained sequitur to the contra-diction of its existence as a Western science of other cultures.\"139Although the question goes beyond the scope of this study, weshould make preliminary inquiries into the impetus for this in-terpretive form of cultural knowledge and discourse. Some possibleclues are implicit in the analysis so far. A more or less internalimpetus for generating such discourse on culture may well havebeen the attempt to come to some resolution of the major conflictingforces in the humanities and social sciences in the last three decades.Variously identified, this conflict has usually been seen as a tensionbetween how something functions and what something symbolizes,between intellectualists and symbolists, between utility and mean-ing, or explanation and understanding.140 Dell Hymes, for example,has heralded the specific possibility that the study of performancecould very well integrate the social sciences and the humanities.141Similar sentiments have been expressed by V. Turner and Grimesamong others. Yet a sense of commitment to a mode of analysis inwhich the symbolic tends to dominate the functional is common tomost of these theorists.I4Z This suggests that the search for inte-gration has been led by the symbolists. We can see in their modelof ritual something of the integration they are seeking: apparentlyequal consideration of differentiated social and cultural forces il-luminates the effective interaction and fusion of these forces withinsuch phenomena as ritual, making apparent the true meaning ofcultural phenomena.An external impetus for cultural knowledge may derive from thefact that the social sciences and humanities are now operating in aworld where \"the natives\" have increasingly freed themselves fromcolonialism and the cultural assumptions behind it, where localinformants have been educated abroad, and peoples deemed to haveno history have become quite sophisticated in their manipulation"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"54  The Practice of Ritual Theoryof the media, politics, and sentiments of technologically dominantnations.143 Within this milieu cultural knowledge may be an attemptto cut a new image or find a new basis between theorist and nativeactors upon which to continue the traditions of research we inherit.Cultural knowledge constituted through the study of ritual andperformance appears to experiment with a new sense of communitybetween theorists and actors, characterized by modest, mutual de-pendence and shared problems of meaning, epistemology, and crit-ical self-reflection. Yet the domination of the theoretical subject isneither abrogated nor transcended.144 This domination is main-tained and disguised by virtue of the implicit structuring of thethought-action dichotomy in its various forms.145Ritual, I have suggested, has a prominent role in securing thisform of cultural knowledge. Although ritual has been perceived invery different ways since the beginnings of the social sciences, ithas consistently been a fundamental focus for invoking major issues.Yet something more may well be at work when ritual is declaredto be \"the basic social act.\"1461 have tried to suggest that ritual isan eminently suitable device for organizing a theoretical conver-sation that wishes to uncover cultural meanings through the inter-pretation of \"texts\" that \"reek of meaning.\" The construction ofritual as a decipherable text allows the theorist to interpret simplyby deconstructing ritual back into its prefused components. Thetheoretical construction of ritual becomes a reflection of the theo-rist's method and the motor of a discourse in which the concernsof theorist take center stage."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"I.

Action (Handeln) isthe \"fundamental unit\" of Weber's sociology, a unit that representsthe act and its subjective meaning to the actor, which cannot beseparated from each other. Hence, for Weber action cannot be ana-lyzed \"independently of belief\" (Peacock, p. 82,). As such, Weberiananalysis focuses on the relationship between the individual and hisor her acts and involves the interpretation of the meanings of thoseacts to the actor. It does not focus on the relationship of beliefs tosociety as in the Durkheimian approach. This Weberian perspectivewas elaborated into a full theory of action by Talcott Parsons, ofcourse, in The Structure of Social Action (New York: Free Press,1937) and with Edward Shils in Toward a General Theory of Action(New York: Harper and Row, 1962)."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"58  NotesYet the objection can be made that the results of both the Durk-heimian and the Weberian approaches are rather similar. The Durk-heimian is left with a vividly constructed social self (or spiritual being)oddly contrasted with that other vaguely noted being, the physicalindividual self. In his opposition of self and society, the self is left insomewhat mystical shadows. The Weberian on the other hand is leftwith a vivid construction of the subjective meanings attached to theobjective acts of the individual in contrast to the social significanceof these acts. Their social significance, or meaningfulness for othersin the culture, cannot be depicted. Rather their transpersonal sig-nificance can be described only in terms of logical and idealizedsystems of socioeconomic behavior completely dissociated from realpeople and their activities. In both Durkheimian and Weberian con-ceptualizations, an underlying distinction between the individual andsociety, or belief and action, pushes the analysis to a dualism inwhich two entities or forces are simply juxtaposed and not reallyintegrated.Numerous Durkheimians and Weberians have attempted tocomplete the \"integration\" that their masters left incomplete.

Bybuilding on specific aspects of practice theory, however, I will layout an approach to ritual activities that stresses the primacy of thesocial act itself, how its strategies are lodged in the very doing ofthe act, and how 'ritualization' is a strategic way of acting in specificsocial situations. The framework of ritualization casts a new lighton the purpose of ritual activity, its social efficacy, and its embod-iment in complex traditions and systems. This alternative frame-work for understanding ritual behavior will be developed furtherin Part III; here I attempt to explicate some basic principles bywhich to reorient ourselves to ritual activity.67"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"4Action and PracticeMost attempts to define ritual proceed by formulating the universalqualities of an autonomous phenomenon. They maintain, howeverprovisionally, that there is something we can generally call ritualand whenever or wherever it occurs it has certain distinctive fea-tures. Such definitions inevitably come to function as a set of criteriafor judging whether some specific activities can be deemed ritual.As a result, these definitions of ritual are not complete when theyset up a single universal construct; additional categories are neededto account for all the data that do not fit neatly into the domainof the original term. Definitions of ritual must go on to suggest,explicitly or implicitly, the nature and relation of nonritual activityand various degrees of nearly-but-not-quite-ritual behavior. Hence,a good deal of writing about ritual involves extensive exercises incleaning up all the data and terms that are not included in the maindefinition. As a taxonomic enterprise, universal categories havemade undisputed contributions to the organization and extensionof both empirical observation and particular knowledge systems.Yet with regard to the study of ritual, the initial usefulness of thisapproach may have begun to give way to a bewildering number ofproblems.First of all, categorization develops a dizzying momentum of itsown. The plethora of \"ritual types,\" as Grimes points out, dem-onstrates how little certainty there is \"in identifying either ritual'scenter or boundaries.\"1 Distinctions are routinely drawn betweenritual studies and liturgies, religious ritual and secular ritual, ritualand ceremonial, secular ritual and secular ceremony, political ritual69"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"jo  The Sense of Ritualand civic ceremonial, private ritual and collective ritual, rites ofrebellion and rites of solidarity, dramatic performance and ritualperformance, the formality of games (in play and organized sports)and the formality of ritual, ritual and festival, festival and holiday,and so on.z As distinctions and categories proliferate, scholars beginto talk in rather elaborate circles. For example, Monica Wilson setup an important early model by distinguishing ritual from cere-monial. Goody subsequently recast Wilson's distinction by placingritual within a more widely embracing understanding of ceremonial.Gluckman, in turn, took Goody's revision of Wilson's categoriesand inverted it to make ceremonial a subset of ritual.3There is another serious consequence of such definitions of ritual.The categories of activity so defined tend to override and underminethe significance of indigenous distinctions among ways of acting.4At best, culturally specific distinctions may be noted in the attemptto discern the nuances of some particular expression of the universalphenomenon, but the 'universal' always impoverishes the 'partic-ular.' In this way, the definitional approach to ritual loses sight ofwhat may be the more useful questions that can be brought to bearon ritual activities of various kinds: Under what circumstances aresuch activities distinguished from other forms of activity? How andwhy are they distinguished? What do these activities do that otheractivities cannot or will not do?To take up these questions it is necessary to break free of theentrenched tendency to define ritual either as a distinct and auton-omous set of activities or as an aspect of all human activity. Yet,as Lewis notes, most influential theories of ritual belong to one ofthese two camps: some stress the distinctiveness of ritual, how it isclearly different from all other kinds of activity; others stress thecongruity of ritual with other forms of human action, usually byseeing ritual as \"the expressive, symbolical or communicative as-pect\" of action in general.5 The first group usually proceeds bycontrasting ritual/magical activity with technical/utilitarian activity.Hence, in ritual activity the relationship between ends and meansis described as rule-governed, routinized, symbolic, or noninstru-mental. By contrast, technical activity is described as pragmatic,spontaneous, and instrumentally effective.6 Sometimes ritual is seento possess both expressive and instrumental aspects simulta-neously.7 Yet even in this last formulation, the expressive aspects"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Action and Practice  71of ritual are usually considered to be more authentic to ritual perse than its pragmatic aspects, which may even be characterized asmagical.In descriptions of the noninstrumental nature of ritual activityas symbolic or expressive activity (i.e., communicative in some way),the fundamental contrast of symbolic versus instrumental under-scores how ritual activities are seen to differ from more \"practical\"ones. An interesting use of this perspective can be seen in studiesof \"rituals of resistance,\" which are concerned with subcultures andthe differentiation of group identities.8 In exploring \"symbolic\"forms of resistance to the dominant culture among working-classyouth groups in Great Britain, two studies suggest that such sym-bolic forms effectively constitute group identity and ethos but notpolitically effective forms of resistance, such as might be foundamong activists making a real (nonsymbolic?) break with the dom-inant ideology. That is, apolitical resistance to the dominant ide-ology is embodied in what the authors see as \"rituals of style\" incontrast to more politically pragmatic activities.Despite these sociological uses, the distinction between ritual andinstrumental activity can easily collapse into a distinction betweenthe rational and the irrational or the logical and the emotional.9Hence, the identification of ritual with symbolic as opposed toinstrumental action has also led to descriptions of ritual as catharticperformances that are responses to situations of anxiety or fear.10The great debate between Bronislav Malinowski and RaymondFirth on the relationship of ritual and anxiety essentially reflectedthe need to account for the existence of nonutilitarian practicesamong people who were incredibly practical in most things.11 Rit-ual, as activities that yield no practical result, it was argued, prob-ably function to reduce anxiety. In developing his theory,Malinowski went on to replicate the initial distinction betweenpractical and nonpractical activities by differentiating two forms ofritual as well, magical rites (for which the native can state a practicalpurpose) and religious rites (for which no practical purpose isgiven).IZ Another tack suggests that ritual exhibits and exaggeratesreal conflicts in order to release tensions and afford a type of socialcatharsis.13 It was along this line of thinking, of course, that V.Turner developed his early notion of ritual as social drama andhelped to usher in a 'performance' approach to ritual.14"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"72.  The Sense of RitualAmong the many problems attending efforts to distinguish ritualfrom other forms of human activity, most immediate is the fact thata distinction between technical practical and ritual symbolic activ-ities often reflects categories rather alien to the peoples involved.15Long ago Mauss pointed to the lack of such distinctions among\"primitive peoples\" as mandating analysis of the \"total man.\"16Aside from how alien the ritual—instrumental distinction may be tomany societies and the ease with which this distinction collapsesinto a problematic dichotomy of rational and irrational behavior,a third and more subtle critique has also been made of these ap-proaches to ritual. It focuses on the tendency to cast activity, ritualor otherwise, as an object and thus as the completed, or \"dead,\"execution of a system.17 When activity is analyzed and categorizedas something already finished, the very nature of activity as such islost. Although this critique was made by performance theorists, itis also implicit in practice theory, as I will show shortly.In recent years the second group of ritual theories, those thattend to see ritual as an aspect of all activity, has been dominant inthe literature, pushing out the older perspective of ritual as a distinctcategory of behavior. For example, in his challenge to the \"referent\"of the term \"ritual,\" Goody points out that \" 'routinisation', re-gularisation, repetition, lie at the basis of social life itself.\"18 Othershave argued that ritual is a form of communication just like lan-guage. Although he describes ritual as noninstrumental, Roy Rap-paport also notes that the formality associated with ritual is actuallya matter of a continuum of formality found in all behavior. Rap-paport uses the term \"ritual\" in the singular to refer to this formalaspect of all behavior, and \"rituals\" in the plural for those \"invar-iant events\" completely dominated by formality. Ultimately, he ar-gues, rituals communicate by virtue of their formal features, ratherthan their symbolic and expressive features, although these are thefeatures he finds least distinctive about ritual.19 Wuthnow invokesa simpler form of Rappaport's argument: he suggests that symbolicand utilitarian activities can be differentiated only in terms of thedegree to which they are expressive or communicative—and ritual,therefore, as the symbolic and expressive, constitutes some dimen-sion of all social activity/0Other theories stress the communicative nature of ritual in terms"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Action and Practice  73of either linguistic structures, primarily using Saussurean structur-alism, or performative structures, applying the work of Austin andSearle.21 Mary Douglas, for example, states that \"ritual is pre-eminently a form of communication\" composed of culturally nor-mal acts that have become distinctive by being diverted to specialfunctions where they are given magical efficacy.22 Leach also arguesthat \"we engage in rituals in order to transmit collective messagesto ourselves.\"23 Elsewhere, he goes further and suggests that \"speechitself is a form of ritual.\"24 Tambiah's performative approach, notedin Part I, also represents an example of this perspective.Among the various theories sharing a concern with the ritualdimension of all behavior, ethological studies of ritualization inanimals and humans are particularly serious about the universalfeatures of ritual. They cannot claim, however, the unqualified ap-preciation of other universalists.25 Sir Julian Huxley first configuredthe term \"ritualization\" to indicate \"the adaptive formalization orcanalization of emotionally motivated behavior, under the teleo-nomic pressure of natural selection.\"26 In Huxley's ethologicalframework, ritualization among both animals and humans served\"to secure more effective communication ('signalling') function,reduction of intra-group damage, or better intra-group bonding.\"27Richard Schechner emphasizes the idea that this ritual form ofcommunication arises in situations where any misunderstanding,or \"missignaling,\" would be catastrophic.28 The wide variety ofactivities that have come to be analyzed as ritualized behavior pat-terns—aggression and combat, song, play, sport, grooming, court-ing and mating, drama, dance, humor, art, and even thought itself—testifies to the promiscuous tendencies of this approach.29 It iden-tifies ritual with formal communicative functions and then findsritual to some degree in all or most activity.30 Some obvious prob-lems result. Making everything a matter of ritual to some degreebroadens the question to proportions impossible to organize. AsMeyer Fortes pointed out, it is a short step from the propositionthat everything is ritual to the practical reality that nothing is rit-ual.31 Playing with the application of a similarly broad-based un-derstanding of ritual, Levi-Strauss suggested the ludicrousconclusions that alien ethnographers might come to when observingour emotional adherence to the \"white line ritual\" while driving.32"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"74  The Sense of RitualAnother example is seen in the curious lengths to which Wuthnowtakes his analyses when he focuses on the ritual aspects of signalinga turn in traffic and the collective viewing of a television program.33With these objections an impasse appears to loom. On the onehand there is evidence that ritual acts are not a clear and closedcategory of social behavior. On the other hand many problemsattend the attempt to see ritual as a dimension of all or many formsof social behavior. How can the distinguishing features of so-calledritual activities be approached without cutting ritual off from whatit shares with social activity in general? One solution to this impassewould suggest that we refer to the particular circumstances andcultural strategies that generate and differentiate activities fromeach other. This approach, which assumes a focus on social actionin general, would then look to how and why a person acts so asto give some activities a privileged status vis-a-vis others. Ratherthan impose categories of what is or is not ritual, it may be moreuseful to look at how human activities establish and manipulatetheir own differentiation and purposes—in the very doing of theact within the context of other ways of acting.With this approach in mind, I will use the term 'ritualization' todraw attention to the way in which certain social actions strate-gically distinguish themselves in relation to other actions. In a verypreliminary sense, ritualization is a way of acting that is designedand orchestrated to distinguish and privilege what is being done incomparison to other, usually more quotidian, activities. As such,ritualization is a matter of various culturally specific strategies forsetting some activities off from others, for creating and privileginga qualitative distinction between the 'sacred' and the 'profane,' andfor ascribing such distinctions to realities thought to transcend thepowers of human actors.Practice TheoryIt is not easy to focus on how activity, in the very act, differentiatesitself from other activities. One needs a perspective on activity thatcan facilitate an exploration of the dynamics of social action ingeneral. The notion of 'practice' has been an obvious place to start.Heralded as the \"key symbol\" of an emerging theoretical orienta-"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Action and Practice  75tion in anthropology, practice would appear to be a ready tool toexplore ritualization as a way of acting.34 Ever since Karl Marx theterm has been invoked specifically to transcend dichotomies that\"wrongly divide\" human experience. Nonetheless, the term fre-quently succumbs to many of the expediencies of theoretical dis-course demonstrated in Part I.Some of the problems with the term go back to Marx and theflexible ways in which he used it.35 There appear to be two basicsenses to the notion of practice in his work. In the first sense theterm is explored as descriptive of human nature and all humanactivity. In a second sense the term appears to be more prescriptive,arguing for the proper way of being theoretical and using theory.In the first, descriptive sense, practice was a methodological focusthrough which to solve the problems posed by the work of Hegelon the one hand and Feuerbach on the other—namely, the rela-tionship between consciousness and reality, subject and object, ide-alism and materialism. In that sense, Marx defined practice as\"practical activity,\" a unity of consciousness and social being char-acterized by the potential to transform real existence. As such,practice was nothing less than the irreducible unity of real humanexistence itself. In this framework, practice mediates or reintegratessubject and object (consciousness and reality), which is to say thatthese polarized constructs are thought to exist only as they exist inand through practice. The second, or prescriptive, sense emerges inMarx's other analyses, where practice is seen as inextricably relatedto theory. Theirs is a dialectical relationship in which practice bothactualizes and tests theory while also providing the data for ongoingtheory. This dialectical unity of theory and practice was meant toindict the inadequacy of abstract thinking, knowledge, and truth.At the same time, it gave theory an important place in the practiceof political activity.These different uses of the term in Marx crop up again, of course,in the various emphases of more recent studies. Certainly the termhas been invoked to redress those \"bourgeois categories\" that falselydistinguish the individual from society or the sign from the refer-ent.36 For example, \"signifying practices,\" a term coined by the TelQuel circle in Paris, not only opposes \"the prevailing notion of atransparent relation between sign and referent, signification andreality,\" but also emphasizes the creativity over and above the mere"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"j6  The Sense of Ritualreproductivity of practice.37 Language, art, and style, as examplesof signifying practices, have been analyzed as active forces thatcreate or transform reality.Writers only partially aligned with Marxism will also invoke theterm practice as a way to evade what they see as the materialistempiricism of much traditional ethnology on the one hand and asthe ahistorical abstract idealism of Saussure's or Levi-Strauss'sstructuralism on the other. In this context, practice is used to denotea dialectic of the material and the symbolic, the real and the per-ceived, the structure and the act. That is, practice synthesizes andtranscends the materialism and idealism associated with each poleof the dialectic itself. For example, despite his judgment that Marx'spraxis concerned only material activity and as such was unable toaccount for \"the symbolic order of culture,\" Sahlins attempted torescue the term in the guise of \"cultural praxis.\" The notion ofcultural praxis is used to articulate a dynamic at the heart of socialand cultural life which cannot be reduced to either pole of thedialectic of which it is composed—langue and parole, or structureand history.38Whereas Sahlins uses the notion of practice to formulate a theoryof culture that can recognize symbolic and historical dimensions,the notion is also used by those concerned with the related issue ofsocial agency. These anthropologists are wont to posit practice insome relation to culture so as to explicate the dynamics by whichthe social world is both structured and structuring, that is, bothshaped by practice and shaping of practice in turn. Hence, JeanComaroff uses the term to indicate the process of communicativesocial action by which persons, in acting upon an external andobjective order of power relations, construct themselves as socialbeings, molded but not determined. The construction of socialbeings is simultaneously the very generation or reproduction ofculture.39 For Ortner as well, the system of structures that are thebasis of a culture interact with 'human practice' to yield cultureinternalized as the 'self in social actors.40As a term that is designed to represent the synthetic unity ofconsciousness and social being within human activity, 'practice'appears to be a powerful tool with which to embrace or transcendall analogous dichotomies. And that, of course, is one of its prob-lems. Even in Marx's usage the term comes to play two roles,"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Action and Practice  77encouraging a slip from one level of argument to another. In onerole practice is seen as the synthetic unity and resolution of thedichotomy of consciousness and social being. Simultaneously, how-ever, practice is also cast in a second role where, as synthetic prac-tical activity, it is contrasted with theory as the activity ofconsciousness (or with \"structure,\" as in Sahlins) with which itforms the poles of another dichotomy. This second dichotomy isfrequently invoked in order to resolve it into a third term, thedialectical synthesis of \"historical process\" (or again, as in Sahlins'sanalysis, \"cultural praxis\").A second problem that afflicts the Marxist usage of the termpractice is the inherent privileging of terms afforded by positingfundamental oppositions. One term gradually comes to dominatethe other until the first term is seen as the source of the secondterm. In the extensive literature on formulations of the relationshipof base and superstructure in Marxism, for example, consciousnesshas been variously described as caused by practice (e.g., the super-structure caused or produced by the base) or as expressive of prac-tice (e.g., the superstructure expresses the real conditions of thebase).41 In both cases, consciousness becomes derivative. In a similarpattern in cultural anthropology the notion of 'structure' oftencomes to dominate 'act,' rendering activity merely expressive ofmore primary structures.4*The privileged terms in the dichotomies of Marxists on the onehand and cultural anthropologists on the other differ, of course.Anthropological arguments, such as those of Geertz or Sahlins,subtly privilege thought, structure, and the synchronic, thereby ren-dering act, performance, and the diachronic as secondary and de-pendent. Marxists, however, with the exception of Louis Althusser,privilege practice, thus appearing to be less committed to the con-stitution of theoretical discourse and the status of the theorist thanto historical process and the importance of political struggle.43A third problem afflicting practice theory arises with the me-diating role that practice is meant to play. Practice is said to mediateconsciousness and social being, or structure and act, which in turnare said to exist only in and through practice. However, in actualfact, the concept of practice is a secondary and unstable synthesisof these pairs of categories and it tends to keep collapsing into itsunderlying components. Thus, practice does not really mediate: it"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"78  The Sense of Ritualis 'constructed' in order to generate a synthetic abstraction thatserves as the object and method of a particular discourse. Practiceis not deconstructed to see how practical activity itself might giverise to 'consciousness' or 'structure.' Practice continually gets caughtin these analytical patterns because it is being used for a particularend, namely, to generate a discourse based upon an object of anal-ysis tied to a concomitant method of analysis. This purposive endis signaled by arguments that explicitly address the need to tran-scend the dilemma of objectivism and subjectivism.Jameson's The Political Unconscious, a manifesto for neo-Marxist literary analysis, opens with a discussion of the formaldilemma of all cultural study today: \"the struggle for priority be-tween models and history,\" between theory and history, and theoryand practice. Jameson maintains that the sterility of theory whichrewrites texts in terms of its own aesthetic on the one hand andthe inaccessible past of historicism on the other can be transcendedonly through the practice of Marxist political-historical theory.44For Jameson, therefore, in the end it is the theorist's practice ofMarxist theory that is seen to resolve the bifurcations of theory andpractice or models and history. We saw a version of this model inthe discussion of Geertz in Part I.Pierre Bourdieu elaborates an influential analysis of practicewhich also exemplifies the traditional strengths and weaknesses ofthis term. The opening pages of his Outline of a Theory of Practicedescribe the need to transcend the subjective categories of nativeexperience as well as the objective categories of the outside ob-server.45 His science of practice, he argues, will not only overcomethe contradictions of objectivism and subjectivism, but it will saveboth by making them into necessary but incomplete stages in thedialectical method of his science.46 He then defines practice itselfin terms of a dialectical relationship between a structured environ-ment (by which he invokes \"objectivist structures,\" which are notnecessarily the real world but an agent's practical interpretation ofthe world) and the structured dispositions engendered in peoplewhich lead them to reproduce the environment even in a trans-formed form. He calls this a \"dialectic of objectification and in-corporation.\"47 Hence, in a second stage, the object of analysis,practice, is also a dialectic, a dialectic of \"objectivism\" and \"sub-jectivism.\" The method and the object constitute each other."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Action and Practice  79Ortner takes a somewhat different approach. She lays out a theoryof practice that is \"a theory of the relationship between the struc-tures of society and culture on the one hand, and the nature ofhuman action on the other.\"48 Practice theory, in this formulation,continuously translates from action to structure and structure toaction. Any action is an instance of practice //the theorist establishesits relationship to structure. At times it appears that Ortner is notso much proposing a theory of practice, with practice as the objectof scrutiny out there, but a way of analyzing that involves theconstruction of the category of practice. At the root of this dis-tinction is, of course, Marx's two uses of practice—as the natureof all human activity and as a way of doing theory. Ortner doesnot emphasize how a focus on practice, or even the construct ofpractice, is a means for appreciating action and structure as a dy-namic whole. She is not interested in synthesizing wholes. On thecontrary, Ortner creates oppositions (like structure and action, aswell as objectivism and subjectivism) and resists any explicit syn-thesis that resolves or embraces them. She speaks of practice theoryas a \"controlling framework\" in which such real oppositions, whichmight never be mediated, are \"accepted\" instead.49In his discussion of habitus Bourdieu presents yet another solutionto the problem of where and how to formulate practice. This Latinterm was first used by Mauss to describe the culturally acquiredabilities and faculties associated with his concept of the \"totalman.\"50 For Bourdieu, the habitus is, most simply, the set of ha-bitual dispositions through which people \"give shape and form tosocial conventions.\"51 A more complete definition would add thatthe habitus is the principle by which individual and collective prac-tices are produced and the matrix in which objective structures arerealized within the (subjective) dispositions that produce practices.Bourdieu implies that the habitus is an instance of practice, anirreducible 'unit' of culture that cannot be broken down into anyautonomous, constitutive forces. In this analysis, practice is real,but action and structure as components of practice would be meretheoretical constructs. That is to say, 'cultural structures' and 'theact itself exist nowhere except in the theorist's analysis of thehabitus. The types of structures that Ortner and Sahlins are con-cerned to affirm are, in Bourdieu's framework, nothing more thanthe schemes implicit in practice.52"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"8o  The Sense of RitualHabitus is an awkward but explicit formulation of the real insightwithin Bourdieu's work on practice, namely, the need \"to confrontthe act itself.\" With regard to myth, for example, he argues thatwe should approach a myth neither as an object (a completed eventlaid out neatly for analysis) nor in terms of some mythopoeic sub-jectivity, but as the very act of myth-making. It is possible to con-front the act itself in this way, he writes, only by addressing theprinciple that generates, organizes, and unifies all practices—\"thesocially informed body, with its tastes and distastes, its compulsionsand repulsions, with, in a word, all its senses.\" These senses, Bour-dieu goes on to explain, include \"the traditional five senses—whichnever escape the structuring action of jsocial determinisms—but alsothe sense of necessity and the sense of duty, the sense of directionand the sense of reality, the sense of balance and the sense of beauty,common sense and the sense of the sacred, tactical sense and thesense of responsibility, business sense and the sense of propriety,the sense of humor and the sense of absurdity, moral sense and thesense of practicality, and so on.\"53In most societies the \"sense of ritual\" would be a vital additionto this list. It is through a socially acquired sense of ritual thatmembers of a society know how to improvise a birthday celebration,stage an elaborate wedding, or rush through a minimally adequatefuneral.54 Of course, possession of this sense of ritual does not meanthat members of a community always agree on how to do a ritualor what to make of it. Disagreements over ritual can be as fierceor as casual as those over honor or artistic beauty. Yet with regardto Geertz's example of the Javanese child's funeral, for example, afocus on the sense of ritual would shift the emphasis from how therite failed to fulfill Geertz's theoretical model of ritual, as well asJavanese ideals of iklas and rukun, to how minimal ritual procedureswere improvised with sufficient respect for tradition that the childwas considered buried more or less satisfactorily.55Confronting the ritual act itself, and therein eschewing ritual assome object to be analyzed or some subjectivity to be fathomed,would involve asking how ritual activities, in their doing, generatedistinctions between what is or is not acceptable ritual. From thisperspective one could not seek to construct a theory or model ofritual practice. Rather one could attempt to describe the strategiesof the ritualized act by deconstructing some of the intricacies of its"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Action and Practice  81cultural logic. This is the perspective that will be developed in therest of Part II.56 This exploration of the distinctive strategies andcultural logic that lie behind ritual activities may also begin toilluminate the distinctive strategies of theoretical practices.The Features of PracticeTo focus on the act itself practice must be taken as a nonsyntheticand irreducible term for human activity. I will use the term tohighlight four features of human activity. Practice is (i) situational;(2.) strategic; (3) embedded in a misrecognition of what it is in factdoing; and (4) able to reproduce or reconfigure a vision of the orderof power in the world, or what I will call 'redemptive hegemony.'Each of these features will be discussed individually and then usedas a basis with which to describe ritual activity.First, human activity is situational, which is to say that much ofwhat is important to it cannot be grasped outside of the specificcontext in which it occurs. When abstracted from its immediatecontext, an activity is not quite the same activity. Practice mayembody determinative influences deriving from other situations, butpractice is not the mere expression or effect of these influences.Indeed, it can be said that a focus on the act itself renders these'influences' (structures or sources) nonexistent except insofar as theyexist within the act itself.57Jonathan Culler makes this point in a different context whenhe argues that analysis of \"the relationship between a literarywork and a social and historical reality is not one of reflectedcontent but of a play of forms\" within the work itself. \"The in-terplay between a literary work and its historical ground lies inthe way its formal devices exploit, transform, and supplement aculture's way of producing meaning.\"58 Yet Culler focuses solelyon literary practices within the text as an object and not, as ourforegoing analysis demands, on textual practices per se. There-fore, it is useful to turn to Edward Said's example. Said pro-vides a complementary corrective with his description of the\"worldliness\" of texts, by which he means that texts are cul-tural entities that act in the world.59 Internal textual analysis,for which the text is an object, he argues, will lose itself in an"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"8 2  The Sense of Ritual\"endless deferral of meaning,\" never grasping that the text isnot a disembodied object but a practical set of actions involvingthe realities of power and authority. Indeed, Said is concernedwith \"how a text, by being a text, by insisting upon and em-ploying all the devices of textuality\" functions in the world to\"dislodge other texts.\"60 His insights into textual practices areuseful for thinking about ritual practices as well.As a second feature of human activity, practice is inherently stra-tegic, manipulative, and expedient.61 The logic of practice (and thereis a logic of sorts) is not that of an intellectualist logic, arguesBourdieu. Practice, as real activity in time, by its very nature dodgesthe relations of intellectualist logic and excludes the questions askedby the analyst.6* Its practical or instrumental logic is strategic andeconomic in that it remains as implicit and rudimentary as possible.Practice, therefore, is a ceaseless play of situationally effectiveschemes, tactics, and strategies—\"the intentionless invention of reg-ulated improvisation.\"63The third feature intrinsic to practice is a fundamental 'misre-cognition' of what it is doing, a misrecognition of its limits andconstraints, and of the relationship between its ends and its means.64An appreciation of the dynamics of misrecognition as such goesback to the Marxist argument that a society could not exist \"unlessit disguised to itself the real basis of that existence.\"65 However,the idea has been developed in a variety of ways—in the notion ofaporia developed by Jacques Derrida, in Althusser's notion of \"asighting in an oversight,\" or in Paul DeMan's discussion of \"blind-ness and insight.\"Bourdieu provides a clear illustration of this aspect of practiceby reexamining the dynamics of gift exchange.66 To work effec-tively, the practice of traditional gift-giving presupposes a \"delib-erate oversight\" of the \"fake circulation of fake coin\" which makesup symbolic exchange.67 What is not seen by those involved is thatwhich objective analysis takes to be the whole explanation of theexchange, namely, a reciprocal swapping of items with no intrinsicvalue. Misrecognition is what \"enables the gift or counter-gift tobe seen and experienced as an inaugural act of generosity.\"68 Whatis experienced in gift-giving is the voluntary, irreversible, delayed,and strategic play of gift and countergift; it is the experience ofthese dimensions that actually establishes the value of the objects"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"and the gestures. The context of practice, Bourdieu stresses, is neverclear cut but full of indeterminacy, ambiguities, and equivocations.Hence, 'theoretical reconstruction,' as a description in terms ofgeneral laws, removes the very conditions that afford misrecogni-tion and the social efficacy of gift exchange. By abstracting the actfrom its temporal situation and reducing its convoluted strategiesto a set of reversible structures, theoretical analysis misses the realdynamics of practice.69A fourth characteristic of practice, closely intertwined with thefeatures situationality, strategy, and misrecognition, has to do withthe motivational dynamics of agency, the will to act, which isalso integral to the context of action. It addresses the questionof why people do something or anything, but in a form thatattempts to avoid the reductionism of most self-interest theory.This dimension of practice can be evoked through the concept of'redemptive hegemony,' which is a synthesis of Kenelm Burridge'snotion of the \"redemptive process\" and Antonio Gramsci's notionof \"hegemony.\"70The term hegemony has been used to go beyond more traditionalunderstandings of power and social process, specifically, that rulingpower is expressed in direct techniques of coercion, that culture isthe 'whole social process,' and that ideology is a system of falsemeanings expressing the interests of particular classes.71 Gramsci'sterm recognizes the dominance and subordination that exist withinpeople's practical and un-self-conscious awareness of the world. Itis a term that politicizes our understanding of what David Laitincalls \"the symbolic framework that reigns as common-sense.\"72This awareness is a lived system of meanings, a more or less unifiedmoral order, which is confirmed and nuanced in experience to con-struct a person's sense of reality and identity. As such, this practicalawareness of the world is a lived ordering of power, a construal ofpower that is also, inevitably, a misconstrual since it is power asenvisioned and encountered in very particular situations. A lived'ordering' of power means that hegemony is neither singular normonolithic; to be at all it must be reproduced, renewed, and evenresisted in an enormous variety of practices. Similar to Burridge'sconcept of the redemptive process, Laitin sees hegemony not onlyas a lived consciousness and moral order, but also as a prestigeorder.73Action and Practice83"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"84  The Sense of RitualBurridge's notion of a redemptive process as the basis of culturallife provides a useful framework for bringing into focus the actualworkings of this notion of hegemonic power. Burridge defines theredemptive process as that process by which, in a given context ofassumptions about power, persons \"attempt to discharge their ob-ligations in relation to the moral imperatives of the community.\"74This redemptive process, he suggests, not only involves assumptionsabout power and the moral order; it appears to enable people both\"to perceive the truth of things\" and to be guaranteed that \"theyare indeed perceiving the truth of things.\"75 An insight basic toBurridge's formulation is the idea that people construe power re-lations in such a way that (i) these power relations are reproducedin various ways, ^) people have a sense of their place in someordering of relations, and (3) they can envision the efficacy of actingwithin that ordering of relations. People reproduce relationships ofpower and domination, but not in a direct, automatic, or mechan-istic way; rather, they reproduce them through their particular con-strual of those relations, a construal that affords the actor the senseof a sphere of action, however minimal.As a practical construal or consciousness of the system of powerrelations and as a framework for action, redemptive hegemonysuggests that human practice is characterized by relations of dom-inance and subjugation. These relations, however, are present inpractice by means of the practical values, obligations, and persistentenvisioning—as both an assumption and an extension of the sys-tem—of a state of prestige within this ordering of power. This visionexists as a practical consciousness of the world (common sense)and a sense of one's options for social action. It is also a vision ofempowerment that is rooted in the actor's perceptions and expe-riences of the organization of power. Although awkward, the term'redemptive hegemony' denotes the way in which reality is expe-rienced as a natural weave of constraint and possibility, the fabricof day-to-day dispositions and decisions experienced as a field forstrategic action. Rather than an embracing ideological vision of thewhole, it conveys a biased, nuanced rendering of the ordering ofpower so as to facilitate the envisioning of personal empowermentthrough activity in the perceived system. The truism that \"everyestablished order tends to produce... the naturalization of its ownarbitrariness\" indicates a process in which agents not only accede"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Action and Practice  85to a shared sense of reality but also effectively reproduce that realityin ways that continue to empower them to act.76Gramsci proposed that hegemonic ordering of power requirespeople both to envision and to suppress, to self-censor and to ap-propriate liberties to themselves. He argued that ruling classes es-tablish dominance not merely through overt mechanisms of controlbut through a climate of thought to which the oppressed classessubscribe. This theory of ideology suggests what has been called ageneral \"strategy of containment.\"77 It also implies what othershave made explicit, that ideology is not a disseminated body ofideas but the way in which people live the relationships betweenthemselves and their world, a type of necessary illusion.78 To main-tain and adapt their assumptions about the order of reality personsand groups engage in degrees of self-censorship or misrecognition,as well as legitimization and objectification in the guise of morestable social structures.In sum, a redemptive hegemony is not an explicit ideology or asingle and bounded doxa that defines a culture's sense of reality. Itis a strategic and practical orientation for acting, a frameworkpossible only insofar as it is embedded in the act itself. As such, ofcourse, the redemptive hegemony of practice does not reflect realitymore or less effectively; it creates it more or less effectively. Toanalyze practice in terms of its vision of redemptive hegemony is,therefore, to formulate the unexpressed assumptions that constitutethe actor's strategic understanding of the place, purpose, and tra-jectory of the act.Although tailored to the needs of this inquiry into ritual, theconcept of redemptive hegemony is akin to several other theoriesof practical activity. David Cannadine and Simon Price imply asimilar notion when they ask how activity projects images of cosmicorder on to the plane of human experience.79 Leach's idea that\"social structure in practical situations (as contrasted with the so-ciologist's abstract model) consists of a set of ideas about the dis-tribution of power between persons and groups of persons\" alsobears on the discussion here.80 Similarly, when Geertz argues thatany understanding of the Balinese negara would have to elaboratenot just structures of action or thought but a poetics of power asopposed to a mechanics of power, he also implies a strategic senseof the ordering of power.81"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"86  The Sense of RitualJameson stresses the interaction of misrecognition and somethinglike redemptive hegemony in his description of the method under-lying hermeneutical analysis of cultural objects as socially symbolicacts.82 Such analysis, he argues, must first undertake the essentially\"negative\" hermeneutical task of unmasking or demystifying theways in which a cultural artifact fulfills a specific ideological mis-sion, namely, its resolution of real contradictions in disguised forms.Yet that alone will not suffice. Hermeneutical analysis must alsoundertake the second, \"positive\" task of determining how that ar-tifact simultaneously projected a type of Utopian power by sym-bolically affirming a specific historical and class form of collectiveunity.83Althusser's analytical method gives particular attention to thethird feature, the strategic blindness of practice. In his determinationthe fundamental principle of action is the \"problematic\" (problema-tique).8* The problematic is essentially the cultural-historical limitswithin which practices operate—that is, within which practicesaddress the particular problems posed for them (for the superstruc-ture, the dominant ideology) by the historical moment (or the in-frastructure).85 As such, Althusser's problematic may be comparedto (but not equated with) Bourdieu's habitus, described as the setof structured and structuring dispositions in dialectical interactionwith the conditions in which these dispositions are operating (thelatter being the particular state of the habitus at any one moment).86However, Althusser's term also suggests an implicit notion of re-demptive hegemony with its description of the lived' ordering ofpower which actors see themselves addressing or countering, butwhich is reproduced in a transformed way in their actions.According to Althusser, to understand a set of practices it isnecessary to question the relationship of those practices to theirintent or object.87 In looking at someone doing something, for ex-ample, we should ask about the relationship between 'the doing'and 'the something.' This is to question the particular object of thepractice as well as the particularity of the practice's relationship tothis object. In Althusser's words, one puts to practice the questionof the specific difference between itself and its \"object-intent.\" Thatis, with regard to the unity of the practice with its object-intent,one asks what distinguishes this particular unity from the unity of"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Action and Practice  87other practices and their object-intent. This is to question the 'ob-ject-unity' of a particular action.88There are really two 'questionings' involved in this inquiry intothe unity of practice and its intent. The first questioning asks whatthe practice 'sees,' that is, its conscious 'given,' the questions it asksor situations it addresses, its objective or avowed purpose—in otherwords, the 'something' in 'doing something.' The second question-ing, which Althusser calls \"symptomatic,\" is different.89 It questionsnot the 'something' of 'doing something,' but the 'doing.' Althusserargues that to question the 'doing' is to question the \"oversights\"of a practice, what a specific practice does not see, what it cannotSc^j—namely, the problem or situation that \"is only visible in sofar as it is invisible.\"90 A practice does not see itself do what itactually does. This oversight does not concern the object-intentconsciously sighted by the practice but the very ability to see practiceitself.In simpler terms, we can say that practice sees what it intends toaccomplish, but it does not see the strategies it uses to producewhat it actually does accomplish, a new situation. Althusser showsthat practice will give an answer to a question that was never posed:the effectiveness of practice is not the resolution of the problematicto which it addresses itself but a complete change in the terms ofthe problematic, a change it does not see itself make.91To understand how there can be an oversight in the act of sight-ing, or an 'undoing' in the act of doing, it is necessary to reorganizeour traditional concept of knowledge and its \"mirror myths ofimmediate vision\" and think of knowledge also as practice or pro-duction. Practice sees the problem it is intent upon; it does not seewhat it itself produces in the very operation of practice: it does notsee the production process which constitutes the 'object.' For ex-ample, as demonstrated in Chapter i, ritual theory, a form of prac-tice, does not see how it creates its own object, 'ritual,' in the verycourse of determining a method appropriate to some object thoughtto exist independently of theory, method, and discourse. Practice\"does not see what it does: its production of a new answer withouta question, and simultaneously the production of a new latent ques-tion contained by default in this new answer.\"92Practice, continues Althusser, sees itself as generated by a prob-"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"88  The Sense of Rituallematic, but it produces a new problematic without knowing it,usually convinced indeed that it is still on the terrain of the old one.\"Its blindness and its 'oversight' lie in this misunderstanding, be-tween what it produces and what it sees, in this 'substitution,' whichMarx elsewhere calls a 'play on words' (Wortspiel) that is neces-sarily impenetrable to its author.\"93 Why is practice blind to whatit produces? Because it is still fixed on the old question, the oldhorizon, on which the new problem is not visible. Furthermore, hepoints out, \"what is at stake in the production of this new problemcontained unwittingly in the new answer is not a particular newobject which has emerged among other, already identified objects,like an unexpected guest at a family reunion; on the contrary, whathas happen :d involves a transformation of the entire terrain andits entire horizon, which are the background against which the newproblem is produced.\"94 Just as Bourdieu sees practice as the con-tinual production of a new state of the habitus which generatesnew practices in turn, so Althusser sees practice as the constantproduction of a new problematic out of an old one.95Ritual necessarily shares these four features of practice. More tothe point, the practical logic by which ritual acts are generated vis-a-vis other ways of acting, ritualization, will be more visible interms of these four features.RitualizationThe term 'ritualization' has some pertinent history that needs to bereviewed. Two main schools employ the term: the first has devel-oped from the work of Gluckman; the second is more or less linkedto the ethological perspective pioneered by Huxley. Nearly fortyyears ago, Gluckman contrasted the \"ritualization\" of social rela-tionships with \"ritualism\" in order to extend the notion of ritualbeyond a narrow and somewhat traditional connection with or-ganized religious institutions and formal worship.96 His work in-spired a great deal of sociological literature on ritualization innonreligious frameworks, such as Murray Edelman's study of ri-tualization in the political conflicts attending industry-labor unionnegotiations. Edelman refines the notion of ritualization to describea process to which a conflicted relationship is subjected in order to"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Action and Practice  89facilitate both the escalation and resolution of a struggle that oth-erwise would destroy the relationship.97In the second school, Huxley's use of the term has also servedto extend the traditional notion of ritual. Through his influence,ritualization has been adopted both by those who explicitly ac-knowledge the relevancy of ethology for the study of human ritual,such as Rappaport, and by those who do not make any such ac-knowledgments, such as John Beattie.98 For others not directly con-cerned with Gluckman's or Huxley's lines of thinking, the term isused somewhat more simply to emphasize ritual as activity. This istrue for Frits Staal's arguments about the meaning of ritual residingin the structure of the act itself. Yet it is also true for Mary C.Bateson, who uses the term to describe both the development ofrituals on the one hand and a particular mode of action on theother. In the latter sense Bateson argues against the effectiveness ofa delimited category of action called \"ritual,\" as I did earlier, point-ing out that ritualization is a \"more-or-less phenomenon\" thatshould be compared to other types of social interactions in termsof \"texture,\" not \"structure.\"99Ritualization is now frequently the preferred term particularlyfor studies focusing on ritual in technologically advanced societies.Eric Hobsbawn speaks of ritualization to describe the process of\"inventing traditions\" in modern societies.100 Crystal Lane's anal-ysis of the development of modern Soviet ritual explicitly adoptsthe term from Gluckman's work to denote the acting out of socialrelationships in ritual form in order to express and alter them.101Common to most of these perspectives is an appreciation of theemergence of ritual forms for the purpose of social control and/orsocial communication. Ritual forms of behavior are seen to controlby defining, modeling, and communicating social relations.102Hence, these studies call attention to the conscious or unconsciousdeployment of ritual as a type of social strategy. Indeed, for moststudies that use the term, ritualization is seen to involve the formal'modeling' of valued relationships so as to promote legitimationand internalization of those relations and their values.My use of the term 'ritualization' will build on some of theseimplications while attempting to focus more clearly on (i) howritualization as practice distinguishes itself from other practices and(z) what it accomplishes in doing so."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"90  The Sense of RitualSemiologically speaking, just as a sign or a text derives its sig-nificance by virtue of its relationship to other signs and texts, basicto ritualization is the inherent significance it derives from its inter-play and contrast with other practices.103 From this viewpoint, therewould be little content to any attempt to generate a cross-culturalor universal meaning to ritual.104 Likewise, this view suggests thatthe significance of ritual behavior lies not in being an entirely sep-arate way of acting, but in how such activities constitute themselvesas different and in contrast to other activities. Even in theoreticalanalysis, ritual should not be analyzed by being lifted out of thecontext formed by other ways of acting in a cultural situation.Acting ritually is first and foremost a matter of nuanced contrastsand the evocation of strategic, value-laden distinctions.Viewed as practice, ritualization involves the very drawing, inand through the activity itself, of a privileged distinction betweenways of acting, specifically between those acts being performed andthose being contrasted, mimed, or implicated somehow. That is,intrinsic to ritualization are strategies for differentiating itself—tovarious degrees and in various ways—from other ways of actingwithin any particular culture. At a basic level, ritualization is theproduction of this differentiation. At a more complex level, ritual-ization is a way of acting that specifically establishes a privilegedcontrast, differentiating itself as more important or powerful. Suchprivileged distinctions may be drawn in a variety of culturally spe-cific ways that render the ritualized acts dominant in status.For example, distinctions between eating a regular meal and par-ticipating in the Christian eucharistic meal are redundantly drawnin every aspect of the ritualized meal, from the type of larger familygathering around the table to the distinctive periodicity of the mealand the insufficiency of the food for physical nourishment. It isimportant to note that the features of formality, fixity, and repe-tition are not intrinsic to this ritualization or to ritual in general.Theoretically, ritualization of the meal could employ a different setof strategies to differentiate it from conventional eating, such asholding the meal only once in a person's lifetime or with too muchfood for normal nourishment. The choice of strategies would de-pend in part on which ones could most effectively render the mealsymbolically dominant to its conventional counterparts. The choicewould also depend on the particular 'work' the ritualized acts aimed"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Action and Practice  91to accomplish in a situation. Given this analysis, ritualization couldinvolve the exact repetition of a centuries-old tradition or delib-erately radical innovation and improvisation, as in certain formsof liturgical experimentation or performance art.An even simpler example might contrast the routine activity ofbuying some regularly used article of clothing for a spouse or child(such as gym socks) and the ritualized version of buying a similarbut different article (argyle socks) and giving it as a gift. Theseactivities are differentiated in the very doing and derive their sig-nificance from the contrast implicity set up between them. Routinegiving plays off ritualized giving and vice versa; they define eachother. The Christian mass and the gift are not models for a normalmeal or family shopping; they are strategic versions of them. Yetthis is not to say that ritualization is simply acting differently. Oth-erwise, buying mismatched socks at a bargain table—an act thatmay communicate simply insofar as it differs from a routine set ofexpectations—would qualify as ritual.This foregoing elaboration of the basic principle of privilegeddifferentiation expressed in what and how something is done is notthe sole characteristic of ritual action. I regard it as basic here forhow it highlights a fundamental strategic and contextual quality ofritual action. By virtue of this quality, what is ritual is alwayscontingent, provisional, and defined by difference.From the perspective of ritualization the categories of sacred andprofane appear in a different light. Ritualization appreciates howsacred and profane activities are differentiated in the performingof them, and thus how ritualization gives rise to (or creates) thesacred as such by virtue of its sheer differentiation from the pro-fane.105 Whereas Durkheim defined religion and ritual as that whichis addressed to the sacred, the approach presented here is an inverseof his, showing how a particular way of acting draws the type offlexible distinctions that yield notions and categories like 'ritual' or'religion.' The relative clarity and flexibility of the boundaries, ofcourse, are also a highly strategic matter in a particular culturalcommunity and are best understood in terms of the concretesituation.106There is little explicit consensus concerning the intrinsic featuresof ritual, and some do not believe there to be any features intrinsicto ritual.107 Nonetheless, certain features—formality, fixity, and"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"92,  The Sense of Ritualrepetition—have been consistently and repeatedly cited as centralto ritual and ritualization. Almost all theorists of ritual start withone or more of these obvious physical characteristics and attemptto link it to any of a variety of authoritative or communicativefunctions also ascribed to ritual. Formality as a matter of embel-lishment or repetition as a matter of redundancy has each beendefined in turn as central to the communicative functions of ritual.Rituals come to be defined as a particularly intensive form of com-munication by virtue of their formality and repetition.108 Fixity ofthe times and places of ritual activities, as well as the exact gesturesto be enacted, also tends to be linked to the authoritative modelingof ritual.109Yet if ritual is interpreted in terms of practice, it becomes clearthat formality, fixity, and repetition are not intrinsic qualities ofritual so much as they are a frequent, but not universal strategy forproducing ritualized acts. That is to say, formalizing a gathering,following a fixed agenda and repeating that activity at periodicintervals, and so on, reveal potential strategies of ritualization be-cause these ways of acting are the means by which one group ofactivities is set off as distinct and privileged vis-a-vis other activities.Yet in a different situation, informality might be stressed to dom-inate other ways of acting. For example, the formal activities ofgathering for a Catholic mass distinguish this 'meaP from dailyeating activities, but the informality of a mass celebrated in a privatehome with a folk guitar and kitchen utensils is meant to set upanother contrast (the spontaneous authentic celebration versus theformal and inauthentic mass) which the informal service expects todominate. It is only necessary that the cultural context include someconsensus concerning the opposition and relative values of personalsincerity and intimate participation vis-a-vis routinized and imper-sonal participation.Since practice is situational and strategic, people engage in ri-tualization as a practical way of dealing with some specific circum-stances. Ritual is never simply or solely a matter of routine, habit,or \"the dead weight of tradition.\" Indeed, routinization and ha-bitualization may be strategies in certain cultural situations, but somight the infrequent yet periodic reproduction of a complex ritualtradition. Similarly, ritualization may maximize or minimize itsdifferentiation from other forms of practice. The degree of differ-"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Action and Practice  93entiation is itself strategic and part of the logic and efficacy of theact. Hence, ritualization can be characterized in general only to arather limited extent since the idiom of its differentiation of actingwill be, for the most part, culturally specific.110Aside from the drawing of a contrast between the ritualized ac-tivities that are being performed and other forms of social behavior,another feature is also fundamental to the practice of ritualizationper se. The strategies of ritualization are particularly rooted in thebody, specifically, the interaction of the social body within a sym-bolically constituted spatial and temporal environment. Essentialto ritualization is the circular production of a ritualized body whichin turn produces ritualized practices. Ritualization is embeddedwithin the dynamics of the body defined within a symbolicallystructured environment. An important corollary to this is the factthat ritualization is a particularly 'mute' form of activity. It is de-signed to do what it does without bringing what it is doing acrossthe threshold of discourse or systematic thinking."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"5The Ritual BodyIn the last ten years the 'body' has emerged as a major analyticfocus in a number of disciplines. The reasons for this perspectivemay involve the development and interaction of several lines ofthought: the rich tradition of anthropological studies of the body;the critique of traditional objectivism and its \"mentalist\" or \"mind-centered\" notions of knowledge; and the impact of feminist andgender studies, which, in some circles, have inspired a new \"erotics\"of interpretative practice.111Anthropological exploration of the codes and classification sys-tems of body symbolism has vividly illustrated how social categoriesshape the decoration, perceptions, and dispositions of the body. Incontrast to the Darwinian argument that bodily expressions, par-ticularly facial expressions, are genetically determined and thereforeboth natural and universal, a series of early studies by Durkheim,Mauss, and Robert Hertz demonstrated that bodily expressions aresocial and learned.11'\" Although the debate on the biological or socialorigins of human behavior and classification was just getting underway at that time—and is far from over—this early stage of researchidentified the body as a social construction in the image of societyand a microcosm of the universe.113More recently, Douglas explored the social body as \"a highlyrestricted medium of expression\" and a key to the relationship ofself, society, and cosmos.114 V. Turner pushed the primacy of thebody further by arguing that it is the human organism itself, andnot society, that is the fons et origo of all classification.115 Goffman,in turn, examined the molding of the body into a nearly mnemonic94"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The Ritual Body  95encapsulation of the cultural principles that organize society.116Some have seen the body as mediating the simple dialectical inter-action of the individual and society; others have explored how theconstruction of cultural reality focuses on the body, which in turnexperiences that construction as natural.117 Still others see the bodyas the \"foremost of all metaphors\" for a society's perception andorganization of itself.118 Certainly a consensus of sorts has emergedgranting the body a critical place in the social construction ofreality.119A second line of thinking about the body emerged in connectionwith a concern to undermine the framework of 'disembodied' ob-jectivism that has constituted the dominant model used in the hu-manities and social sciences. After years of guerrilla activity againstthe dualities of mind-body, individual-society, and message-me-dium, this concern is now readily articulated in many fields. Onehears of the \"embodied\" mind, the \"socially embedded\" or \"sociallyconstituted\" person, not to mention the \"media-massaged\" mes-sage. The works of Richard Rorty in philosophy and of GeorgeLakoff and Mark Johnson in linguistics, or Gilles Deleuze and FelixGuattari's critique of psychoanalysis and capitalism, are just a fewinfluential examples of this movement.IZOLakoff provides a particularly provocative formulation of thisperspective, one with relevance for the issue of ritual action. Inter-spersed with a careful critique of traditional objectivism, Lakoffdemonstrates how the concepts and conceptual categories that bothcomprise and organize knowledge are neither abstract in nature norindependent of the body. Instead, they are directly or indirectly\"embodied.\"121 Similarly, Johnson has countered the claims of ob-jectivism by exploring \"the indispensable forms of imagination\"that emerge from \"bodily experience\" and profoundly affect humanreasoning.122Lakoff's argument, for example, presumes the anthropologicalanalyses noted previously and opposes them in several importantways. He cites evidence illustrating how classification systems areculturally determined and, in particular, how traditional objectivismin Western philosophy itself constitutes just such a \"folk classifi-cation system.\" However, Lakoff also finds that the body is not atabula rasa upon which society can inscribe anything it wishes.Without attempting to distinguish between the social and biological"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"96  The Sense of Ritualexperiences of the body, he describes a preconceptual structuringof experience, which in turn structures the conceptual categorieswith which human beings think.123 In contrast therefore to Hertz,Mauss, Durkheim, and Douglas, for whom basic logical categoriesare social in nature and acquired in practice, Lakoff argues thatthey are fully rooted in the sociobiological body. The import of thisapproach, which echoes the thrust of V. Turner's argument, suggestsboth the primacy of the body over the abstraction 'society' and theirreducibility of the social body.In a third tradition, feminist scholarship has pioneered the rec-ognition of gender as a fundamental condition of experience andas an analytic category for specifically addressing the body's relationto language and identity, writing and power.124 From the early workof Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, who explored the traditionalidentification of literary creativity with phallocentric imagery,through the \"gynocriticism\" of Elaine Showalter, to the more rad-ical work of Helene Cixous, Julia Kristeva, and I'ecriture feminine—feminist literary theory has challenged traditional methods to focuson \"woman's lived experience\" at the center of which is \"theBody.\"125Within the ethos created by these three cross-fertilizing traditions,even relatively mainstream historians are now looking beyond thesocial construction of institutions to the construction of the 'socialbodies' that mandate such institutions.126 It appears we are nowreappropriating the image of the body: no longer the mere physicalinstrument of the mind, it now denotes a more complex and irre-ducible phenomenon, namely, the social person.Not surprisingly, the emergence of a focus on the social body hasentailed a close consideration of ritual. Indeed, any discussion ofthe social body presupposes some theory of how the human psy-chophysical entity is socialized and therein empowered as a culturalactor. Often a special appeal is made to ritual to 'model' this wholeprocess of socialization as the transformation of nature into culture.It is in this style that Burridge eloquently described how the ritualstructure of millenarian activities \"recapitulates the processwhereby an animal crossed the threshold to become man, andthrough which one sort of man becomes a new sort of man.\"127In a more complicated example, Foucault has correlated the var-ious \"rituals\" of penal discipline with \"economies of power\" and"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The Ritual Body  97changing constructions of the human person.128 For Foucault, the\"body\" emerged in the late seventeenth century as the arena inwhich more local social practices were linked to the larger scaleorganization of power. With examples that range from marking thebody with torture to confessional routines and the control of space,Foucault has suggested how \"rituals of power\" work to forge aspecific political \"technology\" of the body. As the medium of theplay of power, he argued, the body came to be linked to a newpolitical rationality specifically rooted in the technologies of \"bio-power.\"129 This historical emergence of the body as a focus, more-over, would constitute a new level of analysis located between bi-ology and the institutional vehicles of force, and giving rise to thehuman sciences themselves.130In a study of the Tshidi of South Africa, Jean Comaroff contraststhe ritual construction of personhood in precolonial ritual life withthe very different form of personhood ritually constructed in post-colonial Zionist churches. Comaroff argues that social practicesstructure the body, thereby constructing \"social beings\" via theinternalization of basic schemes and values. The socialized body inturn gives rise to dispositions that generate similarly, although notidentically, structured and structuring practices. Thus, she argues,the body \"mediates\" all action: it is the medium for the internali-zation and reproduction of social values and for the simultaneousconstitution of both the self and the world of social relations.131Bourdieu's analysis of these dynamics has been, perhaps, the mostdramatic. He argues that every social group \"entrusts to bodilyautomatisms\" those principles that are most basic to the organi-zation and maintenance of that group. Bourdieu goes further thanDouglas, who focused on ritual in terms of how the preservationof the group involves a drive to coordinate all levels of experienceand expression by correlating the body with society and the cos-mos.132 Bourdieu explores the mediation of the body via a \"dialecticof objectification and embodiment\" that makes it the locus for thecoordination of all levels of bodily, social, and cosmological ex-perience. This coordination is effected only in and through schemesthat pass \"from practice to practice\" without becoming expliciteither in personal consciousness or in social discourse.133Despite their differences, these studies constitute a general con-sensus that the distinctive strategies of ritual action play a major"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"98  The Sense of Ritualrole in the construction of the social body. Unfortunately, however,when discussing the ritual construction of the social body, Foucault,Comaroff, and Bourdieu all slide from a discussion of social prac-tices into a discussion of ritual ones with little if any explication ofthe implied relation of ritual practices to social practices in general.They appear to mean that ritual practices either 'model' social onesin an extreme way or that ritual practices are particular problem-addressing techniques. Nonetheless, their work provides a usefulbasis for describing ritualization as strategic social activity and so-cialization. In the following sections I will rely heavily on theirframework and terminology in working out the distinctive object-unity of ritualization as a strategic form of socialization.The Ritualized Body EnvironmentThe implicit dynamic and 'end' of ritualization—that which it doesnot see itself doing—can be said to be the production of a 'ritualizedbody.' A ritualized body is a body invested with a 'sense' of ritual.This sense of ritual exists as an implicit variety of schemes whosedeployment works to produce sociocultural situations that the ri-tualized body can dominate in some way. This is a \"practical mas-tery,\" to use Bourdieu's term, of strategic schemes for ritualization,and it appears as a social instinct for creating and manipulatingcontrasts. This 'sense' is not a matter of self-conscious knowledgeof any explicit rules of ritual but is an implicit \"cultivateddisposition.\"134Ritualization produces this ritualized body through the interac-tion of the body with a structured and structuring environment. \"Itis in the dialectical relationship between the body and a space struc-tured according to mythico-ritual oppositions,\" writes Bourdieu,\"that one finds the form par excellence of the structural appren-ticeship which leads to the em-bodying of the structures of theworld, that is, the appropriating by the world of a body thus enabledto appropriate the world.\"135 Hence, through a series of physicalmovements ritual practices spatially and temporally construct anenvironment organized according to schemes of privileged oppo-sition. The construction of this environment and the activities withinit simultaneously work to impress these schemes upon the bodies"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The Ritual Body  99of participants. This is a circular process that tends to be misre-cognized, if it is perceived at all, as values and experiences impressedupon the person and community from sources of power and orderbeyond it. Through the orchestration in time of loose but strate-gically organized oppositions, in which a few oppositions quietlycome to dominate others, the social body internalizes the principlesof the environment being delineated. Inscribed within the socialbody, these principles enable the ritualized person to generate inturn strategic schemes that can appropriate or dominate other so-ciocultural situations.The importance of the ritual environment has, of course, beenelaborated before. Since Arnold Van Gennep correlated spatial orgeographical progression with the ritual marking of cultural \"pas-sages,\" many others have developed the idea of \"ritual space\" invarious ways.136 Mircea Eliade, for example, found ritual insepa-rable from the delineation of a sacred place and the \"regeneration\"of time.137 V. Turner specifically discussed the creation of \"ritual-ized space.\"138 Jonathan Z. Smith focused on the ritual dynamicsof demarcating a \"controlled environment\"—to the point of sug-gesting the role of such places in generating the temporal realitiesof the ritual calendar itself.139 Yet a focus on the acts themselvesilluminates a critical circularity to the body's interaction with thisenvironment: generating it, it is molded by it in turn. By virtue ofthis circularity, space and time are redefined through the physicalmovements of bodies projecting organizing schemes on the space-time environment on the one hand while reabsorbing these schemesas the nature of reality on the other. In this process such schemesbecome socially instinctive automatisms of the body and implicitstrategies for shifting the power relationships among symbols.Adapting Bourdieu's discussion of practice, we can speak of thenatural logic of ritual, a logic embodied in the physical movementsof the body and thereby lodged beyond the grasp of consciousnessand articulation.140 The principles underlying this logic can bemade explicit only with great difficulty; they are rarely in themselvesthe objects of scrutiny or contention. And yet, suggests Bourdieu,nothing less than a whole cosmology is instilled with the words\"Stand up straight!\"141 Rappaport makes a similar point in de-scribing how the act of kneeling does not so much communicate amessage about subordination as it generates a body identified with"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"ioo  The Sense of Ritualsubordination.141 In other words, the molding of the body withina highly structured environment does not simply express innerstates. Rather, it primarily acts to restructure bodies in the verydoing of the acts themselves. Hence, required kneeling does notmerely communicate subordination to the kneeler. For all intentsand purposes, kneeling produces a subordinated kneeler in andthrough the act itself. On another level of the strategies of rituali-zation, such an act may in fact set up a bifurcation between theexternal show of subordination and an internal act of resistance.These more complex dimensions are explored in Part III. For now,what we see in ritualization is not the mere display of subjectivestates or corporate values. Rather, we see an act of production—the production of a ritualized agent able to wield physically ascheme of subordination or insubordination.The situational features of ritualization are not exhausted, how-ever, by this consideration of the centrality of the ritual body withina structured environment. The body is always conditioned by andresponsive to a specific context. John Blacking underscores thispoint when he argues that \"it is from a specific historical and ethicalcontext that the individual derives the expressive possibilities of hisbody.\"143 Hence, ritualization, as the production of a ritualizedagent via the interaction of a body within a structured and struc-turing environment, always takes place within a larger and veryimmediate sociocultural situation. Yet just as ritualization is nevermerely the expression of a subjective state, neither is it merely aspatiotemporal reflection of this larger situation or more encom-passing social structures. The relationship between any instance ofritualization and its immediate social and historical situation is, asnoted earlier, \"not one of reflected content but of a play offorms.\"144 Indeed, ritualization is the strategic manipulation of 'con-text' in the very act of reproducing it. The distinct strategy ofritualization in manipulating its situation will be broken down fur-ther in the following chapters. The point to make here is that ri-tualization cannot be understood apart from the immediatesituation, which is being reproduced in a misrecognized and trans-formed way through the production of ritualized agents.The opposite view, emphasizing the inherent autonomy of ritualactivity and its independence vis-a-vis its context, tends to beadopted by those trying to assess the more complex ritual traditions"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The Ritual Body  101such as the Catholic mass or the Vedic fire sacrifice. They see ritualas a matter of the exact performance of actions mandated by theauthority of history and the sacred. Rappaport, for example, findsthat \"liturgical orders,\" by which he means codified ritual traditionssuch as found in the Christian mass or the Jewish sabbath, do notreflect the social-political-ecological relations of their immediatecontext.145 Yet if we take seriously the idea that even the exactrepetition of an age-old ritual precedent is a strategic act with whichto define the present, then no ritual style is autonomous. We needtools with which to analyze the particular play of forms of a stylethat purports to be autonomous.Ritual Oppositions and HierarchiesThe main strategies of ritualization noted thus far—the generationof a privileged opposition between ritualized and other activitiesand the production of ritualized agents through the generation ofa structured environment experienced as molding the bodies actingwithin it—appear to involve certain basic dynamics. I will focuson three operations: first, the physical construction of schemes ofbinary oppositions; second, the orchestrated hierarchization ofthese schemes whereby some schemes come to dominate or nuanceothers; and third, the generation of a loosely integrated whole inwhich each element 'defers' to another in an endlessly circular chainof reference. In this semantic universe, every sign is an implicit setof contrasts and every contrast invokes another. Yet despite thecontinued juxtaposition of nearly equivalent oppositions, the con-trasts are orchestrated so that some come to appropriate, reinter-pret, or qualify others. On the one hand, the semantic system evokedis a closed and endlessly self-deferring circular system; on the otherhand, the hierarchical orchestration of the contrasts and deferralsgenerates the sense of a universal totality, a unified and authoritativecoherence informing the whole scheme of things.Returning briefly to the example of the traditional Catholic eu-charistic meal, whole sets of oppositions emerge to dominate othersets. The scheme of a central or 'centered' community versus adispersed population is generated as people congregate together,coming from different directions and situations to assemble at a"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Sense of Ritualspecific place and time. When they are gathered, this scheme isoverlaid with a higher versus lower opposition in which a raisedaltar and elevated host, the lifting and lowering voices and eyes, aswell as sequences of standing and kneeling, and so on, all generatea contrast between a higher reality (spiritual) and a lower one(mundane). However, this scheme is overlaid in turn by an innerversus outer one when the higher reality is internalized through thefood shared by participants. Ultimately, the inner-outer schemecomes to dominate the oppositions of higher-lower and centered—dispersed, generating an experience of a higher spiritual authorityas an internalized reality.146The importance of oppositions and contrasts in ritual has beenapparent since Durkheim's study of ritual's relation to the demar-cation of the sacred from the profane. Likewise, a small but criticaltwist of perspective has suggested that ritual is less concerned todefine and proclaim sacrality than it is to assert the contrast betweensacred and profane. As J. Z. Smith notes, \"Ritual is, above all, anassertion of difference.\"147 G. Bateson came to the same conclusionin his early study of the naven ceremonies of the latmul of NewGuinea. He saw these ceremonies as asserting difference, and hecoined the term \"schismogenesis\" to denote the differentiationseffected in ritual, where they are also balanced by other processesof integration.148 Levi-Strauss also argued for a \"unifying\" functionin ritual that is nevertheless effected through the obsessive ritualprocess of making countless minute distinctions he termed\"parceling.\"149In practice, however, ritual contrasts are rarely as balanced asthese theories suggest. Binary oppositions almost always involveasymmetrical relations of dominance and subordination by whichthey generate hierarchically organized relationships. Hertz, V.Turner, and Bourdieu have all traced the asymmetrical oppositionsthat create dominance, hierarchy, and integration among a systemof associations. Hertz was the first to describe how the deceptivelystraightforward oppositions of the body, such as right and left,promoted and rationalized the dominance of the right hand and itsanalogy in countless homologous contrasts. His insights have beenextended by the work of Terence Turner in particular, who arguesthat formulations of binary oppositions are an elementary meansIOZ"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Ritual Body  103of expressing unity and totality through an implicit hierarchy.150Expanding Louis Dumont's work on how the hierarchical castesystem of India is rooted in an opposition of purity and pollution,T. Turner concludes that the ritual process of differentiation issimultaneously a process of generating a hierarchical form of un-ity.151 Bourdieu likewise describes hierarchization as a strategy of\"integration in and through division.\"151Hertz, V. Turner, and Bourdieu have also remarked upon themanner in which one set of oppositions comes to be related toanother set: right-left is analogized to inside-outside or good-evil,while male-female is linked to right-left, front-back, and so on.These relationships both generate and presuppose complex chainsof associations and taxonomic relations.153 Leach and Tambiahexplored a similar 'logic' in their appeal to the operations of 'met-aphor' and 'metonomy,' which establish relationships between suchspheres of reference as one's stomach and one's house or pregnancyand gardening.154 In addition, Brian K. Smith's discussion of cor-relation and resemblance in Vedic ritual presents yet another logicby which the transfer of taxonomic schemes defines relationshipsamong every element of the rite and the cosmos.155Bourdieu, in particular, delineates a type of \"practical logic\" inritual activities that involves three fundamental operations: (i) pos-iting an initial opposition based upon a fundamental dichotomy;(2.) applying different symbolic schemes to a single object or practice(e.g., a girl undergoing initiation will engage in a series of activitiesorganized around such schemes as opening-closing or swelling-shrinking); and (3) applying a single symbolic scheme to differentlogical universes (e.g., as a world in its own right, a native housemay be considered to have male and female parts, but in the contextof the whole world outside the house, it will be considered female).Through these operations whole systems of ritual symbols and ac-tions can be generated by means of a small number of oppositions(male-female, within-without) or reduced to a few pairs that ap-pear fundamental—and they all prove to be based on the move-ments and postures of the body.156 In addition to the many formsthat the basic opposition may take, certain forms tend to act as\"switchers\" to establish relationships between various homologizedactivities. For example, 'inside—outside' will come between, and"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"104  The Sense of Ritualserve to link, 'behind—in front' with 'female fertility—male virility.'Thus, for Bourdieu, the practical logic of ritual is simultaneouslylogical and biological—or, as Lakoff would argue, \"embodied.\"157This ritual logic is a minimalist logic that generates a 'sense' oflogical systematicity while simultaneously facilitating subtle shiftsin the ability of some symbols to dominate others. Most important,however, it is by means of these operations that ordinary physicalmovements generate homologies and hierarchies among diverse lev-els and areas of experience, setting up relations among symbols,values, and social categories. Homologous oppositions (light-dark,good—evil, male—female) can organize taxonomic sets (the set oflight, good, and male, or the set of dark, evil, and female) simplyby the juxtaposition of activities that use these oppositions. In actualpractice only a few elements from a 'set' need be invoked to implya whole series of relationships and implications. Such homologizedspheres are orchestrated (or confused, or collapsed) so as to producean experience of their basic identity or coherence.158 This experienceof coherence, however, simultaneously facilitates the emergence ofsome symbolic terms in a dominant relation to others. The senseof the general identity of the whole naturalizes such hegemony. Thisis the heart of the not-seeing, the oversight, of ritualization.In sum, ritualization not only involves the setting up of opposi-tions, but through the privileging built into such an exercise itgenerates hierarchical schemes to produce a loose sense of totalityand systematicity. In this way, ritual dynamics afford an experienceof 'order' as well as the 'fit' between this taxonomic order and thereal world of experience.Internal-External Strategies of RitualizationThe organization of oppositions into hierarchical schemes does notimply the ritual resolution of these oppositions. The type of rein-tegration effected by hierarchization is based on maintaining andmultiplying oppositions. Poststructural linguistics provides somehelp in seeing how this works. Derrida's critique of structuralism,for example, gave a very different interpretation to the dynamicsof binary opposition. Instead of a series of atemporal structuraloppositions in which meaning is produced either through the mutual"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Ritual Body  105definition of two terms or through their mediation by a third term,Derrida describes a process of difference. This is a process of \"freeplay\" in which the drawing of distinctions endlessly defers signi-fication, meaning, and reference from the present signifier to a po-tentially infinite number of signifiers. Not only is 'meaning' neverarrived at; it is never present in any sense at all.159 However, insuch a system of endless deferral of reference, meaning may neverbe given but is always implied.The open-ended \"transcoding\" or \"rhetoric\" of endless differencelaid out by Derrida is basically at odds with the notion of a fun-damental contradiction and the ensuing dialectic that comprise aMarxist style of analysis. Of course a contrast between rhetoric anddialectic dates back to the tensions in ancient Athens between therhetoric of the Greek Sophists and the dialectic of the Socraticdialogues.160 More recently, however, such critics of the dialecticas Friedrich Nietzsche and Foucault have attempted to redress itsdominance in history and undermine its claims to embody logicalreasoning, to reveal meaning, and to ground knowledge. Foucault'scritique of the Hegelian dialectic, for example, explicitly challengeshow it has served to \"organize the play of affirmations and nega-tions, establish the legitimacy of resemblances within representa-tion, and guarantee the objectivity and operation of concepts.\"161Ultimately, a Derridean and rhetorical notion of difference wouldlead an analysis of ritualization in a direction quite different fromone that relies on a fundamental conflict and a dialectic ofresolution.Derrida has proposed a \"grammatology,\" or science of signifi-cation, whereby signification rests upon the play of differencesamong related elements. It is clear that ritalization also involves aplay of differences. The body produces an environment structuredaccording to a series of privileged oppositions, which in turn is seento mold and produce a ritualized agent. However, the interactionof body and environment involves a deferral of signification that isnot completed or resolved even in the emergence of the ritualizedagent. On the contrary, the process of signification is deferred be-yond the rite itself, as it must be, into the world at large. Throughthe production of series of oppositions and the orchestration ofthese series into dominant and latent schemes, ritualization doesnot resolve a social contradiction. Rather it catches up into itself"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"io6  The Sense of Ritualall the experienced and conventional conflicts and oppositions ofsocial life, juxtaposing and homologizing them into a loose andprovisional systematicity. These contraries receive nuances or sig-nification (as male and female will receive the nuancing of rightand left) and they defer signification (as female and male nuancethe opposition of lowly and mighty). In practice this rhetoricaldisplacement wraps around beyond anyone's ability to follow itfully as the oppositions gradually produce a hierarchical coopta-tion—as when male-female, deferring to right-left, is then takenup into strong-weak, outward-inward, body-soul. A 'structure'can be said to exist only by freezing or denying this temporal or-chestration. Moreover, this orchestrated deferral of significationnever yields a definitive answer, a final meaning, or a single act—there is no point of arrival but a constant invocation of new termsto continue the validation and coherence of the older terms. Thisprocess yields the sense of a loosely knit and loosely coherent to-tality, the full potential of which is never fully grasped and thusnever fully subject to challenge or denial. One is never confrontedwith 'the meaning' to accept or reject; one is always led into aredundant, circular, and rhetorical universe of values and termswhose significance keeps flowing into other values and terms.Yet ritualization does not embrace the lived tensions and valuesof social life as just one set of terms among others in its taxonomicelaborations. Rather, as the very drawing of a privileged opposi-tion—which differentiates by opposing and unites by dominating—ritualization subjects these tensions, terms, and social bodies to achange in status, or problematic. People do not take a social prob-lem to ritual for a solution. People generate a ritualized environmentthat acts to shift the very status and nature of the problem intoterms that are endlessly retranslated in strings of deferred schemes.The multiplication and orchestration of such schemes do not pro-duce a resolution; rather, they afford a translation of immediateconcerns into the dominant terms of the ritual. The orchestrationof schemes implies a resolution without ever defining one.What we might call the 'external strategy' of ritualization, thevery drawing of a privileged distinction between its activities andothers, parallels what can be called its 'internal strategy,' the gen-eration of schemes of opposition, hierarchization, and deferral bywhich the body has impressed upon it the schemes that effect the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Ritual Body  107distinctive privileging and differentiation of ritualizing acts them-selves. This manner of producing a ritualized agent, as I will arguenext, can be seen to be the basic and distinctive strategy of so-calledritual behavior.Ritual MasteryThe specific strategies of ritualization come together in the pro-duction of a ritualized social body, a body with the ability to deployin the wider social context the schemes internalized in the ritualizedenvironment. The ritualized social body, therefore, is one that comesto possess, to various degrees, a cultural 'sense of ritual.' It is nec-essary to explore the practical workings of this sense of ritual inorder to come to any conclusions about the distinctiveness of ri-tualization as practice.Bourdieu speaks of \"practical mastery\" to indicate the systemsof classifying schemes that act as instruments for ordering the worldthat \"every successfully socialized agent\" possesses.I6z Theseschemes of practical mastery are acquired through the interactionof the body with a structured environment. They come to be embed-ded in the very perceptions and dispositions of the body and henceare known only in practice as the way things are done.163 I use theterm 'ritual mastery' to designate a practical mastery of the schemesof ritualization as an embodied knowing, as the sense of ritual seenin its exercise. Aside from the issue of institutionally recognizedritual experts, which will be considered in the next chapter, ritualmastery can be distinguished from Bourdieu's practical mastery onlyprovisionally, since a cultural sense of ritual cannot be isolated fromthe other senses of the socialized person. This said, ritual masteryremains a useful term for this analysis in several ways. Most simply,it is a corrective to the habit of thinking about ritual as an existingentity of some sort. Ritual mastery implies that ritual can exist onlyin the specific cultural schemes and strategies for ritualization (i.e.,for the production of 'ritualized' practices) embodied and acceptedby persons of specific cultural communities. Ritual mastery alsoindicates something of the 'work' of ritualization, specifically, theproduction of a ritualized social agent in whose body lies theschemes by which to shift the organization or significance of many"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"io8  The Sense of Ritualother culturally possible situations. The term should convey aninherently circular phenomenon: the purpose of ritualization is toritualize persons, who deploy schemes of ritualization in order todominate (shift or nuance) other, nonritualized situations to renderthem more coherent with the values of the ritualizing schemes andcapable of molding perceptions. Ritualization and ritual masteryare not only circular; they are also an exercise in the endless deferralof meaning and purpose. The effectiveness of exercising ritual mas-tery as strategic practice lies precisely in this circularity and deferral.The following sections attempt to explore several dimensions ofthis circularity and deferral.Seeing and Not SeeingAccording to our Althusserian model, ritual practices are producedwith an intent to order, rectify, or transform a particular situation.Ritualized agents would see these purposes. They would not seewhat they actually do in ritually ordering, rectifying, or transform-ing the situation. Foucault implies a similar principle when he notesthat people know what they do and they know why they do whatthey do, but they do not know what what they are doing does.164For Althusser, this constitutes the intrinsic \"blindness\" of practice.For our purposes, it is a strategic 'misrecognition' of the relationshipof one's ends and means.The 'blindness' or 'misrecognition' discussed here should be dif-ferentiated from a longstanding tendency toward mystification inthe study of ritual in either of two senses: mystifying the phenom-enon of ritual or seeing mystification as essential to what ritualdoes. Whereas theological perspectives tend toward the former,social scientific perspectives tend toward the latter. Marxists com-bine both by ascribing to ritual an inherent fuzziness that makes itsuitable for ideological mystification.165 Even Rappaport's ecolog-ical rationalism succumbs to mystification in some concluding re-marks about the study of ritual: \"We are confronted, finally, witha remarkable spectacle. The unfalsifiable supported by the unden-iable yields the unquestionable, which transforms the dubious, thearbitrary, and the conventional into the correct, the necessary, and"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The Ritual Body  109the natural. This structure is, I would suggest, the foundation uponwhich the human way of life stands, and it is realized in ritual.\"166One might conclude that many theories of ritual argue for theimportance of what ritual does by making it as broadly encom-passing, important, and mysterious as possible. Nonetheless, withsome consistency, ambiguity has also been systematically identifiedas an important aspect of ritual.167 Lewis, for example, argues thatritual may emphasize the ambiguity or incoherence of symbols inorder to invite speculation or a perception of \"a mystery that seemsto come within grasp.\"168 Valerio Valeri suggests that ritual is muchmore ambiguous and poetic than linguistic communication sinceits \"grammar\" stresses paradigmatic over syntagmatic relations.169David Jordan and Fernandez independently explored the ways inwhich ritual symbols are inherently ambiguous, thereby affordingthe diverse and nonfalsifiable interpretations they find necessary tothe maintenance of community.170These examples suggest that some type of ambiguity or blindnessin ritualization is linked to its distinctive efficacy. To pursue thisissue more systematically, the Althusserian model would have uspose two questions: first, what does ritualization see and, in seeingit, what does it not see; second, what is the relationship betweenits seeing and its not-seeing—that is, what is the object-unity ofritualization as practice?What does ritualization see? It is a way of acting that sees itselfas responding to a place, event, force, problem, or tradition. It tendsto see itself as the natural or appropriate thing to do in the circum-stances. Ritualization does not see how it actively creates place,force, event, and tradition, how it redefines or generates the cir-cumstances to which it is responding. It does not see how its ownactions reorder and reinterpret the circumstances so as to affordthe sense of a fit among the main spheres of experience—body,community, and cosmos.Ritualization sees its end, the rectification of a problematic. Itdoes not see what it does in the process of realizing this end, itstransformation of the problematic itself. And yet what ritualizationdoes is actually quite simple: it temporally structures a space-timeenvironment through a series of physical movements (using schemesdescribed earlier), thereby producing an arena which, by its molding"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"i io  The Sense of Ritualof the actors, both validates and extends the schemes they are in-ternalizing. Indeed, in seeing itself as responding to an environment,ritualization interprets its own schemes as impressed upon the actorsfrom a more authoritative source, usually from well beyond theimmediate human community itself. Hence, through an orchestra-tion in time of loosely and effectively homologized oppositions inwhich some gradually come to dominate others, the social bodyreproduces itself in the image of the symbolically schematized en-vironment that has been simultaneously established.As Burridge describes it, ritualization sees the goal of a newperson. It does not see how it produces that person—how it projectsan environment that, reembodied, produces a renuanced personfreshly armed with schemes of strategic reclassification. The com-plex and multifarious details of ritual, most of which must be donejust so, are seen as appropriate demands or legitimate tradition.They are not seen as arbitrary producers of distinctions. Rituali-zation sees the qualities of the new person who should emerge; itdoes not see the schemes of privileged opposition, hierarchization,and circular deferment by which ritualized agents produce ritualizedagents empowered or disempowered by strategic schemes of prac-tice. Ritualization sees the evocation of a consensus on values, sym-bols, and behavior that is the end of ritualization. It does not seethe way in which the hegemonic social order is appropriated as aredemptive process and reproduced individually through communalparticipation in the physical orchestration of a variety of taxonomicschemes.171Ritual and LanguageInterpretation of the seeing and not-seeing of ritualization is closelylinked to interpretation of the communicative function of ritual—an issue around which some controversy has accumulated. Whenviewed as a form of practice, chosen for its strategic qualites, itbecomes more readily apparent that rites take place specifically inlieu of explicit logical speculation.171 Ritual practices never defineanything except in terms of the expedient relationships that ritual-ization itself establishes among things, thereby manipulating themeaning of things by manipulating their relationships.173 For Levi-"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The Ritual Body  111Strauss among others, what is distinctive about ritual is not whatit says or symbolizes, but that first and foremost it does things:ritual is always a matter of \"the performance of gestures and themanipulation of objects.\"174 Hence, ritualization is simultaneouslythe avoidance of explicit speech and narrative.Two issues are involved and often collapsed in any considerationof ritual and language: first, the ritual use of language; and second,the comparison of ritual as a language to verbal or textual lan-guages, in the sense that its activities parallel the communicativefunctions of the latter.It has been argued that in ritual words themselves are deedsthat accomplish things. This position was pioneered by men likeFrazer and Malinowski, who understood most ritual as magicbecause it assumed an identify between the word and the thing.More recently, Tambiah argued that the notion of ritual lan-guage as magical in a causal sense can be retired without losingthe importance of words to ritual activity. From his perspective,the distinctive communications of ritual language are not somesecondary dimension to the work of ritual but are central towhat ritual is.175Tambiah shares with many other ritual theorists a concern toshow how ritual communication is not just an alternative wayof expressing something but the expression of things that can-not be expressed in any other way.176 Yet this shared concernhas led theorists to widely dissimilar conclusions: that ritual isless ambiguous (i.e., more precise and effective) than ordinarylanguage; that ritual is more ambiguous than ordinary language;and that the development of sophisticated verbal communica-tion actually obliterates the vestigial need for ritual communi-cation.177Some have attempted to show that ritual communicates by'modeling': strictly speaking, it does not send messages but cre-ates situations.178 For Valeri, these situations supply the oppor-tunity to infer and master the codes underlying the ostensibleactivity of the rite. It is a matter of programmed learning thatinvolves the perception and reproduction of concepts or princi-ples.179 For Tambiah, however, the situations modeled in ritualact either like \"signals,\" which evoke certain responses, or like\"signs,\" which can explain other activities in the same way that"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Sense of Rituala blueprint can explain a house or the building of a house.180Other formulations have ritual communicate by affording expe-riences in which underlying cultural premises are verified andcultural dispositions are reinforced.Not only has there been criticism of the effort to analyze rit-ual as a language per se; there has also been criticism of the at-tempt to analyze ritual as communicative in any sense at all.181Bourdieu, who is particularly insistent on this last point, avoidsevery semblance of literary or verbal analysis. He eschews, forexample, all use of the terms metaphor, metonomy, and analogyin describing the operations of ritual practice. Practice qua prac-tice, he insists, remains on the \"hither side of discourse,\" andthat is precisely the key to how it does what it does.l8z Eventhose rites that are just a practical mimesis of the natural processto be facilitated are not at all like metaphor or analogy simplybecause they are not nearly as explicit. Ritual practice as such isalways much fuzzier, avoiding the distinctive change in state thatoccurs when things are brought to the level of explicit dis-course.183 Relatively recent evidence for the existence of nonpro-positional schemes and the manner in which they work togenerate a social form of consensual meaning may provide moresupport for Bourdieu's position.184Certainly ritualization makes ample use of words in prayers,vows, recitations, speeches, songs, and the like. Sometimes thewords are considered by those involved to be the most criticalelements. Rappaport notes that for thirteenth-century William ofAuxerre, it is the words themselves in the ritual of the Christianmass that turn physical matter into the sacrament of the body ofChrist.185 Evidence indicates, however, that this is a historicallydefined phenomenon: the words of consecration were formally el-evated to this critical position in the Roman rite standardized bythe Council of Trent in 1570 and, significantly, in conjunction withthe formulation of the doctrine of transubstantiation and the en-hanced sacramental power of the ordained priest. In the eucharisticmeals of the early Church, on the other hand, the words were oflittle significance. The emphasis within those rites was on the doingof certain actions, specifically those thought to have been donebefore by Christ himself.186Even the briefest contrast of these two historical rites, regarded112"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Ritual Body  113by the Roman church as one and the same liturgical tradition,reveals how strategic the use of language can be. Whereas the useof language or a particular mode of speaking does not appear tobe intrinsically necessary to ritual as such, the opposite does hold—namely, that ritualization readily affects the way language is usedand the significance it is accorded.187Propositions and formulations occur in many rituals and theymay even be the most critical moment, as in the Roman rite's wordsof transubstantiation or \"I do\" when one is sworn to tell the truthin a court of law. Verbal formulations with the same performativeforce can be found even in cultures reputed to be less \"logocentric.\"Yet these formulations themselves do not open a discourse withinthe rite about what the ritual is doing. They are, in the full senseintended by Austin, performative in their particular context; theyare not explicit narrative discourse.188The deconstructive enterprises of Derrida and DeMan have ex-plored nonpropositional meanings and the rhetorical role of met-aphorical images in structuring texts. Derrida, as we have seen,points to the endless deferral of meaning both within the text andwithin the act of interpreting, or transcoding, the text. DeMan,however, calls attention to how deconstruction of the metaphorsand tropes structuring the text and thick description of their deferralof signification does not, in the end, begin to grasp the ways inwhich the text continues to resist reduction to these devices. Saidhas given this \"resistance\" a name, calling it \"the practical world-liness of the text.\" He describes this worldiness as a dimension oftextuality beyond the free play of grammatology. The practicalworldliness of the text is not simply the sociohistorical context ofthe work or any type of irreducible essence within the work. Thepractical worldliness of a text is its own practice of the strategiesof social action inherent in texts and textualization. Echoing Der-rida, Said argues that the text specifically hides how it, in the formof a text, participates in a network of power: \"A text is not a textunless it hides from the first comer, from the first glance, the lawof its composition and the rules of its game.\"189 Again, these lawsand rules are not some inaccessible secret within the text but ac-company the text as a strategic form of cultural signification andpractice.This example of the resistant text is useful in attempting to ex-"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"ii4  The Sense of Ritualplicate the strategies of ritualization. These strategies will inevitablyelude full articulation simply by virtue of the fact that full articu-lation is not a medium that can grasp them. That is to say, withinthe medium of formally explicit discourse, there is nothing there tograsp, just a variety of culturally instinctive and flexible schemeswith which to avoid and undermine everything but the ritual actsthemselves.Redemptive Hegemony and MisrecognitionThe relationship between the seeing and the not-seeing of ritualmastery constitutes the particular object-unity of ritualization as astrategic mode of practice. A more familiar example, drawn fromtheoretical practice, may act as a useful introduction to the notionof an object-unity to ritual practices. Certainly the principles ofpractice addressed earlier in this chapter can readily be seen tofunction in the practice of theory as well as ritual. For example,Chapter i began by focusing on the strategy of a privileged op-position between thought and action as well as the misrecognitionthat enables a discourse to identify object, method, and experts asone interdependent and interlegitimizing whole. In the relationshipbetween what theoretical practice sees itself doing and what it doesnot see (the object-unity of theoretical discourse), one finds theproduction of systematic and seemingly independent bodies ofknowledge. These bodies of knowledge act simultaneously to securea particular form of authority, a particular autonomous reality forstudy, and some degree of free competition for access to masteryof theoretical practice. Theorists see the goal of knowledge and thework of research; they do not see the production of a discoursewith its objects, subjects, and methods. Nor, as many have de-scribed, do they see how this discourse manipulates its own contextof power relations. Through appeals to the objectivity attendingindependent fields of study, such a discourse wins a dominant po-sition by virtue of contrasting itself with more overtly political orcoercive practices.Ritual mastery, like the culturally defined mastery of theoricalpractice, reveals a specific object-unity characteristic of ritualizationas a particular mode of practice. Specifically, its relationship of"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Ritual Body  115seeing to not-seeing is the production of agents embodying a senseof ritual constituted by and expressed in particular schemes of ri-tualization. These schemes act as instruments for knowing and ap-propriating the world. The deployment of these schemes bothstructures experience of the world and molds dispositions that areeffective in the world so experienced. These structured and struc-turing experiences of the world appear to guarantee the reality andvalue of their underlying schemes by means of the sense of fit orcoherence between the instincts of the socialized body and the en-vironment in which it acts. And yet ritualization does not simplyact, unseeingly, to bring the social body, the community, and thelargest image of reality into some reassuring configuration of co-herent continuity. More fundamentally, it also appropriates thiscoherence in terms of the interests of persons or groups. The co-herence is rendered and experienced as redemptive for those em-powered by the schemes of the ritual.The distinctive strategies of practices of ritualization—their ob-ject-unity, aporia, blindness and insight, mastery and misrecogni-tion—must lie beyond the reach of a logical theoretical articulation.The frustration of theorists attempting to grasp the principle of thisefficacy is evident in Maurice Bloch's exasperated wail: \"How doesritual actually do what we say it does?\"190 Bloch pushes this ques-tion, pointing out, for example, that despite the dominance andendurance of Durkheim's analysis of ritual there is still no expla-nation of how ritual makes collective representations come to ap-pear as external to the individual.191 He similarly critiques Geertz'sdescription of the poetics of power in the Balinese negara, arguingthat Geertz never really explains why the ritual has the power withwhich he credits it.I9i Bloch himself contributes two valuable an-swers, \"formalization\" in one context and the interrelationship oflocal and central rites in another context.193 His answers point toimportant strategies of ritualization but not to their distinctive ob-ject-unity. Nor does Bloch's rather functional question (\"How doesritual do what we say it does?\") adequately allow for the natureof practice. We might better ask, How is it that ritual activities areseen or judged to be the appropriate thing to do? This secondquestion gets closer to the dynamics of the 'sense of ritual' and thechoice of ritualization strategies over other ways of acting in a givensituation."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"116  The Sense of RitualNonetheless, using the approach to ritual gradually developedin this chapter, Bloch's question can be answered in part. Ritualdoes what it does through the privileged differentiations and de-ferred resolutions by which the ritualized body structures an en-vironment, an environment that in turn impresses its highlynuanced structure on the bodies of those involved in the rite.Strategies, signification, and the experience of meaningfulness arefound in the endless circularity of the references mobilized, dur-ing the course of which some differentiations come to dominateothers. Ritual mastery is the ability—not equally shared, desired,or recognized—to (i) take and remake schemes from the sharedculture that can strategically nuance, privilege, or transform, (2.)deploy them in the formulation of a privileged ritual experience,which in turn (3) impresses them in a new form upon agentsable to deploy them in a variety of circumstances beyond the cir-cumference of the rite itself.In response to the revised question asked above, it can be saidthat ritualization is perceived to be the most effective type of actionto take in two overlapping circumstances: first, when the relation-ships of power being negotiated are based not on direct claims buton indirect claims of power conferred; and second, when the he-gemonic order being experienced must be rendered socially re-demptive in order to be personally redemptive. For example,ritualization is the way to construct power relations when the poweris claimed to be from God, not from military might or economicsuperiority; it is also the way for people to experience a vision ofa community order that is personally empowering.To complete this description of ritualization as a cultural sixth'sense' for the production of schemes that afford the forging of anexperience of redemptive hegemony, it is necessary to explore notthe actual contexts of ritualization—that would be a matter ofspecific cultural communities in history—but at least a more ac-curate if abstract scope for ritualization, namely, the context ofhistorical traditions and spatiotemporal ritual systems. Few prac-tices of ritualization are effective outside such contexts. While in-dispensable as context for any act of ritualization, such traditionsand systems of ritualized practices are secondary in an analyticalsense, since they are themselves constituted by the further play ofthe strategies of ritualization already discussed. Nonetheless, most"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Ritual Body  117ritual activity not only plays off contrasts with nonritualized be-havior; it also plays off other forms and instances of ritual activity.Thus, the \"ritualized ritual\" that Douglas sees as defining traditionis a strategic systemization of ritual schemes to afford a privilegeddifferentiation of whole institutions and bodies of activities.194"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"6Ritual Traditions and SystemsRitualization invokes dynamics of contrast with other forms ofcultural activity and, inevitably, with other ritualized acts as well.Indeed, one cannot adequately portray the full dynamics of ritual-ization except in the larger context of ritual traditions and systems.Several interrelated dimensions of this context can be provisionallydistinguished: first, a historical dimension in the sense of tradition-ally ritualized activities thought to have been handed down fromprevious generations; second, territorial and calendrical dimensionsthat include annual cycles of regional ritual activities involving over-lapping groups from the domestic to the national; and third, anorganizational dimension provided by the presence of ritual experts,their standardization of ritual activities, codification of texts, andelaboration of a discourse on ritual.The Construction of TraditionMany theoretical approaches to the notion of 'tradition,' particu-larly in relation to ritual activities, are structured around the familiarproblem of continuity and change. Clearly some things remain suf-ficiently consistent over time to give people a sense of continuitywith what are believed to be precedents; but it is equally clear thattraditions change in structure, details, and interpretation and suchchanges are not always fully recognized by those who live them.Many scholars designate as 'tradition' that which does not change;others attempt to combine change and continuity within the notion118"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Ritual Traditions and Systems 119of tradition. Taking the latter position, Paul Mus, Tambiah, and J.C. Heesterman have all advanced an understanding of tradition asconstituted by a paradox, an \"inner conflict\" so to speak, betweenan ideal atemporal order (unchanging structure) on the one handand the profane world of temporal change and compromise (chang-ing history) on the other. Heesterman, for one, identifies the Vedicsacrifice as the ideal and perfect order of ritual, represented by thebrahmin. The brahmin is inevitably locked in struggle with the king,who represents the less than ideal order of the temporal world.Each is differentiated from but dependent upon the other.195 How-ever, it is hard to see how this analysis of tradition amounts tomore than an impressive literary and interpretive device by whichtheory creates a dialectic of categories by means of which, in thiscase, structure consistently appropriates history.Hobsbawn and Terence Ranger also explore the ramifications oftradition as a set of fixed activities and values inherited from thepast and scrupulously preserved. But they specifically distinguishtradition from 'custom.' Custom, associated with oral cultures, re-mains inherently flexible and pragmatic, whereas tradition, by vir-tue of the role of written records, is a matter of invariant and oftenimpractical routines and conventions.196 In the spirit of Goody'sresearch on orality and literacy, Hobsbawn and Ranger point tothe importance of literacy to any notion of unchanging traditionas well as to the value given 'fixity' as a form of legitimation. \"Thepastness of the past,\" Goody and Ian Watt state, \"... depends upona historical sensibility which can hardly begin to operate withoutpermanent written records.\"197 Similarly, the traditional Westerndistinction between law and custom is one that arises when literacyleads to the distinct fixity of law in contrast to the inherent flexibilityof custom—as in ritual, myth, and oratory—in oral cultures.198Rappaport implicitly rejects the typology of literate/tradition andoral/custom. On the one hand it is obvious that literate societieswith fixed traditions of law also possess customs transmitted orally.On the other hand, Rappaport argues, even in oral cultures everyrite contains some percentage of traditional or unchanging material.He distinguishes these \"canonical messages,\" as he calls them,which derive from the past and do not refer to the current situationin any way, from \"indexical\" elements, which are shaped by thecurrent context of the rite. Some activities will be primarily can-"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"12.0  The Sense of Ritualonical while others will be primarily indexical, yet every ritual, heargues, by virtue of being a ritual, contains both indexical andcanonical elements.1\" In a similar way, Valeri notes the necessityof a \"fixed text\" (langue) within the ritual activities of tribal culturesas a means by which to establish the authority of a performance.Any ritual performance must be seen as based on and legitimizedby the \"superior authority\" of this very fixity. In oral societies theaudience acts as guardians of this superior authority, holding thepower to judge a ritual performance and validate its relation to thepast and the present. \"If the ritual had no fixed text, if it were notlaw, then authority could not be acquired or denied by virtue ofthe performance of ritual.\"*00Although these arguments specify slightly different relationshipsbetween ritual and fixed tradition, they represent some consensuson two points: first, ritual may be the more fixed expression of awritten tradition or the more adaptable expression of flexible cus-tom; second, within itself ritual may also encompass fixed activitiesas well as acts that reflect changing circumstances. Yet Rappaport'sand Valeri's conclusions tend to miss the way in which ritualizationactually constructs either fixed traditions or flexible customs—something that Hobsbawn and Ranger explicitly attempt to de-scribe. They look at how ritual \"invents\" tradition in order to afforda sense of legitimized continuity with the past and to experiencetradition as fixed/01 In the fixity of ritual's structure lies the prestigeof tradition and in this prestige lies its power. This type of processis one that P. Steven Sangren finds to be nothing less than the\"cultural construction of history.\"Z02In his studies of tribal oratory as a form of \"social control,\"Bloch closely analyzes the ritual construction of tradition. He spe-cifically delineates a process of \"formalization\" that differentiatesoratory from more routine ways of communicating/03 This processof formalization distinguishes some communication by invoking ahighly restricted code that purports to be the way the ancestorsspoke. As a way of speaking, formalization effectively determinescontent, transforming the specific into the general terms of a naturaland eternally preexisting order. For Bloch formalization not onlyproduces and maintains tradition; it simultaneously produces aform of authority, \"traditional authority,\" rooted in the appeal tothe past. The efficacy of formalization is due in part to the fact that"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Ritual Traditions and Systems  12.1it is an intangible form of power. For example, the restrictions onspeech and movement that produce formalization are relatively in-discernible as devices, and it is even less obvious that they determinecontent. Bloch also demonstrates how the formalization of speechcan subtly induce a general compliance with what is going on: likethe control wielded by the conventions of politeness, formality putspeople in a situation that discourages challenge and compels ac-ceptance. \"If you have allowed someone to speak in an oratoricalmanner\" in a Merina village council meeting, Bloch notes, \"youhave practically accepted his proposal.\" The burden of social con-trol in all societies, he concludes, is borne by the norms of politebehavior/04Yet the effectiveness of formalization as a means of social controlis offset by its own built-in constraints. For example, a speaker isvery restricted in what he or she can address and say. Often a looserstyle of speaking must be recognized in order to actually work outreal problems, even though its authority is far less than that of thetighter code of formalized speech. Hence, as a strategy of socialcontrol, formalization promotes a fairly powerful but constrainedvoice of authority, one that must in turn delegate authority to lesservoices/05 In addition, to maintain the authority and prestige offormalized functions there must be restricted access to the necessaryskills or training, requiring primarily oral transmission with nowritten materials to facilitate indiscriminate access. Less vulnerableto overt political challenge than simply to ridicule or denial, tra-ditional authority in general appears most effective when a broadsocial consensus in a homogeneous society assumes that this au-thority follows the order of nature.206Bloch's example of the ritual construction of traditional authoritydemonstrates an important dimension of the construction of tra-dition. Yet another dimension of constructed tradition concerns thedelineation of group identity, which is based not only on generatinga shared consensus concerning an authoritative past but also on aset of distinctions, seen as rooted in the past, which differentiatesthis group from other groups. Staal notes the ability of ritual tra-ditions to \"identify groups and distinguish them from one another\"by means of distinctions as arbitrary as \"meaningless phonetic var-iations.\" He cites the example of two Vedic schools of ritual, theJaiminiya and the Kauthuma-Ranayaniya, who differ from each"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"12.2.  The Sense of Ritualother only in terms of minor grammatical distinctions with regardto vowel length in their traditional styles of Vedic recitation. Indeed,minor grammatical differences affecting the sounds of ritual chantshave always been a basis for distinguishing Vedic ritual traditions.Staal evokes a much larger issue with the observation that \"con-siderations of form and formal derivations and transformations areforemost in the minds of the ritualists,\" even though these formsmay be completely arbitrary.i07 Although they may be arbitraryfrom some perspectives, such permutations of form are the verystuff of ritually constructed traditions and identities.Hobsbawn describes the invention of a number of rituals in Amer-ica in the late nineteenth century that worked to differentiate Amer-icans and Americanism from the ethnicity and \"un-Americanism\"of the large numbers of immigrants entering the country at the time.Due to this heavy influx of foreigners, he writes, \"Americans hadto be made.\"108 And making Americans was the purpose, in thatperiod, of new public holidays and daily flag rituals in the schools.Likewise, the simultaneous defining of \"un-Americanism\" gener-ated \"an internal enemy against whom the good American couldassert his or her Americanism, not least by the punctilious perfor-mance of all the formal and informal rituals, the assertion of allthe beliefs conventionally and institutionally established as char-acteristic of good ^Americans.\"209 Hobsbawn concludes that tradi-tions are most effectively invented by appropriating elements thatare already closely associated with collective images of the past andthe values at stake. When such appropriation involves having towrest a set of images from the constructed past of another group,then the creation or assertion of tradition can become an arena fordramatic struggles among groups to carve out their own differen-tiated identities via shared symbols. The examples detailed by Bloch,Staal, and Hobsbawn suggest that the specifically 'ritual' construc-tion of tradition and communal identity may be a powerful andeffective strategy for several reasons. It appears to maximize theinvocation of authoritative precedent with all its connotations ofmoralism and nostalgia on the one hand, while recognizing a moreflexible level of delegated authority on the other. Similarly, it ap-pears to maximize the perception of consensus based on nonne-gotiable values and precedents, while nonetheless tolerating a fairdegree of latent conflict in the form of mere compliance, quiet"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Ritual Traditions and Systems 123evasion, or idiosyncratic rejection. The construction of traditionmay effectively maximize a high-profile identity for a group, evenwhile minimizing any real rift over fundamentals with the neigh-boring groups.Tradition, of course, is not created once and then left to its ownmomentum. Tradition exists because it is constantly produced andreproduced, pruned for a clear profile, and softened to absorb re-vitalizing elements. Whether it is being performed \"for the first timeor the thousandth, the circumstance of having been put in the ritualform,\" write Sally F. Moore and Barbara G. Myerhoff, gives some-thing the effect of tradition.210 It is possible that in some circum-stances, ritualized acts and environments are designed with suchrigid schemes of differentiation that the entry of a stray elementmakes that element a part of the rite forever after—as in the storiesfrom Kafka and Plutarch cited by J. Z. Smith.ZI1 But a rigid dis-tinction of sacred and profane, and the contamination or appro-priation of any profane thing that enters the realms of the sacred,however accidentally, is not particularly common to most traditionsof ritualization. It is interesting to speculate what sort of society orcommunity might employ such strategies, but the literary contextof both stories suggests further strategies at work, particularly in-tellectual textual strategies intending to polarize and dominate therealm of such religious practices. Yet Smith uses these stories totalk about routinization, illustrating that ritual is never simply therepetition of highly fixed activities or the desultory shouldering ofthe \"dead weight\" of tradition. The maintenance of a traditionthrough exact duplication of fixed activities is an inherently strategicreproduction and valorization of 'tradition'—in contrast not onlyto the correspondingly demeaned daily activities of the current sit-uation but also, and more pointedly perhaps, to the license to ri-tualize readily in and from the current situation. Such strictritualization may produce a pervasive state of cultural stasis, butthe ritualization is, in itself, a creative act of production, a strategicreproduction of the past in such a way as to maximize its domi-nation of the present, usually by particular authorities defined asthe sole guardians of the past and the experts on ritual.Theories that have defined ritual activity as first and foremostthe reenactment of historical or mythical precedents, such as thoseformulated by Eliade, risk a certain blindness to a group's constant"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"12.4  The Sense of Ritualreinterpretation of what constitutes these precedents and the com-munity's relationship to them. As I indicated earlier, the evocationof tradition differs significantly in the early Christian eucharisticmeal, the Roman rite codified by the Council of Trent, and thepost-Vatican II folk mass of liturgical renewal.ZIi These liturgiesdisplay not only different formulations of the significance of Christ'slast supper but also different understandings of the relationshipexisting between the ritual and the original event. Similarly, in eachcase a different type of community is constituted around differentvalues and forms of authority—and all within a relatively stableliturgical tradition that presents itself as quite fixed.It cannot be correct therefore to see ritualization as some stan-dardized process of 'traditionalization'—a position that Bloch orMoore and Myerhoff may seem to advocate. Ritual can be a stra-tegic way to 'traditionalize,' that is, to construct a type of tradition,but in doing so it can also challenge and renegotiate the very basisof tradition to the point of upending much of what had been seenas fixed previously or by other groups. Examples abound, rangingfrom the ascetic internalization of the Vedic sacrifice and the icon-oclasm of early Ch'an Buddhism to the Reformation's challenge topapal authority through a recreation of the free outpouring of thespirit to the early church. As with the invented traditions describedby Hobsbawn and Ranger, various attempts in American societyin the last two decades to create new rituals deemed more appro-priately symbolic and representative involve renegotiating a rep-ertoire of acknowledged ways of acting ritually. Such innovationsmay be subtle or dramatic; they may radically reappropriate tra-ditional elements or give a very different significance to standardactivities; they may overturn meanings completely through invertedpractices. The continuity, innovation, and oppositional contrastsestablished in each case are strategies that arise from the 'sense ofritual' played out under particular conditions—not in a fixed ritualstructure, a closed grammar, or an embalmed historical model.Spatial and Temporal SystemsThe basic logic involved in acts of ritualization is also seen in theritualized relationships of territorial groups by which they are linked"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Ritual Traditions and Systems  12,5within overarching systems of ritual practices. The internal orga-nization of such a ritual system is usually a complex orchestrationof standard binary oppositions that generate flexible sets of rela-tionships both differentiating and integrating activities, gods, sacredplaces, and communities vis-a-vis each other. Domestic rites con-trast with communal rites, male rites with female rites, preliminaryrites with culminating ones. Three interrelated sets of oppositionsin particular reveal the more systematic dimensions of ritualization:(i) the vertical opposition of superior and inferior, which generateshierarchical structures; (z) the horizontal opposition of here andthere, or us and them, which generates lateral or relatively egali-tarian relationships; and (3) the opposition of central and local,which frequently incorporates and dominates the precedingoppositions.Just as strategic differences in ritual traditions can differentiateparticular communities, ritualization can also work to integratecommunities. Indeed, ritualization appears to be a type of socialstrategy that can simultaneously do both. This is not due to anysynchronic structure it may be said to possess; on the contrary, theintegrations and differentiations effected by ritualized activities areclosely associated with ritual's temporal dimension. That is, theorchestration of rituals in time, some reproducing local commu-nities, others later integrating them or parts of them into largercommunities, enables each unit in the system to experience both itsown autonomy and its dependent place within a network of rela-tionships with other groups. This orchestration is not a perfect andholistic order imposed on minds and bodies but a delicate andcontinual renegotiation of provisional distinctions and integrationsso as to avoid encountering in practice the discrepancies and con-flicts that would become so apparent if the 'whole' was obvious/13In their respective studies of traditional Hawaiian sacrifice andmodern Taiwanese local ritual organizations, Valeri and Sangreneach explore the hierarchical systems generated by ritual withinwhich any particular ritual act or occasion is fully embedded. Al-though they have different positions on the significance of syn-chronic systems and structures, their ethnographies provide ampleevidence of the negotiation of the relationships that comprise theworking system. These relationships can be seen to simultaneouslydifferentiate and integrate communities in flexible ways.

He argues that ritually constituted territorial links are soimportant to Chinese life that no study could afford to focus onone particular village as a microcosm of society.215James Fox's detailed study of the ceremonial system of Savu, anisland off the eastern coast of Indonesia, underscores how a rela-tively complex ritual system is tightly linked with actual territory,with a calendrical cycle variously formulated by the four \"states\"involved in the system, with the organization of priests, and withthe pantheon and its authority. Particularly interesting are his ownefforts to compile a \"lacuna-free\" calendar reconciling differencesin practice in terms of some fundamental and underlying structure,despite how his own experiences neatly illustrate the very practicalnature of the differentiation and integration afforded by local for-mulations.116 When Fox conducted the unprecedented exercise oftaking a member of one regional group to view the local rites ofanother regional group, his Savunese friend was immediately veryshocked at the differences. He kept whispering to Fox that some-thing was very wrong in this region. At the same time, in Fox'sestimation, his friend was instinctively seeking out the \"ritual equiv-alences\" between the local rites going on around him and those ofhis own region, eventually discovering \"the essentials he was look-ing for.\" Before long he reassured Fox that the local ritual order\"was peculiar but perfectly correct.\"217Rappaport's exploration of the \"ecological processes\" involvedin ritual cycles is another type of example of a ritually constitutedsystem. Among the Tsembaga of New Guinea, rituals \"arranged inrepetitive sequences, regulate relations both within each of the [two]subsystems and within the larger complex system as a whole.\"218The first subsystem links the Tsembaga and their nonhuman en-vironment (pigs); the second involves their regional relationshipswith their human neighbors. Rappaport concludes that it is theritualization of their relations and interactions that enables themto maintain the environment, limit fighting, adjust the person-land"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Ritual Traditions and Systems  12.7ratios, and facilitate trade and the distribution of surplus pork,assuring sources of protein when they are needed.219 As such, re-ligious ritual does \"more than symbolize, validate, and intensifyrelationships,\" he argues; rather, it generates a \"ritually regulatedecosystem.\"\"0 Elsewhere Rappaport demonstrates that the ritualcycle not only regulates \"social, political and ecosystemic relations,\"but it also organizes and represents a \"hierarchy of understandings\"of the ritual activities themselves/21Bourdieu has described ritual systems such as the kula ring orthe potlach as \"consecration cycles\" whereby the ritual circulationof goods \"performs the fundamental operation of social alchemy,the transformation of arbitrary relations into legitimate relations,de facto differences into official recognized distinctions.\" The trans-formation of casual relations among arbitrarily distinguishedgroups into formal relations among officially distinct groups pro-vides the basis for lasting associations.222 Intrinsic to this processis not simply the differentiation of lateral groups, however, but alsothe establishment of hierarchical relations among them, even if thehigher positions are only temporarily occupied by those in posses-sion of the most valued objects. Hierarchy functions as the indis-pensable integrative complement to the processes of differentiationof groups and, in practice, the two forms of relationship are usuallyinseparable. Their appreciation of this principle leads T. Turner andValeri independently to conclude that hierarchy is intrinsic to ritualand vice versa.223Sangren provides an interesting example of one way in whichvertical (hierarchical) and horizontal (egalitarian) systems may in-teract. He specifically addresses the role of pilgrimage in Taiwanin establishing nonhierarchical, horizontal relations among localcommunities, particularly pilgrimages related to the cult of the god-dess Matsu. A type of patron saint for native Taiwanese identity,Matsu also belongs to a group of mother goddesses who undercutthe usual hierarchical pantheon and \"may be approached directlyby even the most humble pilgrim.\"224 However, it becomes readilyapparent that despite the egalitarian relations reproduced in theMatsu pilgrimage, her cult depends on various forms of hierarchicalintegration, most notably in terms of the pilgrims' route, whichproceeds up and down a hierarchical ladder of political centers.225In a similar example, Charles Keyes uncovered a traditional pil-"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Sense of Ritualgrimage system in northern Thailand in which a spatial set of twelvegeographical centers on the one hand are coordinated with a tem-poral cycle of animal years on the other. The twelve centers markprogressively more embracing Buddhist communities beyond thesphere of the local villages. Thus, the eleventh shrine, located inthe Tavatimsa heaven, and the twelfth, the site of the Buddha'senlightenment in India, ultimately embrace the whole Buddhist cos-mos. These centers are hierarchically ranked according to a scalebased on the scope and ultimacy of Buddhist doctrines. On theother hand, the animal year of one's birth directly links a personto one of these pilgrim shrines and the larger Buddhist communityit represents. The ultimate result of this system, Keyes suggests, isa series of \"moral orders, structured in space and time,\" linkingboth local and Buddhist reference systems.226These horizontal and vertical relations played out in time, whichare simultaneously the context and the very stuff of ritualization,may also be comprehended in terms of an opposition between cen-tral and local. A basic set of dynamics in many (but not all) ritualsystems is the construction of central rites from local ones and theconstruction of local rites from the simplification of central ones.In his study of the royal bath ceremony in Madagascar, Bloch arguesthat the intrinsic efficacy and compelling quality of the royal ritualderived precisely from the fact that it was composed of local ritualsequences simply rendered more elaborate and complex.227 Bloch'sstudy of Merina oratory likewise draws attention to how the formatof the village council meeting is a particularly elaborate and im-portant version of the format used every day when linked house-holds meet to organize the day's farming activities.228 Thisinterpenetration of the elaborate and the humble, or the central andthe local, is vital to the ritualization of systems and traditions.In an analysis of the codification of Chinese ritual during theT'ang dynasty (618—906 C.E.), David McMullen shows how centralrites were simplified for use in local communities with importantramifications.229 According to the T'ang code of rites, which wascompiled for imperial and official use, the lowest level of officialadministration and official ritual was the village. The code stipu-lated that the headman and community of each village should per-form an offering to the gods of soil and grain under a sacred tree.At the same time of the year, a more elaborate version of the sameix8"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Ritual Traditions and Systems  12,9offerings were made on the imperial level.230 A number of otherrituals were also repeated down a social hierarchy that was becom-ing a ritually constituted hierarchy. Intrinsic to this systemizationof ritual in the T'ang, McMullen points out, was the way in whichrites echoed other rites, implying them, assuming them, extendingthem/31 The effects were many: first, in their differences and sim-ilarities, ritual activities simultaneously differentiated and inte-grated the social world; second, replicated and resonating in thisway, the logic of these ritual activities would appear to be the verylogic organizing the social body and the rhythms of nature; andthird, ritual activities and relationships that did not conform to thebasic principles echoed throughout the system would immediatelystand out as problematic.The relationship between the Chinese state and local cults is aparticularly interesting and complex illustration of the issues at-tending ritual traditions and systems. Sangren's study of Matsupilgrimage, for example, also demonstrates how local cults thatevoke the unofficial and nonhierarchical imagery of the goddessMatsu are limited in prestige and the ability to grow unless theytranscend this basis for local group identity by appealing to variousstrategies of hierarchization. One such strategy is securing officialrecognition by the state, which involves the cooptation of the cultby a formal hierarchy of deities, rites, and temples.Z3Z Yet thiscooptation can be wonderfully muted in practice: villagers worshipthe goddess as they always have, but her official title promotes hercult elsewhere. The official bureaucracy itself has long used theappropriation of local cults into the formal pantheon as a majorstrategy for extending the control of the central government overoutlying areas. At the same time the newly titled local deities leg-itimated the national pantheon in the eyes of village communities.This \"reciprocal authentication of state and local cults,\" as Sangrendescribes it, illustrates the role of ritual in constructing center andperiphery/33The dynamics of social and cultural integration do not necessarilyimply a single, monolithic system of gods, practices, or values ac-cepted in the same way by all groups in the society. It has beensuggested that the unity of Chinese culture has lain less in thecontent than in the form of its cultural practices.

In other words,the more or less practical organization of ritual activities neitheracts upon nor reflects the social system; rather, these loosely co-ordinated activities are constantly differentiating and integrating,establishing and subverting the field of social relations. Hence, suchexpedient systems of ritualized relations are not primarily concernedwith 'social integration' alone, in the Durkheimian sense. Insofaras they establish hierarchical social relations, they are also con-cerned with distinguishing local identities, ordering social differ-ences, and controlling the contention and negotiation involved inthe appropriation of symbols.Ritual SpecialistsRelatively little attention has been paid to how the presence ofspecialists affects ritual practices. Their presence or absence is usu-ally taken simply as an index to the importance of ritual or thestratification of society. In discussing the rise of religious specialists,Joachim Wach notes that the most fundamental differentiations oflabor in religious activities are based first on gender, then on age,and finally, in societies with occupational, social, or economic strat-ification, on a classification of functions, status, and authority.135Douglas's typologies have gone further to link the degree and im-portance of gender and age distinction to Wach's third considera-tion, the degree of social stratification. Douglas finds ritualspecialists in stratified or \"high-grid\" societies, and she correlatesthe status of such specialists with a pronounced social hierarchyand a social ethos of piety toward authority/36 By contrast, for asociety in which the social hierarchy is weakly defined, rituals aremore likely to be generated without officially trained or designatedspecialists/37"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Ritual Traditions and Systems  131Aside from such correlations of ritual expertise and authoritywith social divisions of labor and prestige, the most influentialattempt to explain the rise of religious and ritual specialists hasbeen Max Weber's theory of rationalization. Implying a develop-mental process of increasing rationality, Weber distinguished themagician, the priest, and the charismatic prophet as basic types ofreligious authority/38 It sometimes appears, however, that increasedrationalization does not explain the emergence of these types somuch as the interaction of these specialists might explain the de-velopment of rationalization/39 There have been many attempts toreclothe the skeletal outlines of Weber's notion of rationalization,but two in particular are useful for the issues concerning rituali-zation. The first is a neo-Marxist interpretation represented earliestby Georg Lukacs but recently refitted by Jameson and Bourdieu.For them, rationalization is primarily a process of 'reification' or'objectification.' A second interpretation is provided by Goody'swork on the cultural effects of literacy on social organization andthe rise of particular types of authority.In the Marxist discussion, reification implies that rationalizationis accompanied by a process in which the relationships among hu-man beings become objectified as relations among things, mostreadily seen in the generation of official titles, institutions, person-nel, and even official language.240 Face to face relations amongpeople give way to indirect relations by institutions in addition toconcomitant changes in the nature of power and the way it isexercised. The development of a body of specialized agents whopossess or control important mechanisms of objectification, suchas ritual or educational institutions, is the development of a formof control that can be more total because it is more indirect andinvisible. In this development, social control via coercive strategiesdemanding personal presence and explicit conflict begin to shift tosocial control via ownership of the means by which 'reality' isarticulated for cognitive endorsement by all/41 This process is in-separable from the development of institutions which ensure thatsuch specialists do not need constant popular support in order tosurvive. As institutions of specialists take on the formulation ofreality, there is a decreased need for personal or collective ritualsto assume that function/4* Ultimately, when the strategies of ri-tualization are dominated by a special group, recognized as official"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"132  The Sense of Ritualexperts, the definition of reality that they objectify works primarilyto retain the status and authority of the experts themselves/43This analysis coincides with many of the conclusions drawn byGoody in his work on the effects of literacy. There is a fair amountof agreement, for example, when both approaches attempt to de-lineate shifts in the strategies of ritualization that attend the rise ofritual specialists, ritual discourse, and the elaboration of rules andoffices. However, when reinterpreted in terms of the impact ofliteracy upon social relations, rationalization reveals—more fullythan in the Marxist discussion—the gradual but total sea changein the nature of almost all social interactions. Goody suggests thatwhen Weber's theory is reanalyzed in terms of the use of writing,some of its most central points—such as the stratification of reli-gious leadership, the emergence of orthodoxy over doxa, the riseof ethical universalism, or the generalization of norms—emergeeven more clearly. They emerge, moreover, hand in hand with theirown inherent historical contradictions, such as the problems thataccompany the particular and local application of universalizednorms or the difficulties of changing what is fixed as orthodox asit becomes increasingly irrelevant to the community.244 Goody'sapproach also complements Douglas's correlation of ethical reli-gions with particular forms of social organization: where belief inrational doctrines takes the place of ritualism, sacraments becomemere symbols rather than immediate sources of power and priestlymediation is rejected in favor of the personal commitment of eachindividual.245 Douglas effectively correlates such phenomena, butwith the exception of \"secularism\" provides little explanation ofhow they come about. Goody, on the other hand, illustrates hisapproach with a description of the development of the priesthoodand pantheon in ancient Egypt in terms of the possession and con-trol of writing. Yet this example suggests a lacuna in his overalltheory: oral societies also have specialists. His concern with theeffects of literacy on religious specialization forces him to give littleattention to the organization of ritual specialists in oral societies.Hence, he tends to overestimate writing as a medium uniquelysubject to the control of specialists.246 In fact, Weberian theory andits modern revisions tend to grant enormous power to ritual expertsin control of vital media for formulating the nature of reality. Yetthe evidence suggests that the relationships within which such ex-"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Ritual Traditions and Systems  133perts operate are much more qualified, reciprocal, and strategicallydefined.In two examples mentioned earlier, the Savunese of Indonesiadescribed by Fox and the Hawaiians described by Valeri, the sys-temization of rites is closely linked to the systemization of special-ists, the pantheon, the temple network, and the ritual calender.Both forms of systemization can be seen to unfold according tostrategies peculiar to ritualization. Although neither ethnographypresents much material on the history of the priesthood, both testifyto complex systems that simultaneously embody hierarchy and op-position. For example, among the numerous and complex classesof traditional religious specialists, Valeri notes three groups ofpriests. The first group, the kahuna pule, or priests of the centralcult, tend to be hereditary priests drawn from the nobility to officiatein the temples of the nobility, for which services they have landrights. There are two important orders, that of the god Ku and thatof the god Lono, but the high priest of the Ku order is chaplain tothe king and thus has authority over the Lono priests. Indeed, theKu high priest is integral to the social structure that culminates inthe king since he, as high priest, controls the ritual that legitimizesthe king. Yet despite his importance, the Ku high priest defers tothe king as the true head of the cult and polity/47A second group, whom Valeri calls \"professional kahuna\" iscomprised of a heterogeneous number of ritual and medical spe-cialists, including sorcerers. Sorcerers are excluded from rites ofpurification and, therefore, are considered impure in contrast to thekahuna pule. Their impurity is also associated with various featuresof marginality, particularly an asocial individualism considered re-sistant to the social order and an ethos of repressed destructivedesires. While their functions are not necessarily antagonistic to thekahuna pule, they are likely to be politically contentious. None-theless, they are regularly sought out for their skills in healing andwield great influence through these services/48The opposition of the sorcerers and the kahuna pule is curiouslybalanced by another and quite different opposition between thecentral cult and a third group, the kaula prophets. These prophetsdo not oppose society as the sorcerers do; rather, they transcend itthrough an individualistic and socially marginal mysticism. Ac-cording to Valeri, \"The kaula isolate themselves from society to"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"134  The Sense of Ritualreach the gods without passing through the social mediation of thehuman hierarchy or of the specialists.\"i49 Hence, they have no needto sacrifice and little need for the social order at all. From theirdirect relationship with the gods, moreover, they are thought tospeak for the deity and to possess the ability to predict the fate ofthe community. Their mana is actually greater than that of thekahuna pule.In sum, no one group of ritual experts appears to have unqualifiedauthority. Moreover, the type of authority of any one group seemsbalanced or even undermined by the very different configurationsof power characteristic of the other groups. Clearly priestly au-thority has been strategically defined and constrained.Some features appear to be basic to systems of ritual specialistswith or without literacy. Most obvious, of course, is how theirauthority rests on the intrinsic importance of ritual as a means ofmediating the relations between humans and nonhuman powers.Yet correct performance of the ritual tends to be critical to itsefficacy. An emphasis on the correctness of performance promotesand maintains expertise, but it is not uncommon that other groups,such as the general audience or another lineage of experts, have theright to pass judgment on the performance's correctness. Moreover,the power to do the ritual correctly resides in the specialist's offi-cially recognized or appointed status (office), not in the personhoodor personality of the specialist. In this way, the institutionalizedoffice can control, constrain, and pass judgment on a specialist. Theseparation of the person and the office not only stabilizes the spe-cialist's power and legitimizes it through the social sanctions bywhich the office is given and recognized; it also controls that powerby requiring its conformity to establish models. Indeed, variousstudies have suggested that the emergence of a priesthood—reli-gious specialists by virtue of holding an office—provides a stabi-lization and control of religious power not possible with shamanicor mediumistic mediators.250 While this type of stabilized power isclearly linked to the role of institutions in conferring or authenti-cating expertise, it is far from obvious that such priests possess thenearly unlimited power to define reality suggested by Weberiantheory.Another feature of the organization of ritual specialists, namely,the ranking of ritual activities, also qualifies their supposed power."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Ritual Traditions and Systems 135Those rites in which specialists preside are generally seen as morecentral, powerful, encompassing, and integral to the welfare of thewhole than those that employ more locally skilled practioners ornone at all. Although ritual practices on this local and immediatelevel inevitably have less overt prestige, this should not obscure howthey can be the backbone of any effective systemization of ritualpractices.251 In Vedic ritual, for example, the hierarchization ofritual activities that relates the domestic gryha sacrifice to the centralsrauta or haviryajna sacrifice is tightly linked to the emergence ofa powerful priesthood and their role in the organization of ritualknowledge and ritual practice/52 Textual evidence suggests thatdomestic rites played little if any role in the earliest Vedic sacrifices,but with the composition of the ritual sutras \"domestic ritual wasincluded within a totalistic system... [and] participated in the webof interrelations linking the components of that system,\" eventhough its position was on \"the lowest level possible within theVedic ritual universe.\"253 This absorption of domestic ritual appearsto have been promoted by brahmins in order to secure their controlover all forms of ritual, although the exact history of the phenom-enon is not known.254 As a part of an encompassing ritual system,the domestic rite came to have a complex position. On the onehand, it was the lowest level of ritual and the least amount ofknowledge, purity, and status was required—granting, of course,that it could be performed only by a \"qualified male, one who hasbeen initiated and has learned some portion of the Veda.\"255 Inaddition, however, it was seen as feminine, simple, weak, and hu-man or earthly as opposed to the virile, complex, powerful, anddivine Vedic sacrifice. On the other hand, the fire for the domesticsacrifice was carefully distinguished from the cooking fire and hadto be maintained for the duration of the household. Thus, despiteits lowliness in the hierarchy, it was clearly distinguished fromnonritual activities and thus a part of the system. More to the point,perhaps, the domestic sacrifice was also seen as the basic or \"con-densed\" form of the grandest srauta sacrifice, with the latter as an\"extension\" or elaboration of the domestic. According to B. K.Smith, the domestic rite was all sacrifices: \"The srauta ritual is an'extended' version of the domestic sacrifice, and the domestic is acondensed counterpart of the srauta,\"256 Hence, when differentiatedas a fire that is not the cooking fire, the domestic altar and its"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"136  The Sense of Ritualactivities come to be part of a vast ritual system by virtue of therelational principles of hierarchy, identity, and opposition. The hi-erarchy can be collapsed into the opposition of male and female,srauta and gryha. The differentiations can be elaborated to generatethe whole hierarchy or to point to the identity underlying all itsmanifold forms. With all its ranks and complexity, Smith pointsout, the Vedic system of hierarchy can be completely undone bythe egalitarian principle of the fundamental identity of all rituals/57Hence, this systemization is hardly fixed or unambivalent. Itsclear hierarchy is built out of basic oppositions that secure thegeneration of a more or less integrated totality. At the same time,a dynamic principle of identity can demolish even this complextotality into undifferentiated unity. The systemization itself effec-tively objectifies the status and authority of the brahmin ritual ex-pert as well as the integral place of the domestic rite.158 A similarambivalence was seen in Valeri's account of the hierarchy and op-position in the Hawaiian systemization of specialists. The varietyof specialists there suggested an inherent structural flexibility. Moreimportant, it suggests that the relationships among specialists arethemselves an embodiment of the principles manipulated and re-produced in ritual activities. A variety of schemes are held in loosebut easily shifting relationships to each other/59The codification of ritual procedures in textual form involvesstrategies of ritualization different from those effective in primarilyoral societies. Indeed, the very act of putting ritual practices intosuch a format constitutes a tactical recasting of the source and typeof authority invoked in ritualization. In general, such textual cod-ification involves a shift from the authority of memory, seniority,and practical expertise (e.g., \"traditional authority,\" according toWeber and Bloch) to the authority of those who control access toand interpretation of the texts.260The fixing of the past in writing can open a gap between thepresent and the past that appears to demand different forms ofmediating authority—perhaps an authority that represents 'sanc-tified tradition' not through a convincing evocation of the continuityof the past with the present but through privileged access to the'sources' of the past. Certainly, the influence of literacy and textualmodels of practice means that the past can no longer be so readilyrecontextualized in the present. Instead, the past appears to exist"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Ritual Traditions and Systems 137independently of the present and in need of reconciliation with it.A textually constituted tradition must continually and simulta-neously create both the gap and the authority structures that canbridge it. Goody suggests that priestly control of literacy and sacredtexts promotes the codification and standardization of 'orthodox'ritual practices in textual form, which in turn establishes a basisfor a type of interpretive and exegetical discourse.261 Such discourseworks to constitutes a class of experts and vice versa. These expertsmaintain both the pastness of the past and their access to it throughthe elaborate medium of a discipline of interpretion with its meth-ods, skills, first principles, institutions, and credentials.Standardization has other ramifications for practice. In the ritualsystems of primarily oral societies, such as the traditional Hawaiiansociety described by Valeri, the sense of what is traditional andlegitimate stays more or less closely (and homeostatically) relatedto what is practiced—since both past and present are open fordefinition. But writing 'fixes' things, turning patterns of custom intopreserved models of tradition.262 As a result, changes are noticed:whether resisted or promoted they generate complex processes ofinterpretation or even cataclysmic reform, rather than gradual andbarely conscious adaptation.263 Thus, hand in hand with the cod-ification of ritual comes the need to sanction changes in the un-changing. When accomplished through a variety of reinterpretivetechniques (juxtaposition of an oral tradition, legal reasoning, the-ological speculation, etc.) it leads to the proliferation of textsamending the tradition and institutions legitimizing the emenda-tions; when accomplished through the upheavals of reform, investedauthority may be painfully recalled only to be lodged more defin-itively in the text alone.264Textual codification and standardization also open a gap be-tween what is written and what is done by promoting an idealof uniformity and the elimination or marginalization of alterna-tives. Frequently the result is a written ideal quite alienated fromwhat is in fact being done in common practice.265 As a conse-quence of standardization, the very sense of ritual in a culturemay well come to embody forms such as those dominant in theWest since the Enlightenment, namely, ritual as a secondary en-actment of prior mental states or belief convictions, the rote imi-tation of prescribed acts, or the performance of a script. From"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"138  The Sense of Ritualthis perspective, rituals without textual roots and textual com-mentary easily come to be regarded as magical, pseudoscientific,or devotional attempts to achieve direct results. When fixed inwriting, prayers are 'repeated' verbatim at the expense of adap-tive invention, opening a gap between the language of ritual andthe language of daily life. The exaggeration of this gap throughthe use of archaic language may lead to the emergence of archai-cization as a basic strategy of ritualization/66As a formal topic of speculation and the object of an interpre-tive industry, canonical texts indirectly promote those activitiesthat enhance the status of those reflecting upon, interpreting, andteaching the texts, perhaps at the expense of those more immedi-ately involved in ritual. Goody relates such developments to theemerging importance of internal states of mind. For example,blood sacrifice gives way to the mental concentration of the met-aphorical or internal sacrifice.167 Another example is the develop-ment of canonical or ritualized modes of thought/68 B. K. Smithdescribes such a phenomenon in Vedic-Hindu culture: While re-maining a basic element of Indian life, the system of Vedic ritualis now primarily used as a strategy of \"traditionalization,\" apractical logic of explanatory categories for rendering the neworthodox and canonical/69The textualization of ritual practices has been linked to thepromotion of universal values over local ones and the emergenceof orthodoxy over orthopraxy.270 Yet there is little evidence thatthe emergence of literacy and the textualization of ritual prac-tices moves through history with an inexorable logic and defini-tive set of effects. Texts appear to be used, and not used, in awide variety of ways. Kristofer Schipper's analysis of the distinc-tions among various categories of ritual specialists in Taiwangraphically illustrates assorted strategies for the use of ritualtexts and texts in ritual. Written texts read during the ritual per-formance is one of the features that differentiate the classicalrites of the 'Black-head' lineage of Taoist masters, the tao-shih,or master of the Tao, from the vernacular rites of the 'Red-head'Taoist masters, the fa-shih, or master of the law. The latter mayhave texts present, almost like props, but he will recite the pray-ers from memory instead of reading them. Similarly, the classicalstyle of the tao-shih specifically emphasizes the universal through"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Ritual Traditions and Systems 139an impersonal formality, whereas the vernacular style of the fa-shih allows for the particular and the personal. Yet the merepresence of an unread liturgical text in the rites of the fa-shihdraws an important distinction between these local Taoist spe-cialists and yet another level of ritualist, the local expert intrance and divination. And in the classical lineage of the tao-shih, despite his textual differentiation, orally transmitted in-structions and information, as well as indecipherable talismanicsigns, are integral to his training and easily dwarf the substanceof what is actually contained in his texts.271 Texts are strategicmarkers of status, scope, and doctrine and are manipulated assuch.James Watson's study of the complex system of types and gradesof funeral specialists in Hong Kong presents a similar picture. Hefound texts present at Cantonese funerals; although none of priestscould read them, they pretended to. Cantonese funeral priests ap-pear to be only slightly better educated than the average villager,sufficiently so to be able to prepare the written materials neededfor the ritual, but they cannot read most books with any ease.Nonetheless, their prestige and authority rest on their relative degreeof literary skill.272 James Hayes also notes the relative status of alittle learning, its role in constituting a \"specialist,\" and the readyappeal to a rich variety of such experts for all types of circum-stances.273 Watson and Hayes both conclude that paid profession-als, characterized by some literary skill, are a uniform and universalfeature of Chinese ritual. Yet Susan Naquin illustrates somethingof an opposite impulse when she describes how the public canbypass the experts and clergy by buying specially printed petitionsof their own.274 The availability of printed materials can redefineor undermine liturgical expertise, but appears to do so only asanother strategy, coexisting with, not replacing, traditional respectfor such expertise. Staal's study of the Nambudiri brahmins ofKerala in southwest India argues that their oral transmission of theVedas has remained quite independent of the textual tradition thatsubsequently arose. When scholars would bring out the textualversion of a ritual that the Nambudiri were planning to performand point out the differences, the brahmins would nod politely andgo on doing things the way they knew was correct, the way theirfathers had taught them.275 Of course, the rather minimal variations"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"140  The Sense of Ritualin practice that attend their oral tradition is a well known but stillstriking phenomenon.These examples suggest that textualization is not an inevitablelinear process of social evolution, as Weber's model of rationali-zation may seem to imply. The dynamic interaction of texts andrites, reading and chanting, the word fixed and the word preachedare practices, not social developments of a fixed nature and signif-icance. As practices, they continually play off each other to rene-gotiate tradition, authority, and the hegemonic order. As practices,they invite and expect the strategic counterplay.Rethinking Ritual as PracticeI have not proposed a new theory of ritual because I believe thata new theory of ritual, by definition, would do little to solve thereal conundrums that the study of ritual has come up against. In-stead, I have proposed a new framework within which to reconsidertraditional questions about ritual. In this framework, ritual activ-ities are restored to their rightful context, the multitude of ways ofacting in a particular culture. When put in the context of purposiveactivity with all the characteristics of human practice (strategy,specificity, misrecognition, and redemptive hegemony), a focus onritual yields to a focus on ritualization.Ritualization, the production of ritualized acts, can be described,in part, as that way of acting that sets itself off from other waysof acting by virtue of the way in which it does what it does. Evenmore circularly, it can be described as the strategic production ofexpedient schemes that structure an environment in such a way thatthe environment appears to be the source of the schemes and theirvalues.Ritualizing schemes invoke a series of privileged oppositions that,when acted in space and time through a series of movements, ges-tures, and sounds, effectively structure and nuance an environment.In the organization of this environment some oppositions quietlydominate others but all also defer to others in a redundantly cir-cular, and hence nearly infinite, chain of associations. The coher-ence, continuity, and general scope of these associations naturalize"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Ritual Traditions and Systems  141the values expressed in the subtle relationships established amongoppositions.This environment, constructed and reconstructed by the ac-tions of the social agents within it, provides an experience of theobjective reality of the embodied subjective schemes that havecreated it. Ritualization as a strategic way of acting does not seethe social agent's projection of this environment or his or herreembodiment of the sets of schemes constitutive of it. Whenthese schemes are embodied in a cultural sense of reality andpossibility, the agent is capable of interpreting and manipulatingsimply by reclassifying the very relationships understood as con-stitutive of reality.The goal of ritualization as a strategic way of acting is the ri-tualization of social agents. Ritualization endows these agentswith some degree of ritual mastery. This mastery is an internali-zation of schemes with which they are capable of reinterpretingreality in such a way as to afford perceptions and experiences ofa redemptive hegemonic order. Ritualization always aligns onewithin a series of relationship linked to the ultimate sources ofpower. Whether ritual empowers or disempowers one in somepractical sense, it always suggests the ultimate coherence of acosmos in which one takes a particular place. This cosmos is ex-perienced as a chain of states or an order of existence that placesone securely in a field of action and in alignment with the ulti-mate goals of all action.Ritualization is probably an effective way of acting only undercertain cultural circumstances. But what counts as ritual canrarely be pinned down in general since ritualized practices con-stantly play off the field of action in which they emerge, whetherthat field involves other ritualized activities, ordinary actiondeemed by the contrast to be spontaneous and practical, or bothat the same time.This description of acting ritually does not necessarily add up toa neat theoretical model that can be readily applied elsewhere todata of various kinds. Rather, it has been an exercise in taking apartone understanding of ritual and putting together a very differentcontext for reflection, one in which ritual as such does not exist.This reorientation to ways of acting allows the blurring of defini-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"142.

Leach, for example, sees ritual as the noninstrumentalcomponent of action, the part which primarily communicates sym-bolically (The Political Systems of Highland Burma, 2,nd ed. [London:Athlone Press, 1964], p. 13). This approach was also promoted byJohn H. M. Beattie, who described ritual as expressive versus in-strumental behavior in order to avoid categorizing it as either rationalor irrational, scientific or practical (\"Ritual and Social Change,\" Man143"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"144  Notesi [1966]: 60-74; and \"On Understanding Ritual,\" in Rationality,ed.

Ina similar way Richard Schechner distinguishes performances along abinary continuum ranging from efficacy (as in ritual) to entertainment(as in theater) (see Essays on Performance Theory 1970-1976 [NewYork: Drama Book Specialists, 1977], p. 75). Valerio Valeri makesa distinction between pragmatic and ritual actions, arguing that al-though they are not fundamentally different, they are distinct in theirdegree of order and parallel or complement each other (Kingship andSacrifice: Ritual and Society in Ancient Hawaii [Chicago: Universityof Chicago Press, 1985], pp. 153—54). This is close to the positionof Tambiah on ritual (or magical) activity vis-a-vis technical activity;he argues that ritual activities are a model and/or interpretation ofthe technical activities with which they have a serial relationship(\"The Magical Power of Words,\" pp. 198—203). Tambiah also arguesthat sacred and profane language do not fundamentally differ; theformer simply involves a heightened use of the features of metaphorand metonomy seen in all language (pp. 182,, 184, 186-89).

One term dominates the other by virtue of its replication in homol-ogous oppositions, appearing to become immobilized, reified, andprimary, thereby implying an objective and self-legitimating reality.It seems that this type of immobilization can take place despite theoriginal impulse of the theorist to overcome the inadequacy of thetwo dichotomous abstractions, such as structure and act, with whichthe analysis began. The reason for this result, as suggested in Part I,appears to be the incredibly persuasive semblance of logical theo-retical discourse that results, a semblance dependent upon the nearlyhidden rigidification (and absolutization) of one term. When thesetwo roles are played out on various homologized levels of argumen-tation, the original dichotomy (structure and act) launches the syn-thesis of a new term (culture), which in subsequent opposition toanother version of the original dichotomy (history as the synthesisof structure and act) generates yet another synthetic abstraction (cul-tural praxis or historical process). When constructed in this way, thelast synthetic term is then analyzed by breaking it back down intoits components. As an example of this form of argument, see Com-aroff s distinction between structure and practice (p. 44), and herdiscussion of the mediation of structure and practice in ritual (pp.78-120).43.

Bourdieu'spresentation of the notion of habitus is not very clear. Sometimes itsounds like the principle of practice; at other times, it is more likeone end of a spectrum of forms of objectification on which moreexplicit cultural schemes, such as law, take up the other end (pp. 18—2,0). Ortner appears to interpret Bourdieu's habitus not as an instanceof practice (embodying her notions of act and structure), but struc-ture; thus she finds his analysis to be ahistorical (High Religion,pp. 13, 195-97)-53.

My use of it follows more immediately from Bourdieu (Out-line of a Theory of Practice, pp. 3-9), who uses it in part to stresshow activity is not a matter of following rules of the type amenableto formulation by theorists. In an attempt to depart from the \"mal-function\" perspective of psychotherapy, R. D. Laing also focused on\"strategic\" behavior as ways of coping (according to Skinner, p. 9).Ortner discusses a \"strategic model\" of action in \"Theory in An-thropology Since the Sixties\" (p. 150). Michel de Certeau distin-guishes \"tactics\" and \"strategies\" in talking about everyday practicesas ways of operating or doing things (The Practice of Everyday Life,trans.

The linguists Mark Johnson and George Lakoff, among others,present interesting evidence for processes of communication andunderstanding based on how \"nonpropositional schemata\" generatemeaning without the formulation of propositions. They find that suchnonpropositional schemata include three types of structures: basic-level categories, kinesthetic images, and metaphorical projections.Lakoff focuses on the first two, basic-level categories and kines-thetic images, as preconceptual structures that directly organize bod-ily experience and indirectly organize conceptual categories. Basic-level categories turn up in the middle of cultural taxonomic systems,specifying what is known as the level of genus, such as cat, dog, tree,and chair, but not Cheshire cat or collie, which descend levels ofspecification, or \"all growing things\" or \"all furniture,\" which ascendlevels of generalization. He finds that this middle level is basic in twoimportant ways. First, it is the level where people appear most easilyto perceive a single holistic gestalt, where distinct objects are mostclearly associated with distinct motor movements of the body, andwhere people most readily learn, remember, and agree on differentshapes and activities. Thus, this middle-level of categories is both apsychologically and socially basic level from which people proceedto generalize more encompassing levels of classes and differentiatemore narrowly defined classes. It is on this level that researchers finda dramatic consensus across culturally quite different classificationsystems. For example, in color classification systems, there is cross-cultural consensus at the level of basic colors (black, white, red, etc.),which the eye is equipped to differentiate most immediately, but thereis little consensus on the differentiation of nonbasic colors. There isa similar cross-cultural consensus in establishing clearly boundedcategories at the level of birds, dogs, cats, trees, and flowers, withsimilar \"prototypical\" examples for each, whereas there is little con-sensus in more refined or generalized levels of classification (Lakoff,pp. 2.4—30). In Lakoff's second point about middle-level categories,he notes that it is on this level of classification that people appear toexperience the maximum sense of \"fit\" between their inherited folkcategories and the world as they experience it. In other words, it isat this level that people's categories are experienced as real, verifiableby experience, and sufficiently socially stable to be the building blocksof shared knowledge systems (Lakoff, pp. 32-37, 46, zoo)."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"158  NotesThe second set of preconceptual structures described by Lakoffare kinesthetic image schemes, which are relatively simple struc-tures that constantly recur in bodily experience. Examples includewithin—without, front—behind, center—periphery, up—down, part-whole. These schemes form the experiential bases of the thirdstructure explored by Lakoff and Johnson, metaphorical projec-tions of these kinesthetic images to create abstract ideas (Lakoff,pp. 267-68, 2,72-76).Lakoff and Johnson's materials can be interpreted as a challengeto those, like Tambiah, who would describe ritual practices as com-municating (not through the formulation of propositions) by meansof \"modeling\" an image that can act as a sign. There is a very strongtendency, particularly evident in the work of V. Turner and Valeri,to see the meaning and work of ritual as condensed in such signs/symbols. Lakoff and Johnson suggest, however, that any such processof condensation of categories and relationships into a sign/symbolproceeds from the way in which the body experiences and projectsnonpropositional schemes. Hence, the sign/symbol molded by theseschemes in the course of the ritual activities is a part of the \"envi-ronment\" produced by ritualization. The sign is misrecognized asimpressing itself on and exacting responsiveness from the partici-pants. To focus on the ritually created sign/symbol as the unit ormechanism of ritual is to miss the more fundamental dynamics ofritualization.V. Turner proposed that such condensed symbols are the basicunit of ritual. While Valeri follows him in noting the effects of thecondensed symbol on participants, he also notes how they constructthat symbol in the activities of the rite. The data discussed here couldlead to a new formulation of the argument, represented by the po-sitions of V. Turner and Levi-Strauss, on whether ritual creates socialcategories or social categories create ritual ones.185. Rappaport, p. 201.186.

However, one can find a number of ritual activities,particularly in the United States today, that involve quite casual lan-guage and linguistic flexibility, although formulas of some type arevery prevalent. On the other hand, Bloch's argument is concernedwith the ritual creation of \"traditional authority,\" not necessarily allritual activities.

On the greater usefulness of asking\"how does ritual work\" over \"what is ritual,\" see Dreyfus and Ra-binow's discussion of Foucault's approach to power (p. 117). I haverepeatedly cast the issue as a question of the \"efficacy\" of ritual,since literature on the \"efficacy\" of ritual usually concerns how ritesare seen to fulfill the expectations of those involved in them, ratherthan the expectations of theorists as to how they work. On efficacyin general, see Ahern, who reviews various theories of ritual efficacy(pp. 1-17).

Wat-son notes that \"the Chinese state intervened in local cults in subtleways to impose a kind of unity on regional and local-level cults,\"which resulted in \"a surprisingly high degree of uniformity\" (p. 293).Indeed, the promotion of state-approved cults was so successful inplaces that it effectively drove out the worship of local gods. Watsonspecifically explores the cult of the goddess Tien Hou, the officialtitle conferred on the goddess whom Sangren studied under her orig-inal name, Matsu. He describes how the state decided that it was\"expedient\" to adopt and endorse her to assist in the pacification ofthe southern coastal regions in the twelfth century. As a result shebecame the focus of most of the religious worship in that region.Thus, he tracks the \"up and down\" flow of ideas by which \"a minordeity... was adopted by the state, transformed in important ways,and then reimposed on local communities as an officially recognizedgoddess\" (p. 294). Yet Watson does not simply interpret the extendedTien Hou cult in terms of the integrative functions formulated byDurkheim. He also finds represented in the goddess's cults a hierarchyof understanding and power: she came to mean something differentto different groups of people according to their place in this hierarchy.Thus, among local elites, building temples for the goddess signaledtheir willingness \"to join the mainstream of Chinese culture.\" How-ever, among semiliterate landowning lineages, and in direct contrastto the role of her cult in Taiwan, the goddess is seen as \"jealous andvindictive,\" closely associated with bitter territorial distinctions andloyalties. Thus, in this context, she is not a motherly figure whopromotes the transcendence of local affiliations through pilgrimageand festivals (pp. 312—13, 318—19). In terms of cultural integration,Watson's study also suggests that a hierarchy of power may be in-trinsically necessary to the dynamics of cultural integration.234. Sangren, p. 124. Watson's emphasis on form over content and San-gren's on a principle of pure hierarchy are somewhat awkward intheir current formulations, but both men are pointing to how strat-egies of ritualization (particularly hierarchization, homologization,and privileged opposition), variously deployed in many different sit-uations, generate a differentiated and integrated social system.235.

Peter Brown (The Making of Late Antiquity [Cambridge, Mass.:Harvard University Press, 1978], pp. 12, 19), for example, has de-scribed how the nature and \"locus\" of divine power shifted in thelate antique world to mean something from \"outside the humancommunity\" that could be represented on earth by specially empow-ered agents whose relationship with the supernatural was stable,irreversible, and clearly distinct from that of the sorcerer. A similarsituation attended the emergence of a Taoist priesthood; see Cath-erine Bell, \"Ritualization of Texts and Textualization of Ritual inthe Codification of Taoist Liturgy,\" History of Religions 27, no. 4(1988): 366-92,.251.

The brahmin's ritual expertise ultimately comes to depend on fourfactors: caste, which inscribes social distinctions and hierarchy intothe very structure of the cosmos; initiation into study of the Vedasas a \"twice-born\" male through the upanayana ritual; training inrecitation of the Vedas, a feat requiring careful pedagogy, memori-zation, and leisure time that dramatically reduces accessibility; andthe performance of successively powerful rituals, the more impressiveof which can be undertaken only by someone who has performedothers in a series. Staal describes the importance of the chants in theconstruction of the fire altar: \"Under duress, ritual acts may be ne-glected, glossed over, or changed, but recitations must be maintainedat all cost, and without modification The construction of the firealtar involves the deposition of more than a thousand bricks, ofspecific sizes and shapes, and in a complicated pattern. However, thephysical deposition of the bricks is unimportant, what counts in theirconsecration by mantras. This is obvious from the fact that, thoughthe order of bricks is ritually prescribed, the bricks are actually putdown in any order, and not at the proper time. When they are con-secrated, however, the prescribed order is adhered to and the correcttime is observed That this emphasis on mantras has been the samefor at least 2.500 years is demonstrated by a statement in the SatapathaBrahmana (9.1.2.17): This fire altar is language, for it is constructedwith language.\"* (Frits Staal, Agni: The Vedic Ritual of the Fire Altar,2 vols. [Berkeley, Calif.: Asian Humanities Press, 1983], vol. i, p. 18).The language is the exclusive property of each brahmin tradition,transmitted only from master to student, and except for the namesof deities, generally unintelligible even to the brahmin.259. Valeri notes the openness of the pantheon at the bottom level, wherethe spontaneous generation of deities frequently occurs (p. 36).260. There are many examples of ritual codifications granting a centralplace to those rites that legitimate the ruler while simultaneouslylinking those rites to traditional practices present throughout thesocial hierarchy.

It has long beenan assumption of modernization theory that individualism, universalvalues, and moral/ethical concerns bring about a decreased relianceon ritual. Some historians of literacy and its cultural impact alsomake this connection (Stock, p. 50). Douglas's typologies, of course,also suggest that ritual is less dense and important in societies withthese features. Yet there is really very little evidence to suggest thatritual in general declines per se. It may be more accurate to say thatit shifts. For example, as the scale of the community grows, as in theemergence of a \"national\" community, the density of ritual is rear-ranged, as certain social ties diminish in importance within the newhierarchy or become more critical for the constitution of community.National rituals may emerge as local village life breaks down, orvoluntary organizations that cut across older relations of kin andvillage may emerge as centers or purveyors of ritual activities.268.

Goody has strongly argued for the role of writing and standardizationin promoting universal values over particular or local values. Whereasoral transmissions would be modified as they traveled, written textscan be transmitted intact to groups with different cultural assump-tions. At the same time, rewriting, as in translation, tends to eliminatecultural obstacles in favor of more general features and values. In-deed, things are often written down primarily to enable them to travelbeyond the confines of a particular group. Goody uses this argumentto explain how \"religions of the book\"—such as Christianity, Ju-daism, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism—were able to become world"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Notes  167religions. A good example of this process is provided by Glen Dud-bridge in his close study of successive versions of an Indian Buddhisttale as it came to be transmitted in China (The Legend ofMiao-shan[London: Ithaca Press, 1978]). Watson provides a more ethnographicbut equally effective example in his study of another, not unrelated,goddess (\"Standardizing the Gods\").It has been argued that literacy causes the unarticulated doxa ofa community to give way to the formulation and authority of or-thodoxy. Some scholars suggest that orthodoxy emerges primarily inthe context of a challenge and the ensuing struggle among contendingsets of ideas (John G. Gager, Kingdom and Community: The SocialWorld of Early Christianity [Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall,1975], pp. 76-88). But Goody points out that such a struggle candevelop only when doctrinal points come to be sufficiently fixed andexplicit. In other words, he implies, written materials both makedisagreement possible and make it more than just a very local affair.The social stratification and the universalization of values that allowspluralism result, Goody suggests, in the breakdown of the type ofhomogeneous \"worldview\" associated with tribal cultures and openthe way to the development of \"ideologies\" as the interests of par-ticular groups or classes in the society (Goody, The Logic of Writing,p. 2.2,).Evidence also suggests that the demand for orthodoxy will prevailover a demand for orthopraxy when systems of ideas and practicesspread across ethnically and culturally distinct communities. Localcommunities tend to be more attached to traditional communal prac-tices than to abstract ideas. Since interpretations change more easily,the old practices tend to be reinterpreted. Thus, early Christianityhad to decide whether converted Gentiles should take on the practicesof orthodox Judaism. In the process of formulating what should be\"brought to the Gentiles,\" an expedient emphasis was placed on\"belief\" in Jesus Christ, rather than the dietary and initiatory customsassociated with Hebrew communities quite alien to the Gentiles.Orthodoxy not only may emerge in a struggle over beliefs; it mayalso emerge when an emphasis on belief can effectively unite a largercommunity embracing many local traditions of praxis. According tothis reasoning, Christianity sought to evangelize without necessarilydestroying local community, which was a pattern in the spread ofBuddhism as well. The issue of local rites is a very interesting one inthe history of the spread of Christianity, and for the most part thespirit was one of accommodation.

This third part engages yetanother fundamental query: When and why do the strategies ofritualization appear to be the appropriate or effective thing to do?The standard approach to the issue implied by 'when and whyritual?' has tended to look at how ritual functions as an instrumentof social control. The type of social control thought to be wieldedby ritual has been envisaged in a variety of ways. For some it is amatter of mental indoctrination or behavioral conditioning, eitherthrough repetitive drills or the effective states induced by groupenthusiasm.1 Others have emphasized the cognitive influence of the'modeled' and 'idealized' relations by which ritual defines what isor should be.1 Hence, the emphasis is sometimes on the effect ofcommunal ritual on individual psychology, at other times on ritual'srole in structuring interactive relationships. These theoretical de-scriptions of how ritual constitutes a form of social control fre-quently overlap with other theories concerning the role of ritual ineffecting social change or social conformity. One recent study ofpolitical rituals points out that ritual attends conservative politicsof 'reaction' as well as the potentially transformative politics of'revolution.'3 How ritual practices can serve both social control andsocial change is a fitting conundrum with which to launch thediscussion here.Paralleling the arguments of the previous two parts, I will firstanalyze some of the impetus for approaching ritual as a mechanismof social control and suggest how the discourse that emerges comes169"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"i yo  Ritual and Powerto be unduly constrained and closed. Second, using the approachto ritualization developed in Part II, I will build upon some alter-native understandings of social dynamics to delineate a relationshipbetween the strategies of ritualization and the construction of par-ticular types of power relations. In brief, it is my general thesis herethat ritualization, as a strategic mode of action effective withincertain social orders, does not, in any useful understanding of thewords, 'control' individuals or society. Yet ritualization is verymuch concerned with power. Closely involved with the objectifi-cation and legitimation of an ordering of power as an assumptionof the way things really are, ritualization is a strategic arena forthe embodiment of power relations. Hence, the relationship of ri-tualization and social control may be better approached in termsof how ritual activities constitute a specific embodiment and exerciseof power."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"7Ritual ControlDurkheim's model of ritual underlies four influential theses con-cerning ritual as a means of social control: the social solidaritythesis, the channeling of conflict thesis, the repression thesis, andthe definition of reality thesis. Durkheim saw ritual as dramatizingcollective representations and endowing them with a mystical ethosthat in the course of the communal experience did not merely pro-mote acceptance of those representations but also inculcated deep-seated affective responses to them. The simplest form of his model,the social solidarity thesis, suggests that ritual exercises controlthrough its promotion of consensus and the psychological and cog-nitive ramifications of such consensus. In their own ways, RobertsonSmith, Evans-Pritchard, Fortes, and Munn all appealed to this basicfeature of ritual in describing its role in socialization. They arerepresentative of the tendency, as David Kertzer puts it, to see socialsolidarity as \"a requirement of society\" and ritual as \"an indispen-sable element in the creation of that solidarity.\"4Stephen Lukes, among others, has critiqued this social solidarityapproach to the analysis of modern political rituals, particularly asit is enshrined in such classic studies as the Shils and Young inter-pretation of the British coronation ceremony, W. Lloyd Warner'swork on American rituals, Robert N. Bellah on civil religion, andSidney Verba on the media events surrounding the assassination ofJohn F. Kennedy.5 Lukes argues that the Durkheimian notion ofsocial integration and value consensus effected by means of \"col-lective effervescences\" is too simple to deal adequately with thecomplexity and range of political rituals. Lukes goes on to dem-171"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"172,  Ritual and Poweronstrate that collective effervescences do not so much unite thecommunity as strengthen the socially more dominant group througha \"mobilization of bias.\"6 In this way, Lukes emphasizes the politicsof dominance and inequality underlying the group consciousnessforged by ritual, but he does not deny that ritual is uniquely gearedto generate this revised form of solidarity.Although Gluckman and V. Turner both came out of the Durk-heimian tradition, they significantly altered the thrust of its ap-proach to the issue of social control by addressing the ways inwhich ritual deals with conflicts. Their work, which suggests thatritual controls by forestalling overt rebellion or other threats tosocial unity, has given rise to the 'channeling of conflict theory.'Gluckman's studies of \"rites of rebellion\" present ritual as a typeof safety valve that formally arranges the diffusion of social tensionsand personal emotions generated by social conflict.7 \"Tribal ritualsentail dramatization of the moral relations of the group,\" writesGluckman, \"... [and] ritual is effective because it exhibits all thetensions and strife inherent in social life itself.\"8 Lane echoes thisposition in her study of Soviet ritual as a \"tool of cultural man-agement\" and a strategy for maintaining social control.9 In an ex-tension of this approach, Edelman describes ritualization as a meansof preserving strained social relations by simultaneously escalatingand orchestrating conflict in such a way that it has to be and canbe resolved.10V. Turner worked out a detailed description of the way in whichritual concurrently affords the formal structuring that maintainsthe ordered value system of a group as well as a cathartic experienceof communitas, or antistructure. As a dialectic of structure andantistructure, ritual works as a \"mechanism that periodically con-verts the obligatory into the desirable.\" In other words, \"normsand values, on the one hand, become saturated with emotion, whilethe gross and basic emotions become ennobled through contactwith social values. The irksomeness of moral constraint is trans-formed into the 'love of virtue.' \"Ir As with Gluckman's formula-tion, the result is conflict resolution and social equilibrium.Although both Gluckman and V. Turner addressed social andstructural conflicts rather than psychological conflict within indi-viduals, their general approach has tended to direct attention to theindividual as an entity controlled by group processes. Indeed, their"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Ritual Control  173language often parallels that used to describe the phenomenon ofrepression or sublimation in psychological studies.Xi Ultimately, thestruggle between the individual psyche and society is never seen assimply out there in the social arena, but within each person as well.For Durkheim, as we saw in Part I, the person is ultimately seenas two people, \"the material and the spiritual beings who coexistwithin us.\"13 Tapping this psychological dimension, students ofGluckman and Turner are concerned to show how ritual integratesthe social and the individual both externally and internally. Theyare not particularly concerned with Lukes's insight into how ritualforces people to coexist in some relation of domination and sub-ordination. Although these theorists all have some sympathy formore Marxist approaches to social tension, it is the psychosocialdimension in Durkheimian studies of ritual as conflict managementthat keeps the Gluckman-Turner approach quite distinct from thatof Lukes.The psychological overtones accompanying studies of ritual associal control in the Durkheim—Gluckman—V. Turner lineage havealso been developed quite explicitly and independently of the con-straints of a social theory, notably in the work of Rene Girard andWalter Burkert, among others. Girard and Burkert focus, for ex-ample, on ritual sacrifice as controlling, channelling, and finallyrepressing human violence so as to allow for ordered social life.14Using Freudian notions of desire, guilt, and an original murder atthe hands of the group, Girard's La Violence et le sacre presents atheory of ritual sacrifice as the central act of a cultural systemgenerated by primal violence. Sacrifice, as the ritualized killing ofsubstitutes, is itself a substitute for the violence that continuallythreatens to consume society.15 Burkert's Homo Necans similarlyargues that the irrational activities of sacrifice that are preserved atthe core of Greek religion and civilization derive from the rituali-zation of the hunt in pre-Greek society. His theory of the ritualizedhunt also accounts for the subsequent emergence of myth, religion,and civilization.16Drawing on ethological as well as psychological models, Girardand Burkert both conclude that ritualization is the controlled dis-placement of chaotic and aggressive impulses. Hence, ritualizationis central to culture as the means to dominate nature and the naturalviolence within human beings. Although ritual (= culture) is the"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"174  Ritual and Powernecessary repression of this violence (= nature), culture still remainsdependent upon the energy of aggression as well as its restraint.17This perspective is taken further in Heesterman's study of Vedicritual, The Inner Conflict of Tradition. Heesterman argues that ina preclassical age in ancient India, there was a sacrificial cycle ofraids, contests, and battles marked not only by its violence but alsoby a sense of the paradox of killing for the sake of giving life. Then,in a type of cultural breakthrough comparable to Burkert's ritual-ization of the kill, the chaos of the sacrificial cycle was transformedinto the transcendent, static, and absolute order of Vedic ritual.18The result, as B. K. Smith points out, is a contrast between thesanitized, perfected world of ritual and the risk, violence, and dis-order of sacrifice—the virtual differentiation of the violence of sac-rifice from the cultural control of ritual.19 In the end, forHeesterman, ritual structure is totally repressive: instead of chan-neling violence, the order of ritual completely denies it.Valeri points to the traditional gulf between anthropology andpsychology in a brief critique of Girard's assumption that violenceis a 'pure' psychological process independent of culture but stillgenerative of and controlled by cultural activities like ritual.10 Intheir concern to track the rise of human culture from its roots innature, understood simply as barbaric, violent, and generally an-ticultural and antihuman, such psychological approaches end uppositing metacultural forces that nonetheless direct and shape cul-ture. Valeri's anthropological approach, of course, recognizes noth-ing outside of or before culture. Yet even ethological studies wouldtake issue with such a Freudian interpretation of the emergence ofsocial behaviors. In a discussion of successive theories of ritualamong phenomenologists and historians of religions Burton Mackunwittingly chronicles just how slow a process it has been for thesescholars to come to see ritual in any truly social or cultural context.21While Girard's and Burkert's theories have their sympathizers, inactual fact few theorists of ritual pursue the 'repression thesis' ap-proach any longer. Those attracted to the scientific aspects of psy-chology are now more likely to embrace the 'scientism' ofethological and ecological frameworks, where Burkert also gravi-tates. Yet those interested in discussing the issues raised by theo-logians in terms other than those of theology still find psychologicallanguage useful. For example, in an introduction to a volume of"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Ritual Control  175papers on sacrifice from both anthropologists and theologians,Fortes resorts to such psychological theories in an attempt to redressthe \" 'embarrassed silence' of anthropologists on 'the relationshipbetween the effects of rituals and what participants expect to achievethrough them.' \" He suggests that the \"universal infantile experi-ence of helpless dependency\" gives rise to \"rituals of defense\"against \"the inescapable vulnerability of humanity.\"22 As Valeri'scritique goes on to imply, however, it is contradictory to see indi-vidual psychological processes as the source of social institutionsthat reflect and control these psychological experiences but are neverable to ameliorate them. To approach cultural rituals as rooted inpurely psychological conflicts—as opposed to the Gluckman— V.Turner approach to social rites and social conflicts—is to see ritualas an oppression inherently necessary to society, which is definedin turn as the repression of the individual.Whereas the repression thesis emphasizes how ritual exercisescontrol over the individual's affective state, the fourth approach,the definition of reality thesis, focuses on how ritual models idealrelations and structures of values. Examples of this approach in-clude the work of Geertz, T. Turner, Douglas, and Lukes. Theytend to see ritual as a symbolic modeling of the social order, withthis imaging or iconic quality as the basis of its efficacy.23 It issignificant, however, that these theorists do not explicitly addresshow ritual 'controls' but how it 'defines' social norms and presentsthem for internalization. Lukes, for example, urges that more at-tention be given to the cognitive over the affective dimensions ofritual, and to the type of power that ritual exercises in this way.Ritual, he argues, \"helps to define as authoritative certain ways ofseeing society: it serves to specify what in society is of special sig-nificance, it draws people's attention to certain forms of relation-ships and activity—and at the same time, therefore, it deflects theirattention from other forms, since every way of seeing is also a wayof not seeing.\"24Geertz explores this more cognitive direction particularly in hisstudy of Balinese kingship where ritual is no longer seen in thedirect service of social solidarity but in the service of 'reality.'25 Hesuggests that the ability to define an order as 'the real' in both itsinternal structure and its limits is a form of control that is notexperienced as such by the people involved. That is, culture uses"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"176  Ritual and Powerritual to control by means of sets of assumptions about the waythings are and should be.z6 The invisibility of ritual in naturalizingassumptions about the nature of reality denotes in part the basisof its effectiveness. Others, however, call attention to the fact thatritual activities are not the preeminent or only forms of invisiblecontrol. Similarly imperceptible control is exercised by such simpleand conventional admonishments as \"be respectful to elders.\"17 ForBourdieu, as we noted earlier, a whole cosmology is communicatedin the injunction to \"stand up straight!\" The trick of such socialpedagogy lies in how \"it extorts the essential while seeming todemand the insignificant.\"2\"8In the main, proponents of the definition of reality thesis seek tofind in ritual a single central mechanism for the communication ofculture, the internalization of values, and the individual's cognitiveperception of a universe that generally fits with these values. Thosewho diverge from the more mechanistic aspects of this approach,like Bloch and Bourdieu, tend to treat ritual as a particular instanceof a larger category of strategic practices characterized by formal-ization. While the definition of reality thesis improves on the pre-ceding three models by reworking them in terms of a more subtleunderstanding of social control, it continues the tendency to seerite as a nearly magical mechanism of social alchemy by which theirksomeness of human experience is transformed into the desirable,the unmentionable, or the really real.19 This type of focus on ritualobscures a very basic issue, namely, the particular types of socialarrangements in which ritual activities are an effective way of de-fining reality. No matter which definition of ritual is used, it isobvious that not every society or subgroup appeals to ritual activ-ities in the same way and to the same degree. Hence, any theoryof ritual as social control must also specify what type of society orcommunity is likely to depend heavily on this form of control andwhy.Proponents of the first three theses—the solidarity thesis, thechanneling of conflict theory, and the repression thesis—are likelyto respond to this issue by equating ritual modes of control withhomogeneous tribal societies and so-called legal modes with tech-nologically developed and socially diverse societies. At the sametime, they are very responsive to the presence of ritual forms ofcontrol in special areas of technological societies, as various studies"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Ritual Control  177by V. Turner, Lukes, and Douglas among others readily demon-strate. In contrast, proponents of the definition of reality thesis tendto back away from any polarization of traditional and modernsocieties. Concerned with delineating a specifically cultural level ofanalysis, they are reluctant to appear too dependent upon a levelof sociological analysis. Nonetheless, they have failed to find analternative way of appreciating the problem of ritual context.Typologies and HierarchiesVarious attempts have been made to see how a dependence onritualized activities for social cohesion and control correlates withmodes of social organization. Bourdieu, for example, notes thatritual assumes a fair degree of consensus, whereas legalistic rulesof law and order assume much less. Yet he adds, somewhat con-tradictorily, that increased ritualization accompanies increased dis-tance between groups that would appear to have little basis forconsensus.30 Gluckman, in much more detail, describes ritualizationas a feature only of high-consensus small-scale societies where, inthe context of relatively undifferentiated social relations, conflictsdeveloped among overlapping groups and organizations. \"Personsare intricately involved with the same sets of fellows in varied sys-tems of purposive activity,\" he writes. \"Cross-cutting allegiancesand processes of internal development within sets of relations es-tablish ambivalence and conflict within each group. Ritual cloaksthe fundamental disharmonies of social structure by affirming majorloyalties to be beyond question.\"31 Gluckman finds that ritualiza-tion is not important in highly differentiated societies since suchsocieties not only segregate roles but also segregate conflicts.3i Indifferentiated societies other \"mechanisms of redress\" operate asalternatives to the ritual mechanisms used in tribal societies.33 Hedoes not develop this line of reasoning, however, and many studiesof modern ritual in industrial societies appear to apply Gluckman'stribal-based theory of ritual without worrying about thesedistinctions.34Douglas has advanced a very systematic framework for under-standing both the degree and the style of ritual in various types ofsocieties. She suggests that ritualization correlates with and con-"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"178  Ritual and Powertributes to the restraining effect of closed and highly structuredsocieties.35 Using Basil Bernstein's work on linguistic codes, Douglasargues that particular ritual patterns or styles encode and therebypromote particular social patterns. In other words, symbolic sys-tems such as ritual both realize and regulate the structure of socialrelations. Like forms of speech, forms of ritual are \"transmitters ofculture, which are generated in social relations and which, by theirselections and emphases, exercise a constraining effect on socialbehavior.\"36 Within this framework, Douglas goes on to indicatethe relationship of highly elaborate ritual systems on the one hand,or highly secularized antiritual activities on the other, to particularforms of social structure. As she notes, this framework makes aradical break from the reasoning that connects secularism withmodernity and ritualization with tribal society. Hence, Douglasapproaches secularization as the loosening of social ties, and shefinds it among industrialized nations as well as the Ituri pygmies,the Basseri nomads, and the Nuer and Dinka of the Sudan.37 Sheconcludes, therefore, that ritual is important in societies that are(i) closed social groups with (2.) restricted codes of linguistic andsymbolic communication, in which (3) there is great emphasis onhierarchical position as opposed to personal identity and (4) yet ageneral social consensus still upholds the system. Her charting ofthese characteristics as degrees of grid and group to create fourtypical societies is well known.38Based on Douglas's analysis, then, ritual is an important andeffective means of social control in only certain types of societies,namely, closed and hierarchical ones. Such societies must have amarked hierarchical structure of differentiated positions as well asa strong sense of corporate identity, both evidenced in an assump-tion that interpersonal relations should be subordinated to the or-dering of roles or positions. The group is simultaneously both highlydifferentiated and exalted as a corporate unity above the interestsof the self.39 The centrality of a marked social hierarchy to ritualpractice, as we saw in Part II, has been suggested by a number ofwriters. Leach argues that ritual is customary behavior, almost aform of speech, which makes statements about the hierarchicalrelations among people.40 Bloch suggests that ritual, as formaliza-tion, is an effective form of power in those societies in which tra-ditional authority, in the Weberian sense, dominates. Such societies,"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Ritual Control  179he adds, tend to be \"oppressively hierarchical.\"41 Valeri suggeststhat it is hierarchy, as the structuring of people, gods, and rites,that is the fundamental criterion for the efficacy of any sacrifice.He sees hierarchy itself as the essential and immediate context ofritual.4*Despite this form of support, Douglas's system has also beensubject to some criticism. John Comaroff raised the problem oftypologies in general—that they merely promote simple exercisesin classification. They are of little value, he maintains, unless usedto explore the ongoing utilization and control of both restrictedand elaborated codes in relation to each other.43 A more immedi-ately pertinent problem arises in Douglas's description of exactlyhow ritual encodes, realizes, promotes, and regulates social rela-tionships. She uses the imagery of a ritual juxtaposition of twobodies, the social body and the physical body. Attitudes to the bodyare a key to the system of ordering that pervades every aspect of asociety, she argues, and are immediately reflected in the styles ofritual and cosmological formulations. On the one hand, \"the socialbody constrains the way the physical body is perceived.\" On theother hand, \"the physical experience of the body, always modifiedby the social categories through which it is known, sustains a par-ticular view of society.\" Hence, \"there is a continual exchange ofmeanings\" between these two bodies \"so that each reinforces thecategories of the other.\"44 Ultimately, however, and very much inthe spirit of Durkheim, Douglas does not see these two bodies asfully integrated. She merely concludes that \"sometimes they are sonear as to be almost merged; sometimes they are far apart. Thetension between them allows the elaboration of meanings.\"45While Douglas provides a brilliant exploration of the way inwhich natural symbols and rituals play upon an isomorphism ofthe personal body and its larger (macrocosmic) contextual spheres,she also reduces these dynamics to the operation of a simple Durk-heimian tension between self and society. Elsewhere Douglas al-ludes to a more complex dynamic, one that seeks the systemiccorrelation of levels of meaning among the body, society, and thecosmos.46 Yet in the end Douglas's notion of the social body is oneof the ways in which her social functionalism grants priority tosociety and a sociological level of analysis. V. Turner, in contrast,attempted to break out of this functionalism by arguing the op-"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"i8o  Ritual and Powerposite: that the body is primary, the fons et origo of all socialclassification.47 However, the main point is not which is primaryin some absolute sense, but rather whether the supposed primacyof one or the other, or simply their strategic correlation, is importantto ritualization.Douglas makes several points that are worth underscoring here.First, ritualization, as a particularly effective strategy of social ac-tion, is correlated with closed and hierarchical societies. Second,the efficacy of ritualization is seen to operate at least in part throughthe physical interaction (projection and embodiment) of the per-sonal body with symbolically structured social schemes, whichcould be the social body for Durkheim or the projected 'environ-ment' discussed in Part II. This interaction collapses, orders, andnuances social and cosmic relations. Where Durkheim saw twobodies juxtaposed, Douglas sees two involved in the mutual con-stitution of each other. As I suggested earlier, it is the unrecognizedprimacy of the body in a ritualized environment that distinguishesritualization from other social strategies. Third, Douglas also dem-onstrates that despite its importance in particular types of societies,ritual has no intrinsic priority as a social strategy in establishingand maintaining such a society. Rather it works in concert withmany other forms of activity and types of attitudes. Hence, ritual-ization is not a single-handed method or mechanism of social con-trol; it is one of several ways of reproducing and manipulating thebasic cultural order of a society as it is experienced by, embodiedin, and reproduced by persons.Although Douglas's functionalism, which privileges the moldingeffect of the social body upon the personal body, sometimes appearsa bit doctrinaire, it is a useful contrast to the intellectualism ofValeri's approach to how ritual defines reality. He argues that \"thereproduction of Hawaiian society requires the reproduction of theconcept of man on which this society is based.\"48 This concept,which \"is embodied by the totality of the gods that appear in ritual,\"is particularly condensed in the Haku 'ohi'a, a piece of wood carvedinto human form and transformed into the god Ku. This image is\"the most encompassing ritual symbol created by the Hawaiians\"and its reproduction in ritual \"has, or should have, the effect ofreproducing the concept that the image represents.\" That is, as anobjectification of the society's concept of human beings, the image"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Ritual Control  181both symbolizes society and \"reconstitutes\" it.49 Valeri goes on toexplain that the ritual communication of such a concept differsfrom linguistic communication since the former plays on ambiguityto produce \"model experiences\" whose underlying codes are in-ferred and mastered. Ritual, he argues, is a matter of \"programmedlearning through activities that involve the apperception of codes,principles, concepts and their reproduction in practice, in action.\"50From their different starting points, Douglas and Valeri convergewith an implicit recognition that the social control wielded by ritualis a more complex phenomenon than the manipulation of affectivestates or cognitive categories. One needs to ask, first, how ritualeffects the embodiment of principles for an ordering of reality and,second, how this embodiment works within and is generative ofhierarchical and/or closed societies. Yet the more complex phenom-enon suggested by these questions also implies the limits of thenotion of social control per se. In the sections that follow I willwork out an alternative interpretation of the social functions ofritual, namely, how the strategies of ordering and reproductionembodied through ritualization relate to the larger question of theorganization of power relations in a society. Hence, I will attemptto demonstrate that ritual does not control; rather, it constitutes aparticular dynamic of social empowerment. To generate and estab-lish this interpretive framework, I need to engage several other issuesbasic to how we have conceived ritual, namely, belief, ideology,and legitimation. Reconceiving the dynamics at stake in these formsof social phenomena makes it possible to reconceive ritualization."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"8Ritual Belief, and IdeologyThe study of ritual has always assumed the close association of ritewith belief. As we have seen, ritual has generally been thought toexpress beliefs in symbolic ways for the purposes of their continualreaffirmation and inculcation. This relationship is particularlyprominent in theories of ritual as a form of social control. Hence,any attempt to leave behind the notion of ritual as an ideologizingmechanism for transforming ideas into sentiments and sentimentsinto significance, to paraphrase V. Turner and Geertz, will requirea new analysis of the nature of belief and its relationship to ri-tualization. In the following sections I will argue that the projectionand embodiment of schemes in ritualization is more effectivelyviewed as a 'mastering' of relationships of power relations withinan arena that affords a negotiated appropriation of the dominantvalues embedded in the symbolic schemes. To analyze the relation-ship of ritualization to belief, therefore, I will focus on the tensionand struggle involved in this negotiated appropriation, rather thanon the production of doctrines neatly internalized as assumptionsabout reality.Ambiguous Symbols and Unstable BeliefsReligious beliefs have been understood in a variety of ways—aspseudoscientific explanations, rationalizations of customary behav-ior, personal or communal ideologies, or highly structured doctrinalformulations whose content has little import on behavior. When181"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Ritual, Belief, and Ideology  183defined in terms of the mental states of individuals, belief has beendeemed beyond the reach of social analysis.51 Yet belief has alsobeen described as irreducibly social in nature, a matter of collectivelysignificant activities rather than personally held concepts or atti-tudes.52 More frequently, belief systems are understood to be amatter of cultural worldviews or communally constructed ideolog-ical systems, quite beyond what a particular person may or maynot hold to be true.53 Martin South wold combines these last twopositions by distinguishing between those religious tenets that aresubject to question or doubt and those that are not. The lattergroup, he suggests, are empirically indeterminant, axiomatic, sym-bolic, and collective by necessity.54 They are simultaneously sym-bolic actions that define reality and a mode of discourse thatinterprets experiences of reality.55 \"Contrary to the conventionalwisdom concerning our own religious history,\" he remarks, \"areligion comes to be rejected not as simply false but rather as in-appropriate or unfitting.\"56The traditional association of belief and ritual is also challengedby growing evidence that most symbolic action, even the basicsymbols of a community's ritual life, can be very unclear to par-ticipants or interpreted by them in very dissimilar ways. Fernandez'swork on the Fang cult is the most well-known example of thedifferent ways in which ritual symbols can be understood by par-ticipants. Yet he argues that despite the different \"cultural\" inter-pretations attached to them, such symbols still promote \"social\"solidarity.57 This suggests that some level or degree of social con-sensus does not depend upon shared information or beliefs, andritual need not be seen as a simple medium of communicating suchinformation or beliefs.58 Indeed, for Fernandez, ritual forms of sol-idarity are usefully promoted because they rarely make any inter-pretation explicit; that is, they focus on common symbols, not onstatements of belief. Although this distinction between what is cul-tural (interpretations, beliefs) and what is social (activity, ritual)remains problematic, Fernandez's conclusion that ritual does notappear to communicate common understandings of its central sym-bols is very significant.59Evidence for the diversity of interpretations and beliefs amongmembers of small ritual communities is also supported by the find-ings of Jordan in a Taiwanese village and Peter Stromberg in a small"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"184  Ritual and PowerSwedish church.60 Another study of Taiwanese sectarian groups byJordan and Daniel Overmyer goes even further in challenging thenotion of a social consensus effected by ritual. Like Fernandez, theauthors found that most members of the sectarian communitieswere \"simultaneously both believers and skeptics\"; unlike Fernan-dez, they suggest that this very ambivalence has a positive effect onthe constitution of the religious community.61 In his study of theforms of the cult of the Taiwanese goddess Matsu, Watson con-cludes that the genius of Chinese policies for national unity lay intheir imposition of ritual structures (form), not dogmatic beliefs(content). Like Jordan and Overmyer, he points to the importanceof ambiguity in ordering and unifying diverse groups.6z This evi-dence suggests that symbols and symbolic action not only fail tocommunicate clear and shared understandings, but the obvious am-biguity or overdetermination of much religious symbolism may evenbe integral to its efficacy.63As with ritual, most attempts to analyze how symbols do whatthey do also assume that the purpose of symbolism is socioculturalsolidarity by means of the naturalization of political and ideologicalvalues. In a pattern that will be familiar to the reader by now, thesetheoretical descriptions first distinguish categories of experience inorder subsequently to show how symbols collapse these categoriesto afford an experience of participation or integration. For example,when Abner Cohen addresses the ambiguity of symbols, he findstheir \"multidimensionality\" to be essentially a bivocal structureaddressing existential ends on the one hand and political ends onthe other.64 Also with regard to the ambiguity of symbols, V. Turneridentified the symbol as the smallest unit of ritual and, therefore,the smallest 'mechanism' of the transformation and integration ef-fected in ritual. Similar to Cohen's distinction between the existen-tial and political dimensions of symbols, Turner distinguishedsensory and ideological poles. Then, in regard to the transformativeeffect of ritual, he described an interchange between these poles bywhich one experiences (or senses) the ideological as the real.65 Al-though these analyses succumb to the pattern of ritual theory cri-tiqued in Part I, they attempt to identify the ambiguity of ritualsymbolism and deem such ambiguity to be essential to ritual.In addition to the evidence for the fundamental ambiguity ofsymbols, there is also evidence that religious beliefs are relatively"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Ritual, Belief, and Ideology  185unstable and unsystematic for most people. Instead of well-formulated beliefs, most religions are little more than \"collectionsof notions.\"66 Philip Converse demonstrated this point quite graph-ically in a study of belief systems among elites in contrast to suchsystems among the mass public.67 With regard to political beliefs,he found that systems of ideas, beliefs, or ideological attitudes donot filter down much beyond the class of professionals who dealwith them on a regular basis.68 Among the public at large, beliefsand opinions become increasingly incoherent with each other as thelevel of sophistication and education decreases. That is to say, beliefsor attitudes are increasingly less constrained by logic on the onehand while becoming more affected by local group interests on theother. The dissociation of logically related ideas proceeds down thesocial ranks to such an extent that it is impossible to find anysignificant public participation in the belief systems found amongelites.69 In addition, nonsystematic clusters of ideas, so much moreprevalent than wide-ranging systems of beliefs, show great insta-bility over even short periods of time. Converse concluded thatthe factors affecting the juxtaposition of beliefs were most likelyto be social (group affiliations), then psychological (expressiveof individual idiosyncratic orientations); the logical coherenceof beliefs was the least likely factor to affect which beliefs werejuxtaposed.70In contrast to the evidence on beliefs, however, Converse foundthat even poorly educated adherents of different creeds, people whohad little in the way of a coherent belief system and no grasp oftheological conceptions, still tended to have a \"fairly accurateknowledge of concrete matters of ritual and mundane taboos.\"71This point may supply the more appropriate framework for as-sessing the experiences, noted in Part I, that Singer had with thebrahmins of Madras. The fact that they responded to his abstractgeneralizations about Hinduism with an invitation to view a par-ticular ceremony should not be taken as evidence of the fact thatsuch a ceremony contains and expresses the essential whole of Hin-duism. Rather, 'Hinduism' existed for those brahmins only in termsof such activities. Hinduism for Hindus is not a coherent beliefsystem but, first and foremost, a collection of practices. It is thecollection of practices as such that needs to be explored further inorder to understand their sense of religious action. Converse's con-"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"186  Ritual and Powerelusion about formal beliefs in comparison to particular practicesalso recalls the story of one exasperated foreign missionary in China.He could successfully convince the Chinese that they were foolishto bow to statues, he asserted, only to have them giggle shyly andadmit that they would continue to do it anyway.72Converse's findings support some of the conclusions reached byGoody and Watt's exploration of the ramifications of literacy.Goody and Watt correlate the systematic formulation of beliefs notwith social cohesion or ritual forms of social control but with thestratification of a society and the increasingly more abstract organ-izations of people within it (e.g., as a 'nation' as opposed to avillage). Accompanying the logical and systematic formulation ofbeliefs is a process of universalization, which can render beliefsmuch less able to explain the local and particular in an effectiveway.73 Hence, coherent and shared systems of beliefs will occuramong a relatively small class who specialize in them and will notreadily drift down to be shared by the society as a whole.These studies give evidence for the ambiguity and instability ofbeliefs and symbols as well as the inability of ritual to control byvirtue of any consensus based on shared beliefs. They also suggestthat ritualized activities specifically do not promote belief or con-viction. On the contrary, ritualized practices afford a great diversityof interpretation in exchange for little more than consent to theform of the activities.74 This minimal consent actually contrastswith the degree of conviction frequently required in more day-to-day activities as, for example, the spontaneous sincerity that mustbe conveyed in many forms of conversation. Curiously, Rappaportmakes this type of argument for myth, not ritual. Whereas a ritualspecifies a performer's relationship to what is being performed, henotes, myth does not: one can recite a myth without necessarilybelieving it, but one cannot participate in a ritual without believingit or being perceived as committed to it.75 However, the foregoingarguments suggest that it is exactly this sort of formal and therebynoncommittal participation that ritualized practices do allow.Despite the evidence for the ambiguous, unstable, and inconsis-tent nature of belief systems, recent literature persists in the viewthat ritual has an important social function with regard to incul-cating belief. \"By repetitively employing a limited pool of powerfulsymbols, often associated with emotional fervor,\" writes Kertzer,"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Ritual, Belief, and Ideology  187\"rituals are an important molder of political beliefs.\"76 He arguesthat the shared activities of ritual effect this molding of belief, whilepublic identification with a group reinforces the individual's at-tachment to the group.77 Although Kertzer regards ritual as a rel-atively straightforward mechanism for social solidarity, thatsolidarity is seen to derive not from the formulation and commu-nication of coherent beliefs held in common by participants butfrom the activities of ritual per se. Despite this useful shift of em-phasis, however, Kertzer's analysis still relies on Durkheim's culticchemistry of public avowals and emotional reinforcement.IdeologyAccording to the preceding arguments, ritual does not necessarilycultivate or inculcate shared beliefs for the sake of solidarity andsocial control, although this is a common understanding of ritual.Even without invoking the issue of specific beliefs or beliefs systems,many have seen the activities and effects of ritual in terms of sometype of ideological conditioning. This perspective is based, of course,on a fairly simplistic understanding of ideology (as was the casewith belief) and the persistent notion that social solidarity is thegoal of any and all ritual mechanisms. Undoubtedly, however, thisperspective reflects other forces in scholarship as well, including,perhaps, a distrust of organized religion and the general antiri-tualism of our culture, both features correlating with the grid/groupcharacteristics of American society. Indeed, religion and religiousbeliefs have been a historically consistent starting point for the studyof ideology.78 Well before Marx critiqued religion as the ideologicalopiate of the people, religion had been used as an important fore-runner of the critical notion of ideology.79 Given its background inrelation to ritual and to religion, it is worth reviewing and reas-sessing the notion of ideology.While Marxist uses of the term have varied significantly and beensubject to continual redefinition, basic orientations toward the no-tion of ideology are similar to those I previously reviewed for be-lief.80 On the one hand, ideology has been seen in terms of theneutral perspective of a cultural worldview, the body of ideas, val-ues, and assumptions fundamental to a society and shared by all"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"18 8  Ritual and Powermembers. On the other hand, ideology has also been cast in a morecritical perspective as sets of doctrines promoted by the dominantsocial group because those doctrines support their interests over theinterests of other groups in the society. In the former view, ideology-as-worldview, the tendency is to envision ideology as a single, rel-atively unarticulated system common to all and indispensable tosocial solidarity.81 In the latter view, that of ideology-of-the-dominant-class, however, the emphasis is on a more limited set ofideas that reflects the divisions of society, serving solidarity insofaras it stabilizes the domination of one group over another.When used to describe a single embracing and unarticulatedworldview, the term 'ideology' has been effective in highlightingthree processes: first, the cultural construction of reality as intrinsicto social integration and cohesion; second, socialization (eitherthrough inarticulate forms or fully objectified institutions) as themeans by which values and norms are assumed without question;and third, the \"structuring\" processes of cultural reproduction dis-played in the realm of ideas, beliefs, and values as well as the realmsof economics or politics. Thus, ideology-as-worldview has nuancedthe notion of 'culture' to suggest something less benign, passive, orepiphenomenal.8iCriticism of the ideology-as-worldview perspective focuses pri-marily on its 'totalistic fallacy,' the assumption that a group isdominated by a single, holistic set of ideas, which acts as the cementfor the society. For both Durkheimian functionalists and structuralMarxists, ideology has been conceived as a universal dimension ofsocial life and central to social cohesion.83 Yet the desire to accountfor social cohesion and the reproduction of society has promotedthe notion of a single dominant ideology that ensures unified socialreproduction even through various means of mystification.84 Re-cently, however, it is being more widely argued that ideology is nota single dominant set of ideas and values, and ideologies do notoperate through single ideas or symbols.85The second understanding of ideology, as dominant class inter-ests, is also problematic. It simultaneously casts ideology as self-conscious and articulate, but also 'false' and able to dominatethrough mystification. Although he does not allude to Converse'sfindings, J. G. Merquior similarly suggests that functionalists andMarxists alike have exaggerated the degree to which various social"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Ritual, Belief, and Ideology  189mechanisms can imprint specific attitudes upon the minds of thesubordinate classes. He takes Althusser to task for his notion of aone-way process by which the elites ideologize to control the massesand he challenges the \"crystallization bias\" that assumes an ide-ology to be fully articulated and self-conscious.86 Others have ar-gued that a single, holistic ideology reflecting the interests of justone class completely exaggerates the coherence and consensus ofideological discourse. Moreover, an ideology can scarcely be con-sidered a matter of false images since as a discourse it operatesthrough language, a medium of social action and constitutive ofwhat is real.87 Ultimately, the dominant-class perspective on ide-ology has been challenged by the familiar question \"Exactly howdoes ideology do what we say it does, make people internalize valuesthat do not benefit them?\"88For Merquior this question is unanswerable because of the as-sumptions on which it is based. First, dominated classes rarelyinternalize the values of the dominant class in any simple way. Atbest, they accept or consent to the values of the dominant class,which is quite different from belief in the legitimacy of those val-ues.89 John B. Thompson makes a similar point: consent may begiven to a coherent dominant value system until a coherent alter-native view is worked out, but such consent is not an internalizationof these values or even the acceptance of them as legitimate.90 Hequestions whether social reproduction really requires consensusconcerning dominant values, suggesting that it does not. Socialstability and reproduction may just as plausibly depend upon \"per-vasive fragmentation of the social order and proliferation of divi-sions among its members.\" For example, reproduction of the socialorder may depend less upon a consensus \"than a lack of consensusat the very point where oppositional attitudes could be translatedinto political action.\"91Having critiqued the ideology-as-worldview perspective for itsfalse assumption of a \"holism,\" Merquior finds the same assump-tion to underlie the ideology-of-the-dominant-class perspective.Both imply a holism in their notions of a set of dominant valuespromoted among the subordinate classes or a set of values for thewhole society. Ideologies, even more or less coherent ideas asso-ciated with a more or less coherent social class, are never holistic,he argues. Nor, one might also argue, do they dominate by exer-"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"190  Ritual and Powercising coerced internalization. Ideologies are always factional andas such reduce the scope of any core values.91 In effect, Merquiorattempts to free the notion of ideology from every vestige of 'beliefas a matter of personal conviction.93 Not only is ideology not amatter of belief; in actuality it rarely demands belief. Ideologiesfunction as such by not requiring complete faith in each tenet oridea; all that is required is consent.In opposition to the language of belief and internalization, Mer-quior is building on Gramsci's notions of consent and negotiation.For Gramsci, hegemonic discourse is dialogic not monolithic, de-fined by opposition even when the antagonistic voices are sup-pressed into silence.94 Subordinated classes consent to a\"negotiated\" version of the dominant values when there are noarticulated alternatives. Thus, outside of the dominant class, anideology tends to consist of unexamined assumptions which amountto a \"manipulation of bias\" in favor of the dominant group.95 Asa consequence, ideologies are not primarily for the consumption ofthe exploited classes, but for the internal self-understanding of theclass producing the ideology. In this way, Merquior argues, ideologyis a veil that hides a group from itself, not a mask that threatensand dupes a subordinate group.96 It is necessary to stop seeingideology \"as a vehicle of unanimous legitimacy beliefs\" and beginto \"see it as the instrument of an appropriation of a rhetoric oflegitimacy by power-holding or power-seeking groups.\"97 As a self-deluding and unconscious veiling, ideology connotes power withoutdenoting it; it distorts the image of social reality within a class andsublimates the class's bias.98Bourdieu draws attention to the \"complicity\" of the subordinatedclasses, a complicity necessary to the symbolic domination of ide-ology. This complicity with dominant-class values is neither passivesubmission on the one hand nor free adoption on the other. It isfundamentally an act of misrecognition by which the dominatedclass accepts the legitimacy of the values of the dominant class andapplies the criteria of these values to its own practices, even whendoing so is not favorable to it.99 Bourdieu implies, however, thatthis act of misrecognition is essentially a strategic engagement in astruggle over symbols, a struggle in which contending factions seek\"to impose the definition of the social world most in conformitywith their interests.\"100 Misrecognition is, therefore, not a matter"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Ritual, Belief, and Ideology 191of being duped, but a strategy for appropriating symbols, despitehow structured and structuring the symbols may prove to be inpractice. Indeed, for Bourdieu, it is only in this process of strugglingto appropriate symbols that symbols become the prime instrumentof social integration and consensus.101 There may be no agreementon the symbol and a dramatic degree of variation when any inter-pretation is attempted, as Fernandez found, but still the same sym-bols are a common focus of engagement, a negotiated conflict.Complicity, struggle, negotiation—these terms ali aim to rethinkideology as a lived and practical consciousness, as a partial andoppositional process actively constructed by all involved and takingplace in the very organization of everyday life.IOZ Hence, ideologyis not a coherent set of ideas, statements, or attitudes imposed onpeople who dutifully internalize them. Nor are societies themselvesa matter of unitary social systems or totalities that act as one.103Any ideology is always in dialogue with, and thus shaped andconstrained by, the voices it is suppressing, manipulating, echo-ing.104 In other words, ideologies exist only in concrete historicalforms and in specific relations to other ideologies.105 Similarly, peo-ple do not simply acquire beliefs or attitudes imposed on them byothers. If the manipulation of bias is a matter of unarticulateddispositions (e.g., \"Stand up straight!\"), then these dispositionsmust be embodied and reproduced in many activities that activelysupport them without much contradiction. If the manipulation ofbias is a matter of clear and articulated statements (\"God, guts,and guns made America great!\"), then people have culturally basic'epistemic principles' with which to evaluate and reflect uponideas.106 When they agree, they do not passively follow or obey;they appropriate, negotiate, qualify. Evidence suggests a rich varietyof ways in which people can consent, resist, or manipulate aspectsof dominant ideologies. Subcultures, according to Hebdige and oth-ers, are forms of resistance \"obliquely represented in style\" to besure, but certainly not the passive obedience of people completelyduped.107 In this vein, others have proposed that ideology has noth-ing to do with a state of mind, but rather should be seen as a setof practices that \"foreclose\" the potentially infinite meaning ofvarious cultural elements and relations in determinate ways.108This counter approach to ideology has various ramifications.First, it affects our image of the actor-subject-agent who is both"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"192.  Ritual and Powerembedded in and generative of ideology. The actor emerges as di-vided, decentered, overdetermined, but quite active. He or she isconstituted by structured and structuring dispositions, in Bourdieu'sterms, which yield a variety of strategies, more or less effective inturn at appropriating a redemptive misrecognition of the hegemonicorder.109 This approach has other implications as well. Complicity,struggle, and negotiation all suggest that ideological discourse, nomatter how fractured and plural, does have limits, assumptions,and shared interests. Indeed, as a strategy for not using coercivephysical force, ideology assumes that it will not be met by physicalforce in return. People will recognize their own self-interest in someaspects of its dynamics.110 Ideological strategies are particular formsof power struggling, effective when sheer violence would dissolvethe society, when people are open to the rhetoric of collectivity andunity because it is in their own interests to be so united, or whenreality testing of the values and ramifications of the ideology canremain nonempirical and unaware of the limits within which theyare operating. Utopian in their very nature, Jameson argues, allideologies possess their own kind of truth, a kind of comprehen-sibility within the limits that the ideology defines.111Bourdieu denotes this limited sphere of comprehensibility asdoxa, that which is neither questioned nor known to be known.112\"Every established order,\" he writes, \"tends to produce... the nat-uralization of its own arbitrariness\" by means of a \"play of as-sumptions\" and the sense of limits which constitute the social senseof reality.113 Is this sense of reality the result of the exercise of socialcontrol? Hardly. It is certainly in the interests of people to havesome sense of reality by virtue of which they can live in commu-nication with others. Indeed, it may well be the constraints of com-munity as much as the interests of particular groups that hold ideastogether for the sake of a flexibly unformulated but practicallycoherent worldview, even when that worldview limits, ranks, mar-ginalizes, or frustrates.114Although each pursues independent analyses, Merquior, J. B.Thompson, and Bourdieu similarly conclude that ideology is bestunderstood as a strategy of power, a process whereby certain socialpractices or institutions are depicted to be 'natural' and 'right.'While such a strategy implies the existence of a group or groupswhose members stand to gain in some way by an acceptance of"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Ritual, Belief, and Ideology  193these practices, it also implies the existence of some form of op-position. Thus, ideologization may imply an unequal distributionof power, but it also indicates a greater distribution of power thanwould exist in relationships defined by sheer force. It is a strategyintimately connected with legitimation, discourse, and fairly highdegrees of social complicity and maneuverability.115LegitimationSince Frazer and A. M. Hocart addressed the nature of sacredkingship at the beginning of this century, historians, sociologists,and anthropologists have found the notions of ritual, politicalpower, and the legitimation of that power to be closely interde-pendent.116 It is appropriate, therefore, that several recent analysesof sacred kingship have begun to challenge this interdependence.Geertz's study of Balinese kingship, for example, specifically attacksthe traditional perspective that ritual functions to legitimate theexercise of political power. He argues that such a view casts ritualas mere \"artifice\" designed to disguise the brute exercise of \"real\"power.117 His attempt to break down the distinction between ritualand politics suggests a provocative challenge to the notions of le-gitimation and power.Two stories from Chinese history, retold in Howard Wechsler'sstudy of ritual legitimation in China, illustrate a fundamental di-lemma in understanding the relationship of ritual and politicalpower. The first story tells how the founder of the Han dynasty(2.06 B.c.E.-zzi C.E.) protested when advised that the time hadcome to consult the books on Confucian ethics and ritual. \"All Ipossess I have won on horseback,\" he exclaimed. \"Why should Inow bother with those musty old texts?\" \"Your Majesty may havewon it on horseback,\" retorted his chief counselor, \"but can yourule it on horseback?\"118 In a second story from the T'ang dynastythe perspective shifts and it is not sufficient simply to consult theold books and reenact the ancient rites. Based on his study of thestars and portents, the Grand Astrologer alerted the T'ang emperorto the need to fashion his own distinctive ceremonial. He shouldat least change the calendar, the colors of court dress, and the namesof the government offices so that the people could see the distinct"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"194  Ritual and Powervirtue of his rule.119 An appeal to traditional ritual is necessary tolegitimate the first ruler but insufficient for the second ruler, whoneeded to take tradition in hand and put his stamp on it. Mostsimply, these stories illustrate that the invocation of tradition forthe sake of legitimation is not standardized. They also representanother point. Based on the testimony of historical records, thereare probably few peoples more overt and self-conscious than theChinese in their manipulation of ritual for political ends; at thesame time there is no culture where it would be less appropriate toregard ritual as mere artifice to mask the origins and exercise ofpower.In addressing these paradoxes, Geertz describes how we cling tothe simplistic misconception that power is the imposition of oneperson's or group's will on others through a threat of violence.120Because of this misconception, we rarely escape the associated as-sumption that ritual, as artifice, is there simply to disguise the crudeinstruments of power. In opposing the symbolic to the real, heargues, we see power as only external to its workings.121 Severalsubsequent studies, particularly those by Cannadine and Bloch,have challenged and extended this analysis with a series of usefulquestions.122 If ritual is not merely a mask for power, if it is itselfa form of power, then exactly what form of power is it?123 Andagain, how does ritual do what we keep saying it does: How doesit actually inculcate cultural or political values, converting beliefsabout another world into facts about this one and vice versa, and\"inventing\" traditions even as it purports to be transmittingthem?124These questions reflect a concern to analyze symbols and rites asreal, effective, and powerful, not as simply secondary and expressiveor as mere ideological tools that brainwash by dint of redundantassertions and group enthusiasm. Answers to these questions wouldimpinge upon any approach to the notion of legitimation. Althoughthe common use of the term \"legitimation\" implies a simple op-position of force to artifice or the real to the symbolic, it is generallywell understood that legitimation is one of the powerful things thatritual does. When Reinhard Bendix writes that \"legitimationachieves what power alone cannot,\" he means that rite commandsmore surely than brute physical force.125 Others have explainedlegitimacy as the foundation of any and all political power, since"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Ritual, Belief, and Ideology  195physical coercion can become authority only when 'clothed' (how-ever artificially) in legitimacy.Ii6 Ultimately, concludes one scholarof Chinese history, the social order is maintained not by law at all,but by ritual.117 Certainly, it is in discussing legitimacy as a formof power eclipsing brute force that ritual comes to have great sig-nificance for political analysis.118Three points underlie the attempts by Geertz, Cannadine, andBloch to explain how rituals, especially so-called rituals of legiti-mation, do what they do. First, effective political ritual evokes acomplex cluster of traditional symbols and postures of appropriatemoral leadership, but it orchestrates them to differentiate itself, thisparticular political authority, from what has gone before. Thus,ritual is built out of widely accepted blocks of tradition, generatinga sense of cultural continuity even when the juxtaposition of theseblocks defines a unique ritual ethos.129 Second, rather than affirmingclear and dogmatic values to impress them directly into the mindsof participants, ritual actually constructs an argument, a set oftensions.130 According to Geertz, the Balinese state cult was not acult of the state: \"It was an argument made over and over againin the insistent vocabulary of ritual\" that status in this world isbased on the inherent hierarchical order of the cosmos itself, andtherefore \"the arrangements of human life are but approximations,more close or less, to those of the divine.\"131 Third, ritual does notdisguise the exercise of power, nor does it refer, express, or sym-bolize anything outside itself. In other words, political rituals donot refer to politics, as Geertz has strained to express, they arepolitics. Ritual is the thing itself. It is power; it acts and it actuates.131Geertz argues that to see the power in the political performancesof the Balinese state we must put aside the opposition of symbolicto real, the aesthetic to the practice; we must see power as notexternal to its workings.133 For Cannadine as well, \"Ritual is notthe mask of force, but is itself a type of power.\"134The perspectives of Geertz and Cannadine are in contrast toCohen's formulation that \"power relations are objectified, devel-oped, maintained, expressed, or camouflaged by means of symbolicforms and patterns of action.\"135 While Cohen backs off from main-taining that power is external to these forms and actions, he allowsat least a semantic capitulation to the theoretical primacy or priorityof power by treating symbolic forms and actions as its vehicles,"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"196  Ritual and Powerhowever indispensable.136 Geertz and Cannadine push instead fora recognition of ritual as a strategic form of cultural practice.In sum, it is a major reversal of traditional theory to hypothesizethat ritual activity is not the 'instrument' of more basic purposes,such as power, politics, or social control, which are usually seen asexisting before or outside the activities of the rite. It puts interpretiveanalysis on a new footing to suggest that ritual practices are them-selves the very production and negotiation of power relations. Inthe following chapter I will attempt to demonstrate this alternativeposition more fully by showing how ritualization as a strategic modeof practice produces nuanced relationships of power, relationshipscharacterized by acceptance and resistance, negotiated appropria-tion, and redemptive reinterpretation of the hegemonic order."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"9The Power of RitualizationThe argument of this chapter is essentially a simple one: ritualizationis first and foremost a strategy for the construction of certain typesof power relationships effective within particular social organiza-tions. I will attempt to develop a fuller description of the strategyof ritualization in order to return to the question with which PartIII began, Why and when is ritualization an appropriate and effec-tive way of acting? This question and its answer should be under-stood as an alternative to the view that ritual is a functionalmechanism or expressive medium in the service of social solidarityand control. A focus on activity itself as the framework within whichto understand ritual activity illuminates the complex nature ofpower relations.Theories of PowerAs with 'ritual,' 'belief,' and 'ideology,' the term 'power' has beenvariously constituted for different projects. Fairly standard under-standings involve the positive notion of 'influence' on the one handand the negative notion of 'force' on the other.137 Whereas influenceis understood as inherent, nonspecific, and controlling, force is con-sidered intentional, specific, and threatening.138 Distinctions be-tween power as implicit social control and power as explicit actsof political coercion frequently generate an opposition between so-called symbolic power, associated with ritual and ideology, and so-called secular power, associated with agencies and institutions of197"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"198  Ritual and Powerforce.139 Yet, whether it is formulated as influence or coercion,symbols or weapons, power has consistently been seen as somethingone possesses or not, and something that gives one some form ofcontrol over others (to the benefit of one party and the detrimentof another). This view of power correlates with the tendency to seeideology as a totalistic worldview or a tool of the dominant classes.It also correlates with such traditional notions of religious poweras the Weberian concept of charisma as a personal quality ratherthan a social relationship.140 However, good arguments have alsobeen advanced to support revision of our notion of power to reflectmore accurately how power is constituted by social relationshipsand practices.In a coherent tradition of thinking about power that can be tracedfrom Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan through Lukes's Power: A Rad-ical View, power has been understood on the model of sovereignty:\"Power as a locus of will, as a supreme agency to which other willswould bend, as prohibitory; the classic conception of power as zero-sum; in short, power as negation of the power of others.\" In itsmore subtle and Marxist forms, this approach sees the \"most in-sidious\" exercise of sovereignlike power extend into dominion overindividual subjectivity, giving rise to false consciousness and theunrecognized loss of an autonomous will.141Lukes, for example, has organized some of the more significanttheories of power formulated since Weber and Talcott Parsons interms of various \"dimensions.\"I4Z The first dimension is representedby Robert Dahl's description of power as decision making, personto person in its exercise (as opposed to the 'possession' of power),having mechanical features (as a type of physical coercion), andidentified with situations of overt conflict.143 Peter Bachrach andMorton S. Baratz, representing a second dimension in Lukes's anal-ysis, critiqued Dahl and proposed a broader, four-part typology:power as coercion, as authority, as influence, and as force. Con-sidering both unconscious acts and the failure to act as involvingthe exercise of power, they paid more attention to situations ofcovert conflict.144 Lukes's own \"third dimension\" of power at-tempted to encompass these earlier theories while going beyondthem to address more subtle dynamics of power, such as ideology.Lukes attempted to shift the focus from an emphasis on individualbehavior and observable conflict to a focus on relationships and"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The Power of Ritualization  199structures that control agendas affecting potential issues and latentconflict.145 Roderick Martin formulated a similar notion of poweras fully embedded in the structure of human interactions or socialrelations, not within individual actors or necessarily in situationsof conflict.146These third-dimension approaches have facilitated the elabora-tion of 'symbolic power.' Broadly defined, symbolic power is \"thepower to constitute the given by stating it, to create appearancesand belief, to confirm or transform the vision of the world andthereby action in the world, and therefore the world itself.\"147 Basedon this type of understanding of the order of power in symbolicactivities, Cohen explicitly identifies ideology as a particular strat-egy of power.148 Bourdieu similarly locates power in the boundariesof what can be said and thought, a people's sense of reality, bywhich every social order naturalizes its own arbitrariness.149An alternative understanding of power, which some analysts havetraced back to Machiavelli, appears in the work of Foucault andthose influenced by him.150 For Foucault, power is contingent, local,imprecise, relational, and organizational. In particular, he breakswith the longstanding premise that \"power, whether localised orinvested in a monarch, a community of citizens or a class dicta-torship, consists in some substantive instance or agency of sover-eignty.\"151 He also rejects the notion of a dominant ideologyperpetrated by the ruling class to serve its real interests, a viewsupported by the sovereignty model. For Foucault, power does notexist as a substantive entity that can be possessed or wielded, noris it some 'thing' that exists in historical forms and causal effects.Since these qualities are all implied in a 'theory' of power, Foucaultis determined to avoid theories in favor of an \"analytics ofpower.\"15* Only by staying free of the substantive approach, heimplies, can one truly analyze power in terms of human relations.153He chooses a different language to interpret power as a matter oftechniques and discursive practices that comprise the micropoliticsof everyday life.Foucault defines a relationship of power as a mode of action thatdoes not intend to act directly on persons or things, which is whatviolence does, but indirectly on actions. The exercise of power is\"always a way of acting upon an acting subject or acting subjectsby virtue of their acting or being capable of action.\" It is a matter,"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"zoo  Ritual and Powertherefore, of directing the activity of others, \"guiding the possibilityof conduct and putting in order the possible outcome.\" To govern,as an example of the exercise of power, is \"to structure the possiblefield of action of others.\"154 As a whole structure of actions broughtto bear on other actions, power is constituted by a cluster of re-lations and it simultaneously produces in turn \"a more-or-less-organised, hierarchical, co-ordinated cluster of relations.\"155 Assuch, power relations are deeply embedded in the network of socialrelations and basic, therefore, to any society.156 Or, as Geertz wouldput it, power is not something external to its social workings. Anal-ogous as well to Bloch's revision of Geertz's \"poetics of power,\"Foucault also sees the strategies of power used by kings and gov-ernments as embedded in and dependent upon the level of \"micro-relations\" of power, the local interactions and petty calculations ofdaily life.157At the same time, Foucault argues that relations of power arenot simply engendered from the top down, but from the bottomup as well. On both micro and macro levels, there are always\"movements in the opposite direction, whereby strategies which co-ordinate relations of power produce new effects and advance intohitherto unaffected domains.\"158 Although there are tops and bot-toms, since micropower relations are always unequal, there can beno movement down from the top without a conduit from below.For example, the establishment and maintenance of the power ofkings or the power of capitalism has to be rooted in preexistingforms of behavior, socialized bodies, and local relations of power,which could not be mere projections of the central power and stilleffectively maintain and legitimate that power.159In this way, power is neither an entity external to how and whereit works, nor is it an effect of the confrontation between two op-posed adversaries or a simple dominant-dominated relationship.Indeed, Foucault argues, power is exercised over \"free subjects, andonly insofar as they are free,\" that is, with the option of actingdifferently. If various conditions do away with all options, then itwould no longer be a relationship of power per se.l6° Power andfreedom do not come to a \"face-to-face confrontation\" as mutuallyexclusive states. Their relationship is much more complicated forFoucault. Freedom is the condition, as well as the precondition, forthe exercise of power. Freedom is power's \"permanent support,"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The Power of Ritualization  2.01since without the possibility of recalcitrance, power would be equiv-alent to a physical determination.\"161 In other words, the existenceof freedom (in the sense of accessible options) is necessary to theexercise of power or else what might be thought to be power isreally something much more like the force of necessity. Power mustbe grasped as quite different from the forces of violence or coercion.The necessity of freedom to the exercise of power gives rise toFoucault's understanding of resistance. At the heart of power re-lationships lies an insubordination or resistance, an \"essential ob-stinacy on the part of the principles of freedom,\" which means thatthere can be \"no relationship of power without the means of escapeor possible flight.\"16* Hence, to explore power is to explore a nec-essary and simultaneous resistance to power that continues to pro-voke and legitimize its exercise. \"Every power relationship implies,at least in potentia,\" he writes, \"a strategy of struggle, in whichthe two forces are not superimposed, do not lose their specificnature, or do not finally become confused. Each constitutes for theother a kind of permanent limit, a point of possible reversal.\"163Every power relationship implies the potential for struggle or con-frontation, a confrontation that participants in the relationship mis-takenly think they may win, even though they cannot win andremain (as a winner) within a power relationship. Indeed, everyconfrontation potentially aims at the stabilization of the powerrelation. A power relationship undoes itself when, pushing to quellcompletely the insubordination necessary to it, it succeeds in re-ducing the other to total subservience or in transforming the otherinto an overt adversary.164 For Foucault, therefore, the exercise ofpower is a strategic choice from among ways of interacting and itdepends upon a variety of practices chosen by the parties involvedto maintain the relationship as one of power.In attempting to depict how this type of power is exercised,Foucault consistently chooses the nomenclature of 'ritual' to evokethe mechanisms and dynamics of power. He is not, however, con-cerned to analyze ritual per se or even to generate a description ofritual as an autonomous phenomenon. 'Ritual' is one of severalwords he uses to indicate formalized, routinized, and often super-vised practices that mold the body. He repeatedly refers to \"metic-ulous rituals of power,\" \"liturgies of punishment,\" \"legal\" and\"penal ceremonies,\" and so on.165 In each of his distinct analyses"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"2.O2,  Ritual and Powerof organized relationships of power (his studies of madness, theclinic, punishment, sexuality, etc.), the notion of ritual techniquesis used \"to specify how power works, what it does and how it doesit.\"166 These discussions provide interesting support for the frame-work for understanding ritual activities laid out so far, as well asinteresting evidence of the assumptions about ritualized behaviorthat lead one to link discipline and pagentry, the meticulous andthe routinized. Most significantly, however, Foucault's discussionhelps clarify the purposes of ritualization as an effective way ofacting, namely, how the production of ritualized agents is a strategyfor the construction of particular relationships of power effectivein particular social situations. His contribution in this regard hingeson his appreciation of the centrality of the body.For Foucault, the body is \"the place where the most minute andlocal social practices are linked up with the large scale organizationof power.\"167 The body is a political field: \"Power relations havean immediate hold upon it; they invest it, mark it, train it, tortureit, force it to carry out tasks, to perform ceremonies, to emitsigns.\"168 The body is the most basic and fundamental level of powerrelations, the \"microphysics\" of the micropolitics of power/69 Ri-tualization, Foucault appears to imply, is a central way that poweroperates; it constitutes a political technology of the body.Ritual is basic to Foucault's notion of the constitution and ex-ercise of power simply because of the way in which power involvesthe body and strategy. First of all, power is \"rooted deep in thesocial nexus,\" and the roots of the network of social relations gono deeper than the social body itself. Second, power involves theselection of means to secure an advantage over others. These meansare strategically indirect: they afford an indirect structuring effecton the field of other possible actions.170 For Foucault the term'strategy' implies improvisational, expedient, or the minimum formof rationality needed.171Foucault's analysis of the body and the close workings of poweris an analysis of the strategies by which power relations are putinto play in the very constitution of the social body. He does notdepict the appropriation of the body by something outside it.Rather, the social body is the micronetwork of power relations, butnot in terms of a reflection of larger social institutions or as some"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The Power of Ritualization  2.03sort of social homunculus that contains a blueprint for them. Thesocial body is the active site of \"dispositions, maneuvers, tactics,techniques, functionings,\" it is a \"network of relations, constantlyin tension\" for which the proper metaphor would be a \"perpetualbattle\" rather than \"the conquest of a territory.\"172 He is concernedwith how power relations both penetrate and constitute the bodyin depth, bypassing the subject's own representations, and even anyprocess of internalization in consciousness.173Quite unlike the approach of Douglas described earlier, the socialbody for Foucault \"is the effect not of consensus [or coherence orcontrol] but of the materiality of power operating on the very bodiesof individuals.\"174 The social body—as the shifting network ofpower relations \"between a man and a woman, between the mem-bers of a family, between a master and his pupil, between everyone who knows and every one who does not\"—is, simultaneously,the \"concrete, changing soil\" out of which the sovereigns's poweris constituted and out of which the individual and his or her powerstrategies are constituted.175 Foucault goes so far as to locate thevery generation of individuality, the subject, and subjectivity withinthis network of strategic power relations. \"It is already one of theprime effects of power that certain bodies, certain gestures, certaindiscourses, certain desires, come to be identified and constituted asindividuals,\" he asserts. \"The individual, that is, is not the vis-a-vis of power; it is, I believe, one of its prime effects. The individualis an effect of power, and at the same time, or precisely to the extentto which it is that effect, it is the element of its articulation. Theindividual which power has constituted is at the same time its ve-hicle.\"176 It would be more in keeping with his broader treatmentof power for Foucault to rephrase the sentence just quoted to theeffect that the individual so constituted is not so much a vehicle ofpower as that very microcluster of relations that constitutes poweritself. \"Power constitutes the individual,\" and the individual is theroot of the constitution of power.177Intrinsic to this mutual constitution and maintenance of the in-dividual/social body and the microphysics of power is the freedomand resistance to power mentioned previously. From this angle aswell, the fact that there are no relations of power without resistancemeans that the body is not appropriated by power and neither is"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"204  Ritual and Powerconsciousness.178 Rather, the body and consciousness, and any dis-tinction between them, are constituted by those relations of dom-ination and resistance that are the play of power.179Foucault's analytics of power is a provocative retreatment thathas received much attention and a fair amount of criticism. Whilemany find it not entirely satisfactory to do away with coercion, Iam convinced that his treatment of power as embedded in the socialbodies and interactions of persons opens up an important dimensionof power hitherto underemphasized. In terms of this dimension ofpower, to extend Lukes's list, we can elaborate an analysis of ri-tualization that goes well beyond the social solidarity thesis andsignificantly nuances the definition of reality thesis. The languageof this analytics of power also enables us to begin to answer thequestion of this chapter: Under what general conditions is rituali-zation an effective social strategy? It is in ritual—as practices thatact upon the actions of others, as the mute interplay of complexstrategies within a field structured by engagements of power, as thearena for prescribed sequences of repetitive movements of the bodythat simultaneously constitute the body, the person, and the macro-and micronetworks of power—that we can see a fundamental strat-egy of power. In ritualization, power is not external to its workings;it exists only insofar as it is constituted with and through the livedbody, which is both the body of society and the social body. Ri-tualization is a strategic play of power, of domination and resis-tance, within the arena of the social body.180Ritual Empowerment: Effects and LimitsIt is useful to recapitulate some basics before proceeding further.First, ritualization involves the differentiation and privileging ofparticular activities. Theoretically, these activities may differentiatethemselves by a variety of features; in practice, some general ten-dencies are obvious. For example, these activities may use a delin-eated and structured space to which access is restricted; a specialperiodicity for the occurrence and internal orchestration of the ac-tivities; restricted codes of communication to heighten the formalityof movement and speech; distinct and specialized personnel; ob-jects, texts, and dress designated for use in these activities alone;"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The Power of Ritualization  205verbal and gestural combinations that evoke or purport to be theways things have always been done; preparations that demand par-ticular physical or mental states; and the involvement of a particularconstituency not necessarily assembled for any other activities.These are not universal features, however. At best, ritualization canbe defined only as a 'way of acting' that makes distinctions like theforegoing ones by means of culturally and situationally relevantcategories and nuances. When such culturally specific strategies aregeneralized into a universal phenomenon, much of the logic bywhich these ritual strategies do what they do is lost. This becomesparticularly clear in recalling that the situational and strategic na-ture of ritualization affects even the degree to which such ritualizedacts differentiate themselves at all from other forms of activity. Inother words, an essential strategy of ritualization is how it clarifiesor blurs the boundaries that identify it as a specific way of acting.For example, Wuthnow has explored what he calls the \"ritualaspects\" of left-hand turn signals and the mass viewing of the tele-vision series \"Holocaust.\"181 Given the analysis advanced in thischapter, however, the first case is not one of ritualized activities,merely regularized (rule-bound) behavior that functions as a signalof intentions in the context of driving. Why? The answer is cultural.In this culture, such legally articulated modes of regularized be-havior are insufficient to count as 'ritual' for most people. In thesecond case, the network and general media undoubtedly used avariety of strategies to heighten the sense that people were viewinga unique and profound event, that the television was a medium ofcommunal participation with other viewers for witnessing an im-portant simulation of reality, and to dramatize the solemnity of thebroadcast in contrast to the usual television fare. Indeed, there wassufficient evocation of ritual ways of acting that many people prob-ably reacted with some of the conventions of consent used in rit-ual—\"If it is this unique and important I should watch and accept,\"and the like. Nonetheless, in this culture, viewing the series was notlikely to be judged ritual for those involved due to cultural dis-tinctions among ways of acting, distinctions vital to any analysisof social action.The evocation of ritualizing strategies by activities that do notwish to be considered religious ritual is a very common featureparticularly in the secularism of American society. Courtroom pro-"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"2,06  Ritual and Powercedures and public school graduation exercises, congressional hear-ings and AA meetings—all ritualize to a strategic degree. As a wayof acting that can be put to different purposes, ritualization willsometimes be used to the point of creating certain impressions, butthen stop short of provoking a controversy about its appropriate-ness. For other purposes, usually those of political opposition orartistic experimentation, ritualization will deliberately mime reli-gious symbols and activities in order to create controversy, as in aformal gathering on the steps of the Supreme Court to burn theflag instead of raising it. Hence, cultural and situational forms ofritualization are strategies in the repertoire of any moderately so-cialized person, and one of the most basic of these strategies con-cerns the degree of ritualization used to distinguish or blur activities.The deployment of ritualization, consciously or unconsciously,is the deployment of a particular construction of power relation-ships, a particular relationship of domination, consent, and resis-tance. As a strategy of power, ritualization has both positive andeffective aspects as well as specific limits to what it can do and howfar it can extend. While it may be an effective way of acting incertain places at certain times, under other conditions it may beuseless or counterproductive. It is necessary to explore the rela-tionships of power constituted through ritualization and the cir-cumstances in which these relationships are effective or ineffectiveforms of social interaction.As a strategy for the constitution of power relations that appearsto be 'instinctive' to the socialized agent, ritualization involves twobasic dimensions. The first dimension is that of the dynamics of thesocial body, its projection and embodiment of a structured envi-ronment. Ritualization in this dimension, as we have seen, is aprocess that works below the level of discourse. It produces andobjectifies constructions of power (via the schemes that organizeits environment), which the social agent then reembodies. Ritualizedagents do not see themselves as projecting schemes; they see them-selves only acting in a socially instinctive response to how thingsare. Thus, the production and objectification of structured andstructuring schemes in the environment involve a misrecognition ofthe source and arbitrariness of these schemes. These schemes tendto be experienced as deriving from powers or realities beyond thecommunity and its activities, such as god or tradition, thereby de-"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"The Power of Ritualization  2,07picting and testifying to the ultimate organization of the cosmos.18*The process of objcertification is one in which participants them-selves physically effect the construction of a set of relationships, inthe guise of participating in organizational schemes that appear tobe mandated by the nature of the environment itself. This misre-cognition involves another in turn: participants do not recognizethat the objectified schemes which they reembody have been or-chestrated so that the patterns of dominance and subordinationthey contain generate the sense of integrated totality and embracingholism experienced by the participants. Participants misrecognizeboth the source of the schemes and the changes these schemesundergo in the temporal process of projection and embodiment.These schemes are drawn from each agent's socialized instincts;when objectified they produce an environment that is itself a com-plex pattern, or objectification, of power relations. This structuredand structuring environment that the participants have created andwith which they interact inevitably nuances the disposition ofschemes that each agent repossesses as a practical knowledge of theworld. Relationships of power are drawn from the social body andthen reappropriated by the social body as experience. Specific re-lations of domination and subordination are generated and or-chestrated by the participants themselves simply by participating.Within the intricacies of this objectification and embodiment liesthe ability of ritualization to create social bodies in the image ofrelationships of power, social bodies that are these very relation-ships of power. If it is at all accurate to say that ritualization con-trols—by modeling, defining, molding, and so on—it is this typeof control that must be understood.A second dimension to the ritual construction of power, however,involves dynamics whereby the power relations constituted by ri-tualization also empower those who may at first appear to be con-trolled by them. This second dimension illustrates the actual limitsof most ritual practices as a means of domination and control; itis the flip side of their strategic effectiveness. Integral to the processesof objectification and embodiment described earlier are concomitantprocesses of consent, resistance, and negotiated appropriation. Ina very basic way, one consents to participation by a variety ofinternal discriminations about one's relation to what is going on.A person's involvement in ritual activities—as a particular instance"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"2,o8  Ritual and Powerof his or her involvements with very specific people, groups, places,and events—is never an indiscriminate openness to what is goingon. A participant, as a ritualized agent and social body, naturallybrings to such activities a self-constituting history that is a patch-work of compliance, resistance, misunderstanding, and a redemp-tive personal appropriation of the hegemonic order.The 'consent' that such participation involves cannot be deemeda mere illusion or something artificially manufactured.183 It may bebased in great part on material needs, as the need for employmentwill encourage many to consent to various ritualized activities atthe workplace, or there may be other less material reasons. How-ever, the notion of consent cannot mean 'false consciousness' orideological colonization of the participant's consciousness sincepower as such does not reside outside the relationships constitutedby and constitutive of the participants. 'Resistance' similarly con-stitutes relationships of power in defining participants themselves.A participant pressured to attend a political ritual in a totalitarianstate might assert that her physical presence is consenting to whatis going on, but her mind is resisting. Such participation creates therelations and the very hold of power within her person in terms ofa consenting physical body experienced as distinct from a resistingmind.Just as participation is negotiated, so are the processes of objec-tification and embodiment. Embodiment, like consensual partici-pation in the objectification processes of the rite, is experienced asa negotiated appropriation, not as a total and indiscriminate ab-sorption or social molding. As we have seen, the ritualized agentalready possesses schemes that he or she can deploy, more or lesseffectively, to produce actions that are more or less coherent witheach other and with a larger view of the whole of life. It is by virtueof these schemes that agents also orchestrate and appropriate fortheir own purposes the hegemonic order reconstituted in ritual.They do so in ways that open up for them some personal andprovisional understanding of how the immediate universe worksand how they as individuals fit into it. One appropriates and therebyconstructs a version (usually neither very explicit nor coherent) ofthe hegemonic order that promises a path of personal redemption,that gives one some sense of relative dominance in the order ofthings, and thereby some ability to engage and affect that order.184"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The Power of Ritualization  109When forced into verbal formulations, a person's view of this willprobably not match those of other participants or of specialists.Ritualization, as the interaction of the social body with a structuredand structuring environment, specifically affords the opportunityfor consent and resistance and negotiated appropriation on a varietyof levels.One of the most interesting ethnographies to situate ritual activ-ities within the social organization of power is Jean Comaroff'sstudy of the Tshidi of South Africa before and after colonialization.Although Comaroff does not develop a specific notion of power orthe ritual construction of power relations, she focuses closely onthe role of the body and ritual strategies of resistance within thecontext of political domination. She argues that the body \"me-diates\" all action upon the world: through the schemes of classi-fication inscribed in it, reworked whenever the person needs to beremade, the body effectively constitutes both the self and the uni-verse of which it is a part. Ritual, by focusing on the making andremaking of the body, reproduces the sociopolitical context inwhich it takes place while also attempting to transform it.185Comaroff argues that the imagery of physical affliction and heal-ing so central to the postcolonial ritual practices of the Zionistchurches—in which the body, at war with itself, must be simul-taneously healed and reintegrated into the community—actualizesa position of protest and resistance to the intrusion of the colonialhegemonic order into the Tshidi sense of the natural world. Zionistrituals of baptism and healing construct a social body not as anicon or microcosm of the sociocosmic order, as found in precolonialritual, but as a matter of parts in fractured relation to the whole.In so doing, these rites define a universe that is also afflicted, atwar with itself, but amenable to healing. While such metaphorsaccept the fact of white political dominance and replicate variousdimensions of that power, they simultaneously resist and discouragewholesale acceptance of the order of domination and subordinationpolitically in place in South Africa. The Tshidi reproduce that he-gemonic order by appropriating it in a way that empowers themto envision redemption, to seek healing and domination over theforces of disease and fragmentation.186Comaroff does not look for similar power dynamics of consentand resistance in the precolonial ritual practices of the Tshidi. In-"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"no Ritual and Powerdeed, she tends to see precolonial ritual in terms of a more mon-olithic ideological molding. In contrast to postcolonial practices,precolonial initiation rituals inscribed the hegemonic order withinthe body of the adult and impressed it upon the body of the child.All levels of social experience—body, home, community, and cos-mos—were brought into a reinforcing conformity with each other.In the process, however, symmetrical schemes of complementaryopposition, such as gender relations or the individual vis-a-vis thecollective, were overlaid with asymmetrical schemes of dominancethat emphasized centrism, control, and the authority of the ruler.Comaroff does call attention, in a Geertzian fashion, to a varietyof structural tensions expressed in this overlay of schemes: tensionbetween an unambiguous system of cultural classifications and arather ambiguous network of actual social relations on the onehand, and tension between the social organization and the formsof material production and competition on the other.187 Accordingto the Geertzian formula, she tends to see such tensions mediatedor resolved by their ritual expression, which in precolonial idiomworked to \"reinforce\" the system of so-called natural categories ofthe world, whereas postcolonial idiom worked to \"reform\" or \"re-construct\" them.188 Yet, despite the formula and the tendency tosee a simpler molding process in precolonial ritual, Comaroff'scareful data suggest that the ritual definition and reinforcement ofthe natural order was neither fixed nor nonstrategic.Ritualization both implies and demonstrates a relatively unifiedcorporate body, often leading participants to assume that there ismore consensus than there actually is. It leads all to mistake theminimal consent of its participants for an underlying consensus orlack of conflict, even when some conflict is objectified and reem-bodied. Most of all, ritualization leads participants to mistake thegroup's reformulation of itself as a straightforward communicationand performance of its most traditional values.The misrecognitions of ritualization affect both those who dom-inate and those who are dominated. Moreover, the misrecognitionsthat make ritualization so effective for the creation and maintenanceof certain power relations simultaneously set the limits of rituali-zation's social efficacy. These limits are rooted in several interrelatedfeatures: first, there is the need to presume at least an illusion ofconsensus among participants; second, this involves the necessity"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"The Power of Ritualization  2.11of encouraging or inducing consent, usually by stressing the per-sonal advantages to be had or costs to be incurred by not consenting;and third, to induce the consent of participants by whatever meansalso affords the participants the opportunity to appropriate and/orresist in negotiated ways.Although it is difficult to address in narrative succession rela-tionships that are simultaneous and meant to elude the structureof explicit articulation, a variety of perspectives taken up in turnmay provide more specificity about the way in which power isnegotiated in ritual and how ritual strategies construct distinctforms of domination and resistance. The following four perspectivesare essentially artificial but useful devices: (i) how ritualizationempowers those who more or less control the rite; (z) how theirpower is also limited and constrained; (3) how ritualization dom-inates those involved as participants; and (4) how this dominationinvolves a negotiated participation and resistance that also empow-ers them.How ritualization empowers those who control or regulate ritualpractices is probably the most documented aspect of the study ofritual. Bourdieu reflects a consensus of sorts when he suggests thatthose who control ritualization are in command of a particularlypowerful form of objectification, especially in cultures where thereare relatively few other institutionalized structures to rival it.189Bloch also views ritualization as a more or less institutionalizedmedium of objectification, one that constitutes traditional forms ofauthority through techniques of formalization that render this au-thority relatively invulnerable to casual challenge. Echoing Weber,Bloch demonstrates how ritualization depersonalizes authority,lodging the power of the specialist in an office or formal status, notin the person. In this way, a whole system or social order based onoffice and status is also reinforced. The ritual construction of au-thority is a stabilization of power and therein a specific augmen-tation of power. For if power is demonstrated as bestowed on theproper person by external sources, such as ancestors or deities, thatpower comes to be seen as vast, legitimate, and accessible only tothose in the appropriate offices. In describing the perfection of sucha form of \"rule through ritual\" in Asia, Lucien Pye characterizesthis delineation of power as \"the highest kind\" in terms of sheerscope, justification, and limited accessibility.190 Geertz, as noted"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"2.12Ritual and Powerearlier, also described the political empowerment of ritual \"display\"in very similar terms.These studies yield at least three ways in which the empowermentof those who most control ritualization is constituted: the objec-tification of office, the hierarchization of practices, and tradition-alization. Yet this should not be taken as a definitive list of thestrategies of this form of empowerment. Nor should the potentialefficacy of such strategies obscure the real limits of the power soconstituted. Despite his observations as to its scope, Pye readilyacknowledges that empowerment through ritual can be very un-wieldy and constraining. Indeed, more than a few scholars havenoted some of the specific limits of this form of power throughritualization. In essence, their insights appear to develop one of theconclusions that Gluckman reached in his analyses of the ritualcontainment of conflict—the intrinsically and categorically conser-vative nature of ritual. For example, both Bloch and Pye find thatthe ritual construction of traditional authority is very inflexible anddiffuse. It is often a liability that so much authority is so looselyattached to the person, while being so tightly attached to office.Pye goes on to note that when power is seen as external to theactor, it can render cause and effect so complicated that the processis nearly invisible. Such power can establish authority, but not forany precision of purpose or application. Serving as \"a rather blunttool,\" this form of power cannot in itself generate an agenda ofproblem-solving plans or specific policy decisions.191Bloch similarly observes that such traditional authority is ulti-mately disconnected from the real world. In the case of the Merina,he describes how the power and authority created by the highlystructured patterns and impoverished language of formal oratoryalso render that authority unable to deal with specific problems,creating the need for another level of nonformalized discourse.I9ZJust as the belief structures that may undergird ritual power can beneither proved nor disproved, so the successes and failures of theapplication of this power are also beyond real proof or disproof.Such power is vindicated only by general and continued well-being;it is indicted by widespread and sustained social problems.193Just as contractual authority must be renewed (implying the pe-riodic option of choice) and coercive force must be constantly vig-ilant in maintaining its threat, in the same way power constituted"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"The Power of Ritualization  213through ritualization must regularly sustain itself through the re-creation of tradition, the reobj edification of office, and the repro-duced display of its magnificence.194 A breakdown in the cycle ofrites that create ritualized power, or a breakdown in the semblanceof conformity to traditional models, can quickly fragment the il-lusion of social cohesion. As noted earlier, the criteria for and thevalue of coherence with tradition can be quite different in oral andliterate societies, but the constraint on ritual remains roughly thesame: it must be legitimated and authenticated by those whom itaffects, as Valeri has described so vividly for the Hawaiian systemof kingship.195 The criteria for authentification are nothing less thana satisfying sense of adherence to precedent in addition to a closeresonance with lived experience—in other words, a collective con-fidence in the continued well-being of the society along with anindividual sense of participation in a process of redemptive activity.However, if the ritual construction of power on the higher levelsof social organization builds on the microrelations of power thatshape daily life on the lower levels of the society, changes in thelatter level can precipitate a crisis in which the demands of ritualto conform to traditional models clash with the ability of thoserites to resonate with the real experiences of the social body. Thisis certainly a well-known and widespread phenomenon, and thevery type addressed by Geertz in his analysis of the Javanese funeralanalyzed in Part I. In Fernandez's study of the Bwiti, a reform cultamong the Fang, the constituency of an old ritual master pressedhim in vain for new rites of a type like the innovations of othernearby groups. With his refusal they deserted him to join othercults. Eventually he had to swallow his pride in order to be part ofthe community and their new activities.196 The traditionalism, au-thority, and dramaturgy of ritual power can be as fragile as theycan be impressive and enduring.How people are controlled or manipulated by ritual, as noted atthe beginning of this section, is also well represented in the litera-ture. Here, however, I do not wish to pursue how the strategies ofdomination implemented in ritual appropriate minds and bodies,but rather how they engage them in a set of tensions that involveboth domination and resistance. This engagement, as Foucault hasargued, must also be understood as constitutive of the persons soengaged."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Ritual and PowerIn a basic sense, when nonspecialist ritual participants are dif-ferentiated from ritual specialists, a differentiation displayed in andproduced through ritual, lay participants lose direct control over amajor medium of symbolic production and objectification. The re-sult, of course, is that they can affect only indirectly the construc-tions of 'reality' or 'the ideal' objectified through ritualizedactivities. Other social media may be more directly available to thelaity, if only to balance the power of ritual specialists, but the socialstratification that attends the presence of ritual specialists oftenimplies a more general division of labor that limits access to othersuch media as well. The lack of direct access to collective methodsof objectification means that the struggle to define the world inways most useful to the interests of the laity will be a covert one,both dependent upon specialists and resistant to them.A very simple example is the way in which most American Cath-olics do not agree with or practice the position on birth controlauthoritatively pronounced by the papacy in Rome. Their subver-sion always comes as a bit of a surprise to everyone but Catholics.Outsiders tend to assume that Catholics have internalized the au-thority of the pope, especially since the papacy looms as the singlemost distinctive institution of Catholicism and a classic instance oftraditional authority. Yet Catholics tend to think of their faith andchurch in terms of longstanding and idiosyncratic processes of ap-propriation, many of which may have little reference to Rome butgreat reference to the more immediate issues of local communi-ties.197 The 1987 visit of Pope John Paul to the United States is agood example: the pope was consistently greeted with the trulyenthusiastic fanfare of popular devotion, which is clear evidence ofan experience or a willingness to experience the charisma of officeand its person. Yet this devotion does not imply unreserved ornonnegotiable obedience. Catholicism is a consent to papal powerand a resistance to it at the same time. Moreover, those seen ascontrolled by ritual authority are not simply able to resist or limitthis power; they are also empowered by virtue of being participantsin a relationship of power.Bloch and others have drawn attention to the way in whichritualization catches people up in its own terms, asking little morethan a mere consent to the forms while relegating anything but themost concerted challenge to the non-threat of rudeness. \"You can-214"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"The Power of Ritualization  215not argue with a song,\" Bloch writes.198 The only real alternativeto negotiated compliance is either total resistance or asocial self-exclusion. Insofar as ritual is objectified as a distinct way of actingit provides a fairly resistant surface to casual disagreement. At thesame time, negotiated compliance offers manifold opportunities forstrategic appropriation, depending on one's mastery of socialschemes, even to the point of subversion. Nonetheless, any discus-sion of freedom and resistance in the ritual construction of power,although a corrective to theories of ritual control, should not min-imize how ritualization does appropriate and culturally school thesocial body. Negotiated consent, such as the resisting participantin a totalitarian rally, or the pursuit of alternative ritual activities,such as the home churches of disaffected Catholics, may qualifyand nuance the socialization effected by the dominant ritual activ-ities, but this relativizing and its tensions still shape the personhoodand the microdynamics of power within and among those involved.The orchestrated construction of power and authority in ritual,which is deeply evocative of the basic divisions of the social order,engage the social body in the objectification of oppositions and thedeployment of schemes that effectively reproduce the divisions ofthe social order. In this objectification lie the resonance of ritualand the consequences of compliance. As Bourdieu and Bloch sug-gest, one might retain one's limited and negotiated involvement inthe activities of ritual, but bowing or singing in unison imperceptiblyschools the social body in the pleasures of and schemes for actingin accordance with assumptions that remain far from conscious orarticulate.Yet it is crucial to demonstrate that the efficacy of ritualizationas a power strategy lies not only in the domination it affords, butin the resistance as well. Ritual mastery, that sense of ritual whichis at least a basic social mastery of the schemes and strategies ofritualization, means not only that ritualization is the appropriationof a social body but that the social body in turn is able to appropriatea field of action structured in great measure by others. The circu-larity of this phenomenon is intrinsic to it. Ritual mastery is itselfa capacity for and relationship of relative domination. It does notmerely socialize the body with schemes that structure and reproduceparts (large or small) of the social order, nor does it merely constructthe social person with versions of these schemes as the order of its"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"2.16  Ritual and Powersubjectivity and consciousness. To do all that it must also enablethe person to deploy schemes that can manipulate the social orderon some level and appropriate its categories for a semicoherentvision of personal identity and action. Socialization cannot be any-thing less than the acquisition of schemes that can potentially res-tructure and renuance both self and society. As a \"discursivepractice,\" ritual activity concerns knowledge (ritual mastery) thatis \"reproduced through practices made possible by the framingassumptions of that knowledge.\" These practices are \"a very prac-tical knowledge,\" which \"disciplines the body, regulates the mind,and orders the emotions in such a way that the ranking, hierarchyand stratification which ensues from these practices is not just theblind reproduction of a transcendent traditional order.\" The prac-tical knowledge that emerges by and through ritualization, what Ihave referred to as ritual mastery or the sense of ritual, whichstructures and fixes meanings in historical forms, is an \"accom-plishment of power.\"1\"As a strategic embodiment of schemes for power relationships—schemes that hierarchize, integrate, define, or obscure—ritualiza-tion can promote social solidarity. It can promote solidarity par-ticularly in a fairly homogeneous group with general recognitionof key symbols, where a sense of unity can be achieved throughconsent to the forms, and where most subgroups benefit in someway from the simultaneous integration and differentiation of thesocial order. This is not a matter of simply reinforcing shared beliefsor instilling a dominant ideology. At the same time, as a strategicembodiment of schemes for power relationships—schemes that canhierarchize, subordinate, integrate, define, and obscure—rituali-zation can also promote the forces that have been traditionallythought to work against social solidarity and control. Indeed, oneaspect of ritual mastery surely acquired in the processes of consent,resistance, and appropriation may be schemes for the differentiationof private and social selves. Some scholars, as noted earlier, haveseen ritual as a mechanism for the integration of the individual andsociety, or the individual and social dimensions of the self; others,such as Tambiah and Bloch, have noted the opposite. The formal-ization of ritual often appears to involve a distancing within actorsof their private and social identities. Tambiah suggests that suchdistancing may be integral to what ritual does on the one hand (i.e.,"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"The Power of Ritualization  2,17its elaboration of the symbolic), but also problematic if taken toofar. The result could be disassociation and disaffection, as well asthe cultural perception of empty ritualism and hypocrisy/00It is possible that ritualization itself can generate and deploysuch bifurcations of the self as that described by Durkheim as\"two beings facing in different and almost contrary direc-tions.\"101 If so, it would be a feature of ritualization in a partic-ular historical and cultural setting, a setting in which suchschemes would have some efficacious value outside the ritual.And indeed, something of the modern world and the modern selfis heard very forcibly in Durkheim's account of religion. Suchschemes of bifurcation of self, if present at all, may have workedvery differently in precolonial Tshidi and Hawaiian communities.Certainly Foucault concluded that in the emergence of meticu-lous rituals of corporal incarceration in the nineteenth century,we can witness the historical germination of the modern'souP.zoi The strategies of ritualization clearly generate forms ofpractice and empowerment capable of articulating an under-standing of the personal self vis-a-vis community, however thesemight be understood. The results might well be seen in terms ofthe continuity between self and community, or in terms of anautonomous identity. However, the result might also be the for-mation of a subjectivity that polarizes thought and action, thepersonal self and the social body. To take these possibilities seri-ously is to recognize that practice can give rise to thoughts, cog-nitive categories, and modes of perception. In this analysis, ritualis not devised to join what the modern world experiences as di-vided; rather, ritualization is one set of cultural practices thatcontributes to the formation of such experiences. Clearly, for theTshidi of the Zionist churches of the colonial era, ritualizationstrategies facilitated a perception that Durkheim claimed to be auniversal one—\"the antithesis which all men have more or lessclearly conceived between the body and the soul, the materialand the spiritual beings who coexist within us.\"203 And suchschemes of disassociation enabled them to resist (i.e., work outsome form of dominance and appropriation of) the oppressivedefinitions of the colonial order.For Durkheim, \"The believer who has communicated with hisgod is not merely a man who sees new truths of which the unbeliever"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"2,18  Ritual and Poweris ignorant; he is a man who is stronger. He feels within him moreforce, either to endure the trials of existence, or to conquer them.\"*04Durkheim's perception has been analyzed for too long only in termsof the so-called illusions generated by affective states of social en-thusiasm. Yet as the foregoing analysis suggests, his statement mayaccurately capture the truth of ritually constructed power relations,not the delusions of collective emotion. The person who has prayedto his or her god, appropriating the social schemes of the hegemonicorder in terms of an individual redemption, may be stronger becausethese acts are the very definitions of power, personhood, and thecapacity to act.The variety of evidence examined here has attempted to dem-onstrate that ritualization necessitates and engenders both consentand resistance. It does not assume or implement total social control;it is a flexible strategy, one that requires complicity to the point ofpublic consent, but not much more than that. Ultimately, the re-sistance it addresses and produces is not merely a limit on the rite'sability to control; it is also a feature of its efficacy.It is not totally inappropriate, or unexpected, that the end ofthis exploration of ritual should return to one of the originalquestions with which it began, however altered the relationshipwith it may be. In Part I of this book I demonstrated the coher-ent, closed, and circular discourse that results when ritual is castas a mechanism for the integration of thought and action, or selfand society. In this final part I find a coherent and circular clos-ing in the suggestion that ritual practices themselves can generatethe culturally effective schemes that yield the categories withwhich to differentiate self and society, thought and action. Thisis not to say that ritualization is the only form of practice thatdefines the self. Hardly. It is that form of practice where the def-inition is simultaneously embedded in the social body and its en-vironment, negotiated, and rendered prestigious by the privilegedstatus that ritualized activities claim.ConclusionThe preceding analyses do not add up to a new theory of ritual.This is deliberate, and for several reasons. First, I do not wish to"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"The Power of Ritualization  219imply or designate some independently existing object, named rit-ual, with a set of defining features that characterize all instances ofritual. Such an approach also implies that ritual so defined is readilyamenable to objective analysis and formulation without sufferingany distortion in the process. In addition, a theory of ritual wouldalso have to distinguish ritual from ceremony and ceremony frommagic and social etiquette, and so on—leading to a whole galaxyof independent and pure entities with static features. A second majorreason to avoid a theory of ritual is to free this analysis from therequired format of demonstrating the originality, systematicity, andgeneral applicability that a claim for a new theory would warrant.Many aspects of this study are intentionally experimental, devel-oped as an exploration of ways of not thinking about ritual as wellas ways of rethinking the idea and the data. Many of the discretepoints made here have been made before by others; the constructof originality often obscures rather than reveals the lines of thinkingabout the issue. It is also probable that many of the arguments Ihave laid out here replicate the structures they attempt to discernand discard. This may have its virtues as a form of further evidenceof the real constraints on thinking about acting and of the strategiesof argument-building. Although a writer cannot evade the blind-nesses that are the flip side of his or her insights, both can be madeuseful to the reader.What I have attempted to do is forge a framework for reana-lyzing the types of activities usually understood as ritual. At afundamental level, this framework attempts to return such ritualactivities to the context of human action in general. Ritual is notassumed to exist as a natural category of human practice. Withinthis interpretive framework some activities are performed in cul-turally relevant ways to generate the perception that these activi-ties are both intrinsically different from other acts and privilegedin their significance and ramifications. The framework proposedhere focuses, therefore, on the generation of what we call ritualas a way of acting, namely, the ritualization of activity. It is pos-sible that further progress along this line will yield sufficient de-tail to generalize more effectively about cultural strategies ofritualization vis-a-vis other strategies, but that is beyond thescope of this initial study. Some preliminary generalizationshave, nonetheless, been suggested. Within the framework of ac-"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"2,2,0  Ritual and Powertivity, specifically the context formed by the cultural spectrum ofways of acting and what they imply, several features emerge asvery common to ritualization: strategies of differentiationthrough formalization and periodicity, the centrality of the body,the orchestration of schemes by which the body defines an envi-ronment and is defined in turn by it, ritual mastery, and the ne-gotiation of power to define and appropriate the hegemonicorder.When returned to the context of human activity in general, so-called ritual acts must be seen first in terms of what they share withall activity, then in terms of how they set themselves off from otherpractices. Ritualization is fundamentally a way of doing things totrigger the perception that these practices are distinct and the as-sociations that they engender are special. A great deal of strategyis employed simply in the degree to which some activities are ri-tualized and therein differentiated from other acts. While formal-ization and periodization appear to be common techniques forritualization, they are not intrinsic to 'ritual' per se; some ritualizedpractices distinguish themselves by their deliberate informality, al-though usually in contrast to a known tradition or style of ritual-ization. Hence, ritual acts must be understood within a semanticframework whereby the significance of an action is dependent uponits place and relationship within a context of all other ways ofacting: what it echoes, what it inverts, what it alludes to, what itdenies.Aside from the strategic and privileged distinctions establishedby ritualization, another primary way it acts is through a focus onthe body, specifically the interaction of the body within a highlystructured environment. I have suggested that the body of the so-cialized participant structures an environment but sees only thebody's response to a supposedly preexisting set of structures. Thephysical movements of the socialized body within this demarcatedspace and time generate an endlessly circular run of oppositionsthat come to be loosely homologized to each other, deferring theirsignificance to other oppositions so that the meaning of any oneset of symbols or references depends upon the significance of others.By virtue of movement and stillness, sound and silence, throughwhich the body produces and reabsorbs these oppositional schemes,an orchestration is effected in which some schemes come to dom-"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"The Power of Ritualization  2,2,1inate and interpret others. The ability to produce schemes thathierarchize and integrate in complex ways is part and parcel of thepractical knowledge acquired in and exercised through ritualization.The ultimate purpose of ritualization is neither the immediate goalsavowed by the community or the officiant nor the more abstractfunctions of social solidarity and conflict resolution: it is nothingother than the production of ritualized agents, persons who havean instinctive knowledge of these schemes embedded in their bodies,in their sense of reality, and in their understanding of how to actin ways that both maintain and qualify the complex microrelationsof power. Such practical knowledge is not an inflexible set of as-sumptions, beliefs, or body postures; rather, it is the ability todeploy, play, and manipulate basic schemes in ways that appro-priate and condition experience effectively. It is a mastery thatexperiences itself as relatively empowered, not as conditioned ormolded.With these same schemes the activities of ritualization generatehistorical traditions, geographical systems, and levels of profes-sionals. Just as a rite cannot be understood apart from a full spec-trum of cultural forms of human action in general, so it must alsobe seen in the context of other ritualized acts as well. The construc-tion of traditions and subtraditions, the accrual of professional andalternative expertise—all are effected by the play of schemes in-voked through ritualization.When placed within this framework, the work accomplishedthrough ritualization is very inadequately grasped by the notion ofsocial control. Ritualization is not a matter of transmitting sharedbeliefs, instilling a dominant ideology as an internal subjectivity, oreven providing participants with the concepts to think with. Theparticular construction and interplay of power relations effected byritualization defines, empowers, and constrains. Ritualized prac-tices, of necessity, require the external consent of participants whilesimultaneously tolerating a fair degree of internal resistance. Assuch they do not function as an instrument of heavy-handed socialcontrol. Ritual symbols and meanings are too indeterminate andtheir schemes too flexible to lend themselves to any simple processof instilling fixed ideas.

Ritual and Powera sense of community without overriding the autonomy of individ-uals or subgroups. Ritualization as any form of social control, how-ever indirectly defined, will be effective only when this control canafford to be rather loose. Ritualization will not work as socialcontrol if it is perceived as not amenable to some degree of indi-vidual appropriation. If practices negate all forms of individualchoice, or all forms of resistance, they would take a form otherthan ritualization. Basic to what makes Foucault's \"rites of penaldiscipline\" a matter of ritualization rather than the use of a met-aphor is the form of consent and resistance still afforded the sub-jugated participant even if it be no more than a recognition of thelimits placed on the activities of the subjugator. For example, thecourt-ordered flogging of an accused thief would play up its ownritual nature (ritualize its activities) in a display of power that si-multaneously recognized its own limits—in the number of strokes,their intensity, the personal uninvolvement of the officer doing theflogging, and so on. Ritualization cannot turn a group of individualsinto a community if they have no other relationships or interestsin common, nor can it turn the exercise of pure physical compulsioninto participatory communality. Ritualization can, however, takearbitrary or necessary common interests and ground them in anunderstanding of the hegemonic order; it can empower agents inlimited and highly negotiated ways.Ultimately, the notion of ritual is constructed in the image of theconcerns of a particular cultural era. Certainly, analyzing the socialand cultural import of ritual activities is a form of practice knownonly to secular societies that make a distinction between the pursuitof objective knowledge and the practice of religion. The study ofritual is surely a cultural corollary to the antiritualism that Douglasfinds common in secular societies. It might be more: A strategicdichotomizing of thought and action may well be basic to the prag-matic negotiations of 'self and 'society' in such secular cultures.The formal study of ritual itself, therefore, may be more than asimple reflection of secularism; it might be yet another arena fornegotiating the relations between the practice of knowledge and thepractice of religion.Any new theory, even a new framework, overstates its case.

In an analysis of Freud's approach to ritual, Volney Gay argues thatFreud saw ritual not as pathologically \"repressive,\" as Freud's well-known comparison of ritual with obsessive disorders might imply,but as nonpathologically \"suppressive.\" Suppression, according toGay, is freely chosen by the ego from \"among alternative actionswhich can help it avoid or reduce interpersonal conflict yet also offerdrive satisfaction\" (Freud on Ritual [Missoula, Mont.: Scholars Press,1979], P- 185).18.

Such a role for ritual does little to explicate particular acts but muchto constitute a discourse structured around the resolution of dicho-tomies or the embodiment of fundamental contradictions. Ultimately,theories of ritual as social control tend to define ritual and controland society in terms that do not merely complement each other butmagnetically draw each other into a tight knot of deferredsignifications.30.

Aside from the segregation of groups and conflicts,Gluckman does not allude to other reasons for the absence of ritualin modern secular societies, although he does note an ethos of an-tiritualism which engenders self-consciousness about recourse to any-thing like \"tribal-type rituals\" (Essays on the Ritual of SocialRelations, pp. 43-45, 48).34.

This is the position of Rodney Needham, in particular, who arguesthat belief is an individual mental state and is best left to psychology.Social analysis may address how society induces and shapes suchmental states, but it does not have the ability to determine what aperson's mental state is and whether it constitutes a state of \"belief\"as such. Even if beliefs refer to cultural views, statements made aboutwhat is believed, by both informants and ethnographers, can rarelybe demonstrated to be true in the sense that they are believed by allor most people in the society. Furthermore, Needham cautions, peo-ple do not necessarily believe what they have been taught to say andmany will privately question what their society holds to be a belief.For these reasons and others, Needham is not alone is recommendingthat the word \"belief\" be dropped in anthropological studies. SeeRodney Needham, Belief, Language and Experience (Chicago: Uni-versity of Chicago Press, 1972,).52,. Martin Southwold critiques assumptions that belief is an individualmental state or subject to judgments of truth or falsity. He makes acase for the social nature of belief—as a matter of activities, such as"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"2.2,8  Notesassenting, affirming, or making formal obeisances, and social rela-tionships—rather than some disembodied state of mind. See MartinSouthwold, \"Religious Belief,\" Man, n.s. 14, no. 4 (1978): 62.8-44,especially pp. 62.5, 62.8, 632., 637-3 8, and 643 note 5. While agreeingwith Needham that beliefs are rarely absolute in their hold on in-dividuals or groups, Abner Cohen finds that they are much morepowerful for what they do socially (Two-Dimensional Man: An Essayon the Anthropology of Power and Symbolism in Complex Society[Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976], p. 83).5 3. For a basic analysis of these and other approaches, see Mary B. Black,\"Belief Systems,\" in Handbook of Social and Cultural Anthropology,ed. John J. Honigmann (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1973), pp. 509-77; and Kenneth Thompson, Beliefs and Ideology (London: Tavis-tock Publications, 1986), pp. 11—2.6, for a discussion of thisapproach.54. Southwold, p. 633. Among the Singhalese, for example, Southwoldfound that no judgments of truth or falsity were made about suchtenets as the Buddha's attainment of nirvana or the karmic deter-mination of existence. However, there was a readiness to questionthe effectiveness of various rituals, the need for the services of Bud-dhist monks, and the existence of lesser deities. He concludes thatbasic religious beliefs are not concerned with issues that we associatewith factual truth, and they probably never could be and still actas religious truths. Leach also notes the ambiguity and \"essentialvagueness of all ritual statements\" (Political Systems of HighlandBurma, p. 186).55. Southwold, pp. 629—34. Tambiah also finds that ritual is meant toexpress not mental orientations of individuals, but attitudes of in-stitutionalized discourse (\"A Performative Approach to Ritual,\"pp. 12.4-2,5).56.

Fernandez even finds that effective communication was resisted soas to continue ritual activity (\"Symbolic Consensus,\" p. 92,2.).59. Fernandez does the same thing that Geertz did in setting up hiscategories in his analysis of the Javanese funeral: ritual is defined associal action as opposed to cultural beliefs. However, whereas Geertzargues that (successful) ritual also integrates action and belief, societyand culture, ethos and worldview, Fernandez ends up opposing the"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Notes   2,2.9social to the cultural, activity to concept, significance to meaning,sign to symbol, social solidarity to cultural disjunction, etc. (\"Sym-bolic Consensus,\" pp. 911-2.1). Indeed, by characterizing the unityachieved through the patterned and regularized activities of ritual asunity on a social level, not on a cultural level, Fernandez explicitlydistances belief from what is fundamental to ritual (\"Symbolic Con-sensus,\" pp. 902, 907, 911-14)-60.

A good example is Evans-Pritchard's famous confrontation withAzande reasoning. Logical analysis of the effects of termites on thegranary, while apparent and relevant to Azande reckoning, was un-able to account adequately for the specificity of the granary killingthe particular people sitting underneath it. See E. E. Evans-Pritchard,Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande (Oxford: Clar-endon Press, 1965), pp. 63-70, especially p. 69.74. Converse calls attention to those pockets of the population, mostcommon in the rural hinterlands of the Soviet Union or the People'sRepublic of China, where people often have little sense of belongingto a larger nation. The \"nation\" as such is an abstract entity thatthey do not experience in daily life (p. 2,37). National rituals, whichdo not penetrate far into such communities, would not receive muchsupport if forced, given the dearth of any concrete experience of thenation as such. Even the \"synchronization\" of local rites across thenation or the standardization of local forms to conform to a modelfor national celebrations have little effect on isolated communities.75. Rappaport, p. 193.76. Kertzer, p. 95.

Kertzer, p. 72,.78. A practical example of their interrelationship is seen in the verydifferent work of Geertz and Bourdieu, each of whom proposes de-scriptions of religion and ideology on separate occasions that areremarkably similar. Compare Geertz's \"Religion as a Cultural Sys-tem\" with his \"Ideology as a Cultural System,\" both reproduced inThe Interpretation of Cultures.79. J. G.

This perspective is sometimes used for homogeneous tribal societiesin contrast to the second approach, which is seen to fit the socialstratification of more complex and pluralistic societies. Comaroffnotes the explicit coexistence of \"worldview\" and \"ideology\" in pre-colonial Tswana (p. 12.5).82. The negative side of this perspective, however, is that it leads to theassumption that culture is a separate realm of metasocial phenomena.Analysis must then attempt to show how the more abstract featuresof social life are linked to its concrete features. As seen in the workof structural Marxists like Althusser, Godelier, and Bloch, culture asideology serves to create a level of social processes that supposedlymediates opposing material and idealist levels of human existence.See Ortner, \"Theory in Anthropology,\" p. 140.83. J. B. Thompson critiques the tendency to see ideology as social cement(p. 5). For K. Thompson, ideology as such is embedded in rituals(pp. 23-24 and 72). Merquior critiques Althusser's structural Marx-ism for how he assumes that power pervades society in the guise ofbelief (The Veil and the Mask, p. 36).84. For Althusser, for example, ideology expresses the collective, but itdoes so as a mystification that is essential for social reproduction.See Dowling, p. 83; also Jacques Ranciere, \"On the Theory of Ide-ology (The Politics of Althusser),\" Radical Philosophy 7 (1974): 2-3. Ortner argues that in this extreme view ritual, myth and taboomerely maintain the status quo (\"Theory in Anthropology Since theSixties,\" pp. 140-41).85. K. Thompson is representative of this criticism, specifically arguingthat ideologies do not necessarily promote consensus or social soli-darity (p. 33).86. Merquior, The Veil and the Mask, pp. 5—7.87.

Mer-quior wishes to pursue a less \"mentalist\" and more \"behavioristic\"approach and does so by \"seeing ideology as part of the empiricalmechanics of power\" (The Veil and the Mask, p. 15).94. According to K. Thompson, Gramsci's notion of \"negotiation\"avoids the deficiencies of theories of culture as social control or socialexpression (p. loz).

The term \"manipulation of bias\" was firstcoined by E. E. Schattschneider (The Semi-Sovereign People: A Real-ist's View of Democracy in America [New York: Holt, Rinehart andWinston, 1960] but became central to the debates on the nature ofpower with its use by Peter Bachrach and Morton S. Baratz (Powerand Poverty: Theory and Practice [Oxford: Oxford University Press,1970]). For a good overview of these debates and the place of thisterm, see Clegg, pp. 1-2.0, especially p. iz.96. Merquior, The Veil and the Mask, pp. 2.7-2.9. Bourdieu also arguesthat ideologies function primarily to integrate the dominant classwhile simultaneously distinguishing it from other groups (\"SymbolicPower,\" p. 114).97. Merquior, The Veil and the Mask, p. 35.98. Merquior, The Veil and the Mask, pp. 2.6-2,7.99. See J. B. Thompson's discussion of Bourdieu's theory of complicity,which he challenges as \"too consensual\" (pp. 44-46, 58-59, 62).Thompson suggests that the dominated class may misrecognize thedominant value system in some form as the only workable value sys-tem, particularly if the alternatives remain unformulated or incoherent.They may also misrecognize how the value system of the dominant classactually divides, even when it disguises itself as a means of communi-cation and consensus among the whole (in this regard, see Bourdieu,\"Symbolic Power,\" pp. 114-15). Thus, the dominated classes may ac-cept at face value a status hierarchy that rigidly and arbitrarily dividesand ranks because the hierarchy proclaims that such a clear system al-lows anyone to ascend and change status.100.

One advantage of a focus on ideology instead of belief is the readinessof ideology studies to attempt to analyze the ways in which theindividual is addressed, involved, or constituted. Althusser has madefamous the notion that ideologies \"interpellate\" persons or com-munities as subjects: in being addressed an identity is constituted.

His alternative \"analytics of power\" attempts to sidestep therhetoric of theory that implies some 'thing,' called power, whichexists.

Compare this point toLukes's thesis (versus Poulantzas) that to exercise power per se onemust be able to choose to do otherwise (Lukes, Power, p. 55).161.

Particular examples from Foucault's Discipline and Punish includethe following: penal ceremony as the rite that \"concluded the crime\"(p. 9), rituals of execution (p. n), penal ritual (p. 18), a ritual ofpublic torture (p. 28), the liturgy of punishment (pp. 34, 49), legalceremonial (p. 35), penal liturgy (p. 47), the ritual of armed law (p.50), public execution ritualized as a political operation (p. 53), powerrecharged in a ritual display of its reality (p. 57), and power relationsritualized (p. 68). For other examples, see his History of Sexuality,vol. i, and \"Nietzsche, Genealogy, History,\" in The Foucault Reader,ed. Paul Rabinow (New York: Pantheon, 1984).166. Dreyfus and Rabinow, p. no.167. Dreyfus and Rabinow, p. in.168. Foucault, Discipline and Punish, p. 25.169. Foucault, Discipline and Punish, p. 28.170. For Foucault's understanding of strategy, see \"The Subject andPower,\" pp. 224-25. Ultimately, power relationships are not reallyeven relationships—the power relationship \"is no more a 'relation-ship' than the place where it occurs is a place; and, precisely for thisreason, it is fixed, throughout its history, in rituals, in meticulousprocedures that impose rights and obligations\" (Foucault,\"Nietzsche, Genealogy, History,\" p. 85)."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Notes  237171.

The spirit of these ideas is nottotally foreign to a perspective within cultural anthropology that haspushed toward just such an analysis of the cultural construction ofperception, awareness, and individuality. Yet Foucault's analysis ofthese constructions in terms of power is challenging. Ultimately hisagenda goes beyond an attempt to explore the dynamism of sociallife from within its own terms; it includes a recognition of the in-volvement of the theoretical enterprise itself and of the interrelation-ships among techniques of objectification, knowledge, discourse,truth, and power.175. Foucault, Power/Knowledge, p. 187.176. Foucault, Power/Knowledge, p. 98. Foucault's discussions of subjec-tivity and the individualizing as well as totalizing power of the statemake clear that power relations may be constituted on a variety oflevels, among which subjectivity/subjectivization and individuality/individualization may figure. See Foucault, Power/Knowledge,pp. 2.39, 2.55; Discipline and Punish, p. 99; and Dreyfus and Rabi-now, pp. 120, 139, 143.177. Foucault, Power/Knowledge, p. 98.178. Again, compare Lukes, who argues that power is not something thatis \"exercised\" as such—i.e., brought to bear on people consciouslyor unconsciously in an intentional ways (Power, pp. 39—40).179. For examples of the resistance of the constituted body, see Foucault,Power/Knowledge, pp. 56-57.180. Foucault, Discipline and Punish, pp. 2.3-31, 47-57, 68-69; Power/Knowledge, pp. 55-62.181. Wuthnow, pp. 111—14, 124—28.182. The schemes may also derive in part from the existence of largersocial organizations in which the smaller ritual community isembedded.183. Clegg, p. 166.184. Lukes notes how ritual provides the sense that the individual's needsand wants are being transformed in public or social policy. See Lukes,\"Political Ritual and Social Integration,\" pp. 304-5.185. Comaroff, pp. 6—8, 81, 124—27. As noted in Part II, her analysis fallsinto some of the problems attending notions of ritual as \"mediating\"structure and event (or history and practice) and \"resolving\" con-tradictions between cultural categories and social experiences.186.
